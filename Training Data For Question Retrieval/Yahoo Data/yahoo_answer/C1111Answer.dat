yRWmArJuaa	Hey i bleach my upper lip,  I buy Jolen cream bleach which you can get from supermarkets and other places its easy to get hold of    Follow the instructions it gives you and yes your skin needs to be fairly light as it also bleaches your skin too    For me it tingles a teeny bit but isnt a problem and it lasts for up to two weeks, The hair does not get thicker it just stays disguised.    Hope ive helped Good luck :)  xx|`|y7fvIDhqaa	I wax mine and sometimes I pluck it when I see the some hair coming back. I like to wax mine because when it comes back, it's not thicker but don't get me wrong it does come back in a week. I just hated bleaching my upper lip because there was like a burning sensation to it. I guess it's from the chemical they use to whiten hair. Just use whatever that works for you. Good Luck|`|pZ7B7VFcaa	no bleaching is having hair there just lighter so whats the point      try threading it works well for me    plus i am plannig to use that spring like hair removal tool its called Epicare i think    here is a link    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGbvrEQ4N...|`|EY0wnkh3aa	OK go get it threaded! That's where they do it with the string but it doesn't hurt that much and it takes forever to grow back! Bleaching will work but it will look like a blonde mustache. Won't do anything really. It's only like 5 dollars to get it threaded and you could get it done at the mall. I know this girl that has really nasty upper lip hair and EWWW it's dark and thick as hell and she seriously needs to do something about it. Don't be like here, lol.|`|xkSuKSn8aa	I worry that with your skin tone it will make the hair stand out more. I used bleach for years, but my skin is normally fair.   Then I started waxing, MUCH better results. Go to a cosmetology school and have it done, or where you get your hair cut. You can get better results that way. If you do it at home I like the Nair wax you heat in the microwave. A thin layer, hold your skin below it, and rip it off upwards. Hurts like a bugger, but it gets easier with time.  My daughter has the same problem and I am waxing her at 10 yrs old. I figure by the time she is in college her hair will have given up the fight and stopped growing.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Wax it or pluck it    DON'T shave it.|`|Ve4KE0n5aa	You can bleach it but people will be able to see it a little bit.
AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.    Because you have light skin, I would choose light to medium hues. For blue eyes, the best colors are coppers, oranges, pinks, peaches, golds, yellow-based browns, orange-based browns, bronzes, peachy-beige, yellow-beige, and (sometimes) silver. Without seeing a picture of you, I would say you would just have to play around a bit to find the right combinations.    If you want a sculpted eye look, sweep a lighter shade across the entire lid (gold, peach, or beige) and a medium shade in the crease (brown or copper). Put a dab of white creme shadow on the brow bone and on the inner corners of your eyes. Use a Dark Brown or Dark Copper liner instead of black, and line 2/3 of the way in on your upper and lower lash lines.    If you want a more smokey eye, sweep a lighter shade across the entire lid (gold, peach, or beige), and use a denser brush (crease brush) and apply a medium shade just above your lash line and extend to the outter corners of your eyes. Blend into the lighter shade, and never blend the medium color above your eye lid crease. It should look darker along the lash line and on the outter corners of your eyes. Use a Dark Brown liner to line the outter 1/2 of your upper and lower lash line, making sure to smudge on the lower lash line.    Peaches always compliment pale skin and blue eyes, so I would find a staple peach eyeshadow, such as Mac's Paradisco. Also, when you have pale skin, warmer colors tend to look better, so stay away from silvers, blues, purples, etc. They can make you look even more pale.    Hope this helps! :)|`|W8gSKNzdaa	i have light skin, blonde hair and blue eyes lol. i wear a sort of goldy/light brown eyeshadow, it looks quite natural and the gold makes it sparkle a bit. i think it looks quite good. hope this helps :) xxx|`|IIpEaDCcaa	Brown eyeliner & gold eyeshadow always looks good on blonde girls w/blue eyes.|`|pXTUMTdEaa	i would try a lavender, keep it light maybe silver|`|hJagdJIQaa	Any kind of brown, light blues, or green.|`|JMEghB3Zaa	all shades of brown would look good, or gold, or yellow, or orange.|`|omegLbOAaa	brown, tan, copper & even some orange tones really make blue eyes POP.    stay away from blue - after all, you wouldn't display a sapphire on a blue velvet, right? And pinks/purples can make blue eyes look bloodshot.
VtPZmOC1aa	If your hair is a medium brown or lighter, you can use the 20 volume developer.  Mix equal parts color with developer.  2 oz. of color = 2 oz. of developer.|`|37lOUk7Caa	OMG just look on your receipt...call the sally's, their phone number will be on the receipt. They can tell you exactly what you need. Also, these products often recommend that you should use whichever number of developer but you can actually use other developer (sometimes) but the timing has to be adjusted. The sally's  tech can help you with this. Call them. If the number isn't on you receipt look them up in the phone book.

JZnRxPUCaa	This is simple, great things to use to clean the piercing is:  1. warm water with salt in it. It helps to heal, and disinfect  2. Saline solution that you use with contacts. That is great too.  3. Or find a nice anti-bacterial soap and cleanse your piercing while in the shower.  Hope this helps!|`|UkhAYJxhaa	Use plain soap and just wash it out. Use sailine every couple of days. If it starts to get infected put disifection cream on it and cover it up until it gets better!|`|FlUxm0wOaa	I don't think you should use alcohol because I don't think it heals I think it makes it worse, if there's a claires around where u live you should go ahead and buy the cleanser for peircings|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	Anti bacterial soap (ie Dial) and warm salt water soaks.
GfMRewh7aa	nahh i think there all cute, i love the 3rd one, but i think there all nightclub suitable.|`|egN478Bbaa	Love the first one, classy yet very hot!|`|fagMeWXHaa	first one|`|4EQfEQhxaa	the first one for suree.|`|b0z0pbdXaa	I guess any of them would work, if your going for that slutie look.|`|TOljxMLMaa	The first one in black.

Its really cute..|`|NNRDS90oaa	first one
YIplumj8aa	Rocketwife is right on; however I do want to add that if your tattoo looks dry, put lotion on it!  Don't just do it twice a day because that's what you've been told.  Your tattoo shouldn't dry out during the healing process; any time the area looks dry, put lotion on it.  Now don't over do it - make sure your tattoo still has room to breathe!|`|xshrKvIRaa	No, it's fine. It's just your top layer of skin peeling off. All of my tattoos did that too. Just remember DON'T pick at it. Leave it alone to fall off by iteself. If you pick it, it can pull out the ink and look faded.|`|kCdISEGqaa	I promise the tattoo won't come out.  If it does, I'll redo it for free!!!  It is just the top layer of skin peeling and scabbing, it will scab and peel in the colors of the tattoo, but, remember, the tattoo is three layers deep, it will not come out.  It may look faded as well, but give it time, they take about an entire month to completely heal.  The scabbing and peeling is annoying, but it's all part of the process.  Best wishes!!!
rwVJ72Dwaa	yep! it's perfectly fine.  i do the same thing in the mornings as well.  just make sure you put the retin-a on first so it can be absorbed better.   then put on your night cream on top of it after a few minutes.  i found it works better this way, because then your face is moisturized and reducing scars at the same time!  =)
GeyFdO5jaa	Once you have purchased the perfect leather coat, you want to keep it looking great for seasons to come. Leather coats can be expensive, and the investment deserves a great deal of care to make sure you are wearing your signature style for years into the future. Depending on use, with preventative maintenance and proper care your leather coat can last indefinitely.  A few simple tips can help you maintain your leather coat. First, always hang leather coats on wide, padded hangers to ensure that you don't stretch or puncture corners or shoulders.  When storing your leather coat over the summer months, avoid storing leather goods in plastic bags or other non-porous covers, because leather is best preserved if it can "breathe." If clothing must be stored in a garment bag, keep it open for ventilation or choose a natural fabric garment bag. Place in a cool, dry closet to store, not in any area with excess moisture.    Always allow wet or damp leather to air dry naturally away from any source of heat, to avoid mildew build up or scorching from a heat source. To prevent mildew, protect never store your leather coat in an area with excessive humidity.    Otherwise, in a dry environment like the western states, regularly condition your leather coat to prevent drying and cracking. Apply a little leather conditioner when the leather is nearly dry to restore flexibility to your leather coat. Follow this first treatment with a full conditioning treatment after the leather has completely air dried.    Avoid using waxes, silicone, or other leather preparations on your leather coat which will impair the natural ability for the leather to breathe. Also, don't use caustic household cleaners, which can dry out or stain leather coats.    Leather coats, including traditional leather, suede, nubuck, and shearling, the skins can absorb and retain dirt if not treated or protected. While some leather treatments should be avoided because they can damage the natural skin, if you select a quality product and spot test it on an inconspicuous part of your leather coat, a treatment for waterproofing can be helpful to increase the wear of your leather coat.    As to cleaning your leather coat, usually you can clean your coat once per season, with either a polish or a protecting spray. With all things in life, moderation is to be remembered, as over cleaning can lead to a build up of product on your leather coat.    If you have an unfortunate accident and spill something on your leather coat, you are best served to avoid rubbing the stain in to the grain of the leather. Always blot dry any stains. You can remove dry stains and marks by softly rubbing a pencil eraser on affected areas. There are also dry cleaners that specialize in spot treatments for stains on leather, though few will guarantee their results as stains on leather are quite difficult to remove. Bottom line - be as careful as you can to avoid the stains in the first place!|`|KWko8dPCaa	dry cleaners|`|Q5qEsvVAaa	try not to pour liquids that would stain it. if it is beige, grey or a light color|`|e17JeFTLaa	Hummmm I think Miss smiley up there covered it purty good for ya dude,,,thumbs up to her .|`|nA9pQZflaa	Saddle soap or Mink Oil.....is right products.  X|`|ivhojwpTaa	Dry cleaner? How about expensive!  Whatever you do, DON'T wash it in the machine!  Hand wash with an abrasive pad for stubborn stains, and other than that, buy a good leather cleaner.
z0Wkh9hDaa	I love the colour of the blue one! It's gorgeous!  You can use belts, nice bags/purses, Big chunky bracelets are in at the moment so i'm sure you can find them around easily enough, a nice necklace, earrings and shoes are always an accessory.   Obviously don't use all of those! Don't forget less is more :)  Just some ideas! I'm sure you'll look fabulous!|`|dkbEhQgWaa	i definitely like the teal one the most|`|l8UFKysVaa	The blue one. Then for accessories i would say a necklace [around the same blue if you have it] and cool blue, white or black shoes.|`|fVasLC0gaa	they are all v.ugly why dont you wear a simple black dress [if you have one] and wear black heels,a thick red belt and some red braclets and necklace.  hope this helps enjoy your dinner!!|`|t93CQekvaa	To be honest I dont care for any of them,but if I had to pick one it would be the blue one.|`|MIILkAR4aa	the blue one|`|a3QNUrdfaa	go with the blue one. id wear it either w/a nice pair of boots or a pair of leggings and flats. A long necklace might be nice, w/some hoop earrings. (or whatever jewelry is ur style)|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I like the 1st one. I'm sure you'll look real cute in it. I think a small dainty necklace or gold chain.|`|R6Z8onywaa	theyre kinda ugly, look like something you wear to school.    options  http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/store/cat...  http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/store/cat...  http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/store/cat...  http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/store/cat...  http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/store/cat...  http://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/store/cat...|`|82niQjyCaa	I would get the blue bubble dress in black and wear it with a chunky belt and flats or possibly heels x|`|Fw0Zwds7aa	The 2nd and 3rd one are the same link! I like the 2nd one best though!!      Have fun!!      x
wUdweNSmaa	$100 is low for real uggs. But you can find some discounted uggs for that price.|`|dUIUSAu8aa	you can always try ebay|`|FlUxm0wOaa	Wow u asked the right person, watchout for sights that sell fake uggs becuase there are sights like that. Okay sheepskinshoes.com I believe is selling sand ugg boots tall for only 99 dollars and shipping is free if its over like 75 bucks or soemthing|`|dkbEhQgWaa	you can either try and find some on ebay or you could go to Macy's and get EMU boots they look like uggs and they are from Australia|`|fagMeWXHaa	Maybe ebay.    Sorry i couldnt help more.
kCdISEGqaa	There are many ways to do it.  I have clients that work from a central piece and we build around it with smaller images and backgrounds.  Some people put a lot of images in one area and build a background off it those.  It all depends on what you want.  I personally like theme tattoos, when the owner has a focus.  I don't really like doing a lot of small tattoos and then working to build a background around them.  It is easier for the artists if you have thought it through before going in.  Big bold images are my favorite, I like working with the flow of the body, so that the images fit well.  Take some ideas to an artist in your area, and have them throw some ideas at you.  You may be surprised!!!  Have fun with it!!!|`|2SzYXPrHaa	Consultations with a reputable tattoo artist.|`|yJYaEhqgaa	You might try one of those online galleries. You can print designs on transparency paper and see how they will look. It might give you an idea of how to lay it out. I found this by searching yahoo, source below.
DixbTv9oaa	Yes, its my favorite. I use it everyday.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	I haven't tried the gel, but that yellow dramatically different moisturizing lotion that they stick in all the free gift packages makes my skin very, very greasy.|`|MpqIrZJNaa	the moisturizer? The yellow on?  I LOVE IT! I use it everyday/eveynight  It doesn't make my skin oily (and I have oily skin)  I'm on my 3rd bottle. LOL
tj6kFnYWaa	you should try this out, every Morning, use a natural cleanser  every night you should use a natural night cream or body lotion,  and every time you bathe, you should use a natural bubble bath!   i think its good cause i do this every day ( but i use more! ) and i made sure that it was all under $15 , also if it would be really cheap, it would probably be less quality and bad for your skin, right?|`|CjW9fiSHaa	i had a good routine  and everything can be found in rite aid for $5 each. first i used st. ives apricot scrub. then i used Clearasil wipes, then i used biore face lotion then clean and clear spot treatment. it only took like five min. also, i loooooove the biore self-heating face masks. they are fabulous. they heat up instantly. but you don't need those. just use the above products twice a day. hope i helped!
cUuUWbrqaa	So the pink one has a smaller iron in the center, the blue one in 1 1/4 in and the pink is 1 inch. the pink onee would probably be better if you where looking to curl you hair with the flattening iron too. the pink one is a little more money too. i know people who have the pink one and it works very well. so yes:]|`|alRLh7yxaa	nothing really, just the widths. The pink is just a limited edition. The original is better|`|6QGa33pAaa	the second one is skinnier than the first.  the first is 1 1/4 inch while the second is 1 inch.|`|kOkrwUmgaa	they are different widths. the first is 1 and 1/4 inch and the second is one inch. not  that a quarter of an inch makes a big difference.
8bd93cde18c050d32e7dd633746b961aaa	None...lol|`|wWdQSuCbaa	Nothing. Nothing at all.|`|6QGa33pAaa	why does it matter?|`|piTonkZiaa	it depends on the girl thats judging i think tight jeans are hot like in this pic his outfit is hot    http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a256/I...|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	well to be honest, nobody notices what guys wear, like details. But we do notice if you just wear ONE color. I have a friend that only wears black, and it's obnoxious. I like color, and i LOVE long sleeves on guys.|`|7ForzFPdaa	hollister and abercrombie stuff is hot,(most of the time) and like the destressed jeans and stuff, thats really hot, and like most girls hate it when guys wear their pants lower than their boxers....but thats just me (:|`|5exZ6VIoaa	eh...    I like the skater/emoish style :D    Like skinny jeans and hats...Band tees, :P|`|FFq37ZgXaa	I like a boy that does own a pair of skinny jeans.  And clean clothes...|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Personally I like a guy that doesn't try too hard in terms of clothes.  Good hygiene is important though.
AVzQs5Uhaa	i shop there because i want too, there clothes hold up a lot longer then a lot of brands that i have experienced and there clothes and fabric are actually comfortable and soft. Also everyone has different taste not all of us want to wear the newest latest fashions coming out that are just gonna go out of style with in the next couple months or year  at least most of there things are more of a classic style that don't go out of fashion as quick as all the trends do. Here's an example for you I'm 22 and I still have a shirt from abercrombie that i got in high school and wore all thru out high school and still wear , how many people can say that  something that they bough for cheap can last that long, I haven't seen that happen anywhere. So does it bother you so bad some of  us might not like the style that you have or like or the brands that you like its diversity people where what they want to wear because they want to wear it and they like it because it fits there taste.|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	i work at hollister!! and i love their clothes i think it's cute!! plus it's the whole point why we're buying it, it's because of the brand. the brand proves the quality of the clothes.|`|Igyp0mB1aa	I shop there because I want to.|`|2Cv4xWsCaa	Well people think when they are paying more for an item they are getting something more exotic and rare when the reality is as you say everything is the same over and over and the point of paying $20 more for something seems a bit absurd, maybe some day we will all realize this.|`|nd6r6nOvaa	Go shag a rock and live in a hole, If we want to shop there then leave us be.Its our money were wasting.|`|jTaOTACiaa	why do you care?  i don't shop there because it isn't my style but it doesn't affect me in the least if someone else shops there..  seriously, who cares?|`|5T3NdHvyaa	I shop there because I think the clothes are cute. I love Hollister jeans because I'm really small and skinny and they have the only jeans that fit me well there. Sure, I could go to the kid's section at JCPenny's, but all their jeans have butterflies and stupid kid designs on them, which I would NEVER wear. So, I like Hollister & I shop there because it fits me nicely.    I personally think you're just jealous of the stores, no offence.|`|MM71EOH6aa	This is what you don't understand these people create Hollister, etc because they understand these teenagers are willing to buy these clothes, even if it's for that little tiny logo that is the size of a nail and even if they're expensive if it's "in" they will pay the extra.  Atleast you can say, I wear hollister, just for that purpose. And people want buisness these people aren't stupid they know teenagers will buy it and that's why they do it. From the buisness perspective it doesn't matter what makes money as long as it makes a lot of it, they're happy.  The quality of clothes feel very different trust me.|`|MTjyPMzHaa	I think their outfits are cute!!|`|R6Z8onywaa	i know they are pretty gross. why do you want to look like the person you're next to... seriously, i wear nordstrom, bergdorfs, urban outfitters... theyre all nice, and they carry so much different stuff. and you never look like your neighbor.|`|dfTMaV58aa	because i like the style of them... but i hate when people try to wear it to stroke they ego and go around acting like they are the stuff.

1bRRODd2aa	For day wear and subtle makeup, use Taupe, this is a good "day" colour for you.  For evening/party makeup, use brighter colours, such as a mid blue, lilac or mid green.  If you wear brown mascara rather than black, this will complement your colouring.|`|2e16f4a446bcc1c4a776329047757ddbaa	maybe purple or green?|`|GLEGh4N0aa	ive got grey eyes too mine are a little bit blue tho :p  try purple i always wear purple! :)|`|hEAuWYYjaa	you should have green or blue because you can pull off a bright color|`|SVeNYtReaa	a light frosty blue would work like a sparkly blue|`|QF5aBEGmaa	hi you can try this one:    beauty-tips4you.blogspot.com|`|WkSIlV3oaa	try a light blue or like oceon colours like light purple or green|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	You have GREY eyes? that's sick.

Freakkky|`|0zxiLWdcaa	Ooh you have grey eyes? You're lucky because you can wear any color, grey is neutral. Well, except grey eyeshadow. If you wear grey eyeshadow it'll create a flat base and won't make your eyes pop.

kCdISEGqaa	It's not a matter of infection form the ink, it's from someone doing a tattoo without proper sterilization.  Calligraphy ink will look bad under your skin, and will fade and look old fast.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	Calligraphy ink will not last like tattoo inks. They are made from a powder based pigment (at least the good inks are) where as the calligraphy type ink is all chemical base. Also, most of this type of ink is not water soluble. If the ink is not water soluble you are most assuredly going to have a reaction if not poisoning.    Using this kind of ink can rot the skin in that area which then can cause the infection to enter your blood stream... So, to end this, don't be 'stupid' and don't listen to 'stupid' people to tell you otherwise and I must say don't do it. If you weren't planning on doing it why even ask?
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	I barely felt it, the clamps were the worst part.    I sounded drunk for the first few days. You shouldn't have much trouble after a week or so.    I could eat right away    The swelling is a pain in the butt, not too sore.    Get your piercer to change it after 2 weeks.    Guide to tongue piercings:  http://www.articlefit.com/Tongue-Piercin...|`|K9Bcqloqaa	I got my tongue pierced for my b-day.  It took 2 weeks before I could talk properly.  I tried to be "understandable" but you have to understand that your tongue is swollen.  So it's not going to be easy to talk with a tongue that is bigger than normal. You sound kinda babyish.  It's hard to explain, but you will remember it forever:) It takes patience on your part.  In about 2 weeks I was able to eat, before than, smoothies, ice cream and soup.  It did hurt, but if you don't talk too much, and try not to eat the solid stuff, and clean it, it will hurt less and heal faster.  I changed it out myself finally about 2 months later because I was nervous about it.  But within a month you could probably change it out.|`|yPMPx78waa	I havent had my tongue pierced but many of my friends have and they said it didnt actually hurt that much but afterwards your tongue may swell and for the new few days you will not be able to eat or talk properly. But within a week it should have settled down and you should be back to normal(:|`|WNPGVpQWaa	Ok I'll be honest, the tongue piercing does hurt a bit but nothing that is going to make you pass out from the pain (it's a piercing of course it's going to hurt a little)  1. It took me about a week to get my speech back to normal, it was hard to say my s and t.  2. Yes people can understand you, you just sound like you have a lisp.  3. I would suggest eating before you get it pierced b/c it's hard to chew foods for the next few days b/c your tongue is swollen, I would go and buy a bunch of soft foods to eat the next couple days, yogurt, baby food, shakes etc.  4. I personally thought the swelling hurt more than the actual piercing!  5. You can change the jewelry a couple of weeks after you get your tongue pierced and you can do it yourself!|`|rzZXJz0qaa	I could talk just fine..   depends on how your body takes it, it gets swollen and a friend of mine couldnt talk at all. So it just depends on the person  I was able after 3 days to eat.  It hurts I wont lie. Eat lots of ice chips for swelling.   I changed mine after 3 months I can do myself, if you are scared go back they can do it for you for free.
fhxLlAd6aa	to be original what about andy warhol pop art?
WBTQAhbbaa	you should get it layered at the top and maybe extensions at the botom. if your against fake hair you should not get any length cut off but just "razor" (layer) the top. your hair will be pretty short but about the same as it is now,it will be more managable than it is now.    I hope I helped!!!   Good luck on the hair.   BYE!|`|hAjLUKGRaa	honestly if you ABSOLUTELY hate it  ......in my opinion you should have it all cut to about the same layer BUT if that is way tooooo short for your likin which i'm guessin it would be since you said that you have medium length hair, and i would kill myself before i cut my hair really short!! i would just have it evened out maybe thinned at the top to match the bottom (just tell the lady to razor it at the top to even out) then all you have to do is just wait, wait, and KEEP WAITING lol been there done that =) naturally blonde hair is really pretty to start with so i wouldnt worry bout it too much!! friends usually lie when you ask for their honest opinion about hair so you were really smart to ask it on here =) best of luck!!!|`|I3W8Yt5gaa	shoulder cut looks really good with a side part then clipped to the side  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...  ^  I  I_______these will look good|`|2RzOqHObaa	go to www.myspace.com/codydcshoes|`|fg89JwZGaa	I'd say go to a reliable hairstylist. If you recently had this cut and/or it was already like this when first cut, go to a different person. Get it relayered. I think layers are the best :]    If its poofy, try showering at night and airdry it. When its basically completely dry, go to sleep and it shouldnt have that "mushroom" look to it. Good luck! :]|`|SRT5rMSHaa	well don't cut it you cut put it in a high ponytail until it grows out|`|hEAuWYYjaa	maybe you should have a short bob or pixie cut because they are adorible
z98aPYQqaa	Yeah it should, but you might want to add some different colours to the outfit with accessories or shoes.  Hope i helped :)|`|R6Z8onywaa	no the dress is too bulbous for a long cardigan. and black on black??? i think a black cardigan and a straight bring colored dress would be nice with a pair of black gladiators|`|vWKQJhwRaa	ya, i guess...  u shud wear flats with it!!   :D|`|m01ijLFUaa	You could wear it with:  Colourful belt  Same colour jacket  Black Tights  Black boots/pumps  And something colourful in your hair ?    And yes it would go with a long black cardi - only it might be v. v. black ! if you want to, you can get them in New Look btw :D|`|WqMHYfPfaa	It depends on what the cardigan looks like. LOL!|`|Byty65f0aa	no no no.  if the dress is a bubble dress the cardigan will just hang off the bum and make it look absolutely massive . i'd go with a pale gray cardi, because the black is just overpowering, too much off it. and, wear the cardi to your hips.|`|z0Wkh9hDaa	I don't think you should put the black with black, maybe a vibrant bold colour and then have cute pumps of a similar colour to the cardigan!  :)|`|xrsAGqb7aa	yes very well|`|HXLg3nbDaa	i work at topshop and tbh i wouldnt wear a black cardi, only because you wouldnt stand out, go for something vibrant and exciting, also if its cassual wear it with flats|`|c3b11df445c85a57854c19a1ff159cddaa	homg yes!!!  umm pixie boots with leggings?  or just flats or pumps  it looks great!|`|VWMbWU5Zaa	the black dress is lovely (:  erm, i think you should go for a vibrant coloured cardi with short sleeves and short length, instead of long black cardi.  wear black pumps with them too  :D|`|fagMeWXHaa	a cardigan yes but not black, a bright colour to bring some life to the outfit, any bright colours, blue, pink, green, white maybe.    as for shoes...    http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    hope i could help|`|QeInCI4Raa	Not a black cardigan  try a brightly colored one.  Maybe some cute colored sandals or flats|`|vPyECH00aa	No Absolutely not!    Instead a short cropped tie front light sweater.    A light cream color for a formal look or a real bright for a fun look.    Keep to flats - cute and bright or a bronze or silver metallic with the cream top!
efQGWAoMaa	Colour popping seems to be appearing in all the fashion mags and on the red carpet too!

Greys are also very popular at the moment :)|`|EgbIYBehaa	Well, Chloe has set the trend for Pastel colours, matched with pastel head ties, think bananarama, also, Christopher Kane has also took this trend on, and Topshop Unique, Coral, Powder Blue, Turqoise, Light Pink and light Grey are all going to big!|`|MhpCLLKWaa	right know neon color with dead color (beige, gray...) are so in, u put them together and it will look so well|`|SVeNYtReaa	choose red or pink because they are valentines day colors and spring colors|`|qrOuQudZaa	Well, it's going to be spring, so think pastels.

eytlIKITaa	Dude- are you out of your mind!?  Kurt's hair was like a dirty blond- it got lighter and darker- He didn't flippin dye it!  The only time he dyed his hair was when it was pink- learn your sh!t.    Yeah, used to worship Kurt too!  : )|`|teOLv3h1aa	he was blonde and he used kool aid.    trust me I used to worship Kurt Cobain.    Kurt didn't have a hair stylist, and he didn't bleach his hair.     he just put kool-aid in his naturally blonde hair.    looks pretty blonde to me \/\/\/\/\/  http://www.nirvanafreak.net/pics/front1....|`|79L0T9bIaa	I don't think you can Kool-Aid your hair blond..it isn't possible.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	How in the hell would you get blonde hair from kool aid... yeah... bleach it...|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	Kool-aid won't do anything to your hair except maybe make it purple. (or blue depending on the flavor)  You might try something like sun in or, considering he had quite a bit of money, go to a salon.|`|r782jijgaa	Kool-Aid will not make your hair lighter.  You can try lemon juice.  Depending on how dark your hair is once you put lemon juice on it and get in the some it helps naturally lighten it.|`|LtlXSL51aa	ok   1 kool aid is not hair color and would never make your hair blonde from brown.    2 more then likely Kurt  had a professional stylist doing his hair at his every beck and call.....meaning he had a personal hairstylist with him 24 7 .   So with that said....you need to go to a salon and have a consult. Most of the time they do not charge you. Get a professional in your area to explain to you about the process.  its more detailed then Im sure you realize.  good luck:)
aJFVCGOgaa	Smile :D   and the part that goes up you put the blush on do a stroke down each cheek with a big soft brush,idfferent to your foundation one but don't over do it otherwise you look OTT.  x|`|OFNmZbPCaa	smooth strokes UP your cheek bone.|`|VgXwkFWraa	How I do my blush is first put on a little bit of foundation to even out my skin color. Then I use cream/gel blush I squirt out a lil tiny dot on my finger. I smile so I can clearly see the apples of my cheeks then take that small dot and dab it on the the apple in three dots. Then I use my finger to blend it up towards my temples. Then I take powder blush an go over the apples of my cheeks to even out the cream/gel blush (so I don't have what i call clown cheeks). I take some white powder on a powder puff to set the blush I applied. Finally I take highlighter and squirt a small dot onto my finger and dab it along the line of my cheeks. then blend to give a nice glow.|`|hJagdJIQaa	Get a big round brush and swipe it with blush. Dab it on your wrist to warm it up and then apply to the apples of your cheeks (the part that pops when your smile) You can put some on your temples, too. Make sure its the right shade too. If you have fair skin, get a coral color. If you have dark skin get a rosy, deep color.|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	I usually just suck in my cheeks to look like a fish, and apply it right there.
AA11318212	I teach personality development to college students and part of the discussion, this always comes up:<br>  <br>  Here are the basics:<br>  <br>  Come on time. Don't be late. Coming on time shows that you are serious about getting the job and shows a professional side of you.<br>  <br>  Always be polite and answer questions truthfully and honestly.<br>  <br>  Be sure to wear deodorant during the interview. Some people who don't really sweat a lot, tend to sweat during interviews. This is called nervous tension. You don't want to be worried about wet armpits on days like this.<br>  <br>  Wear closed toe shoes, avoid open toe shoes.<br>  <br>  Stay off loud make-up and bright colorful nail polish (like reds, blues, black, sparkle) Use clear nailpolish or go french tips if you must wear nail polish.<br>  <br>  For clothes, wear something that speaks of you as a professional, even if you are just applying as a store clerk or a stockroom staff member. Sometimes, due to your credentials and capabilities, they MIGHT offer you a position higher to the one to your are actually applying for. <br>  <br>  Safe clothes: Slacks, clean collared shirt, closed toe shoes.<br>  or<br>  Decent top, with a skirt that falls just below your knees, close toe shoes,<br>  <br>  Avoid: spaghetti tops, tubes, see-thru blouses, deep or low neck lines, over sized accessories. Stay off loud colors.<br>  <br>  Suggestion: Twin set top (the knit kind tank top with a matching cardigan), slacks and low pumps, with pearl studs is okay.<br>  <br>  For make-up: clean look. Stay sheer blush, lip balm or a lipstick shade closest you your natural skin color, wear a light foundation, about two coats of mascara and neutral shades of eyeshadow if you must. Stay off loud colors, bright reds.<br>  <br>  For hair, I usually wear mine in a neat bun or a pony tail. Just keep it away from your face so you wont have to brush it away from your face during the interview. <br>  <br>  When you go into for an interview, remember to greet the person, ask if you may have a seat. Do not sit down unless he tell you to or if you have asked if you may be seated.<br>  <br>  Answer all questions and make sure you know what you have written on your application form and resume. Be sure to bring a copy of your resume, just in case.<br>  <br>  Don't pretend to know an answer to the question if you really don't know it.<br>  <br>  Avoid fidgeting during the interview. Place hands on your lap.<br>  <br>  Don't play with your hair, pick your nose, text or answer your cell phone.<br>  <br>  Remember to turn your phone off or place it on silent mode before you walk in.<br>  <br>  Always remember to thank the interviewer for his/her time. <br>  <br>  Dont be pushy.  <br>  <br>  Its alright to ask questions that are job-related but do research about the company BEFORE going in for the interview. Do not ask personal questions or for the personal numbers, wait for them to give you their business card.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	Wear what the employees are wearing who are doing a job similar to the job you want — only neater and nicer if possible.<br>  <br>  To my mind, this would be clean, well-pressed dark slacks instead of jeans, dark shoes (not heels) instead of big white athletic sneakers, and a long-sleeved woven fabric shirt instead of a snug-fitting knit top.  I notice that Target employees who work in customer areas all wear red shirts, and some of those shirts look like ones the employees already own.  You can ask about the store's dress code during the interview.<br>  <br>  Remove any studs and other piercing metal, except perhaps one small earring in each ear.  Don't wear any scented products at all.<br>  <br>  Wear your hair in a neat, brushed-back style.  Your job will probably be physically active, so long hair that could get caught on things or that falls in your face all the time would be a negative.<br>  <br>  Wait to sit down until the interviewer invites you to be seated.  He or she will offer a hand to shake.  Have two or three copies of your resumé with you.  Since this will be your first job, it should probably just show your name, address, and telephone, your high school, with any advanced courses you've taken plus one or two clubs and sports, if any.  If you've done baby-sitting, housework, or lawn care for anybody, ask them ahead of time if they'd be willing to give you a reference if asked.  Teachers are generally too busy to be available to give references, but you can ask.  You can either list the names and telephone numbers of your references on your resumé, or put "References furnished on request".  At the end of the interview, be sure to thank the interviewer for seeing you.<br>  <br>  A confident attitude, one that conveys the idea that you will be a conscientious and reliable worker, will be a positive!  Best of luck!|`|Z4ek79ZCaa	Dress similarly to the uniform. Be outgoing, act as if you already have the job. Ask them questions, as if you have several oppurtunities. Once you get a job, keep applying since you have nothing to lose but you could always improve pay/benefits/quality of employment.

I dont personally like it.  I think you could do something much more creative and imaginative that is personal to you.  Good Luck!|`|Jbg4jsZzaa	you shoud put them purple and with a real lite pink|`|6kxWMPEQaa	The important thing is that you LOVE it since it is going on your body for life.  I would suggest trying to make it a little more personal, like adding something to it that has a special meaning to you, such as music notes for someone who loves music, etc.  I mean yeah it is cute but will "cute" work for you when your 50?  Or will something with a meaning behind it work better.  Like you said, your not in a hurry, so put some more thought into it.      Remember you don't have to come up the the exact picture you want.  You can come up with ideas and random pictures and work with your artist on creating something that fits you and will be a one of the kind.     Good Luck!

But wash it so often and have it treated occasionally (at least 2-3 times a year).<br>  First, go to your stylist and ask him/her to have the ends fixed. What I mean is have just the tips trimmed. You might just have split ends which causes the hair to look limp.<br>  If after that it still doesn't seem to get back into life, opt for a hot oil or hair spa treatment. Massaging from the roots helps the hair and the scalp as well.<br>  Don't forget to use a good conditioner every time you shampoo. but try different conditioners. Sometimes, your hair gets so used to a certain brand, it no longer works. I change brands every now and them (usually every 5-6 weeks).<br>  If you can, let your hair dry normally. (If I can't wait, I go infront of a span, and let it dry. But on a low speed).<br>  If by after doing all of these tips, you still don't get the desired effect, look or body you want on your hair, go to your stylist and ask for a new style, but maintaining the length you are comfortable with that matches your lifestyle as well. (if you are into sports and extra curricular activities, go for a hair style that still allows you to put your hair up, get the idea?)|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	God DAMMIT that is one awful picture!!<br>  <br>  At the very least, get rid of the "fringe". Just have normal hair. Maybe straighten it, and wear it down. Don't do any goofy styles or anything. You'll look pretty attractive if you went with something that doesn't scream "I HAVE NO PERSONALITY OF MY OWN SO I HAVE TO COPY WHAT I SEE ON MYSPACE!!!" Keep it cute and simple, not wild and extravagant.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to be rude, but that's my suggestion.|`|ICX0RTsuaa	you have lovely hair.<br>  i agree. a side fringe.<br>  and you should try stuff with it, like loose curls, its quite quick and easy, and keeping it well maintained, like soft and smooth. the colour suits you. try tying it up with some nice accessories, or just a nice head band.<br>  x|`|4ykO2wj9aa	Layer it and Give yourself some bangs.

XQIbx7Plaa	Here is a picture of my hair: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=42...  I am the one sticking out my tongue.  It was taken last year when I was pregnant.    What I do is towel dry my hair, once I am done showering.   brush through it,   then use lots of gel throughout making sure that all of the hair is covered. you can use mouse but it typically has alcohol in it, which dries hair out, and I am sure that you know with curly hair we already have that problem, no need to make it worse.  Gel works great, I use any brand that has a decent price...  I use any blowdryer with a diffuser (the diffuser is key to the whole process!)   I typically start blowdrying upside down, working my way all around,  then once it is a little dryer I spray it with hair spray, it works really well to hold the curl.  I proceed to dry it until it is COMPLETELY dry.  If it isn't completely dry then it will weigh down the curl and they won't be as defined... but it all depends on what you are looking for.  once it is dry I typically use a few bobby pins to pin some of the roots in place, it helps to control some of the curls that have minds of their own!    I know what it is like to have to work hard to get the curls perfect and I have learned a lot through trial and error and this seems to work the best.  It is really efficient and it is quick.  I get compliments often probably because it looks 'different' than the typical hairstyle.    hope that helps!|`|AA10408984	I know exactly how you feel! I stopped blow drying my hair a few years ago completely. What I do now is I take my showers at night, put on hair mousse and then go to bed. I put a towel on my pillow so that it doesn't get wet and I also sleep with my hair like it looks in this photo (the photo isn't mine I just found it on the internet so that I can describe the way I let my hair dry to you):    http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2144/2215...    I get those gorgeous curls in the morning cause they dry themselves!     Or you could get a perm curler for your blow dryer if you don't wanna go to bed with wet hair. Like this:    http://www.global-b2b-network.com/direct...    I hope this helps!
lU8e0VQFaa	I would say it's probably safe but I doubt it would do you any good.     I would just experiment with products that you can buy here in a store, or there is a Filipino product that I ADORE, it's called Likas Papaya soap, it's herbal and organic and I've never had my skin feel this soft in my life (plus I'm on Accutane and was having serious dry skin problems til I started using this a couple of weeks ago). I got mine off ebay for $10.50 (including shipping) for 2 bars. But this stuff is so good there are actually counterfeits out there, make sure the box has a hologram all over it.|`|X9iZA9svaa	not sure|`|IIpEaDCcaa	I wouldn't try it..    stick to vitamins, and your normal face wash.

JdpVNgyxaa	Obviously the usual black, grey, white, cream will work well.    A deep indigo blue will look gorgeous.    Stay away from bright colours, try to get something the same darkness.

YEd9Q5KZaa	Two people could go in pretty much any store and come out looking completely different. I personally hate Hollister.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I think they are overpriced.|`|wobcLteyaa	no|`|mOZfR8yhaa	hollister is awesome.period.|`|spSKaJHaaa	i think it is kinna like being a clone in a way .. i love hollister though and i think if you do where it in your own way .. and yes logo tees are not the way to go ! hehe|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	i totally agree!! i work there and i know we few of us who work there have the same top or shirt but we create our own look to make it more interesting.|`|2InNn09eaa	=]YES!... but i still wear it-|`|oLtcvloxaa	no because if you go in that store, everything looks the same but in different colors. try it its weird.|`|9lTJhYYAaa	yes.|`|C4bB27wwaa	I dont think its unoriginal but most likely its going to be very similar to the way other poeple are wearing it but your right some people style it differently and make it look unique i think it just depends on how you style yourself.  I agree when you say if your just wearing the shirts with the logo its pretty orignal and boring but accesories and stuff make it look cute.|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	I think its very unoringial. people only buy it to be like everyone else. all they sell there are jeans that dont fit anyone but people size 00. and shirts that say HOLLISTER. how exciting is that?|`|3sluAsazaa	you can be unoriginal if you shop at hollister but you are definitely not in style. Their stuff is all the same year after year. The classic button up or v-neck....Things from other stores such as forever 21 and h&m are much more classy, cheaper, and better quality.|`|vcNOuvPNaa	Yes,to an extent     Real clothes to me are ones that follow the trends like in magazines and stuff.     Hollister has just plain t-shirts either saying the logo or like just the small seagull crest in the top or bottom corner. They have the exact same colour scheme, everything almost looks the same. When your walking down the street you can easily point out whos wearing hollister ( if the logo isnt across their chest) because their clothes are so predictable. Same with their jeans- their either destroyed or plain. Rather than highwaisted, wide leg, trouser jeans ...etc)    In the real fashion world there are trends , and you can either follow them, or not. You need to be courageous and outgoing, someone that can pull daring outfits things off.    Highwaisted skirts/pants were in, and probably still are, hollister had none of those.    Black was in several times- hollister has nothing black    Animal prints neon prints etc.. none of that they stick to their own colours..      I'm not saying everyone should follow the fashion trends but being original is mainly you either find our ownn style or find things you wouldnt see people wear often , and thats practically what fashion designers do.    Hollister isnt original thats for sure but you could still pick out a few pieces like their shirts or the sweaters and pair it up with an original piece.|`|RbsV1JvSaa	theyre the definition of unoriginality. theyre overpriced and there as unoriginal and conformist as u can get.

2Dy6jZBtaa	...r u kidding? u can always loose weight. u need to eat right and healthy and exercise... that is basically the way to loose the pounds and shape up...u wont be able to have the ideal body that u have in ur head like u see in magazines necessarily because u have ur own body type...ur body type may not match the person's body u have as an ideal no matter how much weight u loose...so its best to just aim to be healthy rather than stick thin...the less stressed u are when loosing weight the easier it will come off...eating healthy doesn't mean starving urself. it means eating just as much as u do now in terms of amounts nad portion sizes, just in a healthier manor...such as for pizza substitute with an at home thin crust whole wheat pizza crust u can bake, top with spinach, olive oil, Parmesan, and a low fat tasty meat called prosciutto di parma it tastes just as strong as peperoni and its only half the cals..top with 4 eggs if u want as it is pretty darn yummie of i do say so myself...where a fourth of that pizza is only 385 cals...meaning u can eat just as much portion wise of a fourth the pizza and eat what u should eat in calories per serving instead of the 600 plus u get from a pizza u order...see what i mean by healthy? hehe..there are yummie ways of eating healthy and just as much to make u full and still loose weight. exercise 40 minutes to an hour a day, make 3/4 of that cardio (running, jogging,stair stepping, bicycling, walking) and the rest stretching and strengthing such as pilates and lifting and ul be there in no time...u wont bulk up like a man does  and gain huge msucle from lifting and doing weight training exercise i promise...that take a lot of effort and a lot of time to even get that close to getting manly characteristics in ur body...there are book with healthy recepies at bookstores. u basically want a 350-450 cal per meal, 350 for one or two if u want desert, like a cookie or a scoop of yogurt ice cream ...meaning u wanna get at least 1200 cals to keep ur self healthy...the girl from the hills, LC said she has a 1500 cal diet to stay the way she is with exercise for an hour...just to give u an idea that u really dont needa starve or work too hard to where u have no more energy for the day.|`|AcPq4Qd8aa	I dont know if it is possible to loose weight!

(jogging) (power walking)<br>  3. skip dinner in that time you can eat fruits. skipping dinner is the most easiest way to get your tummy flattened, but eat fruits like i mentioned don't struggle yourself.<br>  4. Stop eating junk food, chocolates, and soft drinks.<br>  5. sleep at least 8 hours.<br>  <br>  <br>  Those 5 steps are the way to healthy body.<br>  Please follow them, very easy. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped you.<br>  Good luck.|`|S9tFYTdNaa	Good news for ya......YES IT IS POSSIBLE... :)<br>  <br>  i feel there are only 2 ways to get in good shape<br>  1. Proper Diet<br>  2. Proper Exercise<br>  <br>  And u need to be patient while in the process of loosing weight..<br>  never give up....
UByvC54Xaa	its between 20 - 40%. I know that is a huge a range but it is based on several factors. The thickness of the dreads, the thickness of your hair, the texture and whether it is straight or curly. Curly hair will lose more length than straight hair and thin hair will lose more length than thick hair. <br>  <br>  I guess it also depends on what technique you use for dreading. Even then, some people backcomb more loosely than others.<br>  <br>  So yeah I guess that explains the big jump between 20 - 40%. You have to see how you go for yourself. Also keep in mind - your hair dreads will continue to shorten and shrink over the first few weeks as they "tighten".

I prefer hairspray, or else there are special curling products you can buy.|`|bRcwqYhiaa	i think moose it then bit of hairspray all over, if ur hair is str8 i find crinkling it helps for the curls to stay in for longer so crinklin your hair all over comb it out so it looks kind of ruff then use the curler, your curls would last longer. x
Yp15y9zRaa	You shouldn't use that sort of cream on a tattoo until a bit later on when it's pretty much totally healed. Get some nappy rash cream like sudocrem or bepanthen, you don't need to spend loads on silly 'specialist' tattoo cream. <br>  <br>  A thick layer of nappy rash cream will take care of the cracking and will allow the tatttoo to heal properly. I wouldn't worry too much about it being on your sheets, that is probably just excess ink coming off. <br>  <br>  Where is your tattoo? The placement is important for the care, the one on my foot needed to be kept covered, with a change of cover every 4 hours plus a fresh application of sudocrem. I had to do this for 3 days. Other tattoos need to be left uncovered so consider this as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  **edit** in response to Nicci, I think different artists advise differently. My tattoo was covered with a thick layer of nappy rash cream as my tattoist advised that often foot tattoos can dry out and crack, and so can need covering to keep them mousturised. It worked well though :) It's quite a large tattoo on my foot so maybe that's why? xx|`|Cavz3kAPaa	The ink has probably just leaked onto your sheets. Normal for a new tattoo. Some places to recommend nappy rash cream, so you are probably safe to do that.<br>  <br>  I'm surprise that the person who posted about the foot tattoo was told to cover theirs, as it's normally common practice not to re bandage tattoos as they need to breathe. I have also had a foot tattoo, and one on my thigh, and I found that when I covered my tattoos on the second day, the bandages got caught, and if your not careful can pull colour.<br>  <br>  Call your studio and ask if that cream is alright to use. You shouldn't let your tattoo dry out, but you must not over moisturize it either.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

g3IXprk9aa	I think a monroe piercing would look adorable on you, you would look good with a septum piercing too.

v1uNUcwCaa	￡85 for a small tat??? just how big is the tat? <br>  have you asked around for prices or just gone to the first tattooist you saw? i think that you should maybe check out some other studios for the price.<br>  a good tat studio is very clean and they bin their needles after every use<br>  so the needles they use for you will be brand new. when i had my tats done i saw the needles come out of the packets so i knew they were clean.<br>  you should buy some E45 cream or savlon to help your tattoo heal<br>  a good tattooist will advise you how to look after your tat maybe even give you a leflet with advise on it. <br>  <br>  usually with tats the nearer to the bone it is the more it hurts. but the adrenaline will help ease the pain.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Your hip may be a little painful. I've noticed when getting tattoos that when the needle hits the bone I experience slight pain and since your hip is pretty boney you will feel some pain depending on your tolerance. I tell people its more a irritating feeling than anything else, but Im also pretty impatient.<br>  Make sure you go to a place that is certified and has a sanitizing machine, ask to see it, if they dont have one..RUN! All equipment should be taken out of the package for you too see and to avoid infections make sure you follow up with the artists orders. For the first few months you need to follow a variety of steps for your tattoo to have the best outcome. Your parlor should also be approved by the red-cross!|`|A2M6sAklaa	am not going to lie,it does hurt but its a bearable pain,ive got 4 tattoos,one on my back that cost me 400 pounds.. love them|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	I'd be more concerned about looking like a little tart.|`|UNsQC0DGaa	I dont know in your area but some places if you have parents consent and they go with you , you can have one under 18 years. IMO if you need a fake id to do something than you probably shouldn't be doing it because that can get alot of people in alot of trouble including the tat parlor. <br>  Tat's can hurt they are jabbing needles into you, but it is all in how your body can tolerate the pain and your mind set when having it done. Also you should always make sure that they open the needle in front of you and that the place you are having it done is a clean sterile environment.<br>  have you thought about the consequences if they realize that it is a fake id or if you do end up with an infection and have to explain it to your parents anyway? Just wondering. I have tat's and love mine I just think that if you have to sneak behind your parents back with a fake id maybe it is something that you should reconsider, maybe you could talk to your parents about they maybe more open minded than what you think and can help you find a safe clean place at a price that works for you to have it done|`|kGpgpgKeaa	Regardless of looking 18 and having fake ID, if someone finds out how old you really are and goes to the authorities about you getting tattooed, you could get your tattooist into a hell of a lot of trouble. He could lose his studio, get a hefty fine, be prosecuted for assault on a minor, put on the sex offenders register among other things depending on the circumstances. Grow up and wait until you are old enough to be tattooed. Its unfair on your artist, and selfish of you to fool him into doing this work on you.<br>  When I was tattooing I refused to accept any form of ID except a passport as this is the most difficult form of ID to forge.|`|f42b59297654b7eb6918a980d6b6cf64aa	What you should be aware of is yes it does hurt and if you are in the UK it is illegal for them to do a tattoo on you under the age of 18!<br>  <br>  How old do I need to be to get a tattoo or body piercing?<br>  <br>  We will not tattoo anyone under the age of 18 under any circumstances. <br>  <br>  Although the legal age of consent for a tattoo is 18 years there is currently no legally set age for body piercing. However, we will insist on a minimum age of 16 without parental consent. There is a minimum age of 18 for nipple and genital piercing. <br>  <br>  ID IS ALWAYS REQUIRED<br>  (taken from tattoocrazy.co.uk)|`|hLNieq8xaa	Everyone has a different pain tollerance level.. So its hard to say how much it will hurt for you.. <br>  <br>  Just remember, the more bone there is the more it will hurt. <br>  <br>  The main worry about getting a tattoo is if you will end up regreting it in a few years time.|`|e8b38297d9e56a30610db6c938b6aa2faa	What you need to worry about is that you feel the need to mutilate yourself for the rest of your life just to set yourself apart from other people in a very conformist way.<br>  <br>  Get real - don't get a tattoo.|`|HWkWL90Faa	they should show you the needle being taken out of the sterile package. i was 16 for my first tattoo, and they showed me everything. on the hip, is more uncomfortable than other places but its wont be like you cant stand it|`|k56mmj2eaa	you do not know that the needles are clean. so your taking your chances there. dose it hurt I say yes it dose. unless you have a high pain tolerance.|`|B3Sree53aa	the person above is right everyone has a different pain tolerance. for me it just felt like my skin was burning. I thought it was tolerable.|`|8S4I53DBaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that ￡85 is expensive for a tattoo.<br>  <br>  I presume you have been recommended to this place by somebody and didn't just walk in off the street? I would make sure you are happy with the surroundings, things like new needles on display, certificates on the wall etc etc etc.<br>  <br>  I won't lie, it does hurt (a little) but you get used to it.<br>  <br>  As long as the equipment used is steralised then you shopuldnt have any problems with infections etc|`|tqf7ZhwEaa	"how do i know if they're being safe with the needles?"<br>  <br>  The needles should be individually wrapped, i believe.. Someone told me to ask the tattooist open a new needle in front of me when i got mine.|`|UE5BkXEbaa	I would worry about looking like a little tramp.|`|JVPt99Hxaa	you need to see if the needle has just came out of a packet so then you no that the needle is clean so you wont catch anything and make sure it dont get infected|`|CPxmHjx4aa	the main thing is not to move when the tattoo artist starts...<br>  they dont hurt as much as people think...<br>  i have two and the only thing i really felt was the outline and it was like just little sticks..the needle moves so fast that it will b over in no time..<br>  just make sure you follow their aftercare instructions..<br>  good luck

rqYy0RJVaa	Well babes, when they say "dry body brushing" they really mean "damp body  brushing". U need to get sum water on ur skin to soften the dead layers of ur skin cells 1st, this is the top horny (lol) layer that u wanna remove. If u brush ur body when its totally dry, then u will damage the skina s there is no lubrication. U can make ur own body scrub by mixing olive oil and brown sugar, or just use a flannel to scrub away dead skin. Then moisturise, rweally rub it in, dont 4get elbows as these can become all scabby and dry, and then wrap up in ur dressing gown and go watch soem Friends!!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, have a nice day hun, <br>  <br>  Susanna X

RV1LjkMmaa	Why DO they do that?  I've had it happen too - arghhhhh it is such a stupid thing to do!  The only thing you can do is have some fine low lights on the areas that have turned brassy.  Apart from that - it will surprisingly seem to sort it's self out.  Make sure you remember this for next time and mention it to the hairdresser every time you go so that they don't make this mistake again.  In future they will have to use a strength of peroxide that is high enough or leave it on long enough to take your highlights to the desired blonde without the need for the use of toner afterwards.  Go back to the hairdresser who did it, and get them to put the low lights in - they shouldn't charge you.  Don't put up with it if you're unhappy.  Good luck!|`|CDH5WVDbaa	Did they? Wow,  i thought the toner was meant to get RID of the brassiness/orange, thats what i get told!Perhaps they used a strawberry tinged toner. That is what my evil hairdresser did last time. To get rid of it, you can buy hair dyes that are pretty  much toners in the supermarket. Or, i think you should go in and say its not what you wanted and then they HAVE to fix it free of charge. Dont be scared, just explain it nicely and say you did not pay for it to be orange.<br>  <br>  Let us know if you do!

k4ULQrugaa	Since you bought the brush at Nordstrom, I would take advantage of their return policy and return it. Obviously you have some concerns about the brush you purchased. Let the Nordstrom employee know. You can either return the brush or do a simple exchange. It shouldn't be too hard. If you have any problems, just ask to speak to a manager and they will be happy to make sure you are satisfied.|`|6aEhPcDAaa	Yeah, it is possible, but VERY unlikely.  I don't think that it is likely that a legit MAC store would sell a fake MAC brush.  Its kind of like a Chanel store selling a fake Chanel bag.  Probably not going to happen.  An option is, maybe the site that you went on had the incorrect information of if its real or not.  If you are really worried about it, then go to the MAC store, and tell one of the MA'S (MAC artists) that you bought a brush there, and saw a description of fake MAC brushes online, and I was wondering if you could tell me if its real or not.  Something like that.  If its embarrassing to you, chances are, you probably will never see that MA again, and if you do then she probably won't remember about that weird MAC brush thing, lol.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|Yp15y9zRaa	It's very highly doubtful that a shop would be selling fake brushes.

AILK0BTiaa	because you don't love yourself unfortunately.. :o/|`|hccISKvHaa	It's because we are always more critical on ourselves, we notice our flaws more than anyone else looking at us|`|SweWwxDSaa	Probably 'cos you're 15. Everyone thinks they're ugly at that age. It's an awkward stage where you feel insecure and unsure of yourself. You're right between boy & man now and it's not easy with all the hormones and physical changes. Be confident. Don't compare yourself to others 'cos that'll get you down. Don't care about what others think. Just be yourself and you'll find a comfort zone. Women like guys who make them feel secure and in order to do that, you have to be secure with yourself.

7IjGzvqTaa	I'm gonna go ahead and say...no.<br>  <br>  You really will look like a clown.  It wouldn't be so bad if not for the whole "tucking the pants into the socks at the knees" thing.  The baggy pants would work with the tight top if they're kept at ankle length, but rolling them up to the knees defeats the purpose.<br>  <br>  Your friends love it because they love you.  It makes your teachers' days because you're different, and teachers like different.  To hear the truth, I would say do it even if it doesn't end up looking good, but make sure that you enjoy it.  That's what being a kid is all about; enjoying yourself.  Don't get stuck up in the fads, or setting the new trends or whatnot.<br>  <br>  AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, what happened to your grammar in that last paragraph?!  This was a perfectly acceptable question until you hit 'Additional Details,' and then it looks like it was written by another person!  "Friends" is not spelled with a "z," "teachers" is not spelled with a "z," "that's" is not spelled with a "z," "but" should for NO reason have an "h" in it, and numbers do not equal words when you spell out the other half!  You used the wrong form of "hear;" you used far too many ampersands (Hint: YOU ONLY NEED ONE AT A TIME), and for the love of CHEESE, learn to use punctuation PROPERLY.<br>  <br>  ...I'm sorry, I've been seeing a lot of terrible grammar on here tonight; yours just happened to be the question where I finally lost my mind.  Carry on.  And good luck with the fashion thing!|`|p8rxpA98aa	I guesss|`|h6AH6Biyaa	It would look to me as if you were trying too hard to be different.

They go well with bright, snug-fitting tops.  The cute socks would be visible whenever you move.

PRzmwFfgaa	That is not true what Crazy Banana Girl says.  If it is a true hair braiding expert then you can have very short hair and get your hair braided.  I used to have long hair and got my hair braided all the time.  I recently cut my hair so that it is only about 1 inch long all over and I didn't like it so I went and got it braided.  They did it with no problem.  As long as the person braiding your hair is an expert, you should be fine.  If someone's hair is all the way down to their shoulder, and a person can't braid it, then they have no business braiding hair.  Sorry.

When you walk into a room, hold your head up high, as 1st impressions last (as my dad used to say to me). You'll be suprised how many people are watching you when you are out (male and female). If you feel good you look good! X x|`|wFBJR9cgaa	first it depends on your skin tone and your body shape,for instance,if u are pair shaped you would look best in clothes that draw the eye away from the problem areas,like hips tummy nd bottem,big prints can look good and always accsserise with jewelery and bangles and bags to draw the eye,if u are pale dot wear too dark or too bright, never wear clothes that clash with your hair colour and try to match shoes  with the same bag colour and keep make up simple,illuminate your best feature with make up smokey eye shadows are great and never wear too many colours at the same time. and always remember the golden rule: if you have your legs on show,keep the top covered up and if you have a cleavage on show always cover your legs,if you dont do this you risk looking cheap! keep it classy!|`|lW62jIvuaa	You can look and feel great in 8 weeks.

keEwsjxYaa	it's residue from hair products you use that's sticking to the plates. really you should clean the plates every time before straightening your hair because the residue comes off onto your hair and that's unhygienic. <br>  <br>  to clean the plates (i'm assuming they're ceramic plates.. because they are the most common) make sure that they're not plugged in and that they'rcompletelyly cold. get a soft cloth or tissue make sure its dry and just wipe the plates applying some pressure if that doesn't work, dampen the cloth but then make sure there isn't any excess water and do this again.. if some comes off, keep wiping till all of it does.<br>  <br>  this should work, but if the residue is very stubborn, put a little bit of mild soap onto the cloth and try wiping. by this time, all your residue should have come off.<br>  <br>  this may take some time, so be patient and also don't try scratching the plates in an attempt to make this quicker because it wildestroyoy your straighteners.<br>  <br>  and from then on clean your straighteners every time before you use them because this stops residue building up.<br>  <br>  hopethiishelps x|`|fMPyLqW4aa	You need to slowly scrape them off or take a damp paper on top of it and scratch it.|`|gDCQAh6waa	This happened to my last straighteners and i had to get rid of them but with my new ones i just lightly scratch it off but because yours might be harder to get off I'm not sure. & i don't use hairspray or products on my hair and my straighteners still go like it.

The problem with these rubbish places that just pierce ears is that they make you sign an agreement before they pierce you,so if anything does go wrong they can't be blamed.|`|rOY2J0UAaa	i have heard that it can shatter your cartilage through sudden shock to the tissue and also shooting and earring through skin like that is not good!! i got my ear lobes done twice with a gun and didn't hurt, and then got a helix piercing with a needle- this is what professional shops will use, making sure it is all very sterile - autoclaved etc. with a needle it didn't hurt when the needle went through and it just kind of made me grimace a wee bit when the ring was put in afterwards. the day i got it done and the following day i couldn't sleep on it, but i can now and only hurts a bit when it gets caught. just make sure you clean it often with warm water and sea salt, other than that it's all sweet, just make sure you  get it with a needle! <br>  <br>  :D
7i87xw9caa	You are simply one of those people whose body does not tan easily, probably because you have little melanin in the skin. This is genetic, anything that alters your melanin levels (sunbeds,tanning injections) can cause skin cancer. Why not try applying a good daily tanning lotion such as St Tropez for a Natural looking colour. I use it, it's quick easy and doesn't streak like a full on fake tan.|`|AA11447210	Some people just don't tan easily at all. They burn quickly and have a hard time staying in the sun long enough for a tan to build. <br>  <br>  Start out with 15 mins in the sun, with low SPF sunscreen. Build up to 30 mins, 45 mins, etc until you can stay out several hours without burning. <br>  <br>  I tan naturally or tanning bed. The bed is nice during the winter months when it's not good beach weather. By the time it's warm enough to hit the sand, I have a good enough base tan that I can stay out several hours instead of just 30 mins.|`|JOfW3U5taa	well, its still winter..<br>  so i dont really know what you can do

WbVE1cXKaa	saying striking is sort of saying both memorable and unique, even attractive but not in the typical way.  It is mostly used in a complimentary way, although it could also be used as a polite way of not saying something worse (thus your question).<br>  <br>  But "striking beauty" is a relatively common usage, and for me there is definitely a difference between "pretty" and "beautiful".

BYcA9xx6aa	i don't think you can get it pierced with a glass retainer... if you can, i sure didn't know that (i was never even given that option).. i got mine pierced with a regular titanium ball closure ring. <br>  <br>  at the time when i did have it and i had to go to work and school, i just took off the ball but kept in the post, and it never felt like it was going to fall out or anything. also, around the time i first got it, i would quickly put in a retainer and just kept that in for awhile (but i don't think you should be messing with it like that when you first get it done, but i took a chance and did it anyway.. didn't give me problems).<br>  <br>  yah, sorry if i'm no help..|`|DFix2lgbaa	no you will not be able<br>  you can put in a retainer once your piercing is healed and you can remove the jewelry that it was pierced with<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|AkFIVDjQaa	most likely you won't be able to<br>  unless you do it yourself<br>  but it depends on the place you go to<br>  just go there and ask<br>  otherwise just wear a bandaid over it & say you had a mosquito bite that you scratched open & now its infected for about a week then change it to the retainer<br>  don't worry it's not too soon to change it if you keep it clean & look after it well<br>  <br>  x

msNXomjTaa	Dark circles are usually from lack of sleep, and dehydration.<br>  <br>  Most people say they get enough sleep, but actually don't.  The vast majority of us need 8 to 8.5, although you hear people all the time saying they need less.  Usually, not true!<br>  <br>  Also, people often do not drink enough water.  This also causes the dark circles.  <br>  <br>  So, sleep, drink water, and be happy!|`|HkIatVdiaa	wrap um some coffee grounds in a warm wash cloth, the caffeine totally wakes up your eyes :]|`|GFHRpDE4aa	You get them from to little sleep or to much sleep, so try to get the perfect 8 hours and they will go away after a few months.|`|fcNY5vLiaa	try getting enough sleep it works|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massage the area with pure almond oil.

F2rI3Juaaa	Get a spray tan - Don't risk using a sunbed to look good for your b'day cause you may not see another.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Nope. Not enough to get good color with pale skin. Especially since when you first go you really just need to get a base tan. <br>  <br>  With pale skin you want to go maybe 2-3 times your first few weeks for 10 minutes each session. Then gradually add time from there. Once you establish a base tan you'll be able darken it up. Products are helpful though, specifically ones designed for tanning beds. Invest in quality. You have to be careful though, you DO NOT want to burn. It's not like a normal sunburn either. It itches like no ones business usually in the areas where the sun doesn't shine! It takes a lot more caution with pale skin as burning is a real possibility!<br>  <br>  I recommend getting a spray tan. More effective in your case and a zillion times better for you!!|`|gNFPy6S0aa	Why don't you just inject yourself with PURE CANCER and save some money?|`|QaJGkXp2aa	Don't overdo it. Tanning should be done sparsely, especially if you have pale skin. It can be very toxic and it will age your skin.

(You can dress Hott withought being slutty) <br>  - If you live near a Macys in the Mall.. Ask your mom if you can get a makeover.. (when your their ask the professional if she can give you some certain tips on how you can do your makeup nice, and pretty)<br>  - Invite some of your friends and the boy to the movies or something to show off "your new look"<br>  <br>  Whether you want to get a nose job: thats your choice,, not mine! Be sure to confirm that with your parents before you make the final decision.<br>  <br>  Be sure not to load up on tons of makeup! It will just make more Acne! Try clean and clear or proactive! Get a manicure! Pamper yourself to feel good about yourself! You can do it! Just little steps at a time! And I know you can get into shape! YOU CAN DO IT!<br>  <br>  Well I really hope I helped! And ENJOY your new YOU!<br>  Have Fun! and GOOD LUCK! <br>  <br>  Love, Jenny|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	Just get enough sleep, exercise, eat lots of whole foods, and drink tons of water!

So, i started being myself again and dressing up and doing the things i love. Im not the prettiest girl out there, but i get a lot of complaiments now just by smiling and being me. So, stop caring about that boy or those friends. There are so many people out there, just go out and find them instead of sitting there worrying what others might think of you. Btw at this age, every teen gets somewhat an acne problem and it will clear around 18 or 17. =] hope i helped!.|`|h7igZipgaa	Well do you wear makeup? <br>  Makeup always boosts everyones self-esteem<br>  Go to the mall and get a MAC makeover and buy all the items that they used.<br>  Go to the hair salon and get a trim and let them straighten or curly your hair or something.<br>  Buy a new outfit<br>  ^^Those things will really boost your self-esteem<br>  <br>  And hun, keep your head high because others would kill to see you fall!<br>  <br>  Be Sassy!<br>  Dont let anyone tell you your ugly<br>  Be Proud of yourself because your the only one that can see your own flaws<br>  <br>  GET A LITTLE SASS A FRASS|`|Y0O6971laa	Don't do anything to your body you will regret.  Just don't eat many fatty foods and work out a bit.  You are most likely going through an awkward phase where your body's hormones are evening out.  the Chubbiness will turn to curves as long as you take my advice and your face will probably get better again.|`|AILK0BTiaa	please do not get a nose job.. First I really ask that you seek God first. Put him first in your life and I promise you, you will have unspeakable joy.. Exercise.

jbrzPF9Eaa	Eyeliner in a brown shade. Mascara in black. Gold Eyeshadow. Pink Blush on the apples of your cheeks. Don't put on too much, it will look bad. You have a nice face, so you can get away with a cleaner look. also, to keep that dewy complexion, spritz your face with water and pat dry before you put on makeup. Remember to use the bare minimum!!! Hope It Helps!|`|of8vwsUMaa	Since you have light skin and bright eyes I think softer make up woud work for you. I suggest lining your eyes with a dark eyeshadow on the inner lid, and thin on the upper lid. Then lining a bit thicker with brown eyeshadow. I always suggest Blondie from Nars for pretty much everyone since it will suit most people. When lining your eyes make the line slightly thicker towards the end of your eye.<br>  <br>  For your lips I suggest a light colored gloss, not necessarily clear. MAC's Lipglass in C-Thru or a transparent soft pink.|`|7f1gz6JTaa	just a little eyeliner.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  your pretty!|`|Y0O6971laa	all you need is concealer/powder to get rid of your redness.

If she got one, I'd still love her.<br>  <br>  Really, just get a small peircing, and if a guy likes it, he'll be attracted to you, if the guy doesn't he probably won't be.

HVpeJzM4aa	1. IF you're actually going to get a tattoo that someone else already has and you want it the same size you're looking at about $600-1000 depending on how good the artist is, if he charges per hour, how much you intend on tipping him/her, and how reputable the tattoo artist is. <br>  <br>  2. First, everyone takes pain differently but in the natural order of things women are designed to take pain a lot better than men, and it seems by theory that the younger you are the more resilient to the pain you are. But the back in general is not a high pain area, however the pain will creep up on you as the hours roll along. Also, if the tattoo artists says he wants to do this in separate stages (outline first, then shading and details later) make sure you only pay what you got for each session or you will get ripped off. <br>  <br>  3. Depending on how good or detail oriented the artist is I'd estimate at about 4-5 hours total if he manages his time well, you don't take too many breaks, and if you do it in one sitting (which in my opinion is a lot better than pussing out and spreading it out over time.) P.S. if it takes less than 4-5 hours then the artist is not doing a very good job with details. The shading alone will be a 2.5-3 hours process. <br>  <br>  4. No. It's a tacky tattoo and not very original. I've seen variations of this at tattoo conventions. Get something that is of your own design that way you'll appreciate it more and people will praise you on your originality.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	Cost - ￡700 or more for that tat size and its coloured also depending on tattoo studio and where you live<br>  <br>  Pain/Time - it would be done over a few visits outline first visit then i imagine a 3 hours max each time after that. Its gonna hurt and it being that big it will itch. The outline is the most painfull part but all the pain will be tollerable. <br>  <br>  People deal with pain in different ways tho, you might be fine or cringe with every line. Im getting addicted to tats and the pain is a good part about it, might not make sense now but it might make sense after you get one lol<br>  <br>  Do i like it?- Its ok|`|Yp15y9zRaa	1. Cost ￡600-￡1000 depending where you get it done and the quality. Make sure you go to an artist who you KNOW is good. Check out their other work, speak to people who have been inked by them and demand to see a portfolio.<br>  <br>  2. Quite a bit but obviously you would get it done in stages, outline first then the detail later. You go a bit numb after a while so it' not too bad, you kind of get used to the pain I guess. My foot tattoo was really painful at first but after the first few jabs of the needle it wasn't too bad, and this is bearing in mind that I hate needles.<br>  <br>  3. Probably 5 hours for the outlines and detail. Then maybe another 2 for the shading (as long as it is being done properly). I would suggest doing the tattoo in seperate sittings though. Go for the outline, let it heal, then get the detail, heal, then the shading. It might seem a cowardly way to do it, but it will let you split the cost.<br>  <br>  4. No. Honestly, it's horrible. So many people get angel wing tattoos, they are tacky and common. Just type 'angel wing tattoo' into google and you'll come up with thousands of hits. Try getting something more original, that has meaning (or at least get something that looks good). I don't mean to be harsh but you'll appreciate a quality, well thought out tattoo a lot more then you will this one in a few years time!|`|uLHyDOm1aa	its way to ott<br>  just imagain yourself with that when your 65<br>  not a good look then is it?<br>  tatoos do hurt alot<br>  (been there done that)<br>  but dont go to ott with them (like that)<br>  they may seem nice<br>  but it can get way too tackie<br>  it would cost quite abit<br>  but it completely varies<br>  from ￡200-20,000<br>  thats how unprediactable the tatoo industry is now<br>  dont get ripped off<br>  and stay clear of little holiday tatoo shops!|`|gO3aZ72baa	hmm thatd cost quite alot 2 get done, not 2 sure exactly how much tho soz maybe around ￡100 in UK!? i think itd hurt quite a bit 2 as my sister got hearts down her back and that hurt her quite alot but after a few months now after rubbing ALOT of vaseline in it it looks amzing! itd take a long time 2 get done possibly around 5 hours! and yes its amazing! i love it!<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  xxx|`|HWkWL90Faa	that will be pretty expensive! and painful but not unbearable. it would take more that one sitting, possibly 2. and i hate that tattoo, one of my friends wants that same tattoo, but that doesn't matter. your getting it for you and you if you want it tattooed on your body for life, then YOU should be in love with it|`|WxxFCz00aa	That would cost loads. It would REALLY hurt, probably take hours and no its horrible. imagine wearing a bikini in that :S LOL and you can never get it off obv. so no i wouldent get that done!|`|EgqtI7ovaa	Id say it would be like ￡900+<br>  it would KILL<br>  hours<br>  its original but its too gothic for my liking, something a little lighter maybe?|`|RWjYk1gHaa	i love it, i have alot of tattooes so i dont think it hurts but probably closer to the spine would be no fun. it would take more that one sitting an depending on the artist a couple hundred usually a hundred an hour is good price. if its your first one but you want more i would get the other ones first its an accuired pain...|`|6VnAdXaLaa	get something original and not what a lot of people have|`|DTlFaJkaaa	Something that large from a reputable artist will cost at least 1000.|`|WQbHHOJ4aa	It's going to cost a lot...like maybe $1000...depending on where you go it could be even more.  <br>  It's going to hurt like no other.  I just got a large tattoo done on my shoulder Thursday and it took 4 or 5 hours and by the end I didn't think i was going to be able to finish it.  <br>  Something that large is going to have to be done in sessions.  And to do sessions you have to wait 2 weeks until it heals to go back and do more.  So it could take a while.  But only the artist you go to will know that.<br>  And I don't like it...it's common and not even close to original.  I think that a tattoo should have some meaning for the owner.  Maybe this does have meaning for you but I highly doubt it.|`|b3zGfYMpaa	I cant really say how much it would cost, but your probably looking at well over 300-500 bux considering the size and if you want the color, but it also depends on your artist. Make sure you do go somewhere that is red-cross approved. Also, ask to see their sanitizing machine..if they dont have one..RUN! Make sure that you see everything come out of the package so that you know its new.<br>  As far as pain..the outline is the most painful and considering there are alot of lines it can be a very irritating feeling as you know if you've ever got a tattoo. I have a tattoo on my back, where the skin is thin and when the needle hit the bone is when I experienced the most pain. I got the sensation like when you hit your funny bone (yea, not a good feeling, but not overly painful either). The top most painful places to get a tattoo is the rib cage, the foot, and in every crevice such as; the armpit, back of the knee etc. I would avoid these places for a first tattoo.<br>  It doesnt matter if we like it, its up to you. What they normally tell you to do, is have an idea for a tattoo and if you still like it after sometime than go for it. I usually like tattoos that represent something. You dont want to get something you'll regret later so make sure you put alot of thought into it.|`|iBVtIXuSaa	i would imagen somewhere in the region of 600-700 depending on the studio. <br>  i will hurt alot.<br>  somewhere in the region of 3-5 visits prob 3 hour long.<br>  i think it looks awesome. but its not what all of us think its what you think that realy matters.<br>  <br>  best regards.<br>  reaper|`|hqlx5KDFaa	that tattoos quite cool. i would say it will hurt a little!!1 and you will be looking at a few hundred ￡￡￡ to get done.<br>  it will take a few hours or even be done in 2 sessions.|`|kew2l7Acaa	A lot, a lot, hours and no it's sh**.

mJ4UHvKfaa	when using foundation, you wont ever get the EXACT match of your skin tone. bare minerals is the best way to go, so order some of that.<br>  <br>  if you cant afford it, make sure to never get foundations in "natural" named shades, they tend to be either more orangy or pink. <br>  have you tried "classic ivory"? its never pink for anyone i know who wears it. <br>  <br>  always make sure to get oil free makeup and if you can, foundation with salidic acid in it. its skin clearing.

I personally use the Secret Camouflage Duo from Laura Mercier and I find it works well.

l3rJFgveaa	Bare Minerals is a good makeup, sheer cover is almost the same, but you really should go for bare minerals is great and the original mineral makeup. They have many different kits, for eyes, lips, face, cheeks, and everything you could possible ask for. They also have the best brushes i have everytried. I love the brand<br>  It really depends on who you ask and what their skin is like, though.<br>  For me, I have oily skin so it is great, it also does not cause breakouts (you can even sleep in it). If you do not cake it on it looks very natural, however if you have alot of facial hair this and most other powders are not for you, the powder will stick to your hair and look cakey and fake. For people with dryer skin it is not the best, you should look into the *Maybelline* line of mineral makeup. They have a liquid and a powder foundation. This however would be the cheapest "good" mineral product, in my opion.<br>  <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/whatsnew/miner..." rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/whatsnew/miner...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Mac also has a great line of Mineral foundations and makeup. <br>  It is a longtime name in the industry and has good reviews. <br>  here is a link to there mineral line, they have mineral liquid and powder so it would be a great choice. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp...." rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp...." rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  All 3 of these products have palletes to fit every womans needs, including women of color. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Another great makeup (its not mineral) that is good for older or more mature skin (women in their 40+) would be *Lauren Hutton's* line of makeup. <br>  it comes with brushes, that match the facedisk so that you know where to apply everything. It is truely a great buy.<br>  here is the link for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.laurenhutton.com/facediscspec..." rel="nofollow">http://www.laurenhutton.com/facediscspec...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Alot of people, do not realise that the way to great foundation is a dry, clean and prepped, canvas. You should always wash your face with a cleaser, apply a toner, moisturizer, and a primer. Bare minerals comes with a primer but a great one other than that is *Smashbox Photofinish Face Primer*<br>  It minimizes the look of pores. With the right makeup routine and application you can make your skin look proffesionally done!<br>  <br>  All of this is out of my experience as a makeup artists and long time fan of all these brands. <br>  hope this helped you.

Wet stone on wet feet are the way to go. Just rub where the callouses are, like your heels, and you'll feel them disappear. It's just like vigorous scrubbing. Use the scrub. Rinse, dry, and finish with the lotion. It's like an at home pedicure!<br>  <br>  I like to keep a pumice stone in my shower and use it each time I shower--keeps them softer. I wear flip flops and lots of uncomfy shoes so it keeps my feet from getting ugly!
HQa1nwWvaa	I have very thick hair and I suppose it is because of genetics. My parents have thick hair and therefore, so do I. I did, however, go through a short phase when my hair began to thin out when I temporarily became vegetarian. When I returned to eating meat again, my hair grew back 10X thicker. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you eat more protein in your diet as well as balanced meals with vegetables and fruits. I also take a multi-vitamin and I hope you do, too! Drink plenty of water, at least eight glasses a day. Most importantly, don't brush your hair too much. It causes breakage and may thin your hair slightly. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that we are in the winter season and we tend to shed our hair naturally because of this. When summer arrives, our hair will begin to grow in a faster rate than it is right now. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uRg3IAWtaa	yeah i agree  hair extensions are the go  thicker and longer  but the only thing finding the right colour and for a full head of them that are decent  its around $200  <br>  <br>  hope this helps  <br>  <br>  xxx|`|11QzdN87aa	well there's hair extensions, there can be cheap ones or expensive ones..|`|jHOmAoFHaa	You can try using clip-on hair extensions.<br>  They're very easy to use, but they're pricey.<br>  It ranges from about 30-70 dollars.

Other vitamins and minerals that are believed to contribute to hair growth are: biotin, beta-carotene, biosil, B complexes, magnesium, sulfur, zinc, silica, nettle, and flaxseed oil.<br>  <br>  Do not over brush your hair and NEVER use a bristled brush, as this will tear and damage your hair. Not to mention it doesn't feel very nice!!<br>  The 100 strokes a day myth will not help your hair!<br>  <br>  Avoid excessively hot water as well as blow dryers and curling irons, and dont over wash your hair.<br>  <br>  Another tip to try is to eat a square of jelly everday.

If you see what I mean.<br>  <br>  Then take a darker grey or even a charcoal colour and put a thin coat of that just over the eyelid, not up to the top of the socket but again out a bit,  creating 'wings'<br>  <br>  Then take a white eyeliner and line the inside corner of your eyes and a black eyeliner and line your whole eye, getting darker towards the outer corner.<br>  <br>  Finally put on loads and loads of mascara and maybe false eyelashes to add more dramatic effect!|`|O3U7aLCDaa	I'd recommend checking out <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/</a> <br>  And type in smokey cat eye look and you'll find a lot of videos showing you how to.  Good Luck!|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	You are so beautiful even without make up. You have cute blue eyes. God has given you such a perfect beauty. As for me you don't really need make up. Thank God for being you.|`|nV7XBzGAaa	i would recommend using a light grey eyeshadow on your lid, blend a slightly darker grey in the crease above your eyelid, then a black eyeliner (m.a.c. eye kohl, or maybelline unstoppable eye pencil are the BEST) close along your upper lashline. then take an angled brush and gently blend a bit of black eyeshadow on top of the eyeliner. blend it up a little bit and up the corners (cat eyes). add mascara and done! good luck, it takes practice! also, do under eye concealer after the whole thing, because all that black and grey eyeshadow usually gets all over your face:)|`|3zgmAJHIaa	first of all, i really like your picture. <br>  but getting to the question: i think with your light eyes what would look good would be a smokey eye with a blue base as opposed to a black base which might look to harsh with your eyes and hair which are on the lighter side. it might also make you look a little washed out with a black based smokey eye. <br>  By a blue base i don't mean like a bright blue... i mean the blue like in the twilight quint from dior<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P224725&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=1073" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  the only thing about this palette is that it is on the expensive side.<br>  stila has a palette that has around the same colors that is a bit less expensive<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P173010&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=3865" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  the color is listed below: the sapphires.<br>  what i love about the smokey palette from stila is that it is perfect for a beginner because the palette talks you through putting the make up on.<br>  sorry for rambling BUT another way to do this look would be if you already have these colors from mac: for the dark blue either deep truth or naval; for the dark gray either knight divine or silver ring; for the light blue moon's reflection; and for the light silver a color like electra.<br>  It really depends on the make up you prefer to get.<br>  I hope this helped and wasn't too much information.|`|cR2bGT8Eaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z49yr0zk_pk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z49yr0zk_...</a><br>  <br>  this might be a good look for you!|`|XZ93XBAjaa	You don't need makeup you are already attractive as is.

Both are a bit short for a prom.  Maybe not for a junior prom, but senior prom, I think, should be better.  I just got a cheap dress for my junior prom, and then, for my senior prom, I went all out.  So, it really depends.  But, if it had to be one of those, I'd choose the blue.  It's more classy, and a little more elegant than the black one.  The black one kinda looks like a ballerina dress.  Not to sound rude, but that's just my opinion.  Well, Hope I helped!  Oh, and remember, it's prom, so whatever you decide, I'm sure you will look nice, and I know it's great to get compliments, but it's best to just have a great time, cuz you will ALWAYS remember your prom night!  Have Fun! : )|`|PNnYTqyzaa	The black one's nice, but seems a little short for a prom.<br>  I would go for the blue one, it's really pretty and just the right length: not too short or too long.

bmRkisSMaa	When you get a facial done you are opening up all the pores on your face. Doing this would definitely make it easier to get rid of all the impurities already in your face but if these pores aren't closed up you're giving out an open invitation to the 1000001 germs and impurities in the air, so by the time your pores close they've got a new set of dirt clogging them up...hence spots.<br>  A way to fix this is after you get your facial done or after your face mask splash your face with cold water IMMEDIATELY and get some toner (preferably refridgerated) and apply it on your face with cotton wool. This closes up the clean pores.<br>  <br>  As for the scars...I've been using bio-oil on my face and can see a slight improvement. Some people recommend lemon juice but personally I haven't tried it. If you do make sure it's diluted in some water.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Because it is bringing all the crap out of your body.

It helps A LOT with the clumping.<br>  <br>  So, some recommendations.  If you want I nice drugstore mascara, then try the Maybelline Define-A-Lash for volume in the pink tube.  It is amazing!  Doesn't clump, separates, lengthens, and raises your lashes.  You can get it at basically any drugstore.  <br>  <br>  If you are willing to spend around $20-27, I would recommend the Dior Show mascara by Dior. It works wonders.  It makes your lashes so big and dramatic, separates and lengthens which is what a mascara should do.  You can buy that at any Dior counter at Macy's, Bloomingdales, etc. or Sephora, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|h7igZipgaa	CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER MY MASCARA QUESTION!

AILK0BTiaa	use a foam wrap one each section before rolling your hair. also get a hooded dryer. it will not damage your hair.. the hooded dryer will help straighten your roots.. also have you tried mizani products you could use their thermasmooth products to help straightening the roots if you want to use a ceramic flat iron. I would suggest only using the flat iron once a week.. but i think its a good idea to use the flat iron to go over your hair after removing the rollers.. :o)|`|wSPr2577aa	I'd recommend you use plastic rollers (are you using velcro's) and as for the other answer use one of the variety of therm fixing products which comb through before applying your rollers right down to the roots. <br>  A hood dryer is a good idea as it will cut down the drying time and stop the rollers moving against your scalp causing frizziness.

AfVR1ip1aa	The key to getting long hair, for black women in particular, is preventing breakage.  In most cases your hair is growing at a normal rate, but it breaking off at the ends when manipulated (combed, brushed, etc.) Follow these tips to try and minimize breakage:<br>  <br>  1)  Read the ingredient labels on the hair products you buy!  Steer clear of mineral oil/parrifinium liquid/petroleum (all the same thing), sulfates, and parabens. If you read these on a product ingredient label, that should raise red flags for you.  A lot of products contain these so its some times best to concoct your own hair care products from natural recipes or purchase from natural hair care lines like Burts Bees, Aubrey Organics, Qhement Biologics, Blended Beauty, Avalon Organics, Kinky Curly, and Carol's Daughter.<br>  <br>  1A. Avoid products containing mineral oil like the plague. Aside from being a by product of gasoline, mineral oil clogs your pores which retards growth and prevents moisture from reaching your hair on a molecular level. Instead opt for natural oils like coconut oil, grapeseed oil, olive oil, carrot oil, etc to seal moisture into your hair after you wash it.  These are not chemically derived and will not give you the negative impact mineral oil does.<br>  <br>  1B.  Don't use shampoos with sulfates in them.  Sulfates are  harsh chemicals found in a lot of shampoos.  It's also used in engine degreaser and floor cleaner...ugh.  <br>  <br>  1C.  If you use gel, avoid the kind with alcohol in it.  There are some good moisturizing alcohols, but the kind most often found in gel will dry your hair out making it prone to breakage.  Most good ones say "Alcohol Free" on the label.<br>  <br>  1D. You should also stay away from products containing parabens.  A lot of scientists speculate that they help cause cancers.<br>  <br>  2)  Give co-washing a try.  CO-WASHING is a technique where you use only conditioner to wash your hair.  Wet your hair in the shower, saturate it with conditioner, then use a wide tooth comb to detangle it, and rinse.  Your hair will still be clean because conditioners have detergents in them which are less harsh than the ones found in shampoos.  Prefered conditioners for cowashing are Sauve Naturals and White Rain...you don't need an expensive one to do the job.Since water is the best moisturizer, you may co-wash frequently to keep your hair supple and avoid dryness - anywhere from once a week to every other day.  Once every two weeks or so, you can do an cleansing apple cider vingar rinse, which clarifies your hair and restores its pH balance.<br>  <br>  3)  Maintain a good moisture/protein balance by deep conditioning.  You should deep condition at least once a week under a hooded dryer.  Your hair needs added moisture and protein to thrive.  <br>  <br>  To figure out which one to use, evaluate your hair:<br>  <br>  3A. Does it feel dry?  Then you need MOISTURE.  Use a mixture of vegetable glycerin, water, honey, aloe gel, and a splash of cheap conditioner.  Apply to your hair, put on a baggie, sit under the dryer for 10-15 mins and rinse. If you're not the mixing type, try replacing the above recipe with a bottle of super moisturizing conditioner like Keracare Humectress. Use that with a baggie under the dryer. Seal in the moisture by applying a natural oil afterward.<br>  <br>  3B. Is your hair breaking off a lot when you comb it?  Then you need PROTEIN.  Mix together some banana baby food and organic coconut milk, put on your hair, cover it with a plastic  baggie, sit under the dry for 10-15 mins., and rinse.  If your not the mixing type, go to your local beauty supply store and buy an Aphogee Two Step Protein Treatment.  Most times, protein stops breakage in its tracks.<br>  <br>  4) Wear PROTECTIVE STYLES.  A lot of times, hair breaks off due to a lot of manipulation.  To counter this, wear styles that don't require you to comb it every day.  Some include straw sets, bigger braids like cornrows, twists, afros, etc.) This is important in helping you retain length.<br>  <br>  5) Consider taking a hair growth vitamin like BIOTIN or applying hair growth aid like MEGATEK in conjunction with your hair regimen.  Research the two to decide which would be best for your situation.<br>  <br>  6) Avoid direct heat as much as possible.  Direct heat dries your hair out making it prone to breakage.  This includes blowdrying and flat ironing.  Indirect heat like hard hat and bonnet dryers are much less damaging. For instance, if you flat iron your hair everyday, try replacing that with rollersetting your hair under a dryer once a week.  As a rule of thumb, the less heat, the better.<br>  <br>  7) Reconsider the tools you're using.  Frequently using fine tooth combs can pull your hair out.  Invest in some good WIDE TOOTH COMBs instead.<br>  <br>  8) Learn more about your hair by visiting forum.blackhairmedia.com to get more tips and insight about your hair.<br>  <br>  Getting longer hair is a process for most black women. This may seem like a lot of work, but experimenting with these products is interesting and fun...and the benefits (long hair) will far outweight the inconvenience.  I should know - I've grown my hair really long after learning all these things. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|11QzdN87aa	<a href="http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <br>  theres some small tips that work<br>  <br>  and hair grows on average 1/2 inch per month, some people more some people less.. so per year people grow about 6 inches of hair<br>  <br>  somebody i know, her hair grows about 3 inches a year<br>  my hair grows about 9 inches a year..  everybody is different<br>  <br>  and also dont wash the ends of your hair, it causes split  ends because the natural oils are being washed away, and the less split ends the less you have to cut it hence the longer you hair will be and also for more volume only condition the middle and ends of your hair avoiding your roots|`|85KrSJh3aa	I wanted to make my hair grow fast last year cause I wanted a longer style, so I looked online for something to help me.

You cannot do the same things for Black hair as for White hair. Shampoo no more than once a week. Condition! Deep condition! Do NOT use heat. NONE. No blowdrying. No hot curling. No flatironing. Do not do any styles that pull or stress the hair a lot. Hair grows an average of 1/2 inch per month. So, if you take care of it, it should be about 1 1/2 inches longer in 3 months. If you want it longer than that, you're gonna have to get a weave. :)

Personally, I feel the finer needles make better detailed lines and make a difference but at the cost of pain that is about 10x worse than a standard gauge needle. <br>  <br>  And finally, use tattoo ink only.

Off the rack will tend to be cheaper fabric, will not last as long, or be as comfortable.  <br>  These are easily obtainable at Fredricks of Hollywood, Victoria's Secret, Hot Topic or other shops.  If you are not quite sure what you want, they are a good start.<br>  <br>  I don't suggest wearing an over-bust off the rack corset long-term; they aren't made to support a DD cup.  For custom-fitting, tell the seamstress what your plans are, and discuss support and bra-wearing to stop chafing or pinching between the two.<br>  <br>  You can lace yourself into a corset, as shown on a few youtube videos such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkmz5ZNGdWM." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkmz5ZNGd...</a><br>  <br>  Results from long-term corsetting will last, as the corset affects your eating habits - you will find you will eat less when your waist is nipped in.<br>   <br>  There are a few websites you may want to peruse prior to starting your training to get additional information.<br>  www.staylace.com is a general corset information site.<br>  <a href="http://www.corsetted.com/shop.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.corsetted.com/shop.shtml</a> has a list of custom corsettierres.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and enjoy your thinner waist!|`|laV4iX6Haa	I've been tightlacing for a few months so I can share some experiences.<br>  <br>  First as far as a corset, I recommend underbust for everyday wear.  That way you can wear a bra that fits you.  Plus overbust corsets look weird under clothes.  <br>  <br>  You definitely don't want a corset from Victoria's Secret or Fredericks.  There is a disclaimer on the Frederick's site at least that their corsets are not made for tightlacing.  They have plastic boning and are stretchy.<br>  <br>  There are a number of corsetmakers out there that make corsets just for tightlacing.  The least expensive is Meschantes.com.  They also sell on ebay and their corsets are cheaper on ebay.  They do have off-the-rack corsets you can buy by waist size as well as custom corsets based on your measurements.  My training corset is a meschantes corset I got from them on ebay.  You can expect to pay about $150 for a training corset from Meschantes.<br>  <br>  There are better quality corsets available from wasp creations, dark garden or other places.  These will generally be at least $250 for a corset.  I recommend starting with Meschantes to see if you will really keep up with tightlacing.  If you find it is for you, you can get a better corset later on.  But then if it's not, you haven't spent too much.<br>  <br>  When you start, you will be able to cinch down a few inches immediately, but will resume your normal shape when you take it off.  If you wear the corset every day, it will change your eating habits and over a few months will start to move your ribs in a way that might stay if you take the corset off.  <br>  <br>  I wear mine about 10 hours most days.  I don't think it's permanently changed my figure at all because I don't wear it at night or anything.  I do prefer the way my figure looks corsetted though :-)<br>  <br>  A couple of other things to be aware of: definitely wear a corset liner or tank top underneath your corset, to protect your skin and the corset.  Your skin will probably get very dry underneath the corset (for me, especially on the sides where it cinches the most) so make sure you use body butter or some other moisturizer before you put on your corset each day.  It is a real pain to have itchy dry skin that you can't get to unless you unlace.  <br>  <br>  You'll also find at first that sitting is weird.  You can't slouch or lounge like you can without a corset.  You may need to adjust the way you sit or prop yourself up with pillows when you're on a squishy couch so that you're comfortable.  It kind of makes you realize why Victorian furniture is so severe.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Use cream (i would go for the one from Clinique Dramatically Different Oli-Free Moisturising Gel but if you go to Boots they will help you chose your own one), Leave cream for 10 minutes before you apply your foundation. <br>  In school use absorbing sheets. Boots has some cheap brands and they all work the same (honestly I don't see why you need  to spend a lot on good brand absorbing sheets where they all work the same).<br>  At night wash your face, removing all the foundation, cream from morning and 'dirt' (like dust etc) from your face,<br>  Make sure that all products that you use are oil-free.

Keeping the 1st set clean is yr main priority for now.|`|tBUtvh8uaa	they did when i got mine done a 2nd time... um ur ment to wait 6 weeks and if u go bak to the place u got ur last ones they might not do it, but if u think ur first pair are healed enough you can go somewhere else... u only have to take them out for a couple of minutes...|`|paZpnQ5daa	Yes they do, there needs to be enough room for the gun and your entire lobe will have to be cleaned to make sure theres no dirt on your ear. I waited for a year until I got my second set pierced in. The best thing you can do is wait for a few more months and keep your ears clean in the meantime. Your ear is probably still quite sensitive from your first piercing and there is still a chance it could get infected, imagine you had a second set put in and they got infected as well. It would hurt.|`|JArE2DGuaa	I think for practical reasons you might have to wait because unless you have very small stud earings it would be hard to get the earing gun around the studs and make it awkward. You only have two weeks left to go so try and hold on :)|`|Ndntdlc2aa	i have 2 too!! haha. no really, i think itd be better to let it heal. the gun on tthe second one could knock ur first earing and infect it. better to be safe than sorry|`|SXRa4p8Vaa	i think there`s no problem having ur 2nd set w/o waiting for the 1st set to hell cos u can have 3 sets at the same time so if u want it done why wait?

oSfXwfnfaa	It's true that a lot of us girls want not just to be pretty but to be the prettiest, and so seeing other very pretty girls can make you feel jealous. Try not to compare yourself with others, that does no one any good. You already feel you are pretty and that's great, not many other girls think that way.Instead of focusing on the other girls, try enhancing your own looks. Go and get that hairstyle that you want, if you think it'll look good on you.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	What catches a person's eye is not just prettiness.  It's also a confident air and an attractive attitude.  We've all seen girls who are quite pretty, but who slouch and pout and frown.  That's not good.<br>  <br>  Life is not really a beauty contest.  If you know your looks are above average, and you have a nice sense of style about your clothes and makeup, that's all you need.  You're free to concentrate on other people's interests, your family, your studies, and all the other neat things out there in the world.|`|xZmepGVUaa	It is only natural to feel something when someone very good looking appears.  Men as well as women sometimes feel jealous, because they think others will not pay attention to them.  Just let it go, and as you age it will not affect you as much.

Just don't let it get the best of you.|`|QPiwb7hKaa	there are many kinds of pretty. maybe they're pretty in a way you would like to be? i know i feel that way a LOT. :( what i would try to do is find what specifically about yourself (your eyes are pretty, your skin is clear, you can pull off a chunky necklace, etc.) and when you pass a girl like that just tell yourself that you're pretty in your own way and everyone is different. go through your list of things you love about yourself. i got this idea  from my psychologist (ehehe it's weird i know) but it works and you can apply it to a lot of situations :D hope i helped. and didn 't sound too corny DX|`|hHZpiFmqaa	No this is normal, all girls get this just some tend to not show it.<br>  <br>  I dont think there is anything you can do to stop this, try to stop judging people at all because this helps you feel 'equal' and if you feel equal theres no reason to be jealous at all.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|W4sNRgs3aa	because you think your pretty,but you think their prettier than you and you don't like it,that's not cool you need to chill out.Theres gonna be girls that look better than you,doesn't mean your ugly though.|`|ogs0AZA3aa	Beauty gets attention/Personality captures the heart|`|b254402c3452aa13b435ab458b526fffaa	you shouldn't do that. green doesn't go with your complexion|`|p8rxpA98aa	Because very pretty girls r very pretty.|`|0QqFd23Saa	If that is you in the picture then you are really pretty,I have blue eyes and dark skin and I hate it!!I like the oriental look more.It's okay to admire other people's beauty,but you should appreciate your own features.I guess I should take my own advice huh?|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Jealousy is a waste of "mind time"... and it's not an attractive trait to have.

Yp15y9zRaa	It sounds like some of the hair is breaking off and leaving behind the 'root' I guess you could call it.

You don't give your eyebrows enough time to grow back so when you pluck them, a little tiny bit remains. So you're not actually 'plucking' them, so much as your 'cutting' then. <br>  <br>  If you let them grow a little, Im sure they will look fine. I have this sometimes when I don't let them grow.
PagDRzHjaa	I think it is true - A girl i sit next to said she never really had spots till her dad started abusing her - and then when she moved to her foster family they went because she was no longer stressed. My class also got told by the school nurse during sex education about what causes spots - and that was on her list. <br>  <br>  As for getting it to go down - try a spot cream or gel - and another thing that i find helps is if your rub some of that anti - bacterial hand gel on it because it kills the bacteria (as you probably guess). Or by soaking it in anything with a high alcohol content should help clear it up. I also her holding an ice cube on it helps and stops it hurting although I have never tried this method. I also would not try to pop the zit - as this can drives the infection deeper down into the pour of the skin and cause it to come back up again but even worse, it can also spread the bacteria. However if this is what you usually do then I suppose it works for you :)<br>  <br>  To prevent spots you can buy a product like Clearasil Ultra which cleanses pours and use a face mask to remove oil<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|7AfEG5rWaa	aids give me zits|`|bc013d45d546bad4f59ce63801728cabaa	I get them when i'm stressed around my jawline...

The wild olive tree originated in Asia Minor, today the countries of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. It is commonly used in cooking, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps.<br>  <br>  In addition to the internal health benefits of olive oil, topical application is quite popular with fans of natural health remedies. Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the preferred grade for moisturizing the skin, especially when used in the oil cleansing method (OCM). OCM is a method of cleansing and moisturizing the face with a mixture of extra virgin olive oil, castor oil (or another suitable carrier oil) and a select blend of essential oils. Olive oil is also used by some to reduce ear wax buildup.<br>  <br>  Studies on mice showed that application of olive oil immediately following exposure to UVB rays has a preventive effect on the formation of tumors and skin cancer.<br>  <br>  Jeanne Calment, who holds the record for the longest confirmed lifespan, reportedly attributed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance to olive oil, which she said she poured on all her food and rubbed into her skin.<br>  Olive oil is unlikely to cause allergic reactions, and as such is used in preparations for lipophilic drug ingredients. It does have demulcent properties, and mild laxative properties, acting as a stool softener. It is also used at room temperature as an ear wax softener. Olive oil is also a potent blocker of intestinal contractions, and can be used to treat excessive Borborygmus.<br>  <br>  Oleocanthal from olive oil is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) similar to classical NSAIDs like ibuprofen. It has been suggested that long-term consumption of small quantities of this compound from olive oil may be responsible in part for the low incidence of heart disease associated with a Mediterranean diet.|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	Are you talking about regular olive oil or extra virgin olive oil?

KOj8XOHPaa	For competitive swimming, padding will actually drag you down.  A lot of men shave their legs for this sport because the lack of hair can reduce 15% of the energy used.  Imagine what padding can do!  <br>  <br>  As an A cup myself, I understand what you are going through, but believe me:  looking back, I'm glad I had the figure that I did.  YOU will be your worst critic.  Don't worry about it!  For a one piece Speedo that is made for competitive swimming, I'm afraid that there isn't much that you can do to supplement your boobs.

They are just the cups of the bra and they stick onto your clothes on the inside. I don't know how waterproof they would be though.<br>  I think you need to get a swimsuit you can pad, because if you try to sew anything under swimsuit fabric the stiches will show.<br>  Any padding you just put in without it being properly fixed to you or your swimsuit will probably pop out as you swim.<br>  Maybe you could sew a strapless bra or bikini top to the seams of your swimsuit so the stitching is hidden. I don't know how well it would look but you could try only stiching where there is a seam.<br>  make sure you see how it looks on first because it might just be a disaster...|`|pDZomZqraa	You shouldn't really be bothered but if you are really then try cutting skips in it for padding then sewing them up again, sounds like alot of work though :||`|7060eafce3928f5687a405e1d56fae80aa	I wouldn't bother about it, as you see the olympic swimmers actually make their boobs just about non existent|`|JOfW3U5taa	why do you want to padd your bathing suite ?<br>  <br>  are you trying to impress the girls you're competing with :S??
Y60IEiqWaa	a great way to keep curls or waves in your hair for a longer time is rag rolling, it's an old fashioned methodd, but it really works. <br>  <br>  curls used to stay in my hair for only a couple of hours, but i rag rolled it after washing it one night, took the rags out in the morning, and the curls stayed in for 3 days!!<br>  <br>  a great thing about this is it's simple, only takes 10-15 minutes, easy, doesn't involve coating your hair in chemicals, and its cheap, all you need is an old pillow case or material, cut into strips.<br>  <br>  cut the material into strips about 6x2 inches, get a strand of damp hair about 1 inch, fold the material over the tip of the hair, then roll it up to the roots and tie it in a loose knot. do this for all of your hair and sleep on it (its  not as uncomfertable as it sounds). In the morning remove the rags, and voila! curly hair! and i guarentee it will hold for much longer than  with any products :)|`|HMFklJMHaa	put in rollers over night or go to the dominican salons where they put rollers in your hair and put you under the big dryers lol that would work|`|rqYy0RJVaa	Tresseme hairspray works really well, has memory tecnology do ur hair rememebers the style!<br>  X

H3PcFertaa	Gorgeous tattoo, absolutely breathtaking. <br>  As to the feather on your hand, can you go to the same tattooist who did your back? If so, I am sure that he/she would have wonderful ideas about the feather design.<br>  Otherwise, something soft and delicate, I think....<br>  I found this, and it seems to go well with your piece as far as style, and so I thought that it may be helpful:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://bp1.blogger.com/_It_M-r58-5M/SHq-7bMYOzI/AAAAAAAABGg/5Ag9DJptYpo/s320/feather1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://sealorraine.blogspot.com/2008/07/yuko.html&usg=__0IvmWXU_k3OcQru2p6mClnLAXbU=&h=315&w=320&sz=23&hl=en&start=13&um=1&tbnid=AqOHOqkN-YXUEM:&tbnh=116&tbnw=118&prev=/images%3Fq%3Ddelicate%2Bfeather%2Bdesign%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  Why not have a feather, but not necessarily the exact feather from your back artwork. Think of how the same feather can look differently if moved around, and maybe do something different but similar and it would clearly match and go with as a continuation of the original piece.<br>  So, my thought is not to add anything with the feather, but make the feather soft, delicate, and beautiful and you will not need more than that.<br>  You could send this question to the artist Yuku who did the work above, and maybe you could have her design something for you?... it may be worth a try.<br>  <br>  good luck, I am sure that whatever you end up with, will be beautiful~|`|AA11066099	Work of art!!

63Ac7vDyaa	You should get a fine tooth comb or a teasing comb/brush from Sallys Beauty Supply if there is one where you live they work really good for teasing hair. Also get a good hairspray like TIGI Bed Head or Big Sexy hairspray pull up a little hair at a time and take the comb and tease your hair by combing the roots up and down a lot and take next pieces of hair and repeat... You can also get this new product called "Bumpit" and you grab your hair put the bumpit and cover it with your hair and style it as usual and you have the poofed look without all the work!

6aEhPcDAaa	I have the same problem.  A lot of people say that eating cucumbers work, but I don't know too much about that.  My mom uses anti aging creams by Olay, that are only like $30.00, and they seem to work pretty well for eye bags.  Other than that, try some foundation under your eyes everyday.  It might help a bit. Oh oops, I just noticed that you said without a product...well then, cucumbers I guess, but that isn't much help.  Sorry :P<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica.|`|w01ub95Jaa	Cucumbers work best|`|37d008406c53b5147cb8d7e0a9059923aa	Some people say it might be not enough rest BUT I have really heavy dark dark ones too, all the time, even when I get enough sleep. Try  to see a doctor becasue it's possible it's being casued by allergies. I'm always sniffling too so we think it might be that. I'm going to do that soon. ^^|`|oKMOQIsoaa	try one of those age creams by OLAY... my mom uses them and they work great on her....<br>  <br>  you might want to put on a dab of foundation.

I like girls either way. Some girls even do a design in it.

It would make me cry.|`|X6rFPI2laa	I don't think you can convince them now, and doing it without their consent is just plain wrong, as well as a way to destroy any trust and respect they now have for you.  Your father may be like many other adults who see piercings and automaticaly think -- "who would hire THAT?!"  Since the adults are the ones doing the hiring and promotions, it's difficult for many teens with many piercings and visible tattoos to get that first job.  And, by the way, it is not unlawful to discriminate on the basis of tattoos and piercings.  I think you would be wise to wait until you are of legal age to have a piercing done without their consent and until you are no longer being supported by your parents.|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	Don't whatever you do go behind your parents back!

Going behind their backs will only mean they will have trouble trusting you in future anyway. You're almost 15, legal age can't be too far off. Tough it out.|`|AA12359047	When you're 16, you can get it done without parental consent. So wait a year.<br>  <br>  And convince them to let you get it? Ha.

xSdnsSojaa	Being a "girly girl" is a matter of attitude, not wardrobe. Some girls can dress like a lumberjack and still be feminine, while some others could put on a Sailor Moon outfit and still come off like a guy with boobs.<br>  <br>  That being said, yeah, give me a "girly girl" any day.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	There's a difference between what catches a guy's eye, and what he "likes".  The flashy outfits, loud colors, and revealing styles get noticed, all right.<br>  <br>  But a better indication of what a guy really likes would be what the girls he usually talks with are wearing.  You're doing well, with your concept of a consistent look of your own with your favorite colors.

2Dy6jZBtaa	well u don't needa section when u hair dry if ur just going to straighten it with an iron...all u needa do do hair dry is put it above ur head, let it blow down on ur head for a few minutes as u shake it a bit and aim it at certain spots...and to get a lift, just turn ur head upside down and blow dry the roots a bit more and let cool for a bit. its an easy 5-8 minute dry at most...u don't needa dry it all the way just a bit to get a lot of moisture out...there is a straightener that is for wet to dry, which works well for damp but slightly dried hair...there are a lot of them out on the market that work great. go to amazon, type it in and narrow the category down and for the sorting, just click avg reviews to see what works the best for most peoples...u can do that or u can buy a special brush that straightens as u dry ur hair with a blow dryer...its basically like a brush that looks like an iron...<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235215587/ref=sr_st?keywords=wet+to+dry+hair+straightener&rs=3760901&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Awet+to+dry+hair+straightener%2Ci%3Ahpc%2Cn%3A3760901&sort=reviewrank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1235215587/r...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=100315&navAction=jump&navCount=6&skuid=sku3646399&id=prod3647553" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a>

This happened to my sister once when she got her eyebrows waxed.<br>  <br>  Either way, if it doesn't go down after a day or two, or it gets worse, go see a doctor. In the mean time, you can try using some aloe vera, or lotion with aloe vera in it (like when you get a sun burn).

X605sT7oaa	Okay, well firstly you need to make sure that you condition it well and make sure that you have no split ends, else it wont grow any longer, so get a trim to make sure the ends are tidy, and then dont use products such as straightners for a while. Also dye it black, or dark colours it is a very emo style. Purple is also cool, but it depends on the shade of skin tone. <br>  Once it grows long enough go to the HAIRDRESSERS - not the barbers because they won't understand - and get it styled.<br>  <br>  Show them these type of pictures:<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yqQJe8VD5Ek/RvyX77AhKeI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/MykMREkPKso/s320/emoboy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yqQJe8VD5Ek/Rv...</a><br>  This ones really nice:<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SHStZ8SNMII/AAAAAAAAAa4/4vu825NeQHk/s400/Hot%2BEmo%2BBoy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SH...</a><br>  <br>  they can cut it that way for you but you will need hairspray and styling mousse etc to keep it in place.

I managed to get my hair long enough in a few months. All you  have to do is get it regularly 'trimed' (Not cut). This makes the hair grow fast and keeps it neater. Then when its long enough (usually just starting to go over your eyes) you straighten it and Voila! you have your haircut. I suggest getting someone to cut it into shape when its long enough as some people find they have to. Mine sorta naturally did it.|`|q2Nxg5aKaa	do nothing...let it grow for 2 years... then regret not cutting it earlier and shave it off...|`|K5f07qkRaa	trim it a little bit once a month|`|keEwsjxYaa	first of all get rid of all split ends .. otherwise your hair won't grow and have it trimmed regularly.. when you have the right length go to your hair dressers and have it cut and styled and dyed whatever. but always have it trimmed so as to keep split ends down and so not to let your hair grow to long. if you;re one of those "emo's" who straighten their hair be sure to use anti-heat hair products .. i'd suggest john frieda.<br>  goodluck&hopethishelps x|`|bqGExMW1aa	don't you will regret it

qHcEBN2Zaa	i had the same problem as you at one stage. But that was when I was around 10 years old. It cleared in the course of 2 years without much help. But my mother's cleared in 2 weeks. You MUST NOT AND I REPEAT MUST NOT test A lot of products to try to get rid of them!!<br>  Use natural remmedies! they work the best and a lot quicker. Try rubbing tomato pulp into the infected area. Grated potato is the best way though. It pulls the heads out and reduces oiliness. Use it every day until they are out enough to be removed with a head remover. If you don't like removing it with a head remover, keep using it on an everyday basis until it can come out through using a facial scrub. Steam your face before putting the potato on though. Works best like that.<br>  <br>  Just don't use products from the store! It might damage your skin severely!|`|jUiCcrnKaa	go to a dermatologist.<br>  they'll probably recommend the best creams/solutions to help you.|`|cb8d9061f02810c2cced8d65c11335bdaa	Have you tried using a facial mask? In your case I would recommend 2-3 times a week in the beginning. Facial mask draw the dirt out of the pores. It brings it to the top. You usually leave them on for about 10-15 and they dry and your face feels tight. When you rinse if off and apply some moisturizer your skin is left feeling great. Just a thought. Good luck...|`|YsDwo7Dqaa	Proactive|`|xktBgoKFaa	You have to use steam. Only steam will unclog deeply clogged pores. But you can't just steam for 10 minutes. Your clogs are tough, so you should steam fro 30 mimnutes. If you don't have a commercial steamer, you can bend over a pot of hot water with a towel over your head for the same effect. Once opened, use a glycerin soap (neutrogena makes one), then rinse with warm water. Then, it's back to the steamer to reopen the pores. Next, use a clay mask. The mask brings the impurities closer to the surface. After the mask dries, wash with warm water. You will need several applications if your pores are really clogged.  But be patient. This regime works.

I know it is kind of girly, but you could try a moisturizer from Cetaphil. It's good that you keep your hair off of your face to stop the excess oils. Try to develope normal sleeping habbits with at least 8 hours a night. Eat healthy and drink plenty of water. You should be good:)
UYnZtJ2daa	Probably not. You need to have the real copy of your picture id with your birthdate on it. Anyone can edit a picture on a computer to say their age is 18 or older. You need to have a real ID.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Firstly, don't call it a 'salon' in front of the artist! It's a studio. Secondly, probably not. And if they do accept it they have lax standards and probably somewhere you don't want to be going. They should have the same standards as bar staff - I've been barmaiding in the uk for three years and you'd be laughed out the door if you came to us with a photocopied ID. This is what I tried to do when I was underage in pubs - photocopy my ID and change the numbers on the computer - it looked convincing and if I can do it so can you, so a REPUTABLE studio will not accept that as form of ID! Have your dad send it to you via same-day courier so it won't get lost - might cost you a bit but just call it an extra payment for your tattoo!
AA11442090	As a hairstylist, I would cut it below your chin and give you a choppy layered angled bob, or a really short cut where there wasn't much length at all.

AILK0BTiaa	i would suggest trying a lighter conditioner and washing your hair every morning.. :o)|`|wwzoqIvVaa	I find if I rinse my hair in really cold water, it seems to help.  Have a good hair day=)|`|1A9TdN4yaa	Washing often is not going to help because you are further aggravating the problem. Scalp is dry . You have oily hair because the sebaceous glands are over active . Anyway, we need to solve the problem, the deodorant you use should be free of chemicals because many deodorants contain led and other chemicals which close the pores and the body is not able to get rid of toxins and these toxins in the system create acidity and weaken hair follicles . You need to pay attention to your diet. Plus lack of proteins and vitamin B6 always aggravates so internal nutrition is what we need to pay attention to.<br>  Check a website which will guide you to healthy hair www.ziravie.com<br>  <br>  <br>  I can suggest a lotion which is a natural formula made of essential oils and extracts of fruits and green plants penetrate rapidly through the scalp, providing rich and deep nourishment to hair follicles and hair gets strengthened.<br>  It has a calming effect on the scalp, Reduces itching, Eliminates dandruff and split ends.<br>  This I can tell you with confidence because this is my personal experience. It is a 100% natural lotion with NO secondary effects.<br>  Plus the website www.ziravie.com gives you a chart for internal nutrition. If you don't have confidence in the product do try the juices which I know will help as it helped me. But this demands dedication of at least six weeks to see results. There are no miracles existing we ourselves are miracles.|`|K5MmKus7aa	Find a good shamnpoo and conditioner to stop greasy hair.|`|OKE1uyJaaa	Neutrogena T/Gel shampoo is good for dry hair|`|nJ04psJ1aa	u should use Olive Oil. believe me, it makes the hair really good.|`|MYRm9nMbaa	There are two products I can recommend for this problem, which I have as well. AVEDA 'Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque' which you use once or twice a week. I am amazed by the results (and it smells great!). Natural oils begin at the scalp, so when using conditioners ant treatments, avoid the root area and apply from mid-shaft and work down to the ends. For daily conditioning, use the same application method, but choose a light water-based conditioner, like 'Shampure'. Also, Kiehls makes a wonderful product called 'Creme with Silk Groom'. This is a styling aid and it conditions and moisturizes the hair while using silk powders to absorb oils. Use this product on wet hair, again applying from mid-shaft to ends, wrap in a loose bun if you want and go. Both products may seem a bit expensive, but it doesn't take much for them to work and they last a while. These are my tried and trues; everyone I have ever introduced to these products love them!|`|XKFLLLDnaa	I have really thick hair because I have afro hair. <br>  <br>  And it does get annoying sometimes, I know how you feel!<br>  <br>  I use GHD IV Wide Styler, specially designed for specifically only wide hair! I bought it quite cheap and it's well worth the money!!<br>  <br>  Don't use it too mcuh as it can burn your hair, but it works like magic and makes your hair look really silky and normal!<br>  <br>  And for the grease, another problem I used to have, every morning when I wake up I use natural ingredients hair shampoo, and I wash it and comb it thoroughly. Then I condition it (most shampoos these days have shampoo and conditioner in one!) and leave it on for a few minutes (2-6, depends) then I wash it. And it's really quick and easy!<br>  <br>  Although cream can make your hair look shiny and make it look less thicker, it's mainly the one providing the grease to the hair, so use it only little. About the amount of one drop.<br>  <br>  When the ends and roots go dry, put some mousee on it (little amount) and pat it then comb it through thoroughly. <br>  <br>  For a list of many hair products I use for my thick hair, then don't hassle to contact me!|`|AA11442090	As a hairstylist I would recommend that when you have three days to not do anything do not wash your hair. For a whole three days. Then on the fourth day start washing it every other day. This never fails, your retraining your hair.If you on a budget I would go and get some Biolage shampoo and conditioner. Stay away from Pantene they have to much wax in there products. Good luck|`|qM06B8Ziaa	use a cleansing shampoo with a leave in spray conditioner, but don't put the conditioner on the ends of your hair, try a spray one this will be easier to do|`|cDqLCZyzaa	rub yogurt on it in the shower.

intuNZllaa	Mix some of your moisturizer with your concealer, so it looks a little bit lighter.<br>  <br>  Or, if you have cream blush/eyeshadow (LIGHT coloured) mix a little bit of that with your concealer.  (Powder blush wont work because it will be too chalky)<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|pc3RbN1jaa	If you do have something creamy to use, make sure it is yellow based.  A blush or bronzer will not work, because they are generally orange/pink/red based, which will not cut the pink or "cool" out of your concealer.  It has to be yellow/gold ish and not shimmery.  <br>  <br>  Or you can just go get a new one at the store??  There are plenty of inexpensive brands that get the job done.  All you need is something that will not crease or is not too heavy, and something by Loreal or Revlon would do.  Instead of you looking like your makeup came from the pantry!  Just kidding, unless you really do go hunting in your kitchen for something.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Now if you are 16 and have great genes, an occasional bath and good oral hygiene are sufficient. But even the genetically blessed must increase their efforts as time takes a bite out of them. So most people start with good skincare,then tweeze, and paint, many with such skill that you can't tell for the most part.Mostly it depends on how good one gets with a makeup brush. Actually with all the new technology in makeup it really isn't as hard as it used to be.

SkgJYDaCaa	Yes I think you would look very pretty with red hair. It would compliment your skin tone. I was thinking glazed strawberry or dark copper would look pretty on you (from the color chart link below) Good luck. The only thing that sucks is red fades really fast so go to a professional stylist (it costs more but it will be worth it) Good luck, I'm sure whatever shade of red it will look pretty. =)|`|BXgBZ5KVaa	yea i think you could pull it off, just some of the dyes that are used for red hair is like cheap looking and fake<br>  i feel like you would be better as a brunette like the first picture<br>   the prettiest red hair cant be found in a bottle|`|nmmGnWitaa	yea i think so just dont do a crazy red<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  this cut   <a href="http://gimps.de/pictures/albums/userpics/10001/hairstyles-for-short-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://gimps.de/pictures/albums/userpics...</a><br>  <br>  this color  <a href="http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs561/hji/medium/2006-red-short.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hji.co.uk/hjimages/images/qhs...</a>|`|CU9pfIR2aa	I think you would look fine. You do have a rather pale complexion, that might stand out more with a lighter red, but a darker red, or an auburn would not as much.|`|r1ccXg3Paa	Absolutely! It would really bring out your eyes! Another color you could try is dark brown!

470dc9e84094d2130c1ec379a4271d28aa	You could... but if your living with them and they are supporting you it would be incredibly disrespectful. I've got 2 tats and my parents don't approve but I got them after I moved out and was on my own. Plus, this way it gives you more time to make sure you really pick something your going to like for the rest of your life instead of rushing into a piece of flash your going to regret later.|`|YXTezzjjaa	There's nothing they could do if you get a tattoo, Unless you live with your parents still.|`|x8VmRaZZaa	Yes I have, I even pierced different parts of my body without asking them. My dad doesn't make a fuss, it's my mom. But the tattoos I have are religious or have some kind of special meaning to me. If you could explain to your dad that the tattoo you want to get has a special meaning to you he might not be that against it. I got a 'trishul, aum, my parents, siblings and grandparents names outlined as a heart and paw prints to symbolize my love for my dog :)|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The age in the UK is 18, and there is NO provision for parents to give consent for those under that age.

He never said anything again.|`|rnNn9Ervaa	haha, man this is familiar, I too am 19 and in the exact same situation...except I already have 7 tattoos. My parents are divorced and I live with my dad...my dads a cool guy so eventually (after my first two tattoos) I told him. Of course, I had to tell him because my mom found out (god damn facebook pictures) and was going to tell him anyways. He was really cool about it.    Now, my mom on the other hand went ballistic and pretty much had a nervous break down...told me to not get anymore...but I keep getting them (she still hasn't seen two of them).    I guess what I'm trying to say is, your parents will probably flip out, and that's inevitable, but you're 19. The law says you can do it, and it is YOUR body. Don't live your life according to what your parents want, because you will never be happy that way.    Of course, if theres a chance your father will kick you out, maybe think twice. Otherwise, do it, and in time, your parents will come to accept it.|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	Parents house means parents rules... if they say no then its no.|`|98NiEivhaa	yeah, i did, when i was 30|`|ymaVUEFZaa	well no... but i do know someone who has and let me tell you HER MOM WAS MAD!!! and they had a big fight too! i mean if you would like to get one but have to face the punishment later then go ahead.
EgbIYBehaa	I haven't, but i have posted similar pictures to do with my hair and makeup and such, and people just treat the question as one of those 'am i pretty questions' and yes, people are very rude, you have to feel sorry for them really, they must be really angry and bitter with low self esteem there selves, must make them feel better trying to upset people who they have never met, kinda sad really, and bordering on mentallyy unstable!  Oh and i have looked at the responses so far, and some of these people, preaching about how wrong it is and how patheic it is, take part in most of the taunting! i've seen there pictures before on those sort of questions... hypocritical or what.|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	No, I avoid posting pics and asking for ratings because people are so mean. Besides, I don't need strangers telling me how good I look anyways.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Nope. But I asked people what they thought my nationality was because Im clearly Irish and someone called me Italian. Some people just answered, some people said I was beautiful, and 2 people said I'm "wickid ugly." This was outta 56 answers.      Welcome to the internet.|`|WZa6GhS3aa	Nope because i would never do that people beg on msn but no matter how sure you are about yourself anyone can get hold of that picture and could do anything you never know they could print it put it around town place in on sites such as bebo and make fun of you.|`|v0owu3cBaa	No. I don't need people to rate me. I am who I am and people rating me won't change anything.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	Ive done it sometimes, but it doesnt really matter cause someone who post his/her picture for people to rate him/her will only stop when they get what they like to hear.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	Nope, I haven't posted one.   But I'm brutally honest to those that do.   :D    Don't ask, and you won't get the glaringly obvious truth.|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	I have never posted this question about myself or a friend.  A true friend would never pose this question.  As for me I am perfectly comfortable with who I am and what I look like.  This question is a sign of immaturity.  I have never seen an ugly person post this question which normally means they are fishing for compliments.    You expect when you post this type of question that everyone is going to say something nice about you.  The truth of the matter is that if they say you are not pretty you think they are mean.  There are some that are just mean for means sake.  Me, I will tell the truth, as I see it.  If you are not pretty in my eyes (and beauty is in the eye of the beholder) I will say you are just average.  I have never called anyone ugly, other than they neighbor's dog which I love anyway.    This question  often gets deleted because it is against yahoo rules.|`|KGQYogeraa	yep, some people say that im really pretty and others say im the ugliest person ever. weird i think.|`|ymaVUEFZaa	fortunatly no... but i dont think people should post pictures to rate yourself UNLESS you dont care what people think.|`|M9tH99gfaa	yes...but if u post  a pic u shuld expect ppl to tell the truth...theres no point if every1 says ur pretty|`|UxdjYFJaaa	LOL and the (obvious) lesson is - DON'T POST PICTURES ONLINE FOR PEOPLE TO RATE YOU WITH!    Sorry to write in caps but its really desperate and self-absorbed, don't you think?    I'm sure a lot of other people do. :)|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Nah, I really don't care what people online think of me so it would be rather pointless.|`|8f81c557782db78a6e0cfb5ef1ca75a0aa	I've never posted a picture. When I rate someone else I am honest with my answers but am never mean. I always find something nice about them. Their hair,or eyes,or skin, smile, if not I don't answer the question. No since in being down right rude to people. But I don't lie to them either. If I think they are attractive I say so. If not , I find something else to say.|`|czAbrzcUaa	No but if you post a picture asking people to rate you, you should expect nasty comments - not everyone is going to think you are pretty. And if you're upset at getting mean comments then you love yourslef too much and think a lot of yourself since that would mean you expected everyone to be nice and think you're gorgeous.
4AnOHrAPaa	First, clip it as low as possible,  very, very carefully with scissors, then you can wax it off with very warm wax. They sell  brazilian bikini hair removal kits in drugstores. Here in DC, we have Rite Aid and CVS. I must warn you, it feels like an eyebrow wax times a million down there. I really don't think that ripping the hair out of your nether regions is a fun idea. It will stay gone for a very long time if you do decide to do it this way, though. Shaving is easier, but it doesn't last as long, and can leave you with irritated skin. Test it on your arm first. If you cannot tolerate that, I don't suggest waxing. Cream depilitories, like Nair or Neet or Veet, that don't require shaivng or ripping your hair out are another alternative. They just really, really stink. Like rotten eggs. But the good thing about that is you can just rinse the hair off with water or wipe it off after several minutes and the hair comes off smooth and painlessly. Just be careful, though. Those things have strong chemicals in them, so try not to get it to close to the inner workings of your nether regions. That would not be good! Enjoy your hair removal.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	I shave too.And I use a razor,and shaving cream,and have done so,for years.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	I shave. Just easier for me.

Fd4EBV1Vaa	Satin and chiffon are extremely delicate materials that are usually dry-cleaned and some times hand washable.     Any stains should not be wetted and wiped. Chiffon in general distorts when wet and far more damage could be done than can be undone once it is wet. The fabric will not return to its original state after it has been stretched or shrunk.    Staining and spills are usually treatable through a dry cleaner. Dont attempt to clean the stain yourself. Remember chiffon stretches and shrinks when wet. It is advisable to clean your garment after every use. Do not allow stains and spills to stay untreated for any great length of time or you will have difficulty in removing them.|`|2ZqKDMMRaa	No wash it in plenty of hydrochloric acid it will be fine....|`|2dLf3KHnaa	u av left it a bit late start by dabbin with a damp cloth see if it start 2 take it out if i does wash it providing it isnt dry clean only|`|WOIZPlbmaa	DONT WASH IT IN HYDROCLORIC ACID!  but, if you put stain remover (eg. vanish) on the staining, and wrap the dress in a bed sheet, then wash as normal, it should be fine! hope I was of some help.

The girl talks way too much but she knows what shes talking about.<br>  You can always surf youtube to find tutorials.|`|2kKr0tzKaa	I am not so sure that you can get a perm with your type of hair? If you can you might have to have it done by a perfesionelist or something. I have a friend with really thick hair it is also kinda curly and she says she can not do a perm in her hair her self. <br>  <br>  With your curling iron well it depends on what kind you have. If you have aminy one that is not going to work with thick hair. You should get a big curling iron for thick hair if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>                                  *Good Luck*|`|sqUVjpElaa	Perms only come pretty tight, even with the largest rods.  If your hair is thick, a perm will be pulled down pretty good, making the curls tighter.  BTW, how long is your hair?  Maybe you should look on www.youtube.com on how to curl your hair.  I've seen some pretty nice "how to" videos on doing hair.  You probably need to get a new curling iron too.  Make sure you use small pieces of hair, on the hotest setting, and hold it there for a minute or so.|`|Zi0g5K3Iaa	You'd better make some layers and then perm. If you want leave your hair, you can straighten it.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	what about using mousse for curly hair and buying a diffuser for your hair dryer??  you wash your hair, towel dry it, add the mousse and scrunch your hair with your hands while you use the diffuser.....<br>  <br>  perms are very hard on your hair, so i would think about that before you get one, you have to take really good care of it|`|i38Ev1Zaaa	you can get a perm, but they're super bad for your hair.<br>  <br>  If your curling iron isn't working for your hair, it's probably a cheaper curling iron. Since you have thick hair, your going to want to invest in a heavy duty curling iron.<br>  <br>  a gold plated Hot Tools curling iron is one of the best you can get:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1012.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1...</a><br>  <br>  if your on a budget, you should definately check out a wigo. They're just a step behind the Hot tools, so they should work fine on the hottest heat setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2167361&productId=xlsImpprod1000076&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat1000003" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  To curl your hair, your going to want to take a few steps before.<br>  <br>  if you have ringlets, then you need to blowdry your hair to remove some of the ringlets before you start. Just take 2 palmfuls of mousse, and work it into your hair, then brush it through, and clip your hair up into sections, and take a flat paddle brush and start blowdrying your hair to dry the mousse, and take the ringlets out.<br>  <br>  Once the ringlets are straighter (it doesn't need to be perfectly straight), just spritz your hair with a little bit of hairspray, and brush it through. <br>  <br>  Clip your hair up into layers, and let the iron heat up on a higher heat setting. Since your hair is thick, your going to want to go towards the highest heat settings.<br>  <br>  To start curling, grab a 1 inch section of hair, and run the iron about halfway down that section, then start curling. As you curl that section, press on the clamp to loosen the curl on the iron, and pull the rest of the hair through. This technique gets rid of the clamp mark that you often see, and it gets rid of the uneven curls/fried ends.<br>  <br>  Repeat, and once your finish with your whole head, let the curls cool COMPLETELY or they'll fall out!, then you can style it and finish it off with hairspray.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for choosing the size you need a 1 inch, or a 1 1/4 inch is generally what you use for an everyday look.<br>  <br>  For the formal looks, like spiral curls, or curls for a half updo, a 3/4 inch curling iron is usually what you need.<br>  <br>  For beachy curls, use a 1 1/2 inch curling iron.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
EiQtzZHPaa	The basic instructions for how to do a razor cut are:<br>  <br>      * Divide hair into even sections—part hair vertically down the middle and again horizontally about halfway down the back of the head. Pin up the top two halves and leave the bottom one free. This is where you'll start the razoring. <br>  <br>      * Hold the razor lightly. Less is more to begin with. You can always go back and cut more. Use a fine-toothed comb to pull up the hair at about a 45-degree angle and slide the razor in short, choppy motions (also held at a 45-degree angle) down the ends of the hair. Be careful to move your comb and fingers as you work your way down to the tips. <br>  <br>      * Work your way up through the back of your head, then begin work on the sides. If you have short hair, you can layer pieces at the top of the head as long as they're covered by more, unrazored hair. Do it very lightly and you can increase volume at the crown. <br>  <br>      * You can repeat the same procedure on the sides and the bangs. Just remember to go lightly and don't texturize all the hair — only pieces — until it looks like what you had in mind.|`|kpeZVNl8aa	If you don't know how to razor you hair, you probably shouldn't be attempting it.

Makeup is more of an experimenting thing it is really fun!|`|lgM3xZkWaa	No you're not too young.I am in 6th grade and wear eyeliner and mascara.I wear eyeliner on the bottom.Mascara on both.You should start with eyeshadow.Start with like a skin tone or like a light brown.Don't do colors like a red or blue.|`|owCzkhNRaa	you could try first wearing like mascara or something or some eyeliner.<br>  just don't over do it with the concealer if you use some so you don't look like a ghost you know what i mean.|`|intuNZllaa	I wear makeup, and I started at 14. Bad ideaaaa. <br>  Start when you're 15, or 16, is my advice.

Just don't go over board or anything. Eye liner is my favorite thing ever. Depending on your eye color, you can pick a color to bring your eyes out! Eye shadow as well!|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	i was not allowed to wear makeup till i was 16 but i think as long as you do light makeup it will be fine. you don't want to cover up to much you just want to enhance the features you do have. try a little mascara and eye shadow to bring out your eyes and a little blush and foundation if you need it. and some lip gloss. goodluck. just don't over due it. you have plenty of time to grow up!|`|ClnSGIS4aa	noo everyones wearing it now. <br>  I started wearing it at 13 :) <br>  just experiment with it, at the end of the day its your life do what you want to do. And wear as little or as much as you want =) do what makes you feel best. i think i wear too much, but ah well =P it makes me feel happy lol i dnt care wa people sayy cos i love standing out =P x|`|ILNNfCJSaa	I'm 14 too. And I also never used makeup.(My mom won't let me)<br>  14 is not to young. But you shouldn't wear to much. <br>  Wear it simple, like some mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and <br>  some lipgloss.|`|0T769lIuaa	no!<br>  <br>  i dont know any girls at my school who dont wear makeup! <br>  <br>  have you lived under a rock for 14 years?<br>  <br>  just dont wear too much :) lighter is better.

6kxWMPEQaa	They can tattoo just about anywhere on the body, so there would be no problems tattooing there.  The cost would depend on the shop.  Typically a shop has a minimum no matter how small the tattoo because they still need to open needs etc.  And cost varies from shop to shop so much.  I find you get what you pay for with tattoos.  The cheaper you go, the cheaper the work that you get is.  I would suggest visiting multiple shopping and telling them your idea and let them price it for you.     I would also think twice about tattooing a beauty spot right there.  Just because it looks "cute" drawn on now, is it still going to be "cute" 30 years from  now.  "cute" is not always the best reason for getting a tattoo.     Good Luck!|`|P1VoMS36aa	it not risky or expensive  but having it there,it wont stay beautiful forever,tattoos fade and blur.  they fade out quicker in the sun too,and on your face its always going to be exposed.  im not trying to put you off tattoos, i have a few.  i just think there are other places to put ink.  beauty spots are cute,and theres no harm in you wearing one.why not continue to draw one on.or buy some fake stick on ones?  hope thats helped   xxxx|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	dnt tattoo your face, it takes 2 seconds to draw it on why go perm?|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	it isn't risky if you go to a professional    but I would seriously spend a ton of time sitting on that idea before committing    Also, I'm refusing to acknowledge (beyond this statement) that you asked anybody other than the artist how much a tattoo would cost|`|ymaVUEFZaa	i think it would be fine.. but maybe you should ask the person that will do your tattoo. it might hurt!!  but i think you should do what u want so you will be happy with it... good luck :)|`|ilHtdYdTaa	Just keep drawing it on. Then you can take it off whenever you dont want it, like an accessory. A tattoo of a beauty spot sounds like a really lame idea.|`|nnKtP60Oaa	bare minimum $40 at a shop.......maybe less if you go to an esthetician....i would walk around 4 a week with a fake one on...then see how u feel.|`|VC8ivJHjaa	Think long and hard about this one, tattoos are pretty permanent. If you change your mind later it will cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to remove it. I suggest you just have your friend continue to draw it when you desire to have it.  As for costs, you are probably looking at $20-50.00 minimum to pay for the needle and ink used by the tattoo artist.|`|Ohn0oRSfaa	those are GAY! i have a real one and it looks bad if u get it tattooed so|`|uyWkEbINaa	A tattoo beauty spot it will just look a black dot on your face not really a beauty spot.People will see the difference.
q6RgxRVyaa	i think its  dark brown-at night  lighter brown- in the day time.   maybe your hair color changes because of the climate and temperature...you never don't know what can happen :) , but i say darkishlightish! :), oh my, im making such a fool out of myself :) lol good luck with your color changing hair :] :) :} ..hahaha|`|adyNCp6eaa	i'd say a dark sandy blonde.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	It looks dark brown to me. Your hair will do that, it's normal. My hair is naturally brown but when it's in the light it looks auburn; that's because the base colour to brown hair is a reddish colour; it's normal. Another reason my hair does that is because I have a lot of Scottish and Irish in my family (every hair stylist I've been too has said that). It's all in the genetics.     Unless you dyed it black and now it's fading?|`|5yYnZrJ2aa	Um.. Looks the same all over tbh :/  Its brown.|`|88ee473a945577c7d1c98a6136ebb421aa	Kinda looks green - may be the lighting??|`|NyB2HlmGaa	Brown.

ghowIqmVaa	I totally understand!  I have naturally curly hair and in order to keep it straight I have a strict routine that I use because it doesnt fail.      1.) Shower the night before, this helps make sure your hair cuticle is closed the next day and less likely to re-curl.    2.) Shampoo and condition as normal, when out of the shower, if you hair is prone to dryness such as mine I need to add leave in conditioner while damp as well which I love/use Charles Worthington Leave In Conditioner (http://www.drugstore.com/qxp169808_33318... and comb in with a wide tooth comb.  3.) Next, on damp hair, I apply a good straightening serum.  I use EasyStraight(http://www.drugstore.com/qxp202943_33318... ) currently which works but I make sure to follow step 4 if I use this, but my favorite is ION Anti_Friz Straightener which you can find at the Sally Beauty Supply outlets (http://www.sallybeauty.com/anti-frizz-st...  Comb this product in.    4.) Next, you may need to experiment with this one depending on hair type, but sometimes I add a little hair gel after this step (I use herbal essence curl gel; dont worry it doesnt activate curls).    5.) Then I blow dry with a diffuser however I dont crunch curls.  I just run my fingers through my hair to keep the tangles out and get my hair dry.  Im not trying to straighten my hair at this point, I just want it to be dry so I can sleep on it and not get any kinks and allow the hair cuticle to close and my hair to settle down.  You hair will not look how you want for school but this is prep.  My hair looks like loose curls.  Once hair is basically dry go to sleep for the night.    6.) The next morning when I wake up, I apply a frizz cream on it, I use John Frieda Frizz serum, and comb through dry hair.  (http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/produ...  7.) Then I straighten my hair in 3 sections; bottom, middle, and top layer.  DETAILS:  I clip up the middle and top half of my hair and straighten bottom layer, once bottom layer is straight I hair spray and tie that in a loose pony tail to get out of the way so I can make sure I get all the hair in my next group straight.  I then let down my middle and top half I have clipped up and section another layer of hair (middle layer) to straighten and clip up the remaining top half of my hair.  I straighten the middle section, hair spray, and then release my bottom layer from the ponytail and retie the straightened bottom and middle layers together.  Then I let down my last top layer and straighten this and hair spray.    8.) Now you have done the whole straightening thing.  So next I take out the hair tie and finger comb through all my hair.  I let my hair settle while I do other things such as breakfast or brushing teeth, etc.  Then I return, spray some finishing gloss on it (I use John Frieda 100% Shine:  http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/produ... comb through and do a final run through with the straightener on my hair where I feel it needs fixing.    9.) Once thats done I spray with a hairspray (I use Aussie anti-humidifying hair spray:  http://www.aussie.com/us/collections/syd... and Im on my way!  Hair stays wonderfully straight.      Oh, a little secret is I rewet my ends so they curl up again with loose curls.  This makes my split ends not as obvious as they are more severe on the ends and gives it a nice glamour feel to your hair.    Also something I keep in mind if I know Ill have to be outdoors for a longer period of time than desired I try and wear a hoody that way I can cover my hair and protect it from the environment as well.  That reinforces my style I wanted.

I have short hair and have been hassled about it before by guys who like long hair on women, I have stopped letting it bother me though.

IAStQqOHaa	Blonde reflects it tbetter. <br>  The darker the hair, the more light that it absorbs, and vice versa. :)<br>  hope i helped.|`|tv7a1ixiaa	I suppose it does, because darker colours hold more colours than light colours, therefore absorbing more heat and light, which could make it more shinier?<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  It may be the same on both colours but we notice it more on dark hair because it's darker?|`|Dyn8oLVxaa	black hair and dark dark brown color shine more than blond. when i bleached my hair blonde my hair did not have any shine to it. when i dyed it back to black it had amazing shien, eventually fading to a dark brown. just use like a shine product when you flat iron your hair. i use garnier fructis glistening drops.|`|MJMsOFpiaa	hmmm i don't think so.

AaWdWZmCaa	I have oily skin and what I use is Deliziosos 100% Natural Strawberry Foam cleanser. It freshens up my face and leaves my pores closed, and is filled up with nourishing vitamins extracts and oils. Take a look at it hera at:<br>  <a href="http://www.deliziososkincare.com/StrawberryFoamingFacialCleanser.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.deliziososkincare.com/Strawbe...</a>|`|idhcqr5Daa	Cut a tomato in half with a sharp knife. <br>  Rub the tomato halves on your skin. <br>  Leave the juice on for at least fifteen minutes. Let the skin soak in the juice, so that it saturates into the skin pores. <br>  Wash your skin with warm water, then wash with cool water. This closes skin pores and helps keep bacteria from spreading. <br>  Pat your skin dry with a towel. Tomatoes are acidic and contain potassium and Vitamin C. That's why tomatoes are excellent for oily skin! <br>  Always pat your face dry with a towel. Rubbing can spread bacteria, causing pimples. It also increases the chance of more wrinkles. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|52e7jxDjaa	Neutrogena  has an acne wash that is oil free and helps control blemishes.

KPsWriOOaa	can't you wear normal clothes and change into your sweatpants before exercising? If not, enjoy being comfortable for one day. Make it into a sporty kind of outfit by wearing converse and wearing a ponytail and maybe just a V-neck Tee. Sounds good to me and there is a certain limit as to which you can look cute for P.E. class.|`|igI5yX0vaa	Maybe some high-top sneakers.<br>  <br>  Cute girls make sweatpants look cute,btw.|`|511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	bell bottoms?

Then she put on a cute Hollister t-shirt with it - not too flashy....just some plain navy blue shirt that said Hollister in white letters. Then she wore converse with it. But if you don't have converse, then the addida sandals or flip-flops will look good|`|Bzuo6xt5aa	It's possible to make anything look cute.<br>  <br>  First, get a tank top. Preferably white with lace at the bottom, but if nawt, just get a tank top.<br>  <br>  Next, take a cute baggy shirt of yours and put it awn over. Tie it to the side with an elastic band. Put your hair in a ponytail, and grab a LuluLemon headband to yoga-it-up. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|OaLzlwzgaa	You could roll up the sweatpants to around your knee, and then with a nice shirt and some flip flops. That can look really cute if it's done right, but looks best with a tighter shirt since the pants are baggy to start with. And I would just bring sneakers in your backpack.|`|xGu2j3n7aa	Heres what you do: well, i would say wear sandals but since you said running, wear shoes your comfortable running in. dont roll them up unless you are wearing actual running shoes. wear something like a cute long sleeve shirt(:<br>  hope this helpedd(:|`|nmmGnWitaa	well if u have time go to bebe and buy some or ross or something ..if not wear a fitted shirt with them and wear low shoes u can roll them up to your knee and tie them with a rubber band. ?? sorry|`|SmwgLLd7aa	Roll them up to right below your knees, like capris. Then just wear good running shoes. It's really not a big deal.|`|LIye5Tvuaa	Yes def, but i like a more fitted kind if sweatpants like from roots. If they're not too baggy then you're good|`|leqZNLFPaa	oh hell yeah! <br>  super glue some sequence on there. <br>  maybe a pink ribbon and youre set.
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	If you kept the lacing very loose you may be able to dance, but it really depends on the type of dancing. I'm not familiar with Butoh, so I can't say for sure.     I've been able to dance with 120 needles in my back (just regular dancing at a club), but had some issues with movement when I had a chest/neck corset. Some of the people I've done corset piercings on have been fine moving, others found it difficult.     I also think you would have a hard time leaving them in for 5 days. I've found they're pretty comfortable for an evening, but if you leave them in overnight, they get a lot more sore.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I would have to agree with the above, from what it sounds like this probably isn't something you'd want to do with a large fresh piercing. I'd be more worried about infection (not only from sweat but people touching them, or any clothing or anything else that it may come into contact with), one getting ripped out or scarring from the early stages of rejection. It would also be a very expensive thing to do, even with the cheapest of the cheap jewelry you're still looking at $200-$300.       If you wanted to go for a permanent one, I would suggest that but it would be even more expensive and you would need to get it now so it has time to heal.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	never heard of it before but i looked them up and it looks kinda pain full and im assuming ur movement would be a bit restricted with them since if u bend the ribbon or whatever would need to stretch and it doesnt look like it can lol
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	it depends where you live.  where i live the scene trend continues to rage on like theres no tomarrow.  uggs have finally died.  lots of girls seem to be dressing more upscale than they used to, i see far less people in abercrombie and more people in almost business casual stuff.|`|wxcmnFEKaa	Retro fashion is the best.|`|kecpGboNaa	hair - i'd say bangs. side swept or full fringe. and either long or short, but i prefer long an so do most guys    clothes - cardigans! everybody sells cardigans. i personally love em and have like 6 or 7 different ones. i like the long style ones. super cute! and gladiators, another favorite of mine. there are so many different styles, and you can dress em up or dress em down. skinny jeans. its seems thats the only kind you can buy, but thats okay cause i've fallen in love with em. floral stuff is supposed to be big this spring and i think its very feminine and pretty.     these are just some things i've noticed, and things i own. hope this is what you were looking for|`|mTdU6XZMaa	retro !!  and gothic additions...not the whole style :)  good luck
Lg3SNqW2aa	Yes, you're allowed to get your lip pierced with an adult present, whichever side you want to get pierced though is completely up to you.    Edit: I'm in the Uk.|`|SDJ72zEPaa	take someone over 18 and get the left done|`|oBH8eypOaa	I think it depends on the state you live in. But most states you can get it done with parental consent. Any side looks fine. just pic you fave picture side. ha ha .|`|rbv59Hwaaa	i live in spain and the main fashion for girls is to have it on the left side (lloking at them). however only one girl was brave anough to get it done on the right side and i think it looks 100 times better    yes you can get it done with an adult present, just make sure you ask your friends where they got their piercings done to make sure you can have good aftercare etc.    good luck.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Which ever side you want    You will need a parent. 16 is usually the youngest you can get a piercing without a parent.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	yes ur allowed to get it at 14. i personally like the left side because u usually dont see people with the left side pierced. get an old earing (small hoop) and but it on your lip or draw a dot on your lip and see which side looks better|`|10ef8c48e3ba55a59f16e3badd0a5b52aa	top left always looks nice on a women|`|oQoVehifaa	I always get my piercing on my right side ( because my bangs part on that side =S ), but I guess it's just the side that it would look best on you. Try a clip on piercing on both sides first . And yes you do need an adult to get it done.  Hope this helps.|`|eKGU2ujYaa	with one of your parents present then yes you should be able to find a place.  I dont know what state your in.  and when i pierced my lip the guy did my right and I got a marlyn and I love it.    They will probably make little dots on your lip to see exactly where you would like it.  good luck|`|YXTezzjjaa	You should do your upper right lip.|`|ojj8NXmGaa	Depends bottom or top?    if you smoke it's best to get it on your left if your righ handed and vise verser because while it's healing you can still smoke on the opposite side of your mouth without disturbing the swelling.  That goes with eating too.  Also if you have any distinguishing features such as a mole on your face it might be a good idea to get it on the opposite side to avoid your face looking over crowded.    The top hurts more than the bottom. If you can imagine, when you try and squeeze a spot on your top lip it makes your eyes water. lol  The bottom hardly hurts at all and are really easy to keep but they rub on your teeth and make them rough and chipped.  If you want a ring it's better to get it pierceed with stud and change to a ring when it's healed. This is because when pierced with a ring the hole curves and it's harder to change. Also, I've heard of people who have had swelling over their rings and not being able to remove it.  I hope this helps, but warning lip piercings are addictive as it's an oral fixation, like biting your nails or lips.
8f81c557782db78a6e0cfb5ef1ca75a0aa	Why would you want to do this? It looks extremely painful.Plus what about infection? How do you keep them clean? Do your clothes rub on them? How do you change the rings and do they hurt when you sit down?|`|iver1TLWaa	i reaaally dont like them tbh  :/  i like a lot of other piercings, like sternum, but not corset piercings, i find them a bit weird  x|`|3LPTLUczaa	Worst. Idea. Ever. Full. Stop.|`|czAbrzcUaa	They look cool but corset piercings don't last for long.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	They're surface piercings that are meant to be taken out very soon after having them done. Basically, they're done for a night or a photo shoot, and then they're taken out and heal up. They aren't permanent piercings by any means. They pull and they're on a place in your body where surface piercings just don't work.     If you want them done, be prepared to take them out right away. Only do them if you're going to do a true photoshoot so that you can capture them well then get rid of them and heal up.|`|V7vSs13Kaa	I think they are Beautiful! go for it if that's what you want!  why not?|`|2u43QnUsaa	STUPID.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	okay i am EXACTLY the same way. i see it, i want it, i have it. just how i work. anyway a corset peircing is something i saw a while back & thought that looks amazing! but.... not practical. when can you actually show it off besides in the bedroom or on the beach? also the rings look painful, imagine if you fall asleep on your side but wake up on your back?? ouch! i think if you really really want it, then go for it BUT it is a peircing that will not last long, will probably be more uncomfortable than anything else, and will be hard to take care of because of the spot it is in. think very long and hard about it & if you weigh out all the pros and cons and decide you still want it, then go for it! good luck :)|`|EM5rQOGBaa	i think they look cool , wish i had the balls to get it done but i don't as think it wud be sore ,    it really up 2 u , as ur the 1's body it will be on .
5gin3E4aaa	It really depends on how bad the acne is. If it is too bad, the blemishes can be distracting from your actual features, and may very well leave a bad impression upon people. However, acne can be easily cleared by adjusting your diet and washing your face every day. It really doesn't matter what soap you use, and long as you wash your face daily. Also, you should use only one or two types of soap, so that your skin doesn not get confused.    Oh! And a tip from me to you... one of the best soaps to use is actually foot cream. It sound weird, but most creams have a very refreshing feel and leave your skin exfoliated and moisturized.    Not sure if I answered your question right, but I do hope that your problem is solved. Contact me if you would like any more information.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Answer is yes.    Because of that, I DO hope you get better!    To Sandie: There's no reason to have severe acne these days.    Actually, see, not everyone responds to the treatments that are available. So much for your ASSumption.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Yupp...|`|rMhJceVuaa	Yea I think it makes girls look worse, it just depends on how much you have; pictures?|`|nUcvCTI9aa	It can make someone look worse, but it won't turn a beautiful girl to an ugly girl. Acne usually comes and goes, and with some great make-up it can be unnoticeable. Espessially if you're young, you don't need to worry about it if you take care of your skin, it will go away eventually. :)|`|b1u9jlRhaa	yes acne is disgusting|`|of049X1waa	Try to fix it.  It is not attractive, but it can easily be fixed or covered up with make-up.  And chances are it won't make you into a hideous monster but it does make people look worse.  SO try make-up and drink plenty of water!  You can fix this easily.|`|DRtKIooFaa	Looooads of people get spots or acne even..  and i dont think it takes away from there prettiness..  obviously it lowers your self esteem but im sure people can see past acne and realise how pretty you are.    If it affects you really bad, see a doctor and he can help clear the acne.|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	Yea it can if you don't take care of yourself. And remember - Acne scars! So if you are popping and squeezing and not keeping it sanitary you will look bad the rest of your life. These days - there is no reason to have Acne, there are so many medications from over the counter to prescription strength, you just have to ask your doctor and they will gladly give you something. A friend of mines son actually had to take medication for his, it was like an internal thing. So it may have nothing to do with how or what you are cleaning your face with. If it's really bad, go to the doctor or get your mom to take you. There's no reason to have severe acne these days.|`|V9oNKkDgaa	yes, it does make people look worse than they actually do. i've seen girls with ugly face shapes/features, but because they have clear, smooth, tan, skin they look pretty. i don't know i guess that's how it works. but acne won't turn a pretty girl ugly. it'll turn a pretty girl into a pretty girl with acne. believe me, when my face was flawless i got so much more attention. the next year i got a little acne that was hard to cover up, and i got a lot less attention because my makeup was bad.. this year (i'm a freshman) i used clean and clear acne kit and no more acne! it works. just try it. hormones suck, and the acne will go away i promise you. don't sweat it, so many cute girls get zits.
kK4GG6Z2aa	Mmmm never heard of leather smelling of fish.  Why don't you speak to the company and ask their advice.  It is possible that they do need airing but again I would only leave that for a few days.  If the smell doesn't go away I would definitely return them and get a refund.  Don't forget that before you get shoes/boots they are kept in containers etc before even reaching the stores - and they usually smell fabulous.  That's all I can say - Hope that might help.  Good Luck...Oh and watch out for the cats if you wear them., I just had a funny picture of you riding followed by a crowd of cats.....my silly sense of humour.

5gin3E4aaa	First of all, you are a very pretty girl, and I know this is a cliche thing to say, but it really would help to show your face. However, out of those, I would definitely choose the first. It seems to be the best quality over all, and gives the best impression on how beautiful your face is.    Hope I helped. :]|`|czAbrzcUaa	They look almost exactly the same. Pick any (:  They're a bit over exposed though - try changing the settings on your camera.|`|oRr9SOIqaa	The third...although they're all bad pictures of you...I bet you're much prettier than they show.       Lipgloss doesn't hurt also.|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	The 2nd one I suppose. Why the gloomy look though? Do like a kiss face or something.|`|5c48a3d3646aac3d075adfdfcbebb73daa	I like the 2nd one best. I love the black and white photography, and I like the mood and overall look of this photo. :)    I want to add that I love the way this picture is so natural, I hate those posed, wanna be sexy shots, where the girls have their lips in a pout or are making other goofy faces. I like yours because it shows your true beauty. (And you don't have to be smiling directly into the camera to achieve this,as you have proved ;)|`|v0owu3cBaa	Third.|`|0fE4qkPyaa	first|`|U2CcS5rXaa	None. Take one of you and your friends eating cake and smiling. much more un embarrasing|`|GUGt3snzaa	none, look at the cam! DER....|`|ymaVUEFZaa	well if i HAD  to choose i would pick the second one... but i think maybe have someone take it for you because i bet your prettier when people see your whole face and lip gloss doesnt hurt either and maybe smile!! : )|`|qgpXxcuGaa	All fairly similar but I think the third one's best (: xo|`|2u43QnUsaa	Tard.

HIwJFtNlaa	I've talked to two people about it, and they said it works very well. I just exfoliate my face once to twice a day every day; and it keeps acne away.

vORwcxhkaa	You know, if you get some decent concealer, The eyeshadow quality should be relevantly the same.<br>  <br>  You can spend less money doing that trust me.

Put it on after the shower before your skin dries, or add some to your bath for smooth silky results.|`|flMNMS7Iaa	On a personal note, soft hands indicate a lack of physical prowess. Stop washing your hands in chlorinated water. Keep a Bowel of standing water and allow the chlorine to evaporate before using, it wont dry it out. And yes, this is why country girls have shinier hair. As for reversing the caulousation already there lotion is about the only real approach. But as I said, soft hands means you don't work.

What you want to think about instead? Will you miss them? You figure that out ;o)<br>  <br>  Third, as the husband of one of your kind - I know the girl does get scared as a teen when her breasts don't get bigger than yours... like "can this really be called breasts?" - but I also know that it certainly certainly can.

I used to hate it, too, when I was younger. Society puts a lot of  emphasis on body types and way to much on boobs. It isn't always easy, but just try to blow it off. Don't let it get you down. Just keep a good personality going and you'll find out that it really doesn't matter. It's easier to find clothes that look good on you and I always think about all the money I save on bras. Pretty soon you'll be able to joke about it. I poke fun at myself about it whenever the conversation turns to boobs. There's an old saying....'more than a mouthful's a waste'...and my hubby agrees.|`|TyKaRKGGaa	Some people just don't get much in the chest department. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Could be you look just fine without large breasts. Although if you want more boobage, the only options really left are plastic surgery which will give you fake boobs that neither look or feel right. Or perhaps pregnancy will work for you.

I have one on my right calf, not to bad till they get to the back more were there is muscle, left calf side, small, not bad, left chest, don't remember, long time ago. Neck wasn't bad at all, (back of neck) but when they got near the hair line it felt like they were pulling the little hairs out.<br>   Left forarm, not bad at all. Left hip, actually was terrified it would kill, only felt vibration and no pain. And right shoulder blade, that hurt in certain spots, had to stop and will get that finished soon.<br>   That one is being done by my husband who is new at tattooing so I can't count that one, lol. But all tattoos do have a certain amount of pain. More of a burning sensation. I do regret the one on my left calf. I hate it. I picked it off the wall, stupid. Oh and I have one on my right foot. I personally did not find that one that bad at all, yes there was pain, but not compared to others. <br>  Good luck and pick something that is original, not off the wall, and if you do like something on the wall, make it your own, change something on it.|`|AGSvzqMtaa	wrist and neck|`|JZMfUDylaa	getting your ribs done hurt the most but that's what I heard|`|WQmzTDhSaa	Feet, genitals, ribcage, front of neck, upper inner arms.|`|kLkzBbeAaa	chest neck love handles ribs hurt forearm upper arm lower back doesn't hurt much roll a cigarette over the area a little that's how it will feel sort of.|`|AA10739434	Inside the bicep is pretty hash.<br>  Neck is harsh too.<br>  On the head [skull] is BRUTAL|`|aqdDFdm8aa	anywhere near the bone or on it.

4UXJoMbKaa	Exfoliate with Baking Soda, and tone with Lemon Juice.<br>  Trust me, it works. Plus it's good for your skin. :)|`|5Hmyjr7Eaa	ok? what are you michal jakson? but bleach it if he is your role model|`|idhcqr5Daa	Stay out of the sun. Skin pales in the dark and tans in the sun. Stay out of the sun or wear the highest SPF you can find. Always head for the shade. <br>  Wear more clothes. The less skin exposed to the light, the less chance you will have to tan. <br>  Alter your appearance. Dark clothing and hair will contrast with your skin and make you seem paler. This is entirely optional. <br>  Take Care of Your Skin. Wash, moisturize, exfoliate and ensure your skin is healthy. Healthy skin will help. <br>  Use a whitening cream. Whitening creams are amazing, and can really lighten skin. Choose a safe product and read all warnings! Alternatively, you can look up natural methods for whitening. Milk, for example, is a natural skin whitener. <br>  Apply lemon and amounts of water to even out with the lemon on the parts of the body that you want the pale complexion to be. It will only take a few days for your skin to be pale be sure to do it about 3 times a day. <br>  Sprinkle an ounce of baking soda in your bathtub so you can soak for 10 minutes ONCE a week. <br>  Nail polish for girls is a great way to make your hands and feet look a little paler. Black, or dark -fill in color- <br>  Oatmeal Rubbing hands in oatmeal a couple times a day is an old fashioned home remedy that ladies at the turn of the century would use to keep their hands white and soft. <br>  If you must be outside, wear a high SPF, wrap up and stay in the shade as much as possible. <br>  Simplifying the steps you take to getting and preserving your pale skin will help you stick to your routine. <br>  Drinking green tea is good for your skin (antioxidants). Clear skin accentuates paleness. <br>  If you're a guy then get a clean shave or wax on your face so you dont have dark skin around the areas where excess hair grows. <br>  Apply a foundation a few shades lighter <br>  Pale skin burns very easily, and some complexions become very photosensitive. Beware! You don't want to get skin cancer, which is more prominant in pale people. <br>  People need sunlight to be healthy and produce vitamin D. Being healthy is more important than pale skin. (There are vitamin supplements available if you don't mind taking extra pills every day). <br>  Pale skin is associated with goth, emo, scene, vampires and the supernatural.But keep in mind that the opinion of other people don′t matter as long you feel comfortable. <br>  If you are using a skin lightening cream, use one with 2% hydroquinone or less. Use all skin lighteners sparingly, preserve their effect with sunscreen and limited sun exposure. <br>  <br>  x0x0_LEi|`|bEQqy5rVaa	Shaving... Using some sort of exfoliating product.

I am so anal its probably crazy, but it has made it easy for me to answer this question.  Please realize your eyebrows may never look exactly like this picture because unfortunately some peoples are just shorter than others( like mine), but there are a few things you can do!  1. never pluck between them. This shortens them drastically and you will never be able to get this nice arch look. Yes unibrows are awful so of course pluck the stray hairs, but each eyebrow should start directly above each nostril. use a pencil or pen to make sure they line up.  2. never pluck the top of your eyebrows this hair is the only thing that can really help you achieve an ideal arch.(even if it looks really scattered it still helps the arch look)  3. use vaseline, eyeliner, lipgloss, or anything that can change the color and clop together your eyebrows to trace the hairs you want to pluck and try to push them away from the brow. Doing this allows you to see the exact shape you will achieve and make sure both eyebrows match!    GOOD LUCK!|`|9MPVGWe6aa	get a very light eyebrow pencil, then draw the shape you want  then pluck all the hairs that are out of the line =]
fj3sHFfRaa	If a person has a natural high acidity level in his/her skin, it is possible for his/her finger to "turn green" from silver or gold jewelry, especially when the weather is hot and humid. The green is actually caused by oxidation, and all silver or gold will oxidize (it's also what gives silver and gold a tarnished look). There are some cheap jewelry items that cause the same effect. Most of them contain nickel. It's not poisonous in small quantities but it can provoke a reaction in people allergic to nickel.|`|jrB6z23Yaa	It must be fake normally gold ring doesn't bring any kind of allergy    Dhruvika  http://www.myjewelersplace.com|`|QcNLtVZFaa	http://magazine.gem-fashion.com/finger-t...

d3ctyNxRaa	You're pretty already :) But to enhance your beauty, I think you should wear some thickening mascara, and maybe some eyeliner, but not too much. Just enough to make your eyes stand out.

aClEgPgMaa	Yeah 'cause salt water can really dry your hair. Another alternative you can try though is braiding your hair after you wash it, and leaving it braided until it dries.

Dated too many blondes and well... They kinda ruined it for me|`|76v8JiUqaa	nope|`|BJwrgBn6aa	I think that you should stay blone, if anything get blonder highlights or maybe light brown highlights, and whatever you do DO NOT do it yourself! Go to a pro and get it done there, and i think that blonde is much prettier.|`|P1vws9YLaa	You should stay with blond unless its dirty blond then go pure blond  because a local poll shoes that most boys like girls with blond hair.<br>  <br>  me and all my friends dig chicks with blond hair when they have blue eyes like my girlfriend they Look totally hot

Remember, you could make short-shorts, knee shorts or capris at any length.|`|n2MM5T4faa	Make shorts out of them. Instead of buying them like that at stores it can be free~<br>  <br>  Just cut them with some sort of sissers they use for sewing (havn't sewed in a while) and if you want to have fun with it I see alot of people but they're shorts with tiny paint splatters on them. You can use white paint for that too! :)|`|5rXah84Yaa	You can make...<br>  shorts, purse, give them to charity, doodle on them, put cotton in it and swe all the ends so it can be a pillow, and thats all i can think of :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  XxMkloverxX|`|ai33g11Maa	You could make an imaginary friend out of them.  <br>  <br>  Simply....IMAGINE them!<br>  <br>  Or, how about a fish?  - Simply deep-fry.|`|3iB7bnJGaa	I have made cute cut-off shorts with them.<br>  Once I even made a cute bag for my frined with them!|`|CNZn1qhJaa	Shorts...or you could make a skirt or something.|`|76v8JiUqaa	if they fit wear em<br>  if not make a purse|`|eEtLU9OZaa	you can make a purse, shorts, or depending on the condition you can make them into patchwork pants and sell them.|`|xGHCDUT9aa	well if they're loose ones then you can just cut them into shorts or make them into jean bermudas if they're a bit tighter|`|GGSEkPnqaa	rip em up with sandpaper<br>  put diff color paint splatters on them<br>  cut them and fold the cut part up to make shorts<br>  use fabric pens and make designs on them<br>  :)|`|L95x2mcraa	I had an old pair of jeans that were my favorite and I wore all the time.  They started to get holes in the pants, so I turned them into shorts.  I think I love them even more! LOL|`|JqDkLWeTaa	shorts cut off the ends lol|`|wm4R4q3zaa	make them destroyed;; go on youtube and see how;; its real cute.|`|FHi0v36eaa	You could cut them into shorts, just put them on and mark where you want them to be cut with chalk and cut away.<br>  <br>  You could also make a purse. Lay the jeans on a flat surface, mark with chalk where you want them to be cut. Sew the bottom shut, use the leftover fabric for a strap and sew on any old patches for a decoration.|`|AA11746317	You can make them into shorts.|`|oD5y4ivxaa	I make skirts by cutting everythings to the shorts, then tada!<br>  <br>  Help me with mines!<br>  Go to my profile!|`|fyXoVV6daa	short shorts.

00bce1adc90c7c68242b51b75744ad7caa	I was having the same problem with my Morgan when I did a search online and found your question. Here's what I did.  I contacted a local retailer and asked, and this is the information I have.  The insert in the bottom of the Morgan is actually plastic.  Since there is no way to remove it and apparently it feels just like the plastic  inserts inside the cosmetic bags.  It is safe to wash, just make SURE not to dry it in the dryer....LINE DRY!!! Cold water only on the delicate cycle with a very gentle detergent.  I am gonna try it right now, hope it works for you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I washed my bag according to the directions given here, and found it worked splendidly.  FYI It will take at least a day for the Morgan to line dry so be prepared to use another bag for a little while!

r4i7xPnMaa	You can usually just tell them. If you go hang around a counter, eventually someone will come up to you and ask if you need help. At that point, you'd say something like, "Yes, I was interested in picking up a couple things." and go from there. They'll help you pick the things out that you want/need, and then you go pay.     Pretty simple. And I know some of the MAs don't look very approachable, but they're all very very sweet, especially if they know that you're going to buy things.|`|3b4c1d3bd81f17c846a0c8e8d5992d5daa	Just find a color or item that you like and tell them that you want it. Point it out to them.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Just go up to one of the sales girls (or guys) and tell them what product you want. A blush, a lipstick, a lip gloss, a mascara, an eyeshadow, whatever and if you know the color you want, you can tell them that too. But if you find it yourself out on display you can just show it to them and tell them it's what you want. Hope that helps! Good luck!|`|Br3k7Hagaa	I'm so glad you asked this I always wanted to but never did im way shy so im just gonna order of their website. But i think you'd probably tell theem|`|2Urd6VLqaa	Pretty much just point it out and say that's what you want.   Unless they don't have it on display then just ask them (example: "I'm looking to buy a black eyeliner pencil"), and they should be able to find what you are looking for.    It's not like Starbucks where you have to know the lingo LOL    ?|`|SawRVqiCaa	If you're just looking around, you let them know you're looking at first.  Once you have been using a color for awhile, you would just let them know the color that you're getting and what it is: whether it's lipgloss, eye shadow, etc|`|elYiFxMkaa	I just take an item from the display/testers and bring it to the cashier.
E1K685ZNaa	When you color your hair with a different color it will last longer because there are way more pigment things, where as in red hair color there are VERY few. I dye my hair red too and it doesnt last very long. Now i am going to a new hairdresser and she used this stuff that does fade some but so far it has stayed in a good while. If you want to keep my name on here you can send me a message or something and i will let you know what kind it is. But either way red will fade unless its natural|`|7w7Q12fFaa	Certain conditioners have a chemical in it that helps dyed hair stay that way for long...
