20090305084418AAA5xzM	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	How do you find the original account name when someone changes their name on Facebook?	My group on Facebook was "hacked" when it was thriving with just over 182,000 members. The "hackers" are Hezbollah supporters and have not only made themselves admins of my group but they're now changing they're name (Facebook now allows you to do that). So, there is no link to their profile under the admins list (their name is black) and they don't show up under their new name in my members section. This means to remove them I have to search other names and say their original account name was "Steve," then when I search "Steve" their new name (say it's "Bill") will show up for me to remove them.      However, it takes way too long to do this with this many members. I was wondering if anyone knew a quicker, more efficient way? If it is a secret, message me. I just need to know how to discover this person's identity.      Thanks.
20090305084456AAWAsZE	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help me with my java code please?	Can someone answer the following java code for me please?      1. Write a method to compute the average of an int array and return the value as a double. The int array and the number of elements in the array are both passed as parameters to the method in that order.       2. The length operator can be used to control a for-loop that iterates through each element of an array, as in for (int j=0; j<list.length; j++). However, this is not necessarily safe. Why not?       3. Write a method to compute and return the value of max – min where max is the largest element of an int array and min is the smallest element of an int array. The method is passed the int array and an int value that denotes the number of elements in the array. You may assume that the int array has at least 1 element in it.       4. Write code fragment to swap the two Strings stored by variables a and b.       5. The class Name consists of 4 instance data, String title, String first, String middle, String last. The class has a constructor that is passed all 4 String values and initializes the class appropriately, and has 4 methods, each returns one of the four instance data, called returnTitle( ), returnFirst( ), returnMiddle( ) and returnLast( ).       Name[ ] addressBook = new Name[100]; is performed.      Write a method that is passed 4 String parameters corresponding to a Name’s title, first, middle, and last, and finds this Name in addressBook and returns the index of where this Name was found, or –1 if the Name was not found. Assume that addressBook stores n entries (n is an int).

20090305055456AAXiOsV	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java - ArrayLists, Recursion.?	I feel bad constantly asking for help on here and giving back so little to the community. However, my AP Computer Science teacher, is more of a chaperon than a teacher. He gives us assignments in a book (meant for college students), and none of us understand the terminology. I'm a senior in high school, who is barely average in the English language. Could someone explain, in simple terms, ArrayLists and Recursion?      A few things you could inform me of, if you could.      What's this 'mumbo jumbo' about converting variables and array elements "toString" and to and Object. I know how to do it, but why is it necessary?      I've noticed the term "integer" as opposed to "int", and Object[]. Is this because "integer" is a subclass of the Object class?      Parenthesis. Why is it that in all the examples given in this hell-sent book read: System.out.println(((Integer)a[1]).lengt...   (That may not be correct, I'm just giving an example of a LOT of parenthesis being used.      Thank you all very much for your time. If anyone would also like to offer future assistance, you could post your e-mail and i'll shoot you one if I ever have another Java question.

20090305055044AAPdmTs	Computers & Internet;Software	Windows office installer on a continuous loop. I didn't start it, install it, disinstall it.?	I restored some factory settings on internet explorer and restarted my computer. Since I restarted, windows office installer keeps popping up asking me to instert the installation disk (which is about 8 years old and lost) and click next. I click cancel, it says it cannot complete installation and starts again. I've tried closing it in task manager but it's on a loop. Googled this as I think its a virus but cant find anything except for questions on paid sites. Any ideas? It's my computer at work and I will get in big trouble if theres anything amiss when the next shift starts as I am the only one all day with access and I'm not meant to be using the computer. I know if theres a virus I'll be blamed for downloading stuff (which I haven't done. The computer was riddled with viruses but I thought I got them all)   Help meeee!!!

20090305053245AAEcdJy	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	What is the best way to preserve integrity of a file?	I want to burn a couple of .pdf files to DVD. Problem is, previously I've found that over a period of time, the files I had burned had become corrupt - when I burned them they were working fine but four months later acrobat reader refused to open some of them. This of course is because the disk surface may have got scratched, but what I'd like to know is if there is any way to sort of preserve the file burned on the DVD, sort of a recovery module or something, so that if it gets slightly damaged, it can be repaired. There is the md5 checksum, but that only tells whether the file is intact or not, isn't there any other such checksum thing that can be used to repair the data?      Would compressing it with 7zip or making an .iso file help?       I want it for principally for pdf files, but I'd like to know for other file types as well.      Thanks.

Started maybe 2 weeks ago.  I don't know if there was an update or not.  I would watch a video online in either a flash format or divx.  Anywhere from about 5-15 minutes into it, the browser would not respond, I can't shut it down.  Anything else that I try to do (open or close another window, open start menu, CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) would not respond in almost a domino effect.  Shortly after if I wait, my machine will power off hard with no exit screen and start up again.  This has happend multiple times while I was on youtube.com, ninjavideo.net (divx), and viewing videos directly uploaded to Facebook.      Since this has happened, I have:      attempted to update flash   attempted to update video card driver   restore back to previous time   reformatted hadr drive and put fresh copy of windows on   use multiple browsers (firefox, ie, chrome)      It seems that no one knows what the problem is online and that there are a lot of people having this problem.

OK, so i just got home from a 6 month vacation if that's what you wanna call it and when i got back, my girlfriend had to reformat her computer and the router would not allow her to connect to the network. so i reset the router and reset up the network, now it allows her to connect, but it has decided not to allow her sister to connect. there are 3 total computers on this network one is non wireless which is the main computer and the other 2 are wireless. I cannot figure out the problem at all. I guess i cannot say the router won't allow them to connect because she is connected but it is not allowing her to access the internet it gives her a "limited or no connectivity" message. When i do ipconfig to check the ip (on the bad connected comp)  it does not give a dns suffix or a default gateway. Also the ip address starts with 169 instead of 192!       I have talked to comcast and linksys and neither can help.   Any help with this issue will be greatly appreciated thank you!

It has worked in the past (I've had it since Christmas 2008, along with my new PC) and after swapping my monitor's it seems that it isn't the PC's fault. The VGA cable and VGA adapter are also okay.       One thing to note is that before the fault became permanently unfixable, I fiddled around and tried swapping to the 2nd DVI port and then back, which made it work, but now it picks up nothing at all.      I'm using a EVGA GTX280 graphics card   and my monitor is a BAIER Model: 1975 HD LCD TV      Is this a fixable issue? or has the monitor gone bust within warranty?

Well im not good at computers at all! so if im doing anything wrong please just say(: well anyway my Packard bell computer (viseo) sometimes says 'Not connected' when one of the plugs slip out of the socket behind my Monitor. So I normally just place it back in as normal and woolah! there's connection. But yesterday i found that when i did the same thing, it was harder to put the plug in. But eventually I did. I looked back at my screen and my screen was a light blue colour. And now my colours are mixed up and some colours i can't even see. I tried and tried with the plug, but it's as far in as it can go but it keeps slipping out. Iv'e restarted a million times, left it off overnight and today it's still not working! it's frustratingg I can't do anything or not make out something without this colour. I can't see anything loose, can someone tell me what to do? or if they've had this problem. ( I will choose another best answer ) im really in need of this help. Look im not a computer expert, so if you are a sort of good computer... guy^^/woman just please a bit more detail:L hahh(:

Give the running time of the following method.      int indexOf(String big, String small)   {   for (int i = 0 ; i < big.length()-small.length() ; i++)   {   String partOfBig = big.substring(i, i+small.length());   if (partOfBig.equals(small))   {   return i;   }   }      return -1;   }      have no idea for this one. can you help? i suspect is it O(m-n) calls to equals and substring if m= big.length() and n=small.length()

I just need to blow some smoke....I bought a new 24 inch iMac a little over a month ago as well as a Mac Pro for work. I got the iMac upgraded from 2GB to 4GB. I spent roughly $2000 on it. Now what just came out is a newer version with installed 4GB and more HD space and faster processing speed for $1799.    I'm really pissed off because this purchase was an investment and now there is something better and cheaper than what I paid.      I called the store manager where I purchased the Imac and he to come in for further discussion. He also said I could not return it because it was 'customized.'      I am still furious and right now I'm venting. Anyone have tips on what I should say? Ultimately I really want the new one.....heh!

I put in an old 800x GTO card I had laying around and it worked fine. Now, the new power supply has no pcix connector. The only adapter I have came with the x800 and has only 3 or 4 wires to the 6 pin plug. Could that be it? Thanks

20090305093323AAkLnGu	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	What to do about this computer virus?	Ok, so first, my symptoms:      All of a sudden, thousands of internet explorer windows will pop up of which ever page I was most recently on. They open over and over again and trying to close them doesn't help. They just keep coming. So, I close explorer in task manager and it stops. This has happened a few times now.      Just today, yahoo messenger was doing that thing where it tells you that you've been signed out because you've been signed in on another computer. I think it's maybe doing it so I'll put in my password for it to log.      I suspect I picked this up from facebook by the way - it happened for the first time when I looked at a new friend of mine's page.      Anyway, i have Norton 360 - fully updated. I've done a full scan with this - it sorted a few things.      I also downloaded ad aware and did a full scan - it sorted a couple of things.      However, funny things are still happening, so I downloaded the free trial of trojan hunter, which found nothing.       So now haha, I'm having a go with windows defender.      I'm on Vista by the way.      So... any other ideas? I really can't be bothered to format. It's a hassle. Does anyone know what thie virus might be or what it could be called?

About a month back i was on Windows Live Messenger 9.0 and a friend of mine gave me a link to something, thinking it was harmless i clicked it and it came up saying "virus" or something like that, so i scanned my computer with AVG 8.0 and everything SEEMED fine. A few weeks later, things started to play up again, my desktop background changes and it said "your computer has a serious spyware problem".. so i scaned my computer again using AVG and it found a whole load of Trojan Horse devices. Thinking that id solved it again,, about 2 days ago, every website i visited had on the top of the page:      "18 trojans on your computer"   "your computer is virus infected" EVERY WEBSITE inc. Yahoo Answers      People told me to try several programmes such as: Spyware Doctor, Malware: Antie Malware etc.. so i did and it found a total of 11 threats and 200 infections which AVG did not find. But, i found out that after the scan i had to purchase it, now i already spent quite a few pounds on AVG and do not want to spend more...      can someone out there PLEASE help me here and DO NOT give me recommendations to programmes that ask me to pay at the end       PLEASE HELP!

20090305095236AAVBroD	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	What can I do to save my computer?	Alright, well it seems that I have gotten in a little over my head trying to remove Vista from my system, because I think I killed my computer. I spent a long time trying to partition my hard drive because gateway told me that if I took Vista off, it would void my warranty. Eventually the device manager stopped showing my hard drives in the storage. I talked to gateway again, and they told me the warranty on my software was up, so I decided to get rid of Vista all together. Little did I know that Vista is immortal. I tried installing XP for the longest time before I realized that the XP disk didn't have a driver for SATA hard drives, so I found out how to stick the drivers in the  installation disk. I did that, put it in the computer, and it destroyed my boot functions. Now if I try to load windows, it just has a flashing prompt line in the corner that does nothing. I have tried using different XP CDs, repairing it with a Vista Restore Disk, and loading the different operating systems off of a USB drive, and nothing works. There are no restore points, no backup information, and no restore partition anymore (because me and my infinite wisdom decided to format it for more disk space). I just realized that the USB drive that I was using was formatted in RAW, so I'm formatting it in FAT32 now. Do I need to give in and take it to be repaired, or is there any hope of saving it (preferably with XP on it)?

20090305064526AABO9qU	Computers & Internet;Software	Is there a Win32 API call to ascertain what drives user has on his PC?	Is there a Win32 API call to ascertain what drives user has on his PC?      I am a Visual Foxpro Programmer. I have understood lately that Windows API calls can be given using Visual Foxpro 9.0 Professional Edition.      Is there a Visual Foxpro programmer using VFP 9.0 Professional Edition in this forum or elsewhere on the net (whom u know) who has good knowledge of Visual Foxpro as well as Win32 API and who could help me?      I wish to know what is the small VFP program (function) I have to write in Visual Foxpro such that my program will understand what are the various drives that are present on the user's PC (without physically accessing those drives)      What I mean by physically accessing is ->  For example if I give command SET DEFA TO E:\ (believing that Foxpro will give an error to me 'Invalid Path" if this drive doesn't exists on my PC I found two problems here:      Problem # 1: My computer doesn't have A:\ drive (that is floppy). But when I gave SET DEFA TO A:\ nothing happened for a while and then Windows gave its own message "Drive Not Ready" with three command buttons "Cancel; Try Again; Continue" and then if I pressed Cancel in Windows Error Dialog I was shown by Foxpro Invalid Path. Which means Foxpro or Windows actually physically tried to access the drive.       What I want is internally some Windows command should tell me whether a particular drive is present on users PC. For example suppose there is a Windows call   isdrivexists("A:") where A: Drive letter is passed as parameter then that Windows call will return some value which will tell me whether A:\ exists on users PC or not. So physically that drive is not accessed (and so no error "Drive Not Ready" is generated and flashed in a window by Windows). But internally I get to know that A: doesn't exist.      Problem # 2: My computer has DVD RW drive. But when I gave SET DEFA D:\ (which is DVD RW) Foxpro gave me error "Invalid drive". So immediately I understood that SET DEFA TO >>drive letter>> is useless to ascertain what drives are present on user's computers. Because in this case athough D:\ existed on my PC Foxpro gave me "Invalid drive or path" error (just because it didn't find a DVD in that drive). Now, while I am checking which drives exists the user may not be having a DVD put into his DVD Writer and so foxpro will return "Invalid drive or path" (so this SET DEFA TO command is not good to detect whether a drive exists on a user's PC).      Basically, In my Foxpro program I wish to show Drive Letters of Valid drives that are present on user's PC. So if some user has C:\ and D:\ but doesn't have A:\ then only C:\ and D:\ will be shown in drop box list. Got It!      For that I need a Windows call to internally ascertain what drives are present on user's PC. And I wish to know how to use that call from within Foxpro. So only a person who knows both Foxpro as well as Windows programming can tell me how to go about it.      Thanks & Regards,      Anita Mallya.

20090305100812AA63DP4	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help me with my java code please?	Can someone answer the following java code for me please?      I read the chapter and i have no idea how to write the code for the following questions.      If you can help me with would be great. Thank you and have a nice day.      1. Write a method to compute the average of an int array and return the value as a double. The int array and the number of elements in the array are both passed as parameters to the method in that order.       2. The length operator can be used to control a for-loop that iterates through each element of an array, as in for (int j=0; j<list.length; j++). However, this is not necessarily safe. Why not?       3. Write a method to compute and return the value of max – min where max is the largest element of an int array and min is the smallest element of an int array. The method is passed the int array and an int value that denotes the number of elements in the array. You may assume that the int array has at least 1 element in it.       4. Write code fragment to swap the two Strings stored by variables a and b.       5. The class Name consists of 4 instance data, String title, String first, String middle, String last. The class has a constructor that is passed all 4 String values and initializes the class appropriately, and has 4 methods, each returns one of the four instance data, called returnTitle( ), returnFirst( ), returnMiddle( ) and returnLast( ).       Name[ ] addressBook = new Name[100]; is performed.      Write a method that is passed 4 String parameters corresponding to a Name’s title, first, middle, and last, and finds this Name in addressBook and returns the index of where this Name was found, or –1 if the Name was not found. Assume that addressBook stores n entries (n is an int).   1 hour ago - 4 days left to answer.

I purchased a 3.5mm jack - RCA audio cable and have connected that from my pc to the component audio on my tv. However, due to the own HDMI audio when displaying on that channel it disables the audio of the component. Is there anyway to disable the HDMI audio so it will not do so?

20090227063047AAlC2nE	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How do you put internet data into an image (updates regularly) so that it can be used as a forum signature?	In forums, I often see people with signatures that show game statistics. For example, if its a war game it shows their account name, then how many wins or kills they have, and 5-6 other things about their character. Sometimes they're click-able, and they take you to a site where you can input your account name for that game, and it generates a signature for you for that game.       So I'm wondering, how do you do that? One of my favorite games doesn't have anything like that, and I would like to try making one for me and my friends. Is it HTML based, or something with the image itself, or what?
