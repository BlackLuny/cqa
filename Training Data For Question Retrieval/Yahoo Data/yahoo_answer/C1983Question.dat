20090227080914AAsnkQa	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Other - Games & Gear	Why, when things are released in America, do they take so long to be released in England?	Any games I've ever waited for, any TV show that I had to wait to come out, they've always been out in America first. And that's fair enough, since they're created in America, or at least nearer to America, but they usually take over half a year to even get into England!   It's the most frustrating thing ever, especially if it's a game or console, because they're not compatable with English technology.       And if it's due to this, that it takes so long, why can't the technology compatability all be the same?      It's so annoying!

20070305191113AAK0KSi	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	So I dropped my digital camera in the mud...(broken shutter?)?	...in a pig pen. And I didn't realise it till about 15 minutes later, after it had been mashed into the ground. When I found it again, I brushed the mud off--to my surprise, it still turned on when I pushed the power button. However, when I go to take a picture now, it seems like its going to work--but the shutter inside never clicks, I think, because it like freezes with a black screen and then eventually shows a whited out picture (like its over exposed). I was just wondering if this sounded fixable, if other people had broken their shutters (if you think that that is what this sounds like) how much theirs had cost to have fized, or if anyone miraculously had some quick fix advice.
