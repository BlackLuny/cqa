20090304103904AAlWC72	Travel;United States;Other - United States	My wife and I are looking to go to the outer banks this summer.  Which City/town is best for us?	We've stayed in Kitty Hawk 2 times before, and loved it.  The only problem was there wasnt much to do that didnt require a long drive.      Were looking for some place that has the seclusion and peace and quiet of Kitty Hawk but with more things to do closer by (restaurants, nightlife, activities, boardwalk?).  We're not big shoppers, so nightlife is a plus (not big clubbers, but we really like live music, active recreation, and cool bars).  We want to avoid over commercialization like Myrtle beach.  We also want to stay within a walk of the beach (or on it).  When we stayed at Kitty Hawk all we had to do was cross the street and there was the beach!      I dont know if there is a town/city that fits this criteria, so any insight would help!  Thanks so much!

20090227065249AA3XTRL	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	Which of these trips do Canadians like the best?	Trip #1:  Fly to Whitehorse or Anchorage, AK.   Then drive to Dawson City, Yukon Territory and take Dempster Highway to Inuvuk, crossing north of the arctic circle. Then wind back south into BC and visit Rupert Island.      Trip #2: Drive from New England into New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland.  And spend a good amount of time in Peggy's Cove, Cape Breton, and St. Johns and Labrador.      Trip #3: Start in Ottawa, drive north passing through Motogami, Quebec and then drive the high speed motorcycle route to James Bay (no speeding tickets on this road because radars don't work, people often drive 200 km/h on this road but if you get stuck, it's a bit nerve-wrecking.)  From James Bay, attempt a canoe to Cape Dorset, Nunavut if possible to avoid exorbitant airfare.      Which is most fascinating to Canadians???

Answerers first and foremost      Are you getting news and local promotions for the Upcoming "George W. Bush Tour - - Conversation with the retired U.S. President" ?      10 points for best answer      Former President George W. Bush will embark next month on a series of speeches that will take him to Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. The former president already has plans for about 10 speeches over the next year, and will do more. An offering for speeches went up on the Washington Speakers Bureau website on Jan. 29, the week after he left the White House. The first speech will be March 17 in Calgary, Alberta. The Canadian event, to be held in a convention center before a largely business audience, is being promoted as 'A conversation with George W. Bush,' and is scheduled to last from noon to 2 p.m. It is closed to the press. 'President during a period of great consequence, George W. Bush shares thoughts on his eight momentous years in the Oval Office and discusses the challenges facing the world in the 21st century,' the brochure says.       from Politico dot-com (Mike Allen's Politico Playbook Feb. 24)

20090304115416AA86ijC	Travel;United States;Other - United States	While I am away should I surprise my hubby with a greyhound trip to his only sister's place?sound ok or cheesy?	Here's the thing I am going to be away for a month abroad visiting family. Hubby and I live 12 hrs by bus away from my sis in law. She had a baby recently and we DID go to see the baby in Nov but only for 2 days. Hubby will be alone here. Why I am thinking about surprising him with 3 days weekend to his sis's place by bus is 2 reasons.      I am frightened of planes especially after the recent disasters and more than that the money--its 400 per person to her place for a 3 day trip. Hubbys cousins are gonna show up there too, so it would be nice bonding for the 4 of them.   My only problem is will greyhound look cheesy for a surprise. I mean 10-12 hr trip mostly overnight could tire him terribly. He will be very happy to see his sis, cousins and the new nephew but I am worried he will wonder why I couldnt just pay 400 for the plane. The greyhound is of course much cheaper---only 150 for the round trip so I save 250 that way.   What should I do?

Only problem is, we don't know where to go!   There are 16 of us and this is obviously a large number of people to book in one go! We have criteria, but we don't know where the best place to go is that fits them all!      * Cheap. We have a budget of approx. ￡250-300 each   * Hot. We want somewhere that will have nice weather. No point paying for rain when we've got that here in England!   * Europe. We obviously can't afford longer flights with our budget.   * Beaches. We'll be 18 by then, and a beach is a neccesity for us!   * Sports. Even if it's just banana boats and stuff, we need something exciting!   * Food. We have one nut allergy, 4/5 veggies, one fish hater etc. we need somewhere with a fair bit of variety so we can all eat at the same place rather than everyone choosing different restaurants and eating on our todds.   * Accomodation. This can't be too expensive, we are on low budgets.   * Pool. Wherever it is the accomodation needs a swimming pool! A very important requirement!   * No camping, skiing, snowboarding.      I think thats everything! If you can help it would really be appreciated! We are totally and utterly stuck, none of us have ever organised a holiday before!

This way we can have Sat, Sun, and Monday morning.   2. Maybe it's better we go stayover in Santa Fe on Sat night and Albuquerque on Sunday night so there is no rush to catch our flight back home on Monday afternoon.   3. I heard about Hotel Santa Fe and Hacienda. Are they good? Which one is nicer? Any other hotel recommendation similar to this level?   4. Pls provide must-go-places for both places. No zoo, theme park or etc. My parents travel a lot so they like to see something new and interesting. Special scenery/architect would be nice.   5. Any special gourmet/restaurants we must try? Don't have to be high-end places. We like holes-in-the-wall as long as they are special and cannot be found somewhere else      What is the weather like in early May? Let me know if I didn't provide enough info about what we need. Thanks advance for your help!

20090304112201AAtpZCx	Travel;Canada;St. John's	Looking to move away, wondering about costs?	I'm looking at the prices for moving away from Newfoundland to Ottawa.. My boyfriend and I would be flying and already have our tickets taken care of. Im just wondering about other prices.. like how much it would be to take our dog and rabbit? How much would it be to get all of our furniture up? we don't have a whole lot of BIG stuff, a bed, futon, desk and weight bench are our biggest things. If someone could share some experiences, or give me some estimates or even websites to look at it would be a great help.
