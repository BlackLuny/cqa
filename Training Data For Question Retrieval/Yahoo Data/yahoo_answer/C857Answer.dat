C7Mfo0soaa	These calcs are all a little wacky.  Your correct answer is 0.|`|gM8MUde7aa	As long as you always pay those balances, then your credit card payment totals are, in fact, zero. The payment amount will also show up as zero on your credit report. However, this only happens if you make your payment before the billing cycle ends. Otherwise, once the bill comes out... you have a minimum payment, even if you choose to pay ALL of it.  Your credit report WILL occasionally show the balance on the credit card as well, such as... lets say you charged a $1400 sofa, and paid it a week later but before the billing period ends. If the Credit Bureau snapshots your account during that week, you'll show a $1400 balance but no minimum payment.    Keep in mind, that even if you pay your cards off every month... the fact that your balance still shows up sometimes, can impact your debt/income ratio, which is yet another factor in trying to secure financing for a house.    To answer your question, if you pay your cards in full BEFORE the bill gets sent to you, the bill should reflect no balance and no payment due. If you pay in full after you get the bill, you'll still technically have a "minimum payment". You'll want to add those up to determine the number to use.

Your friend has no right to use the basement unless she actually "rents" the basement...or her lease states that she can use the basement for storage.    3.  A lease is between the occupant and owner of a property.  Your friends boyfriend is neither...and has no legal right to live there without the landlords permission.  The $50.00 a month more is likely for the additional wear and tear an extra occupant will put on the property.  BTW...I'm sure your friends lease does NOT state that she can move in whom ever she please either.|`|tDC896Ubaa	Unless there is something in the lease saying the number of people who can live there the landlord can't raise the rent...the only time I've seen something in a lease like that is when it is all-inclusive rent (I don't do it).  What the landlord is called a "slumlord," landlords need to fix things that are at no fault of the tenant and has an affect of their living conditions.  Call the city/town building inspector and let them know.  If it is as bad as you make it sound the landlord will be forced to fix it up and will probably get fined.  Check this out http://definitions.uslegal.com/s/slumlor...

4VsUKjQGaa	There are two sets of rules for claiming a dependent.  They are 1) qualifying child, and 2) qualifying relative.  Here are the rules:    Qualifying child:  a) Be your child (or sibling or their descendent)  b) Live with you more than half the year (except for temporary absence--like school)  c) Have provided less than half their own support  d) Be under age 24 and a full-time student for at least 5 months (or under 19, or permanently and totally disabled)    Qualifying relatiave:  a)  Be your relations (closer than cousin) or lived with you all year;  b)  Earn less than $3,500;  c)  YOU must have provided more than half his support.    For either case, the person must be a citizen (or resident of the U.S., Canada or Mexico).    So, if she's a student who lived with your mom, there is no income limit, but she can't provide more than half her own support.  If she's not a student or didn't live with your mom, then the income limit is $3,500.|`|a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	If she is full time student and did not pay more than half of her expenses, then your mother may be able to claim her as qualifying child.

egA9noHvaa	People just want to claim they have a degree instead of actually going further in school to get that degree.  Of course getting a certificate of any kind or being a CNA (which my mother is) is not having a degree.  Nowadays, even having an Associate's degree is like not having a degree since things are so competitive and are getting more and more competitive with each passing year.    But mostly I think people see the BA. degree and higher as the respected degree offered by an "accredited" (this is very important) college or university. If a school (or program) is not accredited by one of the regional accreditation councils, to most people (including employers), they have not earned a degree.       Regional Accreditation Councils in the U.S.:         The United States is divided into eight regions, each one having an accreditation body which is recognized by the United States Department of Education.  Universities and colleges use this system to transfer courses taken at one institution to another.  The councils also use this system to assure the institution has knowledgeable faculty and their programs have rigor.       For a list of the councils, go to: http://www.elearners.com/resources/agenc...|`|D9k5Fou5aa	I think ppl just say whatever. There are technical schools that claim to offer bachelor's degrees. They're not the same as your average 4 yr college/university, but I guess they can claim it since they're in a different part of the industry?? I also hear ppl say they got a degree, but it's an associate degree. Nowadays, when ppl say degree, they mean bachelor's degree. Technically, they are right to say they got a degree, but nobody thinks it.

Also, the ink should be raised and look very carefully at the small details in the bill (specifically the lines on the face) to see if they are smudged or blurred. Also, the paper should have fibres (like small, dark hairs) in it.    Usually, if it is just a one dollar bill it isn't fake because it wouldn't be worth the money to print. If it is a larger bill, these tips should help.    Additionally, if it is a $100 bill, you can hold it up to a light and see an image of Benjamine Franklin in the paper (known as a watermark) that you can't otherwise see.

If not then IRS is holding the refund, and you will receive a letter.   Did you report all your w2/1099's, did you have the actual w2's 1099;s when you filed or did you use your last pay stub?    At this time it is a good idea for you to make changes on your W4 and raise the amount of exemptions so that you would be due a refund next year.  Make changes to you W4 and give to your employer so they can takes less taxes out (just enough where you won't owe either).  Visit IRS website:  www.irs.gov and use the withholding calculator.  and download W4 withholding and provide it to your employer.

It earns you spending cash and gas money till you start making sales.  2. It helps you to generate leads on possible properties that may be going on the market in the near future.  3. You could get a listing from the company that orders the BPO.    I have just started completing BPO's and have completed 5 for this company this week: Residential Values, Inc. www.resvalues.com    Haven't been paid yet, so don't know how long it takes to get paid and that is something that I hear makes a lot of difference in the companies. They say that they pay fast, we will see?    Good luck and I love the business, couldn't imagine myself doing anything else.    Larry

Ch9TedMcaa	A stock trend is the direction a company's stock is going on a regular basis.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	Just put on a moving average and you'll be fine    A lot of the theory candle patterns don't work.  The one that does is the bullish 'N" pattern or the reversed bearish pattern of it, so keep an eye out for them.      The dominant white candle supported by high volume is another one to keep a look for.    Don't get too worried about candles, just focus on the overall price  trend.|`|2417db90546c11b72d117dcac702c229aa	I think simply a trend is just a direction for a certain time period.  Can be long or short.

2yl8omcAaa	It is really depends. If you are planning to stay longer than 5 yrs on a house. I'd say buy a house/town house.     If you guys planning to move within a year or two then renting is the best idea for you. No need to worry on repairs, taxes, insurance....|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No a 300k loan would be around 3000 a month|`|2sXqm4u9aa	I am assuming you are from England, i.e., the "fortnight"  You really need to research this out and not assume anything.  You know how much income you have and how much you can afford for rent.  If your credit rating is excellent then you will get a better interest rate.  My daughter bought a home (brand new) for $180,000 in 2000 and her note on house if $1,600.00 a months which includes taxes and insurance for the year.  Granted, a home is an investment, but if you cannot pay for it even if it is only a few hundred difference, it can become a noose around your neck where you are living and working only to pay the note and that's not good either.  You need to actually apply for a loan or talk to a mortgage company tell them what you are trying to do and see what you get.  Research it out - a few hundred sometimes means whether or not you eat from week to week.|`|jgq7Tsuuaa	In this case, I disagree with Worldy2, as typically for a 100,000 loan if your interest rate is 6% you can figure that the payment will be right around the $600 per month level, so triple that and you would have $1800, but don't forget the taxes and insurance, which I have added into my loan and like it that way much better, as it is paid monthly as opposed to getting two large bills on top of the monthly house payment.    You sound like you could be english or from some other country other than the USA, if so, it could well be different there depending on where you live.|`|cxrMqCzRaa	You are right on the dead money thing... why pay someone Else's mortgage if you can afford to buy and pay your own. If you can find a house that you can afford then I'd go ahead, shop around and if you haven't used your first home buyers grant then start buy seeing an accountant about pre-approval so you know what you can look for and if Keystart or other first home buyer lenders will suit you =)   ... remember to take into account though, that at the moment intersest rates are low and not only will you have trouble getting money but also what you may be able to afford now may be out of you budget when interest rates go back up.  Dont base your amount on the interest rates as they are, look at an average percentage that they may go back up to.  Otherwise you could get yourself in trouble and not be able to affors the repayments in the long run! and remember you dont have to spend as much as they tell you, you can borrow!  paying for a house that is 'yours' is alot nicer! =) good luck and happy hunting!!

AA12155452	The problem is that you have acknowledged and admitted the debt by making regular payments to date and you would therefore be expected to continue to do so.  I mean, you do actually owe this money.  The fact remains that interest is frozen and one day you will be the proud owner of a zero balance.  It's worth the punt ...|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	Yes|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Sure do.|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Yeh, you've got confused with what Statute Barred is.    If you succesfully run/hide for a debt for 6 continuous years without making a payment or acknowledging it then the debt is no longer enforcable (although you still owe it)|`|vcF2iiJdaa	Yes, you do.  The reason being you are in contact with the company.  A company are not *supposed* to chase you for payment after 6 years with no contact has passed.  BUT because you have been making payments, you are acknowledging that you owe the money and are still liable.|`|20lCgb6Uaa	Not if you are in the UK. Contact www.bdebtfree.info and they will arrange to get it legally cancelled.|`|a0378764c21ad86aee499ed125d372d9aa	Ignore the answer about getting the debt cancelled. As everybody else has already said, because you have been making payments, you have admitted that you owe the money. If it had been six years or over and you hadnt made a payment in that time, you could have claimed under the Limitation Act that the debt was statute  barred. As far as I know, you cant get the debt cancelled unless you have specific grounds to do so. If you decide to try the company mentioned, ask how much they will charge you for this.|`|AA11908567	You borrowed it, so you pay it back.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	yes, as you have acknowledged the debt...if you had ignored it and got away with it for 6 years , you would have had to pay nothing.

iOqmoIrcaa	If you go into the help section on Paypal, it explains everything.  Basically, it's an online credit card, but the credit line is your checking account.  It costs nothing to send money, but if someone sends you money, they take a small percentage, approximately 3%.  You make a payment, and Paypal takes the money from your checking account to pay the bill.  You get a receipt e mailed to you.|`|N9dBpcWLaa	You make an account and they'll ask you for your credit car information.

O8qdCBzLaa	Yeah, I think the rule of thumb is around 30 - 40% of your gross income is the acceptable maximum for a mortgage. I also think they threw $2700 in there to confuse you, because you may be thinking "Oh, $2700 is about 35%. That must be the right answer." But, that would be wrong combined with the initial $1100. And, $1100 plus $1600 equals $2700, or 36%.|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	I think it is D...    Licensed Real Estate Salesperson in MI

AA10144492	You wouldn't copyright it. Copyrights can be obtained for things of an artistic nature. This includes, of course, poetry, films, sculptures, music, fiction, etc. But can also include things that may not necessarily seem "artistic" in the general sense of the word. Copyrights can also be obtained for advertising copy, games, software programs and blueprints, to name just a few.     To protect a business name within your industry, you would apply for a trademark.    Trademarks can be names of products or services, logos, slogans, packaging and even sounds and smells. In essence, a trademark can be almost anything that is used to identify a particular product or service. Registering a trademark grants the owner exclusive rights to the mark within the specified industry.     Of course, it's necessary to research the mark comprehensively prior to filing to ensure that there is no possibility of infringing upon another party.     This entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark.     To register a trademark, that's done either through your Secretary of State for a State trademark or the US Patent & Trademark Office for a Federal trademark.     If you are only conducting business in one state, then a State trademark is most appropriate. If you conduct (OR are planning to conduct) business in at least 2 states OR between the US & any other country, you can file for a Federal trademark.    Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!|`|w21Afxceaa	copyright is not applicable you need to know that the business has trademark registration which can be search in your country's Intellectual Property Office. that the thing that the can sue you regarding to business trade name.

This group should be related to your product and/or your company. The more interesting the group, the more buzz it will get.

OacSIfSiaa	Your state's tax law for canceled debts may differ from that of federal tax law. Consult a tax professional, e.g. an accountant or attorney, to confirm your state's tax law about reporting canceled debts as taxable income.    A creditor is allowed to submit a 1099-C if they feel the debt is noncollectable and simply charges off the debt.    You can however, send them a written request for validation of this debt.  Send it certified mail/return receipt.  In your request you should ask for and receive the following:    Proof that they own the debt legally or have been legally authorized to collect it from you.   A complete payment history documented from your original creditor. This requirement was established by the case Fields v. Wilber Law Firm, Donald L. Wilber and Kenneth Wilber, USCA-02-C-0072, 7th Circuit Court, Sept 2004.   A copy of the original loan contract that you signed with your creditor.    If they fail to validate this debt, then you should provide documented proof that the debt is unvalidated and that the 1099-C was illegally issued to you.  You may need the help of an accredited income tax agent.    Hope this helps answer your question.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	yes they can -- you in turn can and should write back and seek validation!!!

Pjm9pg7iaa	I asked Wells Fargo. They said that you can have a checking account and a debit card at any age. But if you are under 18, your parents have to be on the account.  Many banks do not have a minimum balance, but you must be careful. They can charge you fees which eat up your money. It is smart to get an account with a minimum balance but pay no fees. With today's low interest rates, banks make much of their profit on the fees..|`|cB3AsABcaa	I would check out a local credit union.  Sometimes they have programs for minors with jobs.  The local one where I live has a completely free account if you also have a savings account with them.    No matter what, do some comparison shopping before picking one.|`|VvURGq2Raa	all banks are 18 and older. you can get your parents to open a joint account with you if your a minor|`|tZ36uSmiaa	I would check out a credit union. They typically have free checking accounts. Some of them even pay interest. You do have to be 18 to open an account on your own but you can open a joint account with someone who is over 18 and reap the same rewards.  Just a couple things to keep in mind    KEEP A CHECK REGISTER! Please! Failing to do so can result in hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees.    A good idea would be to also open a savings account to use as overdraft protection.     Be aware of check hold policies.    Do not draw your account negative. In the event you do, you are responsible for paying it back. The financial institution reserves the right to close your account if it happens frequently or in large amounts. If this happens it will be extremely difficult for you to get another checking account anywhere else for a period of up to a year and you are still responsible for paying the money back.    Good luck!

Ch9TedMcaa	Here is a pretty good explanation. I think it will tell you what you're looking for.    http://economics.about.com/cs/macrohelp/...|`|WgT5l14baa	Nominal is the stated rate.  Real is the nominal rate minus the rate of inflation.  In periods of high inflation and low rates you can actually have a negative real rate.
WTf0caplaa	Always change your resume to suit the job you are applying for.     For instance, with a restaurant job be sure to put down all previous customer service experience you have had. Whether it be from other restaurants, or other work where you had to deal with people.    There should be three main sections: education, relevant experience, and extra details (such as hobbies, sports, etc). Although education may not be as vital a factor for being waitress, a high GPA would show you are a hard worked and quick learner. Be careful with the "extra details" though, you don't want the employer to think you'll be too busy playing sports instead of working.

UeLigNB0aa	I emailed you because the title fees look high to me so I'm verifying with a national title company but I need to know what county you're in.  The big thing to me is that the numbers did not make sense on your first post so I am going to build a GFE for you to show how your earnest money deposit affects how much you have to bring to closing. The other thing I question is if they are using seller concessions to offset the closing costs.    Edit: Ok the title fees are a little high but not by much. The GFE is just an initial estimate so the fees may go up. For example the title company sent you a separate estimate for their fees. You should compare it to the GFE and realize that your fees will be whatever the title company sent you. Everything else looks normal except there is no charge listed for underwriting or processing but other than that it all looks good.

OacSIfSiaa	I can not answer this as I have had no dealings with them, but have heard from others that they are not all that great.  If you "google" them you will see other sites where people are not happy with them    But like all those that state they can repair your credit, lower your bills and reduce interest, many are scams.  Here are some signs to watch for:    1. Credit repair companies advertise directly to consumers on the radio, the Internet and on telephone poles!   2. They claim they can quickly fix your credit situation, no matter how atrocious it really is. These grandiose claims are one of the signs to watch out for.   3. If a company asks you to pay for credit repair services up front, that's a bad omen, indeed, because it's illegal.   4. Credit repair companies often discourage you from contacting the credit bureaus directly.   5. If somebody suggests that you apply for an employer identification number and use that instead of your Social Security number when you apply for credit, that's a telltale sign of fraud.   6. Credit repair scammers may advise you to dispute all the information in your credit report, even entries you know are true.     Hope this is of some help|`|EzrdyxAiaa	yes i have heard of them here on answers and i have never heard any good things about them!!!|`|ca728c1d5770c7b15234aad8216fe981aa	here are a few things to look for when looking for a credit repair company (reference taken from the FTC credit repair organizations act)    if you are not happy with your decision BY LAW you have a 3 day right of recision, if they have broken any laws in their contract you can also get out of it, if you want to send my their agreement (with out your info) I will gladly look over it and can better advise you. If you did not sign an agreement it is also a violation of the below referenced bill which i can also send you or you can view on ftc.gov    SEC. 404.

rrp9c2tnaa	Back surgery by a neurologist will cost far more than $5000.  As for your other questions, the best thing is to call the patient representative for whatever insurance you have and explain the situation to them.  Only they can say if or how much they would pay.
1cFUXQuRaa	When you have 2 sets of data of different periods/ same period but different level of activity then use the high-low method to get the FC & VC.    Now, total cost for 4,480 is 579,400 while for 5,400 is 691,777. Variance between the 2s are 920 quantity & 112,377$. Divide this & you get 122.15 as your VC/ unit. Put this amount into any equation (TC = FC + VC) & you will get your FC = 32,173    Cheers...

aZnAHgJSaa	You can't do that directly on the gift cards.    You could use the $25 card, however, to purchase the $30 one, and pay the difference by another means.    If you're using prepaid credit cards, though - I'd strongly recommend that you get one of the non-gift card ones, such as Nexwave Titanium Plus in Canada, or RushCard in the US. A lot easier to load, and deal with in general, as opposed to prepaid gift cards.    Only difference is, you have to pay a monthly/per transaction fee. I guess it kind of balances out with the service charge you have to pay on top of the card's balance.
KOcwI41Iaa	After you graduate from nursing school, after you are accepted as a neonatal nurse, you will get a course in how to be a junior neonatal nurse.  Once the course is over, you will get a certain amount of time on the unit training with a nursing mentor who will help you become more and more independent.  After the course and orientation are done, then you will be assigned your own patients, starting with the most stable and as your experience grows, going on to taking care of more and more difficult ones.  All in all, it takes about a year to start to get your feet underneath you.  You can also take online continuing education classes, do various nursing magazine continuing education and then there are places such as Anderson's which can send you a huge course on what you are interested in to also get you moving on the continuing ed hours.  They don't do you much good if you haven't passed your Boards, though....

blC1U6LFaa	Technically it is illegal to borrow your down payment.  On your  loan application, one of the declarations you sign states that you are not borrowing any part of the down payment.    You and I both know that shady mortgage brokers will find their way around that problem for you, so that is a non issue I guess.    Best bet would be to borrow it from a source that doesn't show up on your credit report, like a friend or family member.  If you take out a loan, or do a cash advance on a credit card, you may mess up your debt to income ratio.    Once again, shady mortgage brokers will find their way around that as well by opening a new account and getting the mortgage finalized before the new trade line shows up on your credit.
Ch9TedMcaa	Hmmm.........no help there. I agree with you. This man is worth $56 billion. I don't see bad businessman there.|`|ww12lItvaa	I agree he is a very good businessman.     The only thing I can think of, maybe, is that he is a "value" investor and only invests when the prices of a company are low.     When we are in a growth type of economy and prices tend to be higher he doesn't invest and accumulates too much cash because he can't find anything at a low price. (He has said this).    Also he never sells high and fails to take advantage of times when his companies and the stocks he owns are overpriced.     He operates by very narrow rules that work well in the long term but sometimes fail in the short term.     For instance he invested in GE when the stock price was twice as high as it is now. He sees it as a very good long term investment and I agree but at the moment the stock warrants (like an option) that he got for his investment are currently worthless and it may be a very long time before the stock price rises to where they are at a profit.|`|ijZmJXggaa	ive read a great deal on buffett, and your best bet is to talk about his company, Berkshire Hathaway, and the industry it began in.    This is what buffett considers as one of his biggest mistakes in his career, and staying in the textile industry in the 70's did not help him grow his company.  Once he shut down his textile mills, his company took off and is now worth a ridiculous sum of money.    But yeah, research his textile industry shortfalls and problems in the late 1970's.    these are his letters to his shareholders. look at the 1977 report at the top  http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters...    if you want more help, i dunno what to tell you. textiles are probably his only major problem in the last 30 years haha|`|731762ff5b663deba6422ffbee7b6ebcaa	Interesting assignment.  I think you should read up on the guy and something will occur to you as you learn more about him.|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	one point you could possibly make is that the share prices for Berkshire Hathaway has ranged from anywhere from $80,000-$140,000/share.  If he allowed the shares to splite several times and made them worth a few thousand shares a peice, he would get more investors involved, which should in theory raise the shares prices.    Kind of grasping at straws a little...the guy is the most successful investor or all time.  He has mentioned that he's a terrible business man and that his partner is typically the better business man on most deals though.

The judge is already overwhelmed with paperwork and will not be willing to help you. The one thing Congress is debating is whether the BK judge should be allowed to lower your loan balance. If so, the judge would change your current loan from $250,000 to $150,000 with one signature. Then you would have no need to refinance, the judge would do it for you.

NcFWcO3Laa	Maybe  Did the seller give you a Transfer Disclosure Statement before closing?  Did the seller discloses any problems with the A/C?  Did you have an home inspection done?  Did you purchase a home warranty?    Not getting a warranty and inspection is being pennywise and dollar foolish.    If the home had a A/C that was replaced it might not have needed a permit depending on your location.  How old is the A/C system?  Who installed the system?    I would be having an attorney contacting both RE brokers (buyer and seller), the warranty company, the seller, and home inspector and possible the A/C contractor that installed the system.  Ask neighbors if they know if the previous owner had any problems with the A/C in the past.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	Seems to me that if a home inspection was done prior to the purchase, then this whole situation could have been avoided.  Look in your purchase agreement - was the fact that the HVAC system was installed without a permit disclosed?  When was it installed - immediately prior to your purchase, or years earlier?  They obviously knew they didn't get a permit & if they failed to disclose that, then yes - they can be held responsible due to non-disclosure.  I would get more than one opinion on the condition of the system before replacing the whole thing and be prepared to have as much proof as possible before going to court.|`|6LPeWXYuaa	Was a new HVAC part of your purchase contract?  Do you have a copy of the receipt showing the unit was installed and a warranty for the unit and the installation?  Why do you say it is not up to code?  Is it less than 12 SEER?    If so, you may have a case.  If not, you probably don't.  Did you get a residential service contract when you bought the house?  (AKA home warranty)    How big of a house that a new HVAC would cost $8,000?  Are you sure the company that gave you the bid is reputable?  You might want to get another estimate.

Tl82rbtZaa	As a former personal/business banker of Wamu I can assure you they do. Now, with the switch over with Chase I'd encourage you to give them a call or walk in a branch. However, according to my sources they have a couple different types of Overdraft. 1. Overdraft Limit= depending on activity and balances in your account, the computer system will automatically set you a limit once your account is estabolished. Every time you use this option it will pay your outstanding item but will charge you 35.00 every time. I do NOT consider this to be a wise choice. 2. Overdraft Transfer= You need a savings account w/ money in it for this option. On any given day that you might overdraft this option will cost you $10 to transfer an unlimited number of times from the savings account (as long as balance is sufficient). This is the most inexpensive way considering normal overdraft fees are generally 35.00 a pop! If you have a more complex account such as a Platinum checking or free business account...there are other options available but those that I listed are the most common.....PS. The business line of credit or (BLOC) as wamulians call it...is for small business owners only. Hope this info helped :)

The companies must meet Wal-Mart's stringent requirements and often offer price guarantees on purchasing, and delivery upon request. Check Walmartwatch.com|`|tAQvUE4kaa	Ir depends on the price of the item. You can buy a polo shirt from a factory for 26.00 or 52,00 per dz  The price would depend on the materials and machinery used, there are  different kinds of weave of  cotton. The type of dye used, the buttons used and even the amount of stitches can effect the price. You can go to the same factory to produce either standard. However there are factories that are set up to only make a higher standard product. The labor in different countries and factories also have an effect on price.  It is more likely that a lot of production for Wal-Mart is made in China than Japan. Wal-Mart also places orders in Malawi factories that are Chinese owned. Pakistan use to be a big supplier as well. Most factories overseas will claim that they produce for Wal-Mart, even if the production was rejected because of tight quality control standards.     Try searching a UPC   of one of the Wal-Mart or other retailers products that you are wondering about and you should be able to find the wholesaler or overseas factory that way.    You can bet that Nordstom and Dollar General do not use the same factories.    loveyalaterseeyabye/bdi

WYjbuu6saa	OK......here goes.....    Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in!!!  Many reasons.  Main reason?.......We simply have WAY TOO MANY Legal Professionals - we have a GLUT!  "Legal Professionals" includes, but is not limited to:  Attorneys/Lawyers, Paralegals, Legal Assistants, Legal Secretaries, Court Reporters, Bailiffs, etc, etc)    The economy is SATURATED with Legal Professionals.

The law schools know this, but they continue to churn out graduates - law students are easy money for them.    Now.....you would have a HUGE headstart if you go into the military.  But forget law.

So by claiming 1 on your W-4 less tax would be withheld throughout the year (about $300 per month) and you will get a refund about $3500 less than if you claimed 0.  Of course this assumes you have a job that pays well enough to have $3500 withheld in the first place.|`|Kl4kv5khaa	The more you claim the less taxes you pay during the year.

Pray that this man calms down and stops being such a miserable old jerk. I will pray for you and your family. No one deserves to be treated that way. I know it must be tough for you because no one should go through that ESPECIALLY while you are at work. You are there to make a living and provide...not get annoyed and hassled by some bozo.

Just know they can fire you on the spot for no other reason than - he's a manager and you're not - and you're apparently a "drama queen". Oh you aren't? Well, that's what they are going to say you are - especially in your line of work. I'd say get over it or get out.
4OKE5zAlaa	It depends on the restaurant, location, and shift.    I work at a Coney Island (a good one). It's casual, popular place location in the downtown area of a middle class city, so the location is good. The place is open 24 hours.    A dinner shift is from 4-9 or 5-9 pm, and you usually make around $50. This is known as the high school shift, because it's the lowest paying & shortest shift, so the girls tend to be younger.    The morning shift lasts from 9am-3pm or 11am-4pm, with one person working from 7am-3pm. The person who starts at 7 will make better money. The rest of the people will make around $75 on a week day, and $100+ on a Saturday or Sunday morning.    The night shift is usually the best, especially on weekends. The shift lasts from 9pm until 4 or 5am, depening on how busy it is. Usually 4am. If it's really busy, one person is asked to stay until the morning shift opener gets there, so 7am. A weekend night shift gets a crazy busy bar rush around 2am, so night shift is usually around $130 on a weekend.    Keep in mind that the differences are seasonal, too, especially in places where winter gets really cold weather. I live in Michigan, and business is a lot better in the summer.|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	That completely depends on the restaurant and the service given.|`|27jdKozNaa	Well it depends.    When I worked at Applebees I could work from 12 noon to 1am the next morning & maybe walk out with $150.00 bucks after tipping out to the host, busboy, bartender etc..  It really depends on the clientele, after 10pm its 1/2 price appetizers & two-fer drinks so it's alot of kids with no money sharing $3.00 boneless wings & water with a ton of lemons (grrrrrrrr!) so yeah 13 hours to make $150 bucks take home &basically be a babysitter to underaged morons-ummm yeah.    Now I work at a fine dining resturant, with table side service, so in 5 hours I can make $200.00.     it really just depends on the establishment that you work at & the type of people it attracts

Kwywmcs8aa	It works for most debts the main exclusion being student loans.  Chapter 13 is on your credit report for up to 7 years and you have to pay back a fraction of what you owe.  Chapter 7 pays nearly everything off and you only pay a couple thousand, but it stays on your credit report up to 10 years.  You can still have good credit with bankruptcy on your report it just appears as a side note.  You can reestablish your credit within a couple of  years, but interest rates on any loans or credit cards might be a little higher, but since you probably have bad credit already it won't be much of a difference. Talk to a bankruptcy lawyer to see what you should do.

UA8USXFNaa	There are hundreds of them! There's the magic circle, they're the biggest UK based international firms. Then there are the US firms which have offices in London. Both of these pay a lot and have extremely long hours. Then there are the mid-size London firms and the silver circle, which may have similar hours and pay, or may have slightly lower on both counts - it depends firm to firm. Then there are the smaller niche firms which often specialise in specific areas like media, sports, private client etc. These have fewer hours and lower pay usually. Really you need to research this yourself, there's no way anyone can say which is the 'best' firm because each has different strengths and weaknesses. Google 'chambers student guide', 'roll on friday', 'lex 100' and 'the vault'. Each of these lists most of the main London firms and has info on salary, practice strengths, hours, culture, what they look for in employees etc as well as the opinions of people who work there. The lex 100 is particularly interesting as it is a survey of current trainees on things like hours, client contact, friendliness of the firm etc. You can also look on 'the lawyer' and 'legal week' and do a search on any of the firms you find interesting to find news stories and opinions on those firms. The best way to find out about the culture of a firm is to try and get a place on a vacation scheme, most of them offer these for students in their second year and beyond.

Nursing homes often provide that training. In every area of medicine there are teams that assist in the main objective. Caring for people who are ill or want ot stay free of disease through education provided by those who have studied medicine, nursing and all the allied sciences. If you have a genuine interest in assisting the elderly in skilled nursing facilities it would be wise to get the training offered by the facility or a community college. As well, certified nurses aids can be trained by the skilled nursing facilities that hire them to be certain that they are trained properly and are often able to be certified after completing the course. Certification is done by the state. You could work for the dietary department or house keeping areas in these facilities. It is very difficult and will become more so to work in direct care of the elderly without a certification.

znr8SBiWaa	The IRS releases funds for direct deposits on Fridays, and ONLY on Fridays.    However, some banks will happily hold onto that money until Tuesday, so they don't have to pay you interest, and they can still use it for whatever.    So the IRS gives an estimated date of the Tuesday after direct deposit so they don't get blamed for the banks being greedy.    Also, many, many, many people's tax refunds got pushed back a week or more for various reasons.  For some people it was because they claimed an incorrect amount on line 70 of the return, which was for the Recovery Rebate Credit.  For others, it was just the IRS messing things up for whatever unknown reason that they will not say.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	I am not sure because I was originally set for the 30th then got pushed back to the tenth. the IRS rep told me to look for it this Friday.|`|SEwqwjPkaa	Several of my coworkers have received their refunds via DD from the IRS today. Those at least who's banks posted the funds this AM. I also received my refund on a Tuesday last year. And even this year, I'm scheduled to receive it on a Tuesday. Additionally, several posters around this category have posted that they've received their refunds this morning. As far as "when during the day" you should expect it, this all depends on when your bank receives and posts the funds. You may want to contact your bank to see how they handle it. Or, simply login to your bank account and check to see what electronic transactions have completed in the past and at what time (if this information is avail. to you).    Good Luck!    Peace!

JxpT4PlZaa	I just get "Server Unavailable" or blank screen also.
bu2BPue7aa	I too am frustrated and angry with the IRS.  I was originally givin a date of 1/30/09, then 2/3/09, now the IRS "where's my Refund" says 2/10/09.  SO I called the IRS to get an answer and was told my refund was in the error resolution department, but has been corrected, but she couldn't even tell me what the error was.  She said it could have been an error on their part but she doesn't know.  And then she proceeded to tell me my refund is not showing a deposit date yet, and it could take up to 4 weeks from 1/30/09 to get it.  My taxes were accepted on 1/20/09, but they didn't catch this so called mistake til 1/30/09, this is BS!  The women from the IRS also told me the "where's my refund" site hasn't been working right, and it is giving inacurate deposit dates.  So basically they just give us any BS date and have us sit around and wait, and hope we don't call and complain when the refund doesn't come.  And by the way I can't just chill out, I told my landlord I would give him the rent money on the 10th cause thats when the IRS told me I would have my refund, and now I won't have it, so unless you are going to give me $800 for my rent by 2/10/09, don't say just chill out!  My husband was laid off in November, we are barely making it, that refund was supposed to pay our Feb. rent and bills, but now I may not have it til March.  It does help to rant on here and it also helps to hear that others are having the same problem.         Thanks Luvthis, good luck to you too!  I will repost when and if I ever get my refund, or if I get any real responses from the IRS.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	NOT a soul......

"Chill out" is the ONLY valid advice here.  There's not a thing that you can do to speed up the process so stressing over it isn't going to do anything but raise your blood pressure.    If you don't like waiting on the IRS then cut your withholdings so that you break even or have a small debt to pay next year.  That way you are in the driver's seat, have your money ALL year, and don't need to go through the annual anguish of waiting on the return of your interest-free loan to the government back to your pocket.|`|Jwy4swuKaa	I was supposed to get mine by today ! :( I am very upset also!!!

Many people in these a hard times need that money just to get heating fuel, pay bills, food, etc, as for blood pressure, sometimes it helps just to be able to vent to someone else in the same boat.

7a702ee2eae799c88751b321d1011cd5aa	Hang in there.  You're still very young and you have time to make opportunities for yourself. Do not despair.    Take this job you've been offered. It's a paltry hourly pay, but its better than nothing. Don't just work it for the paycheck.  Learn while you are there.  Develop an enviable work ethic.  Learn the "business" side of retail.     While you're working at this job, look for another.  It's always better to look for new work while you're currently employed.  Demand higher pay at the next job, using your previous experience as a baseline for pay.      When you do find another job, do not quit your current one on bad terms.  Don't burn bridges.  You'll want to have a good reference from the current employer.    Another option to consider.  You say this job is part-time. Have you considered a 2nd part-time job?  Maybe something with less hours than the current part-time job to supplement your income.    In the meantime, try to figure out what you REALLY want to do as far as a career or job.  Consider what your strengths and gifts are. Make a list of them.  Then research careers and jobs which compliment those gifts and talents.    Education is a factor. If you don't have the time, means or inclination to go to college, consider certification courses.  Online courses.  Trade and vocational schools.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I would personally still take the job, it's better than nothing.  Since it's part time you will still have plenty of time to look for another job while working at this one.  Make sure you don't get comfortable in the job, keep up the fighting spirit and devote a lot of time looking for work elsewhere.      What is the minimum wage in the states?  Pretty sure it's well over $8/hr in Canada..|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Why are you so obsessed with your age of 24?

Look into job training programs in you area. Go back to school, even part time. Look for ways to make extra income (like babysitting). Get involved in your community. Network. Take care of yourself.    Improving your circumstances is not going to happen overnight. The current economy is making it even harder. Times will change. Look to growth fields like health care. Prepare yourself for better times.    Keep hope alive. It isn't easy out there. It is frustrating. Look to the future. Baby steps are better than taking no action at all. You can do it!|`|hnRHjTmzaa	Just remember, you have to start somewhere.    Those wages may seem like peanuts to you -- but remember, it's SOMETHING. Save up as much as you can. Get different spending habits. Save save save.    Stick with this job for awhile, and keep looking for higher paying jobs. Just make sure you keep the job though -- wages might seem low to you but once again - it's something, and you were lucky enough to get the job in the first place. A lot of people right now, cannot say the same. Jobs are few and far in between,.    Good luck to you!!! It will add up soon! Just wait ;-)|`|BZF9evz1aa	$6.55 an hour beats $0.00 an hour. can you make it yes. will it be easy no. spend every minute you have off dropping off applications and resumes off at other companies. look for companies that you may have room to grow with. larger companies will pay better and offer benefits. dress for success. be confident.

CNvbCpgLaa	Believe it or not, I actually developed a cashier's test. It was years ago, back in the early 90s. It was a civil service exam for the city of New York. As I recall, there were a lot of questions of the following nature:     How much money is there if you have so many quarters, so many dimes, etc., etc., etc. That's a lot of what a cashier does.    I also included a reading comprehension part. You had to read a passage about how to detect counterfeit bills, then answer a few multiple choice questions about it. I thought that was a clever idea because it was so relevant to the job.    So anyway, lots of math and a little reading comprehension. Hope that helps.    Now then, I'm a little confused about why you're asking. Are you looking to find a test to take, or are you already scheduled to take a test? If the latter, the people offering the exam should give you some sample test items.
dRezbY31aa	The insurance companies don't care if you're making payments. If you just want liability there's not a single one that won't sell it to you, just don't tell them there is a lien holder. It's the bank that requires "full coverage" to protect their interest. If they find out you don't have comp and collision coverage they will place it on for you and you'll have to pay for it. Most likely the bank placed coverage will cost more.     The police don't care if you don't have comp and collision - they just care that you have liability and if you're caught without it you will get a ticket and they'll remove your tags.|`|AA10792562	The fact that you are still paying off your bike is irrelevant.  If you negligently injure someone, you are legally liable.  So you need liability insurance.  If you are stopped by the police you will need to show evidence of insurance.    Try GEICO.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Sure they would, but it's not going to do you any good.      See, your deal with the insurance company is one deal.   Your deal with the bank, is a different deal.  The bank says, if you DON'T put full coverage on the bike, we're going to charge you an extra $600 a month on your loan.  If you don't PAY that extra $600 a month, we're going to repo the bike.     So yes, anyone will give you liabilty only.  Like Progressive.  But it won't make the bank happy, and it won't keep them from a repo on the bike.      My suggestion - try to sell the bike.

f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	Legal, yes but probably won't work like you expect.    First if you take cash out that is considered a Cash Advance and those are usually not covered under the 0% offers.  In fact you will probably be paying at least 20% interest from day one, and probably closer to 24%.  Second most credit cards have a Cash Advance Limit that is less than your total limit.  So you may not even be able to take out $300.    You need to read the terms and find out exactly.    A better thing to "build" your credit is to use that card for items you would normally pay cash on.  Then at the end of the month pay it off.  Yes it is 0% interest, but if you get into that habit now it will help you down the road.  The catch here is to not use more than 30% of your limit.|`|z88IMXNFaa	The 0% does not apply to cash advances.  It never does.  A cash advance will cost you a transaction fee (usually 3% of the advance) plus interest from the moment you take the cash.    Read your credit agreement!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	As far as establishing credit it is never a good  idea  to max out the first card you get or  any  cards you take out in the future.. That wold negatively affect your credit score. It is also not good to open several accounts within a short period, I suggest you get the first card and charge an amount you can easily pay in full. It;s really not  wise to get a get one credit card to pay if  another. It takes time to establish good credit so don't rush it.|`|I9Jt1MxIaa	It is completely legal, and a great way to build credit.|`|AA10124990	This is not illegal but won't help with your credit score. Opening more than 1 credit card account within a 6-month period actually hurts your credit score.|`|sPKbvdCfaa	It's legal. You can definitely do this although you may want to re-think your strategy. Credit card companies prey on people like you everyday. They are hedging their bet that you will screw up your account, either go over the limit, miss or be late on a payment. At which time they jack your interest rate to 30%. They are multi million dollar companies, they make their money off people just like you. Stay away from them. Save your money and pay cash for everything. You don't need credit. Credit score is a what a status symbol or something??

Go to RCI.com  Click on the Resort Directory tab  Scroll down to the bottom  Under Search for RCI Affiliated Resorts, type in Royal Goan and click Search  On next screen, (may need to scroll up) click on Show Results    Most of them have excellent ratings.  If you click on the Map View tab it shows that one some of the resorts are not all together in the same spot, but close proximity to each other.    RCI is a great timeshare exchange company.  You'll enjoy doing exchanges with them.  Keep in mind that you are looking at a like for like exchange for what you trade with RCI.  This will help you immensely and give you fantastic vacations.    You can also get more information from tripadvisor.com and search Royal Goan and you will get the same 4 resorts pop up.  My advice though, don't let one or two poor reviews deter you from the resort.  Sometimes people have a minor experience and they make it affect their entire vacation.    I do use these websites frequently to get the best vacation experience.    Good luck and Happy Vacationing! :)|`|L67GTLROaa	Try looking on website like   http://www.rci.com  http://www.tripadvisor.com

You point out the positive features and show the vacant units. No license is needed if you only manage one complex.

Aside from teaching them, try some good techniques to how they can stay in control, especially while you're their teacher.

JZG7vpUlaa	Generally speaking, it is because the agents are dispassionate.  The seller's agent might tout the landscaping but he didn't do it.  The buyer's agent might agree that the whole colour scheme sucks but she's not going to have to repaint.  For the most part the agents are there to talk dollars and secondarily closing times and inclusions, etc.    Buyers and sellers are not good at negotiations.  They get offended, they think someone should feel sorry for them, they think their taste is the best, they both think they deserve a deal, yada yada.    Most of the job of real estate agents is showing reality to both buyers and sellers.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	If it was that easy to negotiate a sell of the home a seller would just sell it themselves without a realtor.  First think about offering the seller your first offer right in front of them. If this Still makes no since then go to wal mart and off $50.00 on that $500.00 TV set.  This is like a slap in the face. Some people can get very upset on a ridicules offer.  And then where will that leave you? and the seller?  Remember these people have spent a great deal of there lives in this home. So there is some kind of sentimental parts still left in the home.
Au2aI9a2aa	Have you checked with the building codes and the landlord before a build out. The city council will need to verify any and all construction that will be done.

If every consumer were like you, we wouldn't be in this mess subprime mortgages got us into.    I tell my clients that it is usually worth it to refinance if they are getting a full percentage point lower, and planning to stay in the house for about 3 years to recoup the closing costs you're about to sink into the property.    If I were you I'd wait until rates hit 4.875%.

However, the interest you paid during 2008 on your school oan may be deductible.    See: http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch0...

If you are married and these totals are for you and your spouse combined, you'll get a bigger refund. If you have kids it will get even bigger. If someone else can claim you as their dependent, then you'll get a smaller refund.

It all depends on where you live and how bad the housing bubble was for your area but if you are going off of zillow.com for you value it is probably wrong.

Chances are your deprecation on your property will be made up over the long term of your loan if the interest rate is right.

If you have the income to support the payments they will work with you.    They key is make them think that if they do not help you you are going to not be able to make anymore payments.    They do not want another foreclosure on their hands and if you play your cards right you can usually get really good rates.  I did my own a little while ago without missing a payment and got one year at 1% the next year at 3% then a year at 5% the next at 5.5% and then locked in for the remainder of my mortgage at 6.25%.    Give it a try.  I am currently $60,000 upside down.      That is also good information to pass on to them.  If they are greedy make them think that you will stop paying and they will get a house back after spending $40,000 to foreclosure that is worth even less.    There are also lots of companies out there that will help you with that process.  Watch out!!! They can only collect upfront fees if they are licensed mortgage brokers.  The exact rules vary from state to state but know that there is now a huge business in taking advantage of distressed homeowners.

pCEA7Pu8aa	It is different from state to state.  I believe California is non-judiciary so it does not take much to foreclose.     As far as a penalty because you refinance I have never heard of anything like that.  Refinancing is the main reason most people are in foreclosure.    Your best bet is to find someone that specializes in negotiating with your bank and delaying the process.    This way you can stay in your home longer and you will have someone on your side trying to defend your interest.    If they bank forecloses on your house you will be responsible for the difference between what you owe and how much they sell it for plus closing cost plus lawyer fees plus, plus, plus.  This is called a deficiency judgement.    Although you might not get anything from the bank for a year or two eventually they will know exactly how much money they lost, down to the penny, and then they will want it back.    If you are able to do a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure you are able to negotiate all of that in the process and get them to waive the deficiency judgement.  They will then issue a 1099 because although the money was lost it was still money they gave you and you will have to report that to the IRS.  There is a new law however that states if it was your primary residence then the 1099 will not apply.    You can also negotiate that they bank waive the 1099.    All in all the best thing to do is find someone that specializes in the whole process.  Almost always it is impossible for you, the client to negotiate the short sale.  The bank may let you negotiate a deed in lieu but be careful because they are still going to try and get a deficiency judgement from you.    Good Luck.|`|NkqPHojFaa	A record number of homes were lost to foreclosure in California over the last three months, up 228% from last year to a high of 79,511 homes. MDA DataQuick reported that more homes were taken back by lenders in the three months ended Sept. 30 than at any time since the company started tracking foreclosures in 1992.    Housing experts say that change is the direct result of a new state law that forces lenders to make repeated attempts to contact a homeowner before foreclosing on the home.    The website below may provide some insight for you.  http://www.refinancing101.net    Good Luck......!

The modeling business is so fiercely competitive that those who have the desire to work "must" be pursuing the opportunities on a full time bases.   Once a model establishes themselves with the various agencies and their clientele they are called on a perennial bases for the various trade shows, fashion shows and Television Commercials.     Endeavoring to promote yourself as a fashion model while holding down studies at the University level may well cause you more of a distraction than it is worth, and may actually costing you far more than you could ever imagine.    You could find out if the local art schools are in need of models for their photographers or painters.  Being that your paying for University courses you certainly know that they can afford to pay, however; some models may perform these services for barter and trade directly with the students, in trade for photographs or paintings.  This may even be an opportunity, freshen up the Portfolio and have some new photographs or a unique painting to show the various modeling agencies.    Good Luck!    I think one of the oldest professions in the world would be the most efficient way to address financial needs of an attractive young women, and that of course would be as a bartender or in the private clubs working as a croupier.     Here is the name of one agency in Scotland. There does not seem to be many  in the country, maybe you should consider starting one. No really, then you could negotiate the contract and send yourself out as the model for the cliente.  Nice work if you can get it, and you can get if you try!  You'd need to invest in alot of wigs, make up and possible take some acting lessons as a University elective.

Good Luck, hope it's better than mine, and enjoy what time you do get to have off, especially if going to school to get an even better job than before!|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	Unemployment benefits vary from to state, but they do not pay for college. You might qualify for some kind of grant(s) for educational expenses, but it's best to talk to a financial counselor at whatever school you are interested in about that.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	I can unreservedly say that IT will continue its position as a high demand dominant career.    Just ask yourself this simple question.  Is our sociecty getting more or less technical? Is there/are there... More or less gadgets?  More or less Internest connectivity? More or less tech in cars? More or less need for tech solutions to big eco, economic, social problems?    IT isn't going anywhere for a long long time.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	sure they still have a lot of nations they can exploit
YQ1Q7XeEaa	Understand this - there is no such thing a a recession proof job.    IT is more resilient than most because you can use your transferable skills in many places working on many types of applications.    That being said - we've laid off IT workers (mainly help desk & support).  But I would rather be one of them in a layoff than an HR manager because there are a lot more IT jobs out there than general office jobs.|`|bVROvLNSaa	Nothing is recession or layoff proof these days, darling, nothing at all.

As far as career advice, choose something you enjoy, not what makes the most money. Money can be budgeted to fit your lifestyle but you'll be at this job for the majority of your waking hours a day so you want to choose something you'll enjoy.|`|qYZkeB8maa	I would say play it safe.  Some might not agree, but in being unemployed and unable to pay your bills is no joke.  I have friends who majored in things like psychology, sociology, and journalism and they are struggling to find jobs because they are just out of college with little experience and having to compete with all the unemployed people with tons of experience.  Not trying to scare you, but there is nothing wrong with a back up plan.  Anyone who says otherwise, can a visit their local unemployment office and see that some jobs are being laid off more so than others and soon find out that unemployment is one of the biggest life stressors a person can experience.  Can you do a double major?

pCEA7Pu8aa	I think the best course is to start talking with your current lender.  They are starting to give out more and more loan modifications.      Although they are generally doing to for clients that are behind in payments I think that they will be more than happy to start working with you.  If the value is there, they are willing to work with you because they are scared to lose you.      They will not work with you however if you can not show them that you can afford it or if the value is not there.  It appears that your value is there but we are seeing that todays prices are the equivalent of 2002 prices depending on where you were and how high the bubble was.    You might be able to show the bank that because of the renter you can afford it and maybe they will work with you.  There are companies out there that will help you negotiate but watch out.  They will want an up front fee.  In many states they can only collect an up front fee if they are a licensed mortgage broker.

Schwab and E*trade are highly rated as well and all within a few dollars of each other in terms of commission. The difference between these two and TD is they want you to keep your money in a checking account if it's not invested. TD uses a money market account (MMA). They have similar minimums (around $2K) to start an account.     Scottrade is much more barebones, a lot less research, you can't sell short and they don't have as many options to protect you, such as the stop loss.     You can go even further into barebones with sites such as TradeKing.     I would suggest you start with one of the popular online discount brokers (TD, Schwab, E*Trade) simply because you will get better support. I know TD has a lot of research that is very simple to understand (buy, hold, sell) but still has the complex research behind it if you do come to understand or desire that. Plus you can call them 24/7 and ask them anything about stocks. Don't know what a stop loss is?

When you get your State refund, go ahead and file the amended return with your state.  Same rule on the refund from your State applies; you will probably owe something so don't spend it all until you have prepared the amended return.    The IRS won't have your W-2 data until June or July at the earliest.  They will NOT correct the error at this early date!

W9zRaPp9aa	First of all, be careful importing any knockoff brands. If they are discovered by customs they will be confiscated and you will be charged a hefty fine.     Your own private Label should not be a problem if the volume of clothes is such that you could justify an initial purchase of about 500 - 1000 sew in tags. having them produced overseas would also result in great savings. There are many markets world wide where fashion Designs can be bought in small quantities at wholesale prices.     The difficulty for you is that you cannot see everything that is available without traveling yourself. some one could send you pictures of available designs, based on what you would say you want, but I think it also important that you see the product so you can see the quality for yourself.    All this being said, what you want is not impossible. I live in Thailand and import many products to america. I do very little with fashions at this time however.    If you could provide me with some more specific information of what styles you wanted I could possibly put you in touch with some wholesalers here, and coordinate for you.    If you could afford the trip (it would be fully tax deductible for your business) You could do considerably better.|`|PRihWRTIaa	Hi  It is very hard to manufacture such a small quantity unless it is available in stock.

Most cases since Texas has no state tax - Texas may be inapplicable.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You file adding both incomes together, if you use free file any vendor that applies, it will have you add the appropriate state data.

To do it on a program like that will keep it all figured out correctly. I would suggest reading through each state return form and instructions for each state and see if there are special state rules on anyting that applies to you. Your not the only one, so they free file sites starting thru irs.gov are set up. Each company has its own criteria by income amt age and state to make sure the site you choose shows both states, you cal also select fed only the site will still take in all the info, watch what its filling in, then at the end, do the free file fed only and then go print out state taxes and file seperately and mail them.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	If you already moved out and moved back in you can be arrested for breaking and entering and trespassing.   That would be the criminal end.    On the civil end your landlord will prevail.   The landlord has no liability for lost wages, that is between the employee and employer.    She does not owe for any damages either, that is what your insurance is for, she is not liable just because your father did not want insurance.    The hotel she will have to pay part of.   She has to pay the same as rent, whatever 1/30th of the monthly rent is, she has to pay that per day.   But, it sounds like she may have done this, as you state she did refund rent.    In addition to the above the landlord will likely receive damages for the apparent break in, any lost rent because you are preventing her from repairing/renting her property by illegally residing in it.    I do not have any clue how you thought this was sensible.  Just because the property is vacant does not mean that anyone can just break in and decide they are going to live there.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	your story is a bit convoluted.    however, the LL cannot throw you out without a formal  eviction notice and court judgments in her favor.|`|HUAYinN7aa	Why were you evacuated from the house?

Now as far as her telling you to get out be sure you have an tenant/landlord attorney look at it. e-mails are now admissible in court. Her telling you not to come back to the home is a breach of the lease. Unless the home is uninhabitable. If that is the case then her only option would be to give you your security deposit back and you then can rent someplace else. But there is a lot of things that are missing in you question to really help.  Hope all goes well.|`|LenfoJSRaa	The only way to really know is to get a consultation with an attorney who specializes in property or tenant/ landlord law. They will let you know if it was illegal and what can be done about it.  Also you can look up the laws in your states and see if any of them were violated. If you know for sure they were AND you can prove it (this is pretty important, you must get as much proof as you can) then pursue a lawsuit. Many times what makes cases unable to be won is that the proof is not there and the burden of proof is on both sides. It's really sad because many times people are telling the truth but if there is no proof they are wasting their time and chances of winning decrease dramatically.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	Pretty sure the lease is void when there is no longer an apartment.

I was fined for "weeds" in my lawn.   I had no weeds.    I had paid a small fortune for these little bulbs to bloom in early spring, when the grass was not growing, and die off a month later.    I love them, I even plant them at some of my rentals.    But, anyway, they had the power to call my flowers weeds and I had to pay a stupid fine every spring for them.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	any assn in the US may choose to have fees or no fees and they  can change that rule as often as they like.

That doesn't mean, however, that they're going to fix the door this week.

For a college kid - do you think maybe you might be being a little too picky about what kind of work you do? My first year in college I worked at a fast food place... it's not glamorous but it was money. Lower your career priorities a bit for now and do something local. Don't worry about it - you'll have a decent job later - that's why you're in college right? I would do that - and choose NOT to delay my schooling.

q0oZ8eOzaa	Many IT employers will use a 4 year degree as a basic qualifier. If you have a degree they will consider your application and if you don't they just pitch it in the trash. A degree tells and employer two things - that you are teachable and that you will finish what you start. They will plan to retrain you to their way of doing things and want to know you are teachable. Not completing a degree leads them to believe you can't be trained and may not complete what you start. It may not be fair but that is reality.    The exception is someone who is self taught where they find a situation in a small company and do ok there for a while. The problem comes when they try to leave there and move up to any large company and discover there is a big glass ceiling for anyone without a degree.|`|abc09a8025c84e0efb54f40a15d2f2e6aa	you can learn the very basics, but to get a job, you really need that degree.

421dcce2d04218899e188207a7cfb2adaa	I am an American living in Sweden. I have been here for two years and am going to Komvux. I have been married to a Swede for 10 years so residency is not a problem.  I have a Bachelor degree in preschool education and I have to say that it is difficult to get a job.  Even Swedes have a difficult time finding employment.  There is a high unemployment rate here. However, at komvux there are a few people who work so nothing is impossible. But definitely make sure I had the resources to support yourself here. There is no assistance if you don't have residency.  One idea for you is to apply for US financial aid and apply to schools here in Sweden because they offer many classes which are taught in English.  You can go to school during the day and komvux two evening per week or you can take Swedish in a University. The one GREAT thing about Sweden is that the government subsidizes all tuition for all students both foreign or domestic.  So, in other words, tuition is FREE for everyone.

Jobs are hard to find in some places, especially if you don't speak Swedish. I live in Northern Sweden, they opened a new store here and were hiring 50 people, and 30 of those were part-time. They had 1,000 people show up for the interviews.
AA12393872	You have to do a lot of research. Buy some products that you like. Read what it says on the box that it was shipped from and contact them directly. They will tell you how you can buy from them or a distributor that they deal with exclusively that you can contact. Some companies sell wholesale in small amounts, some just can't be bothered with those size of orders. Also, keep your ears and eyes open for small time perfume and cologne manufacturers, Mom and Pop shops. This could be a nice niche for you and set you apart from the everybody else that just sells generically, selling only the same mass marketed stuff as everybody else. Next are trade magazines on colognes and perfume as both are out there too. They could lead you into unique areas and markets as well. Remember to use Google too! It may take time but research and following through will open doors up for you.  PS-- another side item that you will find in a lot of the same markets as colognes and perfumes is scented soaps. Just a little extra thought for you. Good Luck on your searching and many sales to come!|`|AA12376076	I have some info I can send you if you'd like.

4511c6cd18d55193e749f13006368b25aa	You're only 21 and you already know you're going to retire from your county job? Sounds very immature. You're in a very high credit risk category, with a huge risk of default. Why would anyone lend you money at 15%? I'm not sure why anyone will would lend you at ANY rate at all.    I'm guessing some of your debts are now in collection. See if you can negotiate with the collectors to pay off a smaller amount. Sometimes they'd rather accept a smaller amount than nothing at all. You may need help of credit counseling services, just make sure they're legit. Read my source for some more information about this.    It looks like minimum monthly payments for your debts add up to at most $650/mo (my estimate). If you don't want to or can't declare bankruptcy (which I don't recommend), what you need to do is order all your debt by APR, and while making minimum payments on all of them, put any extra money you have towards the debt with the highest interest rates. Do not be tempted to pay off the smallest debts, it is financially unwise. You will pay off all your debts much faster if you pay down highest interest debts first.    It's hard to believe you can find a 1-br for $250/mo anywhere. But you didn't include any other bills (electricity, gas, land-line, cable). I certainly hope you don't have cable or land-line.    You have an $82/mo cell phone bill. What's wrong with you? Do you realize that's almost $1000/year? You could be using most of that to pay down your debt. Nobody needs that much cell phone. Start watching your minutes. Start using the landline instead of the cell phone and get rid of the cell completely. If you need it for emergencies, get a pre-paid one (only pay for the minutes you use). If you have a computer, get Skype (free PC-to-phone calls until January).    You should not have co-signed your cousin. If they fail to pay, or are late, you'll get a ding in your report (and it'll stay there for a long time).    While it appears your heart is in the right place (the only reason I'm replying to this question at all), you still have a long way to go before you can be trusted with money. Come up with a budget, follow through with my suggestions, read the resources below, and tighten your belt. You should be out of this mess in a few years.    And "Of Course I would quit. I would actully just leave and not tell anyone because everyone annoys me here" yet again shows your immaturity. You're only working because you need the money (not because you like it), and you don't like anyone where you are yet you plan to retire from where you work.|`|4eeef58afca8d5763692f5c95e820b8aaa	eloan.com

KQF5X9Vpaa	it really depends on the company, if the company paid you a paycheck in TN and KY then u might get 2 W-2s with each states different income, then again they may put it all on one since it's the same company...the best answer you can get is from the company themselves...they will know for sure|`|hc9PgibAaa	That depends on your company...if their HR and payroll departments are in the same location no matter where you worked you might only get one W-2 with each states info on it.

On each state return, you will report income earned while in that state.    If you are present in a state, then any income earned during this period, must be reported to the state. //np To your resident state, you must report your worldwide income for the year.

AA10469473	It wasn't tax fraud, but it was illegal.  Since it's been filed though you'll have to do an amendment to claim the deductions he missed.  I'd go back and talk to a supervisor - they should file the amendment at no charge, and probably give you a break on your fees.    Not cause for a lawsuit that you'd win.

q0oZ8eOzaa	I think that I personally would favor Network Security because that is my area of interest but you really need to pick what your area of interest is. If you like to program and write code or design hardware systems then the Computer Engineering is probably up your alley. If you like to administer and secure systems and do systems administration then Network Security might be a better choice.    Remember that in many of these areas it is not difficult to go sideways into another field if you decide to change majors or decide to change careers while out in the workforce. The decision you are making right now does not lock you in forever. Relax - it will be OK.       Best wishes!!!

KQF5X9Vpaa	it depends on your deductions and whether you got the stimulus check last year among other things...the only way to tell for sure is to file you tax return|`|AA10469473	Without knowing your income and what was withheld for federal income tax, among other things, no way to tell.  If nothing was withheld though for FIT, you won't get a refund unless you qualify for a refundable credit like EIC.
AA12020487	I feel ya ... same crap happened to me and i didnt even get all of the money they claimed i got. F u c k the IRS.|`|hc9PgibAaa	No...it wasn't a loan and you weren't paying it back.  Most tax software was set up to assume you would be able to claim the recovery rebate.  Basically adding the $1200 into your total before it knows for sure if you qualify.  When it finds that you already got your rebate it taxes the $1200 recovery rebate off your refund total.  It is just a short cut they used that has proven to confuse many tax payers!|`|5UAUrm9Waa	I believe you mean reporting rebate amount that you recived to your tax...that should be correct if its just reporting..IRS wants us to report what we received as rebate for 2007 tax returns in 2008. Did i answer your question right..?
AA11671958	No, you will not receive any additional funds from the IRS.  The purpose of the program the IRS has is to payout the stimulus payments that were not claimed or not disbursed last year.  If indeed you were owed additional funding (your not as you were not married last year) it would come with your income tax return.  Do get your hopes up, and next year you may want to file your taxes online for no cost instead of using these rip off places who charge too much, and don't know anything about doing real taxes.  The IRS has many "free file" sites linked, check them out.|`|ucF2xy6Aaa	i used hrblock.com -- all they do is ask you how much you got. if its less than 1200 for couples, then they add the remainder onto your refund amount.     you're probably paying some idiot way too much to prepare your taxes when if you can do simple data entry and answer yes or no questions, then you can do it yourself for way cheaper.|`|5UAUrm9Waa	I absolutely agree with Jim..!! The IRS wants to know what was actual amount received by you as rebate..therefore if I was filing I would put down the amount that each of you actually received...!! As you said in your words totalled $600; and not what was supposed to be received. I hope this answers your question.      If they insist may be their programs does work otherwise, but to my understanding most programs require you to enter the actual amount that was received and not what was expected to be received..!! And most programs has help screens to guide them, I would ask them to read the help screen of field where they key in that entry. That would layout how the program treats that entry..which is obvious no way to determine what actually received by you. If that place has multiple locations i would find out from some other location answer to that just to make sure.
5e0755e06d5f4f1b24b497cc9427c910aa	Doba is totally legit.  Most of their stuff is not priced to sell, so it's a lot of work researching what's going to sell.  There's no turnkey solution for eBay.|`|kArEdAaTaa	Personally, I wouldn't recommend it I linked up with them & sold their products for one month. I had 3,900 and some change in sales (but between GREED-BAY'S (EBAY) listing fees & Final Value Fee & Dobas commission, & don't forget pay-pal takes fees from every payment you receive. Anyways I sold 3,900 worth of merchandise supplied by Doba out of that 3,900 I made 602. It was just a waste of my precious time & money. You have to pay after your FREE TRIAL ends. Also another problem I had with DOBA, I was always getting very low detailed seller ratings bc DOBA ships when they want to & they weren't in any hurry. I did receive 2 negative feedback's as well because the package was damaged and one was never received. So with all that being said I would never never ever trust any drop shipper again. I started cleaning out the children's closet along with mine & husbands. Started over with new ID & everything. Now I have 82 -100% positive feedback ratings & satisfied customers. Also the simple thing to do is hit Yard sales or buy things in bulk from Craigslist, I go to thrift stores (especially goodwill-when they have their sales once a month).   NAME BRAND clothing sells very well & with 82 customers Ive already had Ive made 700 something on my own.     TO SUM IT ALL UP DOBA IS A WASTE OF TIME & EFFORT!|`|zK1xIGV7aa	Doba is a legitimate dropshipper unlike some scams out there, but the downside is that you have no control over the companies supplying your product to the ebay buyer.  If you have a product in mind to sell, you might be better off contacting a manufacturer or wholesaler directly and cut out middlemen such as Doba. I have tried dropshipping with Shopster and have had some modest success.  There is no perfect solution though.

ca0c9cd67b3aab31ab860e7488fa2ad0aa	When applying for a job try to provide very strong message of intention and commitment. Curriculum vitae is an idea. Make it short for the beginning; name, address, phone, other contact (like e-mail) and describe your abilities as they are. Hand write it if no other possibility is available.One photo would do better.   Regarding experience: is abnormal to ask for experience to an young man of 16. But not many people believe in you yet. So ask for simple recommendation from your parents or a close relative; teacher is also good enough.  Be prepared for refusal at first meeting. Be the first to propose a term for second attempt and ask politely for keep contact. Try to be sincere and tell is urgent for you. My suggest is to begin with part-time work despite disadvantage of salary. This way gives you smoother transition towards hard work, preserve some time for necessary recover and extra activities.   Regarding fast-food: this is really good environment to get familiar with people and life or to escape family problems; i think this is also a real positive human activity. But try join a quite young team (i mean collegues). In part of working time you'll have to do conversation with your camarades and it would be better to have mutual subjects: sports, nature, family, learning and then harder things...Of course food and don't be to ashame to keep your eating style. I worked for McDonald's, i tried almost all meals, i found them good but i always preffered chicken based products and this is it. Be yourself and keep in mind your health.  Other activities i believe are possible for you. it depends very much on your resources of living if only i can transmitt you this concept...i don't mean monney. it's something more. it's about optimism and self motivation. very important are relations with positive people and will to overcome difficulties. So consider "simple" jobs as gardening, painting, cleaning as normal extents to your growing.  Sure it's harder sometimes than you expect. Giving up with REASON is rational and can be accepted. Try to fight with panic and seekness not by hiding them. Reveal to close people as detailed as you can and to others just admitt them with no details.  i was 16 and frightened by future. now i'm 41, still going forward but fears remains. i did at least 5 different jobs and only 1 boss fired me.  i started at 19. You will do better. I'm sure. Your parents deep in their souls still love you my friend. And there will be oher people in your life with same feelings. Up to you if this matters.  One last thing: you are unique. no one could be you and no one can accomplish your dreams, they can just help...|`|AA11579568	Think of places/services that people HAVE to use:  Daycare/tutoring  Gas station  Grocery store|`|lVNYRSs8aa	it's not bad working at a fast food place, you still get some experience and it's good to know you worked your way up    but there should be some programs in your city that help you find jobs for youths, so look around, i was able to get an internship that way|`|1wDkKyLCaa	be happy your only sixteen needing a job, there are a zillion people not working.

eACZ1Rhjaa	They have different things on the table so it depends what is in the real package.   One thing is they may reduce the 15% bracket to 10% up to about 33K of AGI.

One proposal is a 15K or 10% up to 15% tax break on home buyers even if not first time. If you are in the market for a 150K home that can be very nice.

If that's the case, why not just give the boss a little more effort instead of wondering whether his or her motives are ethical.    Sometimes bosses aren't aware of the impact of their criticisms ... it's their intent that should be examined.  And if you believe in your heart that your boss's intent is to spur harder work, step it up and look good for doing it!|`|AA10686717	Yes.  Bosses are responsible for accomplishing certain objectives to make their company successful.  They do this through the team of people they manage. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link so a manager must constantly evaluate the members of the team to ensure they are accomplishing what they were hired to do.  If a person is not pulling their share of the weight or is failing or is doing things that hurt the team, the boss must take care of it or else it will drag the entire group down and maybe the whole company.  People should be compared both to an objective benchmark and to the rest of the team.  Jack Welch is a legendary business guru and he espouses "differentiation," where a company ranks its employees regularly and gets rid of the bottom 10% every time because those people are dragging the company down.  And don't say "an attempt to make them work harder" like it was a bad thing: some people should work harder and need a boss to get on their case and force better results out of them.

Post flyers where your customers frequent.    2) Advertise Locally -- Newspapers, Craigslist, Yahoo! Local    3) Word of Mouth -- Offer a great service & people will talk.    4) Mailers -- Send out coupons, specials, etc.    Hope that helps!

Do you rent or own your home?  Do you have significant student loans?  Do you have other debts?  Child support?  Spousal support?    As a general rule, your housing payment should be equal to or less than 28% of your total income.  Your housing payments plus minimum debt payments should be equal to or less than 35% of your total income.  These are general Sallie Mae/Freddie Mac guidelines that are used when qualifying someone for a mortgage.  Borrowers that fall within these guidelines are an acceptable credit risk, which in my mind translates to a long-term sustainable financial plan.    Example  ============================  28% of $60,000/year is about $1,400 a month.  If your rent and/or mortgage payment is less than that (check www.rent.net to verify rents in the Delaware area) then you should be good to go on that side.    35% of $60,000/year is about $1,750 a month.  If your debt payments are $350 or less per month, then you're OK there as well.    Congratulations on your new job offer!  Good luck to you!

Show the ads to your boss, and let them know that this is the going salary for someone in your position.

AA11334957	I would need to know more details than just the name of the company since the names change daily.   General rule is, if it sounds to good to be true it generally is.  Africa and especially Ghana and Nigeria right now are hot beds for fraud and scams. Ghana is the number one country for credit card fraud this year. I'm not generalizing and saying that all people there do this, I'm just saying that it's a rising crime in those countries. I used to advice people not to take part in anything that involved their own money, but you cannot count on that anymore either. Sometimes they will send you a money order and you think you are covered. Only after you send the moneys on to where ever they specified does your bank inform you that the money order was no good and you are left holding the bag. Friend of mine lost $2400 this way.  In a different scam they only use your address and offer you items or money to do so. What they do is they steal tourists or business peoples credit card info and then order merchandise online with it. They then have the items sent to your address in order to not be traceable should the whole thing blow up some day. The only thing they have you doing is forward the merchandise. Anyhow, sorry about ranting and raving, but I would be extremely careful.|`|52a3326d9ce1a778637b9a1655d37bedaa	...and you probably have to send them $300+ to apply for the job...run!|`|da5dcee11d5a2afcb2e5d74f0ff69119aa	Never heard if them is this another scam

I am from Michigan and I understand the laws vary state to state.   The next time they pay late go to small claims court and file an eviction notice. You fill out all the paper work and they will help you with it. Bring a copy  of the lease with you.   They will get served papers or you can serve them. You go to court and the judge hears both sides. You will be able to choose if you want them to pay up and stay or pay up and go. When all this is over, you can then put it on their credit report and also include the bad checks they wrote you. Here if you don't file a claim in small claims court you cannot do anything to their credit report.     I would carry out the small claims because the only way you can get them is if they use you for a reference and they cannot be that stupid. Also you will be able to go after anything they still owe you. You can do a garnishment from their paycheck............    The really sad thing is, you want to get rid of them. They go look at something to rent and USE you for a reference while they are still renting from you. WHAT do you do? If you tell the truth, you are stuck with them. If you lie and say they are good people, could you live with that?  A hint for you in the future, when you check landlord references, don't ask the current landlord, go back one more and you'll get the truth. The current ones will lie just to get rid of them. Also be alert when someone tells you they have lived at home or with a relative for the last five years.

054a5799d00717b4d46ef1be20f56485aa	I am assuming you are in a retail environment.      I would recommend you look at service as well as price.  When you are talking about market rates that are 2 or 3 basis points different (100 basis points = 1%), the difference in costs are minimal.  Watch out for low rates that you can't qualify for.  Acquiring banks take the 200 or so Visa/MasterCard Interchange rates and put them in the categories of Qualified, Mid-Qualified and Non-Qualified.  How they dump them into those categories is entirely up to them.  You could have only a few Qualified conditions and many more that don't qualify.  So, don't let the basic discount rate fool you.  Read the fine print.    Look for a company that can evaluate not only today but every six months how your processing needs maybe changing.  There are also special plans like small ticket merchants (under $25) that have different rate structures, which are actually better than standard retail rates.  Remember the accounting mantra, "Never measured, never managed."  If the company you choose can't defend through empirical evidence why a particular service or hardware is required, don't use them.    The hardware you purchase today should support your business for at least five years.  I often describe the credit card processing hardware like a good refrigerator or mattress.  You are going to use them for years, so get something robust, scalable and reliable.      Lastly, read CAREFULLY the contract terms.  It can cost you a bundle to terminate your contract.  And the term may be 3 or 4 years.  Don't let them skim over those terms and conditions.  Read and understand before you sign.

Muita gente cria patrimonio , e que gera custos futuramente , sem saber como pagar por isso depois , e no final acaba sem nada , ou at devendo.        Como voc est postando essa pergunta no tem de investimentos vou sugerir aplica??es para voc , ok ?     Olha , sua pergunta  muito vaga para te dar uma precis?o no que quer investir , pois n?o conheco seu perfil de investidor, valores, prazo de investimento , ou mesmo seu objetivo  ! Mas vou tentar responder da melhor forma possvel dentro de um padr?o financeiro , ok ?     NUNCA fa?a capitaliza??o !!!  uma grande roubada , pois seu dinheiro fica preso 2 ou 5 anos (depende do banco) , vc n?o pode mexer no dinheiro antes disso , mas caso precise , perde at 60% do dinheiro. N?o rende nada, somente a TR.   ------   Voc j est come?ando certo , que  se informar como poupar.   Atualmente esque?a a poupan?a, pois paga pouco (mesmo n?o descontando Importo de Renda)  melhor parar IR (Importo de Renda) e ter um lucro melhor.   ----------   Aprenda a seguinte palavra: JUROS COMPOSTOS.  mgico.   Se vc juntar R$ 3.500,00 por ms, em 10 anos vc pode ter R$ 1.000.000,00 !!! Isso mesmo .. vc pode se tronar uma milionlria. (Claro que R$ 1.000.000,00 em 10 anos n?o tem o mesmo poder de compra do que hoje, mas com o tempo vc pode aumentar a aplica??o mensal)   ----------   Hoje em dia quem est come?ando com pouco dinheiro ,  indicado fundos de Renda Fixa (rende mais , s que existe um risco maior), mas caso n?o queira NENHUM risco, aplique em fundos DI. timo para quem come?a.   Dependendo do valor que vc aplica , essas recomenda??es podem mudar.   Dependendo do valor , a??es podem valer muito , mas caso n?o tenha experincia nesse ramo , esque?a ... pode proporcionalmente PERDER muito.   ------------   A melhor forma de juntar dinheiro  , assim que vc receber , determina uma porcentagem do seu salrio (30% por exemplo) e guardar no mesmo dia.   No banco , vc pode determinar uma data e pedir para fazer aplica??o automtica. N?o cobra nada por isso ! Se cobrar , troque de banco. Fuja de fundos de previdncia para quem n?o tem aporte inicial grande , n?o  vantagem , pois eles n?o falam , mas na hora que vc coloca dinheiro l , eles descontam 5% para poder aplicar o dinheiro (que  a comiss?o dos corretores, que n?o s?o funcionrios do Bradesco , mas sim uma agencia corretora anonima).   --------   Sua pergunta est muito vaga , e tentei responder da melhor forma possivel.   Eu estou montando um site para instruir pessoas que tem as suas dvidas, que  www.igf.com.br !   Entre no tem calculadoras ,e veja se alguma te ajuda, caso contrrio , pe?a alguma que eu fa?o para vc !   Se mesmo assim n?o ajudar , me mande um e-mail que eu te ajudo.   Sou especialista em aplica??es e consultoria. (N?o se preocupe...rs... n?o vou cobrar nada, ok ?)   Boa sorte e parabns pela iniciativa.|`|a3fd315502b4e38d23c78135df06350baa	? Bruno, se eu acertasse os nmeros da Mega Sena, procuraria um profissional chamado gestor de fortunas em um banco, pois ele certamente seria a pessoa mais indicada para administrar o patrim?nio.  Esse profissional administra fortunas a partir de 3 milh?es de reais, na maioria dos bancos. Uma boa idia seria procurar uma corretora de investimentos, onde est?o os melhores profissionais do ramo.  A dica vale para a maioria dos ganhadores da Mega Sena - pessoas que n?o est?o acostumadas a lidar com valores milionrios. Contudo, h tambm milionrios que ficam mais ricos com premia??es da Loteria Federal e sabem muito bem onde e como investir suas fortunas para aument-las ainda mais.  Para se ter uma idia de como os gestores de fortunas s?o eficientes, saiba que a maioria deles n?o demora mais do que 4 anos para dobrar patrim?nios de at 20 milh?es de dlares.

A Motiva??o depende:    01 - Da objetividade e clareza na proposi??o do que se espera de resultados pela equipe e do que se oferece a ela em compensa??o ao esfor?o.(Quanto, O que; Como, Onde, Quando e Porqu).     02 - Da livre negocia??o de alguns aspectos facilitadores ou compensadores, pois num processo unilateral de defini??o fica difcil edificar o respeito e a considera??o mtua.    03 -  necessrio haver razoabilidade nesta proposi??o e  possibilidade prtica de alcan?ada dentro de condi??es que exijam esfor?o maior, mas nunca de excepcionalidade, sorte e condi??es extremadas.    04 -  preciso que haja uma rela??o justa e adequada entre Tamanho do Esfor?o/Recompensa proposta, que deve ser estimulante sem deixar de ser desafiadora.    05 - Uma vez definidas as metas e as recompensas, o acordo  estabelecido de Direitos e Obriga??es deve ser cumprido a risca.     06 -  necessrio haver mecanismos claros de mensura??o dos esfor?os e resultados (objetivos), sem elitismo ou discrimina??o (Concede pra um e rejeita para o outro). Se n?o houver Justi?a e Imparcialidade, dificilmente ser estabelecido o respeito e grande ades?o da equipe ou esfor?o conjunto.    07 - Da transparncia na divulga??o e no acompanhamento dos resultados.    08 - Da edifica??o de uma rela??o de trabalho onde h CONFIAN?A e RESPEITO entre as pessoas. Cara sria e fechada produz ou indiferen?a ou resistncia, quem n?o gosta de pessoas ou n?o sabe lidar com elas n?o conseguir motivar ningum.    09 - Necessidade de um eficaz controle disciplinar da equipe, exercido com ternura, porm com firmeza. O excesso de intimidade pode desvirtuar as rela??es de trabalho.    10 - Cumprir o que prometeu, para ter capacidade moral de exigir o combinado.    11 - PESSOAS n?o podem ser tratadas como COISAS. O ser humano deve ser valorizado e bem tratado em qualquer circunstancia, mesmo no caso de necessidade de desligamento.    12 -  Acima de tudo, para motivar pessoas  necessrio um lder, algum que n?o esteja preocupado apenas em cobrar resultados, e sim, atuar como facilitador, acompanhando DIA a DIA e LADO a LADO o desenvolvimento do trabalho.    Sem este requisito, a equipe nunca se sentir avaliada por um igual, que sabe os desafios e limita??es que o processo imp?e.    A presen?a do lder torna possvel uma percep??o e anlise crtica dos problemas e dificuldades, viabilizando a??es preventivas, corretivas ou melhorias de processos que facilitem o alcance dos resultados.    Quem deixa o desafio do trabalho para a equipe e lava as m?os, procurando depois s cobrar os resultados n?o  um gerente,  um CRETINO IMPOSTOR, que ainda n?o aprendeu que o EXEMPLO pessoal  a base da LIDERAN?A.

965c21285ffeb7d18cbfd458d0f09492aa	It all depends on what kind of trucking business you plan on starting.    If you are going to start a local only trucking business, then it should be the same as any other local business.    If it's going to be a statewide trucking business, there are some regulations that need to be followed, check with your state on that.    If you plan on starting an interstate trucking operation, even more regulations will come into play, insurance, cargo, fuel, and more taxes than you can shake a bank at.    It isn't really all that bad; nothing that a few weeks of filling out paperwork, filing registration forms, and paying fees couldn't overcome.    Good Luck!|`|AA10144492	The best routes to take are to research the process of starting a business as well as the industry you're interested in.    I recommend checking out the SBA, Entrepreneur, The Start Up Journal & Nolo. All 4 are great informational resources for the new/small business owner. I posted links for you in the source box.    Associations may be a good avenue to explore. These organizations will address many of the thoughts, questions and concerns you'll inevitably have as well as many you haven't anticipated yet. See the source box for some relevant links.     Research, research, research  this cannot be stressed enough. Read as much as you can about the industry. Here are some book titles that are relevant:    * How to Start & Manage an Independent Trucking Business: A Practical Way to Start Your Business by Jerre G. Lewis, Leslie D. Renn  * Start Your Own Freight Brokerage Business by Entrepreneur Press  * A Practical Guide to Transportation and Logistics by Michael B. Stroh  * Trucking Simplified (TOOLS AND STRATEGIES FOR RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL TRUCKING OPERATION) by Jeffery J. Woltman, Sheena P. Woltman    I also posted links to some free articles in the source box.     Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!|`|7e089e18f23d659d8e8c5c5d15f8a3aeaa	To open a trucking business you need trucks , warehouse space , tow motors , jacks , dollies , insurance , tax numbers , ICC permits , office supplies , and etc . You could probably start a small one for $100,000.00 and a good line of credit .
