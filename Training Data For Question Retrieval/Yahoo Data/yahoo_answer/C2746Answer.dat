A2IDiIpIaa	Martins Cages, the highest quality goods. It is from the USA so it will take a while to get there but the goods are top notch.  Martinscages.com|`|xtQkSimpaa	google homemade rat cages and there will be loads of ideas for you to make your own.|`|diMkiNNCaa	I agree with Andy, Martins is a great website!   However if you like that cage I'd think it would be cheaper to buy some fine mesh and cover the cage so the rats can't get out. Use some wire or zip ties(these are plastic) , and purchase the mess from Home Depot or Lowes.  you can find one fine enough that your rats can't get out of but with big enough holes for the wire or zip ties.  If you use wire make sure to fasten it on the OUTSIDE of the cage so it can't poke your ratties. Smooth sides should always be inside.   Zip ties work best if you pull them tight on the outside, and clip the ends.   The rats might chew them so keep some extras in case one gets worn out.   You can clip these with wire cutters or sharp scissors and save yourself some tolls and time. :)   Hope that helps!
znGpjsGjaa	I raise rabbits. some of my rabbits are pets and have been here a long time, they would be a little too tough and gamey to eat. Some of my rabbits are raised specifically for their meat. Meat rabbits are only raise to the age of 8-12 weeks. After that the meat gets "gamey" tasting and tougher the longer they live.    Rabbit meat is actually very tasty. It is actually one of the healthiest meats you can eat, very low in fat and high in protein.|`|tzwjSxGtaa	i've always wanted to eat something other than pigs, cows and chickens|`|GBy0W2YEaa	sich basterd|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	That's completely disgusting|`|5M57TTfpaa	my boyfriends grandfather breeds his rabbits for that purpose(all the bucks are wild), he has about 25, he waits til they are big them eats them and always brings them to thanksgiving and christmas dinners... ugh its disgusting. thats where i got my doe, i saved her=] when he let me pick one out and i picked her, the only black one, he was like, your lucky that one was next.|`|XI2iylR4aa	If you're even considering killing and eating your rabbit, then it's not a pet!

QZ3eucYWaa	How old is he? What are you feeding him? Do you have uvb available? What substrate are you using?Are the temps correct? - All of this and more play a role in why he may not be eating.  I have also learned that sometimes beardies just have their moments where they just don't feel like eaten. As long as it doesn't go for too long you should be okay though. It could also be that he is just relaxing from the stress of a new home, fighting with the other beardie, and now having the place to himself - he may be relieved and just chillin.    Here is some important info for you to take a look at  a small care sheet type thing I made up:  They need at least a 40g tank - this is for each. You should never house two bearded dragons together as they can and probably will end up fighting  if not at first, they will with time as they get territorial. They get big in size, plus this size tank will properly distribute the needed temps on the hot and cool side. The hot needs to be 90-100, the cool 80-90 (add 10 to both sides for juveniles). The temp can go into the 70s at night throughout the whole tank as this is the normal temp they are used to at night. Beardies also MUST have an UVB light 10-12 hours a day, and need to be able to get within 6-8 inches of it to properly receive its rays. UVB helps some reptiles properly digest their food and receive the nutrients, especially calcium from their food. DO NOT use any type of under the tank heater or heat rock for your dragon or in the tank. Bearded dragons do not have heat sensors on their underside and many have experienced serious burns, some life threatening, due to these items.  Any type of loose substrate is bad for a bearded dragon as it can cause impaction (http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/im... The best substrates to use are repti-carpet, outside carpet, tile, non-adhesive shelf liner, paper towel, and even felt. If you have a bearded who likes to dig, you can place a towel or some paper towel, or even a small blanket loosely where he likes to sleep. This will safely give him something to bury himself into. Here are some pics of my Spike with her favorite blanky, (http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... and http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... Beardies need both live food and salads on a DAILY basis. The salads should contain a mixture of greens, like collard greens and others plus an occasion of fruits and veggies mixed in. Visit http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.co... to get a listing of the foods that are good, and foods to stay away from. For the live foods NEVER feed your bearded meal worms or mice. Meal worms have too hard of an outer shell with very little meat inside making them hard to digest. Mice, no matter what size, are very fattening and have very hard bones that are hard to digest. A bearded dragons digestive track is VERY small and at one point has like a kink in it, anything that has not been digested properly up to this point can get stuck and cause impaction. This is why the rule of thumb as far as size of food, whether it be salads or live, is it should be no bigger than the space in-between their eyes. Some better choices for live food are crickets, super worms (only when beardie is big enough), wax worms (only as a treat as they are fattening), calci-worms, silk worms, and the best are turk and dubia roaches. A lot of people freak when they first hear about the roaches, but they are not like your house roaches. I have a colony of dubia roaches. They are clean, don't smell like crickets do, easy to care for, and reproduce for themselves! Here are some pics of my dubia colony. There are more pics that you can scan through, (http://picasaweb.google.com/dolphinsilve... Always gut load all live feeders before giving them to your beardie. Gut loading is pretty much just making sure that the feeders you are getting ready to feed to your bearded are full and have recently eaten themselves. This fattens them up, puts more meat on them, and makes them nutritionally better for your beardie.  Example: Take the crickets you bought and put them into a container with cricket feed, fish food, or crushed dog/cat food over night and then feed them to your beardie.  Humidity is bad for a beardie and should only be at 30% in the viv. They normally do not drink from a bowl, but I keep a small one in my Spikes viv just in case. In the wild they drink from falling water when it rains as it falls down leaves and such. They also get it from their food, and it is good to soak your beardie as much as possible. You can soak (or give your beardie a bath) your beardie in like a plastic container, in the sink, or in the tub  wherever is easiest and more convenient to keep a good eye on him/her. Be sure that the water stays warm  you can test the warmth of the water by letting it run along the inside of your wrist much like when you test a babys bot|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|f8t4FQZ5aa	This is generally normal for dragons (assuming its conditions are correct).

Um8osMNuaa	lf she's not showing any signs of illness and is otherwise acting normally, then she'll be fine, it sounds like she just likes the snow, my two Labs love to play in the snow. Just let her lay in it, she'll come inside to warm up when she gets too cold.  ls it the first time she's seen snow? if it is then it's all new and interesting to her.|`|y39iNwFjaa	She may just be fascinated with the snow or she may feel that she's over heating and want to cool her down. Take her to the vet as he can take her temperature and see what's going on!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I doubt there's anything wrong with her.  She enjoys the snow and she's asking to go out constantly so she can lay in it.  Lots of dogs do this, it's nothing to worry about if you haven't seen any symptoms of illness such as vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, significantly increased or decreased drinking or urination, or lack of appetite.|`|zrUbBiFdaa	it would really help if you told us what kind of dog she was. but a lot of dogs really do love the snow so i wouldnt worry.|`|1a03fd470e002c088b333c229350271faa	Nope, I don't think so, it sounds like she's just one of those dogs that LOVES the snow!    The only reason to be worried would be if she is urinating every time she gets out there, if she is going out that often and urinating, she could have a urinary tract infection. But other than that, I think she's just a snow dog!|`|J9AvKefwaa	i wouldn't think so, unless she was showing other signs of being unwell like off her food, panting all the time etc? Does she seem too hot or feverish? maybe your house is too warm for her and the snow cools her down...|`|DQkDQraOaa	She must like the sanow. My dog loves it!|`|j1rHxflaaa	Probably just wants to go out, walk her more|`|TLzbS8AIaa	No, she probably just has a thing for snow.  If she were sick, she probably wouldn't feel like doing anything, especially go outside.|`|TweZlF73aa	NO i don't think so. Dogs just get over heated sometimes and they love to kool off or play in the snow... Go out and play with her. now that'd be interesting lol|`|3JLg1tcRaa	My dog used to do this... a lot of dogs LOVE snow and love to play in it and roll around in it.  And sometimes he would just lay there for awhile too.  If she's a fluffy dog I wouldn't worry too much... it's just something new that she wants to play with.|`|QJduXC4Kaa	She is just playing; she likes the snow and also loves the fact that whenever she tells you that she wants to go out you open the door for her, that is another way of getting attention from you, but she is perfectly okay, my two bullies love snow as well.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	she's probably fine. If she were unwell, she would be showing other signs, not wanting to go out. She no doubt just wants to play and loves the snow.  One of mine sticks her face in the snow and snorts.....dogs just like to play.    Enjoy it!|`|AA11449595	if your dog has never experienced snow before then its going to want to sniff it or play in it.or she likes snow or the outdoors nothing should be wrong with her or she hot and wants to cool down|`|AA11926782	Call your vet.|`|AA12196196	I don't think anything's wrong with her. Some dogs just absolutely adore snow. My dog was always happiest outside when there was snow on the ground. Normally she would do her business then look around and bark or want to come back in. With snow on the ground though, she would stay out there happily for a long time, even hours. Dogs that are built for snow are often made for snow, and therefore have an intense love of snow.  As long as your dog isn't getting cold and shivering out there yet still staying outside, you have no reason for concern. If she is getting really cold out there yet not wanting to come in, there could be something wrong. A healthy dog knows when enough is enough.|`|AA12323391	Mine is starting to do this unexepectedly too.  This is a change and he digs his nose in the snow and stays out for a long time.  Feels like something may be wrong but maybe he's overheated?  A week ago he wouldn't stay out for more than a few minutes and definitely wouldn't beg to go out.
ltP1gO4taa	Get this dog back to the vet ASAP.  It could be any number of things, but it's not normal.  It could be the pain meds, or god forbid nerve damage of some sort.|`|y39iNwFjaa	Take him to the vet. This is not normal. He may have an infection> Good luck :)|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Vet NOW!|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	I would call your vet and make an appointment to have him seen today.    Complications can arise with any surgery and the symptoms your dog is displaying need to be assessed so that he can get the proper treatment.     Some dogs don't whine with pain. My border collie had to have a toe amputated after developing infected arthritis at the age of two from a tiny piece of broken glass getting in his paw and making its way to the joint. All that pain and he couldn't walk on it, but didn't cry or whine once whenever dressings were changed or he was examined.    Please get him to the vet now. The shaking alone is a sign that something is not right and it could be caused by shock or infection, but this should not be ignored.    Hope he's better soon.|`|J9AvKefwaa	it sounds like the dog isn't well and there is some problem. go back to the vet and make them check him out. he shouldn't need pain medication for being neutered, its a routine op and not something that require any medication.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Take your dog to the vet now.  Not tomorrow, not at 5pm this evening, as soon as your vet opens (call them first to let them know you are coming).  What you are describing is NOT normal and could be a sign that your dog is ill or had a complication with the anesthesia or the pain meds.  He needs to be examined by a vet and your vet needs to run bloodwork to see if his organs are functioning correctly.  If you ignore this, your pet could suffer long term damage or possibly even die.|`|jmCwOE6daa	You really should ask professionals instead of random people from Y!answers. Poor dog, hope he's okay.|`|r5dK8PV6aa	i have two pugs and they are very prone to illness and what ever is going around. I think they always look sad but i understand you mean more than usual. I have worked with a lot of dogs and cats being neutered but i cant say i have encountered this problem as usually with in a day or so they are acting like normal.  In the case that you say i would suggest getting him looked at quickly incase of infection or something but usually the anesthetic wears off witin the day, maybe groggy for a few but not falling over or in pain as the actual op shouldn't be that painful after.  check around the operated area for any sign of redness and abnormal swelling and heat. it should be warm but if its hot then you will have something worth worrying about. Other than that only a vet can tell you. sorry|`|AA12196196	You should take him back to the vet. At the very least call them and ask about the symptoms. It doesn't sound normal to me. He should be in some discomfort, but not enough to make him shake, or drag his legs. Or it could be that his meds are messing with how awake and alert he feels. Some dogs can be sensitive to medication.

vkYAttbGaa	Besides giving your hamster his dry hamster mix, you can also give him fruits and vegetables.  However, you'll need to start out slow.  If you feed your hamster too many fruits and vegetables, he'll get diarrhea.  Start out by giving your hamster one small piece of fruit or vegetable 3 times per week.  After about 4 weeks, then you can give your hamster one small piece of fruit or vegetable every day.  Here's a list of safe fruits and vegetables for hamsters (from petwebsite.com):    Alfalfa   Apple (seedless)   Asparagus   Avocado (skinned and seedless)   Banana   Basil   Blackberries   Blueberries   Broccoli   Brussel Sprouts - small amounts occasionally - not all hamsters like the strong taste   Calabrese   Cabbage - should only be fed in small amounts occasionally as too much can cause health problems   Carrots   Cauliflower leaves and stalks   Celery   Cherries - stones should be removed as they can be dangerous if gnawed   Chestnuts   Chicory   Chinese Leaves   Coriander   Corn-on-the-Cob   Corn Salad   Courgette   Cranberries   Cress   Cucumber   Curly Kale   Dates   Endive   Fenugreek   Feijoa   Figs   Grapes   Green beans   Kale - should only be fed in small amounts occasionally as too much can cause health problems   Kidney Beans (cooked)   Kiwi Fruit   Kumquat   Lettuce - small amounts occasionally - in excess it can cause liver problems   Logan Berries   Lychee   Mange Tout   Mango   Marrow   Melon   Mint   Mung   Okra   Pak Choy   Papaya   Parsley - a good tonic   Peach   Pear   Peas   Plums - stones should be removed as can be dangerous when gnawed   Potato (cooked)   Raspberries   Raspberry Plant leaves - beneficial for diarrhoea   Rhubarb (cooked)   Rocket Chard   Sage   Sorrel   Squash   Star Fruit   Strawberries   Sugar Cane - small amounts   Sweet Potato   Soybean Sprouts   Swede   Sweetcorn   Sweet Peppers   Ugli Fruit   Turnip   Water Chestnuts   Watermelon   Water Spinach     If a fruit or vegetable is not on this list, consider it unsafe for your hamster.  (Better safe than sorry!)    As far as exercise, make sure your hamster has a solid wheel, which is more comfortable for his feet.  If your hamster has a wire wheel with rungs, replace it with a solid wheel.  Also, you might want to buy a hamster run-around ball, available in pet stores for around $6.  If you have a Syrian hamster (also known as a Teddy Bear hamster, a Black Bear hamster, or a Golden hamster), the ball should have an 8" diameter.  If you have a dwarf hamster, choose a ball for dwarves.    Let your hamster run in the ball for about 15 minutes 1-2 times per day.  Make sure there are no stairs around, and if you have other pets such as a cat or dog, make sure they are out of the room where your hamster is.|`|a4dN8qbFaa	you can.

8xVGuEDkaa	Sounds Like within the week, the best thing to do is get some towels and put them in her favorite spot to hide, she is gonna want to be alone when she births them, but won't put up much of a fight if you help her, but only is she really trusts you.|`|w1kvhxX5aa	wow stop right there you gotta actually take it in to a vet to tell how far along it is|`|zrUbBiFdaa	i'd say withing a matter of days, make sure to provide her with a box to have her kittens in and make sure it has lots of towels or news paper. i hope all goes well ^-^|`|j2yHX3mOaa	Sounds like any day now or in the next week, keep an eye on her make sure the discharge is not smelly or dark colour. She sounds too me too be fine, make sure you have a medium size box with some blankets in it ready for her to get used to for when her time comes, and that she's warm and comfortable, feed her as much as she wants (she's feeding for her kittens as well) cats are really good mothers in my experience and when she goes into labour just watch over her dont intervene unless kittens are showing any distress. Good luck xx|`|9dlRcS7caa	Probably within this week, you should prepare a box where she would be comfortable to give birth. Put some clean newspapers or towel.

J9AvKefwaa	totally ignore the comment about sticking her nose in it. this was something people used to do 20 years ago before things moved on and more humane and effective ways evolved.     this factsheet from the blue cross is very good.     House-training an adult dog  Through no fault of their own, some pet dogs reach adulthood without being fully house trained. Fortunately, with time and patience, it is possible to establish new habits and teach your dog to stay clean in the house.  Not all dogs are house trained  Although it is quite easy to house train a puppy, things can and do go wrong with this process if not carried out correctly. With some dogs, it may not have been attempted at all if, for example, they were kennelled outside. Consequently, some pet dogs reach adulthood having not been fully house trained. Luckily, in most cases, it is a simple matter to house train an adult dog and new habits can be established quickly. However, it does require time and patience, and a dedicated owner determined to succeed. How long it takes depends on:  how well the owner keeps to the routine   how quickly the dog learns   how old your dog is   what experience your dog has had in the past                          Other reasons for not being clean in the house  As well as not being house trained, there are many other reasons why a dog will go to the toilet in the house. Some of these are:  stress and tension in the household   anxiety about being left alone   territory marking   Symptoms of lack of house training  Usually just a few areas in the house are used as the toilet. These are usually near the exit or entry points of the rooms used and the dog will return to these sites again and again.     Some dogs may urinate and defecate in the house, or urinate in the house only and defecate outside, while others will defecate in the house but not urinate. Usually, but not always, the dog will sneak away to go to the toilet, rather than go in front of humans. The dog may do this at any time, not just when left alone in the house.  Even after a walk, the dog may come back to the house and go to the toilet.  What to do  Before starting the new routine  Carefully clean all areas your dog has previously soiled using a warm solution of biological washing powder (for example, a teaspoon of powder dissolved in a cup of warm water) or a specially formulated product from your vet, which will remove all traces of the smell from your house.  Every day  When you first wake up, last thing at night and every hour during the day, take your dog outside to a place in your garden that you have chosen and let your dog walk up and down or run about and sniff the area (both exercise and sniffing helps stimulate elimination).     Put soiled newspaper or faeces in this area so that the smell tells your dog where to go next time. Stay out with your dog and patiently walk up and down for at least five minutes. If your dog starts to go to the toilet, give praise. It is important that, for the first two weeks, there is constant supervision so that your dog cannot go to the toilet in the house.     During the times that you cannot supervise your dog or when you go to sleep, confine the dog to bed. You need to find a suitable way to do this, either by restricting them to bed with a barrier, or investing in an indoor kennel. A dog will become accustomed to this, without making a noise or trying to break out, when left there for short periods of time.     Few dogs soil their own bed and, if confined to bed, they are unlikely to relieve themselves. Although it is unfair to confine them for long periods, this does provide a way of preventing them from soiling the house for short periods when you cannot supervise. This avoids perpetuating bad habits at times when you need to concentrate on other things.     Between trips to the garden, supervise your dog continually when in the house. This means keeping your dog in view at all times and being aware of what the dog is doing. When unable to supervise, confine them to bed, but do not leave your dog there for long periods of time.  When you see your dog about to toilet in the house  If about to go to the toilet indoors, take your dog immediately to your chosen place in the garden and praise the dog by giving a food treat or a game with a favourite toy. It is essential your dog associates going to that place with a reward. Catching in time means your dog will still need to go. Wait until the dog has performed and praise well.  When you find a puddle or mess  Do not punish your dog for any accidents discovered too late. It may make you feel better but it is most unpleasant for your dog and ultimately does not teach anything. Consider that these accidents are now your fault rather than the dogs since you were not supervising closely enough.     You need to continue with this routine for at least two weeks. During this time, your dog learns about getting praise for going to the toilet outside and, since there is n|`|zrUbBiFdaa	take her our every hour and don't bring her in until she wees, when she does praise her and take her inside. what ever you do don't get mad at her for going indoors, rewarding a dog does much better than disciplining a dog when it comes to training.|`|SdJEVO53aa	if she does, stick her nose in it, after about 5 times shell stop, it worked with both of my dogs|`|fc76816ec74874b1d44f6e87125ce2baaa	Firstly how old is she? Cause it is usually about 4 months when a pup can recognise the feeling of needing to wee and can hold it for any length of time.  I couldnt advocate crate training enough, it really makes house breaking a lot easier, this is because dogs generally dont go near to where they sleep. Keep her in there at night, wake up early and let her straight out, dont let her stop and sniff in the house. Then when it comes to feeding time, feed her in the crate, leave her in there for about a hour, then straight out again. It really does work. The one thing I will say is though never use the crate as a means of punishment, only associate it with good things.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	You don't give an age so ...    Rule of Thumb:  You puppy can hold it for 1 hour longer than it is in age(months); i.e.; 3 months, 4 hours.    Please steam clean your carpet using Rug Doctor's Pet Odor and Spot Remover.  Then use White Vinegar to clean any further accidents.    Please read:    http://www.dogstardaily.com-train-aft    It's a FREE download that you should find very helpful!!!|`|AA12149194	As others have pointed out, with no age listed, it makes it a little more difficult to give advice... But as someone else said, take her age and add one to determine how long she can go without using the bathroom.    You need to take her outside within the time frame and stand there with her until she uses the bathroom... Praise her before taking her back inside when she does and give her a treat.  If she has an accident on the rug, simply clean it up and ignore her for the next several minutes (About 10 minutes should be fine), not giving her any positive or negative attention... The same goes for any kind of bad behavior as well. If she starts barking or behaving in a manner that isn't okay, you ignore her until she stops and praise her and give her attention when she does.    You could also spend a few dollars on puppy training pads... When it's time for her to use the bathroom, take her to them until she goes (Or if there's a certain area that she usually relieves herself in, which was the case with my dog, put them there) and when she pees on them, again, praise her. They work and it'll give her a place to use the bathroom when you can't take her outside and if she's young, she'll likely need it.. Slowly move the pad(s) toward the door and then stop putting them down... She'll become used to peeing on the pads and once they're gone, she'll have no other option but outside when you take her.     Just make sure that you give her plenty of praise when she pees in the right place and don't give her any when she pees on the carpet.

M3H4NtrAaa	If you wont want a dog when your 16 you obviously dont really want one now either. Dogs are for life. They live for at least 10-12 years. Your not mature enough to own one. Wait until you have grown up and have a place of your own and can afford all the food, expensive vets bills, etc etc. You just like the idea of a dog.    EDIT** I dont really care about the problems in your life. I just got out of a psychiatric hospital for trying to kill myself 4 times. You asked a question and this is my answer. Tens of thousands of dogs are put down every year because irresponsible people like you get dogs and then decide they dont want them. Buy a plant instead and it doesnt matter if you kill it or dump it on the side of the road.     I am so fed up of stupid immature children like you asking stupid questions like this.|`|h2HtZ9NMaa	Show her that you are responsible|`|W0buucLsaa	You need to call the animal control officer in your town or the local SPCA branch about that woman - preferably the SPCA branch, if you have one in your area. She needs to be introduced to the long arm of the law. Your desire for a dog (while I totally empathize, loving dogs and having been young once myself) is secondary to the welfare of this particular animal. He could die from starvation or abuse.    Get the phone book out, look up the SPCA and animal control officer, and call. NOW. (Or during working hours.) Make sure you have the woman's address ready.    As a bonus, such a mature move might make your mother rethink her position.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	You need to show your mum that you can be responsible and yes, you've kept your cat alive, but she obviously feels like you're not doing enough. Speak to her, ask her what it will take for her to reconsider and whatever she says, do it. Keep at it for three years if that's how long it takes for her to change her mind. She needs to see you are committed as a dog is not like a cat, it needs far more attention, training and time from you including all the walks and paying for food, insurance and vets bills.    Also, with your neighbors dog, this is your chance to show how responsible you really are and either call your local spca centre to report the abuse and neglect to your neighbors dog or ask your mum to call them for you. Don't ask her if you can have this dog, your mum will be worried about the old, abusive owners living in the street. Just call the spca and let them take care of the dog and find it a new home.    Good luck!|`|dwHnazEJaa	Oh the poor thing. I convinced my parents to let me get a dog, if i got an 85 Average in school by the summer. And i can do that.

Thier jus being stupid.|`|aCqSF87Raa	What a rant...    Several things bother ME about this and i'm sure these are the reasons your mom has given you about WHY she says no at this point.    1) You approached a strange dog.    Big No-No even for ME, and i love dogs to death. It doesn't matter if the dog belonged to the neighbors, chances are YOU never personally met them or conversed about their pets. That dog could have been a stray THEY took in.    Point being the dog could have had health problems, the dog could have had behavioral problems, the dog could have turned and bitten you or your friend for any reason: you didn't know.     Never approach a strange dog OR a dog you don't personally know. PERIOD.    2) You FED a strange dog.    You don't know anything about this dog. Some breeds are naturally thin (have you even seen a greyhound?) Some dogs are on special diets. Some dogs are on food restrictions. Some dogs are on medications.    You ASSUMED that thin meant starved, but if all the other dogs were healthy why would just that ONE be starved? By feeding the dog you could have disrupted a feeding schedule, you could have caused stomach upset, etc.    As for the dog going through your cans, ANY dog that's out and about would be attracted to garbage. Some dogs are total gluttons. Point is: you didn't know.    3) Your whole second paragraph bugs me.    First you state mom says "wait till your 16", but then you go on to say "but by then, i won't want a dog for sure" - what do you think, a dog you get now won't be around then? That whole comment makes me (and probably your mom) think that you aren't serious about a dog and will "get over" the novelty by that time.    Dogs live 10-15+ years and you will definately have one THEN if you get one NOW.    Second you state that you're jealous of your friends, and THAT is a poor reason to get a dog. That's like saying "my friends get to jump off the bridge but i don't, so i wanna go do it!" You don't get a dog, know what it feels like for a while, then dump it.    Period.    I say good for your mom to tell you no. You don't sound anywhere NEAR ready to have a dog if your main concern is about getting one NOW instead of later as well as about your friends and what they have versus what you have.    PS - If you're concerned about the state of an animal, you do not take matter into your own hands - at least not as a teen. You report the situation to the proper authorities for THEM to deal with SAFELY and LEGALLY.|`|oHGgNlyIaa	Let them know that you are definitely responsible enough to handle the responsibility of owning a pet. Do chores around the house to prove you are responsible. Offer to help with the extra housecleaning and vacuuming. Dogs can be messy, especially before they're housebroken. Most dogs will shed. Since it is you who wants a dog, you should make the extra effort.  List the benefits of having a dog:    * The dog will help you to be responsible.  * The dog can become a companion for the whole family.  * Walking a dog can help you get more exercise.  * Dogs can sometimes be trained to perform useful tasks  * Dogs can be therapeutic, especially during sad or lonely times    Then, convince your parents that you are saving a life by adopting a shelter dog. You are saving a dog that will have been killed next week. Think about it.Let everyone 'think' about it a few days, and then try visiting a local dog shelter.    Remember, a dog will make a great friend!    Good Luck! I got a dog this way! He's a cute little baby lab!  (only, he's gonna get bigger)|`|VxhknQjEaa	I would say to tell her that you will take good care of it and that she doesn't need to worry about anything that has to do with the dog.|`|2pVr6J3Eaa	I dont know what age you are but your already saying that when your 16 you wont want a dog! Taking on a dog is a huge commitment some of them live for over 15 yrs. So I'd really think hard about if its the right thing for you right now. I know how you feel tho I wanted a dog forever but we just didnt have the space,I have one now but shes alot of work.  If your really determined you want one tho maybe show your mother that you can be responsible,maybe help her round the house ect and u never know she might think your mature enough in a few months.  Good Luck!|`|1MhYKhf4aa	I made a deal with my mom to let me have a dog when I was your age - I told her the dog would live in my room so it wouldnt mess up her carpets or house  and I would pay for all its food out of my allowance and take it to the vet - she agreed and I lived up to that bargin - I had to spend practically my whole allowance to feed it - and I walked it every day for long periods of time - we were good for each other - but you have to remember a dog is not a one day or one year commitment - they live 15 or more years - and who will take care of it if you go to college?

You're exactly like me, my Mom says I can't have a dog until I'm 16, or when I get married and moved out, >.>    Anyways, just show her you're responsible! Do chores, and good in school.

What I did was draw pictures of me and a dog and convinced my dad  to let me get a dog but my mom wasnt convinced so i did extra chores around the house and got paid. I saved money up and bought dog gates for areas you dont want your dog in and set them up myself and she felt sorry for me so I kept it up for not eating in a day AND SHE FINALLY CRACKED and i adopted mine from the pound but your rescue mission seems more helpful

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    I know how frustrating this must be for you.     Whenever a cat begins to display a new elimination issue, such as the one you describe, the first thing to do is to have the the kitten or cat evaluated by a vet. Cats, just like humans can get urinary tract infections or bladder stones. I had a kitty who had both, and used the litter box sometimes, but peed on the bed and carpet near the bed often as well. Our vet did a urine and blood test and found that she had a UTI, was treated, and has not forsaken the litter box again.    Once you rule out a medical reason for this behavior, one can assume that is a behavioral issue. You don't mention if he is "spraying" ( vertical urination with tail lifted and shaking) or sitting and urinating horizontally.  If it is vertical he is more than likely "spraying" and he may be sexually mature, even at that age. Neutering should fix this problem, but once the habit becomes ingrained, even neutered cats can continue. (sigh). But there are medications that can help with this issue.    Cleaning the area thoroughly is essential, no matter what is causing it. I recommend that you get a black light, which is available from most pet stores, or amazon.com, which will flouresce the areas where he is urinating. Using the light will make them glow bright green, so you know exactly where they are. Then follow up with an enzymatic urine removal product, also available at petstores or amazon.com and follow the directions on the bottle carefully. You need to remove all traces of scent so he is not attracted back to the area.    Black light resource link  http://www.pet-discount-supply.com/dogs/...  Enzymatic Fluid:  http://www.cheappetstore.com/Cats-Kitten...    So while this may be territorial marking, at the same time you need to make sure that there is nothing medically wrong first.    Good luck to you, and hope you get this problem solved quickly.

It could be that he has a urinary tract infection which is quite common in cats. When cats have them, it's common for them to urinate in the house where they shouldn't - it's their way of letting you know something is wrong. My friend's cat always does this when she's ill.    In any cae, it might be an idea to take him to the vet and ask about it, because if he does have an infection it will be causing him a lot of discomfort and it's easily cleared up with antibiotics.    EDIT: to examine the urine closely you'll need to take your kitty to the vet and they will either try to get a urine sample there or they may just put him on antibiotics as a precaution without looking at the urine.|`|8pLDp9rOaa	Hi  Are you sure he's not spraying rather than weeing?

Take your cat to the veterinarian for a good examination.  Be sure to tell your veterinarian about the house-soiling problem.  If your cat gets a clean bill of health, here are a few things you can consider:    Litter cleanliness: Be sure you keep the litter box very clean.  Cats are clean animals and some may want their box meticulous.  This may mean scooping 1-2 times daily and/or changing the entire material every 3-4 days.    Litter box location:  Check around where the litter box is to be sure that there is not something about the location that the cat may find a problem.  This could be a noisy appliance, people walking by, the dog approaching, nearby children playing, or other cats in the household.    Disharmony between housemates:  In a home with multiple cats, there may be subtle underlying tensions that may make one or more cats anxious.  This could lead to non-litter box usage.    Continued use of one particular material:  If your cat has been eliminating outside of the litter box for some time, it may have developed a preference for another material besides litter.  If you think this is the case, consult your veterinarian for help or a referral to a veterinary behaviorist or an applied animal behaviorist.
opjYENGGaa	I know what you mean, the weather in Melbourne is ridiculous lately. I'll have yet again, another sleepless night. My dog and puppy have been laying on the tiles (in fact they are there right now) to keep cool. What you can do though is get a couple of towels and wet them; squeeze most of the water out and put it down on the tiles for your dog to lay down on. That is how I've been keeping my dogs cool these past few days. During the day you can squirt them with a cool water bottle, hose, put ice blocks in their water ect.    It's not going to get any lower than 30 tonight. :(|`|N6NunLGVaa	If you can take him near a body of water (threes usually a breeze there) and he can run in the water. Dogs sweat through there paws so have him step in cool water. i know my Caren loves to chew on ice, see if he'll eat some ice. Also see if your yard is cooler than your home. keep him in the color space.  Hope your dog is ok Tomorrow|`|AA10852135	Fans!!! Cool towels. Lots of fresh cool water.    If you can afford it buy a cooling mat for them.    We always keep a few large tubs of water out for the dogs to splash in - they love it. We also get the hose out and let them have a good play in the water.    Maybe a Kong, freeze some treats in it over night. Our dogs love them and they take a while to chew through. Though for a Staffy you'd wanna get the right size kong.|`|36c7247679a853a5f8f5039bbfa74097aa	Everyone's ideas are pretty spot on, the only thing i usually do to keep my dogs cool is I have one of those baby shell/clam pools for them to lay in, which you can pick up from any kmart store for about $25. Just make sure it's in the shade so the sun doesnt heat the water too much :)|`|AA10412922	Use luke warm water to wet your dog down,cold water constricts the blood vessels on the surface and is less effective for cooling the dog down.|`|Um8osMNuaa	Ice helps to keep them cool, put ice cubes in his water bowl, and give him some to chew on.

b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	It could be a number of things.    One could be that she's struggling to digest food. Ensure you provide enough grit to aid their digestion. You may need to massage her crop. If it feels full and rock solid, syringe some olive oil down her throat and massage the crop to help it breakdown. If her tail is up, looking active then I wouldn't worry. If she's withdrawn, hunched up etc she could have crop implications (sour or impacted) in which case treatment is required to prevent or treat any infection.    The other possibility is that she has gapeworm and the motion that you describe is a symptom. Have they been wormed recently? If not, put her on a course of Flubenvet, the most effective product for treating all types of worm infestations for chickens. Other symptoms would be a healthy appetite but a loss of weight and poor quality droppings.    Best of luck!|`|8GDd6lrnaa	look up Avian Leukosis.|`|mXecXR06aa	change the food and give her more water and keep it clean
VFx4YHFEaa	DO NOT WORRY! this is called NEW TANK SYNDROME.    In established aquariums, just as in nature, toxic ammonia from Turtle waste is broken down by bacteria into nitrite, which is itself broken down by a different group of bacteria into nitrate. In a newly set up aquarium, those bacteria are not present in any quantity, and it takes time - about a 4 to 6 weeks under normal circumstances - for those bacteria to multiply to the point of being able to keep up with the waste output of theTurtle. New Tank Syndrome and The Break-In Cycle describe the period in which ammonia and then nitrite levels rise to dangerous quantities before being converted into relatively harmless nitrate.

First thing in the morning, take her for a walk, the body movement will stimulate bowel movements and she will go. Give her a good 30 minute walk. Do the same later in the day and let her out in between. If you can, give her a walk up the road as often as you can too.    Don't forget your poo bags!    She'll be fine, just clean up the house well and walk, walk, walk!
ltP1gO4taa	Just get a regular collar.  Magnet Therapy is the modern day Snake Oil.  The giveaway is that when you Google "Magnet Therapy" virtually every site that comes up is selling the products. There's only been one major study that supports magnet therapy, but only a specific strength magnet to treat a specific type of swelling at a specific depth below the skin.  Even the guy that conducted the study doesn't endorse it.    A study on humans of static field strengths up to 1 T found no effect on local blood flow.    A trial of magnetic therapy for the treatment of wrist pain from carpal tunnel syndrome and chronic low back pain did not find any health benefits above placebo.    A 2003 Cochrane Review of carpal tunnel syndrome treatments found no improvement in symptoms over placebo or control.    A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of 101 adults diagnosed with plantar heel pain carried out in year 2003 found no significant difference in outcome between use of active vs. sham magnets.    A randomized controlled trial found a statistically significant effect using non-magnetic and weak magnetic bracelets as controls against strong magnets in the management of pain from osteoarthritis of the hip and knee. The study could not conclude whether the response was due to non-specific placebo effects.    A 2002 U.S. National Science Foundation report on public attitudes and understanding of science noted that magnet therapy is "not at all scientific." A number of vendors make unsupported claims about magnet therapy by using pseudoscientific and new-age language. Such claims are unsupported by the results of scientific and clinical studies.  A 2007 study suggested that application of 10 or 70, but not 400 mT, static magnetic fields reduced histamine-induced edema formation in rats.    The typical magnet used produces insufficient magnetic field to have any effect on muscle tissue, bones, blood vessels, or organs.    Some manufacturers claim that the magnets help to circulate the blood by interacting with the iron in hemoglobin, a major component of red blood cells. There is no indication that circulatory benefits would result even if some blood component were to couple strongly to magnetic fields.    Others claim that the magnets can restore the body's theorized "electromagnetic energy balance", but no such balance is medically recognized.    Even in the many times stronger magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging, none of the claimed effects are observed.    There are claims that the south pole of a magnet acts differently on the body than the north pole.    Many of the websites that promote the benefits of magnetic therapy belong to individuals and companies that profit from the sale of magnetic therapy products.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Don't know if this is any use / help?

oUcLSDZ6aa	Adult food is less fatty than kitten food, which explains some weight loss.   As for the clingy/whinyness, congratulations, your cat is in heat.     I would still swing by the vet to check on the weight loss, where as 2.4 pounds in such a short period of time may or may not be cause for concern, but it's better to know than to guess.      ADDED:  Being spayed doesn't mean the cat won't go into heat, she'll still go through the motions of it, she just can't have babies. My cat is 15 years old and still goes into heat, despite the fact that she is fixed.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	that is a very significant weight loss for 1 month.

HAVE THE CAT EVALUATED BEFORE THE CAT BECOMES OVERTLY SICK."  ~~~  I would take the kitten to the vet immediately because there something seriously wrong with your kitten!!  ~~~  Cats should not lose more than 8oz(half a pound) a month or they will get fatty liver disease.     "Cats have a unique metabolic response to fasting and whenever a felines food intake is rapidly and markedly depressed, a serious and potentially fatal disorder can occur called  Hepatic Lipidosis."    "Always be observant and report to your veterinarian any time a cat stops eating for two or more days.  (Thats one of the subtle problems with the free choice method of feeding.  We often do not notice that the cats food dish is still full until the cat is well into a fasting mode.  When cats are sick the first clinical sign is often a loss of appetite; so a non-interactive, free choice feeding protocol provides less information to us than an interactive portion controlled feeding method.)  Any cat that hasnt eaten in three days is in trouble!  Seven days of fasting actually impacts the cats immune system."|`|5O1HtiqAaa	i would take her to the vet couse u never know    hope she gets better    love kitkat|`|rrPRegiyaa	i think she sounds fine but go to the vet just to be sure|`|lFPsPzxzaa	ask a vet|`|ZlYmbAVQaa	nothing majorly wrong by the things you have told me, but take her to the vets just incase|`|CRhS02q8aa	Cats can be a lot like people...some are very needy and some dont care much for attention.

SZOMVGBRaa	Yes you will be fine, I kept 2 males ina 55 gallon before with a host of other fish. As long as the both have places to hide on each end ot the tank the fights will never get bad enough to kill them. You will see them go at each other occasionally but its mostly for show.   Good Luck|`|Zwg6T2wvaa	Theirs always a chance something could go wrong. but I'm going to say they'll be fine. 50 gallons is more than enough room. chances are they'll stay way away from each other.

They did a research/science project in China, I believe, where they took two male Betta's and put tracking devices on them. They made a lake in a field, I believe something like 2-3 miles wide and placed each betta at separate ends of the lake. It seemed a bit as though that each betta could sense the other was their as they pretty much made their way directly towards each other and then fought to the death. They are not called fighting fish because they are lovers.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	I think I will side with Dolphins on this as there is a lot of logic in the answer. They don't try to hide from each other, give them a mirror and they will fight themselves. If both parties want to fight, it's going to happen.    Adding three maybe four females in a tank that size should be OK if it's well planted. Males show a fear of open water, being poor swimmers.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Assuming the other fish you plan to have in the tank are OK with bettas, it should work all right. In a tank that big, the bettas will be able to get away from each other before one of them gets killed.  In nature, bettas don't fight to the death-- only until one of them flees from the other's territory.|`|H06PtiIAaa	it can be done, but the question is why would you ever want to take the chance.    i have keep two male plakats in a 20 with alot of females, but it isnt worth the risk.
yCR6qg0baa	Hey,     Even if your landlord knew you had pets, they probably wouldn't treat your little infestation. But you can treat it yourself. =)    There are a variety of flea powders, sprays, and wall plug ins that you could use. There are some that specifically say "Safe around pets & kids". You can buy these at Walmart, Target,, Hardware stores, etc. They're not very expensive. If that doesn't work, call a local exterminator & they have a spray that smells like an orange grove & kills the fleas within 3 days. Also, treat your cats with Frontline if you haven't already. Once you notice dead fleas on the carpet, start vacuuming every day. Vacuum your couch with the attachments. Sprinkle flea powder under the cushions. Wash all of your clothes & bedding in hot water. Wash anything you can with bleach. Wear pants & long sleeves & put "Off" or a similar product around your ankles, wrists, and ears. And until your little problem is gone, don't visit anyone else with pets-- you could spread them to your friends' houses.     We're in the process of buying our first house. We've been in apartments for the 2 years we've been married. We also have a cat the landlord doesn't know about b/c a non-refundable deposit & a monthly fee is ridiculous. So I understand your position. Good luck!|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	You can buy space sprays and "bombs"  We've found water traps to be very effective.  A cereal bowl of water with a couple of drops of washing up liquid in it to break the surface tension.  Stand the bowls, with small table lamps, around the house in the carpeted areas, close to a power point.   Have the shade projecting as far over the water as possible.  When you go to bed at night, switch on.  In the morning, switch off and count the number of drowned fleas.  At the height of an infestation we were "netting" around 20 at a time in the bowl on the landing outside our bedroom  P.S. keep vacuuming - we have a transparent cylinder on ours and you could see the fleas jumping around.  Empty out into your bin/trash can asap.  My cats were also indoor cats!|`|2pVr6J3Eaa	There is a powder you can get as far as I remember and you sprinkle it everwhere and hoover it up.Plus theres a flea treatment you can get from the vets that you put on the back of the cats necks that makes the fleas unable to breed,so then you'll only be left killing off the old ones|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	Sevin Dust|`|5tIHMd8kaa	get a carpet cleaner service, or by those carpet cleaning vaccums from walmart.

ZNDqYUwkaa	I would not take the risk of waiting if he has started losing weight rapidly.  Does he get wormed regularly?    There could be many different reasons for sudden weight loss, but all need attention and that attention should come from a vet.    Call yourself a taxi or have a friend or neighbor take you to the vet. If this vet is too busy, call another vet and that one is too busy, call another one.    If you have no other option, call your local animal/dog charity, explain the situation and you'll have to still pay for any treatment, but I'm pretty sure they will help you.

K0uTjeWiaa	Hi   No sugar for cats. Vegetables have no benefits for cats and beware of stuff like con which converts to sugar. Milk is no better for cats then it is for dogs with many being lactose intolerant, If you want to go that route then plain yogurt as a treat occasionally is fine, Other treats can be plain meat as your cat is a carnivore. cheese if your cat can tolerate it is ok too once in a  while.   Canned foods no gravy are much healthier for your cats then any dry foods   Best of luck|`|YBcB0732aa	Cat should only drink water. No milk or soymilk, there are special cat milk that's okay.    Cat are lactose intolerant it makes that get gas,diarrhea...|`|yCR6qg0baa	Why are you feeding your cat soy milk? She doesn't need it. Leave out plenty of fresh water (that's the ONLY thing cats should drink). Peas & corn lack fats, proteins, and amino acids. If she liked them, just mix them in with a healthy cat food like Purina One.     Chocolate, raisins, grapes, milk, most dairy, canned tuna, raw seafood, raw meat, onions, and garlic are BAD for cats to consume. The side effects range from diarrhea to death by kidney failure.     Just feed your cat normal cat food. Give her a can of wet food as a treat occasionally. I give my cat wet food every time I go to the grocery store (once a week).|`|4UQegWk0aa	Never EVER give a cat milk - they are lactose intolerant. I don't know about soya milk but surely it's best just to stick with the cat milk? It has been specially formulated for cats so its safer.|`|gtfiTodHaa	if your going to give her milk i would buy proper cat milk which available from supermarkets and pet stores|`|S7uh7eG6aa	No, No, No. Soy milk is vegetable. Cats can't digest it at all. If you must give her milk, buy one from a pet shop formulated especially for cats - Cimicat is the best.  I bet she won't drink soymilk anyway, cats aren't stupid|`|9pO3XVxMaa	ASK YOUR VETERINARIAN!!|`|sb9N7KR4aa	This might sound a little weird, and your cat might not like it but it's worth a try. It is used to keep his/her hair very healthy. Mix an egg yolk into her dry cat food.  By the way, I think a small amount of soy milk would be best. Maybe work your way up to more soy milk or give him/her small amounts three times a day.

I am never entirely certain but I keep my horses in a farming area and have been told multiple times that the grass will not grow until the air temperature hits a consistent 13 degrees.  However I have also heard that certain types of grass can grow at lower temperatures and that there is such a thing as grass temperature which is measured at about 2 inches above ground level (whereas air temperature is taken at around 6 ft or so), and is generally lower than air temperature - which may explain why the farmers etc say 13 degrees and certain websites state 5 or 6 degrees.  I do tend to stick by the farmers' advice on most things concerning pasture and stock management though - they have more at stake than I do and masses more experience in that field ( ouch!)  February is apparently the best time to spread muck etc onto the fields as it gets a chance to soak in before the temperatures rise and the new growth starts.|`|JLOz9rXNaa	its a little early but posible|`|4Xa3optLaa	I've been told (can't remember who by) that it needs to be 8 degrees C before 'normal' pasture grass ie ryegrass will grow.  It would seem unlikely that grass is growing anywhere in the UK yet.  If you feed hay in the field, your ponies will tell you when the grass is coming through because they'll ignore the hay to graze.  Even if they don't get anything extra in the field, you'll probably notice them grazing more once the grass starts (I'm in Scotland and it's usually not until April).

Here is a great alternative solution!    Go to the store and get some plain, low-fat (or nonfat) yogurt. I usually go to Wal-Mart or the nearest grocery store and buy the biggest tub I can find (which is only $3 bucks).    Put a treat in the hole at the bottom and get small spoon and spoon in the yogurt. You can add layers or treats or I always put a milkbone in the middle (that way its stuck and they really have to work to get it out) and then fill the yogurt up to the top.    Put this in your freezer for about 2 hours and take it out. This makes a nice tasty Frozen Yogurt Treat. The plain yogurt will not upset their stomach, and the live cultures and probiotics is great! Also, since it is frozen, it won't make them thirsty. All my rescues and my personal dogs love this. It keeps the average-high energy dogs (I have 5 border collies) busy for a good 2.5-3 hours. For the ones who are newbies to the Kong, it will take a little longer.    During the summer I put in chicken broth or beef stock in the Kong's and freeze them for a nice cool treat!    **This usually does not make a mess. If you are worried, try putting an old towel or blanket down (assuming she is not crated).|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	The better question is what don't I put into my dogs kongs.     Yesterday I shoved chuncks of pork in them, the day before that they got ground chicken, a gizzard and sardines.     I even shoved a pig ear in the kongs once.     If it fits in the Kong and isn't toxic to dogs, its fair game for Kong stuffing here.|`|gtfiTodHaa	you can get that paste stuff which is made by kong available in most pet stores, this keeps my puppy amused for hours she loves it! it comes in loads of different flavours|`|sW8eg01saa	they make things to put in the kongs that worked for my dogs but only for a little while but you could try cheese whiz and it is safe because the vet from my home town used it when she gave my dog her shots but thats all i would tell you to put in it. good luck on finding something|`|ZZfyRPRdaa	I don't like the idea of filling the kong with peanut butter. The idea is to put a bit of it around the lip of the kong for taste. PB is so fattening (for dogs and humans) - we wouldn't eat it by the spoonful so why should our dogs.    I tried a few things, the favourites being:  - mixed up mince, vegies & rice (even oats).  - mashed banana, cooked oats and honey.    And of course frozen lasts longer.

763d8998cc522365a310364733b360e7aa	If you want to invest the time and effort into this there are a few things that might help.  <br>  <br>  1) Take and dig a shallow trench all along the length of your fence around the entire yard, gates included.<br>  2) Take chicken wire, it might be expensive but the best kind might be the rubber coated metal kind meant for garden borders (it should last longer that way), bury the chicken wire laying flat in the shallow trench.  Theoretically most dogs stop digging when they reach something like this because it doesn't feel comfortable to their paws.  If your doggie is really determined though I can't guarantee it'll stop her.  But it does seem to work for our 5.  Of the 5, 3 are diggers.  Whenever they dig in the main part of the yard away from our "booby traps", we do this:<br>  <br>  3) Take a couple of bricks (best kind are the flat ones meant for paving walkways--you can usually get broken cast off ones pretty cheap at most home/garden places) and bury them in the hole they've created.  They hit them and learn to avoid that spot after a bit.  Then we can usually dig up (when they're not watching of course) the brick and they don't seem to bother with that spot any more.<br>  <br>  The trick is to make any no-no area as unappealing to them as possible.  Scolding or telling them no just doesn't seem to work, they don't understand why they can't dig there.  But if it's not comfortable for their paws they'll learn quickly enough to leave it alone.  <br>  <br>  Things to watch out for though is to keep an eye on the state of the fence area for any pieces of the chicken wire sticking out that have been pulled up or had fallen apart as the exposed wire could pose a puncture/scratch hazard.  Same thing goes for the brick thing, if you've noticed your dog has dug in a spot you've put a brick take a sec and inspect her paws just to make sure she hasn't broken a nail or scraped her pads on it.  <br>  <br>  Chances are like I said right off once she hits the hard surface (usually with just the tips of the nails before they get too far), or the chicken wire they'll stop right away.  They'll give it a go in another spot and might even check out the first spots a few times "just to make sure" but they'll soon realize it's just no fun digging in those areas.<br>  <br>  4) Another thing that has helped is that we do give them one spot in the yard that is a safe ok place for them to dig.  They've dug down depressions in the ground and use them to lounge in while we're working/playing in the yard.  The interesting thing is other than occasional "housekeeping" of their digging spot they don't dig very much more at all.  <br>  <br>  You might encourage something like this after doggie proofing the fence area by providing a spot she is allowed to dig at and encouraging/praising her when she digs there.  Get her started by digging it up a bit yourself with a shovel to provide that oh so tempting soft fresh dirt to play in.  ;-)  Good luck!  Hope this helps.|`|92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	We've had our pit bull for 2 years, and he digs massive craters in our backyard lol. We still have yet to fix his problem also. We've tried the poop thing like you've said. It works for a little bit, but he just goes to another area. Our dog has never tried to dig out though, he'll dig kind of next to our fence but he'll always be 1 foot away, he never tries to dig near it. But that could just be our dog. I did want to add though that if you don't ever get the problem fixed to watch his feet from the digging, our dog had problems from getting things stuck in his feet from it and we never knew it until he started limping a lot.|`|aeb0640d39dd49abbd290a8327ac3299aa	if you have another dog you might want ot put them together because sometimes a dog will dig holes because they are lonely or they are just bored.|`|752a13f31b30980f81bc24cb2595c6ddaa	well i had a huskey shepered mix and she loved to dig holes and i think that the reason is because theres something that she smells underground, or because shell be diggin around trying to get some other animal nearby or cuz of the dog she is huskys love to dig holes so its nothing to be worried about just make sure the holes dont get real deep|`|AA11783671	It's already been mentioned, but the chicken wire thing works.  Run it along the edge of your fence if your afraid of digging out for sure, but then also her favorite spots.  I didn't trench it though, I just laid it over the grass and had some wire stakes that you pushed through the ground.  When the dog tries to dig, it hurts their nails enough that they decide they don't want to dig there.  It doesn't physically harm them though---like cruelty or anything.  I imagine it to be like us grating our nails across the chalkboard or something.

If you get one from a rescue its obviously not going ot cost nearly anything.

They are affectionate, trainable, and if you look deeply into their eyes you can see a loving little buddy. Rats live for only two to three, and with good breeding, sometimes four years. These buddies are prone to different diseases, so you want to keep them somewhere that they won't get cold in the winter. I reccomend putting a kitty heater under the cage.     They need a guinea pig sized cage and toys to play with. Playtime isn't hard because whenever you enter a room, they rush up to the cage bars and beg. And then, theres no resisting. You have to pick them up.     But if you say that your dog had a kitty friend in the last home, put them tigether. I'll think they'll be friends just supervise them when they're together. A rat isn't scared of anything. Hope you enjoy your new rodent friend :)|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	A rat. They almost act like small puppies!

KeevlZnTaa	What you feed will depend on the age of your rabbit. Young rabbits(under a year), have a different diet than adults.    Under seven month, they need alfalfa hay, and pellets, with veggies introduced one at a time. Since you already introduced carrots, do not give the rabbit another veggie for at least a few days. If the rabbit is young, then giving too many different veggies can cause diarrhea and stomach upset(by introducing one at a time you will know which veg can caused the problem and then avoid giving the rabbit this veg). Pellets are the most important to young rabbits, as they have a lot of nutrients. You should also have hay available at all times, rabbits need to have access to hay 24/7, to prevent hairballs and blockages.     Baby rabbits should be fed unlimited pellets up to the age of seven months. Give him all the pellets that he will eat in the day.    Rabbits that are seven months to one year old should be eating 1/2 cup per 6 lbs of body weight, and the amount of veggies fed per day should be gradually increased.    After one year they need mostly veggies(mine gets two cups of assorted veggies, half cup pellets and timothy hay),no more alfalfa past one year. Too many pellets will cause your rabbit to get fat, and a fat rabbit will have health issues. In order to get the proper nutrition, you need to feed at least 3-5 different veggies per day, and make sure they are different colors(as different colors means different nutrients). Hay still needs to be available 24/7.    Adult rabbits(1 year +), need 1/4 - 1/2 cup of pellets per 6lbs of body weight, and 2 cups of vegetables per 6lbs of weight.    Rabbits produce 2 types of feces, the harder pelleted feces normally found in a rabbit cage, and the soft, greenish, mucous covered feces. These softer feces are actually called cecotropes. The cecotropes usually won't be found in the cage, as the rabbit normally eats these as they are produced. As gross as it sounds, cecotropes are quite nutritious being high in some vitamins, etc. In fact, the production of cecotropes is a very important and significant part of the digestive sytem function of rabbits.    Rabbits will eat their feces at night, so you can still clean the cage and remove the feces in the morning.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	about 85% of diet timothy hay (not alfalfa it is sugar to them)-  this should always be available to the rabbit    10% Rabbit pellets- A cup in the morning and a cup in the evening    4% Veggies( got to www.rabbit.org to get a list of the kinds rabbits can eat)- just a small handful a day    1%-treats (I suggest papaya tablets, bunnies love them and they clean out their intestines to prevent GI stasis, a problem rabbits get when they have a hairball in their intestines)    If you have more questions this website is the most factual website on rabbits out there:    www.rabbit.com|`|CZIQMIr0aa	No you should clean your rabbits cage at least every 2 days!

In fact, rabbits will east most anything that is fresh and green.  Try not to give it old wilted stuff.  Grass, dandelion leaves and flowers, clover etc, but make sure it picked fresh on the day, and fed to him. Avoid pulling it from roadsides as it might have been sprayed with herbicides.  As long as he is clearing up his food in one go - you are not over-feeding him. If he leaves any, you ARE overfeeding him. Don`t leave the food he doesn`t eat in his hutch either. They haven`t much room, so  it will become contaminated with his own urine.|`|8qKqnl72aa	Okay, I could give you a list right now that would take ages to read, but i won't.

Email me if you have any other rabbit questions!    -Abbey|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	A rabbits diet should consist of the following (in this order)    Hay  Veggies  Dry food    All rabbits need unlimited access to grass hay (eg timothy hay). (This is the closest they will get to a natural diet) Hay is vital for proper digestion (preventing gut stasis), wearing down teeth and preventing boredmo. Your rabbit should eat more hay than anything else, which is why it must always be available, so the rabbit can eat as much as he likes, whenever he likes.    Rabbits should also get a variety of fresh veggies and leafy greens daily. Your rabbit needs around 5 different types of veggies / greens per day - one or two handfuls in total. There is a list of what rabbits can and can't eat on the link I've given you.    Dry food - if your rabbit is "selective feeding" (only eating the nice bits and leaving others) then you shuold try switching to pellets to ensure a balanced diet.  Rabbits under 6 months can be given unlimited pellets, but older rabbits should be given a limited amount as a daily meal. If your rabbit is leaving pellets, or is overweight, then reduce the amount you give him.    Bear in mind that your rabbit is probably not used to getting a proper diet (many pet stores and breeders don't bother!), so you will need to make any changes to his diet very gradually so a not to upset his tummy.    Check out: http://www.rabbitwelfare.co.uk/resources...    Rabbits do practice coprophagia (poo eating) but you may not ever notice. This is because they do not eat the little round poos they leave over their cage. They only eat caecotrophs - special poos that they eat directly from their anus. This is perfectly normal so don't worry.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	your walmart and pet stores has rabbit food for your pet thats the best thing to feed your rabbit look online for advice on rabbit care and how much to feed your pets or go to the library|`|a8f515200862ad34c4fe6b422c7fd708aa	simple and suggestive:  rabbit food.    animals are animals.  they eat how much and when they want.  don't worry about it.  you can't govern their eating habits.    you'll find that a rabbit is one of the messiest, nastiest, smelly animals you could have chosen.|`|8sYPIgUraa	You need to go to your local pet store and get some rabbit pellets. they need food all the time. put a bowl of the pellets in the cage for the rabbit. you should also have a cage where their droppings go through the bottom on a tray you can slide out and clean.

They are not messy and smelly, like another poster answered.    I would suggest you check out rabbit.org  That is the best website for rabbit care info.    If you have an adult rabbit, he should have an unlimited supply of timothy hay available at all times.      He should also eat a salad of leafy greens (but NO ICEBERG LETTUCE, very limited spinach and kale), about two cups per 5 pounds of body weight every day.    Pellets should be fed sparingly because they can lead to weight problems.  You should feed timothy-based pellets (harder to find and more expensive, but much better for your bun), about 1/4 cup a day for a 5 lb rabbit.    If he is a baby, he will need a different diet, including alfalfa hay and pellets, and no vegetables.  I believe the hay and pellets should be fed free choice, but rabbit.org would have more info.    New vegetables should be introduced slowly, and one at a time.  Cabbage has been known to cause gas, so I don't feed it, but it's not poisonous or anything.  I personally wouldn't feed it, but I know a lot of buns really like it.  Radish tops are ok to feed too.  There is a list of suggested veggies at:  http://rabbit.org/care/veggies.html    Carrots are considered a treat, because they contain a lot of sugar.  I only give my rabbit a 1/2" slice every few days, but I think you could feed a small slice every day.    Rabbits have two different types of poops...cecotrophs and fecal pellets.  The fecal pellets are the cocoa-puff like things you'll find around the cage.  Rabbits normally don't eat them.  Cecotrophs look like mulberries, they're clusters of soft material that the rabbits eat directly from their rectum.  If you find these clusters around your rabbit's cage, it could mean that his diet is too rich in protein, or it could signify a larger problem.    So, no, you don't have to leave normal fecal pellets around the cage.    If you litter train your rabbit, it will make cleaning his cage MUCH easier and faster.  Here's a great site on the subject.  http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.ht...    Good luck with your bun, and you should read as much as you can on rabbit.org
f8t4FQZ5aa	Do not have any natural wood surfaces in the enclosure (other than removable items that can be disinfected) In addition to the fact that you will never be able to properly disinfect the enclosure itself with a wood base or sides, prey such as crickets, roaches, locust etc. will be able to climb up it and be out of reach of your dragon. Your best bet at  is to line it with melamine and caulk all corners and seams and you will be fine. If you are sealing the walls with rock this should also be ok but I would still recomend a melamine base and top, it will be simple to keep clean and virtually maintenance free. Also SAND IF FINE FOR DRAGONS! (the previous advice regarding substrate is COMPLETELY INCORRECT) Good luck      Edit:As I apparently don't know what I'm talking about I will explained further to those that are obviously S... L.... O... W.  Yes many enclosures have been made out of wood...in fact some of OURS are made out of wood (with melamine covering). Using wood is not the BEST option EVEN IF IT IS SEALED as dragons DO have sharp claws and DO like to dig! Repetitive digging is likely to damage and peel off any sealant, thus not only allowing any moisture to penetrate the wood and creating an ideal home for bacteria but also presenting the problem that the dragon may ingest bits of the peeled sealant which has the potential to be toxic! As to the sand....Impactions due to sand (not calci or altered sands) are rare. There are MANY reputable and well know breeders who raise even young dragons on this substrate! (We use paper towel for our hatchlings and juveniles till apox 8-10")  Sand is far less hazardous than some of the advice you will see on here!!! (see below) and people have used wood cages without problems but the question is do you want it done right or do you want to save a few bucks and have a half-a$$ed enclosure (much like some peoples advice).|`|QZ3eucYWaa	I would go check out the information at the link below. It is a discussion forum on DIY projects mainly discussing habitat building. I do not know the answer to your question directly, but I do know that you can find it here be it by the question already being addressed, or you can ask yourself and I am sure you will get the answers you need.    http://www.beardeddragon.org/bjive/viewf...    I would consider not using loose substrate at all. Just the slightest bit can cause major problems.  Good luck with your building =)|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|uvQG3e15aa	Have you sealed the wood yet? I would recommend sealing it with some more coats and airing it out completely. Best may be adding a fan and some lights on it to to make sure everything is aired out properly. Get an outdoor sealer, that is UVB protected. Which means that the uvb that you use will not ruin the sealant.    The person above doesnt seem to know what he's talking about.  Of course sand is a hazard... Has chances to cause impaction... A chance many are not willing to take and MANY enclosures have been made out of wood. All without problems.     If you are going to use sand, go with a fine childrens play sand, sift it to get all large pieces out, and wash it to get rid of the dust. Make sure that your basking temps are just correct 105-115 for babies so that if he DOES swallow some sand it has a better chance of passing.     But If you have a baby I would reccomend using tile for now, until he is an adolescent or juvi. This lessens the chance of impaction.     Oh and dont forget to seal the styrofoam rocks =)
3mks78Fgaa	i cannot say FOR SUre whether or not your cat has worms, however, my experiance with a "wormy" cat was that her stomach became distended as the worms progressed, and she actually looked as tho she were gaining weight.. my advice =is to take a fecal sample to the vet and let him or her examine  your cat. i, myself am on a fixed income, but it was well worth it for me.  my cat is alive, well, and worm free!. i do not advise getting an "all purpose" wormer" from a pet store. they DO miss some types of parasites. please, whatever you do, let us here know how your cat is doing after you have him or her checked.|`|gqf1WT0Faa	well usually if a cat has worms it will show in their fecal matter. i would take your cat to the vet just to be sure,they can get cancer too. so you never know what can be wrong without a vet to check the problem.    hope kitty gets better soon.|`|NaMvJKsuaa	If you do not give it anti parasite pill it is a good idea to give it after the age of 5 months according to its weight.Consult a vet if it gets thinner|`|e71MWgJJaa	if the cat has worms he might be getting thinner but for dogs they like puke blood. go to the vet to find out if the cat does they give him medicine and it kills the worms right away.|`|j2yHX3mOaa	Sounds like it|`|08a714d3e35f7a5fcf99d16c6a42a486aa	Look at his butt. When my cat had worms you could see them all around his butthole. You can also check his litter, mine had little white worms that looked almost like living rice grains. I got a bottle of Fish tape powder online, mixed it with cream cheese so the kitty would lick it off his paw and killed them all.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	You do not say how old your cat is.  If you are talking about a kitten then you should definitely worm him as most kittens are born with worms.  Don't get anything over the counter - you need a professional broad spectrum wormer such as Panacur or something your vet recommends.  Read the instructions carefully as the amount of wormer to give depends upon the weight of the kitten/cat.    If you are talking about an adult cat then you should take your cat to a vet for blood tests.  Weight loss can be the symptoms of many diseases such as kidney failure, diabetes or hyperthyroid - the last 2 are particularly relevant if your cat is calling for more food whereas with kidney failure most cats would lose their appetite.  A simple blood test will reveal the problem and then you can start helping your cat to get better.  I have one cat with diabetes and one with hyperthyroid so don't worry too much, you can get this sorted but you need professional help.
ak9DrBSwaa	I'm guessing you're the babysitter and not the parent? If so, call the parents and let them decide on the best course of action.    I'm also going to assume the child was actually being watched by someone and only a very small amount was injested before an adult could get to him and we didn't allow an unwatched baby to clean the rabbit cage in such a manner?    If so, and its a piece or two of each and both the rabbits and baby are otherwise healthy probably nothing will happen, but the parents will want to contact their pediatrician just in case.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	The rabbit dung may have intestinal parasites that could kill the child.|`|hQNmgdQ7aa	Ewwwwwwwwww.

Either on the counter, in the trash, in your purse, whatever. Dogs are curious animals and will get into anything they are allowed.    My purse never goes on the floor (had a phone a checkbook get ruined that way when they were puppies). The trash can has a solid lid on it, even though they were tought not to mess with it. And they are always crated when we are not home, for our furnitures sake.|`|nl5JOu43aa	I actually get on my hands and knees looking for things my yorkies can get hold off,just when I think everything is out of their reach,they find something I missed.just this morning my female found a nail and I have no idea where it came from.|`|PMksnqkxaa	I try very hard to keep things out of my dogs reach until i learned one of them could jump high and get on counters, open the fridge and open cabinets. I thought i was just being irresponsible and leaving things out until i caught my dog (tila) in the act. She is a great dog except for being to smart for a dog. I now have locks on all my cabinets and fridge even though it's a pain in the behind.     So are you saying your dog NEVER got something of yours?   Most people don't intentionally give their dogs something harmful or something that may be harmful.. I do however agree that people need to be more responsible with there stuff.
px27V5N9aa	For $2000 you can buy a colt/filly from the stallion breeder that you like!  Your mare must be worth something else if you are going to breed her for THAT!  Especially in this crappy horse market.  Whew!!!    Anyhow...to catch her in her heat the best way is to have her at the vet and they tease her there and ultrasound the follicles.  Here is some info I have been looking up since I, too will be breeding my mare next spring.   But I KNOW when she's in heat.  That tail of hers is up and she's winkin' at my husband!   (has me worried! ahha)    ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION:  http://www.greenacres-stud.com/ai.htm    this one has great info on the heat:  http://www.theperuvianpaso.com/_mares___...|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	"In my opinion"  If your mare is anything like mine the only real way is to have a stag around, a male that thinks he is a stallion, but don't have anything in the bank.    She varies so much through out the year, that the calender is practically useless.    Don't so much worry about what discipline the stallion has been participating and look for conformation, temperament and health history. Then it is easier to get a cheaper stud fees and usually get a better foal.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	For $2000, you can purchase a well bred prospect, possibly out of a stallion that you have chosen and be much closer to your goal...maybe even started and ready to finish.  I, personally would consider that route.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	How  can you miss it?? If you don't when she is in you may need to educate yourself on breeding. You are willing to breed her to any stud???  You should research the stallions that are in your price range. Look for better conformation then your mare. Do you know that USA send 90,000 horses to slaughter every year. That is NO LIE!!!!  Look into the stud you want because there are sooo many unwanted horses. It is soooooooo much cheaper to buy  a foal. Then you would be saving a horse slaughter as well!!! Then you can pick what color you like. Breeding is not always the best thing to do.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Assuming you are in the US and its winter, mares are not yet on  normal heat cycles (unless under lights).  In March or even April, she should start showing.  You can tell one way when she urinates, the urine will be "creamy yellow" in color and thicker than urine.  You can use a gelding to see if she is in, if she is, she will show to a gelding. You said you are breeding her NEXT year?  In 2010, or you mean this spring? Either way, winter time its hard to get a schedule figured, as they will not be in a normal breeding cycle. All you can do at this point is watch when she urinates, or starts having "mood changes".  She may even show to other mares on occasion.  As for the stallion, you want to buy one for $2K or find a fee under 2k?    ~*~*~*~*~ Here is some  stallion sites http://www.horsesonly.com/finder/qh-alph...  http://linksmanager.com/thinkhorses/link...  http://www.buyhorsesonly.com/search_resu...|`|XsBIITFvaa	I know when my mare's in season because firstly, my colt is proud cut, meaning he can get it on....but no babies....lol. Breeders would love to have my gelding becasue he's the best darn-tooten screamer I ever did see. (a screamer is a gelding that a lot of breeders use to tell when a mare is in season. they litterly scream. what the first guy called a stag.) He'll let you know when every mare in the neighbor goes into season!! Hell, I swear he screams when I'm on my cycle!!     But you may not have a screamer around, so watch her when she's in the pasture. If she acts like she's gotta pee, but only a little juice comes out, she's in season. She may also be moody. If my colt gets within 5 feet of my mare, she grunts, pins her ears, and turns her butt towards him. So....watch for the weird peeing thing. Her "juice" will me more thick than pee, and a lot less yellow.|`|IAiZTdIhaa	You should watch for any differences in her behavior such as extreme moodiness. Also, if you keep her in a stall watch for what she..'produces.' If it looks like blood then she's in heat. You could also check on her often and watch closely when she walks by any male horses. I know of some horse finding websites where you can find studs on:    www.equinehits.com  www.horsetopia.com  www.horseville.com
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	You can take her to a vet and have them palpate her, if her litter is small you may not feel them. The nipples can be pinker for many reasons. Skin color, hormones. Have the vet shave her belly and look for a spay scar. Otherwise you will know in a few months. If she is fresh pregnant you have about 2 and 1/2 and if she is farther along she will begin to fill out and act differently. Just depends how many kittens are in there.|`|BmI2fszPaa	I adopted a cat that had had kittens in the past, and her nipples are pink, and larger than other cats. You can feel them if you stroke her tummy.   If you can't tell that she's pregnant, how would the previous owners know?  Maybe she just has larger nipples!
395196f427a3bfd5aca87f8298bfa682aa	In all my years of dealing with hamsters I've always used dish soap and water. Or I've used Clorox anywhere hard surface daily sanitizing spray, they say you can use it right around kids so I figured it would be good for the cages too.That works too you just have to let it air out a little before putting the hammie back.  But with dish soap I've found that the original dawn dish soap scrubs the best.  Hope I helped.|`|a08c52d63ce9f1a954dbe165d3bb5863aa	I would use either Dish soap and water, OR to get rid of even more germs...use 409 All Purpose Cleaner.

ltP1gO4taa	You should be able to get one for nothing to very little money.  The Labrador Retriever is the most popular dog in the US and one of the most popular dogs in the world.  There are hundreds of Lab rescue organizations with both puppies and full grown dogs available for adoption.|`|Um8osMNuaa	You should check out shelters, lots of people get Labs without realising how much time and attention they need and then dump them at the shelter.  lf getting from a breeder, make sure they are a reputable breeder and not a BYB or you may end up with lots of health problems.    l paid 350 for my yellow Lab when she was 8 weeks old.  My chocolate Lab Milly was 500, l also got her at 8 weeks old.    ln the UK, black Labs tend to be be the cheaper of the three colours, then yellow, and the chocolate ones are the dearest. Not as many chocolate Labs around so they are the highest in price.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Considering labs are probably the  1 victim of backyard breeders & as a result are loaded with health problems, (Mostly ortho problems, bad hips, bad kness, bad elbows) You will do yourself a facour by buying from a licenced, registered breeder who does health clearances on all their breeding dogs. You can get a BYSer Lab for $200 but once the health issues come up, it will end up costing you alot more $ in vet bills & heartache. A proper breeder varies but somewhere in the $ 600 range is average. many labs from ByBers have been mixed here & there & no regard to temperment & conformation & are shadows of what a real well bred Lab should be.|`|DJ9jj9A0aa	we got ours w/ a $600 down payment, with some after that.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Go to Petsmart and get him a Kong toy to chew on, they're the ones with the hollow inside to put a treat in.  It take the dog a while to manage to get the treat out.      Dogs like lab's get bored easily, you've got to keep them busy, even if you're not home.  I've got a lab mix, and the Kong we got him seems to be keeping his attention (meaning less time for him to chew on our fence and anything else he can carry).    Also, you don't necessarily have to buy the treats that go with the Kong, I just use treats my dog likes and a dab of peanut butter to hold them in place if they don't fit.|`|ltP1gO4taa	Chewing is usually a sign of frustration.  A large dog like a lab needs to be walked twice a day for 45 mins to an hour each time.      You should never leave an EF collar on for more than 10 hours at a time.  The posts dig into the skin and can cause irritation.  He may be chewing them off because it hurts.    They also make a better collar for stimulation collars to replace the one it comes with.  http://leerburg.com/1150.htm|`|snUDfcfgaa	Ah.  He's just being a labby.  People will tell you that they are bored or frustrated, but I have a lab that is entertained almost constantly and she still chews things.  Could you rub something nasty on it so that when he bit it he would stop?  Maybe like a jalapeno pepper or something.  That's what I had to do to my chair legs when my dog was younger.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Just have him outside when you are out there to supervise.  Often times electric fences are a waste of money and time.  Tire this dog out.  Take him running in the morning, to a dog park if you have one in the afternoons, and run him again in the evening. Or just romp around the yard with him in the evenings and tire his butt out.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	You need a breeding net ideally, if you have a very fine fish net that can make do for now, as long as they're still in the healthy flow of the tank.    Ideally females SHOULDN'T be put in breeding boxes to give birth - it can cause birth complications, aborted fry or even death of the mother through stress. Dense plants like java moss should be provided for the fry to hide in and if you can catch them then THEY can be put into a breeding net.|`|tDZMJue9aa	use the  net for your aquarium...until you can get a breeders net|`|c46BrSe7aa	You can either get a breeding net to float them at the top of the tank or what i would do is let the mom eat some of them so that you don't have like 30 more guppies.

Keep her fed and she won't eat as many.  Are there any other fish in the tank?  if it's just her, why don't you just move her into something else for a couple of weeks till they get too big for her to eat.  She'll most likely have fry every 30 days for several months and you're going to have millions and won't know what to do with them.  That many fry will cause an ammonia spike so you're going to have to keep checking for that, and don't forget, they don't stay tiny forever   Do you have room for that many grown fish? It only takes a few months  and they'll be reproducing themselves.  your water quality will go down quickly so you're going to have to keep on top of it.  I doubt that she'll eat them all anyway.  Put a plastic  plant in the tank for them to hide in.if you don't have another tank to move them to.

m16gf9mzaa	Strangers on the internet cannot accurately answer this question.  You will have to ask those neighbors if their cats are Manx cats.  Manx is a breed of cat, with the possible characteristic of having no tail. Here is a webpage that tells more about it:  http://www.fanciers.com/breed-faqs/manx-... The Manx tailless gene is a dominant trait, so all kittens born to a cat with that particular tailless gene will have no tail. It is still possible that the kitten could get the gene from a different father than the rest of the kittens, but even if so, it would only be part Manx. It is also possible that these cats are just Domestic Short Hair cats, no special breed, and that kitten just happens to have a spontaneous mutation.  I would guess this is the more likely possibility.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes a local Manx tom could have fathered it without necessarily fathering the others. Have a look around and see if you can spot him.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Its possible. Cats can also have multiple mates so it could have a different father than the others.     We just had a litter of puppies born at our rescue. 2 with tails, 2 with stubs and 2 with no tail at all. Its pretty cute.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	It sounds like a Manx cat.  The other think about them is they have big back ends and sometimes they run strangely|`|DapNp1Kxaa	A litter of four kittens can have four different fathers. It's possible that your friends have a sneaky manx cat around their house. It's also possible for it to be a recessive gene. If it's a manx, and not just an oddity, as it grows older, it's back legs will get longer, and its' butt will be higher than its' shoulders. That's a sure trait of a manx. They are great pets, really responsive, and playful, kind of like a dog.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Usually the hind legs appear too long, if it is a manx.  The general size of the kitten wouldn't be abnormal but his walking sorta looks like a hop. There is a spinal irregularity that contributes to the taillessness.  You won't be able to make that determination by sight only.  If your neighbor deems it as an odd cat, I am sure that they will seek a vet.  A Manx is a hunter extraordinaire and can take down possums and the larger rodent class.  If it is, a farmer would love to have him.|`|387f6c8511dc708488cdb19cf6a783daaa	How bizarre! But what is your question?  Edit: The Manx cat is a breed of cat not just a cat without a tail.|`|AA10223160	see vet|`|tX57rwksaa	What you have written is a statement, not a question..   Is the question:> do you think that this is a Manx cat offspring|`|JLOz9rXNaa	mabye|`|VNC6UieFaa	Smiler i volonteer with Cat Rescue i love cats lol.... it could be possible that during the birth the mother bit it off this has happened a few times before.. it happpens accidently when they are just born and the mum ist cleaning all the mess and aftebirth off them etc she has bitten it off, if so it wouldnt hurt a kitten as she done it wen just born the bloodsupply will stop immediatley.................donmt worry this is ok lol  hope that helps   leanne xx|`|LofOjmeMaa	i was born with no tail but am not  mancs ,as i stay in glasgow lmao|`|BY0cV4kRaa	It probably a Manx cat|`|qH7BJjTsaa	i think it's manx cat|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Its not uncommon for one kitten in a litter to be larger than the others, so I wouldn't necessarily attribute that to the manx gene.    Also, not all kittens in a litter necessarily have the same father. If momma cat is allowed access to the outdoors, you could be looking at two or more daddies.    Some info on Manx Cats    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_(cat)
GJCUCVSMaa	I had the exact same problem except I had a kitten and an older smaller dog (toy fox terrier). My cat HATED the dog and would attack him even if the dog was not anywhere near her. Eventually I gave up trying to keep them away from each other and one day I came home and my cat was jumping on my dogs back playfully. I cant give you a specific amount of time but I would probably say in the months range. I would keep a close eye on them when they are interacting because your cat still has its claws but I wouldnt intervene.    GOOD LUCK!|`|aZi6BvBraa	What do you mean by 'it still has it claws'? I hope you are not concidering to get them removed???    When you adopted the cat, did you check if the cat was used to dogs?  Does the cat approach the dog to slap her, or does the dog approach the cat?  Make sure the cat always has a place where she can go where the dog cant reach her, so they have the space to avoid eachother. Also, get the cat a bell around her neck so the dog knows where the cat is.    I would give it two weeks, if the cat is not used to dogs she might never get used to them as she is already 4 yrs old. If it doesnt work out an older dog might be a better friend for your dog.   Keep in mind though... it is in an animals nature to reject animals that are not 'normal'. Your dog being blind might be a reason for other animals not to accept her. Therefore, if you would consider a dog, you might want to get an older, calmer and not dominant dog.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...put them both under the covers of the bed and "tuck in" the open end...   it won't long !   "they will be bed-buddys in no time at all !|`|ltP1gO4taa	Unfortunately, I think that a kitten might have been a better choice.  This grown cat may not like dogs.  A kitten wouldn't know any better.  You might look into getting the cat declawed.  At least that way the slaps wouldn't be painful to the dog.    My anecdotal experience:  I had a cat and got a dog.  That cat just tolerates the dog.  I got a kitten after we already had the dog and the kitten thinks the dog is her mother, she sleeps with the dog and follows the dog everywhere.
Wo0AWgYVaa	I have a giant breed too.  Walking is ok...but it's the cement that you need to watch out.  Walk your dog on grass for the first 3 to 4 mths, then you can have a bit cement .....but ideally for the first year, let it to exercise on grass more and less impact on the joint    Every dog is different in exercise need.  My dog is 7 mths now, he needs about 2 hours a day to be calm dog but his another littermate needs at least 3 hours.  Your dog will tell you in his own way, trust me.  Some general guideline, is add 5 mins to every month on each walk...but the truth is if I follow that guideline, I will have a very hyper puppy.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You can take your pup out after he's had his 9 wk shots.  Make the walks about 10 minutes each and he can go out multiple times a day.  If you think he's to cold (less than 25 degrees outside) then take him out long enough to potty, then go back in.  I walk our 2 Labs in 30 degree weather for half an hour.  No problems at all. :)|`|YoLa0aE8aa	Oh my uncle has A german sheppard and a Great Dane and i think he started walking them routinely at 1 and half years of age.|`|2w21Xfp1aa	well you dont want to freeze the puppy but you can go on short walks now.the sooner the better,this will get him housed trained faster,go out about ten times a day.he would rather go pee and poo out side|`|AA10998195	When it can walk, start out slow down the street and back, then around the block etc. At 2 months it should be able to walk down the street and back - getting use to the leash and all.|`|BPMCKbyRaa	You definately should NOT take your pup for jogs at 1 year.  Danes mature very slow, and you can do damage to him if you push him too soon.      Short, gentle walks are ok, and are good for him.  Every pup needs a little exercise, and it will help tire him out so he doesn't destroy the house.  If it's cold, get him a little coat - danes don't have much body fat, and a thin coat so he'll get cold quickly.     Long, or strenuous exercise should not happen before 2 years old.|`|FdcWPp48aa	You can immediately start getting your pup used to walking on leash, however, you will need to keep it away from other dogs and areas that other dogs have been until he is fully immunized.  Training cannot start too early.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Your pup can go for walks as soon as he is old enough for his new home. Just keep him away from dog parks or other dogs until he has all his shots. make sure he doesn't eat any feces. The more thigns you expose him to as a youngster the better, walk around the block, walk him to the forest, lots of new smells. Short more frequent walks are better than any long ones. Be VERY aware of bloat, the  1 killer of Danes.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Gestation for Guppies is anything from 21-28 days or so depending on the tank environment, if it's a healthy tank, the fish are on a good diet and, most importantly, it's warm (at least 76F-80F) then it will be quicker than if the fish is in cool water, in a poor tank environment with a rubbish diet.|`|AraBfesHaa	The female guppy stores the sperm and releases more fry when the conditions are right, about once a month for about 6 months.  They can have up to 80+ at a time.  Hope you have alot of room or alot of tanks.  you're going to need it!  In a few months the fry will start reproducing too.|`|c46BrSe7aa	about 28 days. but it could be before or after that.|`|87343be75e44dc74890d44363386817baa	Hi About 21 to 28 days|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	it depends a lot on temperature,the warmer the sooner [not by a long time though]its usually a cycle of 28 days.Do you know that the female can give birth 4 or 5 times without going with a male after the first time as a lot of livebearers excepting the goodea family.       regards
ygIBIBsYaa	Depending on how big the first batch are they will pretty much eat new fry if  they can fit them into their mouths.  If this is a worry then you can buy a live bearer hatchery that contains 2 compartments.  That way keep the larger fry away from the new fry whilst keeping them both out the way of the much larger mouths looking for a protein snack...yum yum.  They sell hatcheries with 2 compartments and with an additional bottom section divided by a slotted panel.  The idea is you put the females in the top compartment and when they hatch they fall through the slots into the bottom thus keeping mum away from young.  The benefit for you is that all three are segregated from each other.  When fry are large enough to be taken out you just start again.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It's a question of size, not of age.  When the young guppies are big enough to get the new-born fry in their mouths, they older ones may eat the new babies.    Another question that comes up regularly here is, "How old should the fry be before I put them in the tank with adult guppies?" The same logic applies here. When the young guppies are significantly bigger than the mouths of the adults, the adults will not eat them. Guppies (and most other fish) swallow their prey whole; they don't bite off a little at a time.|`|NUIrBHXgaa	Think of it this way. If there small enough to fit in there mouths they will most likely eat them.|`|AA10709249	Probably as soon as younger fry exist. Remember that they need the energy-and are not sup milk like mammals.
nQdGGBN4aa	Living indoors does not make a cat fat.    All of our cats stay indoors and except for one of them, they are all of normal weight.    As someone else said, you can't put a leash on a cat and take it for a walk - at least not unless you spend an enormous amount of time, beginning when it is a kitten, getting it use to, first a harness, and second a leash and even then you might not be able to get it to walk on a leash.    I've heard of cats who will "walk on a leash" but they are extremely few and very far between.    If you want to exercise your cat, play with it indoors. Get some toy mice - the very small ones, about 1" to 2" long. I have never seen a cat that will not play with them.    Throw them for your cat to chase. Cats particularly like to go after things that are thrown up high - maybe racial memories of chasing birds???    Look at http://www.thecatconnection.com/page/TCC... see the Furry Mice? Those are like the ones we buy locally.    I have often wondered if they dip these mice in a mixture of purried real mice - the cats love them so much!    Look at the Spotnips 12 Pack Colored Fur Mice further down the page those are also like ones we buy here locally.    http://www.arcatapet.com/item.cfm?cat=37... also shows one of them.    Check Wall-Mart I think they carry these small mice. If not, check pet stores, or - last resort - order some online. I'm not recommending the sites to which I referred you, above. Those are just some I found with a quick google search.    As always is the case, check out an online retailer before doing business with them.    Also get other toys for your cat.     Don't go crazy buying all the things you see in the stores. Most of it is designed for the cat owner, not the cat.    There is a product named, I think, Cat Dancer. It is a flexible pole with a string at the end of which is feather.    You move  it around and let the cat stalk and attack the feather.    A simple 3 foot piece of rope is also a great toy. You hang on to one end and throw the other end so that the cat can chase it. Toss it up over the cat's head so it has to jump and twist to get at it.    Crumpled up paper makes a good chase and jump toy. Many things around the house can be used to play with your cat - or for the cat to play by itself.    My whole point is that, with a few toys and a human willing to play, a cat can get a lot of indoor exercise and have a lot of fun.    The simplest things suffice.     Play Center? Cardboard boxes. Put them in different positions - open side up so the cat can jump in. On their side so the cat can crawl in..    Even if you don't play with the cat, it can get all the exercise it needs by itself.    So, keep your cat indoors, play with it, and don't worry about it getting fat.    There are fat outdoor cats and fat indoor cats. It rarely has anything to due with whether they go out side or not.    Indoors is the safest place for a cat.    One last thing, since you live in a high rise - check that your screens are strong. It is rare that a cat leans on a screen hard enough to push it out, but it does happen.    If your screens are really weak, you might want to consider finding something you can put in front of the screen - I think there are products for this purpose available at hardware stores.    I think I've see something like this which was designed to make windows safer for children.    One last thing - the ultimate toy for a cat is another cat. Consider adopting a second cat.  --------------------------  Look at our web site about diabetic cats at http://www.sugarcatsimon.com    That URL will redirect you to the actual site which is at http://sugarcat_simon.home.att.net    The other URL is easier to enter and will be the address of the new site I'm working on.|`|ofmeZsoiaa	buy a pet playgroung from walmart or just get a ball of yanrn cut a piece of and wiggle it the cat will chase after it.|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	a pet playground lol try a kittie leash|`|M3maZgdyaa	Cats don't like going places. If you take her to a park you might lose her as she will run and hide. If she lives indoors you might not want to teach her about outside. She will drive you crazy with wanting to go out all the time and she can get fleas from outdoors.|`|fFtBqFB6aa	your cat will be fine as an indoor cat. If you feel the need to take her out, i would leash train her first.|`|mXecXR06aa	actually dear it is impossible to take your cat outside since cats aren'tlike dogs but at least you can take it out few meters because may be it will runaway|`|kvBTK7Alaa	Cats are made to be kept inside or not do a lot of activity unless it's a younger cat. I've never heard of a pet playground but if you want to get your cat to exercise( which is healthy) maybe you could get some toys and let them chase them around. Or if  you're allowed to let it run up and down the stairs. Maybe look around your area for something pets can do. Sorry if this didn't help.|`|6N4NoM6uaa	We've got 2 indoor cats. They never go outside and they never miss it.    I think it's very uncaring to let your cats out. Especially when there are lunatic people out there who intentionally target them with their cars.    Much kinder to keep them in than to let them out where there's cruel people, infections, other cats who want to fight them, dogs who want to kill them and just plain old accidents.    It's also kinder on the bird and small animal/insect kingdoms to not let them out.  Our cats are happy as all get out and don't want to go out.     You can actually train them to walk on leashes and you can even buy cat (pet) prams on ebay believe it or not.
RT8LZy7gaa	A visit to the vet to confirm the pregnancy might be a good idea.  Also, if the vet thinks she may need supplements during her pregnancy or a change to a different food to help her with maintaining her own weight while nursing hungry kittens, they can make that recommendation.    When the time comes, the cat will begin "nesting". Watch her carefully during this time. You may want to put her in a spare bedroom or a warm, not usually used bathroom.  Any not-high traffic area should do.  Give her a box or put some towels around. She'll cuddle up in them and you can change them out later.    Watch to make sure she's not having difficulty.  Not many cats have a hard time delivering.  If the vet has taken an xray to confirm the number of kittens, make sure they all come out! If she doesn't seem to give birth to all of them within 24 hours, give the vet a call to see what they recommend.    Be prepared for any stillborn kittens.  Removed them as soon as you can determine they are not alive (won't mew, wiggle or the mother rejects it and won't clean it off.)    Once all the kittens are born, keep them away from everyone else.      Purchase a nursing kit from your local pet store. It usually comes with a couple bottles, several types of nipples and some KMR (kitten milk replacement) just in case she rejects one or more.  I've handraised kittens before. they need feeding when they wake up and you have to stimulate them to urinate by using a warm moist cotton ball to cleanse them and make them pee (and if they poo, same thing). (BTW the three I raised weren't because the mother rejected them, someone found the mother hit by a car with the kittens near her - she must have been trying to move them).  Put a heating pad set on low covered with a few towels in a small box to keep them warm. You can also put a stuffed animal in if you have one so they can snuggle with it.    But nature will probably take over and she'll do just fine.  After all the kittens are born, the vet will probably want to check them out to make sure they're ok. They will tell you how long to wait before bringing them in - and bring mom because they'll want to check her for signs of infection and to make sure her milk supply has come in.    Check this link to find out the approximate date of your cat's delivery. http://www.catsunited.com/html/gestation...|`|QcKUyn6Daa	how to chatt?.....|`|naySyzfQaa	Just make sure she's comfortable and try not to touch the kittens but keep them near her and reassure that she's doing a great job during delivery.
5M57TTfpaa	it could just be that the female was trying to get some from the other female, cuz its a little srange that they have been together a year and you dont have any babies yet(if it was a male you most likely would have).    here is a link that might help you sex them all  http://www.debmark.com/rabbits/sexing.ht...    if you find out its a male, you should separate, because if they breed multiple times it could be bad.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	the rabbit is probably pregnant,  you can call around to vets and have all of your rabbits fixed so they can live happily together.  I would keep the male out of the cage until he is at least fixed.  its possible he mated with the other one too.|`|RjyNInW6aa	the rabbit is pregnant. Separate them all and put the female bubbles in a cage by herself. When about a month goes by you will probably have babies. You must be really quiet so the mom doesn't eat the babies. Hope this helps.|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	definatly seperate them.    There is good chance of your ladies being pregnant.. but a serious concern is how many times have they mated.. as what can happen is the doe can get pregnant one day, then the next day mate again and be pregnant twice in her other ovary, this will probably cause miscarriage and could even kill your bunny!    It is unfortunate mistake but the best thing is to go to your vets ASAP and see what you need to do next.
3p6wp7DYaa	She's a four month old puppy! There is nothing wrong with her behavior!!! I believe you should not worry about it. She is well behaved and not aggressive with you and your family. She doesn't even growl and show teeth when wrestling. I mean, this is model behavior as far as I have seen at the dog park. Dogs need the wrestling and the barking and chasing around. That's how they play, especially puppies. It is not even unheard of puppies biting each other. That is how they get bite feedback and how they learn what is acceptable social behavior in the canine society. Let her be!    As for the "pissy" dog owners, they should be banned, don't you think? Their dogs are the ones who are starving to get down and dirty (because they are always being stopped from normal play) and the owners are always the ones who decide it is time to go home before things get too out of control. Come on! What I learned to do at the dog park is to approach the person who starts to walk fast and stand right next to where my dog is trying to play with his or her dog and tell her straight up: my dog loves to wrestle. Is that ok with "your dog"? What I mean is if that would be ok with them, but being tactful never hurt anyone. Those people may be new to the world of dogs, so they are probably unsure if the wrestling is normal or if it is a fight. If they express any doubt or say something about not having had a dog before, explain that it is normal, but if they start biting each other YOU will jump in and take your dog away. If they say that their dog gets too excited and out of control and they don't want this kind of rough play, take your dog away and introduce her to another dog.    Good luck!|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	It is natural puppy behavior, but it is not advisable to let him be like this for the following reasons:-    Other dogs may not be as social and could bite a dog that gives unwanted and overbearing attention.    Other dogs could be smaller and get hurt, even though there is no malice.    The behavior is cute now, but in a full grown dog is very antisocial. A mother or pack members in the wild would naturally control this behavior and it would naturally fade out, but in a domestic situation where the handler does not control it, it can become worse.    If you find another owner that is happy for your dog and theirs to play like this, go for it, but be sure you can step in and stop the dogs when you want to.     As for owners who move your dog away from theirs, you need to apologies as it is your dog that is causing the problem for them. They have every right to protect their dog.     To remedy this, join an obedience class and through training, your dog will learn the correct way to meet other dogs and you will be able to have better control over her rather than her possibly becoming a nuisance.    As a final note, digging and sniffing butts is the most normal dog behavior there is, so people should absolutely go to a dog park to let their dogs do that. Maybe you could take your puppy for a little run before going to the park so that she runs off her excess energy.|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	Aussies can be very physical dogs in their play and enjoy "body slamming". She is a puppy and having a gas of a time.    However.....you need to be considerate of the other dogs at the dog park. She could injure someone else's dog, maybe not intentionally, but it still would be her fault, hence your fault. Another thing is that many dogs may not at all appreciate her exhuberant and somewhat rude behavior and may attack her when she body slams them, which again would be her fault.    I dislike dog parks. I do not want my dog to think she can approach any and all dogs without my permission. There are some very nasty dogs out and about.|`|ta1ALj4qaa	Too long...|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Your dog has nothing wrong.  Things about dog wrestling is dogs usually will tell the other that it goes too far by yelping or backing off or growling.  My rule of thumb in dog park is as long as there is no growling from both sides and both sides seem to enjoy (no running away), I will let them play.  But sometimes even good dogs can be overly excited...at that stage, I will call my dog and do some training and some walk to calm that mind.    And yes, some dog owners don't like dog wrestle.  In that situation, I usually divert my dog to other things, like balls and frisbee...|`|FJHU9PbUaa	I agree that some puppies are way more interested in rougher puppy play than others & as long as she isn;t being overly aggressive I wouldn;t worry about it,. She would act shyer around older males because she is more intimidated by them.  Older females may at some point put her in her place. I would take a few puppy classes to socialize her without having other people take offence & grab her. Any dog & owner benefit from obiedence classes, while you also get the proper socialization at the same time. She may run into a dog that may put her in her place & that would teach her quickly.   You could also take her for a run someplace besides the dog park & tire her out before going there & she'd be less excited. I'd take offence to anyone grabbing my too, not only do they risk getting bit, but they should ask you to control or remove your dog first, or they can just leave. I've met people who's large aggressive male dogs try to hump all new comers & the owners think it is funny & feel proud that their dog is so manly.  See if there is a time the dogpark is less busy.|`|2w21Xfp1aa	this is the way they play you dont have a problem|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Australian Shepherds like many other Aussie breeds like the Blue Heeler and the Kelpie were bred to work with other animals such as sheep and cattle. They are very intelligent and energetic and so need a lot of training and exercise to be well rounded dogs. Their herding instinct is very strong and they actually crave to be able to work. I have known kelpies to pine and die if they are unable to work as they get older. Your dog is unfortunately being a pest to the other dogs who do not have its zest for life and play and should be on a leash until she learns how to better interact with other dogs. To you it seems like play...to other owners with quiet sedate dogs it seems like your dog is playing aggressively with their dog. Try to see it from their point of view. It is your dog approaching theirs so it is your responsibility to keep your dog under control. The other owners dont know your dog or its temperament or even whether it has had its shots etc so I cant blame them for being a bit concerned if another dog bounds up to theirs and starts growling and wrestling and playfully biting theirs. You have chosen a breed that needs to be trained and controlled for its own good. They prefer to be kept in line...they are bred for it. Otherwise they are loose cannons that careen from one bad experience to another. If you see these dogs working they are fixated on their owners and cant wait to do their work. They crave to have a purpose. So you need to keep your puppy in line by leashing it and teaching it an acceptable way to greet and interact with other dogs. they could be old and sick, or aggressive themselves, or just had an operation or a hundred other reasons they shouldnt be jumped upon and wrestled with by your dog. Take your puppy to a training club and follow through every day by giving it a thorough workout. Your dog will love it and so will the people at the park.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	First off your dog sounds like a normal, active puppy. She is showing good puppy sense by ignoring the older, larger, more dominate dogs & picking pups her age & size to want to play with.  I don't  take my dogs to a "Dog Park", but my puppies & dogs are out in public with other dogs all the time. The unspoken rules of Dog-Dog interaction are these:  Don't allow your dog to interact/play/wrestle with another dog without asking the owner if this is OK. And then when the 2 dogs are interacting & playing, both owners need to watch their dog & stay alert for any signs that things are escalating to a level they don't want. And be ready to break off the play quickly if this happens.  Now what some dog owners think is acceptable play for their dog may differ from what others think. Some owners may be OK with the rough wrestling for their dog & others may not. Different people have different ideas. Not knowing the other person & their dog, it's hard to know how they feel about things. And let's face it, some people are just funny about their dogs, period.  What I suggest is asking the person first if it's OK for the 2 dogs to play & then watch & be astute to their interactions. If the dogs hit it off & play well together & both owners are like-minded about the play, then you have made new Dog Park friends. Look for these familiar people & dogs when you go to the park & let the dogs have fun. Be aware as puppies go through different stages growing to adulthood, they change. So always be alert & watch your dogs during any dog-dog interaction. Break it up if one starts to act "snarfy".  Aussies are bossy herding dogs. They play "herding dog" games. They will run circles around other dogs & body block. They're also very vocal when they play. Lots of  barking. Sometimes other dogs don't  understand the "herding dog" games. And people who aren't familiar misinterpret their actions. So always be alert when your dog is playing with others & be ready & able to stop it if necessary.    Oh & watch comments about "balls". A very personal issue for some people!  LOL LOL LOL|`|vPde97E2aa	EXACTLY as any pup will.......until a cranky adult chops it for being an obnoxious pest!!!    YOU are at fault for ALLOWING your nitwit to HARASS others!!   That's HORRIBLY RUDE & ILL-MANNERED=of YOU & the dog!!!    STOP it before it gets hurt &/or  get your uncouth donkey kicked out PERMANENTLY    If can't bear to hear the TRUTH,why do you ask? Just babble to your reflection.|`|AA10628838	Unless you want the behavior to continue after your dog is no longer a puppy, you should get your puppy under control. I can understand why some owners do not want their puppies becoming overly excited because they become hard to handle and give commands to when they become older. My bosses have an American Hairless Terrier which is an energetic dog. He knows not to behave this way with me, but the other members of his family have encouraged his bad behavior, and they cannot do anything with him. He is now over 2 years old.

If they are just little red bumps, it is probably fine, but if they are swollen, sore or oozing, I would definitely get a hold of the vet..they could be infected, or it could be an allergic reaction to something.|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	It's probably the stitches because when my cat got neutered that happened to.  Call the place where you got Toby neutered.  Or it could be swelling because that usually happens when you get surgery or it is infected or an allergic reaction.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Guppies have a 21-28 day gestation depending on tank environment (the better the environment and the more tropical the tank, the shorter the gestation). Without knowing when your fish became pregnant it's going to be a guessing game. When it's close her belly will be huge and become boxy in shape.    Guppies should NOT be kept in male/female pairs, that male could easily harass the lone female so much she aborts the fry or dies from stress and birth complications. Females also should not be put in "breeding boxes" prior to birth for similar reasons.     You need at least another 2 females per male, use dense plants like java moss in which any fry can hide. To be honest I'd leave at that as a survival of the fittest case (parents eat fry) otherwise you'll end up with potentially hundreds of guppies and noone to take them, no homes for them to go to.|`|AA10709249	No, guppies are fish, they don't give birth 'the human way'. Or to be more correct, the same way as humans. Mammals were giving birth before humans came along.|`|4Mm7Tau2aa	According to my intense calculations.   Right now.|`|0DkK8Tybaa	a Guppy is a Live bear, Which means she gives birth the human way, They don't lay eggs. If you Look Closely at the female guppy their should be a gravid spot. Which is a Dark Shaded Area near The Guppies Back.  Referring to how dark the gravid spot is and how fat she is, she should have her fry 'babies' soon. If the gravid spot is very light and you can hardly see it, that mostly means that she won't have her babies for 2-4 weeks.  Hope This Helps|`|oiTGhopBaa	Guppies do not lay eggs.   They are live bearers. Expect to have an aquarium full of guppies in the next few months. They breed like rabits and give birth about once a month, sometimes in less time sometimes in more time.     If you want to speed up their breeding get flakes made with ground up earth worms. For some reason live bearers breed much more prolifically when fed that food.    On the same note if you want to breed them I would suggest buying a breeder box. It is a little box that sits inside of your aquarium that you use to isolate the pregnant female from the rest of the fish. The babies are very small when born and when they are born all of your other fish see them as food. You have two choices for breeder boxes, the plastic ones or the netted ones. I would recommend the netted ones as babies have no way of escaping from there, also the female will not hurt herself if she tries to swim to fast.   Here are some pictures of what they look like:  http://www.fish.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=7102...    Good Luck and happy fish keeping.
fO1ZzPXyaa	I agree. Chocolate lab. Mine adores all children, and you'll never find a more loyal, loving friend. If you can keep it in the house, the love and security will double. I do. They're great house dogs, and very easy to house train.|`|KsqnIXcTaa	We have got a labradoodle puppy and he is great with my younger brother and sister who are 2. A very loving breed and obedient.|`|wSepFP0Laa	Maybe you should get dog from covert..? (sorry for my bad English:)|`|UpI7ZqyIaa	I have a chinese Shar Pei they are great with kids and a nice dog they are not to big or not to small. they enjoy playing mine loves a toy called a kong wubba they usually like to play in the snow.|`|KT0fPjvPaa	I would have to agree with Leah on this one.  Shar peis are great family dogs.  They act more like a canine cat than an actual dog.  It would love the backyard and it sheds very minimally.  They are very loyal and will bring many years of happiness and they are a really enjoyable dog.  My other suggestion would be a miniature dachshund.  They can adapt to a large backyard or small one, they shed minimally as well and they too are loyal and quite fun to have.  As far as a labrador, I can't say anything nice about them other than they are cute when they are puppies.|`|IBs1HPcEaa	Chocolate lab!!!|`|igpMQn0kaa	Bloodhounds are one of the top rated family dogs of all time. They usually can stand little kids torturing them, which is great. The thing is, with a baby to come soon, would you have enough time to take him for walks and do all the other stuff dogs need?    I'm not sure how you think about pitties, but they also make great family dogs.

odQewFgvaa	My boston terrier (10lbs) at 1 month of my birth control. He will be fine. Call the vet if you really want to be sure.      Labs do this. They are really smart when it comes to anything edible. Make sure you keep everything locked up. This is truly harder than it seems. I have a lab too.|`|D6AYSUvsaa	Call the vet immediately don't listen to make her vomit or she'll be fine, that won't help...|`|9kTejB0uaa	Phone your vet and ask.  I'd seriously doubt anybody around here has experience of this, or is qualified enough to advise you!!!  Some things genuinely are better left to the professionals to answer.    Happy event (for you) in 9 months' time???  lol|`|rRO3x9hZaa	call the vet and ask them|`|AA12083992	Call a vet or an emergency vet and ask them what you should do!|`|uO3FC4draa	Please call the vet asap!    Sometimes you need to induce vvomiting immediately but in some cases vomiting can make things worse.    Good luck, take swift action and chances are far better.    Labs are very sturdy and resilient dogs, hopefully you will just have a funny story to tell in the future.|`|3208995a056e331b2cc1bc88d9590058aa	don't worry, she just won't be having babies for a very long time            seriously tho you should prbly call the vet|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Don't get it the car and rush to the vets, but definitely call them, explain and they will tell you what to do.    Don't panic, but don't take the risk!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Take her to the vet NOW and pick up after yourself.  Anything you don't want the puppy chewing on gets put up.    Puppies and dogs that chew everything often don't get enough exercise.  Take this puppy running in the mornings, to a dog park in the afternoons(if you have one in your area).  If you don't have one in your area, make sure it has some other way of running around and socializing with other dogs, and run this dog in the evening again.  Maybe romp around and play with it in the yard.  Tire his butt out.    Get him rawhides, pigs ears, dentabones, real bones, etc etc etc to chew on.|`|7HGKJYenaa	You should definitely call the vet.  Dont waste anymore time, especially not waiting to see what "we" say,  if it is bad for her you may be too late.  When a dog eats something toxic they can react very quickly to it and the damage may be irreversible.  Hurry please, I hope she is ok.|`|24CFl7sjaa	Call the vet immediately.

I love them equally. They both are very playful, smart, and loving. The Chihuahua was MUCH easier to potty train than the Paps though, in my personal experience. They both can be quite posessive of their person- Especially the females. The Paps need more brushing due to their hair, but honestly I can't find much of a difference in their traits. Really I would visit a rescue or a reputable breeder and see their litters, you'll fall in love with one and there your answer will be! Of course, they always love a mate being pack animals :)    Please don't buy from a pet store... they get their pups from Puppy Mills!|`|8twsa18Iaa	get a boxer or a rottweiler. chihuauas are just overgrown rats. what is a chihuaua gonna do if you get mugged or attacked? a boxer would defend you to the death    but sure that would make it cosy|`|2vWSbAddaa	A papillion they are not as common and will maybe be appreciciated more, I hope this is your best answer  im only 7|`|D5RyA4gtaa	Well I have a mixture of both breeds.  I have a long haired Chihuahua that looks like a Papillon and has their disposition.  I have researched and found out to get long haired Chihuahuas they were mixed with Papillons.  Mine just happen to take after the Papillon side more.  She is the sweetest dog I have ever owned and would take another in a heart beat.  I would choose Papillon or long haired Chihuahua over regular Chihuahua.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would not take a dog to see clients.  Those clients may have allergies to dogs.      How about getting two dogs?    You can get adult dogs from shelters.    http://petfinder.com/|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	I used to work at a dog re- homing centre, and i would advise that you get a Papillon.  Chihuahas can be a bit nippy and not so friendly to strangers, where as a apillon would love the attention of other people who you see at work.    i also think that pappillions are a lot cuter!|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	Get both so they can keep each other from being bored and lonely when you are away|`|vPde97E2aa	No,you shouldn't.    Anybody that imagines mutt/mongrels are "ideal" has done zero research & just wants a current-fad ACCESSORY,not a real live dog.    There are ***26**** breeds in the Toy Group,plus DOZENS more in Terrier,Hound & Non-Sporting that mature under 20 lbs.    ADULTS research,not ask strangers-on-line to choose FOR them!|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	papillon.  mine goes every where with me and is very social.  i got told yesterday that all the small dogs she had ever seen were very yappy and biters.  she had never seen a small dog that loved everyone.|`|ofUe4hBkaa	first off any dog can be suited for appartment life if it as enough exercise, which you said you could provide so you should be fine.  im personally a "big" dog lover.  i own rotties dobies a bullmastiff and a bull terrier.  to the person who said rottweiler i tottaly agree with them. there great dogs and not at all viscious!  lovely family pets.  but if you are looking for a smaller dog, i would recommened an english bull terrier or bull terrier.  there great companions and will do fine in an appartment with enough exercise.  i really suggest you research the breed, as you will never be let down with a bull terrier|`|rFvowCrGaa	Papilon,  Chihuahua Look Like Rats :P|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	chihuahua s are cute|`|sUXyRlVjaa	Do not get two pups at the same time.  While it MAY work if you have the time to spend it's generally a very bad idea and no reputable breeder will sell two at once to anyone, especially anyone inexperienced.    With a mix you will not know which breed yours will take after unless you get a fully grown adult.  This dog will definitely be the product of a byb or puppymill type breeder.  If you want a mix put your name in at various shelters, rescue groups, petfinder, etc. when the time comes.    As far as the two breeds are concerned check out the following links for accurate (not get X or Y because it's cute) information:  http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...    http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...    They are very different breeds and only you can decide which would fit your life best when the time comes.  For now spend time doing more research, talking to breeders as well as owners of each breed, and going to dog shows and talking to people there.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Of the two breeds, I personally prefer the Papillon as a breed, their temperament is calmer and they are a better companion dog than the Chihuahua.  The coat does take some care, being long haired, but you can clip the coat short to make care easier.    I wouldn't take the dog to client sites unless you have permission up front.    Don't get two dogs immediately.  Train one first before you get a second, if that's what you want.|`|WyXr6Idmaa	I would say the papillon. My grandmother bred them and they were delightful little dogs and they are fancy - I personally think they have more class then chihuahuas. They could well suit your lifestyle and with good exercise they would be fine in a flat.
OjXvYEZDaa	Yes you can, no matter if female or male. It might be hard to do the introduce if your dog haven't grown up with a cat before and cat haven't grow up with a dog before ( its always best way to introduce when they are puppies/kitten grow up together much easier). But you can still introdoce them but do it very slowly, it gonna to take time. Once u bring cat home,take the dog out for a long walk/run to tire dow out. make sure keep dog in other room, let the cat sniff about. its horrible to keep them seperated only for temporaily but make sure you are giving dog attention too!, they must sleep seperated but swap thier toys every 24 hours to let them used the smell. put cat in crate cage to be safe without getting hurt by dog when u bring dog in to meet the cat. allow the dog see what it is there in cage if dog starts to growl tell her NO! and make her sit and lie down calmly I expect cat might be hissing at dog to set dog off.it might take a while. do it regularly, if your dog seem to be calm and  let cat out of cage (make sure keep your dog on leads) It took me 1 month finally got my 3 years old collie best friends with my 8 months kitten from very slowly introcding|`|JLOz9rXNaa	yes. a male cat|`|IYnxKUH7aa	yyahh my cat ollie play fights with my dog stan.....    annd they sleep together.... in the nice way lol    but be sure to intrduce them slowly as dogs are very territoial and if they see a unknown cat in there home.... it will go beserk|`|2HKltfZAaa	if your poodle were a boy and the cat was a boy,trust they will fight a lot.|`|AA12081491	Take your poodle with you to a shelter and see how she acts and reacts to another animal.  If she's friendly with a cat or kitten or even another dog, you've got your answer.      There's no major reason that she shouldn't get along with a cat or a cat with her, but it depends on her and the particular cat.    Our two dogs, a Lhasa mix and a Cocker mix, get along with our cat just fine. The Lhasa mix and the cat play together. I had a Shih Tzu that absolutely loved cats too.  But I have a friend whose Boston Terrier would not tolerate a cat in her territory.|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	Yeah go ahead. The sooner they meet the better they would get along. I don't know which gender you should get.|`|Amkmles0aa	no it will not i have seen dogs eat kittys  but if the dog is a mom and the one of the puppys die then you can put a kitty by the dog and be ok i did that in july 2008|`|YmLezz03aa	i would say yes, most likely a male cat. most female cats can be aggressive, but then again, who knows|`|cPeF163laa	i personally wouldnt, it but if you really want to, you should look for a cat thats calm, lazy and not aggressive, or if possible, why not bring your dog to the cat at the adoption place and see if they hiss or bark at each other.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	they wont get along|`|IGY2ofRBaa	with you saying introducing a cat to the home and not a kitten then i guess that would depend on if the cat is used to other dogs, or sharing a home with other animals all together.
AA12083992	No, he's a dog. Don't forget they greet each other by sniffing butts.|`|ZmFa6FL2aa	The first part of your question is a good one. Many dogs don't like to be pat on the head, they just don't, but they do enjoy a good scratch on the butt, hard to reach otherwise.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Have the vet/groomer clear his anal glands. He might also have dry skin thats itchy and he cant reach it so he wants you to =) try an oatmeal shampoo for dogs. I use head and shoulders shampoo on my dogs.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	He's just being a dog, nothing wrong here. Dogs always sniff eachothers back ends when they meet, this is normal.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	no omg he is not a homo.  my dog does that, and she wants it scratched, not rubbed lol.  i guess it's just a place they can hardly reach, and they want someone else to scratch it for them.      just like some people like it better when other people scratch their back|`|hDPLlWmBaa	Two reasons. Either he likes a good scratch or it could possibly be that he needs his anal glands expressed. I have a boxer with that problem, people scratching his butt seems to make him feel more comfortable. Try taking him to the vet or a groomer to see if they need to be done.
NBfBKI1Uaa	You are going to hear conflicting information or idea depending depending on whether they are a hard core fish keep or someone who keep fishes are a hobby. So be prepared to to here that hear.    Even I wouldn't keep a goldfish in bowl for a couple of reasons. First they are extremely messy and thus you will be changing the water in that bowl or tank every day.    Second they get too big for a bowl.    A excellent candidate is a betta. Betta is live dirty and murky waters of rice paddies in south east Asia. And this is why thy have developed a a modified gills called labyrinth organ which allow them to breath water directly from the surface. So the water doesn't need to be in great quality.    And this is the reason betta are kept in small bowls. They are an ideal candidate for a fish in a bowl. I would still recommend a changing the water at least 3 or 4 days.    -rds|`|OsVswissaa	No fish is suitable for living in a bowl.  Not even a betta, they need heaters.|`|NCBDNMLXaa	My daughter has been keeping a beta in a bowl for a more than year now.    Just be sure to change the water regularly and don't over-feed.    Good luck.|`|0DkK8Tybaa	You can keep all Cold Water Fish in A fish Bowl,  GoldFish Are Suitable For Bowls But Just Not Big Gold Fish Like Black Moors.  You Can't Keep Tropical Fish in Bowls Such As Guppies, Mollies ect,  Unless You Have A Heater. You Cannot Have a Heater in a Plastic Bowl it has to be a Glass bowl. Hope this helps.|`|AA10645224	DEAD ONES|`|YoLa0aE8aa	Beta are probably the best I've had three for about 7-8 months now and i just change the water every other week and try to keep the food at a steady rate. Also be sure to not group them together they are very aggressive towards other Fish.|`|mXecXR06aa	it is wrong   you can put goldfish where ever you want but the  most important thing is to keep the bowl clean|`|MhgLNm3daa	I would only keep a betta, and only if you commit to keeping its home clean.  A plant that grows up out of the water could absorb the fish's wastes and use it as fertilizer.  I don't know of any aquatic plants that don't need bright light.    The advice to change water in a goldfish bowl is troubling- goldfish secrete a pheromone into the water that inhibits their growth.  This is why a goldfish in a tank can be small for years, then grow large when placed in a pond.  With regular water changes, the fish doesn't get the signal to stop growing and outgrows the bowl.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Plastic ones. Goldfish crackers.    Bowls are for flowers, NOT fish.    Bettas can live in a bowl BUT only live NOT thrive and by being in an unfiltered, unheated bowl they will be far more likely to get sick, jump out, tail bite and ultimately die. They are delicate tropical fish.    No fish deserves to live in an inadequate environment for selfish and aesthetic human reasons.    Anyone who is educated in the basics of water chemistry would understand why an unfiltered under maintained bowl doesn't work for fish. Unless you go down the route of the Walstad Method, but even then its best invert only and not with fish.    If you want to keep fish do it PROPERLY with a tank, filter and heater if you're going tropical.    Http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Beginning...    Edit: you canNOT compare water in a rice paddy or stream to water in a small unfiltered bowl. That paddy water is not dirty, that mud is a filter, it keeps the water HEALTHY combined with rains and plants. It's far from being dirty! Unlike the tiny toxic volume of an unfiltered bowl. As for the labryinth organ, the paddy water in summer will be very warm and low in oxygen, which is why that organ evolved. NO FISH can live in shoddy water quality!    I've been on this site too long to be polite. It turns you into a cynic. Get over it.    And no aquatic shops I've come across in the UK keep their Bettas in cups, they're either in specialist filtered Betta tanks/compartments in the main filtration system or with carefully selected tank mates in the main tanks.|`|AA11708471	If the bowl is over 5 gallons and it is filtered and heated you can keep a betta    and i see nothing wrong with catx answer    my local fish shop keeps their bettas in comunity tanks|`|AHEFXgE7aa	If it a big bowl with some plants, and a small air pump filter, you can put one betta in it.  Do weekly water changes.    Cheers|`|DapNp1Kxaa	Bettas are beautiful, and do really well in bowls. I had one named Moby, who lived in the bowl I had my lily plant in, and he lived for 5 years. You can't put two males together, tho, they will kill each other, and the females aren't as pretty but will live peacefully together, either with another female, or with a male. Watch their tails for signs of Ick, little spots of white, they can die from it. Other than that, they are happy just floating around, looking gorgeous.
AA10029366	Dachshunds are prone to vertebral disk problems, especially if they are overweight, allowed to jump up and down off high furniture, or poorly bred.    It sounds like your poor little dog has a back injury. Did you vet do x-rays? If not, I would have her spine checked out ASAP!|`|vPde97E2aa	Well golly gee,Maudie,paralysis means SPINAL INJURY!!!|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Sounds like she'd hurt her back, common in these dogs. She could've injured a disk by jumping off the couch or really anything, it doesn't take much. She may be fine with anti inflammatories to reduce any swelling & control her pain. get her back to teh vet as back injuries are really painful.|`|HSLMHpyEaa	My friends dachshund had the same problem.  He had a slipped disk that required surgery.  I took him about 8 months before he started walking normally again.  Take him back to the vet and get an x-ray done.|`|sW8eg01saa	i know for a fact that dachshunds can hurt their back very easily i own two of them. you need to take her to the vet and get her help immediately.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Take her back to the vet today. She'll need a spinal x ray and the vet will know what to do following that. It's not uncommon in this breed.    Good luck.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Ya think maybe there's a problem there??? huh???? Gee who could tell you what is really going on???? ahhhhhh...A VET :0 Wow an original thought....NOT!    After that last comment I think I would find a new vet. You took a paralized dog to a vet and they told you to come back later????? Honey you need a new vet now!!!|`|BBbFW1vlaa	sounds like everyone else is right on, i would guess a spine injury, perhaps a a slipped disc in her spine, This happened to my dog, she looked like a "snake dog",  we were able to treat this with low cost medication, Rimadyl and Tramadol I believe they are called.. Good luck!
989ac102f237076a0a42fc734f1d9297aa	Proin is a great drug.  Unfortunately, she probably has a sagging or displaced bladder from being forced to breed for so long.  I doubt that her urinating is behavioral or that she does it to get you angry. Poor baby.  I am forever fostering an incontinent dalmatian for a rescue.   Probably not the solution you want but I just bought a Swiffer (they are not hazardous to animals) mop and mop a lot.  One site:  veterinarypartner.com might have some info for you.    Ginni in TN|`|gwUMipsUaa	Perhaps kidney failure?  Take her to the vet and have all of that checked out.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	As an old abused breeding dog, she may now have a weak bladder and she may not be able to control her need to go. You just may have to put up with it - or put out numerous papers for her to pee on, one in every room in the same spot. see if she can use that.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	old dogs tend to do this, guess they can't hold it like they used to, keep it outside|`|Id9ce5kPaa	I rescued a puppy from the shelter, she was 6 or 7 weeks when I got her.  She is 6 months old now and on occasion still goes inside.  I tried hitting her with newspaper but that made her scared of me so i stopped.  Now i keep her on the leash inside the house so she goes where i go,  try that.  My problem is getting her to let me know she has to go outside to pee, it's crazy because she scratches on the door to come inside but will not even go to the door when she needs to go outside, she waits until i bring her outside.  Good luck and hope i helped, the leash thing will make you be able to catch her doing it, then just tell her no and take her outside, also praise her with treats when she goes outside.  Good luck!|`|7p2IknBOaa	Is there a small area in which you can keep her?  You can line the area with pee pads or newspaper so that if she pees, you can just change that area.  Golden retrievers are kind of bigger dogs, so they age faster.  At this point, she probably has lost bladder control.  I'm sure that if she was peeing in the house on purpose, she wouldn't do it right in front of you.  There are doggy diapers too that you could use, but I'm not sure how sanitary that would be for the dog, with all of that hair.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	Take her to the vet and have her checked for any medical conditions including, but not limited to, a UTI, spay incontinence, or senility (yes dog's can have this happen also).  All three, as well as other medical problems, can be cured or at least controlled with the proper medication/s and management.    Remove the pee pads.  All those are doing is telling her it;'s ok to go in the house and that could be confusing her.  Instead take her out more often (treat her like a puppy for now).  And, if necessary for overnight, put doggy diapers on her -- the ones used for b*tch's in heat.    Follow the housebreaking rules for pups with her:  1. Everything on a strict schedule.  2. No unsupervised freedom. she's with you or confined in a crate, pen, or easily cleaned dog-proofed room.    3. Take her out, don't just let her out. Praise her when she goes outside and put a word or phrase to the action to teach her to eliminate on command.  4.  Correct her (after eliminating medical reasons) if you catch her going inside. But, only if you catch her in the act.    5. Take up all food and water about 2 hours before bed to greatly reduce overnight problems. But confine her at night per above.    6.  Clean up all past and future accidents thoroughly using an enzyme cleaner to destroy the odor at the molecular level.    But the first order of business is a trip to the vet!|`|XNnx8aquaa	...That's what my golden retriever did before she died. ):|`|lFPsPzxzaa	she must be loosing bladder control|`|gUHgRkELaa	Is she squatting at all? She may not have control over it. I have an 11 year old pit/chow female and just recently she started losing control. She drinks water like nobody's business as well. The vet told me that her body is starting to give out. Hopefully in your case it is different. Best of luck to you.|`|jOG9D1Ruaa	If you get a dog door you can teach her that is the place to go. it will take a while but once she learns outside is the place to go she will go out there insted of in there house. Just make shure you have a gate.
94d7ab1dc0cbf0c83da720b731b0f8a2aa	saddle seat as in saddlebreds or walking horses? plantation pleasure is a walking horse class. saddleseat is a broad term that covers many breeds and types of classes. a winning horse in a saddleseat class depends on the breed, type of class, and division (like plantation pleasure, trail pleasure, country pleasure, etc..). a plantation pleasure horse performs a true 4 beat flat walk, a faster and more animated running walk, and a canter (if the class doesnt say speciality, speciality classes do not canter). plantation horses should be free and easy moving, comfortable for the rider, responsive, quiet in the bridle, and true in their gait (consistant). here is what the gait should look like: (this is a western plantation class but the gait is the same regaurdless. look at the flat shod videos)     http://www.twhbea.com/breed/gaitsvideo.p...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dex5yHFqN...|`|GpMRWESUaa	It depends on the breed of horse & whether it's a gaited class or if they just call w/t/c. Consistency and collection is always a winner. If all the horses are consistent & collected then you have to look into the breed specifics.
y7H1V39Jaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdbG4umWK...    This is a You Tube clip of a 4-H pleasure cart driving class, it is with minis, but you look for the same things.      1/  Horse under control, in hand (no slack in the lines but not tight either)  2/  Horse remaining collected and not resisting the bit nor appearing to     be working too hard pulling the cart.  3/  Of course they have attire standards that are usually different at about every show, so you have to bone up on that particular show.  4/  Judge likes to see a four footed flat walk like the horse has a job and is on his way to do it, deliberate in other words, moving on  5/  When asked for a trot, you want to see a cadenced trot, but you don't want to see their long trot until you ask for it.  The driver should always keep some in reserve and not just go faster, but the horse should stretch out and actually take longer strides.  6/  I was surprised to see the judges ask for a walk from a long trot, usually they will bring them back to a regular trot, then a walk, like in English riding classes.  7/  You don't want to see the shaking of the head like you saw in the clip, you want to see compliance, willingness and eagerness to please on the part of the horse.    8/  I don't know if you are also judging the driver, but the drivers hands should be close together at all times, having the horse in hand (no slack or sag in the lines), slight bend in the elbows and looking right down through the ears of the horse.  9/  You want to see the driver take his/her time in the reverse but also keep up with the other carts  10/  Backing straight is preferable  11/  I would get a set of the rules that is given to the drivers and study that as a guide.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	I was in 4-H as an equestrian judge.  Though we never got the opportunity to judge a driving class I believe you would follow the same criteria as you would with a pleasure under saddle class.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	The 2 major things are appearence of horse and driver and also how well you work together as a team.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	it depends on if it is open or working.  junior.'s .. the horse will mostly be judged for "suitability" to be driven my a minor.  they are also  judged on way of going, presentation of horse (harness fit etc), and your driving ability.  They now also feature dressage tests, which are judged on each movement the horse does.  some classes are judged on the turnout of driver and horse.  carriage dog - the dog is judged mostly...only about 20% on the horse.  scurry's and cones are judged on speed. they are not just for combined driving anymore, and alot of shows feature these classes as a warm up for later in the spring - for combined driving.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Its really breed dependent.  What breeds will you be judging?    This last weekend I was at Denver Stock Show with the mules competing and we compete at the same time the drafts do.    The judge said it better than I have ever heard... he looks for controlled fire breathing dragons.  Thats exactly what those drafts are.  They are forward, straight, actiony, and look like they are there to strut their stuff.  Now for mules.. you bring a mule out there like that and you will be asked to leave lol.    The mules are to be forward, straight, pulling into the collar or breastcollar, a pleasure to drive and responsive.     For me personally, I prefer to see less whip action and a animal that is commanded through reins and voice.  More whip action does detract from the overall picture and placings.    You want them to back straight and with ease, no sulling up or mouth gaping.    You also want to see them in turns, push into the shafts with their shoulders and smoothly turn.     Also, the overall picture with the outfit is very important.  They are to wear dark brown gloves, have a whip in hand at all times.  Their outfit should compliment their vehicle and horse.  You can get so very technical with russet colored harness with wooden vehicles and black harness with metal ones.  They must wear a lap robe with dresses, its breed specific with pants.     I have a wooden vehicle with black leather points and a black biothane harness that looks very nice but in a high quality driving show, I would need leather harness.    ADS *American Driving Society* can help you with alot of questions on their page.  I would also send off for their book too.      What state are you in that they do driving in FFA out of curiousity, here in WY they don't.  I think that rocks.    http://razzmyass.tripod.com/mysonandispi...    Theres my website with a bunch of driving pics, keep in mind that some of these are at playday shows so not dressed to the hilt in them.  But it helps give you an idea of what an animal should be turned out in.  The wooden cart is a meadowbrook, the smaller cart is called an easy entry and perfect for green driving animals.

In fact this question will probably go out for voting like many of them do.  Your one month old (4 weeks) should be with its mother for another 4 weeks before you bring it home.  In the meantime read a couple of good puppy training books to answer your question.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	A pup that young is way too young to learn anything. it shold be with it;s mom & littermates learning pack rule, play wrestling with it's brothers & sisters,  learning what is & ins't accceptable in a pack & besides at 4weeks they sleep alot.  The main thing you can teach that young is only not to bite, with a  no, a small bump under the chin, or a second of holding it's mouth closed. Wait until it is about 8-10weeks before you try anything else besides no bite & potty training.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	When you say 1 month dog, do you mean you've had the dog one month.  I certainly hope it's not the dogs age?    There are many excellent training books on the market.  One of the best, in my opinion, is "Mother Knows Best," by Carol Lea Benjamin.  There are also good on line training sites such as the one at http://www.dogproblems.com.  In addition there are books at your library as well as obedience and/or puppy training classes that you can enroll in.    By team, do you mean group?  That does not matter when it comes to obedience training.    But, if your dog is only a month old, it needs to be with it's mother for at least another month.  If that's not possible please find an older, friendly dog to let it be with as much as possible for the next month or you could be facing problems down the line.|`|AA12083992	First of all the pup should be with his mom till he is 10-12 weeks old.

Please make sure that your puppy's getting the right kind of food. Here are some tips, http://xrl.us/becgzw.    Then, when you're both ready, try some of the basic obedience commands shown here, http://xrl.us/becasp
AA12083992	The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck    You are right to crate her. Her crate is small enough? Get up earlier in the mornings and walk her till she craps. Give her a chance to eleminate before you go to work.  As soon as you get home, walk her till you are sure she is finished. Same at bedtime. You may need to hire someone to walk her midday.I am amazed she is pooping so many times a day at her age. I don't know what you are feeding her but poor quality food with all the fillers can cause dogs to poop more. A good quality food produces a smaller, less frequent, less stinky stool. Our pets need quality  food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

I'd recommend setting her up in an exercise pen to that the cycle of being a "dirty dog" is stopped.  There comes a point with some dogs that they just don't care any more if they are laying in their own filth and you need to avoid that endpoint.    Set her up in a laundry room or another small room with linoleum or tile flooring.  Put a baby gate across the door to keep her in the room (and make sure the room is otherwise puppy-proofed.  If you don't have such a room then purchase an exercise pen (puppy playpen) and set it up in the kitchen or another room with sanitizeable flooring.  In the small room or pen set up a blanket or bed and her crate and a SEPARATE area to potty.  You can get a Second Nature doggie litter box (I personally have used these with great success) or put down newspaper or puppy piddle pads.   This new area will break the cycle of frustration for both you and your pup.    Good Luck!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Figure out what time she poops in the mornings and get up earlier.  Or let her out about 2 or 3 am to poop.    She's in the crate too long at a time.  Have someone come in once or twice a day to take her out to potty if you can't come home on breaks.  If these don't work, it may be best to give her to someone who does have time for a puppy.    I would have told you to get an adult dog, because potty training is such a bear.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	crate is to big.  ask your vet.|`|YV1bOajXaa	Five months old is a little young to expect her to hold it for 8 - 9 hours a day.    Not knowing your schedule or when you feed and take her out, here are some things that come to mind.    1. Feed her early in the morning so the food has time to digest enough to make her want to poop before you go to work so that you can take her outside to do it.    2. For nighttime - feed her earlier, again so the food has time to digest and she can go outside to poop before bedtime.    What type of food are you feeding her?  Perhaps she has a allergy to it or her stomach is digesting it so fast that she poops more often?    Have you considered hiring a pet sitter to come in mid-day to take her outside?  As I said, that is a  long time to expect a dog, let alone a puppy, to hold it.|`|9kTejB0uaa	When I mentioned to my vet that my puppy was, right from the get to, peeing in her crate, she said feed her in there and it will stop.  I did, and it did!!!    However, if you are expecting your puppy (and that frankly includes any dog) to be clean in her crate for 8 hours a day - forget it!!  She can't.  And because of this she now has no respect for her crate in terms of making it a pee/pooh free zone, whether you are there, or not.  And in fact she may be going more than she really needs to as a form of protest to you - because she hates being left alone for these long periods of time, never knowing when you are going to turn up.    I'm sorry, I realise people do have to work and be away for 8/9 hours a day, but if you want to keep a dog under those circumstances, then you will have to expect mess.  I had to go back to work part time (and that meant 3 whole days a week, 9 - 5 plus travelling) because of financial circumstances.  My adults could not go for the length of time I was away.  I had nobody I could trust to go in and let them out so I had to put newspaper down, which bless them, they used.  But yes, it was coming home to a massive clean up job.  While it lasted.  As soon as I could quit again, I did.    You have some serious decisions to make here but you are expecting too much of this young dog, in terms of being clean in the house.|`|ZS6GHluraa	shes to young right now to hold her pee/poo for that long. when my golden retriever a 5 months, we had to take him out 3-4 times a day. now that he's 8 months, he waits until we take him out without any accidents and we only take him out about 2 times a day. if your pup keeps doing her business in the crate, she might get used to it. you should keep her somewhere else. like a bathroom or kitchen with those kid fence thingys. good luck|`|RqcLxDesaa	you know, some dogs are just dirty by nature and some breeds are worse than others. she obviously just doesn't care if she's covered with poop! but I feel for you, I clean up dogs for a living. what is her feeding schedule? perhaps you need to adjust it so she's not sitting in a kennel with a full gut all day. feed her when you get home and then excersize her. provide chewies and toys to keep her occupied. if all else fails, you might consider a 'drop pen' which is a cage with a grill floor, so everything falls through. at least she won't have it all over her. I've had a couple of dogs like that, and when I placed them in homes where they were given the run of the house, the problem stopped. you could try graduated her to larger areas and see how she does. she very young, she may just outgrow it. Good luck!|`|aZi6BvBraa	She probably thinks her crate is her toilet, that its ok to go there. Does she ever go outside her crate?  I would get rid of the crate for a while, you say you dont want to because you think she will dirty the house. Why not try to keep her in your bathroom when you are not around? It is a good area to test her, if she only poos in her crate. plus, if she does go there, its easy to clean :)    I have been in the same situation after I adopted an adult dog, that never got housetrained. it is Very Frustrating to spend so much time cleaning up after her. But she is almost housetrained now.  However, maybe the 8 hours is too long for a pup her age? you might be able to find a neigbour or a friend that can take her out for a quick walk when you are at work?  Also, do you walk her, or just let her in the garden? When you walk her, make sure she does her business before you bring her back in. Also, when she does her business outside, praise her, give her a little treat when she does go outside, this way she will start associating doing her business outside with a positive. Instead of the negative of doing it isnide.|`|9XKDa9lkaa	Background: I have four dogs currently - 2 Cockerpoos, a Boston Terrier, and a Dachshound.    Dogs are creatures of habit. In the morning, you pick up the dog. carry her outside to the area where you want the dog to do her business.  If the dog does not go, bring her inside returning it to the crate.  After 5 minutes, reaeat the process until the desired result is achieved.  Lots of praise.    The crate should be small, just enough room to turn around.  She does not want to lay in it's own eliminations.    You might consider reducing the amount of food you are giving your dog.  The dog should only eat once a day.  Usually, the dog needs to go out 15 minutes after it eats.  Do not leave a full bowl of food down.  After she eats, that is it for the day.    Hope this is of some help.  I have had success using this method.|`|geJM58L2aa	Five months is too probably too young to be completely potty trained but a way to calm it down is to make the crate smaller.  Most crates come with a separator.. make the cage just big enough for your puppy to be able to lay.  She won't want to lay in her own poop so she'll hold it as long as she can.  8-9 hours may be too long but that's something you can't change so she'll just have to learn over time.      My husband and I used to come home to our puppy's cage covered in pee and poop.  Once we put in that separator and made her cage about1/2 the size it was before she's not close to as bad as she used to be because she doesn't want to have to lay in anything. Also, you have to show your puppy that as soon as you get home she's going to be able to go outside.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	i think the best solution for you is really get up earlier enough to let her poop outside and let her poop before you leave...and hire a dog walker in the mid day or enroll her to a doggy daycare...    It sounds like lots of work or money, but unfortunately that's the down side of dog ownership.  I have a seven mths old dog.  He is an easy keeper.  But when he is younger, sometimes I need to get up as early as 4am because he wants to go washroom.  I take him outside whether it's 2am or there is a blizzard when he is a puppy to create this good habit.  Pretty much in the beginning, the moment he wakes up at night, I take him out.  I have lots of dark circles but it pays off.  When dogs need to go at night, he usually makes this hmmhmmmhmm soft noise.  Even he is seven mths now, he still poops three to four times a day, which is very normal.  One after breakfast (right after wake up), two hours after breakfast, around 4pm and may be around 8:30pm sometimes.  It will be like that till past one year or even longer, depends on the development.    I really think physically she just can't hold it and may be she still doesn not know the right washroom route.  My dog will walk around the door and turn around giving me that "mommy, I need to go" look.  If you live in condo, not my first choice, but you can train her using the pee pad and then confine her to a small area....(use a playpen)|`|xAD64BkAaa	ok so my puppy has been left in his crate for 8 hours a day since he was 8 weeks old. my boyfriend and i both hold full time jobs, so we're in the same boat as you. 99% of dogs will not mess their crate because the don't want to sleep in it.   1) Your crate might be too big, they feel they can poop in one corner and sleep in the other and they don't care. put that dog in a smaller crate.   2) Try and change your feeding time, earlier in the morning so he/she will go poop before work. or don't feed until you get home.     try those things, and then eventually, when he/she stops messing the crate slowly make it bigger. (they have 'resizeable' ones)    i agree, it is tough for a dog to spend that much time in a crate, it's still hard for me to do and our dog is 8 months now.    he did pee in the crate when we started, but that seems harder for them to hold then poop.     good luck!!
FJHU9PbUaa	You have to really shock him wiith your NO! A quick bump under his chin (that he doesn;t see coming) is usually a very effective method too. Sometimes a NO! & holding his mouth shut for a second works too.You have to say/do it very quick & firm so your reaction really surprises him. Then IGNORE him for a few minutes, don;t go back to playing with him or petting him. (kinda like a timeout) It should improve, he wasn;t able to learn from his mom about nipping since he was taken away too young, a mother dog will correct a pup for nipping too hard.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Tell your boyfriend to get the name of that kid's parents and report them to your local shelter.  If he knew the kid was 11, he could have also gotten some names.  It's illegal in most states to give or sell a puppy before six weeks of age.  Those parents will continue to breed their dog(s) and use the kid to peddle puppies that are way too young.|`|HSLMHpyEaa	Puppies nip, but some don't always grow out of it.  Give him a firm tap on the nose.  It's sensitive so don't pop him too hard.  Then tell him NO in s stern voice.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	My first suggestion would be to yelp loudly if he chews on you, even slightly. Let him know it hurts. Since he was taken from his mother and siblings too early, he has missed some very important lessons on etiquette and bite inhibition, so it's your job to teach him those lessons as best you can. Even if he just bites clothes, yelp loudly and stop the play or ignore him in some other way. When he apologizes (usually in the form of licking) or plays more gently, praise him.  Good luck!|`|7M8Pf378aa	First of all, please dont tap your puppy on the nose, that is where all the nerve endings are and that hurts the puppy more than is needed. A firm NO and if needed even to hold him by the scruff of the neck at the same time, ( mother dogs grap the pups by the scruff ). It sounds like he has been lucky enough to have found owners that are giving him a better chance at life than the person who took him away from his mother far to early.  Puppies play with their mothers by biting, its their way of playing and he doesnt realize he is doing wrong, get him some play toys and play with him with them, praise him for doing good, and if he nips at you instead of his toy, a firm NO and if that does not work, say NO again firmly and a quick grab on the scruff of the neck, Yes he will probably whine or wimper or sound very hurt but hey nobody likes to be told no, he will soon learn what is acceptable and what is not, in saying that, your puppy is going to be teething and will be needing big bones, rawhide  etc to chew on at this stage  as well. He will learn by you being consistand, not hitting his nose as that only confuses and hurts him and he will retaliate, and maturity, dont forget he is only a very young puppy and all youngsters have to live and learn. Oh and your other dog wont like him to start with as he is very young and nippy still and is getting a lot of attention so will be a bit jealous. All the best .

DO NOT SHOW HER THE LITTER BOX! LET HER FIND IT HERSELF!  5. keep her in the room, for 2 - 3 days feeding her favorite foods, going in to play and give affection frequently, and make shure to clean the litter box as soon as she uses it.  this method has worked for me several times.  good luck!
61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Hi,48 hours is a long time for a dog to go with out food.  Have you tried frying a bit of liver in water.Maybe she will eat that.  Has for baby food try rusks.Hope she soon starts to eat.  Good Luck|`|cnZlMojUaa	I went through vomiting and anorexia with my dog when she was having kidney failure. It was so hard to get her to eat anything. Kidney failure "should" show up on the bloodwork, but the kidneys need to be at 70%-75% failure for the Creatinine and BUN levels to show elevation.    If you try baby food, check the ingredients and get something that doesn't contain onion or onion powder. If you try a chicken broth, get a low sodium and get one without onion. Onions can be toxic to dogs. You want to avoid foods with high salt/sodium, onion seasoning, and high fat foods. I used chicken and beef baby food. Soaking the dog's normal kibble in a warm low sodium, low fat broth could tempt her to eat.    I did need to feed my dog Hill's prescription A/D for a few days. It is a high nutrient canned food that is very thin (think potted meat). I could warm it with a little water and put it in a syringe. Syringe feeding is a last resort and should only be done with your vet's approval. I am just mentioning this food as a temporary thing. I don't think it is the best food around and you would not want to feed this long-term.     Is your dog getting any medications for nausea? It is good that you are staying in contact with your vet. He/she knows what is best. I hope your beagle feels better soon. Make sure she drinks so she stays hydrated.    Added: if your vet is suspecting a uterine infection, research pyometra. This can be life-threatening. My husband's cousin almost lost a basset hound to this. Pyometra can lead to an emergency spay and due to the infection, it is more dangerous to the dog and more expensive than the original spay. My dog was prescribed the two medicines you listed. The Cerenia will help with nausea. It is good your vet is keeping an eye on Misty. It is good you are using a probiotic to help with her stomach. I can tell you love your girl very much and it sounds like you are getting her good medical care. I hope her appetite picks up soon. I understand it is scary.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would get a second opinion and discuss food allergies with the vet.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	I'm not a vet and I don't pretend to be like some others but, I had a dog with the same symptoms once.

I have been there and done that! I have had the same issues with my male and this last time I though for sure we were going to lose him! I was told to feed turkey and brown rice! Well I bought and cooked a turkey just for him! He still did not eat right a way! Drinking water is a good thing. I sat on the floor with him and tried to hand feed him, he still was not interested but I pulled out his frizzed dried duck treats and he would eat those then I would sneak in a piece of turkey and then he would eat on maybe 2 pieces of turkey and I would stop there because you dont want him to eat to much and get sick again! I also started giving him pepto bismol 2 times a day. I hope this helps! One more note I found out that it was grains that were causing him to get sick and I started feed a grain free diet and he has not gotten sick once! Just a thought!        EDIT: I feed both of my dogs yogurt! Just about everyday! I would personal start with the food! She could have a allergic reaction to the food! Like the grains!

If you go to their website at www.homemadedoggydinners.com you will see that the food they make is 100% Human grade, all natural only from the USA ingredients - So many of their customers came to them because they had health issues with their dogs and they are now resolved.  my own 13 year old Bichon was on medicine for arthritis and allergies and now he is like a dog half his age.  Contact them and they can give you more information.  Your dog needs the correct balance of ingredients to cure his stomach issues.  My friends dog was hospitalized with stomach problems and he is now on Homemade Doggy Dinners and no more problems.  My dog is a member of my family and I will only feed him the best quality food available.
diMkiNNCaa	redness can occur in guinea pigs fairly normally as they tend to sleep with their eyes open.   as long as the guinea pig is acting fine otherwise then it's fine. If the eye gets worse then you'll need to take it to a vet.   things to watch for:  crustiness  discharge (colored or otherwise)  Lack of appetite  lethargy  sitting very still with eyes closed    DO NOT use people meds on guinea pigs without a VET's ok. Guinea pigs may get tested on for many things but don't experiment with your pets life. Many people use human or small animal supplies on guinea pigs and this can kill them. A vet is the only one you should trust on what products are safe for your pet.   That or a respectable guinea pigs owner with lots of experience. (meaning their pets are well taken care of or spoiled, and that they are regularly taken for check ups etc.)|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	I was raised on a farm and when we had problems with the farm animals with this very type of issue we used Boric Acid which you can get at any drug store, I have successfully used it on my guinea pigs for years with great success. It is one of just a few things that is safe for a guinea pig as they are so sensitive.Do not be afraid to use it, if you can afford a vet of course take it but if not i am telling you this is a tried and true formal that is safe and works well.|`|5385f45a70dcab7bbb5e7da5f3034aeeaa	Might be just some mild allergy ir some hair just got in its eye.  Leave it for a week and if gets worse you can use human remedies as my old vet recomended for me.    Like your normal off the shelf eye drops or eye washes you can drizzle over its eye.... good luck if you try though since they squirm n scratch a lot, I had to have help from a second person to apply anything from drops to ointments for a fungal infection on mine.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I wouldn't feed mealworms as a staple, more as a treat. Their hard casings can cause digestive problems. Use softer food like bloodworm and pieces of shrimp also. You can also use live feeder river or ghost shrimp also.
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What kind of "Dinosaur Eel"? That common name can be applied to several species of fish!    If you mean a Bichir, then these fish may well become aggressive towards one another as they mature, especially if the tank is on the small side (ideally at least 55-75 gallons for one presuming the smaller Senegal Bichir, other species get much larger). Being the same size it may not be that they eat each other, but one may push the other around.    If you mean Violet Goby, these are brackish fish which are also best kept alone with no other bottom dwellers or others of their own kind. They can be kept with top dwellers but are otherwise quite territorial.|`|9jxbZwU4aa	Most "Dinosaur Eels" I've seen at the chain stores are some species of bichir, senegalus bichir, most often.    It's always a crap shoot when partnering fish like bichirs.    A bichir will put any fish it can fit into it's mouth...well.....into it's mouth.  It may avoid eating spiny creatures like catfish and other bichirs, but a hungry bichir will try.    I've seen two adult bichirs living comfortably in a 100 gallon tank with plenty of caves and drift wood.  However, they are known to quarrel with con-specifics and are best kept singly in a tank with other tankmates that are two large to be considered food.  Also avoid adding a common pleco, they don't mesh well with bichirs.
sjLRBnE7aa	I don't understand what's up with people putting fish in buckets every time they clean their aquariums.  In my opinion, if you have an established system, you can perform routine maintenance without having to take out any fish from your tank.  Here are some recommendations to diminish stress on fish while changing water or decorations:    1. Use "Stress Coat" (from Aquarium Pharmaceuticals) to replace natural slime coating on fish.  2. I always start on one side of the tank so that fish can move to the other side while I'm siphoning gravel and changing decorations.  After finishing the first half, then I continue cleaning the other half.  3. Remove decorations and move things around using aquarium tongs.  Avoid submerging your whole arm inside the tank unless you have a big aquarium.  Always use gloves.  4. Avoid extreme abrupt movements or tapping the glass since fish get stressed out with these interventions.  5. If you need to transfer your fish, always use soft mesh nets.  Avoid chasing fish with one net in order to catch them.  Use a very large net on one side and a smaller one on the other.  6. Long Handled Scrapers are ideal to clean algae on tank's internal surface without touching the water.    7. New water and old aquarium water should have similar temperatures to diminish shock.  If possible, prepare new water (including conditioners and additives) in a separate container at least 24 hours before starting to clean your tank.    I hope these suggestions helps you during your cleaning routine.|`|M3maZgdyaa	Fill a container with the water from your tank, transfer the fish to the container. drain the tank. Wipe it out very well without chemicals or soap. Refill the tank put in your chemicals and place the fish in a bag of the water from the first tank and set it in the aquarium until they adjust to the temp. then put them in the fresh/clean water,they should be ok.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	get a big bucket and fill it with not to hot / cold water    i have fish they stay alive|`|NWwGl4k6aa	just whisper sweet nothings in their little fish ears as you change it.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	The gravel has a lot of beneficial bacteria in it if it has been in there for a while.  If you remove all the it and put new gravel in, your tank will go through a big cycle.  The way to minimize it is to leave all the water in and remove only the gravel and ornaments, don't touch the filter.  Let the tank sit for a week, then add the new gravel and ornaments.  Wait another week, and then do a regular water change.  If you fish are healthy, they should do ok.    Cheers|`|m0e3a3gWaa	What you need to do is protect your biological bacteria.   By changing your gravel you will be getting rid of allot of this.    The fish you can just put into buckets.  Your filter media which houses most of the biological bacteria you want to also put in a bucket, with the tank water.  If you have one put an air stone in there for oxygen.    Have all your gravel and decorations ready and to go and do the change as quick as possible.    Once the tank is filled back up let it run about 45 minutes before putting the fish back.    keep an eye on your ammonia and nitrite levels and feed your fish every other day for a few weeks.    edit: torres...great answer, wrong question!|`|HBUO10i7aa	YOU NEED TO SIT THEM DOWN AND EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE TERMS THAT IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT THAT THIS IS HAPPENING....THAT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, AND WHEN IT'S OVER THEY'LL FIND OUT THAT IT REALLY WASN'T AS BAD AS THEY MIGHT HAVE ONCE THOUGHT, AND EVENTUALLY LEARN TO NOT JUST GET USED TO THE NEW ENVIRONMENT BUT EMBRACE IT!|`|AA10645224	PUT EM IN A BUCKET FILLED WITH WATER FROM THE TANK,    SAVE AS MUCH OF THE TANK WATER AS YOU CAN    YOUR FISH ARE ALREADY UPSET BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A GLASS CAGE    DO YOUR REDECORATING THEN PUT THE FISH AND WATER BACK IN    USE WARM WATER TO FINISH FILLING TANK|`|mXecXR06aa	you can put same water of the old one into something and put the fisn in and then change the aquarium and put in it whatever you want

Those birds need out of the cage time with you or they will be unhappy and will pluck their feathers out.  The only two options that you have is either a Finch or Canary.  Both are pretty birds and they both come in a range of colors.  You will need to get a good size cage sense they won't be coming out of it.  Plus you will have to at least get two birds so they can socialize with each other.  Petsmart and Petco have many different Finches and Canarys.|`|M9KUiTOAaa	A canary! They come in lots of colors like yellow, red, orange, and variegated. They are sweet little birds. They are fine if you have only one. Males are the singers. And boy do they sing! Mine cheeps and I cheep back and he does it again and I do it back, this goes on for a while until he breaks out into a song and then I can't keep up! They love to hear you talk to them. They are fun to watch. I let mine out to fly around my room. (only after I turn off the ceiling fans and cover the mirrors and windows of course.) I would totally recommend a canary to anyone wanting a bird that doesn't want a hands on bird. They have great little personalities. And did I mention their song? WOW! What a delight that is. They sing up a storm! And it is so pretty when they sing!|`|614tYbzxaa	canary is the best as they dont like being handled and males only are the ones that sing but this stops when they begin to moult.|`|nHW3tw07aa	i would go with canary|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Can't beat a budgie.

They are a small type of parrot and very funt o watch. They are fine staying in their cages (just make sure they have enough room)    Budgie's are also cheap and there's lots of toys you can buy for them. (at my local pet stores non-hand tamed ones sell between 17-20 dollars each.)        Some one said Cockatiel.. they are great but need to be played with and are much more expensive plus take up more space.    Canarys are cool, ive never owned any but at the stores and breeders etc. they make LOVELY sounds and come in lots of beautiful colors.  Finches are nice aswell.       If your a first time bird owner i would get a Budgie/budgies.  some budgie's that ive owned love to put on a show, one would go to the top of the cage to one of the corners and do flips under her legs.   It was very entertaining to watch, she was our acrobat :P       Hope This Helps.. And Good Luck with what ever you choose.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Good for you for getting two! You won't regret it, you'll love seeing them interact with each other.  If you are not interested in having hand-tame birds, I would probably stay away from Cockatiels. I have two Budgies, one is hand-tame and the other usually prefers not to socialize with me, but they are really great little energetic birds. I don't have any experience with finches, but hopefully someone with more knowledge on them will post for you.    Good luck.

KeevlZnTaa	"do they bite when not provoked or being played with"  --Most ferrets(especially young), will engage in nipping behavior. Ferrets have very thick skin and one of the ways they play with each other is through nipping and biting(which is why it is a good idea to keep two together).     For most ferrets, you are not going to be able to stop nipping altogether(it just how they play), but you can keep it to a minimum and make it not too hard. I have 4 ferrets, which have been nipped trained, and while they still nip, it is not too frequent(mostly when they want my attention), or if I wrestle with them.    NIP TRAINING  Ferrets must be nip trained when they are young, or if they are adults, the rules needs to be set as soon as you get them in the home. There are correct and incorrect ways to do this. Hitting, yelling, flicking the nose, do not work and may lead to an aggressive and hand shy ferret.     When ever a ferret nips at you, you need to say "no", pick them up by the scruff of the neck(it does not hurt them), and light drag them across the floor(about a foot). This is something that would be done to them by the mother.     "what are bad things to feed them"  -- Ferrets are obligate carnivores and therefore they should not be fed fruits, vegetables, grains, etc. They eat meat and need a diet that reflects their needs. They should also not live on cat food, as it is not nutritionally adequate.    They should have at least three high quality food mixed together (ferrets are very picky eaters and if the store stops selling one of your foods, you still have two others). Marshals food is not a high quality food(do not feed the ferret this). High quality means first three ingredients meat, and no fish.34-36% protein and approximately 20% fat (and low fiber) The high quality food can cost anywhere from 15 dollars to over 20 for a 5 -10 lb bag. Feeding them low quality food may be cheaper for awhile, but will lead to health problems and costly vet bills later.    Although some people choose not to, it is a good idea to get them used to something called duck soup. It is a good diet for a sick ferret, and many ferrets will not eat it if they are not used to it. The last thing you want to do while your ferret is ill, is try to force feed it. You may also want to introduce something called nuti-cal(another high cal supplement for ill ferrets). These are things that you can feed once a month or every other month, just to be sure your ferret will eat it. When my ferret was ill and started loosing a lot of weight, duck soup probably saved his life. Ferrets have a fast metabolism and if they do not eat, they loose weight very quickly.    "and if they will get along with a docson/short haired terrier and mini collie who like to kill ground moles"  --This is going to depend on the dog. You know your dogs best, so only you can answer this. Remember that ferrets play bite and they have sharp little teeth. While the bite is not going to break skin(most likely), it will be painful. Can you trust your dogs not to bite back. It only takes one time for a tragic accident to happen. I have a small westie, and would never trust my ferrets with her. If you know that your dog kills small animals, then it is not a good idea to put them together. There are times when a dogs instincts kick in and he could kill the ferret accidentally(even if they have previously gotten along).    "and one more thing how do i clip there nails would it be bad to use pedding paws? nail clippers?"  -- I find it easier to use a nail clipper. They sell clippers for cats that are small and delicate enough to cut their nails. When I want to cut my ferrets nails I enlist the help of someone. The easiest way is to have someone scruff the neck and hold them in the air, like a puppy/kitten. Scruffing them puts them into a sort of sleep and keeps them still(you'll see them yawning and the eyes close a bit). You can then easily cut the nails. Watch for the quick(red vein inside of the nail), if you cut the quick it will bleed. If you do accidentally cut the quick do not panic, put flour(or buy styptic powder) , and liberally put it on the end of the nail.|`|r91SnpGAaa	I have ferrets and a dog. First, Get them to meet but you may have to keep them seperate.    Ferrets love to play and will entertain you for hours, Bite. Depends if they have been handled alot then no, But if they havent they sure will and they hurt, Another thing is ours have a thing for feet.    They have ferret food, but if you cant get that they are happy with the dry cat biscuits. Also cat milk, But thats a extra treat.    Bad things, Ummm... nothing is really bad i dont think, They love uncooked eggs they like to play with it before smashing it.    They love tubes and plastic bags, anything that really makes a noise.    Make sure they have lots of water and get there nails cut whenever.    If you have anymore questions im on yahoo; Thanosjones|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	Yes, when you get your ferret, it will bite you when you're playing, but simply because biting is how ferrets play! When they bite, scruff them, and hiss at them, and eventually they'll learn not to bite.     Ferrets cannot eat anything that isn't meat-based! The only exceptions are pure pumpkin for lax, and the occasional banana treat/ baby food for the sick ferret. Anything else, including the loved raisins and Cheerios, are very bad for ferrets. If your ferret likes meat, then by all means give them as much as they want! Some good ferret kibbles are Evo, Zupreem, and Totally Ferret. Marshalls is NOT a good food- even if your ferret is being fed it, switch their food. Some good treats are Ferretone ( very little), Foamy Fries, N-Bones, Cheweasels, Pogos, Wysong Daily Dream Treats, Kitten Replacement Milk, and Plain Eggs (they can be raw (no yolk), boiled, scrambled, you name it as long as it's plain)    It depends on your dogs. If the dogs themselves like to kill moles, then I would be very careful with the dogs around your ferret. Hold your ferret and have someone else hold your dog, and let them sniff each other and see how the dog reacts to the ferret, and let that determine whether you want them to be together.    I personally have never used any kind of nail clipper other than plain pet nail clippers, and I wouldn't use Pedi-paws or anything like that. Ferret nails are very tiny, and I would be afraid that those clippers would go too far and grind the quick. You can use plain cat nail clippers, or baby nail clippers as long as the blades are new and sharp.|`|GTmkQzCgaa	You can use regualr people nail clippers to clip a ferret's nails. you might just be able to get one paw at a time on the front, but when you go to do the back, put a bit of a treat on their belly, and they'll 'bend over' to get at it, letting you get the back ones. If it 'runs out', and you're not done, just put a bit more on their belly so you can finish

I had a betta once that would only eat the blood worms, no matter how hard I tried and what betta foods I used, he wouldn't eat anything else.  So I let him eat the blood worms.  He didn't live for 6 months.  His scales got spotty white stuff on it.  Which I think is the parasites from the worms. So I guess that's my answer and my personal story.  feed the blood worms, but try every now and again to get him to eat the betta food.|`|QV6swGUMaa	try flake food and ya should increase have a look at this page here.hope it helps good luck.http://www.thetropicaltank.co.uk/Fishind...|`|hCvEbRYWaa	mine won't eat the flakes and he won't eat the little pellets of food either. so what I do is crush up 4 or 5 pellets of food and drop it in.

AA12384954	Thank you, you gave me my best laugh today.  She is just having fun, most probably a young pup and this is the game she has devised in getting you to play with you.  Pups and young dogs often play this game on their owners.  She sounds like she needs some simple basic training.  Best thing to do is call her to you and reward her with a little treat when she does.  When she is obedient with that progress to the fetch and little rewards; even a pat and a fuss should suffice really.  Eventually you should be able to get her to return everything, but it will take effort on your part.  It would be best to provide her with lots of her own toys too, that she can do with as she wishes, but she needs to learn what is not appropriate to touch.  That's the hard bit, lots of firm nos.  Even still, my old red heeler was a cleptomaniac to the end, although not so often as he aged, which was very embarassing I can assure you.  Still where would we be without them.    Ps. He was a very well-trained dog too.  I took him to puppy training at a young age, and although we were not classy he was a very sociable dog, albeit the occasional cleptomania.

Also the "leave it" command is useful....put treats on the floor and have your dog on leash...walk around the treat...right away he will want to get there, hold on to the leash and said leave it....the moment he stops pulling, give him a higher value treat than the ones on the ground...|`|7DMFT0staa	It sounds like your puppy is trying to make a game of some sort. Why dont u try  to find his/her favorite toy  and play tug of war with it. Do this as often as you can 3 or 4 times a day, or for a half hour/hour at a time. This might eliminate the mess your dog is making. If that doesnt work, find other kinds of games to play with the dog. It sounds like he/she needs attention and that probably why he/she makes such a mess!

Good Luck!|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Sure, why not.  The dobies I've gotten to know have been very dog-friendly because they've been from good breeders and then well-socialized.      And while dobies are an active breed, it sounds like you're making plans for that - getting a dog walker in is essential, especially for a puppy you're training.  Don't forget the socializing and obedience training as well!|`|vPde97E2aa	NOT breed specific!

t4x3tr3Qaa	the  previous  answer  of  breeding net  is  a  good one  and  explains  the  sometimes  dead  fry  well.. but  the  single  fry  each time    is  your  question I think...  ok.. there  are  a  couple things  going on here..  First  be  aware that " balloon"  anything  is  a spinal  curvature  that is being  bred  for..  it is  not  healthy  or  natural...  I am not  sure  of  the  exact  anatomical result of  the  balloon  curvature  so it is  possible  that that  the  space left   for  the  actual  development  chamber  is  somewhat  cramped-- 1  baby.  it is  also  possible  that  she  is  less than  highly fertile or  that  some of  the offspring  die  during development ( possibly due  to  an over  extreme  curvature of the  spine) and  are  reabsorbed  by the females  body...|`|AHEFXgE7aa	She probably gets stressed out in the breeding trap.  Try a breeding net instead.  It's more natural for her.    Cheers

AA12083992	The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck  three websites on how to crate train a puppy    http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info...          http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....       http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_c...|`|9VqUC9Haaa	First things first.... do you have a crate??? if you don't buy one..... crate training iss the MOST important part of poddy training....     heres how it works.... the dog stays in its crate ALL day, coming out every 4 hours... the first thing it does when it comes out, is GO OUTSIDE... after a couple weeks, your dog should be trained....    If this method fails,    give your dog a designated spot outside where it go's poddy, put one of those puppy training mats( can buy them at your local pet store... used for poddy training) on top of the spot where it went, and every time it go's outside, thats where it is to pee.... when it go's back in the house, to the crate it go's..    this gives your puppy NO chance for freedom in the house, therefore,not allowing it to go in the house... ( this method also works for  2, not just  1)     be sure to ALWAYS reward your pet with a treat and much praise, as this will encourafe it to do it again, for the simple fact that your dog wants to please you.... I hope I helped out!|`|DIkfJ4DRaa	yah me 2 my shi-tzu and i having prob 2 like that but u can in youtube bcuz there''s so many how to train a shi tzu right there ^^|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	You have done nothing wrong.

LOH6UVh7aa	Here is a site that will help with the color of the foal. A color calculator.      http://www.horsetesting.com/CCalculator1...|`|FLBCvJuDaa	I bred a bay mare with a black stallion.  The foal came out- picture this- head to girth black and white paint, girth to tail brown and white appaloosa, one brown eye, one blue eye.  So, you just never know.|`|c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	There are too many unknowns to give you a real accurate guess since you have all the common base colors in the backgrounds of these horses.  The only way to get a good guess would be to have the stud and mare both tested for certain genes that can't be seen or guessed at.  Your mare is carrying at least one aguoti gene, but is she carrying one or two?  Is she carring a red gene?  You can't be sure of either of these things on the mare so you have to use "unknown" in a calculation.  You can't tell if the stud you've bred to is carrying the agouti gene without testing as he's only carrying red genes, no black.  The agouti gene restricts black to the points.  If a horse gets an agouti gene it will not be black all over, it will be bay.  So you're throwing another "unknown" in there.        The stud you bred to is only carrying one tobiano gene, so you have a 50% chance of getting the tobiano (he may have produced 80% tobiano foals but with each foal there comes a new 50% chance.  It's always a roll of the dice with each foal, so you do not have an 80% chance because that's what he's thrown so far).  You know the stud is going to throw a red gene.  Red is the most recessive gene there is, so a chestnut (or sorrel) horse is always carrying two red genes so will always throw one red gene.    The mare is anybody's guess.  She is carrying black, but if the foal gets an agouti gene from either her or the stud the foal will not be black all over.  You know the mare is carrying at least one, so right there the foal has a 50% chance of getting one from her (if not a higher % since the stud could also be carrying one or two and the mare could be carrying two rather than only one).  That's why you will see below that the chances for a black or black tobiano are pretty slim, because more than likey the foal will end up with an agouti gene.  Her grandsire is chestnut so she has a chance of carrying a red gene, but again, we woudn't know unless she was tested.  OR if she throws a chestnut foal from this cross, you know (for future reference) she IS carrying a red gene as the only way for you to get a chestnut foal is to get a red gene from both her and the sire (you already know he's going to throw red and to be chestnut the foal would also have to get a red gene from the mare).      Like I said, too many "unknowns" to get an accurate calculation, but here it is with those unknowns:    37.50% Chestnut Tobiano  32.81% Bay Tobiano  12.50% Chestnut   10.94% Bay  4.69% Black Tobiano  1.56% Black|`|Q1U8hP1Xaa	It's pretty hard to tell;you might get a bay..maybe Dun tobiano(Or tovero,etc.),or something close to that. But like the previous answerer said..you never really know!! Good Luck!|`|px27V5N9aa	I also love the color calculator.      Offspring Color Probability    43.75% -   Bay Tobiano  25.00% -   Chestnut Tobiano  14.58% -   Bay  8.33% -   Chestnut  6.25% -   Black Tobiano  2.08% -   Black|`|CgEjK7NGaa	Based on my experience, I would guess chestnut or chestnut tobiano.  BUT....you really never know.  It may be a totally unexpected color.      That's part of why foals are fun to wait for...the "color guessing game"! :)    Congrats on the new addition!|`|ndqjst7taa	Your foal will problably still be a bay but a lighter brown almost a chesnet colour.|`|94d7ab1dc0cbf0c83da720b731b0f8a2aa	well here are your possibilities...  a bay has a at least one black gene and one agouti gene... so the mare can pass a black, a red (possibly), or an agouti gene.    the stud can pass only red (chestnuts have two red genes) and no agouti. he has a 50/50 chance of passing the paint gene since he's an 80% color producer that means he's NOT homozygous.    sooo... your foal can be bay, chestnut, black (all solid colors), or any of those colors plus the pinto coloring,,, so bay and white, chestnut and white, and black and white.    most likely your foal will be a chestnut based (red) pinto, or have a lot of white|`|f1fecfb9df2a21a73ebc82aa0ba49ad0aa	Well typically you will get a chestnut or a bay because bay is the "default" colour. and you will only get a chestnut if your mare is carrying the chestnut gene as a recessive trait. You have a small chance of getting a black foal as well, depending on exactly what genes your mare carries. The chances of you getting a patterned foal are about 50 - 90%. If the stallion is homozygous for the tobiano pattern you will be guarenteed to get a patterned foal, but because he only throws pattern 80% of the time, it sounds like you have a 1 in 4 chance of getting a pattern (based on simple genetics).

We had spent a fortune trying to make him better. He lived one year. We feel guilty for ever getting mad that he couldn't do some things no matter how much we trained him or for disciplining him.

We think of him everyday but we have new dogs now that we charish a whole lot more and realize what a gift they are to us.

2Go0Y0xnaa	It's very possible your rats have mites.  Mites start out with little tiny red scratch like marks, and when it turns into a secondary infection, the skin and tail can turn yellow.  Mites are miserable.  They bite and bite and are just a pain to get rid of.      You'll definitely need to see a vet to get some Revolution (topical and hopefully a one time treatment) or some Ivermectim (oral for 4 weeks, then once a month) to treat the mites, and you may very well need some oral antibiotics to treat the secondary infection.  I personally prefer the oral Ivermectin liquid as I have had some bad reactions to the Revolution.      Make sure you completely clean and sterilize their cage, washing all hammocks, huts, etc.  If you use wood products, either throw them out or sterilize them by soaking them in hot bleach water and then baking in the oven at 250 degrees until dry.

Um8osMNuaa	lt's normal for dogs to sneeze when they wake up, when they are in a dusty atmosphere, when exercising on dry ground or when near aerosols and any spray such as perfume.  Sneezing can also indicate that something is lodged in the nostril, maybe a grass seed or something similar, signs are, bleeding from the nose, discomfort, shaking of the head, rubbing the nose or noisy breathing then the dog would need to see the vet.  Sneezing is also a sign of respiratory disease.  lf the sneezing is only occasional then l wouldn't worry, but if it is prolonged bouts of sneezing then l would see the vet.|`|ixIspjcRaa	why do people sneeze?|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Animals sneeze for all the same reasons people sneeze.....Could be to clear her nostrils, sometimes stomach gases make them sneeze.

They are very active and highly intelligent, they need to be kept busy.  They are not mean, although some people think they are because of the way they look. They are actually very trustworthy and loyal dogs, very protective of their owners.  They grow to around 21-22" and a weight of around 52-62lb.  They are white, brindle, tan and white and black, white and tan.  My Alfie is all white, with a few black spots on his ears. l crate trained him and he was house trained at about 4 months old, he did learn very quickly.      http://flickr.com/photos/millypeed/29182...

NCBDNMLXaa	You'll need a heater to warm the water and a chiller to cool it.    Heaters are cheap but chillers are very expensive...they're also big, noisy and they pump heat into the room they're sitting.    That said, unless you're running a coral reef tank, which I suspect is not the case here, you likely don't need a chiller.    On the off chance that you do need a chiller and are willing to spend the money, you'll also need a controller that switches the heater and the chiller on and off so you don't end up in a situation where both units are running at the same time.    But as I said, I don't think you need a chiller.    Marine Depot is a reasonable source for your needs, as they carry heaters from several manufacturers so you'll find something that meets your needs and budget.    http://www.marinedepot.com/    Good luck.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It's called a heater.

G3Xf0i0Eaa	Mine are really good. They sleep all day, maybe popping out for a snack or a quick run (half an hour), then go back to sleep.    In the evening, they'll come out when I enter the room to say hi, sometimes they'll then stay up and run around for ages while I'm on the computer, or if its too early (late afternoon) they'll go back to sleep.    After about 7pm, thats when I may get them out in their balls for a good run around the room while I'm in there (but don't leave them running for ages as they need water!).    They'll then go back to bed or potter around chewing and digging and running in their own home.    When I go to bed (10-11pm) they may be up - depends if I've got them up and out before hand. They're usually always in bed by the time I get up about 7am.    So, on average they'll be awake about 5hours max that I'm aware of, more than likely more during the middle of the night.    If you go over to them everytime you walk in the room, they'll start popping up more and more when you walk in, so its up to you how you treat them!|`|0JqF493Vaa	You bought dwarf hamsters with out doing research????|`|5TbtXdJXaa	it should wake about midnight and  like six hours later it should wake up|`|olIaHweOaa	Hi  Drawf hamsters are very lazy animals.

FJHU9PbUaa	Somtimes it depends on the hunting style of the breed. For instance an English Pointer will point, & use the tail as a beacon standing straight out, but it will usualy not retreive the fallen bird, & is more laid back.  German SHorthaired Pointers, who point & retreive, are docked to 2/5th because they swing their tails in a circluar fashion when they are on the scent & will dive into any brush, forest etc to retreive with great gusto. As they have short hair, & swing the tail so much, it is at high risk for injury & tails are notorious for slow healing. Likewise the Weim who has a long thin unprotected tail. In comparasion the Labradors long tail is well protected with thick fur & the tail itself is very thick & he uses the tail while swimming. Other upland hunting dog like setters have long hair to help protect the tail. It is alot easier on a 3day old puppy to dock a tail than a 2yr old hunting dog who has smashed his tail to a bloody pulp against a tree.     Chaos   - Pointers do not have their tails against their body, they swing them in circles & point with them extended.(pointing)|`|vEv2YwWdaa	There has been no need to "dock" a dogs tails since the early 1900's.  People do it now for looks, it is not necessary.  You risk infection and pain for the dog.  Anything feels pain when it is cut into.  Dogs are the same.  it is needless pain.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	The pointers tail is stronger and thicker then the weimaraners tail. And pointers usually leave their tails close to their bodies till when they point. Weimaraners have an erect tail usually unless they are upset. Weimaraners point with their legs instead of their tails. Weimaraners are used for thick brush areas usually cause they have a better nose, pointers are open field dogs.    Lots of working dogs have happy tails which can cause serious damage not only to themselves but their owners.     Same with the aussies they dont have as strong tail as the cattle dogs, but still cattle dogs are sometimes docked.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I'm guessing it would have a lot to do with the environment the dog is working in (thick cover vs open field), the style of working (intense vs laid back), and the structure of the tail (some tails being sturdier or better protected than others).|`|jYy6dDAZaa	It's for us, did you ever stand next to a happy Doberman? Their tails are like whips.|`|9VqUC9Haaa	It is better for the tail to be docked, so that farming accidents do not acure... also the eenvironment.. you don't want their tails to get caught in something.    I know tail docking seems cruel, and i prefer they not do it, but they dock it when they are so young(like when they are first born) so  they can't feel it.... thays why they do it when they are so young....I used to hate it when i was younger..|`|vPde97E2aa	Different areas,different styles,different QUARRY,different coats,different PERSONAL PREFERENCE.

"Similar" does NOT equal "identical".|`|d6HXwlpPaa	Hi American Girl AKA Raised on Promises,    I often wondered the reason for the docked tail on my own dog. I was told by a breeder and an AKC judge that docked tails can no longer be part of a breed standard when showing and judging, so soon it will be just an aesthetic choice for most. My dog breed is the Boykin Spaniel which is an american water spaniel from South Carolina, it is the state dog. Boykins are gun dogs and are flushers retrievers etc, they were prized for their compact size and strength, the hunters would take them duck and turkey hunting. I was told the tail was docked because they could grow long on such a short legged dog but I also notice when my dog is retrieving or playing frisbee, her tail never stops its full circle wag of excitement, if the tail were longer she would definitely be hurting herself. Here is an article about Boykins with a picture. Great question!  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Yup, I think Basset nailed it.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Actually some Pointers are docked as well.  Many working and sporting dogs have tails docked either because they have thin/long tails that can be easily damaged or because they have old school owners that think the only way to show them is to have them docked or because they injured their tail prior to docking and it had to be docked to prevent further injury.    Most breeds now are not required to dock for showing.  However, if a dog is a shower AND worker the owners may dock the tail so it doesn't end up damaged.

Good quality, reputable and ethical breeders that care about their puppies will usually ask you:    Will the puppy be inside or outside?  If outside, how much time can you spend with it and what kind of shelter do you have?  Do you have a fenced in yard?  Do you plan on keeping vaccinations utd?  Heartworm meds?  Will you train your pup yourself or professionally?  What kind of food will you give?  Will it be a pet or will you do agility/work?    Are you married?  Do you rent or own your home?  Do you have kids/other animals?    There are numerous questions you could be asked.  Good breeders will always sell their pups on limited registration unless they are co-owning the pup while it is getting its show champion title/OFA certs & approved mate is found (then ownership will be turned over fully to the new owner).    Good breeders want to make sure their pups go to forever homes.  Homes that are prepared to have a dog for up to 15 years and know what they are getting into with the breed they've chosen.  They let you know that they are available any time you need them and that if you can't keep the puppy you are to bring it back to them.  They'll offer health guarantees, make sure you understand everything, give you shot records/pedigree info/registration application/food sample/possibly toys/leash/collar/bowl as well.|`|s9haCi64aa	It depends on the breeder, a good breeder will ask you questions before even showing you the puppies. If they dont ask questions steer clear of that breeder. They will ask you about your lifestyle, house, garden, work hours,  if you intend on doing any type of classes with the dog, showing the dog, male or female preferred, colour, why you want to go with that breed, your experience with dogs.

They are very old fish; they are one of the oldest. They are long lived so they really do get to know you when you get to know them. They have very distinct personalities.They are friendly and have interestingly enough different colors. Some are friendlier than others.First there are the ones that are more naturally colored and naturally body shaped. But they will follow you around. They do hear a lot. They can hear through the water. They will come to recognize faces. They really then come to recognize different walks of people. That's one reason you can sit on a pond and they come to you.  It is important to keep an eye on the health of the Koi. You have to look to see if they are getting sick from possible bacterial infections. All the disease source will be on the under belly, so it is important to look for that. They are expensive fish, because they need care. But that also makes them friendlier. You can pet them. They will come up to have their heads stroked if you teach them to feed out of your hands. They will suck on your fingers.  Because Koy live a long time it really is our responsibility to take good care of them. They really do become a family pet. They don't tell you when they are not feeling good. They don't wine. They don't start chewing on furniture. It is important to learn their personalities.    here is a picture of one :]  http://www.koipondcentral.com/articles/i...|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Koi get 3ft long, don't know quite what Jessica is smoking over there...

Pm8nsCGZaa	Speaking for AQHA , FQHR  shows, a bosal or ring snaffle may be used on any horse up to the age of 6. When they are 6 years old, they have to have a shank bit.  This shank bit can be broken mouth or curb, but must have shanks and be ridden one handed. Under the age of 6 your horse may be ridden with a ring snaffle or bosal and be ridden two handed. Any age horse may be ridden with a shank bit ie: good broke 4 year old for example.  English classes are different, they all ride 2 handed, no matter the age, its just the discipline of riding english.  Western considers horses under 6 to be "junior" or still in training mode, so they allow snaffles, until it they reach the age where they should know what they are doing and can be ridden with neck rein pressure,and not be guided by mouth pressure,  hence single handed, shank bit  riding.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	You already have good answers, but I just have a comment.  In western, classes that allow a snaffle bit, they have to also allow the use of two two handed reining.  Because in western horsemanship the snaffle is considered a training bit, and is designed to be used with one rein engaged at a time, it is not considered the appropriate bit for one handed neck reining.  Classes allowing the snaffle bit are considered to be training level.  A leverage bit is designed to be used with both reins engaged simultaneously, and on a looser rein, and is the appropriate bit for a finished, neck reined horse largely for that reason.  In English riding, the curb is combined with the snaffle, either by virtue of a pelham or the double bridle, and contact is maintained through the snaffle reins, while the curb is only engaged as needed for elevation and positioning. Many pursuits in English horsemanship don't require the curb bit function, and can be performed with the direct contact a snaffle allows.  Add....The pelham is not not legal in the dressage showring, but may be used in training before the double bridle is introduced.|`|AA10986942	Sorry Barrel babe but in AQHA the age for a snaffle bit is 5 and under.  You can show in any western class using 2 hands as long as you have a snaffle bit (smooth mouth piece only no twisted wire bits) or bosal and your horse is 5 or under.  This also goes for smaller local shows.   There are also alot of bits that are considered illegal for use with AQHA..  That is why before going in the ring at many AQHA shows including congress they have a judge that does a bit check before you go into the ring or after the class is over and you are lined up in the middle the judges will ask you to dismount one at a time and drop your horses bit to make sure you are not showing in something that is not allowed.   Since there are so many different bits it is best to get onto the AQHA web site and request a rule book and you can look up rules on bits.|`|IAiZTdIhaa	The reason direct bits can be used in English rather than Western is because in many cases the English horses are more high-strung than Western horses. Also, due to the fact that English classes include jumping and dressage, the riders need more control.|`|5TCewPYRaa	Under 4 years of age you can use a direct bit, such as a snaffle or even a bosal if you wish    Over 4 years of age, you must use a shank bit.     The headset required by western classes like pleasure and trail does not allow for you to have direct contact with the horses mouth--cues must be subtle and given with loose rein and a low headset.       However you are correct in telling them to talk to their judge--or at least look at the association rules, every division is different, they all require different things but there are some general guidelines such as no mechanical hackamores, no bosals (most of the time over 4), most require a shank bit, no direct contact--loose rein.       Good Luck with your research...hope I could help  BB|`|7cm4dZVaaa	You are on the right track.  Each governing body has slightly differnet rules about legal bits, so must be checked.  In general 4 (or 5 in some circles) year olds and younger may be shown in snaffle or bosal, older horses must be shown in a curbed bit.  It is also a training issue, like when you go up the levels in dressage, higher levels require a full bridle, and disallow a snaffle only.  A senior horse is supposed to be ready for a curbed bit.

AA12083992	You have to be outside with her to let her know she did the right thing when she goes outside. The first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. A rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. When your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! Take the pup out. When the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. After exercise (play), take the pup out. When the pup does it's thing outside praise it. A lot. Tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  You have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. When you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. If you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. If you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "I should have been paying more attention." Daytime training they get pretty fast. Night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. Also remember the one hour/one month rule. You will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. Good luck|`|e71MWgJJaa	like dogs that are mostly inside they have grown to like the indoors like their home. they know that outside is their peeing spot. for your dog he got to know the outdoors better than the indoors so maybe he thinks that inside is his peeing spot.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	I would have to say if the animal is out side for great periods of time they are not able to distinguish or relate going out for the purpose of going to use the bathroom. Keep them inside for the majority of the time and taking them out to use the bathroom and as soon as they have done  so, bring them back in. Consistancy is always the key.|`|kqnaqakLaa	they have a spray you use on just about any flooring that makes  the pup not want to pee or poop where the smell is. and pups   will get excited and pee, but usually this behavior is sparked from  the owner. have you tried training pads, too?|`|AbtCfY1caa	that is a dominance issue, the puppy is trying to claim the house as its own.  make sure you train it to be submissive outside (by giving it attention and discipline) once the pecking order is firmly established there it will take only a few times of disciplining it inside to stop the issue.  yes rub its nose in it and then take it to the proper place and praise it.|`|IYnxKUH7aa	the only thing you can do is when she starts to pee pick her up and take her outside so she knows where she is supposed to be, then firmly tell her off so she knows that inside is wrong.....i did it with my dog it worked|`|YvNMUnR6aa	some dogs just can't be house trained. but every hour take her outside and stay outside until she goes potty. if its warm outside im sure the dog would go potty too just be patient and it will be ok|`|v0BgYIHcaa	have u tried the puppy pads?|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	WEll, first, don't let her inside untill you know for sure, like you see her, pee. take her out on a leash when she wants to go out, and stand there untill she goes. then when you bring her in, always watch her unless she's in her crate, if you decide to crate train her, witch is a really good idea. confine her to a certain, non carpited area while she's inside. eventually this should help. don't let her roam free until she's trained or she will never get rid of this problem.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Ok, I really suggest crate training. This works because until its trained to go out you keep it in a crate. Since the don't like going to the bathroom where they sleep, the dog will hold it it. Finally when you wait and it seems the dog must go outside ( its usually when dogs wake up themselves because they need to "go") then take it out and it should go. They don't like go where they sleep because they don't like to lay in it. So keep it in the crate take it out. Put it in the crate immediately. Soon the dog will get the message and go. When your dog is trained to go outside let it out of the crate|`|9VqUC9Haaa	YES crate train your dog..... do NOT let her roam about the house. This is part of your problem, by giving her this much freedom, she will pee like this.... i have found that if you train your dog to ring a bell that is hung on the door, this is an effective way of trianing. you can buy a bell at the pet store, hang it on the door, and train her to ring it whenever she needs to go out.. AFTER YOU HAVE CRATE TRAINED HER!!!!! I hope I have helped...
3n60UxgQaa	It's probably just his coloring.    Fish are prone to change colors as they mature, especially bettas since they have such a wide range of colors.  He probably has a gene for the bluish white but it just took a while to show up.  If he's moving about and acting normal, eating normal, etc. he's fine.    If not, there's probably something wrong with him, an infection or something.    However, from what you described, it doesn't sound that way. =]|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	That is 100% normal for bettas.  The bluish-white color is due to guanine, which is a natural pigment found in most fish's skins, fins, and scales.|`|OsVswissaa	A lot of red bettas have the same thing.  It's probably part of his colouring, I've seen that all the time.  Just keep and eye on it if you're concerned.  Fin loss/rot would be red or black, or the fins would just disappear.  Those are ventral fins  the one of the side, like little fishie arms are pectoral fins.
HpPR2MUNaa	Smart Dude,    I see this problem a lot, and oftentimes it is just because the snake does not like the color of the Rat. Some snakes will only eat predominantly "white" prey items. Weird huh?    There is no real benefit to feeding One large rat over feeding Two Smaller Adult mice.    The bottom line is that if your Carpet Python is happy eating the mice, don't try to fix it.    I do understand that it will cost you around 1.5x more buying the additional mouse instead of just one rat, but it may be the best option.    I hope everything works out.    Have a nice day!    To the Below Poster:    With all due respect the nutritional content is almost negligible in terms of a carpet pythons GI tract and the way their body functions.    I do not deny that on paper rats are more nutritious. I am just stating that sometimes we do not have a choice of rats or mice.    Sometimes there are those picky eaters that will only eat rats, or those that will only eat mice.    As long as the owner is not power feeding their animals to reach breeding age, the nutritional content difference between mice and rats is almost trivial.    I've had great results on both mice and rats. Sorry if there was any misunderstanding.|`|44gTtORXaa	Use a "primer", feed it a mouse and as soon as it finishes, feed it the rat.    Dip it in tuna, for some reason this helps most snakes eat.  Split the brain casing.  Kinda gross, but it definitely helps.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	First off, Garret F is wrong, there is benefit to feeding rats instead of mice. Rats have better nutritional value, less fat, more bone and muscle.   This may sound gross, but I know someone who had to actually pelt the mouse and put it on the rat... But it did work. Other wise you could try braining the rat. That can work sometimes.|`|k2l20XdFaa	You could try to rub the rat in tuna the first few times and see if the stronger scent will get him to take it. Other than that just wait until he gets a little larger. I have this issue with my ball python but i feed him live still. Too it maybe just that time of year, its pretty common. I hope this helps and good luck.|`|GPV0YRPpaa	hi you could and this has worked for me 80% let it smell the mouse if its on frozen then get ur prongs and offer it but not to close so he grabs it as soon as he looks intrested swap the mouse with the rat plus rub the mouse on the rat and hoplfuly he will take it and just keep doing it for a few times then see if he will take one stright away if not keep repeating with the mouse
P2yRAWiJaa	Dogs aren't on an exact 6 month cycle.  Technically your boxer could have an early heat because your put is in heat.     Our Lab was 9 months old before she had her first heat cycle and hers started when she got around another female Lab that came into heat.    Just make sure your girls aren't around a male when both (or even one) is in heat.  They get along fine with no men around but can become very upset and aggressive when there are.|`|ltP1gO4taa	I know that the cycles of human women who live or work together will synchronize, so it stands to reason that the same is true for dogs.

nQdGGBN4aa	Our experience (with 24 cats over the past 30) years is that the majority of cats will develop diarrhea drinking cows milk.    There is product named Cat Sip which is cows milk which has been treated to make it palatable for cats.    We give this to our cats once and a while and they have no problems digesting it.    Whether the amount of milk you gave to your kitten will cause diarrhea can only be answered by observing her.    In general, regardless of the old wife's tale of giving milk to a cat, most cats will develop diarrhea.    Now, having said all of that, there are cats who tolerate it.    And it is perhaps possible for a cat to adjust to cows milk - I've seen farm situations where milk is put out for the "barn" cats and they seem to tolerate it.    Perhaps it is simply that some of the cats tolerate and the other just don't drink it.    If you want to give your kitten milk, do so slowly and if she develops diarrhea just stop giving her any.    Cats don't need milk and there's no good reason to give them some.    If you kitten is one of the few who can tolerate it, give her some. But be sure you monitor so that she does not develop diarrhea.    If she has diarrhea, don't give her any more.    Diarrhea can cause dehydration which can cause other problems.|`|cl0cgYbQaa	you can onely give cat milk to a cat not cow milk it isnt good for then you can find cat milk anywere|`|oDY9XqSoaa	Maybe but even if it doesnt its still not good to give cats cows milk they can not digest it correctly|`|Amkmles0aa	yes cows milk is just for cows|`|IGY2ofRBaa	i dont think the odd little bit of milk will harm your kitten though it is not reccomended, cats stomachs can not tolerate cows milk and even the proper cat milk ive heard can be bad for them too, its probably best to just stick to water though my cats refuse to drink it from a bowl they like it from a dripping tap . she could possibly get the runs or then again she may not, depends on each cat i think.|`|JLOz9rXNaa	prob not , but milk is not the best thing for kittys|`|oT71QN8Raa	Cows milk really isn't BAD for cats, it just bothers some cats tummies.  I had two cats growing up (still alive at 21 years old) that I gave a bowl of milk to every morning.  They were fine with it and my mom still does it.  The cats, like I said are 21 years old and still kickin' :)  Now, the kittens I have now cant have cows milk, because it does bother them.  So it purely depends on the cat.  Don't let people tell you that NO cats can have cows milk, because there is nothing in the milk that will kill the cat.  The worst it can do is give the cat the runs (something that you really should not allow to happen) :)|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	I don't think that a good idea. I gave some to my kitten and his tummy was hurting.

Also a good thing to do if you can, give her a long walk before you leave, in that way she will get tired and sleeps after.  Leave her toys for her to play, some chewing bones, otherwise she will take "revenge" with your stuff  Try to leave the house for 5 minutes and come back and give her a little treat, then do the same for 10 minutes, and then for 15 minutes, in that way she'll learn that you go out but you come back    Dogs sleeps for very long periods, so don't worry, probably when she gets used to your schedule she'll sleep all the time    Also, try to leave her in a room, don't leave her with the whole house for her, dogs can be very "creative" and she could chew anything, even electric cords! so you have to be careful.    And finally, just if you can, find her a sister. I did this with my dogs, I have one for six months and he was barking and chewing the entire day, so I decided to get his brother home, and everything change since that day. There's no such a big difference to have one dog to have 2  dogs, the oldest one usually takes care of the youngest one, and they make companion to each other    Hope this could help, good luck!    PS: If this doesn't sound silly to you, talk to her, explain her that you need to go out but you'll come back. It amazing how much dogs can understand, some people say that some dogs can undestand as many words as a 3 year old kid, which is A LOT!|`|b3cfbbeb3bbfc593977384764590fdfeaa	Barking is a strong instinctive behavior in dogs. Some dogs start barking almost without thinking, so it's not realistic to try to teach a dog never to bark.     However, you can teach him to be quiet on command, or in certain situations. You can use the Remote Trainer to limit barking by training the dog to stop barking when he hears the word "Quiet!"    Source(s)  http://vur.me/wealth2u/sitstay

When they are out and about, try to put the scent of their urine and some of their droppings on a piece of newspaper or a tray lined with sawdust. They will instinctively have a designated 'potty' area in their cage so you need to encourage this outside their home too. Don't change the area or method, keep the paper in the same place and if they go anywhere else, move the droppings with a tissue onto the paper. Wipe up and spray with disinfectant any urine that isn't on the paper.  If they're on your lap there's not much you can do, so just put down a towel. Also let them have an opportunity to go in their potty area every 15 mins or so when you're holding them.    This should work as this is how I trained my guinea pigs, and any subsequent additions learned from the older ones.|`|PIv89Wecaa	That's just what they do...

Although Guinea pigs can be very scared creatures so maybe they get scared when you hold them. show them that your are a nice person or to them creature and maybe then they will stop weeing on ya. It also might be because they are young, they will probably stop in a while. hopefully!    good luck
OA7cPgGNaa	Sibe's can be wonderful family dogs. When raised properly, they can be great with children (though they do get large and could accidentally knock them down), can be good with cats (if the cats are dog savvy and know not to run), and can be loyal companions.    However...    Huskies are NOT for the average person. They need to be included in a pack, know their position in the pack (i.e. everyone in the household is ABOVE him/her in ranking order, period), and need plenty of mental and physical stimulation.    They need a tough leader and are always looking for ways to increase their "pecking" order. With this being said, EVERYBODY in the households needs to participate in the training. Your new pup may learn to come to you and your dad, but could completely ignore your mother if he/she thinks they are above them. This could be a life/death situation if the husky got out and your mother was the one home and was trying to get it to come back.     Huskies are notorious escape artists. They are like our modern day Houdini. They will look for ways to escape if left alone for long periods of time. I have had ones scale fences, dig under fenced, chew through their wire crate, get out of a closed-off room, etc. You can run them for miles and they will still be looking for something to do.    Training is a must and needs to be done early on, but even then they need training sessions every day to reinforce what they have learned (with everyone participating. I cannot stress this enough). They absolutely are NOT an "off leash" dog. They may come to you when you say "COME" in the yard or house, but take them to a dog park or even in your front yard and they will pretend to be deaf. They are extremely willful, hard headed, stubborn, and extremely independent. Often times they will think their judgment is better than yours and completely ignore your commands.    They are not good yard dogs. They can easily scale an 8 ft fence in a matter of seconds. They also love to dig (as to most dogs) so a sandbox is a must.    They also need to be socialized, socialized, trained, socialized, trained, and socialized some more. They need to meet 20+ different people and they need to get used to seeing cats/dogs outside of their own family (though even with this training they will still be tempted to go after and hunt down small prey like animals).    However...    they CAN be wonderful dogs **IF** you know how to handle them and can give them a job. They are definitely NOT for a first time dog owner, someone who works a crazy 10++ hour day, or cannot devote a good hour ++ for exercise. Not to mention another 45 mins a day when its time for them to "blow their coat" (which is a pain).    I love huskies and have trained and rehabilitated countless ones. Alaskan Malamutes can also be pretty stubborn, but I haven't met one worse than any of my rescue huskies.    Again, these were rescues and in most cases a totally well behaved, perfect dog doesn't come along very often. Most huskies are re-homed or turned in due to many of the things I have stated. Many become lost and end up in shelters because they have a tendency to roam/wander and not come when called.    **I know you wanted a second opinion (and wanted it to preferably be positive) but if your WHOLE family isn't 150% committed to a particular kind of dog, don't get it. For your sake, families sake, and for the DOG's sake, don't get one. Since you live at home and most likely go to school or have a job, will you parents be willing to have a stubborn, hard-headed, willful dog around? Probably not since they are ""dead set against it" from the start. **    Perhaps get a husky mix to tone down some of these traits, to get a dog that isn't as skillful. **|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	If you can commit your time and finances into proper, consistent training and give the dog a life of being part of your family, not living alone or shut away, you can have an incredible dog in a Sibe.  They are beautiful, energetic, intelligent and loyal, but remember they are fairly high energy dogs with big exercise needs and they have strong instincts.    Do your research and someone else here has posted great links for you.    Then, if you still want one and can give it what it needs, go for it.|`|mAJm4743aa	hey, siberian huskies are GREAT dogs!!! I have one myself and a large family. They are actually good  dogs, they are great with protection, they are lovable, fun and enjoyable to be around.

They make great family dogs, and do well with children.    They may knock over smaller children in their exuberance. The family should be committed to consistent training and exercise. Siberians need to be a part of the family -- they are pack-oriented, and don't do well stuck outside alone.    Please do plenty of research on this breed before you decide to get one. They aren't the breed for everyone, and too many people buy them because of their looks, without knowing anything about what they're getting into.    http://www.shca.org  http://www.siberianhuskyclub.com/abouthu...  http://www.kaylenbergsiberians.com/ready...|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Just make sure you research it. Go to www.akc.org and look up the breed. Ive heard theyre great. The only thing is that some of them tend to kill and eat smaller animals.

Other than that, i think theyre great.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Our family has had two throughout the years, They were wonderful pets.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	yes they are.  they are very gentle, energetic creatures.
Um8osMNuaa	lf your Mum says no, then it's a no, no amount of persuading will change her mind.   As a mother l know that any pets my two boys ever got l ended up caring for them. lt would be down to your Mum to look after it while your at school ( l assume you are in school) so it's your Mum's decision whether she wants a dog or not.  There is no point getting one unless the whole family are committed to it.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Accept that your mom doesn't want a dog.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I agree with Basset!    If you showed mom that you have the money for the dog ($200-$1,000), it's initial supplies ($200), the first vet check ($200), and have a job to bring in $$ for monthly fees, emergencies, AND save some for college.. as well as proven that you won't dump the dirty work - or any of it - on her.. And she STILL says NO....    Then the only thing you can do is accept her answer and drop the subject like the mature adult you're trying to prove you are. Begging and pleading like a child re-enforces the notion that you are not mature enough to handle the responsibility of a dog. It certainly won't get you your dog!|`|e820051fee78ce7849c9936aa4289823aa	Maybe you could sit down and make a plan, showing training you're going to do, the walking schedule, how you'll fit things in around school, etc. Offer to volunteer at a local animal shelter to prove that you do want this badly.     Ask her what her concerns are, and ask her why she doesn't want you to have a dog. If it is cost, offer to buy X amt of food/toys/supplies in advance (although get a small bag of food first to make sure the doggy likes it!). If she still does not want to let you get a dog, then you'll have to wait until you move out. But if you're volunteering at the shelter you still get to play with and help take care of animals!|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	agree with others, as long as you are living with your parents, they have the say.    I love the experience of dog ownership and I know everybody is different, but I am still not a big fans on teens or children getting a dog.  I don't know your age but guessing by you are still living at home, I assume you are young.    It sounds repetitive, but being a dog owner myself, it is SO TRUE that having a dog is like having a baby.  Can you imagine yourself waking up at 11pm, 2am, 4am and 7am straight for two weeks to take your dog out to washroom, even there is a blizzard going on just because you don't want it to develop any habits washroom indoor?      Young puppy needs to be fed three times a day and go to washroom pretty much every couple or few hours, or immediately upon waking up, eating or drinking.  When you are in school, who is doing this?  Or are you going to let the dog sit on its pee and poo inside the crate while you are in school.    Young puppy needs to be fed three times a day..when you are in school, who is doing this?    Plus puppy is very expensive.  Forget about the initial purchase price and supply cost, puppy can get sick easily.....I have a seven mths old dog and I got him from a reputable breeder with 30 yrs experience and I know both his mom and dad...but he still manages to get sick quite a few times, from picking up Giardia twice, roundworm once, a reaction to vaccine, cut his eyelid when playing with his friend...I pretty much spend closed to $1500 on vet bills so far....Do you think your mom can afford this?    May be you are older than I think or you are working....I apologize if you are, I just want to give you reality of dog ownership so you can truly enjoy a dog...|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Talk about her reasons for saying No. Is it no to a dog or no to the beagle breed?|`|gWdKNkouaa	Tell her that you will feed him, bathe him, and make sure he goes outside when he needs to.    http://www.serpentinewisdom.com|`|v0BgYIHcaa	i dont know. tell me if you find out

If the weather is bad, spray the plant with a light mixture of vinegar and water.|`|BO28Mn8haa	repot the plant, add new soil as well. try a bleach solution (like Clorox Anywhere) and spray the pot|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Throw out the plant, and get the cat fixed.|`|JLOz9rXNaa	get rid of the house plant.|`|6cfb6cd3197d1e471020aecf96fc5902aa	You can repot the plant, shake out the old dirt and repot the plant, If you use the same pot make sure you was the pot.

Is come with a remote.  When the dog diplays an unwanted behavior (barking, biting etc) you press a button.  You can either send a sound pulse or a shock.  Your dog will experience something unpleasant and will associate it with the behavior, in turn correcting the behavior.|`|LtFdsQU1aa	No fair i want a horse!     OK now,    First to get him really used to having the cows and horses around, put him on a leash and walk him around the horses. Maybe even let him sleep in a closed place where he can't get out and make it near the animals then in the morning walk him into the stables and let him smell there sent and then if your dog barks or bites again then take him closer to the animals then evn closer then if you are like to feet away hook him up to something and say good girl/boy to the animals and rub there necks.Then walk back up to the dog and stand there and if he barks again hold his mouth shut for 10 seconds and then say no! firm and loud but don't do it to many times that he thinks his name is no lol. Hope it helps!|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Behavior modification training. Take the animal outside to where the animals are when dog barks firml say NO and redirect dog away from animals use clicker or treat for acceptable behavior and train regularily till desired behavior is achieved.
7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	Take him running|`|0kh2HEFMaa	He probably just gets excited. When he does it, say "ow!" or "ouch!" loudly even if it doesnt hurt, and he will most likely stop. It could also be a domination thing.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Becasue you allow it. Be the boss, never let adog bounce around & jump up while on a leash, that is not the time or place. You are in control at those times & shouldn;t allow this, he could do it to someone walking by you. use a proper collar like a martingale & give him a harsh, NO! & pop the leash at the same time. just becuase he is small doesn;t make it any different than if he was a big dog doing it. Not acceptable. Stop walking, have him sit, Wait til he settles down & say heel, pat your leg & off you go. When he does it, pop the leash, NO, stop walking & have him sit again. he'll get the idea.
DapNp1Kxaa	Yeah, she'll be mad. It depends on alot of things, tho, whether she will accept it eventually or not. Her personality is important. Is she pretty mellow, or is she high strung? The dog should be a puppy, not an adult, so she is able to be the alpha animal. Introduce them slowly. Let her have the run of her house, keeping the puppy in one room for a few days, let them smell each other under the door. Then, put the puppy behind a baby gate for a few hours, so they can see each other, make sure your cat has a secure place she can get to, to escape the puppy, and then try it. If she won't accept it after a few days, you better make a choice.|`|0g0PZmXYaa	well I had to introduce a tiny kitten to my 120 pound dog before :O and it wasn't too hard(: so I think introducing a puppy to a cat would be fine, especially since the dog is small.

If you've noticed that your cat is inclined to be friendly to other dogs then you shouldn't have any problems, however be prepared to conduct a slow introductory process and maybe only have tolerance instead of friendship between the two.  As I said to begin with - depends on your cat and the dog.      Another thought - if you get a young dog the cat (and you) can train the dog more easily to treat the cat as she wishes to be treated no matter what size the dog grows into.
w9aR8ymGaa	thank you for saving a life!    I know this is controversial, but is it possible to do a spay/abort?  Some dogs have up to 14 puppies at once and beings you are enough of a pet lover to opt to adopt instead of buy, I am sure you know how hard it is to get GOOD homes for dogs, especially in this economy when shelters are being hit even harder because people are giving up animals they can no longer afford.|`|Chxoncy7aa	Gestation is actually 63 days.  They can go sooner however.  Start taking her temp twice a day and write it down.  When her temp drops below 100 (99) and stays there, she is getting ready.  If you start taking her temp now, you will get an idea of what her "normal" temp is.  Once it drops, labor will start in about 24 hours, give or take.  Get a whelping box made, and be prepared for some sleepless nights.  An x-ray would be a great idea.  It can give you an idea of how developed the puppies are.  If you can't see the pups on the x-ray, the bones have not calcified yet.  I would get a book on whelping, so you can watch for signs.  Many things you need to watch for, potential problems with mom and pups.    Good luck.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Female guppies can store sperm and deliver a new brood of fry every 3 to 8 weeks for at least six months. The length of gestation varies according to the individual guppy, but depends mostly on the water temperature. Warmer water equals shorter (faster) gestation; cooler water equals longer (slower) gestation.    If you aren't interested in raising all the fry, you can leave the female in the tank with the other fish, and they (the mother included) will simply eat most of the fry.    Other questions:  1. Male guppies are not very prone to fight with each other. The reason many people advise having more females than males is that if it's the other way around (more males than females) the males may chase the females so much they stress out the females.  2. If the water temperature is a reasonably consistent 74 F, you don't need a heater for guppies. Guppies have a wide temperature range for tropicals (I've heard of them being kept at anything from 60 F to 90 F), but their ideal temperature is actually around 75 F, and 74 is very near that.|`|t4x3tr3Qaa	at   normal  trop tank  temps ( 75-80)  the  female  guppy  will   drop (  have  babies )   an  average  about every  23-28  days..  I  f there is  no male  present  with  her   she  can  continue  to  do  this  for  about  6-8 months sometimes longer  as she  has  already  stored  sperm  from  multiple previous breedings...  The  two males  you have   will  not  fight  each other  to speak of... But  if  you add one  female  they  may  quite literally breed her  to  death-- NOT  a  joke I am  being  serious)  several  females  do  much  better  .  whether  you  leave  the  fry in the  main tank  or not you  will eventually  probably  get  a  few  too many  fish ( as  long  as  female  is  able  to  with stand  the  males' advances). So  my  basic  suggestion  would  be  to  leave  her  in the  main  tank.. but  also  to get  a couple more  females  so  she  has  a decent  chance of  surviving...  If  you are not  at all interested  in any  babies  surviving , a  tank of  all male  guppies  does  just  fine...  I  keep my  males  separate  from my  females in  each strain  other  than the  ones  I have  chosen as  breeders..|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	It would be 30 days if the female was being kept in cool water. In tropical temperatures (75F - 80F or so) its more like 21-28 days or so.     I would keep her in the main tank and let nature take it's course, she can have around 3 spawns (varying from 10-50! Sometimes more) without any males present!    Put a bit of java moss in the tank for fry to hide in, the smart ones will stay put and nibble on tiny critters and algae that live in the moss until they're large enough not to be eaten. It is said that a tank kept at around 80F will result in more male fry than female.    If you don't want fry at all, rehome the females and keep males only! If you put the current female back with 2 males she may be harassed to death.
AtLdnZd5aa	I would definitely get new gravel, and the colored kind is painted so it will eventually wash off spend the extra dollar and get natural brown. And the only extra thing you need for a betta is the food that stimulates color, and keep the water around 75f.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	You obviously had gravel that was coated with some kind of coloring, and the coloring stuff is coming off. Yes, I would replace the gravel with one that is not artificially colored. Natural gravels come in a fairly wide range of colors. Choose a dark color and your fish will show much brighter colors of their own.    As you say, don't keep two bettas together in your 10-gallon tank except for breeding, which requires extreme caution. The other main point to betta husbandry is to keep the water warm. Bettas are native to places close to the equator, where it never gets cold, and they like a water temperature of about 80 to 84 degrees F.|`|OsVswissaa	If your gravel is disintegrating you should get new stuff for sure!  A betta would be perfect for a ten gallon.  You probably didn't have a heater for your goldie(sorry for  your loss) but you WILL need one for a betta.  They're not expensive though.  You can and should get lots of live plants for a betta.  That would be way better than goldies in a ten gallon anyway, they don't belong in there.
DLl7qEWTaa	Try to just put a rope around her girth area. Stand with your elbow out so if she turns to bite you she runs into your elbow. Let her get use to the rope around her as she gets more comfortable with it you can make it a little tighter. Go slow it may take you several days to do this. After she is ok with the rope move onto the girth put the saddle on and do the same steps as with the rope. When you get her ok with it tight enough to hold the saddle on walk her around some then tighten the girth some do this til the girth is as tight as you want it. Like I said this will take time to fix you can give her a treat while you are doing this at each step she stand still. I don't but some will.|`|at7LXbEfaa	Well first,.  U DO NOT DO THE BRIDLE BEFORE THE SADDLE  leave the haulter on. and cross tie her so she cant go arouynd a bite u|`|9BwQMXycaa	well before finding a solution...you have to find the cause.  here are some ideas I have of WHY she may be doing this:    -you always girth her up tight as soon as you put it on      you shouldn't do this because she will get sour and/or bloat.  You have to just put it on lose then later tighten it and then tighten it the whole way when you get in the ring before getting on.    -the girth has been pinching her in some spots      When a girth is put on, especially if it isn't shaped and its leather, it can pinch lose spin that they have behind their elbow.  It is important to stretch out their legs infront of them after youve put the girth on to release any lose skin that may be pinched under the girth.    -she may have had a bad experience at some point in her life with girths      When this happens, there isn't much you can do apart from making it all a good experiance instead.    Here are some suggestions of what to do:  -you can buy a flece conver for your girth so it will be more comfortable when you ride her(most of the time it isnt the actual tacking-up but the riding part of the girth that they don't like.  -try passing your hand around her whole girth area to see if she may be soar or pinched or scraped or anything.  Also, you may want to check for bare skin(no fur) that means shes getting a girth gull.  -when tacking her up, put the girth on your shoulder instead of on the saddle so it is near by, when you are to put it on, rub it on her and let her sniff it first to show her it isnt scary and it's not gunna eat her alive. Then put one side on and pass your hand at her girth area and do this till she doesnt move anymore. Once she (and you) is ready, grab the girth on the other side and while still passing your hand at the girth area, slowly bring it up. make sure that you do not aply any pressure whatsoever.  once youve attached it(very lose might I add) scratch her and tell her she is a good girl until she isn't moving again. Then you may tighten it until you can put in a few fingers, stretch out her legs and then tighten again a little bit.  Bring her out(the walking makes it even better) and then tighten all the way.    It takes time, so don't expect results right away...but if you realy keep at it, it'll be all fine!    good luck!  hope i've helped!!|`|n0MxemfYaa	Hi i used to breed dawrf lop rabbits..  don't worry its normal my bunnys do it all the time  one minute there just laying around the next there running around and jumping in there cage.  its quite funny to watch actually...  because there so energetic   don't worry about it shes just having fun  maybe she needs abit more room to run around..
nBKs8fk4aa	Hi..Mites suck big time! but there are many things you can do to get rid of them.  You can soak your snake in a warm bath, or Rubber maid container with warm water for about 15-20 minutes. just let the snake soak in the water or swim in it for a while.  However if the snake defecates replace the water immediately.     Another thing you can do is buy a bottle of Reptile Relief manufactured by "Natural Chemistry", you spray your snake with this a at least twice a day (avoid the eyes) and the mites should start dieing off.    But the most effective way is to use Provent-A-Mite spray. you remove your snake from its enclosure, clean the enclosure, spray it down wit Provent-a-Mite, add the substrate and limbs, spray that as well, then let the cage air out for about 5 minutes, and put the snake back in (make sure the water bowl is not in the tank as you spray.  This is a sure fire way of removing the mites.|`|y87kbxV0aa	ok first of if you have drift wood put it in the oven for two hours on 200 and take all your other decor and soak it in HOT water for two hours and take the snake and put him in warmish water with plastic or tinfoil with holes for about 30 minutes to an hour and then take the tank and spray it ALL OVER with mite spray and spray the substrate then wrap it up in a bag and throw it away and take the tank outside and spray it with a garden hose then dry it of and spray it with mite spray then let it dry then wash it of AGAIN and spray it AGAIN make sure to get in every crack and crevice then get paper towels and and use it as temperary substrate so you can see the mites easily and after your snake is done soak take a q-tip and dip it in mite spray and rub it on the snakes body all over just make sure to NOT get it in the snakes EYES, NOSE, OR MOUTH and then massage him and put him in the tank and after your driftwood is done put it back and after the decor is done dry it and spray it with mite spray and put it back and repeat every day for 3 - 7 days     good luck to you and your snake|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|r8ETcmHMaa	There many thing to do.

Since its has dry skin/fur use one with oatmeal|`|AA11155563	the problem is either you being washed to often and stripping the coat of oils or you eating a crap diet.most likely the second one.you need a balanced good quality dry food, Have you tried the Royal Canin range ?they make a special diet specifically for pugs .try it and guaranteed if you dont eat other treats and scraps for 2 weeks your owner will see an amazing difference. anyway i going for a lie down now talking to a pug has made me feel nauseous. lol|`|Duho7OJRaa	WOW A TALKING ******* DOG!    yeah natural remedy    sulphuric acid/vinegar/shampoo/blood of a goat and seamen|`|I13UuI9faa	My dog had same problem, this is what I did for her.  1) Oatmeal baths only twice a month ( once if you can stand it)  2) Put a few tablespoons of bacon grease to food. Use a natural dog food there could be too much of the stuff your dog don't need  3) If your dog will eat it feed him a scrambled egg once or twice a week, he moght enjoy it! :)  4) Most important Give Lots of love with a daily brushing.  5) Keep his sleeping area clean all the time.     Good Luck I hope this will help you out alot! Try not scratch alot! :)|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Oh i have a black lab and she gets dandruff. What you can do is bathe the dog consistently, so that eventually it goes away. Um...Why are you making believe your, your dog...? Um anyways...GIve it oatmeal baths. The same humans get it works as good. Find out what human lotions you can use on the dog. Because I have read some are safe for them to use. Just be careful with what you use. Once when my mother was little she sprayed perfume on a dog bc it smelled..But the dog actually died from it so be REALLy careful.
XI2iylR4aa	Aww, I'm so sorry.  It really is hard to lose a pet.  And it's especially hard to lose a pet that most people don't understand.    If you lose a dog or cat, people are always sympathetic.  But if you lose a rat or a rabbit, people act like it's no big deal.  They say things like "it's just a rat" or "just get a new one."      It's hard, when you reach out to people and they're like that.  When my rabbit died, I was so distraught, and half the people I talked to said I should have her for dinner.  That really added insult to injury.    So I know how you feel, and I'm really sorry.  This is the worst part of having pets.  You should have a little ceremony for her, and put a pretty stone over the grave.      I hope your other rat is ok.  This page has a tip for keeping rats cool:  http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm co...    I hope you feel better soon.|`|RjyNInW6aa	I am so sorry. i know this might not be a bright side but you can Always get another one. That's how I comfort myself when my guinea pigs die. I can always get babies. I recently got 2 new babies(35 days ago) and one looks like my old one that died in May. She has the exact same personality and loves bossing her buddy around. That is what I do to comfort myself.|`|bb728000386eefef290722161985cc84aa	You might have to have some kind of ceremony or a goodbye experience that feels right for you. I cried and cried when my rat died (she had to be put to sleep and I had to hold on to her all the way to the vet in the next town since our town was so small).|`|Duho7OJRaa	its a rat??    eat it to gain its wisdom.    then bu8y a new one, also why did you call it charlotte like its a little person?    make sure u skin it though, and make a fuzzy willy warmer.    YAAAAAMEEEEEENN|`|6IiCnjoLaa	I'm sorry for your loss but remember the good times|`|5pixuieFaa	I'm so sorry. It's devastating when you lose a pet.. Just think of the good times you had with Charlotte.   You could even produce a portfolio with all of the photos you have of her, memories and anything else to do with her.  Why don't you buy another rat, not as a replacement of Charlotte, but as another rat you can enjoy keeping, and to give your other rat company.    Also, keep your other rat in a cool, shady area and make sure you clean out the cage often, as it will need a freshening up more as it gets hotter, and keep giving it plenty of water.    Good Luck! Give it a few days, you should feel a bit better about the situation then.|`|lzD2Y4cyaa	Gotta try and learn to let go...  It's hard but this is life
yjNoIzGBaa	i am so sorry for your loss  a couple of things stand out   she was at least 12   she had nasal discharge  seizures  loss of bowels  looked fat  sudden death  affectionate   walk a little off    sounds like ethylene glycol poisoning  (antifreeze poisoning)    sings include acting and walking as if intoxicated up to 12 hours post ingestion  seizures   increase thirst,  depression  and sudden death    antifreeze shuts down the kidneys and then the animal is no longer able to produce urine.    animals love the taste of it and not even a teaspoon can be deadly  to cats  there is nothing you could have done  treatment is usually iv, dialysis  and i would say 90% don't make it  there is no cure  even if you would have taken her as soon as you found her   it would have been too late    i am so sorry|`|JdmwlvSRaa	i think she got sick or have disease|`|AA12149303	Maybe she ate some poison (anti-freeze, pest control product) that someone left out while she was still outside. That's strange the way she acted.|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	I'm sorry for your lost. I lost a cat too. She probably ate something bad when she ran away. Like poison or something like it.

She probably ate something while being outside, the thing to do is take her to the vet and have them do an exam to find out the cause of death.|`|x0Z19HJGaa	I am so sorry for your loss! My husband's cat was an outdoor/indoor cat and would get into everything. She would come home beaten up all the time. She had a bad runny nose and didn't want to eat or drink very much for a week. She later left and never came back home. She was about 14 years old. The vet told us she left home to die. We searched for her body but didn't find anything. I believe she died from a bacterial infection. She had several bites on her the last time we saw her and she probably got an infection. It could be anything but after 14 years of her being outside I don't think garbage killed her. Good Luck! And I'm so sorry for your loss.|`|aHtIUZIQaa	I'm sorry for your loss. My kitten died yesterday. She was 4 months old and on Friday night nothing what so ever was wrong with her. We woke up saturday and she wasn't looking good. We thought maybe it was the flew. We made an appointment with the vet for monday. He made her a few needles and told us that she might have been poisoned and yesterday morning she passed away. She was my little baby but what can i do that's life.|`|R4gWNdvgaa	she was old and it was her time... sometimes cats know when they are going to die and they usually leave their home to be alone, i think your was going to do that but then decided she would rather be with you when she passes, im sorry for your loss|`|gTWgbpNFaa	sounds a bit like cat flu, she probably didn't think she had left you but stayed close by some cats can be fiercely independent & probably new you would always be there for her|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Have an autopsy done so you will know. It sounds like she was poisoned or got into something that she should not have. The poor thing! That is horrible.     The only way to know is to have an autopsy done ASAP.|`|cxxbRRl6aa	this sounds like what my cat had. he had a type of cancer. i am srry for ur loss it is hard to get through it. did u take ur cat to the vet at all???
ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	LOL    The fact that the color is emphasized indicates the likely quality (or lack thereof) of the dog in question.    Sounds to me like he got scammed.    Dunno about "Pit Bulls", but you can get a show quality Basset Hound for $1200 - $1500 around here.|`|vPde97E2aa	Never heard the old (& TRUE!!!) quote,"There's a sucker born every minute"?  duh    Funny,that brainless "fad" for blue is SO PASSE',the fool can't even keep up w/current fashion-which,of course meant absolutely *NOTHING* in the first place.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Health guarantees mean nothing this is commonly used by BYB's to scam people into thinking they have a good dog when they dont. I personally would not pay 3 grand for a puppy without knowing that its health certified meaning ofa, cerf (if the breed calls for it) and others each breed has their own specifics. I would like to see the parents first too.     He got scammed big time.  the idiot doesnt even know that the name is not pitbull its apbt or pittbull terrier without the terrier part who knows what he got he could have gotten an american bulldog for all i care.    Edit- Um yeah to the person talking about weimaraners, um im a weimaraner breeder and the blue in weimaraners comes from an undesired gene so its being bred against.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	Scammed.  Three thousand for a bully breed that doesn't have a CH. yet is way over the top.  I won't pay over $1000 for a pet-quality dog from a reputable breeder- and that is with northeast prices being as high as they are.|`|O1HwTBbqaa	Ok 3 grand ????     Is like wayyyyyy out there for a  price of a pup even of champion bloodlines.  Even if the dog was a rare breed.  That sounds like the price of a horse with lots of  dressage & other training.       I have an Akita & a Rotty.. I didn't hardly pay close to 3k for either.|`|b71b424fc067bf9c2eea3e5af4efb630aa	No one wants to admit they got scammed.    I would imagine if the guy has any sense to do any research, he will feel pretty stupid about his purchase, without other people rubbing his nose in it.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	First of all a "blue pit bull" is only a color.  It's nothing special, rare or a different breed.  It's just a color!!!    Second, 3 grand for ANY dog of any breed (that only came with a health guarantee) is NOT a good price.  This guy was scammed, big time.    Were the parents OFA'd or CERF'd?  Were the parents registered with APBT club or UKC?  Were there champions throughout the 5 generation pedigree (that he should have gotten)?  Were all 5 generations OFA'd or CERF'd?  What color are the eyes - blue is a DQ? Where were the pups raised - inside/outside?  Did he see the parents?  How many other dogs did these 'breeders' have?  What kind of health guarantee did he get?    For $3,000 I can get at least 3 top-of-the-line Labrador Retriever pups (or started adults).  We're talking champion pedigree, OFA/CERF/Optigen/Cardiac certs, 5 year health guarantee, show quality and/or impeccable hunt/field trial, started in training/show ring and on full registration with AKC (to be bred with approved mate later).    This guy was severely scr3w3d.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	It's a daft sum of money to pay. He'll be bragging about it, but he'll learn the hard way.

I am 100% against BYB and Puppy Mills.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Better have National Champions for parents for that price.    BTW I do have a dog that I paid 3 grand for.

But I only breed about every other year.|`|A21SswSfaa	Yup, a big joke. I could get one at an animal shelter for $90! And the dog would come to me neutered, up-to-date on shots, and house trained. And I wouldn't care if the dog was blue, red, brindle, or purple, it's just a color. Sadly, there are idiots out there that will charge a fortune for a badly bred dog and some other idiot out there will actually pay that amount!    If I paid that much for a APBt it had better be able to crap gold!|`|WLNX00c3aa	i agree! there are no guarantees that can be bought for $3K.  and most people i know who actually breed pits, only charge for the minimal stuff and the max i've ever seen them sell one of their pups was $1k. only because it was sought after by many buyers. (yes, hate to admit it, there was a bidding war for the pup.)  our friend guarantees that if anything happens to that dog, medical issues/diseases, he would gladly help the new owner with the bills.    that was a scam if i ever read one.|`|yV4KBh2Oaa	To me hes stupid and just money hungry|`|YKPo55j1aa	i agree with what youre saying. 3000 is too much.   however, there is actually real "blue" fur dogs. maybe not royal blue, but bluish tint. definintely not black/brown. its rare, but usually not in pit bulls. weimaraners usually have those.|`|I13UuI9faa	three grand sounds kinda crazy too me. Maybe he got some special papers for the dog or something like that.

Most of the time they won't pay up anyway.  (I work in rescue and have heard 100s of these stories how the breeder or pet store won't pay to have the dog vetted back to health, at best they offer a free or discounted puppy)    This guy is an idiot.  I hope he takes good care of his dog.|`|mXRKdmjLaa	3 grand for a puppy? Are you kidding me? It has to be a joke, like oh my goodness that's crazy! How old is this person?

I was looking for a  non-allergic dog after my German Shepard passed a few years ago because I developed allergies over the years, well I looked from $1500. to shelter dogs & finally settled on the sweetheart in my picture, he was the cheapest of all the mini poodles I looked at, he's smart & full of love, he was $300. & I don't care who can guarantee what, it's a living thing !

Rock on!|`|aZi6BvBraa	3 K for any pup is too expensive!  In my opinion, anyone that buys a pup off a breeder, kills a dog. Go to the rescue centre!  Anyway, health guarantees can never be given, it is alway possible something is wrong with a pup, even if he comes from champion bloodlines. Anybody trying to make a profit on dog breeding is not breeding out of love for the breed and you should wonder about their intentions.|`|pGacaRuFaa	I see people on kijiji all the time advertising "rare" brindle pugs for $2000 or more.

Well my cat did that a lot to me and to my other brother and sisters. She would stare at me for a long time.

UPTu7uIVaa	My cat had tapeworm.  It was one pill, one dose and it was done.  Tapeworm can't be spread from cat to cat like other worms, so if you don't see the worms on their backside then they wouldn't have it.  And it likely was from ingesting a flea.  I've read that fleas usually just hop on to their host for around 10 minutes to eat and then drop back off, so I would think it would be easy to miss if your cats have fleas if there aren't very many.  I don't see fleas on mine, but they get scabs around their necks, and behind their ears and my vet said it was from fleas.  My 3 cats are indoor and I treat them with Revolution for fleas (ear mites, hookworm, roundworm, heartworm as well) even though they don't go outside.  We have a dog and we treat him for fleas but he could still carry them inside.  I buy my Revolution from www.petshed.com.  It is less expensive than my vet sells it for, even after the shipping cost.  Most vets will tell you in order to prevent tapeworm again to treat your cats for fleas.      Also, I actually had to return to my vet for a 2nd tapeworm pill.  I had tried to put it in wet food and the cat ate around it.  Then I mashed it up and put it in the food and she wouldn't touch it.  Threw that one away and had to return to the vet for another.  I bought these things called Pill Pockets (Greenies is the brand) and they are the consistency of Play Doh, I just wrapped a pill with the pill pocket and my cat thought it was a treat.  The pockets are pretty big, I just tore some off and put a thin layer around the pill.  I think you can find them at most pet stores, and my vet sells them (but outrageously).  Just a suggestion if you will be giving the pill yourself and you aren't awesome at prying open kitty's mouth and tossing a pill down her throat...cause I'm not lol.  Good luck|`|oDVx7nSxaa	They get a pill based on weight - expect between 1 and 1 1/2 tablet per cat.  One dose now, one in two weeks.  It is a largish sort of pill (for a cat).  Unless you're good at giving pills, you may want to have a vet tech do the deed for you.  You do need to treat both cats, as tapeworm is transmitted through fleas, and through feces.   If they share a litter box, they will share the worms as well.  After you treat them, dump their litter boxes, scrub them with bleach, and then refill with clean litter.  Do it again after the second treatment.  This will kill any worms or eggs left in the box, and will prevent them from re-infesting themselves.    Even indoor cats can get flea bites.  We bring them in on our shoes and clothes, and they can come in through screens.  It only takes one flea (an infested one obviously) to give tapeworm to a cat, so consider picking up some Advantage for them at the vet.|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	There is a pill that is one dose and no the cat doesn't want it. I mixed my cats in with some tuna and she ate around it so I had to buy a pill dispenser to give it to her. She hasn't had worms since.|`|DDmSV51caa	one dose of Mebendazole should do it. one tab per kitty (based on weight) should do the trick. have them de-wormed regularly (every 6 months to a year) to keep the parasites at bay.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	The pill is probably Drontal, and if I recall, one pill for up to 8 lbs.  Normally, there is one dose, and a follow up fecal test in about three weeks.  Since they share the litter box, both will be treated, but normally you only have to bring one cat in.  Most vets understand if one of your cats has worms, the rest can get it and don't need to see them; just their approximate weight.    If the follow up test is negative, then normally another test after six months just to be sure.    If your cat has never been treated, it probably already had worms.  Kittens usually get worms from their mothers milk, and their mother got it from flea bites.
fO1ZzPXyaa	YES! Some work great. I bought one from wal-mart and hated it. My lab would run straight through, but I love the one I replaced it with. He tried once, but didn't make it through and NEVER tried again! It also has a charger for a built in battery in the collar, so you don't have to order expensive batteries! I've had mine for 4 years and never had a problem. Go to Innotek.com, get the customer service  , and call them. Tell them what you have and need. They'll tell you the best one for you. Great customer service as well. You can also get one with a hand held remote that you can use inside OR outside the fence. It's a $300-$400 investment, but SO worth every penny. Good luck!|`|mnufOa6eaa	Do you mean like the invisible fencing? No and yes, for some dogs they work but for others they don't. Some dogs can run through it so fast they don't feel the shock or some just ignore it. Like Great Pyrenees, breeders of these dogs will tell you not to use invisible fencing because they will just walk right through it and ignore the shock.     Some dogs also can see something, focus on it, and just go right through without even noticing the shock. If you want a fence, I'd go for chain link or wood. That will keep kids and other animals out of your yard. If a kid were to come into your yard and harrass your dogs, your dogs wouldn't be able to escape because of the shock they'd receive if they tried. Or if some random dog came into your yard it could easily attack your dogs and again, they'd have no way to escape.     I personally would never use it.|`|q18xpBpPaa	yea they work. they are no hoax....one thing to be aware of if your dogs like to chase cars. it may freak out cars driving by. to the point of they don't know there is an invisible fence and they think the dog os going to run in front of their car.  chack out my cute bunny!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8my1TXBI...
d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	no, in fact, you will find it to be the opposite.    cats, and all animals that are fed a biologically appropriate diet are innately healthier. their systems function better, including their ability to fight off parasites and disease.     when an animal is on an innapropriate diet, it is wasting energy just trying to find ways to use food that is not sufficient. the animal degenerates.   most cats eat grain based foods, and the number of cats experiencing organ failure(kidney/renal, etc) is also growing.     these things are linked.     if an animal is not being properly nourished, the body will shut down.       BUT, if the animal is properly nourished(and prey modle raw is just that), then the cat as a whole will thrive, and will have no trouble fighting off disease.|`|nX2pSke8aa	i  don't  care  for  it.  if  there is  another  way  to  lose  weight  let  me know.|`|YBcB0732aa	"How is toxoplasmosis diagnosed in cats?    Toxoplasmosis is usually diagnosed based on the history, signs of illness, and the results of supportive laboratory tests. Measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in the blood can help diagnose toxoplasmosis. The presence of significant IgG antibodies to T. gondii in a healthy cat suggests that the cat has been previously infected and now is most likely immune and not excreting oocysts. The presence of significant IgM antibodies to T. gondii, however, suggests an active infection of the cat. The absence of T. gondii antibodies of both types in a healthy cat suggests that the cat is susceptible to infection and thus would shed oocysts for one to two weeks following infection.    Sometimes the oocysts can be found in the feces, but this is not a reliable method of diagnosis because they look similar to some other parasites. Also, cats shed the oocysts for only a short period of time and often are not shedding the oocysts when they are showing signs of disease. A definitive diagnosis requires microscopic examination of tissues or tissue impression smears for distinctive pathologic changes and the presence of tachyzoites. "

Mu1vMc7Maa	i'm not a fan of "goodbye" my lovely. it sounds like she's dying. sorry!  (that's just the impression i got as soon as i read the name)     i do like Love though    and you can use mane and tail on horses which is also a human shampoo that you can get at grocery stores. the problem with most human shampoos is that they smell really good and insects are attracted to the smell. mane and tail comes in a spray thing too. (its a shampoo bottle that connects to your hose.. really handy!)|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Lovely girl  Lovely lady   Lady Love|`|KeQOHakpaa	i like the name lovely, or you could use...    amore (love in french and italian)  amada (spanish for beloved)  belle (means lovely in french)  amora (love in spanish)    add- you can absolutly use human shampoo on horses, we use it on all of our darker horses (aka, non grays since we use shampoo that is specifically for getting stains out :). we just use the shampoo on the horses body and then use both the shampoo and conditioner in the mane and tail. plus there are unscented human shampoos if you don't want to use scented. just make sure all the soap gets washed out.|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	Well, Goodbye My Lovely, that sounds kinda depressing. Lovely, Love, Sweet Girl, Lovely Grace. I'm not sure. depending on the kind of horse and breed and all, but maybe Lovely Grace.|`|edglcOydaa	how about    Soontoobe dogmeat|`|8rVodF9vaa	Is Goodbye My Lovely the name she has now?

Goodbye my lovely really does sound depressing,...Instead of calling her lovely,I'd call her Kisses..:D Also,yep..human shampoo works fine..and lots of horse people use it,but it doesn't save money in the longrun because most horse shampoos can be diluted up to 1-20..so yeah.|`|ivX7KIHvaa	determined delightful de-lovley, if you have ever seen the show Gilmore girls they have this joke that is demented delightful de-lovley,  but most people dont like the demented part so i changed it to determined i think its cute,|`|MaAtfDV7aa	Lovely or Lovey.

TPe7yiBYaa	To answer your first question, you can have either one thermometer in the middle of the tank, or one on the hot and cool side. Just remember to place it midway between the top and bottom, because if you place it all the way at the top it will read hotter since hot air rises, and it will read cooler at the bottom since cold air sinks. However, since a ball python is not arboreal, I would place it closer to the bottom than the top.  Also, you should have a heating lamp on during the day, but at night turn it off ( would YOU like to be in direct sunlight 24/7?) and turn on the heating pad during the night.  Monitor the temperature, don't let it get colder in the tank than 75F (about 24C) or hotter than 85F (about 30C). And if you notice your snake never moving from one side to the other, adjust the temperature to make it more comfortable for your snake.     I hope I've helped, check out this website if you have anymore questions.     http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide...|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Let's say you are using a heat lamp to heat your ball python's cage and the bulb goes out and the pet store is closed and it is REALLY cold outside. If you have a heat pad ready to go for this kind of emergency, your snake will not have to suffer because of the lack of a heat source. I feel that snake keepers that live in parts of the country where it becomes very cold in the winter should have a secondary heat source on hand to use when it is necessary for their snakes. You can get 2 thermometer strips, one for each side of your snake's enclosure. I prefer digital thermometers with probes. The probes can be placed right on the substrate or bedding. Stick-ons measure the temperature of the glass sides of your snake's cage instead of the ground level where your snake is actually at most of the time. You will need a hygrometer. This measures the humidity level inside your ball python's cage. This is available in the stick-on dial form and, the digital style with a probe. This can be placed in the center of the cage.|`|xPMya3CGaa	I'm not sure about pythons, but I used to have a gecko, I used a heating pad/rock for him as it helped aid in digestion. I am from canada too and it got colder here than he liked. I also had a heat lamp on him in the tank (15gallons) and he could go into a shade spot when he got to warm and back to his rock/lamp when he wanted to warm up.|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|GPV0YRPpaa	hi id just pick one or the other and i would rather use the matt as bulbs dry out the air so you would have to spray the viv every day as ball pythons sheds aint good any way so it would be easyer with a heat matt|`|sSJ8zfebaa	just got done reading on this.dont need the lamp.heat rises.a pad will work much better|`|44gTtORXaa	You need a thermometer in the top right and bottom left  to give you a temperature gradient.  If you use the heating pad (under the tank, not inside) make sure you have the correct temps in the cage- 85-90f.  Also, only run it 2/3 the way of the tank, you want a cool side.   If you use the heating lamp as well, do not put it over the heat mat, it will be too hot.   Last, An adult ball needs a minimal 30 gal tank, so you should upgrade as soon as you can.|`|CUFnorZyaa	Didn't you ask the same thing yesterday?    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|r8ETcmHMaa	Yes you need a heat lamp and heating pad. I only have a set of thermometer,hygrometer in my 20 gallon. But you should probably have 2 sets.|`|zBH33xb5aa	i only use a heat mat.
gM7VuCM4aa	Someone asked the question last week, "Would you eat a Sea Kitten?"   The following was my answer:    "The folks at PeTa need to get their priorities right and pick their battles. "Sea Kitten" is a name or term invented solely by PeTa to make us feel more compassionate towards fish! They reason that people would be less likely to eat something if it was called a "kitten". "People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals" is not a conservation group, they have nothing to do with saving species on the brink of extinction. Below is a copy of their mission statement (read more after):    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), with more than 2.0 million members and supporters, is the largest animal rights organization in the world.    "PETA focuses its attention on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for the longest periods of time: on factory farms, in laboratories, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment industry. We also work on a variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of beavers, birds and other "pests," and the abuse of backyard dogs."     "PETA works through public education, cruelty investigations, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns."      It is my strong opinion that PeTa needs to go back and read their own mission statement and spend more time on the real issues, animal abuse and neglect. Everyday we see on the news and TV animal abuse cases so disturbing it makes me wonder about who is the more evolved species! We still use lab animals and that is extremey cruel! I just wish PeTa would focus on things that are more pressing and more cruel than the fishing industry. I'm not saying they are a bad organization, not at all, I just think this time they have over done it to the point where now they won't be taken seriously and it is the animals that will suffer more.     Than again, maybe this right here is exactly PeTa's intent, to make us discuss "Sea Kittens" and how ridiculous it is...it is still putting focus on their issues.     I live in Maine a State that fishing is one of our main industries, especially lobster. Our lobstermen our going out of business due to the poor economy. They are not tortured in labs, they are not endangered in anyway, in fact, they are giving them away at half their normal cost! With PeTa's mentality we should call them "Sea Puppies" and let the lobstermen go out of business!     As a PS: I have lost some respect for PeTa over this Sea Kitten campaign and will be less likely to listen to future issues they present and focus my donations on more credible organizations."    So as you can see by my answer to that question not everyone does support Peta even though they very much support animal rights. The best thing we can do is NOT support Peta, they are not focusing their efforts in accordance with their own mission statement and have become Nazi like in areas that do not even need to be addressed! They want to stop dog and cat shows to, they claim it is abusive! I happen to go to cat shows and show my Maine Coons. The people that organize cat shows are cat clubs and cat clubs are involved with more than just pedigreed animals. They help raise money for local spay/neuter programs and rescue work and help educate people on proper pet care. The animals at pet shows are not abused or neglected in the least but Peta wants to stop this! I'll say it again, I've totally lost respect for Peta as an animals rights organization.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	PETA BREAD!|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	I support PETA...People Eating Tasty Animals that is.... :)    We live in a world where a person will call 911 when an animal is in a car on a hot day and a child is right next to the dog. Also where a person will get more time in jail for animal abuse than child abuse.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Wow i never knew that im going to stop supporting them thats wrong i never really supported them any way i just thought they were people against Animal testing,eating,cloth making ect... ,but i will never give up my animals/Pets for them ever i can't believe she answerd like that in my eyes Humans And People are the same,but i whouldnt hit the Boy for the Squirrel thats just crazy the lady has problems ,but i guess she isnt the only one out there like that. i Also didnt know they Donated to Testing labs for cancer,Aids ect.. i mean i hate people get cancer,but it isnt right to put it on the animals thats not like the Squirrel and Boy thing thats like totally dif OMG PETA SUCKSS..      i quess we live in a really Fu**** up world it's like when somebody pops their child for throwing a temper tantrum they look right pass it ,but when they pop a dog for being bad It 911 imediantly. Or When they say it's not O.K to abuse a animal ,but it's perfectly Fine to Test on them! Some people are just Selfish thats how it's always going to be sadly!        Also whats with PETA   People  Eating   Tasty   Animals whats that about do they support it or not!!|`|tnTxHVO5aa	The people that support PETA are like lemmings that will follow each other off a cliff.  There is a reason that PETA is considered a Domestic Terror organization.|`|psqkf6rMaa	peta members like you say are freaks they like to kill animals like that baby polar bear and most animals in there care        call fish fish not sea kittens|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Rule  1 - About 10 percent of the population are complete idiots.    Rule  2 - Celebrities come from the same gene pool as the rest of us.    However I support PETA:  People for the  Eating of  Tasty   Animals|`|U6lQVtF5aa	It's a view of life.  They believe animals are equal to humans.  I don't agree, but I can see how they'd get that.  In essence, to them, when asked to choose between a squirrel and a boy you're asking them to choose between an African American and a Caucasian person.    Hopefully posed that question you wouldn't choose one over the other too easily (it would be racist)...to them Squirrels are just like another race.  It's not a normal belief...but it's their life choice.
WLNX00c3aa	the most stated comment will be...EXERCISE.  but in honesty, i believe your dog found that the texture of the zipper is different and continues to chew on them.    it's like a child or anyone who finds that one thing that tastes good and they keep eating it.  so in your case, the dog found the zipper. so what you must do is:  1. keep all zippers out of reach. the ones he can reach spray it with bitterapple spray or even a mixture of cayanne pepper.  2. when you catch him chewing, sharp "NO, bad dog" and then spray with a water bottle or clap your hand.    keep it up and eventually he'll associate,  'alpha doesnt want me to chew on this.'|`|b1TjlYODaa	Many canine misbehaviors are born out of instinct, and most arise from either boredom or stress. Any behavior can be made much worse by inadequate training or poor handling.

Firmly, say know when spotting it. Take the dog away from it and give it a bone or chew toy. Soon the dog will pick up not to chew zippers, chew toys.|`|cVOQUBXeaa	Dogs will chew almost anything.  If you want to get him to stop, you'll have to train him to stop.    One way is to take a spray bottle (buy an empty one at the store and fill with clean water) and spray him in the act.  After a while, he'll understand that if he does it, he'll get wet and stop.  You can use this on him on almost any disobediant behavior, just don't it around anything electrical or delicate.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Sounds like he's bored, take him out more.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	He might be bored with the toys he has. Try getting him a kong and fill it with kong stuffing. It will keep him busy for a while. And make sure to let him know when he chews on a zipper, take it away as your saying no, and give him one of his toys.|`|MBwdtRqDaa	awwww... that's cute.... I think he likes the coldness on his gums? What do you think?  Maybe you can freeze some of his hard chew toys & see if he likes that. My little guy likes to chew ice cubes once in a while. Just keep the zippers away cause he can hurt himself....
1CVOHoapaa	Oh yes of course you can.   I have three beans that I swapped for my mums old cow.

A9qDWpXUaa	As has been said you must totally ignore him until he is calm and then, and only then, give him some attention. You say it takes some "heavy effort" to calm him down but what you are actually doing is increasing the frenzy of the game. As far as he is concerned you become great fun, so be boring instead.    I will warn you that in the beginning he will increase his attention grabbing antics but if you see it through and do not join in it will take less and less time for him to calm until he doesn't bother at all.    You must combine this with working on his basic training but make sure you play train, that is his reward for getting it right is his toy and a game, in this way he learns that he still gets the game its just on your terms and for doing what it is you want.    If you do this you both win, you get a calm, attentive and obedient dog and your dog gets an interesting and fun owner who is worth listening to.    When dogs like this come into my home I employ the 5min rule which is no attention or affection until the dog has been calm and left me alone for 5mins which is when I will call him to me to say "Hi".|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Put him in a crate until he calms down|`|b1TjlYODaa	I guess that's pretty normal because Labs are very playful and energetic. They're very intelligent too! This topic, http://xrl.us/becabe illustrates more interesting things about this breed. Have fun learning about your lovable dog!|`|nLTeJ0Rmaa	just plain DONT PAY ATTENTION to him until/unless he settled down. dogs understand body language. put your head way up into the air and ignore, do not make eye contact, do not touch. if necessary turn your back. A mother do will do this when her pups are "bothering" her. As a last resort, "growl" (literally) at the puppy. Once the pup settles down, give him a toy to carry in his mouth, it will help him to re-focus his energy. Eventually your dog will run and get a toy when a new person enters, or when you come home, and rather than whacking into you, he will simply run around and "show off" his toy.|`|I13UuI9faa	Labs are EXTREMLY smart! and can learn with persistance! Are you the only person who he does this too? What you need to do is when you enter and he jumps, turn your back to him till he sits or calms down, then pay attention to him but for a minimal time.Let him know when play time is and is not! You are the leader not him.Training not only stops there, you have to walk him at least 40 minutes to an hour twice a day, if you can't find someone who can because as you know by now labs are FULL FULL of ENERGY!!!  :)  :) I know I have three chocolates.They need to learn what you expect of them or they will do what they please, and they can be  destructive on a house believe me I know. :) Teach him tricks too.   I wish you Lots of Luck with your lab! God Bless you Both !     ps make sure your family members in the household help you to be persistant with your labs training. :) it helps.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Sounds like a normal Lab puppy to me.    Remain calm yourself, and don't pay any attention to him until he is sitting quietly.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	He's very excited to see you.  He obviously loves you a lot.  As long as he's running circles and not jumping up then you are doing better than most large breed owners, lol. :)    I would suggest taking him on a good 30 minute walk before you leave.  Walk him around the neighborhood then play with him for about 10 minutes before you walk out the door.  That should tire him enough so he's not quite as rambunctious when you come home.    You can also put a box of treats in your car.  When you get home take a treat out, as soon as you walk in the door say your dogs name and tell him to sit (while showing him the treat).  When he sits, give it to him.  This will teach him that when you come home, and he sits, you give him a treat.  Then you love on him and give lots of praise at his level on the floor.    You could also put a toy in your car.  Bring the toy to the door when you open it, as soon as your lab comes running up have him sit and then throw the toy.  He'll retrieve it and you'll get to come in without him running circles around you.    If he IS jumping up you need to either push him back (your open hand on his chest or the top of his head) or lift your knee into his chest.  Don't kick him or knee him!  Just lift your leg up so when he jumps he hits it and bounces back to the floor.  Do not hurt him trying to do this.      Don't forget, he's still a puppy.  :)  I have 2 Labs. One male (3 yo) and one female (5 yo). Our female still wants to jump sometimes when you come home but our male has learned that it's better to just roo-roo-woof at us and walk in circles.  They both still get the attention they want, but not when they ask for it. :)    Good luck!|`|SlxeK1p6aa	erm this is really difficult because labs are very energetic     a good way is to ignore them when they get too excited but it doesn't always work.    there isn't really much you can do
K0uTjeWiaa	You need an x-ray to determine if it's cancer. If it is treated early, your cat can survive  You gave no symptoms and there are many other things in cats that causes weight loss. Diabetes, hyper-t, crf, ibd ect. All of these can be treated but you need to find out exactly what is wrong.   Best of luck|`|JLOz9rXNaa	ohhh. follow ur vets  advice and make sure she has plenty of foods that she likes to eat.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	Leukemia is very common in cats and as far as i know incurable. Also, it can be caused by a virus so you may want to wait awhile before getting another cat. Sometimes they catch the virus when they go out for the night so keeping them inside all the time will prevent future infections. All of the cats in my grandparents neighborhood where wiped out recently from this and they all became very thin before dying.|`|viUbPWNTaa	Is she drinking and urinating more than usual?    Untreated or under treated diabetes causes weight loss. It also causes increased thirst and urination.    Did you vet do any blood work on your cat?    A diabetic cat will have high levels of glucose in their blood and glucose in their urine.    If there is a high level of glucose in the blood and glucose in the urine, the correct diagnosis about 98% of the time is diabetes.    Ask your vet about this.|`|os6htVVhaa	sometimes cats loose weight if they have worms has she been wormed?|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	I wouldn't dare second guess a Vet.  You are having a problem accepting it and that I understand completely.  Your role can only be making the cat as comfortable as possible and as engaging (attentive) as possible before you have to leave for school.  Of course you don't want her to die, but if she is sick you don't want her to suffer, either.  Going off to school is going to make this easier for you.  You are not abandoning her and all of what she has been to you will always be with you.  You are the better for it.    A cats' life expectancy is shorter than that of a man.  It is an eventuality and has nothing to do with fairness.  What is right, though is your life has been enriched because you took time to love an animal.  You never lose that...and such sustaining memories of "precious".    Peace be with you|`|YBcB0732aa	You can go to another vet for a second opinion.
nY1nq9hCaa	My mum got two feral cats from the rescue centre and it took them time too.  Try keep them in until they get used to feeding times and less scared of you before you let them out to do there thing.  It will take time but do not over power them with what you call love cos this could freak them out.  Have a calm and less smothering attitude when patting them etc let them come to you too.      Maybe it was not a good idea to get them when you have a 2 year old.  If the cats are freaked as it is, a prodding 2 year old wont help.  That will change as the cats get older and more friendlier.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	It helps that you are keeping them together.  As you can see their personalities are different.  Keep at it.  The more time you spend, the quicker the trust can be built.  You have little idea what they hay have endured as feral kittens but you see the female learned protectionism, caution.  Good for you!  Just don't expect he same of both of them.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Neutering will make him calmer.  At their age, I wouldn't wait too long, as you risk them hitting sexual maturity.  (Females get spayed, and good for you doing so.)    They probably had quite different background experiences. It will take them awhile to adjust.  And just when you start to give up, they may turn and become affectionate.  Right now, they may be uncertain if their good luck will be permanent.    Doing the spay/neuter right away probably won't make any difference in their becoming used to their new home.  And once that is done, they stay were they are without additional lengthy vet visits.|`|24T71hYjaa	Depending on how long they have been feral, it may take many weeks.|`|sGsRLenhaa	well done for your kindness & patience in giving these two cats a loving home :) they will settle down in time, it just takes a while for them to build up trust  good luck & enjoy your new pets!|`|332dd8467b31eeba85e0c5b0ec33f75aaa	Get a puppy cage, they are big enough for food and a litter tray, put a box in it, and put it so the kittens can see whats going on, leave them in it for the busy parts of the day, and leave the door open in the evening, that way they are in a safe place, can get used to the household noise, and can come out when its quiet, all kitties take time to get used to thier new homes, sometimes up to months! just be patient, keep encouraging them, and they will be part of the family in no time, dont let your 2 year old pull them about tho, or there could be trouble!|`|wAzNCS48aa	I would keep your son away from here for a while because he make spook her with loud noises and such. Just give her sometime and she will come to. if not try taking here into a room with you and close the door and just sit there and see how she reacts. Don't go to her..let her come to you. Hoped that this helped|`|RW2D2VlMaa	It just takes time carry on exactly what you are doing, and they will settle down and get used to you.|`|by6skUmMaa	I got my cat when she was stray, probably about the same as yours, but cant be sure. And she was so frightened of my family at first. She would come near any of us and i used to sit with her while she ate and she got used to me. She likes my family now. But hates the sound of male voices and she hates any strangers in the house.    These cats could have been treated badly by a man...? Which is why they don't like your husband... Maybe you should both sit with them while they eat and it might relax them. But don't try too hard otherwise they might associate that with eating and then might not eat.    This is going to sound weird but rub the cats blankets or what ever they sleep on, onto you... They will pick up the scent and like it, because it will smell of them.    10 days is still a very short amount of time... And they need to get used to you and build up trust, so just be patient and don't make any sudden movements otherwise it might frighten them.    Hope that helps.|`|ree7wp74aa	hi it can take a while for them to settle after all u have taken them from the life they knew, and given them shelter warmth regular food and love, they are going to be a bit afraid of that at first, i have 5 boys and 2 girls i find the girls are always more nervous than the boys, ie the door bell rings the girls run and hide the boys cant wait to see whos coming in. u proboly wont even notice when it starts to happen but the girl will be finding her feet very slowly, when your not about she will be making your house her new home, and when u are quitely watching tv or something she will be watching u and getting used to your habits. haveing the fixed will help. they are both young enough to learn how to be loved by humans, be patiant she may never be a lap cat but she will be happy. sounds  like u are doing everything right well done. and good luck|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	it took my one cat that was a stray about 3 months before she would come to me of her own free will and now she is 10 and my baby|`|gMsV1yIDaa	It can take a long time to settle them. When you approach them squint up your eyes and lick your lips. This is a greeting they do themselves and it works. I did it with my ferrel cat and she is fine with me now.
XJ9oSR2daa	There are Quarter ponies, not a registered breed, but I have seen them advertised and promoted.    Right now, halter and showmanship training with her age.    But later on, you can go into every class they offer with open horse shows.  Is your horse registered as a QH but under 14.2?  You could still show it in breed QH shows, but you probably won't do well because of the height.    But open horse shows will have games and all the pleasure classes and all those are open to your horse.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	grooming and showmanship is very basic and the first class you should train him or her to do. If you ride him or her walk trot, walk trot canter, and trail 9 trail takes alot of training )|`|mnufOa6eaa	You do know Quarter Horses aren't ponies don't you? If it's a pony, it's not a Quarter Horse and vice versa.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	Halter is about all I could think of, as this horse is too young to be under saddle.|`|fIkriTAQaa	Halter & showmanship.    Halter is judged on conformation...so if you had pics and asked a question about her conformation people can basically tell you if you'll do good in halter or not. Ask something like this "Looking at these pics would my horse do good in QH halter?"    Showmanship is all about how you show her and the pattern. It may be Start at cone A squared. Walk to cone B and pivot to the left 90 degrees. Trot to cone C. Walk to the judge for inspections.|`|z90jPBMLaa	You can start showing horse from a baby in halter classes. If you ride english. Maybe try Jumping or Trail which can also be western. western maybe try games or reining. all this classes takes a horse thats athletic. Or maybe you want to just take it easy and show in pleasure classes. I would pick a couple things and train her alittle bit in each and see what she picks up faster and she seems to enjoy the most and you enjoy and go from there.|`|8rVodF9vaa	showmanship?
y7H1V39Jaa	Single passenger sulky.B|`|8bTder08aa	Standardbreds pull a vehicle called a sulky in races.  A sulky is usually a one-person vehicle, although if you're small enough, light enough, and crazy enough, you can have a second person perch on the side of the driver, very uncomfortably crouched kind of on the shaft trying not to interfere with the driver.  Been there, done that, and I do not recommend it.  (I did it when I was young and insane.  I look at some of the things I did with horses in my teens and twenties and shudder now.)    As Mulereiner indicated, a meadowbrook is a good driving vehicle.  There are lots of others.  If you seriously want to get into driving, I highly recommend that you try to find a local driving club near you and get a mentor.  While virtually any horse that can be taught to work under saddle can be taught safely to drive, it is not as simple as just throwing a harness on a horse and away you go.  You haven't seen a wreck until you've seen a freaked-out horse running away with a cart behind it.      Good luck and enjoy!|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Its called a sulky    But those are extremely uncomfortable for a fun drive.    If your horse is bombproof with driving, look into meadowbrooks, pricier, but way more comfortable.    Even easy entry carts are ok, but not as comfortable as they above.|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	a sulky.or sulkie,not sure of spelling.|`|AA11452643	A death trap, aka sulky.    I'd call around and see if this idea would be safe. All you need now is an out of control horse barreling through town with a suly full of screaming kids.    Think it through to insure sfaety.|`|9N56lFMaaa	That would be a sulky, and would be for 1 person only, no passengers. Properly training a driving horse takes a lot of time, knowledge and experience - it's not something to be taken lightly. An accident with a driving horse and carriage is not pretty and can often result in serious injury for the horse, driver and/or passengers. An ex-harness racer is probably not the wisest choice for a pleasure driving horse unless you have a lot of experience with retraining. Look for a person in your area that does driving training or shows driving horses. They can give you an idea of how expensive purchasing equipment (quality harness and cart) is and possibly allow you to drive an already trained horse to see if you even like it before investing in your own.
ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	She *might* have a mild back injury.    *I* would prefer to have that looked at sooner rather than later, however if you wish to wait on the vet visit I would put her on STRICT crate rest in the meantime, so that the injury has a chance to heal and won't get worse.  You don't want to run the risk of paralysis.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Could be arthritis, could be a spinal injury or she could have jarred the hips or pelvis amongst other things.    I would personally take her to the vet sooner rather than later to give them the best chance of helping her. If you absolutely have to wait until the 6th, try and keep her rested as much as you can and don't let her try and climb up on things like the sofa as it will put more pressure on her.    Good luck and I hope it's nothing serious.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Have your vet refer you to a canine orthopedic vet.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Limping huh? maybe something it stepped on is hurting it.

vwSgLETwaa	Get that poor gerbil to a vet first and foremost! They might be able to save it!    As people have said, its possible the environment they were in together was too small, or there was not enough food in there so they were fighting over who gets it. Also, do you have female gerbils in close proximity? They can sometimes start fighting when the female is fertile even if she isn't in the same cage!    Also, if the environment the gerbils were in is TOO big something called "de-clanning" can happen, where they each pick their own territories within the cage and defend it to the death.    For the gerbil you now have in the ball, you can make a temporary cage out of a storage bin - fill it with wood shavings and tissue paper or whatever substrate you usually use and pop some chicken wire over the top. For the gerbil that needs medical attention and FAST, make sure the bedding is clean and primarily clean white toilet paper, which you will need to change every couple of days while the wound is healing if he pulls through.    If your gerbil does survive, you can reintroduct the two brothers eventually by using what is called a "split cage" method - i recommend  googling this and joining a gerbil forum for further guidance, it can be a tricky process!    Good luck, i hope your injured gerbil pulls through xxx|`|x3mFm4exaa	I have never had one of those but I heard that they tend to do that.......sorry|`|XtudJ1dXaa	LOL|`|f8ed328242d905d1e234676aa09ce11faa	It was hungry.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Is your cage set up large enough that they don't feel crowded? Canabilism in rodents is often due to the stress of overcrowding.
M7yJJKB9aa	Look for some place that sells plexiglas/acrylic. They offer different sizes, so you can give them your measurements for the top of the cage as well as the divider. This is something that is very sturdy and easy to clean, as well as holding up well to scratch marks. And a bonus with this is the fact that they can still see each other. I hope this helps, I have no idea on the cost, but it can last for years. I think this will be the best choice as far as a divider. For the top, you might need to add some additional weight or get a thicker cut.  Good Luck!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Go online.  Don't know of a site, but you can just do a search.|`|FKhWEd5kaa	I had the same problem finding a cover. I ended up buying a couple of children's sleeping bags and sewing them together. It does a wonderful job of both covering and insulating.|`|8ORwpuTuaa	Try zooplus or justlovedogs.    You can find them online.|`|6xCTdxEJaa	if you know who the person was who you bought the cage from maybe they could help you to find a cover and a cage divider that would fit correctly.|`|3VO81VDSaa	look at karma charms, they have them i think, if you search for karma charms it will be in your search engine
FcR8G8hPaa	You need to know the horse will obey you at pretty much all times. If the horse tends to be hard to handle, it means he has gaps in his training and you will rightly not feel confident until they are closed. It's hard to give specific advice without knowing what those are, but here are some ideas.    Spend time with this horse on the ground. This means walking him with a lead rope. Enforce with him.. walking at your pace, starting when you start, stopping when you stop.    Take him around the property and inside your arena and find out what, if anything spooks him. Then work with him to remove the spook factor. Often people are bucked off by a startled horse. All someone has to have done was move something from one place to another.    Ride another horse who's not hard to handle and review your handling of reins, spurs, crop or whatever other aids you use. Are you hard on the mouth? Do you require immediate response and correct the horse when you don't get it? Fix what you need to here.    Lunge the hard to handle horse and enforce the speed you want. Do lots of gait transitions, then switch directions, then do more. Don't get on him until he is light and responsive.    In the saddle on the "hard to handle" horse, stick with a walk, do lots of gait transitions from walk to stop, maybe try walk to trot and trot to walk and stop. Correct him when he's not responding quickly enough and reward him when he is. Do a lot of lateral work like half-pass, side pass, shoulder in. Do small and large circles and figure eights. If the horse rushes at any gait, as soon as he speeds up (1 second window) stop him or transition to the next gait down and correct him if he fails to be responsive.    All this should help. Good luck!    EDIT: This horse is not very trained and will need a lot of work.The exercises above will help, but they presuppose a reasonable foundation of training that may not be there. I would suggest treating this horse as if it were a colt that needed to be started under saddle, and work very carefully up from the most foundational training items. Where you find a gap, fill it before moving on. You are likely to need the help of a professional horse trainer who can come see and assess the horse and give you some recommendations.    A trainer on site may see more or less to worry about than I would sitting out here on the internet. Even an hour of evaluation by a good pro trainer could be a huge help to you.|`|hjkP5v4kaa	sounds like a barn sour horse to me,  get a martingale so he cant throw up his head.  also sounds like hes being a prick,  you need trust but sounds like also some tough love,  take control, work him on the ground, and work him in a ring so he cant bolt.  also maybe have someone very confident like a trainer get on him and work out the kinks.  hope i helped :)|`|psNR7hDJaa	Get a trainer to help you out. Also, don't get a martingale or tie downs. Those are just little aids that don't do anything well.And tie downs are to prevent the horse to putting his head way up. But you should train this horse not to do that anyhow.|`|PjdLtGxYaa	try join-up(monty roberts) it will help your horse trust you too  heres a site with some of the info about that http://www.montyroberts.com/ju_about.htm...   also you may want to try just spending time with your horse maybe grooming, walking, lunging, etc hope i helped some :)|`|3wIZiZA5aa	If you ride Western, I would consider getting a tiedown or Martingales. For ground Work, yeah, your horse definately needs it. I used Clinton Anderson's DVD, Round Penning Parts one-three, and it explained alot to me about my horse and how to get more respect from him. I bought mine off of eBay for cheaper than the Clinton website. It has worked wonders, and my horses are very well behaved now.    Hope this helps!     http://downunderhorsemanship.com/catalog...
kHeXKtKraa	Parakeets are small parrots.  You can give your parakeet anything you would give a parrot and the list is ENDLESS.  Just ask one of my parrots!  They eat whatever I eat.  Don't give your bird avocado, caffiene, alcohol (duh) or chocolate (because of the caffiene).  Salty and sugary foods really shoud be avoided too.  I also avoid diet foods for mine because of the chemicals, but that is jsut me.  What can you give her?  Corn (cooked or fresh, hard or soft) peas (a huge favorite) carrots, lettuce, beans, apples, watermelon (include the seeds) melon (again, include the seeds) hot peppers (include the seeds).  I could go on and on.  Cooked or raw pasta.  Cooked rice...  Seriously, it would be easier to list what not to give.  Fruit including oranges, kiwi, POMEGRANATE (oh my birds will mow you down for that one!)  Of course nuts, if you have them in the shell that is best, but crack the shell for her so she can get to it.  Maybe half a walnut still in the shell.  She will enjoy having something to work at and play with.  Oh, yeah, grapes, but you might have to slice one first before she gets the idea.  And if she is not interested in these new foods from her dish, try hand feeding her the foods until she gets the idea that she can eat it.  Sometimes they have to see you eat it before they will eat it.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	caramel
kHeXKtKraa	By all means get the larger one.  Like some of the other posters said, it will save you from the inevitable task of getting one that is right in the future.  You will only have to make this purchase one time - if you get the right cage from the start.  If you think about it every bit of extra space INSIDE the cage is actually doubled, because your bird will be able to use the OUTSIDE space as well for climbing and playing.  If at all possible, try to avoid a rounded top cage, only because that space tends to go to waste.  Many flat topped cages have optional play gyms to attach to the top.  Even if you don't get one of those, you can set up toys and food dishes and your new companion will probably enjoy sitting on top of his cage for at least part of the day.  Another problem with the rounded tops is that if your bird decides to be uncooperative with you when you try to pick him up, it is often really hard to get him with a big cage hump between the two of you.  Once you get your cage, give your bird lots of different sized perches with different surfaces at many different levels in the cage.  If possible try to give him at least one spot that he can open his wings fully.  My Grey refuses any bath except her water dish, even though she can barely fit her feet into it.  She uses her beak to hold onto the bars above her water dish and steps down and then back up.  Because of that, I always make sure that none of her toys hang down near her water dish so that she can flap while taking her little hootchie bath.  The larger the cage, the more likely you are to have room.  Tall is not as good as wide, because your bird will spend most of his time on the higher perches and sortof 'waste' the lower space of a tall cage.  Also, with a tall cage, your bird could be above you when he is out and sitting on top.  Some birds get kind of bossy when they sit above you.    Another very important aspect of cage size is bar spacing.  Don't get a cage with wide apart bars.  If your bird can get his head through the bars, he can get his head stuck.  The implications of this can be disastrous.    Congratulations on your new companion.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Get the larger one.It will save you wishing you had gotten a bigger one.And will save you the trouble of setting up a new cage again.|`|INCWpGy4aa	LARGE. Please, the bigger you can get the better for the bird. Do not shove it in some cage made for a cockatiel..|`|hZWup7xXaa	a large cage would be best as african greys get quite a nice size. you sould put in some mirrors to as they love mirrors and also ropes and bells but not any that it would be able to swallow. good luck and have fun with your new friend :)|`|Yr4eBnXlaa	http://www.anafricangrey.ca/forum/upload...    The photo (above) is of the cage my Timneh African Grey has for his play/day cage.  It's a Featherland stainless steel cage and one of their large ones (they do make one larger, but this one is big enough :P)    The domed top gives more interior space, and we have since cable tied a large stripped branch to the top and now he loves the top too.  Flat top cages have a lot less interior space than domed tops.  My Grey is in and out of his cage all day, but if you have to leave your Grey at home (while you're at work), it's really important that the inside have as much space as possible for toys, swings, perches, dishes, etc.    Featherland also makes powder coated versions of their cages.  Here's their website link to the cage I bought:  http://www.featherlandproduct.com/produc...    Stainless steel is more expensive, but Featherland's SS prices are very reasonable and they are well built and easy to keep clean.  SS doesn't rust either, so it's the first and last large cage purchase you will have to make for your Grey.    Happy hunting.  :D    EDIT:  Just to clarify, Featherland dome tops are larger because the domed top is added onto their standard cage body.  You can buy, separately, a play top which makes the cage underneath into a 'flat top.'       Other brands of dome top cages that are the same height, width, & depth as flat topped cages, provide less interior space.|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	You should defiantly get a LARGE ONE  the bigger the better no matter what the size of the cage you will still need to let the bird spend allot of time out of the cage the African Grey is one of the smartest parrots its said to be as smart as a fifth grader!!! If you have done your research on the bird you would know please read books and get all the info you can before getting one
YBcB0732aa	Let your cat stay with your friend because 14 weeks is a long time.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Cats like to be settled, if he moves to your friends temporarily, and then back to yours, he may start trying to find his way back to your friends house thinking that it's home. It'll be pretty confusing for him.     I would say it would be better if he can stay at yours and have someone come over each day, but that is a big ask for 14 weeks, and will you be leaving any lighting or heating on for him?    Your other option is the cattery of course, but expensive and may exacerbate his fur pulling problem.    Actually perhaps he may be better off at your friends, but she needs to make certain he doesn't get out - does she have a cat flap for her cat, and would yours use it...?|`|bHcxSUwtaa	why dont you ask your cat?|`|24T71hYjaa	Have your friend care for him.

Cats are more social then people realize, less then a dog but still social, and they will pull / loose fur when lonely as well.  Take a blanket, and favorite toys and something that smells like you for the cat to not get lonely for you as much.  But leaving it alone for 14 weeks even with some day care, would just be mean I think.|`|EJ1KWAPbaa	I believe your cat would be fine.

Your cat needs some contact and 2 1/2 mons is a long time. Second if it is boredom or stress then it may get worst when he is alone, because he will have no one to interact with and being alone and not knowing where you are will probably cause stress.|`|Fot1B738aa	I would say leave him at the near by Vet and ask them if they can feed him and watch over him. I know it is a lot of money but it is better than losing your Cat. Yes like the girl said above, it may go back to your friends house because it thinks it is the new home. Or I would say try taking the cat to your parents house. Or maybe try to find someone that can come to your house daily and check in on him and feed him and give him water, maybe your friend could do that. Leave the cat at your house and let your friend come over and get him attention for the time you are gone.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	I think you are choosing much the best option for your cat and he'll be fine.

8Y3RwMhjaa	If something should happen like someone breaking into your house could let your cats out. Do not take chances get them vaccinations. No matter how we pamper our little ones they have minds of their own and if they decide to go they will find a way out. Trust me. I have seventeen of the little loves. All rescues and all different. One is in my lap as I type, She loves to watch the cursor blink.  Edit: Oh yes We leave the carrier out and the door open all the time. Several of the babies take regular naps in it.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Don't you just hate the get in the carrier thing?  My cat also hates the ride there.  If it is too bad a mild sedative may work.    I believe you are in error about the vaccinations.  Maybe you are thinking about another inoculation?  Check your card or record on this.  You may be tripping for nothing.  The two of them will be company for each other.  Believe me that helps.    Contact the vet before the trips to be assured of what they are going in for.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Most vaccines should be given every three years, not every year.   You are over-vaccinating if you take them in annually!  Read your insurance policy carefully, and see what it says.  There is a difference between being current on vaccines, and getting vaccinated annually.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	All animals need to have their vaccinations. And a vet visit can potentially catch a life threatening disease in animals, or any other minor problems that can be easily corrected.    Not going, in the long run will catch up with you.|`|JLOz9rXNaa	yes you should continue the vaccinations annually. even though there indoor cats there is always a slight risk of infection, and those vaccines protect them from really horrible diseases   for getting them used to traveling leave there carrier out and open in ur home. put a nice comfy towel in it, a dish of favorite food, and a favorite toy. over time, they should get alot more comfortable with it. lets face it, no one likes to go to the doctor ... try and find a vet who realy likes cats, and takes the time to get to know them as indavidulas.|`|80npJDM2aa	my suggestion is get a medium sized carrier... so its easier to squeeze the cat into.  I have a 16 lb cat and its hard to get her into the carrier.  I trap them in a room shut the door, then blanket/burrito wrap the cats with a towel.  make sure their claws are tucked away.  Slide them into the carrier, shut door quickly.  When you transport your cats, I like to buckle the carrier into the seat with the seat belt.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	I cannot speak about insurance but yearly vaccinations are not only unnecessary,they serve no purpose and they can be dangerous   There is no proof that boosters extend the life of the vaccine and may actually shorten the duration. They can also kill or cause major health problems. I recommend the first set of vaccines for kittens and that is it.    I find these stats unreal  http://www.vaclib.org/legal/PetsDying.ht...  and another  http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Farm/...  http://www.holisticat.com/vaccinations.h...  http://www.pgferals.org/info/display?Pag...  http://www.pgferals.org/info/display?Pag...  http://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/pe...|`|Er7x315eaa	Yes, you should definitely keep up on their shots, although I believe they've changed the rules with certain vaccines to where they only need them every other year.  Also, this is going to sound like the craziest think, but a highly-skilled vet recommended this:  if you can't get your cat into a carrier, how about a pillow case?  It can still breathe, but can't see so that helps to keep them calm.  And since it's soft, they won't hurt themselves trying to get out.  I've never tried it (my cats love their kitty carriers) so if you do, let me know if it works!|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	I leave my cat carrier out all the time that way my cats are use to it.

zL1sggpCaa	RAT TERRIERS!!!! :-)    I LOVE mine! She is one that will cuddle with you and then she be really playful when you play with her... she minds pretty well, and will do just about anything for her "cookies". She is about 7 pounds fully grown, but the standard Rat Terrier gets to be about 20 pounds. They come in miniature and toy as well. (I can't remember what one I got, but the dad was about 5 lbs and the mom was about 8 lbs) Ginger (my dog) is about 3 years old now and still playful as can be, but wants to cuddle up right next to you, her favorite spot is when we're relaxing on the couch, she'll spread across my shoulders behind my head and lay her head on my shoulder.    We got the "natural" docked tail and couldn't be happier. She plays with the kids really well - except when she is eating. LOL    About the only down side to a small dog is the amount of times it needs to be let out to go to the bathroom. The smaller the dog, means the smaller the bladder. So, accidents DO happen IF she isn't let out every few hours to take care of business.    She is great to go on with walks and looks great.    Rat Terriers are packed - muscular if you will and don't have problems with fragile bones - which was a selling point for me because we have young children. I originally wanted an Italian Greyhound, but then found out they are a more fragile breed vs. Rat Terriers who are more muscle.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	All puppies have small bladders that they can not fully control, so if you plan on getting a puppy your mom better be ready to deal with accidents in the house. I would suggest you look into Jack Russell Terriers, they are very energetic, they are small, they have short fur (which doesn't mean they don't shed). JRT's can sometimes be a bit hard to obedience train, but with consistency they are quite clever little dogs. Before you decide on any breed make sure you do a lot of research! Check out your local shelter too, your perfect companion just may be there.       http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/  Check out this website.|`|Mu1vMc7Maa	http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/search.htm     are you getting one without telling her in hopes she lets you keep it?|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Maybe its worth waiting until you are older and leave home before getting a dog. I am not saying that to be mean, but it would not be fair to make a dog live in a home where a member of the family can take a dislike to it.     You either love dogs or you don't and if there's anyone in your house that doesn't, the dog will pick up on it and that is stress that no dog deserves.    Sorry, but you should get a dog for the right reasons, not because it fills a list of requirements.|`|sNVLiC4Laa	Because you are looking for a smaller dog, just be aware that smaller dogs cannot hold their bladder as long as larger dogs can, therefore, they have to be walked outside more often.  If you don't have time to do this, I would stay away from the smaller breeds.  Perhaps a mid-size dog would be better for you.  Try this website, it has pictures of all kinds of small dogs, plus it gives you a very nice description of each of them along with personality traits.   There are so many different ones to choose from.  But it may help you find the perfect breed to match up with your household.    www.smalldogbreedsite.com/|`|6RqjxUTnaa	well you need to Look Carefully for a dog that fit's your Needs goto a local animal shelter/pound and find a dog that matches the physical description then ask to take it out ask them all the qUESTION YOU ASKED HERE about the bladder ask about it's past ,and such.

If you are looking for a pure breed, than you would have to know what you are looking for first so you can go to a pure breed rescue.      http://www.weeno.com/art/0499/35.html  |`|mXRKdmjLaa	A teacup yorkie, I have one and it was very easy to train. Potty training went very well, all we had to do was put out little puppy pads that you can find at wal-mart, and put them on the floor wherever you want them to go to the restroom. It is energetic, it plays frisbee and is very well trained. Good luck!|`|AxYftL4caa	If you get a dog you both think is cute your going to have to train it to be good nd be nice to it. dogs know when someone in the house doesnt like him/her. so if you get a dog treat it well nd play with it to make him/her energetic.|`|A9qDWpXUaa	I agree with Gree. This is something you need to be doing with you Mum. Either go to the book store and get a book on dog breeds to look through together to give you an idea of the different breeds and their needs this will also give you some idea of character traits to be expected in crossbreeds which most shelters have. But if it is a specific breed you want then you would have to get in touch with the Kennel Club who will give you information on Breed Rescue Organizations. Again you need to go with your Mum and choose together. If your Mum is not on board or interested this will only end in tears both for you and the dog.
4CuxzUioaa	it probably has worms. you can buy a dewormer for reptiles at a pet. a vet can do it too but i find you can starve your turtle for 2 days and put the worm ex in guppies or gold fish and get him to eat it that way.. anyway just look into it. he'll be fine if you can get rid of the worms. they have slow metabolizms so the worms will eventualy cause him to starve to death.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Oh, for Pete's sake!

They most definitely would be able to take the remaining portion off. it'd be just like removing a whole leg, just less.

3sB49YNnaa	First things first.  Get the male out of the group cage so he doesn't breed the sows after they litter.  They come into heat within 8 hours or so after giving birth!    The sows will be fine together.  That is what happens in the wild.  No need to worry about them harming the baby, in fact, they often help with it.    Make sure that they all have 18% protein guinea pig pellets with stabilized vitamin C, good grass hay, plenty of water and fresh greens.  The baby will nurse for anywhere from a week to 3 weeks and start to eat pellets within 12-24 hours after birth.      Make sure that you get all the boar pups out by the time they are 3 weeks old since they start to get big ideas at about a month and some of them can do something about it by then!    PS   I want to clear up the "clear up".  It is exceedingly rare for a boar to harm a pup.  In colony breeding cages, the boar is present all the time and there are essentially no problems.  I am recommending removing the boar for the sake of the sows not the pups|`|JsBb732Maa	The males do not have to be removed from the family, they are not dangerous to the babies. They Moms will nurse them and in a few days the babies will start to eat Guinea pig food.You may have to get a bigger cage for the group. Have fun with them, guinea pigs are so cute! Make sure you are feeding guinea pig food, they need the added vitamin C in guinea pig food.|`|RjyNInW6aa	take all the other piggies out of the cage. Leave the mom in there with the baby. Put food in there for the mom. If you don't have any more cages put each guinea pig in a separate card board box. Make sure you leave the mom in the cage with the baby. When you are separating them expect biting from the mom. Don't touch the mom! The mom willl have the most blood on her. i know that sounds disgusting but you have to pick them all up. Plus the mom normally is more fiesty. The baby will be fine as long as you find out who the mom is. Check the nipples too and the one that produces milk is the mom. Don't touch the baby. Mom might not take care of her. hope this helps. Just stay calm and try to find out who the mom is!    thank heaven you have the boy. you are gonna have to monitor the girls. Which ever the baby suckles from should be the mom. I feel so bad for you. You have to sell all the babies. You might want to get more cages today so you can seperate them.  The mom shouldn't be pregnant. iwish you luck!|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Nothing to worry about since they were all together before the birth. They are social animals and they know how to get alone and what to do.   You do not have to worry about the baby it will nurse and be eating pellets all on it one.    I have seen as much as 8 female guinea pig females in the same large cage together some with babies some with out and they all got along just fine.|`|OxOIhuXEaa	I know you've got lots of good answers. But i just want to clear something up. The father does pose a threat to the baby. My friend bred her guinea pigs and the first time she told me the baby was killed by the father, and they didn't know they had to be seperated before. Always seperate the Father from the baby. Of course not all of them will trample on the babies, but just to be sure
K0uTjeWiaa	You need to clean with an enzyme based cleaner. That is the only thing that works.   Get dr Elseys 'cat attract' litter. It works   Is the peeing more then normal? Is there weight loss? if so, contact me.   What your vet gave doesn't help with the allergies only7 the itching. I am assuming your vet gave a steroid shot (sigh)   You need to stop what is causing this and usually it is food       Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.  http://www.catinfo.org/                                  http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|AFMo3671aa	Grace's answer is perfect, in addition you can put some tiny drops of "eau de javel" (I think in English it is bleach water) in the litter. The smell of chlorine attracts all cats. It is even so that if you clean anything with it  the cat  pees where you used it. As as the rest of your apartment is concerned try to put a few drop of essential oil where your cat pees, you'll have to find out  which one she does not like (mine  hate mint, geranium  and salvia). These drops of essential oil will not harm your baby but the cat will not like it.  When my son was very small, our cat peed also everywhere because it was jealous of the baby. I take all the measures above and it went  better, it stopped completely when my son  started to walk, I guess the cat did not consider my son as a competitor once he walked like  us.|`|JLOz9rXNaa	takeing her to the vet is a good idea.      1. pick a room with a door that you can close. and that she has not peed in.  2. put a fresh clean litter box, a food she really likes, and fresh water, in that room.  3. take her in the room with you, and close the door behind you, play with her, scrich her and any thing else that makes her happy and comfortable.   4. DO NOT SHOW HER THE LITTER BOX! LET HER FIND IT HERSELF!  5. keep her in the room, for 2 - 3 days feeding her favorite foods, going in to play and give affection frequently, and make shure to clean the litter box as soon as she uses it.  this method has worked for me several times.  good luck!|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	1. If the urine is recent, blot up as much of it as you can using paper towels or a sponge. Apply plenty of pressure to reach the dampness deep down. Stand on the paper towels for more pressure if necessary. If you own a wet/dry vacuum cleaner extract as much of the moisture as you can. If the urine has dried proceed to step two.   2. Mix a solution of 50% vinegar and 50% water in a jug or other container. Pour a small amount of this solution over the area of cat urine. I used about 50mls. Then begin blotting as described above to soak up this solution.       3. Sprinkle a good handful of baking soda over the stain.     4. Mix a quarter of a cup of hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon of dishwashing detergent and drizzle it over the area where you have sprinkled the baking powder and work it in using your fingers (wear rubber gloves) or a brush. Leave it to work for 15 minutes then begin blotting again.|`|q9qWHXcLaa	I would put your son in a different room while you do this but try this product it's great I couldn't believe my nose|`|6cfb6cd3197d1e471020aecf96fc5902aa	Put her in a room with linoleum and her litter box and shut the door.  Possibly turn the radio up till she figures out your not gonna let her out.  Make sure she has food and water and than go online and try to find something that will break down the proteins in the urine.  Thats the only way to get rid of the smell.  Cat urine is kinda permanent.
t4x3tr3Qaa	There  are  a lot of  answers  to this  question..  there  are  a lot  of  fish  that  will keep the  gup  population  down..  but before  I list a few  might I  suggest  that  maybe  you list them on  craigslist  or  freecycle.com  or  on  some ANY other  site...   pass them  either  free or  with homing  fee  to  others  that  might be interested in  some of  your gups..   a puffer  would  do the  gups a good pop  control but  would  also have a field  day on  your  angelfish's  fins . most  any  cichlid - (not the  parrots  because  they  have  odd mouths  and bodies  and  are  generally unable  to  hunt  well)  would  have  a field  day  eating  gups.   of  course  avoid  Oscars  as  they  get  way  too  large      Ken|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Your parrot cichlids won't eat the guppies? I'm surprised at that. Anyhow, yes, of course, there are many fish that will eat guppies. How you get them to stop when you decide there are few enough guppies is another question.    A couple of interesting ones: The Amazon Leaf Fish. The Pike Livebearer (Belinesox belizanus).|`|mnufOa6eaa	Umm, that makes no sense. All fish, no matter their size, will feed on baby fish. Even the guppies themselves and the parrot fish should be eating the fry.     If I were you I'd just seperate the males and females so they can't keep breeding. Buy a smaller tank to put the males or females in. That's my suggestion.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	You could rehome them. Once the guppies are about 2 months old, they are old enough to go to a new place without becoming too stressed out. Rehome them on Craigslist for any amount you choose. Just remember the better the deal the sooner they're gone. I rehomed 8 guppies for a dollar each. You could charge more, but if they are babies I would rehome them for $5 a group. You could also rehome the females and keep the males.    Just getting fish to eat other fish is a bit pointless. Solve the problem by rehoming. People always want guppies.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	You can easily add another angel or even 3 more in your tank.  You could also go with some smaller S. American cichlids.

You can also keep algae down by doing regular water changes as each water change introduces new water and will kill off the nutrients needed for algae to grow.|`|8owlj2xHaa	I am not a fan of adding fish to help with symptoms. What happens when the algae is gone? Now you are feeding algae to keep them alive, or not.  If your tank is a few years old you are most likely having phosphate problems. Phosphate builds up over time and can be absorbed by substrate and any rocks. You can try changing out the substrate, and or run a phosphorus remover. Reef keepers run phos remover constantly, it is more a sponge than a chemical treatment.  Phosphorus is the number food choice of algae!  How about your bulbs and length of time they are on. Florescents should be changed every 6 months and do not leave lights on for more than 12 hours|`|7HEZhx46aa	Get at least one Chinese algae eater, depending on the size of your tank.

The system will kill algae and bacteria and make for a healthier tank.|`|F3xZ80O9aa	Get one of those fish that eat that stuff|`|OsVswissaa	It really depends on the algae.  Spot algae won't be eaten by anything, hair or brush algae needs shrimp, etc.  Rather than messing with your fish population you're better off adjusting the light, nutrient, and plant levels.  You don't want to get an "algae eater" that doesn't like the kind of algae you have.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	Loaches eat very little algae.  They are bottom scavengers like Cory's and clean the bottom of the tank of leftover food but not algae eaters.    Otto's and Siamese Algae eaters are but if you don't have plants, you should not need an algae eater.    If your tank has been set up within the past 3 months, the brown algae you may be seeing is Diatoms.  This is normal in newly set up tanks and will go away within 3-4 months.  It is increased by overfeeding which causes more phosphates=more diatoms.    Control the overfeeding and do regular weekly water changes and you will hold those phosphates in check but do not overfeed your fish, as well.    Clean the glass with paper towel and manually remove as much algae as you can.  Do not use chemicals.
MstjbpVJaa	Swans are very aggressive at any time more so in the breeding season and prior,when they are pairing, Humans and Animals should always keep away from them,they may seem docile and friendly but always beware! they are a Wild thing.  I have witnessed a Swan Killing a Dog and there was nothing that could be done to stop it,the dog was pulled into the lake and drowned,so keep your dog away.  If you have found an injured Swan your safest bet is to notify the R.S.P.C.A.or local rescue centre in some areas the local Police have a Wildlife Officer,who will always be willing to give assistance,some vets will even help.  Rescue centres always release them back to where they came from unless their injuries are too serious.|`|xGmbEzOZaa	Swans can be extremely territorial, especially if it's the breeding season and they have eggs or chicks. If threatened, a swan wouldn't resist attacking a human.    If the bird is injured, I guess it depends on the individual bird on how close it would let a human go near it. Perhaps if it was seriously injured, it wouldn't have the strength to attack.
Um8osMNuaa	Until your pup is fully vaccinated he is at risk from many life threatening diseases such as parvo and distemper etc. he can come into contact with the germs from being with dogs that are not vaccinated, he can also pick them up off the ground. So until he is vaccinated you need to keep him away from other dogs and places where they have been.    Your vet will have meant for him to be around other people and any dogs that you personally know, that are vaccinated and so pose no threat to your pup.  lf you have  friends with dogs, then invite them round and let them play with your pup in the safety of your home. Your garden is fine for the pup to go in as no strange dogs would have been there.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Yes, he is too young to be going outside at 5 weeks old, even too young to be seperate from his mother, he is not full weaned away from mothers milk. puppies are old enough to be seperated from their mother unit at 8 weeks old.

Being this young your pup hasn't had any vaccinations yet and is susceptible to parvo, distemper, and many other diseases that could kill him.  When he's 6 weeks old he'll get his first shots.  You'll need to wait til at least the second set (at 9 wks) before the innoculations kick in and can protect him.  He can see people at 6 weeks while outside (as long as you hold him) or if they come into your home.  No dog meetings until 9 weeks and no outside time (other than in your own backyard) until 9 weeks.  There are many diseases, viruses, worms, in the grass and on other dogs that you won't know about but your dog can catch.    Bring people to your home. Meet people on your porch or in your yard.  He'll be fine til he's older.  Socialization is definitely needed but at the right time so he won't get sick and die.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Well, puppies need to have all their injections to protect them against disease. There is one in particular called Parvovirus that can kill a dog within days/even hours and is a very painful, uncomfortable death that is almost impossible to treat. This is why your puppy should not go out until its had its jabs.    Saying that, Parvo virus is transmitted through fecal matter, so in order to socialise your puppy if you don't want to wait I would follow these rules:-    Don't put him down anywhere other than your house and garden    Make sure he is warm enough    Don't take him to places frequented by other dogs (as there are many viruses other than parvo that he can pick up) and he can socialise with dogs after his jabs    Don't let people fuss him, you don't know if they have dogs or not and 5 weeks is very young in terms of his natural defences. I know people will want to, but the object of getting him out and about is to get him used to all the sights and sounds. The fussing and petting can come later.    Don't take him out for too long.     When the puppy is 12 weeks old and has had his jabs, get yourselves in a puppy class and training classes and he will socialise that way with no problems. It won't be too late. Until then, only take him out if you can follow the advice above, otherwise, keep him inside with you and let him be a young pup.    Good luck and ask your vet if you have any questions about the advice he gives.|`|kfyDRQFSaa	Just ee careful.  You should not go into something that requires 'alot' of responsibility so blind folded.  Why is he not with his mother and siblings?  Read this below before doing anything else.    Young animals are very susceptible to disease before their immune systems have had a chance to become effective. Very young puppies acquire some immunity from their mothers, which protects them during the early weeks. This fades over time and needs to be replaced by immunity stimulated by vaccinations.     Since keeping a puppy isolated until it has developed full immunity can ruin its future character, a compromise must be reached between the need to protect against disease, and the need to ensure good mental health.     As most of the socialisation will be with humans rather than other dogs, such a compromise is feasible and, if the following guidelines are adhered to, it is possible to socialise your puppy and avoid the risk of infection.    Until your puppy is fully protected by vaccination it should:    not be allowed to mix with dogs of unknown vaccination status.    not be taken to parks or walked in other areas which other dogs have fouled     be taken out and about often in non-doggy areas, carrying if necessary to avoid contact with other dogs or soiled areas    Worms and children    Ask your veterinary surgeon for an effective worming medication (e.g. Panacur) or continue with the programme that was already started at the place from which your puppy was obtained.     Do not allow your puppy to lick childrens faces, particularly their mouths, encourage children to wash their hands after playing with your puppy, and pick up and dispose of faeces regularly.    Giving your puppy an education    As well as socialising and training, it is essential that you teach your puppy how to behave. If you socialise your puppy well, he should be friendly and eager to meet people and other animals.     Control some of the exuberance that comes with this and you will have found the perfect balance of friendliness and politeness.

Some will be a bit smaller (down to about 70 pounds) and some will be larger.  500 pounds would be unusual, though still within the realm of possibility.|`|2fxziuIyaa	yeh they can get quite big and become quite destructive/aggressive..esp if if kept in house/small yard..they need lots of space!! they get real fat and can be as big as a colllie dog

4sDaBXAjaa	You should look for a complete feed, maybe a pellet with some sweet. I find the sweet feed rots their teeth faster & it's not super nutritious, so I did some research. Strategy (Purina) is a great feed, but my horse wouldn't eat it because it was too plain. I prefer Nutrina's XTN feed or Seminole's Wellness Show & Sport, both feeds have supplements that people spend a lot of money on separately. Ask your local feed store what they recommend, and check out the feed online. When I switched to the Seminole I called their hotline and they helped me pick out the feed that would be best for my horse.|`|D5RyA4gtaa	Pelleted feed is ground up sweet feed.  Feed companies will tell you they did that mainly to please people not horses.  Pellets also are very dusty and can cause allergies.  Your horse needs to be fed at least twice a day.  And if she is not being worked hard 10% protein is enough.  Moderate work 12% protein.  We use the large coffee can which is about 3 lbs. 2X daily.  It is best if you can weigh your feed.  Look on the bag of feed and it will give you the lbs. she should be fed daily for that particular feed.  If she is 3 yrs. old 750 lb. is not much, depends on what kind of horse she is but most regular size horses should weigh about 1000 to 1150 lbs.
kWwgWSSgaa	A well bred Rottweiler, in responsible hands, is an asset to a family. They are good with children; a combination of *protector* {unless professionally trained may only bark an alarm & will not reliably attack on command} & playmate.     However, THEY ARE NOT FOR EVERYONE.     Owning any dog involves certain responsibilities and this is particularly true of a large breed dog.    YOU AS A ROTTWEILER OWNER, HAVE THE OBLIGATION OF CARING FOR AND CONTROLLING A DOG WHO IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE STRONGER THAN YOU ARE.     Unless you take this responsibility very seriously and are willing to put the time, energy and thought needed into raising your dog properly, your Rottweiler will be a burden instead of a joy.     Some questions you should ask yourself before you buy the puppy.    Am I willing to give my dog regular discipline and basic obedience training?     Any dog, and especially a large muscular dog, needs regular day-to-day discipline. It dog must grow up knowing that he has limits of behaviour, that he must respect people and property, and this he is, after all, a dog.     Will I see to it that both the children and the dog trea|`|PMksnqkxaa	The American Pit Bull Terrier is NOT a guard dog, actually the total opposite. They are big babies. They are great with kids if properly socialized with them.  Rottweilers can be great guard dogs because they were bred to do this. They are very protective and also can be good with kids if properly socialized.  I would probably choose a APBT over a rottweiler because of the size of the dogs, The APBT is a medium sized dog which will be less likely to hurt your child and knock her over while a rottweiler if it got excited could easily knock your daughter over in 2 seconds and not mean to do it.    I would wait it off and only get one dog, It is much harder to train two dogs/puppies.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Before you decide call the dog by its real why dontcha. Its American Pitbull terrier or APBT or pitbull terrier. pitbull by itself is a bad given name to most of the bully breeds to attempt to discriminate against them, most people dont even know that fact.     Pitbull terriers are lovely dog contrary to the stupid brainwashed people that believe they are born nasty. They are not born nasty but will protect their owners. They are not dog aggressive by nature but that is bred into them by bad owners who know nothing of genetics or breeding a sound dog.     Sure you can train a rottweiler and a pitbull terrier to live together, just get them from good breeders that clearly states that they dont promote dog fighting.|`|0MunIx8raa	You know this is not a good idea.  Your 2 year old will be a great meal for one of those.  BUT if you must have one, I would say the Rotti.  Or how about a Doberman?  Those are excellent dogs even though they have a bad wrap.  I would not personally get a Rotti or a Pit.  Dobermans are loyal and good with children and very protective.  Not to mention very intimidating looking.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	A Pits nature is generally too friendly to be any type of guard dog, however, they are far better around childern.    Both need special training to be a guard dog, however.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Yes you can raise both together and have them be obedient, however i am concered that you seem to think EITHER dog will "guard and protect" you.    The only GOOD guard dog is a properly trained one: and by properly trained i mean trained by a professional in the field. Most dogs (yes, even those with guarding instincts that were bred for the job) will not know what to do or how to react in any type of guarding/protecting situation. That has to be TAUGHT.    Instincts make up very little of a guard dog - proper training takes care of the rest. Home training is not an option becuase YOU are not experienced in reading dog body language OR any type of training (let alone guard/protection training.) Home trained dogs are NOT safe to have around anyone, let alone a child.    There is a lot more to guarding/protection than barking or showing teeth - a dog has to know how to react, when to react, how to back of, the proper way to bite if needed, when to let go, etc. Again, this all needs to be taught! By a professional, unless you want the dog to attack your family....    On that note, a Rottie is better for this type of work than a Pit. pits are naturally DOG or ANIMAL aggressive but were never really bred to do guard type work. They were bred to be loyal to their masters and gentle to people. Yes they will probably bark, but they do not generally do any protection/guarding work.|`|QOITXwDIaa	Rotti's are better guard dogs (pits are generally too friendly to be a guard dog) but pits are better with children.      What level of protection do you actually need?    Yes you can raise them together as long as you raise them correctly and actually train them and get them neutered, etc.|`|A21SswSfaa	Neither of these dogs will be good guard dogs without special training. Guard dogs are specially chosen and raised. I suggest if you want security you get a security system.     Do your research for both dog breeds. Both are wonderful dogs, but they need experienced dog owners. Go to the animal shelter or a breed rescue and find a nice pet that does well with children. And, yes, with the right training both breeds should get along fine together.|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	Pitbull. If you raise them right.. they are only aggressive towards anyone they sense dangerous, and are very protective over their close ones.    Rots are also very good dogs.. but they are pretty big. A lot bigger than your 2 year old daughter. Pitts are medium sized dogs.     If you raise the two dogs together as puppies, then they should get along fine. |`|P2yRAWiJaa	Pitbulls are probably better with kids than a Rott.  Not saying Rotts aren't good, just that Pitts are a little better. :)    A pitbull is bred to be loyal, great with kids/family, obedient and can guard.  I wouldn't suggest keeping any other dog with a pitbull unless they can grow up together as puppies.  Pitbulls are notorious for being dog aggressive (at least to some degree, depends on the dog sometimes).  They are NEVER people aggressive.  Wary around strangers if taught to guard, but not aggressive.|`|s8P8C92zaa	I think any dog can be good around the kids it's raised with. My mother in law has 2 rottis, they are exceptional around all children. Though very big when indoors, accidentally knocking stuff and sometimes the kids over...My boxer has a little pit in her, (but still reg. as a boxer...weird) But she is fantastic around kids, she is actually better then the lab.  Also very protective of the kids, without any special training, its just her nature.  Either dog will be good w/ kids if they are raised together, and can be protective if they sense danger.  You can rasie rotti & pit together if you get them both as pups|`|TjHIggZHaa	Just my personal opinion here. Both are very good choices if you know how to raise a large breed dog. They can both be very bad choices if you don't.    Getting a large breed pup while your child is so small may also be a bad idea. It can take a little time to teach a dog to be calm and gentle. Knock downs can be harmful to the child and the child-dog relationship. As well as eye poking and tail pulling. It can work but it will require some extra effort from you.    I would suggest you wait until the child is a little older.|`|MauSHQGRaa	Neither dog for you. If you have to come on this forum and ask this kind of question, then apparently you did not do your homework and conduct the proper research on both breeds of dogs you are asking about.     It sounds like you have no knowledge of these breeds and the only thing you would wind up with is an unsocialized, under-trained, out of control dog on your hands, or yet a dog that shows no signs of aggression and "guarding" and you wind up dumping them because they did not meet up tp your expectations.     Neither dog was originally bred to guard. Rotties are a working breed, originally used to help farmers in Germany. A very powerful dog that in the wrong hands can be dangerous, and people wonder why they have a bad rap....    Please invest in an alarm system, this is your best guard measure. And don't get a dog until you research the breed and know exactly if this is what you want and can handle the responsibility. Stop listening to media hype and what you think is the truth about these dogs. Educate yourself first, then eventually you will be able to educate others on the breeds you chosen.|`|BVzJqvxvaa	Well as far as family protection they both are very good. The main difference you would have to worry about is the amount of energy a pitbull has compared to a rotti. They need ALOT of exercise, but they are both working class dogs.Pits just tend to be more energetic. Especially if you raise them both from pups there shouldn't be a problem having both. If they is an age difference i hope they are both socialized well with animals. Also if they arent raised together you may have to look out for jealousy. It really depends on the level of the trainer. These are powerful breeds but they are also my favorites along with the american bulldog.|`|wG181Cpxaa	They are both great animals to trust with kids, as long as you raise them to be used to kids. They can both be very protective. Rotties tend to be more protective of kids (this is just in my experience).     I guess it just comes down to personal choice. Try looking at humane societies first.    And remember, if you leave a dog on a lead outside, it could become aggressive if left out too long and often.    Hope this helps.|`|794ac658d1eaa69ada3e05bd84e09a38aa	those dogs are dangerous,especially the pitbulls they are fighting dog not house dogs,u have heard the news about the pitbulls that have bitten or killed ppl...plus you have a @yr old baby girl......in my opinion i think you shouldn't get either dog....get the one that ur daughter wants......

If not get him to the vet. It'll help.  Try vinegar, avoid anything with ammonia in it.|`|AFMo3671aa	The only way to solve the problem is to have him neutered. One thing, do not use bleach to clean because cats love the smell of chlorine and certainly will pee or  spray where you put it. Lots of cats do not like the smell of salvia  or mint or  geranium. Try it out with your cat, if he runs away when you put the bottle under his nose, you have found the product that will keep him off  the place you don't want he goes to. I put once and a while some tiny drops  of  essential  oils of  salvia (that's the one my cat cannot stand) where I do not want the cat goes - you can find these products in the pharmacy. However, the first step is to have him neutered. Good luck.|`|AA12149303	Get him fixed.|`|q9qWHXcLaa	try this it works great!|`|vnPaVS1baa	Kill the cat.

If the urine is recent, blot up as much of it as you can using paper towels or a sponge. Apply plenty of pressure to reach the dampness deep down. Stand on the paper towels for more pressure if necessary. If you own a wet/dry vacuum cleaner extract as much of the moisture as you can. If the urine has dried proceed to step two.   2. Mix a solution of 50% vinegar and 50% water in a jug or other container. Pour a small amount of this solution over the area of cat urine. I used about 50mls. Then begin blotting as described above to soak up this solution.       3. Sprinkle a good handful of baking soda over the stain.     4. Mix a quarter of a cup of hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon of dishwashing detergent and drizzle it over the area where you have sprinkled the baking powder and work it in using your fingers (wear rubber gloves) or a brush. Leave it to work for 15 minutes then begin blotting again.|`|fd101293d068eac0ce04b5b4859d1afdaa	well if its on carpet you can put baking soda all over it i mean cake it in baking soda and let it sit over night then vaccum it up in the morning and then use regualr carpet cleaners or deoderizers.

hZWup7xXaa	my yorkie use to do this to my german shepherd. i think toby is doing this 1) because he feels he has to protect you 2) he has to show this new dog what is his. you just need to keep them together alot but keeping an eye on them, keep patting them both at the same time, feed them at the same time and play with them at the same time. toby needs to know that this new dog is not going to take over. i dont think you should use a muzzle or a cage on toby as this would be like a punishment to him and it would just make him more upset around this new puppy. i dont think a professional would be able to do much either. just try not to punish toby as it makes him more upset. it will take time. good luck and fave fun with your puppies :)|`|nl5JOu43aa	Yorkies think they are big dogs,they don't realize they're small and will charge any dog regardless of size,getting him fixed will help,and you need to teach him YOU are the boss.yorkies are hyper and strong minded you just have to keep working with him they are very smart and catch on quick.|`|HvFIHu3saa	GET RID OF THAT DAMN LITTLE RAT OR ONE DAY YOUR PIT WILL USE HIM FOR A CHEW TOY.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Ignore durdenslabs, she knows only what the media has spoon fed her and knows nothing really relevant about the breed.

That's one BIG Yorkie or one small pit!!!    If your Yorkie keeps attacking your Pit, eventually the Pit will fight back and kill your Yorkie.  Pits are known for their dog aggression - so be prepared.    If you can't get your Yorkie under control and you don't want it dead, or don't want to get rid of it, then you do need a pro.
BEvzXXVfaa	My 9 month old kitty also has a case of bad breath.... when we took him to the vet, she told us that it's because he is still teething.  Once all his teeth come in, he should no longer have that stinky breath.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Pets have bad breath just like humans and need to have their tongue cleaned just like humans.|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	How is her oral health? If she has a lot of tartar on her teeth she needs to be taken to a veterinarian for a dental. Some cats have problems with their mouths and need to have some of their removed. In case that worries you, cats can do just fine without having any teeth. The kibbles they eat are small enough that some cats who have all of their teeth don't even bother chewing it, they just swallow. No choking, no nothing.     Once her teeth are cleaned, her breath will smell better. You may have to do some teeth cleaning on her at home as plaque acculmulates all the time and will eventually mineralize into tartar if not removed. My small animal veterinary medical nursing teacher thinks that some cats may have an over-reaction to the tartar in their mouths because she's removed teeth from red and swollen kitty mouths and once the offending teeth were gone the gums returned to normal.|`|Q87djE0laa	if you feed her wet food change it to -1kitten food (go cat) they are alot better than wet food and better for her teeth|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	It could be worms.

"Because most pet owners do not brush their pets teeth every day, pets are susceptible to gingivitis, a condition which is the result of plaque build-up on the teeth.

If your government has a public health service, I would give them a call.    Rabies shots for people are very expensive, so it is not taken lightly.

ak9DrBSwaa	Technically, they'd be gravid (with eggs) and not pregnant.    Zebra Danios (leopard danios are a colour morph of these) are EASY to breed.  They'll pretty much start spawning anytime you turn on the light or do a water change! The trick is keeping them from eating their eggs is you want them to survive. If you have a spare tank and want to do this just look up "breeding zebra danios".    EDIT  -Not sure why folks are saying its hard to get them to spawn = my guess is they ARE spawning and eating their eggs.    quotes from the websites below  "one of the easiest fish to breed"  "danios are the aquatic equivilant of bunnies"  http://www.fishdeals.com/cyprinids/danio...  http://www.aquariacentral.com/articles/z...    Personal note - ours breed without intervention in a 16 gallon river tank and a 55 gallon tank. We've also purposely breed them in a 10 gallon. You definetly do not need "an outdoor heated pool".|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Leopard danios are classic egglayers, so they can't get pregnant. They may be ready to lay eggs, though. Do a web search on "breeding danios" and "zebra danios breeding" (zebras and leopards are pretty much the same fish with different color patterns) for more information on how they breed.    They are usually considered one of the easier egg-laying fishes to breed.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	I guess it is possible, but it is extremely unlikely. It is VERY hard to breed danios ant requires very large amounts of space and a lot of other conditions have to be almost perfect. I've only ever known of one person who successfully breed danios and he used an outdoor heated pool, and the ph has to be exact.|`|mnufOa6eaa	NO! Danios lay eggs, therefore can not be "pregnant". And you can not spawn them without doing lots of research as they are not an easy fish to breed.     They probably just ate too much or if their scales are protruding from their body and they look like pine cones when viewed from the top, they have dropsy.    Sorry, but they are hard to spawn. If your's are easy, you're very lucky. Danios aren't disguishable from the sexing point of it, so it's always possibly you have all males or all females. Everything I have read says you have to have the right conditions to get dainos to breed, just like Betta's. If they are easy to breed, it's usually just a fluke. Livebearers are easy to breed, but not egg layers. I have some danios right now and they haven't once spawned. I also had them in the past and they didn't spawn then either.
b507bd2f18895981c04569e161402638aa	My Chi is now a year old: and the wee-wee pads worked for me. It is too cold in NJ for him to go outside all the time to handle his biz, but to start off...after eating, sleeping or playing he will start to sniff around. Place him in the center of the pad and DO NOT allow him off of it until he actually goes. He will try to get pass you over and over, but pick him right back up and into the center. My chi got it after a month or so and I started this at 8 weeks also. He is now trained and knows where NOT to poo/pee. Good luck|`|DUzFgnu4aa	I had the same problem with my maltese but here's what I can tell you.    You need to get him a cage that is very small at first. something he can only stand up and turn around in, nothing bigger.   This will teach him not to pee in his cage because he will have to sit in it. It sounds mean but it's really not, I called a dog trainer and this is what he told me.    Only do that for a week or until he stops, which I promise he will very soon.     After that point you can move him into a larger cage and he will not use the bathroom inside.    When he's out you can do a couple of things. First you can keep him very close to you, on a leash or just make sure he is always with you. This will teach him to stay close to you, making it easy to watch him.    You also need to create a schedual, set times for him to go out. He will learn when these times are and if he knows he's going out in just a few minutes he will hold it i promise.    Try this and I hope it helps.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Well first of all just leaving him outside and "hoping" he goes is not actually training him to understand what exactly the outside is for, right now he's learning that the outside is for playing all day and NOT for pottying, does that make sense?  If a dog is not shown what to do they will never learn it on their own.  So if you aren't outside, saying go potty and then praising and rewarding him when he does potty I'm afraid he'll never learn to housebreak and will continue using your house as his toilet.    You must put him on a schedule, while a dog can hold it in hours their age in months a Chihuahua has such a tiny bladder that you have to get them outside literally every hour on the hour.  Take him outside and say go potty and it's usually best if you walk them around on leash so they don't just spend all their time sniffing and playing when he squats to pee you need to praise say good potty and then give him a treat - sliced cooked hot dog works well.  Everytime he potties outside you must always acknowledge with praise and reward, this is how a dog learns what pleases you.  If he potties in the house you must ignore this behavior and clean it up really well.  When he doesn't get reinforced for pottying in the house he'll learn that inside = no attention and will stop doing it.  Now if he has an accident it is your fault, either you didn't get him outside soon enough or you weren't paying attention to him.  Dogs won't automatically notify you that they need to go outside so you must set a timer to remind yourself to take him out and that includes during the night.    Do not feed after 5 pm and pick up his water around 6 pm and make sure he gets outside a lot before bedtime then he should really only require one trip outside during the night.    Until he's much older he won't signal you that he needs to go out until he's learned that the outside is for pottying, right now he's going in the house so why would he wake you?    You must be patient and you must be consistent with your training.  So right now the way you are going he'll never learn.    Good luck    ADD:  FYI training your dog to use potty pads in the house only trains them that the house is their toilet, if you want to stop him from pottying in the house then you need to get him outside enough to be successful.  Only use pads when you have to go out and cannot be there to let him outside, NEVER train him to use them or you'll just confuse him with mixed training methods.|`|3JLg1tcRaa	My mom has a chihuahua which she got when she was about 11 weeks.  She buys potty training pads for her (shes now 2) and she put them in a corner of the house, and every time the dog went to the bathroom, you move the poop to the pad... so they can see that it's the correct place to use the bathroom.  She now only goes on the pad of course after so much training...  but keep in mind, 8 weeks is still very young, and harder to train, so just keep up the persistence and go to a dog store and buy some training potty mats for him.|`|mXRKdmjLaa	Go to wal-mart, in the pet aisle or whatever, get the potty training pads for dogs/puppies. Put them wherever you want them to potty, then when you see them sniffing around the room, take him and put him on the pad. If you do this for a while then he will learn that the potty pad is where he needs to go. It worked very well with my chihuahua. I hoped I helped! Good luck!|`|ff2a5c95ae4646ec6731e853b52c45d4aa	I'm not an expert on chihuahua's but the best way to train most puppies is to be diligent about taking them outside a few minutes after eating and drinking. That means every time. Hard, I know, but will pay off in the end.  Once they have done the job, praise them and take them back inside.     It's hard when you work and have to leave them in a kennel, but when you are home, stick with it and before long he will get the idea.  Good luck and enjoy!|`|sayFpMdJaa	well you could start juss giving him little treats if he goes outside..but if he goes inside you could start just spanking him ( a little bit!) and if you have any other dogs around they could sorta have them teach him/her to go outside.  if all else fails then you could start using the diapers that they have..and are super cute :)
gz5O9Tbpaa	Well, I can tell you right off the bat you cant have him anywhere that sells food. This means that you cant take him into the store part of the walmart because they sell food on the other side. There is a Lowes here that allows animals into their store. They have a partnership with the PetSmart and the trains would meet us there to socialize our dogs to strangers. And the Lowes loved it so they continued the dog thing. Most Co-ops will allow dogs. And there is a wine store my hubby and I frequent that allows me to bring my dog. I had him with me when we stopped by there one Saturday and I asked if I could bring him in. I carried him the whole time though.     I know that we think of our dogs as part of the family, but we have to remember that they are dogs! Animals. And that's how many people will see them. So just ask, but dont be offended with they say no. It's their store. It's their rules. But I think you will be surprised at how many people say yes.|`|AA12128656	my dogs go to pet store, park, farmers market (outdoors) flea markets, dog-friendly beach.    everywhere in my car too. there's always at least 2 or 3 in there|`|zL1sggpCaa	Well, my Mom takes her to most places and has a carrier for her and everything.    You have the two places that are no-no's down... but just use common sense for the rest...     I wouldn't suggest bringing a dog into a clothing store or anything like that, places that serve food or of course a "no dogs allowed" place...    I've seen people who bring their dog every where, just leave them in the car if they aren't going to be too long, like at the grocery store and such.|`|wqL84O8Naa	you can take them to pet stores, outdoor parks, the vet and that's about it|`|5dDNqwlzaa	You shouldn't carry your dog around with you every time you leave the house, they'll grow very attached and develop separation anxiety, which is not fun at all.  Instead, cage your dog every time you go to run errands, so when you do want to leave the house for work, going out with friends, etc. it will not expect to come along and go ballistic when it doesn't.    EDIT:    Please don't cart your dog around in a carrier all day into stores, etc. dogs do not like it and it is extremely rude to others.  Sure, store managers won't ask you to leave, but have some respect for other people.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	Here we can take our dogs into pet stores. We have places like Petsmart, Petco, Aslin-Finch, and Big R, they all allow pets. Also Home Depot allows pets. I was surprised to find that one out back when my dog was a pup and I wanted to socolize him. I have also known people to bring thier small pets into Wal mart. I hope some of these help. Have fun with your guy.|`|q0vKbocHaa	somewhere like petco or somethng, you could bring it into a grocery store (like in a doggie bag thingy), but it is kind of rude IMO|`|uTDCTdjMaa	Well.. you know you can take him to doggy day care and let some other people take care off him! But you have a choice leave him at home alone or take him to doggy day care and let him meet new dogs while you run some errands. That's what i do with my dog and i only leave for 1 hour or so!|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Really, the only places it is generally acceptable to bring your dog into are pet stores and those stores clearly marked 'pets welcome'.  Where I live, stores that allow them have a sign at the door stating 'Leashed, well-behaved dogs welcome'.  Most here also have some leashes by the door for use.  But, I do live in an extremely dog-friendly city where most of our locally owned stores allow dogs and even some of the 'big box' store managers allow them, in defiance of their corporate policy.  Non-pet chain stores will not allow your dog in pretty much all locations, some locally owned stores will.  When in doubt, ask before bringing your dog in with you.  Another good resource would be a local dog trainer.  Mine keeps a list of dog-friendly businesses in town that is distributed to class participants and also holds advanced obedience classes in local stores as well.|`|nYv65TlEaa	I had sneaked in 3 puppies in walmart,to buy benedyl ,they had gotten their first shot that day and I bought it just incase...I was out of it,and i didn't want to drop puppies off at home only to go back the same way    But other then the Vets,petsmart,parks,I don't see where else you can  I would never leave my dog outside tied tied while i run in a store,I have gone to a convient store,called amcs,like a 7/11 but I held my dog in my arms|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Pet stores that allow dogs and public sidewalks where you can walk him on a leash. Stores that expressly allow dogs.  That's it unless it is a service dog.    Shops and malls are off-limits.  Our bank gives dog cookies at the drive-through but they aren't allowed in the bank.    The size of the dog does not matter.  Some people are allergic to dogs.  Some people don't like dogs.  Some people are scared of them.  Many small dog owners don't understand that the same rules apply to their dogs as big dogs. My big dogs are extremely well-behaved. Better than many small dogs I see.  But the rules are the same no matter what.  How do you define big and small?  And a terror of a 10 lb dog that barks like crazy is far more obtrusive than a well- behaved 30 lb. dog.    Beatgu - leaving a dog in a car is illegal, a good way to kill your dog in hot weather and can get your dog stolen.
WebaFPgsaa	There both really great! The Chinese water dragon is really good for looks, I think they're a lot better looking than bearded dragon.  But on the other hand, I would say they're more expensive to take care of and they need a bigger cage.  Bearded dragons are really cool! I've heard of people giving them pizza, steak, and other human food...I don't know how healthy it is for them, but I thought I would mention it:) I've also heard of people letting them wander around the house just like a cat. They have a cage for it whenever they leave, and it doesn't need as big of a cage compared to the water dragon. And on top of that, you can sometimes take them out for walks if you get the proper leash for them.    I know a couple of people who used to have bearded dragons, one of them giving theirs away for a water dragon. I would regret that if it were me. Only the brother of the family enjoyed it's stay, while the others missed the bearded dragon.|`|RT4OtkDDaa	Bearded dragons make awesome pets, and are relatively easy to take care of. Haha you can even put a leash on them and they'll 'walk' with you after they get used to it lol. Ive heard that Chinese water dragons like to escape and run away...|`|q9qWHXcLaa	bearded dragons are (this is true) the best lizard you can get they make awesome pets but if you don't want to handle them because they love being on your shoulder and going for walks on your shoulder they are so friendly I had a friend that brought her lizard out to town every day she was like a walking petting zoo she even brought anti bacterial products in cause little kids wanted to pet it but water dragons are fun to wacth in their cage.|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|uvQG3e15aa	First of all do all the research you can about these guys.    If this is your first lizard go with the beardie.     I have both of these fabulous lizards but what you need to know is that they require totally different types of care.    Water dragons need ALOT ALOT of room.At petstores theyre all very tiny BUT they grow up to be 3 feet long. at minimum your going to need an enclosure that is as big as your shower. ( 4 feet by 3 feet by 6 feet high)  they also need really really humid environments. I've placed a humidifier into my tank...   They are also skittish, this is because most of them are wild caught. They are entertaining but need more work and care.     Beardies love interacting with you and are quite active.   So i say choose the beardie.
a29qiNkvaa	I would say it allergies! Allergies can really start showing at 1 /12 TO 2 years old! Neither of my dog show any until 2 and they keep getting worse so I did allergy testing and my female has allergies to just about everything out side including GRASS! So we started her on allergy shots! My male is mainly food allergies my female also has food allergies she cant have anything that has chicken init my make cant have any grains!     I would start with food and see what happens! You said that you put him on a premium food! Can I ask what food?      Ok well this is what I suggest doing change him to a grain free food!     Taste of the wild  EVO   Solid gold- barking at the moon    At first I was shocked by the price but after feeding these food I have found they are cheaper then the cheaper foods! Both of my dogs are 95lb ad I only have to feed them 2 cups a day! At first I felt guilty that I was feed them so much less food I would feed them more and they both put on 10lb in less then a month! So I cut back down to 2 cups and they are maintaining there weights! I pay $60 for a bag of there food but it lasts 3 times longer! I was buying 2 to 3 bags a month of the old stuff at $30 a bag!|`|zL1sggpCaa	Take him to the vet! Could be mange... or it could be allergies... either way, get him checked out ASAP.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	This sounds like what are called Hot Spots.  I would take him to the vet and tell them what is going on.  You can also change vets if you have be rudely treated by your previous vet.  Good Luck.|`|oZ3gU7htaa	If you are sure that your dog is protected against fleas and their bites, there is a medication called Sulfadene made by Hartz that you can find at your supermarket in the pet aisle.  It is for "hot spots", and I used it for years on my dogs.  I understand that some dogs are allergic; so do a test patch first.|`|A9qDWpXUaa	If you feel that the vet treated you in that way then I would find another vet if you can as that was unnecessary.    Your dog does sound to have "hot spots". Some are easily treated by clipping away some of the fur from the area to let air get to it and using a mild antiseptic to clean it (I use Hibiscrub supplied by the vet). They can however become a bit nasty and infected in which case they often need antibiotics to get rid of them.     Either way you need to let the vet have a look just to be sure.|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	My lab had the SAME problem. The vet said it was either flea bite dermatitis or just plain allergies just like we get. Labs are bad about that. There is no way to get rid of it permenantly, but you can go to the vet, you shouldn't have to take your dog. I never have. Tell them you need half and half spray. It is Gentamicin/Miconazole spray. It works wonders when there's a flare up! It's also good for ear infections, hot spots, or any kind of skin condition. It cost $16.50 at my vet. The price is very reasonable. And very much worth it!

ad3ORARNaa	I would continue with short walks.  Also remember to keep him on a leash at all times.  I have an American Pitbull Terrier and you have to remember that your dog is a Pitbull also and although they are mild tempered if they feel you are in danger they will fight to the death to protect you.|`|AA12128656	no that's not really true. although you do need to be careful with their joints, walking is fine. what you need to be careful of is jumping on and off of things, out of the car, etc. any hard impact to the joints can cause damage. walking and puppy games will be just fine.     just don't walk too far yet, he's a baby!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	It's only really puppies of giant breeds that need restricted exercise. Puppies of normal sized breeds are fine to be exercised, they have a lot of energy to burn off! You can't really do extreme exercise like flyball with puppies, you need to avoid impact on their joints while they're growing. But an hour's run a day, no probs!    Unless you've been told that your specific dog has dodgy hips and needs restricted exercise, you do not need to restrict your pup's exercise. Burn off their energy - especially important with staffs, who have an excess of it and can end up with behavioural problems if frustrated through not enough exercise.    Chalice|`|A9qDWpXUaa	You need to be careful not to over walk puppies, some breeds more than others. At this age I would be using  short 15 min walks two or three times as socialization opportunities rather than exercise. Let him meet and greet as many people and other friendly dogs as you can, take him on the bus, train, to the shops out in the country to meet livestock this is so important at this stage of his life. You can gradually build up the exercise later.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Walking isn't really a problem so long as you don't over-tire the puppy.  Jumping is the problem.  Puppies should not be forced to jump until they are  2 years old and after they have had their hips xrayed for soundness.
QePbhS8Caa	You don't want terriers or herding dogs. Well, with the exception of the Boston Terriers, which are technically not terriers as they are a cross-breed of terrier and bulldog. They're great for apartments because they're small, and  don't bark unless necessary. They get on well with kids, are well-mannered and are highly trainable. Terriers are usually high energy and herding dogs sometimes try to herd children, especially if they aren't being played with enough.    Sporting breeds and working breeds are generally higher energy and need adequate exercise or room to run.    You should definitely try http://www.petfinder.com If you're going to a shelter, tell the person there what you are looking for in a dog so that they can help steer you towards dogs that might be what you're looking for and spend some time there with the dog to see if you get along.|`|ar2So81eaa	I recommend adopting from a shelter or SPCA. Mutts are great. I have a Bichon, and I love him to death, but pure breds are so expensive and they have tons of health problems.

Good luck!|`|jeoznHb8aa	If you want a calm dog, a puppy wouldn't be right for you.  Puppies of any breed will be very high energy and will require a lot of attention and exercise that a small apartment may not allow them.      An older dog sounds like a better choice for you.  Many older dogs are calm, housetrained, and already know commands.  I adopted a 6 year old beagle mutt, and he is very calm and happy in my small apartment.  He mostly lounges on his dog bed all day, and only needs to be exercised about twice a week.      You should go to a shelter that will let you try the dog out for a week or so, and test the dog around the children.|`|QDdsjGtCaa	You need to make sure that you can provide a good quality of life for a pet if your living in an apartment, if you go to your local dog santuary or humane society they will allocate you a dog suitable to you needs, this is because they dont like to see dogs being returned.|`|ad3ORARNaa	18 month and 7 month children are not safe around dogs nor are dogs safe around them.

Pups are high energy, they need to be house trained, and if you want something calm, that's just not gonna work. Go to your shelter and try to find an older dog (1 year and up) that's already house trained, and has a good history with kids. Or look in classified ads on the internet or in your newspaper. There's lots of people giving away dogs every day! kijiji.com is a very good site to go on if you're looking for a new pet. I'd go to petfinder.com first, though. Fill out all that info on the left side of the page, and it will find dogs based on the info you filled out. (It finds dogs that are close to where you live, also.)  By getting an older dog, that dog already has an established personality, and it's easier to find a dog that meets what you're looking for. =] It really doesn't matter what breed, but it's more about the individual dog.

A adult will be better, no puppy teething.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	You cannot really tell a dog's temperament solely on its breed because all dogs are different.  When you go to adopt your puppy or dog, ask one of the employees to suggest the calmest, friendly small dog; one that isn't as energized.  They should hopefully have an idea of some of the dogs there and be able to make some suggestions.  I would also try to bring your nephews in to meet the dog before you adopt it, see how the dog interacts around them.  Make sure your nephews understand the boundaries with the new dog and that you supervise them at all times.    Good Luck and thanks for choosing to adopt!
13xTQ5lsaa	Sounds like a typical young cat to me!  Are all his toys similar in nature?  Are the types of toys he steals from your son similar, but different for his toys?  Cats are very individual as to which kinds of toys they like to play with - and he could be trying to show you the types of things he wants to play with.  More likely, he could just be trying to get attention, and he's figured out that is one way to get it.  He might need more interaction and someone to play with him (chasing strings, laser lights, feather wands, etc.)    Spray bottles and shake cans do work if you are diligent - but you might want to decide on acceptable compromises first (like the blanket - all cats will sit on blankets whenever they can - maybe get him his own if you don't want him on yours?) It won't make a nice life for either you or the cat to correct him on everything that he does, so choose which things drive you absolutely nuts and which parts of "being a cat" you can deal with.  As for the plants,  he will never learn to leave your plants alone until he has something appropriate to chew on (he'll just learn not to get caught, which can be dangerous since a lot of houseplants are toxic)  Get some cat grass (wheat grass) for him to chew on, and if you catch him eating your plants, say no and take him to his.  Some cats will readily chew on small rawhides (he might take to those instead of your baskets), but some won't.  As for the shoelaces - strings in general are almost irresistable to cats, so it would be better just to keep shoes put away.    He is still very young, and as young cats go, will try your patience.  Be strong, and you'll make it through.    Please ignore the other poster - catnip is perfectly safe for cats.  It is nothing like "drugs for people".  Some cats do act "loopy" for a few minutes - but where drugs can completely alter brain chemistry and cause damage to people - catnip does not do that to a cat - it works more like a pheromone, and some cats are not affected by it at all.       Good Luck!|`|FlsrXuJOaa	I have had all the same issues. What works for me is just a spray bottle of water. Whenever my kitties are misbehaving (which is often, they are playful kitties!) I spritz them with the spray bottle. It really works! Now I don't even have to spray it, I just shake it as a warning and they stop what they are doing.    as for your plants, you really should watch that situation b/c some tropical house plants are poisonous to pets. you might look them up on the internet to see. There are some really good pet repellent products you should be able to buy at a garden center that will keep your cat off the plants.|`|q9qWHXcLaa	well first it sounds like he's not that amused he might want more attention and your actualy lucky in my point my cats soooo lazy she's fat give him more attention and NEVER let me repeat NEVER give a cat cat nip it's like giving a person drugs so more attention no catnip and maybe make it a mental challenge for your cat to find his toys food and other things he likes|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	a water gun and time. he should calm down after he hits about 2
AA10029366	Because she's afraid he might kill them.    DOGS ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. She has no concept that he is the father of the puppies, and neither does he. They aren't a "family".    Unless you want to stress your b*tch to the point of killing her own litter, you will keep the male AWAY from her.    She's not whining "for" him, she's stressed out and probably afraid he'll come back.    Christ.|`|AA12128656	because MALE DOGS have NO BUSINESS being around NEWBORN PUPS    FEMALE KNOWS what's best.    you need to learn before you breed again.

Maybe when they are three weeks old or so she'll be calmer.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	That is NORMAL.  A responsible, knowledgable breeder would NEVER let ANY other dogs near the mother and pups.    She's not whining for him, she's STRESSED.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Do not look on this as 'he's the father of these puppies'.  These are dogs, and all she knows is she has to protect her puppies from ANY and ALL dogs.  She's only had them for 48 hours and she needs to be in a safe quiet place, well away from the bustle of the household, and all other dogs/cats.  Otherwise she could well turn on her puppies - seriously!  She's confused at this point between her maternal instincts (to protect her new babies) and her buddie (the sire).  Don't put her in this situation.    In any case, other dogs, even in the same family should not be near these newborns for health reasons.  They could well bring infection to the litter.    So please keep them all right away from her and her babies, until they are at least 3 weeks, and you start to wean them.  She needs to feel secure and be left in peace to rear her babies.  By all means, in about another week, let her see your other dogs, but well away from her litter.  And it might be as well, since you do have at least one other dog, to wipe her feet with a mild antiseptic when she goes back in with the puppies, to help prevent infection.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	All of the people above me are totally right, but also do not let "ALL" te family members near the puppies either!  The mother is very nervous and stressed, you do not want her to feel uncomfortable around you and your family, and she may even try to bite and protect her puppies from even you guys.  Watch her and supervise her, but give her some space!   Don't let people sit there and touch them or get too close to her.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	EDIT: New comment here....I have been hacked yet again and am seriously considering not contributing any more. whoever is doing it, it has been reported AGAIN.

Keep him away from her to give her security.|`|mnufOa6eaa	Females are protective of their pups. Especially at such a young age. Once they are older she'll probably be more relaxed with him around them, but possibly not. Some females can even be so protective they won't let people near the pups.     Keep her and the pups in one room with the door closed or a baby gate that the male can't jump in the door way. And keep him away from the pups when she needs to go outside.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	shes protecting her pups|`|PdotFx4naa	Animal mothers feel the need to keep their pups safe.  You NEVER let ANY dog around her or the pups for at least 3-4 weeks anyway!  The pups are very suceptible to diseases and germs and could easily die just from another dog being around!  You should have your dogs fixed and find them new homes if you don't even know that much!  Give me a break.  Also, dogs don't "fall in love" like humans.  The mate to breed and that's all they care about!  She probably kept whining because she was extremely sterssed out!  The poor thing just had babies and in her mind he is there to kill them and mate with her again!  Get rid of those ******* dogs and do some research before owning another!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	This is a question for your breed mentor.  Please ask them.  Hopefully both parents have their breed championships.      Hopefully both parents have had all of their health and genetic testing done.  Hopefully both dogs are registered with a reputable registry.  Hopefully you have had the mom and pups to your vet for a wellness check.  Hopefully you have a contract and a health guarantee to go with the pups.  Hopefully you have a contract stating that you'll take the pups back at any time, for any reason.    You do know that intact dogs have a much greater chance of cancers?    You do know that because of backyard breeders like yourself, millions of dogs are euthanized in shelters each year.

Not usual, but not unheard of.  I would try and get her spayed immediately, since if it is not a full blown heat, it can be dealt with readily.  If she is in heat, some vets will wait, and others will spay, but the cost is higher.    And, if she is in heat, don't wait long after she gets out of heat for spaying, as she can go back into heat faster than you can imagine.|`|cdef7d57cde545f4d5b263c965f9a1f9aa	Female cats go into heat at 6 months for the first time and tend to stay in heat for about 3 weeks.

qqUvoC5uaa	1. Dogs "sweat" in our context by panting which is a way of increasing O2 levels through the body as a cooling system. Dogs do have 2 types of sweat glands The first type is called merocrine glands. These are located in the foot pads of dogs and function to help cool the animal. The second type is called apocrine glands. These are located on most of the rest of the dog but they do not function to cool the animal; their purpose is to release pheromones.<br>  2.

AA10029366	If I had a breed running through the bushes all day, *I* wouldn't want their ears cropped -- opens up the canal for all kinds of debris and injury.    OTOH, if I had a breed prone to getting an ear ripped in an altercation (human, canine, or prey-related), I'd want those ears cropped.    I realize that you're asking about a "modern" need for ear cropping. I think on dogs still used for hunting (i.e. the APBT, used in Pig hunting) it's probably relevant, but otherwise I'm personally torn.    I prefer the outline of a cropped dog. I think that it makes a dog developed for guarding/protection appear more alert and intimidating. I've balked on getting a cropped breed, however, because I don't want to go through the process.     Would I outlaw it, or deny people their right and reasoning for cropping? Never.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Cropping? Not called for in the UK Kennel Club breed standard for the Dobermann. Cropping was banned many years ago. Barbaric? It depends on whether or not it is carried out by a professional & not amateur who may botch it.     Aesthetically I like a cropped ear {not the show crop} Necessary? *Not* for companion Dobermanns, as it would simply be for personal preference. *If* it was necessary for a working Dobermann to be cropped then there may be a case for necessity. The current breed standard in the USA *makes* it a necessity for the ears to be cropped. I do not agree with the practise of cropping for show/companion Dobermanns.    I would *not* have described it as a mini debate.    Docking is a hot potato because of the cases where people have botched docking a litter and the pups have either died or suffered from infection/needed a second docking. This amongst other reasons fuel the lobbying for a ban, which was introduced in 2007.    Docking was also viewed as largely unnecessary, as the majority of docked dogs {like the Dobermann} do not function in the capacity for which they were originally bred.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Ear cropping is a breed standard for showing. In the case of American Staffordshire terriers the ears are cropped to make them stand up as ears that flop down are a fault. If your dog's ears are half up (like my puppy's) you can show with uncropped ears, you may just not score as well against cropped dogs.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Probably not "necessary" for a non-working dog, but I don't have a problem with it.  I've known puppies with cropped ears, it didn't appear to bother them at all.    Usually ear cropping is not to prevent damage in the brush, but to prevent them from being grabbed by an opponent (animal or human).  I can't offhand think of any sporting dogs that have cropped ears (Foxhounds apparently had their ears "tipped"), but plenty of guard and fighting dogs have it done.    FWIW, I once read that Bull Terriers originally had cropped ears, but when it was outlawed in GB the breeders started breeding for pr*ck ears instead.  Anyone up on their Bully history that can confirm this?|`|9kTejB0uaa	Absolutely no good reason that I know of.  I'll be interested to know if there is a good reason actually, or it is purely down to looks and what has become accepted, in some breeds.  To me, the whole procedure is barbaric, not the least because it's done later, when the puppy can, and does, feel discomfort, if not downright pain.  I have to say I rather like the 'sharp' look it gives a Schnauzer, for example.  But on the other hand, I much prefer a Great Dane or a Boxer uncropped.  These breeds do not need to look aggressive.  Thank goodness my now two breeds, Bassets and Whippets don't have any of this nonsense done to them (other than, in Whippets, their dewclaws).    Incidentally, because I hated snipping them off,  I used to show my Bassets with their whiskers left on, in Canada.  And I made them up, whiskers and all!!  I did trim their trousers, and the twist of fur off the tip of their tail though lol|`|AA12083992	Dogs use their ears and tails for communication and their tails for balance. I am against cropping and docking unless it is for a medical reason.  edit: Whip tail would be an example of a reason to dock the tail.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	In years past ears were cropped so that protection and guard dogs didn't "telegraph" their intentions. So now-a-days about the only working reason is for -- well I guess Vicks knows more about that than I do.    I have hunted with way to many dogs that can step on their ears with no problems to think hunting is a reason.    On the other hand I have personally had to deal with a dog that had a cow stomp on it's tail (not pretty), so I wouldn't have a Heeler with a tail again.|`|vPde97E2aa	NOBODY'S BUSINESS WHAT *I* DO W/**MY** DOGS!!!    My breed is docked but not cropped. I *DO* dock & dew!    If my breed was CROPPED...I WOULD CROP!!  No know-nothing AR-brainwashed ignoramus is going to dictate what I do or don't w/MY dogs.      added=NO working terrier breed is cropped! Yes,Schnauazers are but they were never bred as working terriers.   I've hunted/worked both prick *&* drop-earred breeds. BOTH have taken hits to their ears....multiple piercings....none ripped. Ears bleed & heal.    Working terriers don't rat...a rat bite is NOTHING,unless PULLED into a slash. Hits to the lips/mouth,etc. are far more common & of slightly more concern.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	I think that at this point it is a purely cosmetic procedure that is reminiscent of tradition.    I have nothing against cropping, but I do not believe that it is truly *necessary*    BTW, did you all know that the united states veterinary association issued a statement against docking and cropping?|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Breeds were cropped for various reasons.   Dobies who were bred for personal protection were cropped to remove a handhold for potential human attackers and also due to the cropped ear being better able to pinpoint sound.    Great Danes were boarhounds and were cropped to prevent the ears from being torn by the tusks of the animals they hunted, APBT were bred originally for bull baiting and as catch dogs for butchers and then later dog fighting and were cropped to prevent the ears from being torn.     No done by a licensed vet under anesthesia it is not barbaric.   It is also not purely cosmetic.  It still serves various purposes in some breeds.  It prevents injury in dogs still used for their original work,  It allows dogs used for protection and guarding to better pinpoint sound,   in humid areas it reduces the risk of ear infection etc.|`|ifNr13kfaa	Nowadays it's primarily cosmetic.  I've never heard of any reason (medically) it's done today.  So if you want your pit bull to look like a typical pit bull, crop the ears, otherwise leave them long, and you'll have a lot more people willing to talk to you...People are afraid of typical looking pit bulls due to their known aggression at the hands of a bad owner.|`|PdotFx4naa	It's all about looks.  There is no need to crop the ears of these dogs.  Even to show them, their ears do not need to be cropped.|`|Jp6qXWeYaa	I hate it! I think it is a form of mutilation! It's basically plastic surgery for your dog now a days! I feel that you should accept dogs the way that they are! I have three dogs and I will NEVER cut their ears or tail. Ever. Why put them through pain and healing for "beauty"?|`|mnufOa6eaa	NO, NO, and NO! Neither of these procedures are neccessary today. The ears are for cosmetic reasons, people want the dogs to look more menacing or think it makes them look more regal. I feel that if the dog is born with floppy ears, they should stay that way. Plus, they look better that way and it saves the dogs the pain of it. I have owned a Doberman and didn't get his ears done, he looked cuter without. I have a German Shepherd mix, he's mostly Shepherd though. His ears didn't stand up and I didn't do a thing about it because he's not purebred and he wasn't going to be shown so it didn't matter. If he pruebred and was show quality and was going to be shown, I would have been forced to tape his ears to they stood erect.    As for the tail, it's not neccessary anymore. There was a reason for it back in the day, but not anymore. The only reason they are still done is because of the breed standard, they couldn't be shown with full tails so they have to dock them. I personally think we should become like the UK and ban all cosmetic dockings and cropings. If there is a medical need for it, that's one thing, but just because it's the way it is is not a good enough answer.    So yes, I think it's barbaric and outdated. I have an Australian Shepherd, her tail is docked, not by my choice. If it had been up to me, she'd have a tail.    To the person who said no one is going to tell him what to do with his dogs, we are expressing our opinion, not telling you not to(But if the government passed a law banning it you would not be able to do it just because you wanted to). If you want to dock your dogs tails and crop their ears, that's your choice, doesn't mean I have to like it or agree with it. On the same note, no one should tell those of us who don't like cropping and docking not to get a dog that is usually docked and/or cropped if we don't like it. Just because I don't like cropping doesn't mean I won't get a Doberman, it just means I won't do it to my Doberman. It's my choice not to crop just like it's your choice to crop or not. I can't control the docking since it's done at such a young age. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't buy a Doberman or Aussie with a full tail. If I want these breeds, which I do, I just have to deal with the tail being docked until we as a country become more enlightened.    Think about it, how would you like your parents to decide to cut your ears into a point when you were a baby? How would you like them to decide that you need to have 3 fingers and a thumb instead of 4 and a thumb? Or 4 toes instead of 5? This is what we are doing to our dogs by cropping and docking. They don't have a choice in the matter.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	There is no functional reason for a dog's ears to be cropped.  It is a purely cosmetic procedure.  Personally, I find it appalling to surgically alter a dog or any other living animal for appearance's sake.|`|DZBcnbHsaa	dogs are supposed to have tails, however it is very nice that my boxers do not, for as hyper as they are it would be very annoying.  as far as ear cropping, with my boxers they are not cropped, i had the choice but choose not to because its not always guaranteed that they stand up...it is just a personal choice unless you plan to show the dog(s)|`|fO1ZzPXyaa	God made them with floppy ears. He doesn't mess up, so no. I don't think they should be cropped. What's it hurting?|`|pGacaRuFaa	I don't like ear cropping, but some dogs need their tails docked if they are worked. Corgi's tails need docked so they don't get stepped on and dragged under the hooves of cattle, for example. Ear cropping makes the ears more sensitive, and the dog is more likely to be snappish. AKC has started making it optional instead of mandatory for showing, with no penalties among min pins.|`|iXijnCxOaa	No, its not necessary unless the dog is of a breed that requires cropping due to the nature of its work.     Is there a need for it?  Yes, sometimes.     Personally, I wouldn't want to attempt to deal with trying to heal a terrier's ear that had been ripped by a rat.    As far as communication... wolves and other wild canids - with their erect ears, communicate quite well.  In fact, I would say drop earred dogs are at a disadvantage when it comes to communicating some things.  It is much easier to read the pulled up tight, ears twisted to the side combined with posture on a dog with erect ears... so saying cropped dogs are at a disadvantage from drop earred dogs simply doesn't fly.    While dog breeds were being developed, appearance took a back seat to function.  Ears were cropped and tails were docked because, for some breeds, it was safer for the nature of the work they did.    Edit: Thanks for clarifying Blunt!!  I love learning from the REAL experts here.  I didn't realize the cute pricked ears on some of the terrier breeds were natural.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Depends on the breed standard. There was a reason for it and the standard is what is expected. I find no reason to change it now.  Is there a reason for circumcision? what about ear piercing? or how about tattoos? I think there is nothing better looking than a dog that nears the breed standard. Just think how ugly a Dobbie would be with floppy ears and a long tail..................yuk!!!!!|`|AvKTsXHbaa	I would crop ears only a working dog, or a show dog.  A pet is not going to require the extra work and expense of ear cropping.|`|Zg4wyxVhaa	I think for the general family dog there is no reason to do it and all the breeds I have seen look better to me with their ears intact. I can see what you are saying about a hunting dog that is going to tangle with a hog or something else as ferocious, but most do not have that to contend with that.    Since you mentioned tail docking - do you or anyone else know why Schipperkes have their tails docked?|`|3SSVBJAqaa	I think its cruel.|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	It's not worth it unless you are doing professional dog shows.    i mean, is it necessary for you to cut off your fingers? no, not really.|`|AA12128656	purely cosmetic.    i don't believe necessary.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I couldn't see any other reason than for showings...
K0uTjeWiaa	Actually both. Cats like to eat a lot of small meals throughout the day but they also like to expect something 'new'  I leave food out all day but have a set time for dinner. Also Iams or any dry isn't the best for cats        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|KrkftOfkaa	A feeding schedule is usually good for the first year of a cat's life.  Though as individuals some will "graze" off of what you leave and some will scarf down things as soon as possible, it depends on the cat.  It teaches the cat to graze a bit better.  You SHOULD however be limiting the amount of food your cat gets in a day.  For most dry cat foods an adult cat should only be eating about 3/4 to 1 cup of food a day.  Just topping off food whenever can leads to having a 30  cat.  Though again that does depend on the personality of the cat and it's activity level.      On the side of the kitten (and probably cat too, but haven't gotten that far with my kitten yet) food bags there is usually a amount per day and a number of times per day feeding recommendation for their age.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	it is not a good thing just to leave food out for them they will over eat and if they don't get excercized enough they will gain weight which can cause many health problems.|`|YBcB0732aa	Its easier to tell if your cat not eating/sick if you don't leave food out all the time. By the time you cat is has lost a lot a weight it might be too sick to get better.  "Always be observant and report to your veterinarian any time a cat stops eating for two or more days. (Thats one of the subtle problems with the free choice method of feeding. We often do not notice that the cats food dish is still full until the cat is well into a fasting mode. When cats are sick the first clinical sign is often a loss of appetite; so a non-interactive, free choice feeding protocol provides less information to us than an interactive portion controlled feeding method.) Any cat that hasnt eaten in three days is in trouble! Seven days of fasting actually impacts the cats immune system."|`|RN1wGlWWaa	For kittens, its fine to free feed up to about 5 months old.  After they they really should have sceduled meals so they do not overeat.  Its rare to have a cat that will not get fat on free feeding once they are grown.    And you can monitor how much they really are eating and regulate their weight too.    The only time food is left out in our house is when the cats are home for the weekend while we are showing one of them and are not gonna be back home the same day (showing overnite).|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	It depends on the individual cat. If your kitten seems to gorge itself and is getting chunky, then meals would be best. Typically though, cats do okay if they are free fed (with the opposite being true for many dogs, but not all).|`|o5jf15TTaa	well my cat is wild, he goes out and eats his own food and comes back full..     i don't think it really matters, however your cat will get much fatter if you let him "graze" because animals will eat untill they are COMPLETELY full and if you top the food when empty... yea not good. but if you dont mind having a fat and lazy cat go for it.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Much better to have set mealtimes. Access to food all the time leads to fat cats and wet food can spoil.  It also attracts pests.|`|q9qWHXcLaa	schedule is way better|`|da226878178305e69798e83c0c9aa3d8aa	all my cat gets is dry food. she is and indoor cat and we leave tehh food out for her all day and night. (:|`|becb148de69b19c4086477946d04d3aeaa	I leave dry food out for my cats all day. They are indoor cats and the vet said they are all healthy and not over weight.|`|4c7e85bedb3ecf38130aba6a55a22aa7aa	I've actually read (in the book "Think Like a Cat" - a fantastic resource by the way) that it's best to let kittens eat whenever they please (ie. let them graze) because of the increased rate that they are growing at.  Additionally, cats usually won't continue eating past the point of fullness, so it is okay to let them graze so long as they don't seem to be getting overweight.  Both methods have their strong points, but in most situations it is perfectly fine to allow cats to eat when they please unless they become overweight.|`|kV5IRgpfaa	I let my cat graze, but she doesn't over eat. If your cat becomes bored it may treat the food bowl as "entertainment". If you see your cat is putting on the pounds, set a fixed time. Otherwise, let em' eat when they feel like it.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Feeding times.  Allowing them to free feed = obesity.  Plus, in the wild, they only eat when they can catch something and aren't able to "graze" all day, so don't worry, they'll be just fine on 2 or 3 meals a day.  Decide how much they should get, divide it into 2 or 3 (depending on how many times a day you want to feed them) and stick to it.|`|rPnce3c2aa	You should feed your cat 2 times per day. in the morning and in the evening, if you leave food for him the whole day then ofcourse he will finish it, but then you might be risking your cat someday getting overweight, not to mention if you dont give your cat the right amount of food per day he needs, his poop could get pretty smelly:)|`|pWMcAod5aa	I believe it depends on the cat and their eating habits. My Cat is very active and is more on the slender side. I use to feed him before I left for work and when I got home but he kept getting thinner so I now leave a bowl of dry food filled for a couple of days and feed him wet food twice a day to regain his body weight. He eats only when he's hungry so it's working out. I know of other cats that eat all day and sleep all day making them over weight. So do what's best for your cat and if you still have concerns get with your veternarian.
3n60UxgQaa	Money, money, money.    While females can actually live in communities, you have to have 4 or more and at first, they fight.  That means, torn fins.  And when you add more or take them out, they fight again to establish territory.  Torn fins doesn't look very appealing.    And males cannot be in any tank with another betta, regardless of gender.    Keeping them in the cups is a lot cheaper than getting them 1-5 gallon tanks each, especially since they carry so many.    And having them die isn't much of a loss for them.  You buy them for about $3, depending on which kind.  That means, they buy for even less, probably 10-50 cents a piece.     [None of the above is my view.  Just my opinions on why they keep in  cups.  I do think they should have tanks. =]]|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Because male bettas cant be kept with any other betta. And male bettas would get picked on in quite a few tanks. Really, it just comes down to space.    I mean, I understand that they are kept in separate containers... But the containers really should be tanks. Its not healthy in any way for the bettas.    People do think they live in fish bowls. Even the good pet stores Ive been in, right next to the bettas, theres always little betta kits and bowls and all that stuff.    Its something that needs to change, but I doubt it ever will.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	They are agressive and will kill other fish, sometimes even there own mates.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	The pet-store housing in small containers is temporary. The bettas won't die right away in the small containers, but that's not a good way to keep them in the long term. I've also noticed that many pet stores put fish tranquilizers in those small cups of water to calm the bettas and slow their metabolism. I can tell because the product they usually use turns the water blue.    They don't keep them in a regular fish tank because the store can't afford to keep only one betta per tank, and if they put two or more in the same tank they would fight with each other and probably kill each other.    However, once you take them home, they need reasonable accomodations like any other fish.|`|OsVswissaa	The stores only need to keep them long enough to sell them, and if they die, well they only cost .25 cents for the store.  So they do it because they're cheap and they don't care and they believe all the mud puddle and hoofprint nonsense.|`|MzgecQSLaa	if you put two or more bettas in the same bowl, they would fight each other, and get seriously injured, or even death.|`|oTySDUMxaa	Beta fish originally come from small swamps in thailand and places near there. The swamps are quite small so the are used to it, if they are kept in a tank more than 15 gallons it may shock them which could cause death. Did u no that beta's can be kept in tanks as small as 2 gallons - 8 litres!! some people see this as cruel but it would resemble life in the swamps !    hope that helped !|`|6KsGSDh5aa	Because they do not get along.  Stores would have to have 50 tanks just to house 50 male betta's and they obviously are not going to do that or go thru that expense.    Betta's live in just inches of water in rice paddies. Those cups do not hurt them for the time they are shipped to their purchase.  Medication is also added to those cups.    I think those plastic cups bother us far more than they do the Betta's.  I bet they don't mind those cups nearly as much as they mind a small, uncycled tank.|`|ttWY0vJeaa	I work at a pet store and the Betta's come in to us in very small bags that are about 4 inches long by 3 inches wide. We place them in cups because we get about 50 of them each shipment and that would be alot of individual tanks to set up. Our cups are alot bigger than those that I have seen at  Petsmart. We do have a 2.5 gallon tank set up with a male betta with gravel, aquatic wood and plants, so that people can see what that they can reside in just a bowl. The cups really are easy for the customers to transport them from our store to home and we never really have them in the store for long, as they are one of the more popular fish. We also put a betta in a couple of our community fish tanks, so people can see that they can put them with other fish and what types are compatible with them,|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	Because the cups are temporary.     The turnover rate of bettas in a typical petstore is extraordinary. those bettas are in those cups for a week, maybe 2 weeks max.     it is not practical to place bettas in the tank systems for a few reasons.     1. you cannot have a betta only tank, obviously, they would fight.     2. in a typical petstore, the fish are (hopefully) divided in tanks by who is compatable with whom.     one tank might have 3 species of tetras, another, smaller S.A. cichlids, so on and so on.     because of this, there will be whole tanks of aggressive or semi aggressive fish. You cannot place a betta in those tanks. There will be tanks of mostly peaceful fish, who are really only peaceful to each other. you put brightly colored, long flowing fins in that tank, and no more betta.     so lets say a typical petstore has a wall of tanks, and there are maybe 35-40 different tanks, only 6 of those will be able to house a single betta with the fish that are in there.     a store cannot, absolutely cannot order only 6 bettas. The profit they will receive from the animals has to cost more than the cost of shipping.       this is why bettas are kept in those small cups. Any pet store that is worth its salt will change the water every day, if not every other day, and the bettas are healthy.   it is nothing but lazyness and lack of care for a pet store to have bettas in filthy water....it doesn't take that long to change out the water in those cups.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	because its all about money|`|wD9sdGhZaa	Because they'd rather save money than provide the best possible environment for their fish.  They are hoping that the bettas will be sold quickly and won't be housed permanently in those little cups.    They can't be placed in tanks with other bettas because the males would fight each other.|`|mnufOa6eaa	Because they breath air so they think it's acceptable to keep them this way.     But it's not, they should be in bigger tanks with heat.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Because they can cram more product in a smaller space that way increasing their profits. If you put two males together they'll fight,  so each would need its own tank - the little cups are the cost and space effcient method of doing that.    Sadly that makes many betta owners think theirs only needs a ridculously small amount of unfiltered water to be happy and healthy.|`|2dV79LHiaa	They can live in a fish bowl! but just one fish per bowl! they are Japanese fighting fish and will kill the other fish. thats why you see them in small bowls to themsevels. You have to put a plant in the water also.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	well first off they can not be put in with other fish and I don't like the fact that they are kept in small containers it is a form off cruelty because they are suppost to be in a 1 quart container.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Because some petstores don't know their ar$e from their elbow.    In stores I go to they are either in custom build small holding tanks specially for Bettas, on the same central filtration as the rest of the tanks, or they are out in the main tanks.    Reasons to be kept separate include the current in the store tanks being too strong or lack of suitable tankmates - they'd be nipped to bits by Cichlids, Gouramis, some Barbs and Tetras and entirely bothered by very active fish like Loaches. And be eaten by larger oddballs.    This doesn't mean they don't need proper care though, in the shape of filters and heaters. I don't know any stores near me that keep them separate in tubs or cups without filtration.
XagPxe7Faa	It depends on the breeder has invested in their program.  Find out what costs they are trying to cover--cost of stock, show expenses, medical testing, etc.  Judge for yourself if what they are charging seems fair.  Raising a litter of puppies, not to mention care for the adults, in an ETHICAL manner is not a cheap venture.|`|zL1sggpCaa	It all depends on what comes with the pup....

KEYgd73saa	"Watts per gallon" is a pathetic excuse for a "rule", on par with the "inch of fish per gallon of water" idea.  In reality, it depends entirely on the bulbs you're using.  With high output T-5s, you could probably get away with about 30 watts over your tank, while you'd probably want about 60 watts of compact fluorescent lighting or standard fluorescent tubes.  If you can get any T-5 dual strip, or HO (high output) or VHO (very high output) T-5 strip, go right ahead-- brand isn't of much importance.  If you don't want to spend that much money, consider getting an incandescent hood, replacing the incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescents from a home improvement store.  The last thing to consider would be shop lighting from somewhere like Home Depot.  Aim for 6,000-6,200K bulbs with peak emissions in the red and blue spectrum, as this is optimal for photosynthesis.|`|6KsGSDh5aa	http://www.bigalsonline.com/BigAlsUS/ctl...
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Any filter will circulate the water adequately for a four-gallon tank.    Do you mean you already have a Marineland filtration system, or that you don't have one and don't want one?    If you have the Marineland, it will do all the water circulation you need.   If you don't have one, there are many other brands of filters out there, and any of them would meet your needs.    Usually, the standard hang-on-the-back style of power filter is the easiest to use. They are now available in small sizes suitable for a four-gallon tank.  But the design of some small tanks (specifically, of some tank tops) makes it hard or impossible to use a hang-on-the-back filter. For these tanks, I recommend an air-driven sponge filter. I like the Hydro-Sponge, made by Aquarium Technology, Inc., but there are several other good brands. For a sponge filter, you will also need an air pump and some air hose (also called airline tubing).|`|6KsGSDh5aa	You could use a sponge filter for a tank that small.  It will need a small piece of airline and a water pump that can be purchased cheaply for that size tank.    Corner filters will also work but don't get one you must constantly have to buy replacements for them.  Those you can stuff with filter floss yourself would work fine.    Check online for internet filters.|`|blDuOKKmaa	you should only need the tubes and the pump and it will turn out fine

tPGxPDvBaa	Bil-jac isn't a good food so you are right about that.  You can try several different foods that were created as alternative or to be feed in addition to  a raw diet.  These are  Freshpet, Natural Balance Food rolls,Honest Kitchen, Nature's variety, Sojourner Farms & Noah Kingdom.  They all come either fresh, frozen or as  a pre-mix which you add water.  They are a far healthier & better quality food than Bil-jac.  You can go to the co. site & find out where they sold near you.  You might want to consider feeding a raw diet instead.|`|AA12128656	lol. your dog won't eat dry because she hasn't been hungry enough.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I give my dogs the Bil-Jac dry and they gobble it down without any problems...

EJpiaCMQaa	Your budgie is very happy and loves you alot.  Chirping is a sign of happiness and good health.  The regurgitating means he has bonded to you and loves you.  He is showing you affection, just like he would to another budgie.  I had a budgie that regurgitated to me all the time, but he died in May 2008 of cancer.  I miss him so much.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Yes, he is definitely happy. One of the way of expressing his happiness is his constant chirping. When they start screeching they are expressing discomfort.     For your keet to perch on your finger without biting take a lot of training and interaction. It is normal for then to fear your and your big hand and bite it as defense mechanism.     Regurgitating is normal for keets. As long as he is vomiting. If he is vomiting and not regurgitating then he might sick and need attention of a vet.    -rds
