20090202193726AAif5Wx	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Since you pay taxes, how much of every thing do you think you own?	For example:   You own a little piece of every road in the entire US.   You own a piece of every school building.   A little bit of each federal employees pay check.   A chunk of every building on every military base.   A small piece of every military vehicle.   A piece of every prison building.   Part of every SWAT team member's uniform.   Some of the dirt on every college campus.   A little piece of the Hubble Telescope and every space shuttle.   Every thing that our Fed. tax dollars pay for, you and I own a little bit of it.   Plus a little of every thing that your state's taxes pay for.   Not to mention every welfare check they hand out to any one, belongs to you.   But how much of every thing do you think it is fair to say each person who has been paying taxes for Ten years or more really owns?   For example, someone said they have paid taxes for 30 yrs and he thinks he only owns a teeny, tiny stone on the road. What do you think?
20090202193552AAqKmiO	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Renters rights/24 hours notice question!?	I know that my apartment complex needs to give me 24 hours notice before entering my home, but what about them giving 24 hours notice to make a request of me? We have a bug problem and are periodically sprayed. They've been fully spraying the kitchens about once a quarter and demand that we empty everything out of all of the cupboards and that the apartment be clean. I don't have a problem with the clean part, but completely emptying the kitchen takes HOURS. I don't get home from work until 7 pm, and then I have kid duties, dinner, homework, etc. I also have evening functions and church meetings a few times a week. I've asked the management to give me more time, and they verbally said they would call me at least 48 hours in advance.       Today, I get home after 7, and there's another note saying that everything has to be removed tonight. I made a written complaint about the bugs on Saturday and was told that they would send the bug man on Tuesday, and that I needed to only remove the items on my counter.      I just do not have the 3 to 4 hours tonight that it will take to remove everything from my kitchen. The note said "YOU CANNOT REFUSE SERVICE" But I do not have the time.       Can I legally refuse at this point? Can they make you move things with only a 24 hour notice?      Thanks

Hello,   I am filing my tax's this year for the first time and I was wondering how much a place like H&R bock would charge me for this service? And or if I did a e-file would it be faster or just as fast as the company above? And I was reading about a earned income tax credit for people whom made less then 15,000 for the year of 2008. And I fall in that category and was trying to figure out if I can apply for that tax credit. Or what the qualifications are? And also noticed that there is a extra kick if you didn't get the full 600 dollars last year for the stimulus and they are giving you extra now? If so do I ask H&R bock about this service or ect? Thank you for all the information.                         Also   I am single live on my own no kids.   And I may consider other options too as   liberty tax's ect.. to do my return.

I am almost positive the number I called was a central operator.      The deal is this: My daughter wants to have her birthday at Chuck e cheese and my funds are limited. The smallest bday package is 10.99 but I only need the table, tokens and pizza. She wants all her table ware to be pink and I could care less about her getting a medallion. They have a organizational package that is just what I want for 5.99 but the lady on the phone says it is only for daycares, scouts, etc.     My other option is to just show up but we aren't guaranteed a table, we may have to wait. I don't want to do that on her birthday.     So I figure if I can get hold of the owner or manager, they would surely book it like I want. But try as I might, the only number I can find is the "central" one. Any help?

20090202152739AAqzTN5	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	What if you owe back taxes?	Here's my dilemma: I got a letter in the mail a few months back stating that the IRS found a mistake on my taxes from a prior year (2006 I believe). I checked it out, and sure enough, I made a mistake. I didn't have the funds to pay what I owed at the time (around $1500) so I just let it ride, knowing they would take it out of my refund this year. I have now filed my taxes and am expecting a return of $4255 (less the amount I owe plus interest) which the IRS site "Where's My Refund?" told me I should receive on Feb 3rd "Unless there are errors found, or back taxes owed".      Here's my question: I know I owe back taxes, so how long do you think it will now take for me to receive my refund? I know I won't get it tomorrow, though that would be nice!  ;)
20090202152734AA5VytW	Business & Finance;Insurance	Can a health insurance company deny emergency medical coverage based on the final diagnosis?	I went to the emergency room for symptoms suggesting a life-threatening illness. It turned out I did not have a life-threatening illness and the ER doctor diagnosed something much less severe. However, now my health insurance company is refusing to pay for the emergency room fee based on that diagnosis.      This seems unethical to me. My symptoms indicated an emergency, so I went to the hospital. Just because it turned out I didn't actually have a condition requiring emergency medical attention, doesn't mean my health insurance company has the right to deny me coverage.

20090202162823AA4XRsL	Business & Finance;Insurance	How to get through to an Insurance Company that refuses to listen!?	My son, who is now 23, has had a serious back problem for 2 years.  He started out with Chiropractors and worked his way all the way up to spine Surgeons.  His Surgeon says the only way to fix it is surgery... actually 2 surgeons agree on this.  Currently he's with a Pain Doctor as well, who will give him Vicodin.  These drugs have altered his moods, not to mention his outlook on life, but without them, he couldn't function at all!!  The insurance, Personal Care, is more than happy to pay for these drugs... and his twice weekly ER visits but refuses to pay for his surgery, stating that he is too young.  He won't be able to hold his job much longer, because of the missed hours (he is on FMLA, but that only goes so far) and without the job, he won't have ANY insurance.  My question is what can he do to get it through to the insurance company that if he doesn't get the surgery, he may never work again?!  Please, please help!!  He makes too much money to get any kind of "aid"...

My dad got hurt from work when he was younger, became paralyzed, and just recently (about a year ago)  received a settlement for about $350,000. He is unable to work, and the money should have lasted had he known what to do with it, but he was talked into purchasing a house WAY above his price range ($485,000) as an investment. He was told to fix it up, redecorate, and sell it back for a profit. Lo and behold, the market crashed, he ran out of money to make the payments and has not made one for a couple months. He is now getting foreclosure warnings so he decided to put the house on the market- trouble is, the realtor says it will likely go for 450-500, same price he bought it for, and as he still has most of his loan to pay off and no settlement money left- he's screwed. Is there anything he can do to hold off a foreclosure or hold on to the home? Any advice? There has to be something- his mortgage co. had to know he couldn't afford the house, and he is slightly brain-damaged. I don't know anything about the housing market, so I'm hoping some of you do!

20090202203109AA1teL2	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	401K-Safe Harbor, termination plan distribution question?	I left my job in March of 08.  My Plan states that my benefits are 100% vested at all times and can be paid to me as soon as administratively possible after all final contributions are made.  I contacted the Department of Labor and the booklet they sent me states that in Table 7, Federal Law states that your plan must allow you to begin receiving benefits when terminating your service with the employer* * For administrative reasons, benefits do not begin immediately after meeting these conditions but at a minimum, your plan must provide that you will start receiving benefits within 60 days after the end of the plan year.  End of my plan year was 12.31.08.      I filed a claim with the plan administrator, it was denied saying that the accounts aren't completely funded and may not be until September of 09.  From what I am understanding, they have (Under Federal Law) 60 days from the end of the plan year to pay up.....and I reading this correctly?  I think I am and I am going to appeal this, but I want to make sure I am interpreting this the right way.

Our primary customer has not had any work for us for going on 2 months now Well, Ill amend that We had 2 days in December and 3 or 4 days in January and it is predicted that we wont get steady work through them until March     Our secondary customer pays little and we are only making a few hundred dollars a run to go to the company (On average 50% of the total for a run goes to the truck and then we pay the driver and then we have business expenses)    My father had to get a 2nd job to be able to keep us in our apartment     We have been on the verge of disaster since the housing bubble burst (Thanks Carter & Clinton) and with the Credit Crisis, we do not qualify for loans that would keep our collective head above water.    If we can just survive a few months until our customers can release their funds for the jobs they are contractually obligated to complete, we will be fine But until that happens it is an axe swinging above our throat.

There is a lot of different online jobs in internet, they are all convincing.  everyone can earn money anytime, anywhere, just follow all the instructions and pay first to register. I`m not a gambler, I don`t  want to risk any cents of my money, but  I want to earn money. I love computers, and its really nice to earn money while doing the things you love . what can you say about this.  example : SmartDataEntry,   they promise you can earn a huge amount of money while at home or anywhere, anytime. , but you must pay first to register,  why they cant allow first  the qualified people to do the job, even without paying money first, I really don`t  understand about this. Let the people do the job online ,then receive money later even not so big amount but true, or deduct later the necessary fee for the registration. Don`t let many people become a victim of scams.  and I`am not a victim, I`m just wondering.

20090202202439AAPMsFS	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Proposal to Make an Accounting Rule Change-?	This is for Someone that has a background in economics and accounting.   I want to change something radically about accounting rules.  I have a thought that business employees should be accounted for as creditors and not as liabilities to businesses on the balance sheet.  There benefits are to be accounted for the same way corporate officers are accounted for in the business. Is this possible?  Please speculate.  I am trying to setup a dynamic that by baseline default their is a more equal distribution of corporate profits into the business.    Do you see this as possible by shifting the balance sheet.  Especially in light of universal health care bring brought about and taken off the shoulders of employers.  My hope is that the essential equity of placement in the balance sheet will in itself close the gap between corporate officers and employees.  Employees today are truly only contractors anyway with the national average employment period only 8 years or less.      Its rather old fashioned and counter productive to our US economy at large to strange off the profits of a company from the laborers that contributed to the profit. Employees are not chattel, widgets and furniture they should be accounted for more appropriately (than slaves).

I know many of you would not agree with me on this. But every year I have them take extra money out of my taxes so i get a big refund at the end of the year. My tax refund every year is my "fun" money. I buy new clothes and do things i cant normally do all year. But this year its different. I lost my job and have been having a hard time living on unemplyment until the economy picks up. I worked in manufacturing and its hard to get a job this time of year when work loads are slow. So i really really needed my money...      i went to hr block to apply for there line of credit with my paycheck stub. got denied. i got my w2 and applied for the rapid refund. got denied. the lady who did my taxes said i was approved for the 1-2 day return and that i should see my money the following morning on there debit card they gave me. to my surprise, i woke up the next morning to check the balance and 0 dollars...      humm.. i tried to check the status of my return on the phone. no information. then i checked online. i was denied the 1-2 day return and they changed the terms to a 8-15 return. no one called me or notified me of this change. the lady who did my taxes said i was approved. she never told me that i could be denied and that they would change the terms without telling me. so i paid over $200 for a 8-15 day return!! what bad customer service!!! i could have done my taxes online for like $30 and got the same result if i would have known that. i have never been turned down for a instant refund!! when i discovered this, i went down to the office i did my taxes and asked for my tax papers back. they couldnt give them to me and said they were already processed!! i never gave them permission to process this!!!       i hate hr block!! i cant believe they would do this to there customers!! the manager actually told me that 80% of there customers have been denied these returns!! if they would have only told me this, i wouldnt be out of $200 for something i could have done myself!!!      im just venting here and maybe this will help some of you others who are going through the same thing!!
