20090222192140AAPdXDj	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think I have Asperger's?	I am horribly awkward in social situations. I can't make eye contact. I don't like hugs or people in my space. I don't know what to do with my body. I cope by repeatedly moving my foot or leg. I've never had friends. I don't know how to interact. I get obsessed with some things, and that is all I can think about all day long. I do horribly in school because I can't focus, and yet I got an almost perfect score on the SAT. I am very inflexible when it comes to breaking routines. I am obsessively organized.
20090222192613AAgubXC	Social Science;Psychology	Do you avoid people you know when you see them?	I don't know why I do it. I think of myself as a nice person and I like people but when I'm at the store and I see someone I know from work I pretend I don't see them, don't make eye contact and walk away quickly. Obviously if they stopped to talk I would but I would feel uncomfortable. If I could say "hi" and keep walking I would be fine, but its that awkwardness of not knowing what to say that bothers me. Does anyone have any good advice of how I can be friendly without feeling terribly awkward?

20090222193054AAtn0gP	Social Science;Psychology	Do we lose imagination as we age?	So many adults I see view so many things as "childish" and think that they and everyone around them should behave certain "mature, adult-like ways". I know at some point we must grow up and assume responsibility for our actions, think about the future etc, but why do we have to lose the fun we had as kids?      I remember using my imagination so much as a child,  playing with action figures, sticks, sand, marbles. The world was my playground and I would think of great adventures and stories to play around.      I even notice now that when I look up at the clouds I see...clouds. I have fun with life, but not the way I remember as a kid. Must we all "come of age" and mature into the typical adults of our society? Must we all suffer that "loss of innocence" portrayed so often in books and movies?      And I don't mean conforming to society and behaving as everyone else does, but do we naturally "grow up" and lose what made being a kid so much fun?      I don't even really know where I'm going with all this, just something I've been thinking about lately, any comments, advice, personal thoughts appreciated!

Why do some rabidly homophobic heterosexual males accept homosexuality under certain circumstances?      For example: many homophobic men here have answered previously that homosexuality is 'against the bible'  or  'unnatural'  and they have openly admitted that they think gay people should be beaten up or they make comments as such  -   but the same men accept homosexuality if it is presented to them as two pretty lesbians?      Do they accept homosexuality as acceptable - or not?

20090222172838AAkiAJ2	Social Science;Psychology	Why do sadistic, horrible, brutal things appeal to me?	For example the anime Elfen Lied       "Throughout the series, there is a great deal of nudity, blood and gore, extreme graphic violence as well as psychological violence. One of the most prevalent motifs of the series is the humanity of the Diclonius, especially contrasted against the inhumanity of ordinary people. One reviewer described the series as "devoted to quite a few of the darker, more callous factors of human nature".[9] Throughout the series there are various incidences of human sadism, casual beatings, child sexual abuse, animal cruelty, cruel experimentation, and outright killing."      Movies like    Requiem for a dream   Interview with a vampire      My favorite books are one where the main character is taken through unimaginable pain.       Why is that? I'm really not sadistic at all. I'm actually pretty normal except that.

Despite being a geek, he has trouble in school and some learning difficulties. He is kind of rich. We have discussed getting together, and he has made it clear that he wants to sometime. Some guys think i am a babe (not to be conceited). I wear juicy couture, victoria's secret PINK, tiffany's, PUMA, david yurman, etc. Guys that have crushes on me (and my dad too) mimic my valley girl voice.

20090222183921AASrcYD	Social Science;Psychology	Is it bad to have Imaginary Friends?	All through High School I never made an attempt to make real friends and relationships because I always knew I had my Imaginary Friends who'd never betray me.  Nowadays, I'm about 40-50 (I'm not telling you my exact age because I'm afraid of giving too much information to "real" people), I live with my mom in her basement, and I don't know any real people besides my mom, the clerk at the store, and my mailman.  I don't like to talk to any of them except for my mom (whom I continually hit on), and the mailman whom I  hit with a baseball bat if he tries to get to close to my mom.      I don't have any real friends because I have my imaginary friends.  One of them is a Power Ranger (I love that show- I have all the seasons and action figures), one's a dragon (I've always nursed a soft spot when it comes to dragons), one's a mini Hitler in dog form, and one is scary clown who attracts little children into his van by offering them candy.  Although they aren't the best of people, they're fine once you get to know them.      The problem is, my mom has been trying to get my involved with "real" people.  What's the difference between real and imaginary people?  I've lived so long without knowing real people, I think I've forgotten the difference.  Is there one?  What's so great about "real" people?  Real people can hurt you, and scary clown doesn't it like it when I hurt...      I hope I've explained my predicament well enough, so I guess my question is this:  "Is there a problem with how I'm living my life?"  Is there anything wrong with having imaginary friends?  I'm happy how I am, but sometimes I wonder what life would be like with the paranoia and pills I go through everyday.

20090222182646AATDt5y	Social Science;Psychology	How can I love myself if I don't like what I've become?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

Here are my reasons why Im considering calling him EVEN though he did not directly give me his number:      1) We graduated in 08 so we did not have a chance to say how we felt..       2) I am 99 percent certain that at the time he liked me,      3) he would always stare at me, he would ditch other girls if he saw me coming by him, he would take time out of his own lunch to stand there by himself in the SAME area me and my friends were at..       4) he ditched his friends so he could be close to me.. he didnt exacally talk to me because my friend was there      5) He followed me home one time, I also saw a car that looked like his by my driveway and the doorbell rang ( i did not answer it though cause i didnt know what to say if it were to be him)      okay so those are my reasons.. i dunno if there good enough but after seeing him in a crowded area and we locked eyes he looked very sad cause we are not together i think.. so im considering calling him now..      I cant picture him with another girl but me.. me and him were ment to be.. its just i dont know what im going to say to him on the phone so its not akward.. the thing i think he might be creepd out about is the fact that i never had the gets to be so forward with him when he was making an effor to talk to me now all of a sudden im callign him trying to talk to him?? i dont want him to question me.. but im guessing he most likely will..       how should i go about this? and do you think i should go for it?

20090222204542AAOoZjN	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Feminists: Are you worried by the impending collapse of big government?	It is seeming more and more obvious to me that western governments simply cannot continue at their current rate of outrageous spending. No matter what foolish gimmicks they try the only way out of this current mess is to vastly reduce the size of the government. I don't think they're going to die easily though, it will probably be brought about by the governments literally collapsing under the weight of their monstrous debts.      My question to you is this: Does it worry you that since you rely 100% on the state's powers of coercion to further your agenda, you may suffer extremely serious setbacks if the government loses the funds and power to pander to you? If the government withdraws from it's meddling in the free market you'll lose all your affirmative action benefits and women-only job protections. If the government can't foot the ludicrous welfare bill run up by single mothers a lot of unqualified women are going to have to actually try and compete with men in a free labour market for jobs. What happens when all the state bureaucracies pertaining to various women's issues lose their funding? What happens when the government's arms are no longer long enough to interfere on your behalf in every aspect of life and the various pieces of draconian anti-male legislation (such as VAWA or IMBRA) can no longer be enforced?      At least some of you must realize how utterly dependent your movement (and the various 'gains' you have made) is upon state (taxpayer) subsidization and support. In a society run by a small, representative government feminism just couldn't survive. Surely it must be very worrying to you that western governments have spent themselves into bankruptcy and will soon lack the funds or the power to enforce your agenda?

20090222202846AAWLAea	Social Science;Psychology	Odd sense of guilt here:  What's up with this?	So I have a decent job.  Nothing I love, nothing I could ever grow to love, but I don't hate it.  I am looking for a new, different job, something I would like better.  Something that would fit better with who I am, the essence of being me, if you will.  In this economy, with people losing jobs right and left, it feels almost wrong that a person with a viable job should feel like they are "allowed" to want a different job.      Of course, I know better.  But why, then, this sense of guilt?      Thanks all!

Lately i have been having this weired dream...It's been constant and its really bothering me and making me not want to sleep. I have been having this dream about poltergeise activity in my basement where i sleep. Now i know most people are skepticle and say there is no such thing. But just so your people who think that know, poltergeise activity is sometimes a creation of the mind. Meaning it is real and others can see it. Its usually made by the unconscience mind. But i dont think thats my case. In the dreams i see my breath and i keep hearing my voice being called in a really deep bassy voice "John" and its been every night lately except for last night because i went to my grandparents house for the night. So what do you think it means?

20090222202817AANEk8L	Social Science;Psychology	People say I'm too mature for my age. What will happen in my social life?	I'm 19 and a college student at UT Austin. I feel out of touch with reality since I am way too mature for my age. I keep thinking that if I experience all the important things later in life, I would "live" longer. I think life is too short for me. I won't have enough time to do anything meaningful for my significant others and I.      So the thing is that instead of caring only about school or social activities, I also care about finding the right people and setting up a business project.      However, this latter concern puts me at odds with the people I currently meet. I feel more isolated as my expectation of life deviates from the norm. While people I talk to focus on having fun, I'm focusing on something no one would deal with. This has been a source of my unhappiness. I sometimes ask myself "Why do I have to be sad to be happy in a way."      Many have called me wise beyond my age to that of an old man. However, do I have to share this wisdom by myself most of the time?

20090222213257AA25SR7	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Can one every truly know and love oneself?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

20090222212953AAHTAZT	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you think about public Breastfeeding?	I for one don't like it at all (even if it's my wife) I think it's a very personal and private moment between mother and baby. I know most people would assume either I'm anti-woman/mother, or uptight, but i consider myself neither.      I don't like the notion of someone "pulling out" a body part in public for any reason.       I know the arguments that babies must feed, but that's why breast pumps and bottlers were created so you can have a supply when the baby is hungry if you are going to be out.   The simple fact that some people are uncomfortable with it should be reason enough to be considerate of them.      Something being "natural" doesn't qualify it as OK to do in public. And the opinion of it being "beautiful" is subjective...meaning others may disagree, so courtesy would point to not exposing them to it.      What do you think?

20090222211948AAUBcLj	Social Science;Psychology	I watched someone die yesterday and can't stop thinking about it..?	I work at a home improvement center and yesterday I got pulled over by a customer and his family asking questions in another department. I knew a bit about the product but I decided to go walk over to that departments desk and get someone that could answer their questions better.      On my way back to the aisle, I come to see the customer on the ground not breathing and unresponsive, 2 other co-workers were getting there just as I did and my manager called 911. I stood there and watched his daughter attempt CPR with no success and later the EMTs came and after 40 or so minutes could not revive him.      The thing is, I'm in my 3rd year of pre-med courses in school right now, and even though I'm not CPR certified I think I should have had the daughter step aside and saw what I could do before the paramedics got there. I've just been feeling immense guilt about the whole thing the past 2 days and can't get the image of him dying out of my head.      This isn't the first time I've been around a dead body, but this is however the first time that i've talked and joked with a person and then minutes later watched them die.       Anybody out there got any advice? I know it isn't my fault that he died, but I can't stop feeling guilty and find myself thinking about the situation every time I'm not busy.
