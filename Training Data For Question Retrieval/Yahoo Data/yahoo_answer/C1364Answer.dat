XWPOUafmaa	The term psychologist is the umbrella term used to group psychologists which specialise in many fields of psychology. There are many different types of psychologists, as is reflected by the 56 different divisions of the American Psychological Association (the APA).<br>  <br>  Counseling psychology is one area of psychology. Others include occupational, educational, clinical, environmental, organisational, etc.<br>  <br>  When laymen refer to someone as a psychologist, they are generally speaking of counseling or clinical psychologists.|`|7fa0FWu2aa	CLICK ON THE THIN BLUE LINE, AND THEN CLICK THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON TO CHANGE TO THE NEXT SLIDE: <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&as_q=psychologist+counselling+psychologist&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&num=10&lr=&as_filetype=ppt&ft=i&as_sitesearch=&as_qdr=all&as_rights=&as_occt=any&cr=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&safe=images" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&as_...</a>|`|6fvR8J9Kaa	a counselling psychologist will give advice and will need to study counselling as well as psychology. there are different areas in psychology but a counselling psychologist will basically be helping people and giving them useful advice|`|xif22nwoaa	Psychology encompasses many areas, and most psychologists actually aren't therapists.  The areas of psychology dealing with therapy are clinical and counseling.  Other areas include developmental, neuropsychology, industrial/organizational, biopsychology, social, etc.  There are numerous psychology fields, and those professionals are all psychologists.<br>  <br>  To practice as either a counseling or clinical psychologist, you would need an undergraduate degree in psychology and then at least a master's degree.  There are only a few states that will allow you to get a license as a master's-level clinical or counseling psychologist, and only after many years of supervision.  Most require you to have a doctorate for a license, which is what will allow you to practice privately.<br>  <br>  A clinical psychologist usually focuses on diagnosed psychological disorders (clinical depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, etc), while counseling psychologists typically focus on more general problems, such as family and marital problems, less severe anxieties, etc.<br>  <br>  You can also get a degree in just counseling (not part of psychology), where the focus is also on more general issues.  You can become a licensed counselor with just a master's degree in most areas.  You need a graduate degree to be any type of licensed therapist though.

F6uAWBluaa	Marc Lepine went on a killing spree, shouting "I Hate feminists" as he shot innocent female students in an engineering department. He thought women "took" these slots from males --- even though the dept had more males than females.<br>  <br>  sound familiar?<br>  <br>  As far as women "killing" millions - uh, doctors, technically, do the killing - many of whom are male. And, uh, I hate to blow the whole stork story, but, um, men IMPREGNATE women - some women are even impregnated by sexual violence and dont have a say at all about their pregnancy. Many men influence the decision of whether or not the woman keeps the baby -my friend's husband influenced her to get 2 abortions. So...sorry, men are not innocent in your so-called "killing spree" -- I happen to call it reproductive freedom. Until you can come up with an idea as to what to do with 24,000 un-adopted children and how the world can have unlimited resources, I think I"ll side with pro-choice.  Hate to take that "contempt for women" power from you, but I'd say it would be more useful eslewhere. <br>  <br>  <br>  And to those talking about the "evil" radical feminists, have you had a look at the PIG PAGE in the Liz Library?<br>  <br>  <br>  Have you read the recent article on LEE DOYLE ---- another Fathers Rights activist busted for child sexual abuse --- you guys fall like flies in unvented window. <br>  <br>  The pot calling the kettle black INDEED.<br>  <br>  <br>  TAKE BACK THE FORUM .....

Any more than the author of the S.C.U.M. (Society for Cutting Up Men) Manifesto, Valerie Solanis, (the woman who shot Andy Warhol) is a spokesperson for the legitimate feminist movement. <br>  I very much doubt that any right thinking person would condone any act of violence, let alone endeavour to justify it by reason of it being a positive affirmation of a succinct philosophical viewpoint.|`|AHJZeo8Oaa	Woah, no way did I know about this.  There are anti-feminist mass-murderers now?  This is getting scary.<br>  <br>  Reading some of the anti-feminist justifications on here is really worrying - are they so blind they can't see what their hate movement is leading to?<br>  <br>  Anti-feminist boards should be checked for incitement to violence / murder and posters prosecuted where necessary.  It's disgusting that writers like Dworkin, who never physically harmed a person in their life, are compared  / used as a justification for scum like Lepine.  Just goes to show that anti-fems can say what they like about solanas - I don't see any feminists going into schools and killing students.  Yet one of their group does it, and they're free to disown him as nothing to do with them?  Crazy.|`|DEc1C9hkaa	Who the hell is Marc Lepine?<br>  <br>  I represent myself, whether or not I do a good job of it is a matter of opinion.<br>  <br>  I googled...<br>  Apparently he's an actual misogynist, not the G&WS definition of a misogynist.|`|PILm2U4Taa	Makes sense to me... if they want to insist that Andrea Dworkin is the face of feminism, then they get that guy slapped on them.

Why do they say he wasn't an "official" member of their "tribe" when he said many of the things repeated here in this YA forum by those against feminism and he said the same things quite a few MRA web sites and blogs say? Because they don't want to admit that there are violent anti-feminists in their midst and in society, who did and do kill women, who do use the words and anger expressed in forums like this to justify violence, and they don't want to admit that these men kill women because they hate women. These killers then give their "excuse" for their hatred of women is because of feminism. I'd say that there is a good correlation there between angry words against feminists and women affecting angry men to act on their anger violently, against feminists and women. <br>  <br>  Here's what Marc Lepine did:<br>  "You're all a of bunch of feminists!" the man shouted, his eyes now alight with anger. "And I hate feminists!"<br>  <br>  This time, he ordered the women to get up from their seats and the men to leave. A few moved to obey, but others remained confused. When the 10 women had moved into the specified corner, the gunman explained his reason for being there. According to survivors who spoke later to police or reporters, he told them that he was there on behalf of males. "I'm fighting feminism." Women had been taking employment and opportunities away from men, he said, and feminists needed to be taught their place. <br>  <br>  Nathalie Provost tried to tell him that they were not necessarily feminists, but this only enraged him. He lifted the rifle again and, as they screamed for mercy or tried to leap out of range, he methodically shot them from left to right. All were hit. Provost was shot three times.<br>  <br>  Then the gunman came out and strode past them. No one tried to stop him. No one dared. He aimed the rifle precariously at them and they backed away, allowing him to leave. He fired at several other students on that floor, and three more were hit, including two women. Then he continued on his way.<br>  <br>  The authorities soon learned that the suicidal gunman was Marc Lépine. It would take a while to piece together why he had caused so much slaughter, but he had stated enough about his intent for students to tell reporters that his rampage had been anti-feminist. He had wanted to shoot only women.<br>  <br>  Lépine's stated intention of killing feminists as a political statement, and as a way to scare women back to their traditional roles, shocked people around the world. Yet it was not the first such hate-inspired massacre. Like others before it and still to come, it was fueled by a frustration that can build into a hardened anger and a need to blame an outside person."<br>  <br>  In a letter to the press, here is Lepine's justification for his actions, sound familiar?:<br>  "The feminists always have a talent for enraging me. They want to retain the advantages of being women...while trying to grab those of men... They are so opportunistic that they neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men throughout the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can."<br>  <br>  Here's who Lepine had decided were radicals-sound familiar?<br>  It came out later that in his suicide note, Lépine had included an "Annex," a list of the names of 19 "radical feminists" mentioned in newspapers, from police women to politicians, but had decided that he had no time to execute them all. He had even included their phone numbers, indicative of his detailed awareness of them. But in the end, in an act of mass murder, he had decided to make one clear statement, a symbolic attack on women everywhere, represented in those females trying to get ahead in occupations meant, Lépine believed, only for males.<br>  <br>  All of the quotes were from: "Gendercide: The Montreal Massacre":<br>  From <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/marc_lepine/6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notor...</a>|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	When anti-feminists say things like, feminism has ruined the economy because with too many people in the labour market wages have gone done, they are using the exact same argument as Lepine.<br>  <br>  He felt he couldn't get into university because women made less spots available, and therefore he hated feminism for keeping him left out.<br>  <br>  So these guys may think because they don't kill others they're not like Lepine, but the feeling as though women should step aside to make life easier for less qualified men are eerily similar.|`|WkLJI40baa	I haven't heard or read a non feminist here advocating the murder of women.

swiOhDo2aa	Nobody really knows what dreams are for. All we know is that all mammals dream - watch your dog or cat move, make sucking motions like a baby, twitch as though running etc. when asleep - so dreams probably serve some purpose; i.e. they are not merely random fragments of experience the mind accidentally reruns during sleep. If they were not adaptive, they would not be so universal.<br>  <br>  One thing we can dismiss is that dreams systematically and reliably foretell the future. A|lthough many of us have had dreams which later on came true, we have also had thousands which did not. Pure chance probably accounts for the minority.<br>  <br>  Freud though that dreams were a useful psychoanalytic tool in that they represented mental activity uncensored by the conscious mind. This may be true, but other schools of psychiatry have not generally found the study of dreams useful.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|BtxmMd7Caa	It has to do with your imagination and trends of thoughts. And most of the time you could recall characters in your dream as someone you know. It's because your mind still work while ur sleep and these people you know in your memory might be fused into a scene unnecessary that they know each other neither.<br>  Hope that helps|`|i3w1G65Baa	no proof but i think dreams are things that we want or fantisize about, and things that we're afraid of.|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	No, there is no proof.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	It's impossible to prove if dreams are meaningful just as it is impossible to prove that life is meaningful.  It is subjective.  The only way we know what dreams mean is by the dreamer agreeing that it signifies something interpreted.  Dream interpretation is criticized as relying on the yes effect, the tendency for people to agree with whatever they hear or what they feel an expert is saying.  <br>  From what dream interpreters tend to say, dreams often reflect what a person is dealing with in their present life.  It often sums their life course and situation.  Researchers have said for a long time that we process, store, and discard daily memories when we sleep.  So it fits that we are modifying our cognitive map of how the world works when we sleep.<br>  Dreams also appear to serve as warnings for what might happen and wish fulfillment for good things that could happen.  We can tell something about ourselves by looking at what we really want and fear.
VjUqAZuUaa	I cry pretty often; I would have to disagree a little with the person who said crying shows weakness. It doesn't. Crying is a good thing.<br>  I cry when I fail, I cry when I succeed (particularly when I got my results for my GCSEs), I cry when I'm angry as I hate confrontations, I cry when I'm frustrated with myself for not being able to do something, I cry when I'm really excited (like when I went to see Strictly Live... which is a little worrying), I cry when I watch sad shows like the series finale of Doctor Who when my favourite character had her memory wiped, I cry when I'm uber happy, I cry when I'm uber sad.<br>  Don't get me wrong, a lot of these incidences are just tears-welling-up-in-the-eyes moments but I really think it's important to cry now and again to release things. I always feel much better after crying, it's soothing in a way. Your tears are yours to shed when you want to so I don't think anyone should ever be ashamed of their tears.|`|UDl8Ac76aa	I cried quite ofter. Mostly because of sad thing, depressing thing, when I am happy and touched by someone kindness, when I watched touching drama or movie. I have so many reasons to cry but sometimes I cried over nothing. Just the feeling want to cry.|`|Utkdzgfgaa	Man now that you asked this, I don't remember when I last cried, I am a rather strong person, and in my book crying is sign of weakness. However you are right, with crying you do endure pressures and pain way better, but I.... it's just I never cry, maybe I should try sometimes =]<br>  <br>  So yeah my answer would be I never cry and the reason is that I am very hard and realistic person, crying won't solve anything.|`|i3w1G65Baa	very few times, and when things seem to be out of my control.|`|YdJJ9wQTaa	I cry every time I laugh, but the only other things that can make me cry are my parents. I don't every cry a couple of tears, I completely break down and I'm useless for a couple of hours or until the next morning. <br>  <br>  Since I've been away from my parents at college, I haven't cried because I'm depressed for over 6 months. Life is really good. In high school it would be every other week, more if report cards were out.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Roots made me cry. The only TV show or movie to do so that I can think of right now. I watched all the episodes in one sitting then just bawled for a couple of hours.
iUzSlmSbaa	You are seeing your therapist about the sexual abuse.. Be absolutely honest with her and mention this development and that this guy is living next door to your best friend.. tell her that this frightens you a lot and ask her for her advice.. that's what she is there for .. thats also what she gets paid for and don't hide this fear from her.<br>  <br>  Ideally you would go to the police, even at this late date. As you know and can identify the guy who did this to you. he belongs in prison. Nobody can force you to take this brave step. It would definitely mean that the whole case opens up again and that there will be a trial.. so ask her for advise.. if you want to see your friend.. tell her that you won't go near that house and tell her the reason.. that you only meet her elsewhere... because the guy who sexually abused you lives next door. Also alert your friend to the fact that this guy lives next door to her.. not that she becomes a victim of him as well.. because once a rapist always a rapist.. if he gets away with it.. which is why it would be a brave move to go to the police and tell them that you know the guy who sexually abused you.. stick by what you say and that would be a way to keep him from doing this again.. if you feel you are too vulnerable to have to go through all this again, then talk to your therapist.. tell her that going to the police is no option.. and ask her for advice.. also tell your friend that the guy who sexually abused you in the summer is right next door to her.. that you can't go there again.. that you like to see her.. but that you are not going to her place again.. that you always have to meet elsewhere.. also make her aware that this guy is dangerous..  that she better not talk to him.. not admit him to the house where she lives.. I doublt he will attack her in front of his aunt's house...in the evenings if she goes out or if you go out.. carry a loud whistle and a can of hair spray if you can't get pepper spray.. if you are being followed by that guy.. or she is.. use it at the right moment.. <br>  <br>  I am sure he is totally unaware that you saw him.. tell your therapist first thing.. ask her what to do what other ways there are to get over this if you feell you can't get through with going to the police...xxx plus tell your friend why you are not visiting her place anymore.. and warn her about him|`|eq820Audaa	Was he prosecuted?

You may not cry in "reality" but in "fantasy" which is your dreams. You are still hurting. You may act normal in real life, but your true feelings are showing up in your dreams. You should try to talk about how you feel with someone that you trust. <br>  <br>  You may have repressed yourself to deal with it by being strong. But even the strongest person breaks down and cries sometimes. It doesn't mean that you are no longer strong; it means you are human and have feelings and am learning how to deal with emotions.<br>  <br>  You have been so used to "sucking it up" and holding all your feelings inside. I relate to that because I am like that also. But eventually you will explode. So before you do, slowly try to let it out. Even if you don't talk to someone, write down how you feel. Bottling up your feelings is not healthy. Try to find an emotional release that will be beneficial to you and your life.|`|AA12360662	Crying is an emotional behavior.  Some people don't show it and some just show it very obvious.<br>  <br>  In your case, you don't really cry reality may just mean in reality you have this strong feeling to show your emotion.  Dreaming that you cry basically means you have the need to release your emotion.  Due to the fact that you are a strong person in reality, things you may hide from others will not be able to hide from within your subconscious mind.<br>  <br>  Of course, it all depends on dreams, but most of the times, crying in dreams reflects your sadness and unhappiness. Unless you cry because you were too happy.|`|JCozkN7faa	your subconcious is saying that deep down you still miss your dad!<br>  <br>  I have cried many times in my dreams and it was usually when I saw my dad.<br>  <br>  My Dad died too last year in May! in my dreams of him before I would always cry when I saw him and hug him and now when i see him in dreams I don't cry but we talk(which I miss doing with him).

I read the Third Chimp decades ago.  I agree with his conclusions that we are extremely closely related.  It is somewhat arbitrary to split us there.  We might as well be included with gorillas as well, maybe call them the four hugorchimps.   I found Collapse, (I only read portions of it) to be too gloom and doom and not nearly as interesting or scientific as GG&S.  I found GG&S chocked full of interesting anthropology info.  The other two were far more speculative IMO.
TPN1yIj7aa	different people bring out different qualities in all of us. some people are so up themselves that they annoy the life out of me, where as some people are lovely and i find myself wanting to be with them and so i act friendly and talkative. some people make me feel unsure of myself and shy. it really depends on how you see yourself and if you're ever worried about what people think of you.|`|7jM9Ghchaa	not really as if I do not like anyone I do not sit in there company?|`|zdu3gh8jaa	I'm very much with carla b on this one - good on you carla, don't change for anyone.<br>  <br>  I believe that there may be people more experienced than me but no one is better than me, and although I may be more experienced in some areas than others, I'm not better than others. I tend to treat everyone I meet the same - if they don't like it they don't have to talk to me again.|`|AA12231462	Yes - the why is that I have DID and other peoples structures trigger this system into finding the right person for their structure. So we are totally blown aroudn by the needs of others.I manage the whole system by being very careful who I meet and trying to make sure that it is a known quantity.<br>  <br>  How is that for example someone wants to take out heir disappointments in life on someone  a scapegoat will be called up - If someone want s to play a child will be called up  and so on - it can get a bit hectic when there are different needs at the same time so I am careful usually to meet people singly.|`|Y5jiOlAUaa	I try to keep it real but sometimes i have met people whom i have clashed with, and they don't like you for your views, so try to learn to adjust and not show too much sense or sensibility. Business relationship at work, depending on the nature of the work, and with genuine friends  can be open and yourself without fear of them attacking/disbelieving or causing any upset. But those conventions and rules are fine but hard to implement into everyday life.  Have a duty and protective need to conceal emotions to deflect criticism, or any conflict. Show your good side at all times, but mindful of bad side. You need more than rules in life.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	well mine doesn't. i am who i am. but there are those who want to be someone there not, to impress. or to fit in.|`|IAkEyPb9aa	Yes.<br>  Its entirely appropriate that it does because it is clear we understand the rules of social intercourse if we do.<br>  If we just behaved as we felt like with no consideration of the other person this would be messy and inappropriate.<br>  If we modify our behaviour inappropriately this can cause problems also.|`|hhHbdKRaaa	I am pretty much not bothered what people think of me and confident that my behaviour is pretty satisfactory, however, i also have an urge not to offend, or an urge to please certain people, therefore my behaviour does change in relation to who I am with and where I am eg.<br>  <br>  If I am with the vicar (which I often am) I am polite and certain subjects are avoided, but if I am with the same vicar in the pub (which I often am) a lot of those subjects return to the agenda when appropriate.<br>  <br>  With my employer I behave one way but with my friends I do behave differently. Equally when I worked as a manager, in the workplace I met certain expectations but with my workforce in the canteen I modified my language so as not to 'offend' them - speaking in local dialect and entering their conversations at their level.<br>  <br>  The world is a stage and everyone is an actor playing their role!|`|Utkdzgfgaa	Yes! And it's really hard to explain, around some people I am rather serious, but with certain amount of people I know well I am whole different and not so serious.

xif22nwoaa	It can mean lots of things.<br>  <br>  There are several aspects of the memory system - sensory register, short-term memory, and long-term memory.<br>  <br>  There are also types of memory, such as autobiographical memory (remembering events about your life), procedural memory (memory for physical skills such as tying shoes, riding bikes, etc), and so forth.|`|6h30kGjDaa	like there can be good great bad awful etc|`|cgdJRzj8aa	that means there are different categories.<br>  One way of categorising is by the length of time a memory is retained for. E.g. Sensory register,short-term or working memory and long-term memory.<br>  And another way is by content. E.g<br>  Visual,auditory,semantic,tactical,peri... memory etc.
iUzSlmSbaa	I agree with it.. it sounds like a simple partial seizure have a brain scan done.. tell your doctor..  he should arrange an EEG<br>  <br>  <br>  Simple partial seizures<br>  <br>  People who have simple partial seizures stay awake and aware but may hear, see, smell, or taste things that aren't real. They may also suddenly feel afraid, angry, happy or sad for no reason. They may become confused or experience jerking or tingling in an arm or leg. <br>  <br>  <br>  Complex partial seizures. <br>  <br>  Complex partial seizures usually begin with a blank stare that indicates a brief loss of consciousness. People who have these seizures may blink, twitch, chew or smack the lips repeatedly. They may seem drunk, express exaggerated anger or fear, and throw things around. They may struggle against restraint. These seizures usually last no more than two minutes.|`|SBoPBsoOaa	Hmm... I'd recomend seeing a doctor or something. I don't think you're going crazy exactly ( I mean, if you woke up or snapped out of it five miles away and you were wearing lipstick and rogue, that'd be a little disconcerning... lol) but snapping out for a few minutes is a little concerning. You'll probably want to kick this thing in the bud so that when you drive you won't have to worry about it.<br>  <br>  Drifting off for a few seconds, maybe even a few minutes is normal, it's just the way our brains are. Most of us can return our focus back. If you're having problems, I'd really recommend just asking a doctor about it. I'm not saying that you're dying or that it's serious, but it's best to just get these things checked out just in case. :)|`|26a776c1daa6850107752c2d949cd100aa	The same thing happened to my sister-in-law when she was younger.  She turned out to be epileptic.  Now that she is on a daily medicine, it does not happen anymore.  Go see a doctor.  Good luck.|`|XErmOf0yaa	You should see a doctor, it could be a type of seizure, which in turn is doing your brain irreparable damage.|`|3kHi9YbAaa	i think maybe you should see somebody about it, possibly a doctor or a specialist.|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Get your doctor to refer you to a neurologist.  I watched a special on people who spaced out like this for days at a time.  They couldn't feel pins or anything.  They were declared dead and woke up in morgues.   You definitely want to get that checked out.

aihogb26aa	Training your brain to think in a more positive manner actually takes a lot of attention and practice, but there are whole theories in psychology and counseling that are devoted to this. Some of the more basic ideas are:<br>  - Start a gratitude journal- Each day (or several times a day, especially in the morning or at night), record some of the specific things that you are grateful for that day<br>  - When you feel yourself thinking negatively,  find a way to stop yourself. Some people say the word "Stop" out loud, others will actually wear a rubber band and snap it to distract themselves.<br>  - Try a gratitude meditation, or even a basic breathing meditation. This can help you to calm your mind and helps you to practice pushing worrisome or negative thoughts away. It teaches you how to practice more control over your thoughts and your body<br>  - Try asking yourself, " What is the evidence against this thought?" when a negative thought comes into your brain. For example, if you find yourself thinking, "No one likes me". Try proving that thought wrong or almost arguing with yourself against that negative thought. Try coming up with specific examples of people who have enjoyed spending time with you, or who have shown care towards you or have been friendly.<br>  <br>  Also, when you first wake up, or right before you go to bed, try to limit the information or images you come across that may cause stress or negative feelings. For example, you may want to avoid watching the news or reading the newspaper or books with heavy topics right before you go to bed or right after you wake up. Maybe read a quote or self affirmation that makes you feel good, or look at a picture that calms you.|`|W7SGgAPjaa	by thinking more positive|`|4191bf22931e9cc7e405f80b732d50fbaa	I will give you an example of how this can be achieved... if you find something in a negative realm, you have the choice to turn that negative into a positive by finding something in the negative that is on the end of a positive note.This takes a lot of energy to re group from all the negative influences of today;era. But it can be achieved. Because I have succeeded in this area. It has taken years to accomplish,and stay in tuned with. wishing you all the best of positiveness.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Your action toward a accomplishment is a positive thing.Smile at others.When they are lifted up you become energized.Make statements that talk well of others and always move forward toward a solution.Eat well and consume a multi vitamin as this will help in positive thinking.I am getting better and better each and every day and things are working out well for me.I awake with a smile and talk well of others.My kindness generates people that help me to become more successful.I am having a great day and I am happy.

3F3y00ipaa	Thank you so much for asking. i have been blind for six years and through residual memory, i usually dream in images. For me, it is a beautiful experience, because at least in that realm i have my "sight" back. i do dream sometimes in only auditory senses though, a phenomenon that is happening more often as the years go by since i lost my eyesight. Those people i know in a support group who have been blind all their lives dream this way exclusively.|`|DsEEATKSaa	Yes, all people (regardless of sightedness) dream.<br>  <br>  No, a person born blind does not experience vision in waking or dreaming states.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|80V7RxwQaa	i think so.<br>  <br>  but it just won't be as realistic.

145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	You're over-anylizing the situation instead of just letting things happen.  Its the anticipation that's killing you, not the event itself.  Just walk over and say hello.

If he's flirting with you than he's obviously somewhat interested. Just be yourself. Don't like think of things to say to him before hand. I've done that before and it just sounds wrong when I say it or it just doesn't fit into the conversation we're having. Just don't stress about it. He likes you so be yourself and go for it!
5bjm3qesaa	There are 2 types of deja vu: firstly, the type described above for example when you have a flashback of something that happened to you years ago. Secondly, there is the sort of experience people have when they have dreamt or 'seen' something happen before, which is associated with being psychic. This is quite widely debated and doubted as it is very difficult to prove to other people. However I do believe that it exists, as I have some friends who have told me about their experiences.|`|SBoPBsoOaa	No I don't think so. Deja vu could just be someone who goes to the store and picks up a can of strawberry soda and suddenly has a flashback of buying it when they were five years old. Or they dream about going to the circus and the next day they are offered tickets to a circus. Seems psychic but that stuff isn't real.<br>  <br>  If it was, you'd see a headline in the newspaper... "PSYCHIC WINS THE LOTTERY!"|`|XstaAKLLaa	I don't think so. sometimes everyone experiences deja vu but surely not everyone is psychic.|`|3sbjV043aa	Theres definitely a connection.but i dont what.
xif22nwoaa	Temperament is made up of a baby's reactivity (which includes motor activity, emotional reactions, and attention - quickness and intensity of these factors) and self-regulation (baby's ability to modify or control reactivity).<br>  <br>  It's most commonly measured by asking parents to rate their infant's behavior in various everyday situations.  So when baby is playing, how often to they get frustrated, attend to one toy for an extended period, laugh out loud, etc.  They are asked about playtime, bathtime, feeding time, sleeping time, meeting new people, etc - lots of situations that babies encounter most days.
HsX4H0FLaa	Vivid dreams are one of the commonest side-effects. If they are to the extent that you are becoming confused (another possible side-effect) about whether you are awake or asleep, then perhaps that might be something to discuss with your doctor?|`|MlshtGVTaa	i took prozac for a year and had some really crazy dreams but this was right after my mom died. it might but then again it might not but i know how it is. <br>  sorry i could answer your question but knowing that it happened to someone else helps too

There are sometimes great differences financially between those who live in cities  and those who do not.  Rural living is typically on a greater land mass.  This costs more and often incurs higher taxes. Many rural dwellers have sizable bank accounts.   City dwellers can sometimes live in cheap nasty apartments.  As you have also pointed out, country dwellers tend to be more deliberate and think things through before acting.  Observing some of the businesses that thrive in the city, you could say the opposite may be true of city dwellers.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	It depends on what "country" you are talking about. I believe you are talking about the deep south redneck country that everyone stereotypes. Country is a wide open space. <br>  I have come to believe the "city people" are more like sheep & don't listen to their conscience. They only care about appearances, i.e. clothes, houses, etc.<br>  The cost of living is higher in larger cities so they can afford these nicer things, but we "country folk" have learned about farmin & investin that green paper we got for using our brains, even when the cost of livin is a bit less down here. <br>  <br>  Basically the cost of living is diffrent by state & when you go to a larger population there will always be more jobs. You city folk should know that bein smarter & all. Why don't all us country folk want to move to cities? Sometimes the country is nice, we have family here (yes family IS important), and sometimes money is tight (just can't buy that new escalade right now).|`|eV6MHADQaa	I can tell u r city get out in  the country and stop. turn off the cell blackberry shut off the car and you will find a whole side of yourself that you have been missing

aihogb26aa	If you're referring to the tendency of one gender to develop certain mental illnesses more frequently than another, then yes, research has uncovered some links. Men tend to have an onset of symptoms earlier in some illnesses, especially schizophrenia (men tend to have onset from teens to 20's, women tend to have onset from early 20's to mid 30's). Previous research has found that schizophrenia is more prevalent in men than in women, but that has been disputed recently. Major depressive disorder is twice as common for women. Alcohol dependence is more common in men, as is some presonality disorders, including antisocial personality disorder (three times as likely for men than women). However, all of these findings are constantly being researched and re-tested, and are often disputed.|`|SBoPBsoOaa	I'm not exactly sure what you mean... um.. girls do mature faster than boys...|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Women are mentally sane.

9okusH1kaa	Homeless people will often live under bridges or in open sewer or drainage pipes (the big underground ones, look for outlets at your local sump) These areas will help trap the heat from fires. If there are condemned buildings or broken down vehicles they may also reside there. When begging they will stick close to the main street, but there is a lot less money to be made there than in a city. They may also try selling scrap metal and minor theft.<br>  <br>  The biggest issue will be keeping themselves supplied with their drug of choice. In rural areas, that will be limited to alcohol or meth because other drugs are generally more expensive in rural areas and the addict will travel to suburbs or a city in order to increase his supply. <br>  <br>  Hygiene is not really that important to an adult and its usually adults that comprise the homeless population. A person can survive in filthy conditions. Women and children are more susceptible to illnesses from lack of hygiene and will probably die if they don't receive aid. That is why homeless shelters are more open to women and children than men. Toothaches and other pains stemming from poor hygiene can be ignored easily when you're using drugs. <br>  <br>  Most homeless are smart enough to move to the city at the first opportunity. That is where you must go to make money panhandling(begging). A beggar in the subways in NY can make 100,000 dollars a year. Beggars in NY, Chicago and other big cities can often earn enough money to kill themselves with overdoses in a single day, which is a lot less possible in the suburbs or a rural area.|`|3M1R22zraa	I think to really understand the homeless, you'd have to put yourself in their shoes...or at least talk to a few...<br>  <br>  I live in a rural area, I've never seen or heard of homeless people here, but that doesn't mean there aren't any. I think if you live in a rural area it's because your family has lived there for generations, so there's more chance of getting help when needed, instead of having to living on the streets.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	why dont you drive around your town and look for a homeless guy. take a few friends with you, buy him lunch and ask him if you can interview him.|`|L38sFy7waa	Homeless survive depending on others, asking money buy really economic things, the biggest task is not hygiene is money, hunger, starvation, and also they may loose they're mind and get loopy, depression, they also feel rejected for other when they ask for money and people in the cars ignore him that very humiliating, they sleep on the ground in a really private area such as inside corners hidden areas of course close where they ask for money, the usually are on the streets, they have also said that they cant progress because they abuse of the drug such as cocaine crack well but in my place they are a lot of homeless people, what my parents always says is that
24H5tznkaa	When I had depression, I didn't think much about anything. That was the problem. When you get really deep down, you just stop feeling and it's a dangerous place to be. When you are able to feel sad and cry, that is a good thing because you are coming up a level. When you get angry, that's even better because it takes energy and will to get angry. <br>  <br>  Now that I have learned how to stop myself from getting depressed, I think about...well, I think about how alive I feel and how happy I am to be alive. When I make my bed and I crawl under the covers at night, I am thankful for my bed and how comfortable I am. When I am having strong emotions because of some situation, I am happy to feel something so strongly.<br>  <br>  I don't know...I think that depression really helped me to appreciate the simple things in life because I went all the way down and came back up...and it turns out that it's the simple things in life that really matter. I don't even mind the rain anymore. :)<br>  <br>  BTW, if you suffer from depression, email me and I will send you the tips that I learned that brought me out of it.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Will have it the rest of my life.  Must learn to live with it.  NO Cure in my case.  Have never thought of myself as lesser that anyone and probably won't.  My condition is not progressive.  Simple brain damage and irreversible.  Able to compensate using adjustment rehabilitation.  Motorcycle wreck.  Cracked helmet with head still inside.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I currently suffer from post traumatic stress, which includes depression. I'm in an up phase at the moment. Meaning I can function at the moment. But... when the depression was at it's highest, I felt like i was in a black hole. It was deep and it was dark and I felt like I'd never get out of it. I didn't care about anything. I didn't want to do anything. All I wanted to do was sleep. I was in so deep so that I had no reason TO be tired. Meaning, I could tell you that sleeping was easier than dealing with the stuff I had to deal with, but that would be a lie. Witchy Mel is right... I simply felt nothing. I checked out. <br>  <br>  When I started to come up from that... I hated myself. I hated my life. I was worthless and I couldn't understand why God had given me such a life. What had I done to deserve this? <br>  <br>  I'm at the point now where I don't hate my life, and I don't hate me. But I'm not happy with me either. I know I didn't do anything to deserve what happened. It was done TO me. But it still hurts nonetheless. I still feel incredibly screwed up. And that's hard to deal with, it's depressing in itself b/c I can't see a way out of it. And it inhabits every facet of who I am, not just a part of me, ALL of me. It IS who I am. So, I'm at the point where I need to let it go, but I can't. Because how do you let go of something that defined who you are? How do you let go of something you can't even remember? <br>  <br>  So, I still can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. BUT... I have faith that it's there. I have faith that someday I will see it.|`|RvND5eNfaa	When i had Depression i felt no matter what happened to me i deserved it! i didn't like myself at all and thought everyone would be better off without me, everything was my fault and i felt i was useless.I was scared to get up in the mornings and just wanted to sleep so i could stop feeling. You feel your never going to get out of it. BUT you can, and i did. You need motivation,determination,and stimulation. Get out there and do something new, something you have always wanted to do, but you need to make yourself do it and keep telling yourself you can do it. Now i feel i am worth more, i can do that, and that its OK to make mistakes. I still hurt inside sometimes but i feel happier with me.x<br>  P.S i have to agree with witchy Mel that i have also learnt something from depression and that's to feel more towards others (empathy,sympathy and understanding). In a way it may sound a little strange but i am thankful i went through depression because it has made me who i am today. I guess its taking a positive out of the negative.

I have never tried to define feminism because each feminist I know, either personally, or through my research has a slightly different slant on how they define feminism.  I define myself as an intelligent, capable, woman who enjoys my gender, makes sound and many times difficult decisions, can change a tire, change the oil in my auto, garden, clean the house, cook, do finish carpenter work, lay ceramic tile, do interior plumbing repair and changes, ya know, most of the things many women do.  I maintain my physical appearance because I like to look good, and have personal pride.  I have a wonderful guy who truly appreciates me, and who occasionally meets me at the door wearing  only an apron.  He has a really cute butt, and  great legs.  We laugh together a lot, and really have no sex roles.  So, to me, the philosophy behind feminism is just that.  No categorized sex roles.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I've never seen anything about her saying anything about feminism and what she did to me doesn't have anything really to do with feminism either so... =o/<br>  <br>  Never seen her mentioned to do with feminism either until you just now.

Take some classes in philosophy because your arguments are really lame.

You already completed your general and breadth requirements for English, science, etc., (probably equivalent to the first two years of college. You only need do that once. Since Marketing is also a social science, perhaps some of those courses might apply to your counseling psych degree.<br>  <br>  All you would need do is complete the courses required for a psychology BA or BS in counseling psych. Perhaps you can do that as a second Bachelor degree, transferring in your general ed. courses. Also look at a sample MA/MS degree program in counseling psychology to make sure you're taking all the needed courses at the right level.<br>  <br>  You should make an appointment to talk with your college's academic adviser to discuss your best approach. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DsEEATKSaa	Unfortunately, yes.<br>  <br>  It is likely that you would need to begin again (as far as the psych major - the rest of your general ed courses should be fine).<br>  <br>  Sorry to be the bearer of ill news,<br>  ~Dr. B.~<br>  <br>  p.s.

In addition, you would need to get some work and/or research experience n the field to add further support for your application.

No one knows when death comes. In fact, we should be happy to face death. Its the freedom from this world full of terror and contamination. Love all around you. Your thought of death would never have a space in your mind. If you get depressed, you are again hurting your own baby. I could only see you as a very good care taker and you love your family very much. You think about death because you love your son very much. Your love is so extreme that you could not bear anything bad to happen to your beloved ones. Wow..!!!! I give you a bow for your love and affection.Enjoy the present times with your family, help your son to fight this damn world. Its you the MOM , who can lead him safely. Who else can do best? If you are depressed then who will be a role model for your son? Since you have cried enough, it would be easy for you now to just throw of your death thoughts. Look around you. Look at your cute son. He is healthy now. Have good thoughts and deeds around your son and your growing baby. Read good books and articles. Watch romantic and comedy movies or serials. Hear to your 2 year old son's talk. He tries to learn new words, new things. Show him the love..teach him the good things of life. You will be engaged in good things and will not have death thoughts. You are now 19th week in your pregnancy. You can know your baby gender if you wish in couple of weeks. Wow!!! Are you not excited??? Congrats on your pregnancy. Do you wish for boy like your first son or doyou wish for a girl? There are lot of good things to think of. If you cant get rid of your thoguhts, then who else can. You love would certainly help you get out of your thoughts.  All the best.

Your desire is what constitutes "you" and your thoughts are not "you" so much as a tool of fulfilling "you".

In addition, "several hundred" survivors were expected to die from radiation-induced cancers and lukemia over the next 30 years. (This report is also known as the Oughterson Commission study.) This is the low-ball estimate, evidently because it was based on a census of households in Hiroshima and therefore did not account for the deaths of soldiers and Korean forced laborers, who are generally numbered at 20,000.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Nope Hiroshima was not a hoax, if only questions like these could be automatically sent to the bin for being disrespectful to the thousands that died.

As for rules, people with inward beauty are kind warm understanding of the world and life in general, and are confident due to this, so free of hang ups so people all types warm to their aura.

The cooking scrambled eggs may reflect your usual task The peacock eating your scrambled eggs may just represent some attention taken away from others.<br>  <br>  In other words, you are seeking for attention from others; however, due to certain situation, you are being controlled or being left out in some way and that is why you had this dream vent out.|`|abc381813c165c2e05af1a5b03932dd2aa	some times these dream suggest or indicate something which is going in ur life or in the past or in coming future ,it is not as it looks in ur dream .................<br>  <br>  but don't take any stress as it is just a dream and be cool and enjoy ur life<br>  <br>  smile please.........:)
imziSPonaa	Answer truthfully.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Why are you asking for mature answers on YA?  Have you not figured out that the vast majority of posters here are pre-teens?|`|O9HLoDj9aa	Ah, who cares what you ask. If people can't deal, they can't deal. But I would answer truthfully, because even if she's upset at first, it's best to tell the truth and try to work it out. Then, hopefully your sex life will go back to normal.

How sad......|`|BTTFVbYYaa	because they want to be as well and they are not.|`|6GmtcZteaa	Because they want the same thing. Why should you be happy and not them right ? lOl- not in that way I meant it. I mean it's just pure strong envy of wanting a feeling I think they can't have. Or they are probably sad that you are happy WITHOUT them, perhaps they thought they were connected to you emotionally or were so on the same level and once you became happy but did not involve them they got mad. Or perhaps they are just really really really really evil people full of jealousy and hate and I wish they can smile with you rather than ency you. P.s do not mind these freaks. Just live your life and be happy.|`|NxO58UJ1aa	you're assuming things

It talks about how, when we have an instantaneous reaction to something we haven't even had time to consider logically, we are actually responding to knowledge our brain has that hasn't come to the surface.  That's what is happening to you most of the time when you get a feeling or know what someone is going to say.  But as a poster above said, you are not aware of all the times you make a prediction and nothing happens, only the ones that do.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	To be a true physic you have to be able to predict specific events, or give great detail in what you see.  Just to say "something is going to happen" is a little silly, as something is always going to happen.  Next time you experience your feelings, write them down to the last detail.  Then if that event does happen, see how close you were to the facts.  If its right on, then you can make some big money.|`|f2AWSb48aa	It's spelt psychic btw<br>  <br>  Stop kidding yourself, that **** doesnt exist, your probably just a generally intuitive/ smart person.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	you are highly sensitive and capable of intelligent thinking -<br>  that is all.|`|d0brzTt2aa	no. people only remember the things when they set up expectations and it comes true.

And guessing what someone says is not huge, to be honest.<br>  <br>  I don't believe you're PSYCHIC. Maybe observant.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	Well, I think you have a very good intuition.

Its a very annoying gift. You just have to take it and try and use it to your  benefit. I experience all those and as odd as it is, i think its just a gift. I can usually predict something before it happens. I dont say im psychic, but I for sure think we have a true talent for "knowing things". Its kinda weird because no matter what, I cant stop knowing things before they happen, but sometimes it prepares you. I will just be talking to a friend and tell him i have a very funny feeling that this person is guna do soething stupid. then that night, that friend calls me drunk and starts saying a lot of stupid stuff. Its very annoying but can be useful depending on how you look at it. But its not like i can catch everything thats guna happen, but i definately catch a lot.|`|uzoh5XvWaa	I think you just know things. I do that same thing to and I thought I was psychic so my mom took me to the doctor and she says I am not psychic I just get "feelings" and they turn out to happen. She says it is just lucky guesses. She also looked at my school records and it showed my I.Q. and it was very high so she says that I may just "know" things because I am so intelligent.  Intelligent people have better bindings with the things around them so they are more alert and know things! Like one time me and my sister are sitting on the couch playing cards and she says Kaitlyn what is coming on next on T.V. and I said "Sabrina The Teenage Witch" and what do you know it said right after I said that it said "Sabrina The Teenage Witch coming up next!" Then another time i dreamed i was going to break my fingers and then next week at a birthday party we went sating and I broke my pinkie and ring finger on my right hand! Your not psychic because that means I would be too and you aren't alone honey believe me!

Good advice, opinions, etc. are always helpful but when it comes down to it a person should base their decision on what is best for them & not on what others think or do.

3L4citcnaa	For the first dream, it seems quite simple. Jumping a curb is slightly dangerous, and immediately takes you in a different direction. Perhaps you have recently experienced, or fear experiencing a sudden shift in your life? Going over 90 feet likely enhances this feeling of being unable to control your motion, or the events happening around you in your life. Landing in a busy intersection would not only put you in harm's way, it would also cause confusion. Cars are going all different directions, and having just landed there, you don't know which way to go. It seems to me that either you feel you need direction in your life, or you fear a lack of control. <br>  <br>  For the second dream, mayhap of fear of having to cook, or a fear of food? That's a strange dream. <br>  <br>  The third is very interesting. I think you need to ponder WHY you were trying to escape this light. Think on this for a moment, if you would. A light illuminates that which is hidden. Could you or your friend have something you don't want others to know about? I don't know much about your friend, but a kitchen is often seen as the woman's domain. If the light was over his house and in his kitchen, could there be some problem among you, your friend, and his mother? Then, the fact that you hide yourself in your GARAGE, rather than your house also adds to my idea that you want to hide in the dark, perhaps hide something you fear is dirty. A garage is dark, and often dirty itself. Why not hide in the house. <br>  <br>  Ponder these things, and try to think of your reasoning in your dream. I find that when I try to think of the cause, or logic (as much as there can be logic in a dream) the meaning of the dream becomes much clearer.
hXSSCFZIaa	It's okay, you just don't like people invading your personal space.  Some people are more touchy-feely and like to hug people they may not even know that well.  Other people would only feel comfortable hugging a loved one.  Nothing wrong with not liking hugs--it's just personal preferance.  Some people don't even like handshakes because they are germophobic (like Howie Mandel for instance).  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should just tell people that you don't like being touched and that it's nothing personal against them.  That way they won't be offended and they will realize that you aren't trying to be rude.|`|b64a7fe3eb82afa0c009c9b2faee80b5aa	I'm guessing you have a fear of intimacy with those around you or you may have feelings of self-depreciation and you fear letting people get close in case they see your flaws. Alternatively you may just not like people maybe because of a superiority complex or possibly because of a compulsive obsession that they have "lergies". I'm sure there are lots of possible reasons but I don't think anyone is going to be able to psychoanalyse you on that scanty information. Maybe there isn't reason. Maybe someone in the world just has to hate hugs.|`|zHmZkMStaa	I'm guessing you have a deeply rooted fear of intimacy.  This virtually always stems from some unpleasant early childhood experience.

AA10895669	Lol! for many today, our Authoritarian government is actually replacing the traditional family unit we once new, and it's consider a good thing.<br>   I wonder if it's because of the swing to the loathing in this country of anything held to a higher discipline and an ultra feminist aversion to anyone with a set of balls having any authority? It certainly seems to me that we've given huge amounts of authority to a government with out any balls to do what things must be done. (and I'm talking about anyone in either political party that is out to please more than it is to lead) And I feel government pushing very hard to get into my house and my life far beyond anything ever perceived or known to be in the constitution. The logical conclusion is that yes, if we continue on this path, you will find a nanny from the government pinning your child's ears back and sending them to bed with your complacency.<br>  <br>  NO, This is Not condoning a male dominated house hold. All house holds should have balance power and balance love between parents, each doing the job they are best at. So don't spin / edit / miss use / or take out of context.<br>  <br>  This article and I and others here are say that we are allowing government to replace the family unit or at least replace on aspect of that family unit and this is not only wrong, it's corrupt, vulgar, and insulting. Let alone a breach of your rights.|`|BkleL3F4aa	gov husbandry and now gov parenting lol.<br>  <br>  Its absurd. The taxpayer paying for other peoples children to be disciplined!|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	If you are suggesting that parents use a firmer hand of discipline with their children, I fully support that idea.   But why does it have to be the father?  I know plenty of families in which the mother is the disciplinarian, and she is quite effective. <br>  <br>  So to address this part of your question:<br>  Is it fair to say that a lot of women find combining the role of disciplinarian and primary care giver difficult if not impossible?<br>  <br>  No, that is not a fair statement.<br>  <br>  As for governments, I don't want one in my home telling me how to discipline my children.  I will take responsibility for that, thank you.<br>  And if my child's behavior violates your rights or property, I would hope you'd come see me about it so I can take corrective action.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	Antisocial behaviour has more to do with poverty and social disadvantage and it is a media panic to say it is a new problem. It has existed since the inception of industrial societies. As juvinile delinquency etc. This means that it predates the feminist movement and will require a lot more than the return of a male lead family to fix it. This is why youth work exists so children have activities after school to do which are organised and liberating. So far "antisocial behaviour" and all draconian measure of government have been abject failures at getting children to behave, in my opinion they only increase the alienation and disenchantment of young disadvantaged children from society. Families in these areas arent all female run, in fact many of them are nuclear families, others are large families. What they need is benifits and assistance for raising their kids, community activities which are properly funded and job training for parent and child alike to activate these people out of poverty. Certainly there is an element of parent absentees in some cases because both might have to work to live or other reasons such as family and community breakdown. I suppose it is possible that you could force people in male lead families in these places but as you have pointed out his is a problem in it self and not a solution. More liberating and human rights respecting solutions would involve active engagement with the problems affecting these people and the young people as well. Its not their fault they were born into poverty, why should they be punished for it.<br>  <br>  The government cant daddy people into being daddies..<br>  <br>  Keypoint. I didnt say it was all about poverty, I said it has more to do with poverty. There is indeed a link between crime and underprivileged areas. Granted family structure is an issue in these areas but this is more to do with rates of family breakdown suffered by these people. Poor families are still the most important cohort overall.<br>   Also my argument goes beyond "throwing" money at it. It has the substance of youth work and occupying peoples time as a way out of poverty. Much of the youth work and poverty prevention schemes are underfunded and indeed problematic given the underpaid jobs and lack of chilcare avaiblable available to people on these incomes. Youth work and programmes not just money do prevent crime and help young people get jobs there is often not enough resources available to these and they work against the grain of social inequality.<br>   You say that there is some sort of barrier to be remove to men coming home and leading these families? What is that? How are the men being prevented from flooding in now? There isnt anything blocking fathers from taking part in raising their childran. lone parent policies are reactive. That is they didnt come into effect until a problem was recognised. You fail to pin down how you are goin to alter the social structure so these men will merrily run back to their families. So the only method available to you is coercion. And some people ignore the costs of these methods and the difficulty in controlling people in such a way. Think for example the trouble that some lone parents have in getting maintanance by these so called happy to return fathers. So the government would have to become more authoritarian to deal with absentee parents. Also its lone parents in general not just women. Youth work is not coercive and lets children develop while respecting their rights your plan forces unwilling parents together. <br>  In history of social work giving ideological  precendence to the family has been a disaster for childrens rights. This has been reflected in my own country where the family has been enshrined in the consitution which meant that social workers had to focus in keeping structures togther. The case in England of Baby P is a good example of this too. Traditional families are great if they work in the idealistic way people think they will but a lot of the time they dont. Coercion is immoral and in this case very problematic. Poverty needs a practical and human rights based appraoch  not that of conservative ideologues.<br>  <br>  Hi, <br>  <br>  My general point is that family law tends to ignore the rights of the children and the oppurtunities of the child and can leave the child vulnerable. The primacy of married couples ignores abuses where they state should get involved. In the eyes. So if we take another case such as the baby anne case a child already bonded with her adoptive parents yet was returned to the other parents. I think that there is a need to.<br>   They are some interesting points but welfare states tend to favour married parents as well in terms of social housing the state enormously favours couples for social housing because they are all built with couples in mind. Couples are the first to allocated. Also lone parents find it hard to get a job because the state also targets it programmes toward unburden unmployed men without children or with a wife to care for them. So in many ways its good to live together as well! I don't think that people ever properly justify a return to conservatism. <br>   I come from Ireland and here we have had a very traditionalist state and know that a lot of the time its through authoritarianism that people are forced into certain roles. People in Ireland were heavily policed by the forces of the church and state. Dance halls were illegal, people were literally bet out of bushed by priests. People were banned from using contraceptives and women were actively barred from the workforce. This system needs coercion to survive. The oppressive role of priests, their curfews and control of irish sexuality shows that they are no different than what this conservative suggests and its not surprising that a conservative suggested that.<br>   Also like I pointed out earlier the lack of a critical view of traditionalist structures meant that priests were often guilty of(and could easily get away with) sexual abuse which has been reveal in a litany of cases in Ireland recently. My point here being that traditionalism doesnt just flood back in, its enforced. It is socially constructed and even legally enforced. In fact many of our traditionalist laws are inherited from common law and victorian english law. Tradition is authoritarian. This is why the movements against it are from below and not above because they, much like the 1930s english working class that created the welfare state were fighting against oppression.<br>   Its great that your family survived poverty and I don't subscribe to the idea of the infantile poor myself. I think that working class people should actively engage as partners in society and programmes for the welfare state should be designed to relink people into the free market when it disgaurds them. I would rather see programmes that helped  people find jobs and skills like that provided in youth work rather than simple means tested benifits etc. The conceptualisation of welfare as money is something that elitists in early industrial england and ireland did in designing poor houses etc. and is rather the liberatarian view of charity. Social policy should be designed for liberation not charity.<br>   I do agree that there is a problem with the welfare state harming replacement rates, actviation and stigma. I think that in general programmes should be training and activation based. I think that the people in poverty are often caught out by sectoral shifts and lack of labour market participation because of child care. I think that these people can get money contingent on retraining. This is the way it works in Denmark and it is much more human rights friendly and offers higher levels of equality. I think that cut offs without training are silly because they usually just push people onto other benifits and need to be backed up be training. I think the Flexicurity model is probably the best at the moment. This is rather than a polarised highly uneqaul nation like America. Where the social solidarity which held the nation together is in tatters. i think these anglosaxon states are the most stigmatising because of the means tested bases of their benifits and the quite elitist view that working class people who have to rely on these non-holistic procedures and when are forced of them into law wage economies if not to other benifits are somehow too lazy and dumb to be as successful as those who are lucky enough not to be born into or thrown into poverty by changes in the market economy.|`|9w9Q83tFaa	Yes I believe in Patriarchy but, words are easy to speak but harder to put into practice, when you get kids of ten intimidating adults and attacking adults with impunity you have aserious problem and, the conservatives are not going to be able to implement this law without a lot of civil strife on their hands.<br>  The trouble with Britain is that the governments listen to the voice of minorities and human rights groups who have their own agenda which isn't  in the interests of our country.<br>  The talk about crime linked with poverty is crap, crime is about the thrill of being above the law, it is about greed and power over the decent people who are prevented from fighting back by a government which promotes criminal behaviour by it's ineptitude to do the right thing for Britain and the British people.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Authoritarian government sucks. That kind of government is exactly the reason why America's founding fathers gave all you Americans the right to bear arms: so you could defend yourselves against such a government!! <br>  <br>  And yes, kids do need a bit of patriarchy. Women can be amazing mothers but we will never, ever be fathers, nor will we be able to replace fathers with other men. And kids need fathers just as much as they need moms!|`|wkjncmHTaa	What the article is talking about is hardly authoritarian. Patriarchy is.<br>  <br>  "Do you think we'll ever get back to the days when Dad's word was law in the home?"<br>  <br>  I thought you guys were for equality? And now you're saying you think husbands should have ultimate authority over their families?? Nice.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  <br>  If they're engaging in criminal behaviour then no, it's not.<br>  <br>  Uhuh, so mum's word doesn't count for anything??
AA12360662	First of all, seeing yourself in mirror or window is a symbol of assurance or confirmation seeking in reality. <br>  <br>  You are feeling the need to make sure everything you do is right.  As far as the kicker goes, that basically suggests that  you have low self confidence, seeing others is trying to harm you either by stabbings, strangling, shooting and so on.  That is a reflection of your helplessness.<br>  <br>  You are feeling low in self confidence, and that is why you had yourself projected as seeing yourself in mirror or window.  <br>  <br>  Even though you are happy and content in life, those dreams point to some low self confidence in you.  <br>  <br>  Of course, too  much sci fi, horror movie will trigger this kind of dream as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s.  A happy person can be low in self confidence or low self esteem while an unhappy person can be high self confidence.
RpHewn8gaa	Just how hot is she?|`|KF8CHY2faa	"How does one limit the risk with someone they don't know?" Easy, don't hook up with random women who're drunk at a bar. You'll save yourself time, court cost, bail, and your freedom. <br>  <br>  How about go out to social gatherings, where you'll meet quality women, find one that has the same likes as yourself; get to know her (maybe even date her) so that the two of you have a mutual understanding of where you feel the relationship should go (Should you have casual sex, or should you be in a committed relationship). That way you'll have a steady partner that you know is not sleeping with other men, and that you can practice safe sex with. <br>  <br>  I've done my fair share of 'dirt' in my days, but I guess the older I became the more I understood the importance of knowing myself worth for starters, and understanding that HIV/AID's is a hell of a price to pay for a one night stand. I was recently informed about a guy that I once knew who's now HIV positive after hooking up with random women. Even though HIV is not full blown AIDs, it can escalate to that level. What makes matters even worse is the fact that he's hooked up with so many women that he has no idea who he got it from, much less who he's given it too. <br>  <br>  I personally think that having an incurable STD (Hep B, HIV/AID's, Herpes Simplex 2) is a lot scarier than having a 5% chance of false rape allegations. You can beat a false rape charge, but you can't cure the STD's mentioned.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	5% is way too high a risk. That's a 1 in 20 chance i.e. any guy who had slept with 20 women or more would be lucky not to be falsely accused.|`|CspMhUPoaa	No, even 0.01% would be too high for me.|`|kxcDDMw9aa	Never.|`|jk0rAkEjaa	No way...and I think that with any one night stand you have the risk.|`|r4cThgwdaa	Nope.

You mean I can't even have a decent one-night stand without the guy I'm with worrying if I am going to scream rape the next day?|`|A71Uu05Uaa	5% is pretty high.  I'd probably have a lawyer draw up some sort of sex consent form and video tape her signing it and saying out loud that she is of clear mind.  Along with the date and time.<br>  <br>  Also, wear a condom and dispose of it in a manner that she can't sneak and grab it to impregnate herself.  If she's willing to call false rape, she may want to get your for 18 years of child support, as well.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I don't believe in one night stands, personaly I'd rather not get HIV.<br>  <br>  I don't drink so that doesn't count for me.<br>  <br>  There is always a risk for everything.<br>  No I wouldn't only because I don't have one night stands.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|iHKJsyfTaa	I've never let it stop me ,, but then again ,false rape stats are not usually what i'm concentrating on .|`|iRKOJhYeaa	"Do her"? <br>  <br>  You make it sound like a punishment.
AA12360662	First of all, not sure how old you are.  If you are close that age, it may just relate to relationship issue.  However, i think you may be lot older than them.<br>  <br>  Second, not sure if you have sibling who is boy.  My guess is no. In that case, dreaming of young boys may mean there is something you want others to look up to.  Projecting young boys may mean some respect from men.|`|i3w1G65Baa	means you want to interact with them.|`|AmV8s7Vaaa	if you know the boys that means you want to see them and if you don''t then that means you are subconsciously young at heart
7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	Yes, my stepdad 9/11/97..and he was across the country. It's a long and complicated story (they all are)..but he shot himself. Looking back , I vaguely saw signs..well there were plenty of warning signs, but I didn't know much about depression and alcoholism at the time. <br>  Not knowing what frame of mind they are in, it's hard to advise what to say to them..but I personally am a matter of fact kind of person. I learned the hard way, you can't be subtle about this. It's very advisable (especially given distance) to get them talking to someone in a prevention group or something along those lines. The underlying issues will need to be dealt with ,too..and this can be very complicated ; especially if it involves depression. <br>  Generally speaking, I'd say talking to them openly is a very good start. I personally now will tell everyone I talk to how gut wrenching it is for family members they leave behind. I don't know if this is good or bad, but I think it's important for them to know exactly how much they will mind f*k everyone they leave behind. I have seriously dealt with this finally...and am still tearing up writing this. It's not something that goes away. I didn't even begin to deal with it until probably 5 or 6 years later. I'm pretty okay now,  and one day I may work on a prevention line. <br>  But now , the best advice I can give you is to consider the specifics (their age..are they minors or not..if depression, alcoholism or drug addiction are factors, if there are people geographically close that you can call in,etc) and talk to this person, showing you care, giving specific options (numbers they can call etc), and offering your support. <br>  <br>  Sometimes just listening can do wonders. But if there are other factors, you need to encourage them to seek out professionals.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and them. If you have any further questions, feel free to email me.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	well the best thing is to do allot of talking and listening to the person and make them understand how much hurt he would do to others if trying it|`|Dsp7yigEaa	Well I had a friend who said she had thought about it years ago but she hadn't done it.<br>  <br>  I did consider it though. Last summer I became very depressed (I had some family issues) and contemplated suicide. I had been planning to cut an artery. I even hid this huge butchers knife under my pillow. But I just couldn't bring myself to actually do it. I was afraid that it would be too painful. And I am so completely thankful now that I didn't do it after all because this year has actually been the best of my life and I have best friends now that help me get through everything. So if there is anyone who is thinking about it, like your friend, please tell them that things will get better and that suicide is NOT the answer to their problems.<br>  <br>  So just try to be there for them, let them know that they are not alone and that you care. That's all you can do really....|`|8nKyRiahaa	When you have someone close and dear to you, you actually never allowed him to even think about it. <br>  For if that is the relationship, the love and laughter that you share and the close communication rapport each enjoy would have surely taken the misery out of any problem. <br>  I have seen threatening suicidal people, failed suicides, actual suicides, and they all stem from depressed people who have no one to talk to, or are in no situation of receiving love & being loving. If only they had someone close and who really cared....|`|EepiLrmZaa	my older brother killed himself in 1992. <br>  I tried talking to him. I tried getting him in a hospital.<br>  he had his mind made up. people do it for all kinds of reasons. <br>   he was an ordained baptist minister. <br>  depression is a hard thing to beat without help. <br>  if it comes down to it. call the cops. they will get this person the help they need.  this was not an option for me.|`|AA10034051	Yes I have , my husband. He has since been diagnosed with severe depression and is on medication and has been on it for over 8 years now. He no longer has thoughts of suicide.Sounds like your friend needs mental help and medication and therapy|`|YpDvYy5qaa	To be honest there is not alot you can say, you just need to be there to support them, put your arm around them when they need it, wipe their tears when they cry, let them shout at whenthey are angry, it will be hard, very hard, but they will appreciate it and it will benefit them! If you have serious worries though you can speak to people, either a GP , counciller, social worker, school etc! <br>  <br>  There are plenty of people to help you help them! <br>  <br>  Be positive around them and it will rub off!! Make them realise what they have worth living for, arange picnics in the park or in scenic places, make them laugh at least once a day etc! Like i said it wont be easy but its worth a shot!<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out ! xxx|`|BLnXhWoTaa	it's been years since i've actually pondered on the best way to do it, but i have my moments when i think i wouldn't care if it ended.<br>  <br>  i try to think of the people who would be hurt by it, which is probably why i stopped planning it a long time ago.  now, i get reckless; more often with relationships by not holding my tongue [or keyboard].  last night, i was on answers telling a few /\sses exactly what i thought of them, not caring about losing my account.  today, i played chicken with some cars in the crosswalks [that's not as big a deal as it sounds, i'm a militant pedestrian who expects cars to yield, it's just that i wasn't really watching the drivers].<br>  <br>  let your friend know that it would hurt you deeply and that you would miss him or her.  some contact with friends last nite calmed me down after a pretty big meltdown that left me feeling useless and lonely, and my bedroom an utter mess.  it's often a feeling of isolation that leads to suicide, and that's exactly how i was feeling last nite and this morning.<br>  <br>  check in on your friend, even if you get a cold shoulder.  if he doesn't answer the phone, go knock on his door.  for me, i always check e-mail, so that may be a good way to let him know you're thinking about him.  [or her...]|`|YIAZmSW7aa	Yes, my ex-fiance talked about it constantly.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't know.  There's not really much you can say.  I have a few different thoughts on this.  In one way, who am I to be so selfish as to expect someone to continue living if they are in so much pain that they feel they would rather cease to exist?  On the other hand, sometimes the pain is temporary but so blinding that the suicide contemplator can't see the impermanence of it.  I don't think there's much you can do on your own.  The person needs professional help.|`|23YPEAqBaa	Almost every single day - and especially if the weather is bad.  I don't deal well with it - I take the kids and get the hell out.  I just let him know that he is loved and that I don't want my children to have to listen to that every day of their lives - this sounds so wrong, like I need to be doing something else, giving more, something - but I've tried, and now it is up to my brother to make the changes he needs to be happy.|`|ErA5y4E7aa	Yes i have, my best friend. he has the hugest heart and whenever he puts it out there girls tear it apart.<br>  <br>  i hate to watch him suffer and its hard to know what to say to him when he talks to me about it. i just make sure he knows how much i love him and how lost i would be without him.<br>  <br>  just try to make them feel good about themselves. and be there for them.<br>  not much more you can do.|`|YNMnVjltaa	My sister tried it about two years ago, by slitting her wrists.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Yes, my ex....and he did commit suicide 2 yrs ago.
XWPOUafmaa	I would agree.<br>  <br>  Bobby Fischer was the most eccentric in my opinion, and all he ever did was play chess. However, we must recognise that there are too many other variables to conclude that playing chess is the sole determinant factor that causes eccentricity in people.<br>  <br>  I have a hypothesis that the generalised trend is:<br>  <br>  As Intelligence Quota increases, Emotional and Social Intelligence decreases. (et vice versa)<br>  <br>  You can observe this generalisation in everyday people, such as the school yard where people of high Intelligence Quota interact in social situations, compared to people with high Social/Emotional Intelligence interact in social situations.<br>  <br>  Eccentric behaviour seems to be more prevalent in rigid specialised fields of thinking such as chess, and we must take in account that certain specialties develop different parts of the brain and habitually as well as physically encourage certain thinking process. <br>  <br>  For example, chess requires often rigid memorised book openings, thinking ahead and planning specifics counterattacks, and deep situational analysis, as mistakes often cost the game, especially at higher rated levels. <br>  <br>  When playing chess everyday at a serious competitive level, these patterns of thinking are reinforced into the subconscious, because thinking in a calculative way, which may not be helpful for social interaction, allows the player to win games.<br>  <br>  This then translates into other areas of life, including social, where seemingly irrational demands and behaviour may make sense to the chess player (Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky) who has thought along these lines for his whole life, but does not make sense to the layman.<br>  <br>  Another contributing factor is that frequent and skilled chess players, notably on the Internet Chess Club (ICC), are people who work in areas such as aeronautical engineers, and other highly difficult and intellectually demanding fields of work. Generally, these people have a lower social IQ stemming from the time that was needed to be invested in studying to become, say, an aeronautical engineer.<br>  <br>  What was your rating?|`|SGMDnLkyaa	Is the way people with limited social skills try to get involved in the society.

Or, you may feel that graduation is some sort of approval from others.  Going back again may somehow satisfy your need.<br>  <br>  But if you are still in school, graduating 2 times in dream may symbolize some desire in you.  You may be feeling impatience and projecting graduate 2 times may reflect some urge in you.

And the fact that you keep trying to fly but you don't actually succeed makes it seem like you feel as though you're not getting what you want out of your life. As far as the dudes and the girl pulling up and then driving off, it sounds like you might have lost close friends or a girl who you really cared about or maybe both and now you have possible trust issues.
XWPOUafmaa	Firstly, you need a background in science, studying chemistry, biology and physics in high school, and pass with extremely high grades, depending on the university, to enter a medicine course.<br>  <br>  In order to become a psychiatrist, you will need to undergo 4 years of medical school, then after passing final exams and interviews, you will undergo a supervised work internship as a junior resident at a general hospital (1 to 2 years).<br>  <br>  You then train on the job under a senior psychiatrist for 5 years, working and learning a vast range of skills that may contribute to a masters degree.<br>  <br>  In the field of psychology and psychiatry, experience is the desired factor, so becoming a director will require hardwork and time.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about this, take it step by step, instead of seeing the whole picture at once as it is quite overwhelming.|`|IDHxfPKIaa	Er.. Well, first you'd need to go to college, and major in biology or be a premed or something, and then you'd have to get into medical school. When you become an intern, you should work to become a psychiatrist, and then...work your way up the career ladder, I guess. Lots of work.|`|xif22nwoaa	You would have to go to medical school and get an MD.  During your internship and residency, you would specialize in psychiatry.  The psychiatry residency usually involves 4 years of training beyond medical school.  Then you would have to pass exams to be a board certified psychiatrist (you won't be a director without being board certified).<br>  <br>  Then you get a job and work your way up the ladder to administrative positions and an eventual directorship.  It's certainly not guaranteed that you would become a director though - so many factors play a role in that.

I do not love this new concept where 'strength' and 'independence' is misconstrued as mouthy, yobbish, selfish & sexist.<br>  <br>  <br>  People who promote lies about half the planet's population sure make me wonder why they're so intimidated by men that they have to resort to hateful bigotry & lying.|`|7LSonIoraa	that because feminist are men haters. if feminist is about equality why did they try to cut down a lot of male sport in high school/collage. why it is that most boys are made to feel ashamed of they gender/sex. The reason why i know that feminist are men haters because i did intense research don't get me wrong feminist was about equality up unto 1928. In 1960 feminist morph into a menhating movement the only good thing they did was raise awareness of rape and domestic violence that about it. you need to read lot of books base on law and history. In her groundbreaking book Christina Hoff Summers documents in painstaking detail how the media has become an echo chamber for distorted and false feminist "statistics" and how public policy has been shaped based on feminist distortions and lies.<br>  Im glad you ask this question because i post question that show evidenced that feminist are menhaters some coward feminist end up delateing my question.<br>  <br>  <br>  For example, a typical feminist will see no irony in arguing on one hand that women need ever greater protection from domestic violence, rape and sexual harassment (even if it means destroying the lives of innocent men) but on the other hand that women are just as good as men at fighting, construction, farming, police work, etc. <br>  <br>  In short, feminism is the politics of convenience. And if you don't think feminist leaders are misandrist, you are in denial. Here, in their own words, is how leading feminists see men:<br>  <br>  "All men are rapists and that's all they are." Marilyn French, Author; (later, advisor to Al Gore's Presidential Campaign.) <br>  <br>  "Men who are unjustly accused of rape can sometimes gain from the experience." Catherine Comin, Vassar College. Assistant Dean of Students. <br>  <br>  "I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them." Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor. <br>  <br>  "I believe that women have a capacity for understanding and compassion which man structurally does not have, does not have it because he cannot have it. He's just incapable of it." Former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. <br>  <br>  "If the classroom situation is very heteropatriarchal--a large beginning class of 50 to 60 students, say, with few feminist students--I am likely to define my task as largely one of recruitment...of persuading students that women are oppressed," said Professor Joyce Trebilcot of Washington University, as quoted in Who Stole Feminism: How Women Have Betrayed Women. <br>  <br>  "And if the professional rapist is to be separated from the average dominant heterosexual (male), it may be mainly a quantitative difference." Susan Griffin, Rape: The All-American Crime. <br>  <br>  "(Rape) is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear". <br>  Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will p.6. <br>  <br>  "We are taught, encouraged, moulded by and lulled into accepting a range of false notions about the family. As a source of some of our most profound experiences, it continues to be such an integral part of our emotional lives that it appears beyond criticism. Yet hiding from the truth of family life leaves women and children vulnerable." Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women. <br>  <br>  "All sex, even consensual sex between a married couple, is an act of violence perpetrated against a woman." Catherine McKinnon (respected legal scholar; University of Michigan, & Yale; inventor of the "sexual harassment" paradigm) <br>  <br>  "The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness...can be trained to do most things." Jilly Cooper, SCUM (Society For Cutting Up Men.) <br>  <br>  "When a woman reaches orgasm with a man she is only collaborating with the patriarchal system, eroticizing her own oppression..." Sheila Jeffrys. <br>  <br>  "The traditional flowers of courtship are the traditional flowers of the grave, delivered to the victim before the kill. The cadaver is dressed up and made up and laid down and ritually violated and consecrated to an eternity of being used." Andrea Dworkin <br>  <br>  'To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he's a machine, a walking dildo." Scum Manifesto. (Valerie Solanas) <br>  <br>  "There are no boundaries between affectionate sex and slavery in (the male) world. Distinctions between pleasure and danger are academic; the dirty-laundrylist of 'sex acts'...includes rape, foot binding, fellatio, intercourse, auto eroticism, incest, anal intercourse, use and production of pornography, cunnilingus, sexual harassment, and murder." J. Levine; summarizing comment on the WAS document, (A southern Women's Writing Collective: Women Against Sex.) <br>  <br>  "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." Andrea Dworkin; from her book Ice and Fire . <br>  <br>  "I was, in reality, bred by my parents as my father's concubine... What we take for granted as the stability of family life may well depend on the sexua|`|MbjJzs7Caa	I don't agree with your second statement and I am a feminist.  I believe that men feel threatened by woman who are confident and know what they want out of life.

You need to examine your reasons to truly understand what your issue is with drinking.<br>  <br>  Second, the best definition of an alcoholic is one who has consequences to drinking and yet continues to drink. An example would be, your friends don't want to hang out with you, you are failing school etc. And yet you continue to drink.<br>  <br>  You're 16. Slow it down (or cut it out entirely) if you find that you cannot stop then you need to look into a program. <br>  <br>  Without more information I could not say if you are truly an alcoholic (based off of your info I would say no, but again it depends on the reasons you drank for 10 days and such) But regardless I do think that there are underlying issues. Most would not turn to yahoo and ask strangers if they thought you were an alcoholic unless the person believed it to an extent and wanted verification. <br>  <br>  I would say that there are more psychological issues underlying and that if they are not controlled you could be headed down a path of alcoholism. My biggest concern is that you are 16 an able to drink as much as you do without any parent awareness which makes me think that they are absent which could be your underlying problem. <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor. Check out AA or ALAnon and just see if it speaks to you. And tone down that drinking.|`|JmqbavUaaa	If you wake up and pour yourself a glass of vodka in the morning, you would definitely be categorized as an alcoholic. Social drinking is drinking on the weekends with people, at night...If you feel the need to drink more than that you're pretty much an alcoholic. I guess what you're looking for is how severe you are.<br>  <br>  I'd say if you continue on like this you could definitely develop into a full blown alcoholic, but right now you're just at the beginning stages of alcoholism. You should see what that crap does to your liver...you might want to think about cutting back and if you have trouble with cutting back then you're definitely addicted.|`|c1334d7d6d160918eed9551c6f52e61baa	I will ask you this can you go 10 days without drinking any alcohol? Do you find yourself looking forward to having a drink?<br>  I had a problem and I say this with kindness and concern,please,if you even THINK there might be some truth seek help. You are 16 years old and have 70+ yrs of life worth living.College to look forward to,traveling,love,so on and so forth. If you fall into alcoholism(and not seek help) there is the probability your chances experiencing those greatly lessens.I have lost a great deal to drugs and alcohol and have learned it the hard way.When I was 21 I had the same opportunity you had at 16 and made a joke of it.Trying to compromise.Make my own rules.My greatest regret from not learning sooner was the fact I can not get back the lost time and have a "do over".The fact that I hurt countless people who believed in me.Because I wanted to cover up problems instead of dealing with them.|`|vOOdwjMzaa	Youre an alcoholic if drinking is affecting your daily life in a negative way. such as causing problems for you at work school sports, or with friends and family. but in my opinion if you wake up and the first thing you do is pour vodka then i would say you might have a problem and try and slow down before it overcomes you and you become addicted. at 16 i dont think you should be drinking that much if at all.|`|85dd3e1a2e5f17251258499b9309d5a4aa	I dont like the term alcoholic, because peopel say its a disease which I believe is a bunch of BS.<br>  <br>  I had a bad drinking problem a long time ago and I quit cold turkey for a few years and now I can drink responsibly. <br>  <br>  If you ever feel like you NEED a drink to get through something then you have a dependency issue.

So when a baby meets a new person, the baby will often look to see how mom or dad is reacting toward that person, and will react in a similar way.<br>  <br>  This can be used to teach infants and young children how to react to everyday events.  For example, when a child stumbles and falls, if a parent reacts in frightened and concerned manner, then the child will learn to always be frightened and concerned when they trip and fall.  If the parent reacts in a very nonchalant way (assuming the child isn't hurt), then the child will learn that falling down is no big deal.|`|i3w1G65Baa	psychologists say that if you let your children hang out at alot of social events they will be alot more successful.

Good luck.  :)|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	Sounds like he has issues with neediness... typically associated with lack of self confidence... he's trying to assure himself that he's a good person by looking for verification from you. He buys dinner so you'll thank him and think he's a good guy... he kisses you because if you reciprocate and/or not dissaprove that's verifying that you accept him and like who he is... it's actually quite common in both sexes. The need to feel accepted stems from lack of self confidence and he's just trying to convince himself that he is indeed accepted by you. You need to express that you indeed like him, but if he continues the clingyness he'll drive you away. Make sure that he knows that you like him, that he's a great guy and you want to continue dating him... reassure him verbally so he does not feel the need to do it physically. It's something he will eventually  grow out of as he learns to accept himself for who he is. Now, with this knowledge comes great responsibility. Because of his poor self image he's vulnerable and easily manipulated... do not take advantage of this for you can cause deep seeded issues that can result in drastic actions on his part... I.E. suicide, stalking, etc... Be forthcoming, and work with him if you truly care for him, otherwise, if you are not able to handle it, break it off.

AA11124473	I think that being motivated and working towards your goals right now is wonderful! If I were in your situation, I'd think about those long-term goals, write down what you want to accomplish and when, then think about what you can do right now to forward those goals. (It can be helpful to ask specialists, school counselors, or other knowledgeable people as you do this.) If you have goals that conflict with one another, do some further research or try exploring them, so that you can make smart choices about which to pursue (for example, I was interested in veterinary medicine and in anthropology and in philosophy...to help narrow things down, I found a local vet who let me watch him work for 3 months and I started exploring anthropology and philosophy books).<br>  <br>  If you really want to, you can achieve many things at a young age, and in my view there's no reason to put off trying. I thought about my goals and put them into action when I was younger, and I was able to graduate from Berkeley when I was 19, visit lots of countries I was curious about, and do other things that have enriched my life a great deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your goals!|`|mjlb5JWEaa	its always good to know what u want to do. but our opinions change over school years.

I am 18, a Freshman in college.  While I have chosen my major as teaching, I am still interested in many other professions and subjects.  I wish I had explored these options earlier in my life so I would be more adamant with my current major choice.  Now I am working and studying, and it would be tough to change my major.  <br>  <br>  My advice is to keep doing what your doing.  If something interests you, read about it and try to talk with people in that profession. Gather as much information as you can and I guarantee you that your future decisions will be that much easier.  The more information you have, the better.  Don't think of it as worrying, think of it as planning ahead.
9wUrbqT3aa	LOL... wow what an ignorant argument.. no offense.<br>  <br>  Ignorant cause slavery lasted for close 400 yrs not 200 yrs & blacks have not received an apology for slavery yet.. (Japan recieved an apology for concentration camps & the bomb) So the sympathy aspect is mute also.<br>  <br>  Jewish people always bring up the holocaust... But they phrase it as "..we have been persecuted more than any race".  When Mel Gibson made passion of the chirst, you heard holocaust stories everywhere.  People go to jail in Europe for sayin negative things about the Holocaust.<br>  <br>  The deeper question at hand.  Blacks have had it hard in the history of the nation, and have only really been givin an attempt at a fair shake for the past 60 yrs compared to 400 yrs of oppression.  I say 60 years, because Jim Crow Laws were in full effect in parts of the nations in 50's & not able to get equal education. (ex. Martin Luther King protest).<br>  <br>  They both was wrong... the black girl can not blame the white girl for the sins/wrong doing of her ancestors.  Some white people fought to end slavery (ex. John Brown).  The white friend can not down play the significance of the black struggle in the U.S.|`|v7XIFyHFaa	LOL  Anytime someone starts a conversation with "you people" there is bound to be drama.

Most black people say yall put us through hell, we have suffered!!! but it wasnt even them. like the black girl in your story. She didn't suffer, her parents didn't either! it was her ancestors that she knows nothing about!  Also, people talk about how there shouldn't be any racism and bulls*** here and there. But why should black people have a month!! Doesn't that belittle the rest of us!! There is no White history month, there is no Mexican history month , or any other race month that lives here in the US. So i dont think there is anything special about black history month.|`|giBfNMX6aa	Whew!  I would have left the table too - those kind of discussions are never resolved.  It just goes on and on.|`|PhS1xUw2aa	This is a great topic! I may be censored for my words as I have been before. I take no blame for what happened to the people who first came from regions of Africa! I wanted Hillary to be our first female President, as I wanted a women in that office before a Black person. But now that Obama is in, let's support him and hope he is better than that Bush character was?<br>  I agree with is said about the Jewish people, persecuted for to long in history. But what about the American Indians; their land taken away from them and they were put into what could be called concentration camps. There peoples were murdered and Buffalo that was life to them destroyed for their skins and horns. The Hawaiians where forced into selling their lands for a bottle of whiskey and their queen at the time, Queen Liliokalani was imprisoned in her Capital where she died of old age. She never got to come out from indoors! The Japanese who came to America - and Hawaii that was not yet America officially  until August 12, 1959, where put into camps and treated horrible. I am not Japanese, but my my Uncle was...Yes! It happened to him also. The Chinese and Japanese came to America (Hawaii to work in the sugar cane and pineapple fields) to get away from the imperialistic rulers of their countries! Every country and It's peoples have been persecuted from other dominating country's! In Africa, the first peoples to invade and enslave the Africans where not Americas, they were from England and Germany and other countrys first! It is a long way from America to Africa! Also, Africans from other states in Africa enslaved African people from other states than their own and sold them to the Europeans; without their assistance the enslavement of Africans could not have happened. But still, so many Black Americas put up so much noise about what happened, but they never mention that other African Countrys enslaved them first and sold them, from greed!<br>  On the other hand, yes! there are many lazy assed neggative Black Americans, but there are also many White lazy-assed Americans, and those of every decendency too!<br>  I was looking for directions yesterday in a Black area in Alabama and I noticed to men who where Black and rugged looking. As I pulled up in my second hand Lexus they looked at me throught my tinted windows. I got out and said, "Hey guys! Can you give me directions? And they where thrilled to assist me. We shook hands and somehow got into the topic of race...which is the wrong terminology but that will be another topic; and I said, "Wouldn't it be nice if we could all just call each other Americans instead of Black and White and African American, which alianeates Black America"? I said, no one calls me Italian, Polish, Irish and Portugese American. They where laughing and heartially agreeing with me that we should all just call each other Americans. And if President Obama does what he should do to unite us all that will happen; we well be a united America!<br>  Share this with your two associates and allow them a different perspective. As long as any American from any decendency is still crying and attempeting to get money from Government nothing will change. Everyone in America who is America must stop crying and become united! America is a land of people from every nation~|`|ewybA08Iaa	No one wins an argument.  I understand and accept that many of our national population experienced enforced suppression, and this population included native americans, foreign immigrants, like the Irish, Asians, Blacks, North European, Iberia, Mexico, females, Etc. etc. etc. I accept that 98% of the suppressors were white males, mostly of English heritage, but there were black, French, and Spanish slave owners, and or indentured servants in this nation. All males in this nation had voting rights decades before females were emancipated. Women could finally vote in 1917, and to many males in our nation are still considered property.  So, make several copies of this response, and when anyone starts venting their anger, hand them a copy.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	WOW there were a lot of Generalization and misquotes.<br>  <br>  I give you kudos for walking away and I suggest that your friends try to resolve this instead of having some unspoken hate for each other.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	and I bet someone said, "I'm not prejudiced (or racist) but..."<br>  If you have to declare that you are NOT...you most probably ARE!<br>  <br>  Race, politics, and religion...baaaaaaaaaaad topics of conversation.

It represents security in business, faithfulness, and contentment with life. It may also mean that you are either in harmony with or in conflict between ideas and decisions.To see twins fighting in your dream, represents a conflict between the opposites of your psyche. One twin signifies emergence of unconscious material and suppressed feelings, while the other twin represents the conscious mind.

AA12360662	The focus of the dream is how you handle it. <br>  <br>  The setting is your roommate whom made the fire in the kitchen by accident and she didn't know what to do.  The intelligent you wanted to put out the file but can't.  <br>  <br>  Calling your husband to tell him to come home basically reflects some helplessness in you.  The big fire may represent something that may seem like a big deal, but in fact the consequence may not seem as bad.  <br>  <br>  In your subconscious mind, you have fear about tiny little things that may become big. Projecting the small damage of the kitchen may result into some awareness in you, but this awareness also reflects how  you see things in general.    In that sense, you may be feeling stress or anxiety about every single detail of thing.  And things may get worse, and in it, you are in lack of support or trust (that is why you called your husband to come home) as well. That is why you had this dream vent out.

snFHHKAdaa	In terms of genetics there were two main clans in the upper paleolithic period, the Gravettians and the Cro-Magnons. They were both anatomical similar to modern humans but the two clans differed genetically with Gravettians being predominantly Y-chromosome Haplogroup I and the Cro-Magnons Haplogroup R. I am not certain if there were any phenotypic differences between the two and modern man.|`|pHbbLoXraa	Cro Magnons are Homo Sapiens and the ancestors of modern Europeans. Altough there has been some gradual evolution since there settlement of Europe Cro Magnon skeletons are pretty similar to those of modern Europeans.<br>  <br>  Most anthropologists seem to of droped the extra sapien in "homo sapien sapien" and "homo sapien neanderthalis" and gone back to calling them "homo sapien" and "homo neanderthalis".<br>  <br>  There is no evidence that Cro Magnons interbreed with Neanderthals in any significant way.<br>  <br>  Cromagnons entered europe from Turkey about 40 thousand years ago spreading across displacing Neanderthals. The last known remains of Neaderthals date to 28 thousand years ago in Gibralter.<br>  <br>  Neanderthals are decended from a species known as Homo Hielderbergensis which settled in Europe half a million years ago and evolved into Neanderthals.

Finally between 40,000 and 25,000 years, as the Fourth Glacial Age softened towards more temperate conditions, a different human type came upon the European scene, and it would seem, exterminated Homo Neanderthalensis.<br>   This new type of man probably developed in South Asia or Africa, or lands now submerged in the Mediterranean basins. These first true men , parallel with the Neanderthal cousin , arose out of some more apelike progenitor. They were already far above the Neanderthal level of achievement and intelligence when first they come into our ken, and they had already split into two or more very distinctive races.<br>  <br>   These newcomers followed the food and plants to which they were accustomed , these new human races in the same species as ourselves, and with all human races subsequent to them, under one common specific name of Homo sapiens. They had common brain-cases and hands. Their teeth and necks were anatomically as ours are.<br>   There are two distinct sorts of skeletal remains in this period, the first of these known as the Cro-Magnon race, and the second the Grimaldi race.<br>    The bones found of the Newer Palaeolithic men, these true men, were first found, and so it is that they are spoken of as Cro-Magnards.
AA12360662	Things or items in dreams don't always appear what they are.  In your case, arguing with your beloved boy friend in dreams may just mean of attention seeking.<br>  <br>  Yes, you may have a perfect relationship in reality and never argue.  However, subconsciously you may be feeling the perfection is too good to be true. Projecting arguing in dream just reflects the things you want to feel as others would do in reality.  In other words, besides attention seeking or more attention you want to get from your boy friend, you subconsciously want to know what is like to be disagreed each others sometimes.  Deep down, you feel the need to have some difference because some times you may think perfection is hard to believe.  And that is why you wanted to project this arguing things first to give you a preparation if one day it will happens.<br>  <br>  Basically, you are into three things. 1. Attention seeking. 2.

Perhaps he is just troubled and needed a friend to talk to. It was nice of you to be a friend to him while the other friends don't like him and keeps away.<br>  If you feel he is disturbing and is disturbed, maybe you can privately see a teacher about it and explain how you feel about this boy?<br>  Perhaps he is having family problems and not having all the love and stability within his family as some do. This does affect him negatively and thus make him look "wierd". How would you feel if your parents were splitting up too? I guess it would hurt abit right?<br>  <br>  He does need alot of emotional support and he needs some of that from ppl who are older and more mature. If his unloading of problems is too much for you to handle, pls see someone older to ask for help.<br>  <br>  Maybe also you felt alarmed he said your father looked like his father. You can also bring this up to the teacher or an adult when you decide to speak to one or maybe you can get further information from this boy by asking him what he meant by that statement which referred to your father?

You considered your friend's feelings and you didn't get feed into those guys drunken stupidity. Which I am sure, your friends appreciated that a lot. I am in my early 20's and I live in a college town. I went downtown with my best friend last month, and while we were walking from one bar to another to listen to her husband's band play. This group of young guys were walking towards us on the sidewalk. One of the guys was obviously more intoxicated than the others, and he proceeded to yell out "Woo-hoo, the Steelheads just won." Then he ran up to the woman walking alone in front of me and yelled out , “give me five.” So she awkwardly complied. Then he runs up to us, and says, “don't think you ladies aren't getting one.” He runs up beside me and proceeds to slap my rear-end. I was in shock, my friend looks at me and says, “I can't believe you didn't kick his *$$ for that“. I just told her, “I'm still in shock.” I just laughed it off, and now it's like an inside joke when we go out. However, the situation could've really escalated into something frightening, and it does all the time, all over the world.  In my town,  6TH and Main St. is the ultimate college hot spot.  On any given Friday or Saturday night, you can watch approx. 200 people get arrested per night. It’s actually become a pastime amongst many locals, to watch the drunks get arrested.
hXSSCFZIaa	Think of it this way: by just believing what people tell you, you are vindicating what they are saying.  What I mean by this is, if people tell you you aren't good enough for something, and you believe it, you are in essence telling them they are right.  Why not try to prove them wrong?  Won't it feel great if someone says "you could never graduate from college, you just aren't smart enough," then you do graduate?  Maybe even with honors?  <br>  <br>  Don't simply believe people when they tell you bad things about yourself.  Chances are they are saying these things because they are unhappy with their own lives and want to bring everyone around them down too.  <br>  <br>  Also, try surrounding yourself with positive, kind people, who will encourage you rather than bring you down and tell you you are "less than."  However, I think it's most important to believe in yourself regardless of what anyone else says or thinks.  This is your life, you are in control of your own destiny.  Do what you want to do without worrying about defeat or failure.  Failure will come sometimes, but you will be amazed at how much you can accomplish if you really set your mind to it.  Good luck, and stay positive! :)|`|0MUwB3Czaa	Good friends help. If anyone treats you like crap they are not your friends.  Of course you need to believe you are not all those negative things you been told.  I don't have a master solution that will help you but if you are serious about building your self esteem research activities, books,etc on the subject.  There is many, many schools of thought on how to improve your self esteem no one works for all.  Just keep at it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://yourmetamorphosis.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://yourmetamorphosis.blogspot.com/</a>|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	i know a lot of people are just going to tell you to stop caring about what everyone else says, but its not that easy. you just have to look at yourself in the mirror and point out all of the great qualities you have got, and if someone tells you otherwise, you just remember, that as long as you dont feel that way, it doesnt matter what they have to say|`|BNhLWBEqaa	Believe in yourself ! Is the most important thing, those negative feed backs were a sign that you have to make a little more job, than you do<br>  The Respect is earned, not bought|`|ewybA08Iaa	Change your residence if you still live with your parents.   Why are you picked on.  Do you believe improving your grooming habits, including dental health, using deodorant, bathing, your choice of how you combine the clothes you wear, your shoes, If you need one, get a good hair cut.  Ya know, TV supplies many examples and products.  Take classes at a local school, go to the library, get a job.  I don't care if it does seem menial.  It will give you a feeling of pride, and money in your pocket.  Go to humorous movies.  Read, Be positive and look at the sunny side of life.  Listen to birds sing, enjoy the sunshine, grow some flowers or tomatoes.  Change your peers.  Enjoy a burger and a coke with a person you like.  Let us know if any of this sound interesting.|`|eXSy6IwMaa	dont worry about those people. let them be the one to worry you. ;)<br>  <br>  stand up and be proud of yourself. if you fall, thats fine, just still stand up after falling down and prove to them that you have something that they dont have coz, only you and yourself only has that certain thing.<br>  <br>  if someone will tell you some negative things about you, then just smile and tell him/her back what he/she just told you. and ask him if how does it feel?.. <br>  <br>  just be proud of yourself and never let them make you feel down ;)|`|XDaHrw4paa	A few things have helped me. <br>  <br>  1. Screw people and what they think. Honestly weather you good or bad they will still talk about you. <br>  <br>  2. Always believe in your self your goal and your dreams. There not dumb or stupid, don't let any ones negative criticism get to because deep down there probably hurting more then you. <br>  <br>  3. This one is important and crucial and that is become more disciplined. As in if you promise your self you will make time for something important then go out of your way to get it done!!! (Critical)|`|gVMmdeLcaa	say positive things to urself when ur lookin in the mirror or jus walkin dwn the street. Like... 'i look nice today' or 'i'm so clever' Then u'll realise its true! Be patient with it, it wont work over night but it will work. The bonus is that when ppl see u have more confidence, they'll like u more, cos the real fabulous YOU will come out.|`|koaVQVnJaa	Stop caring about what other people think of you. Live your life they way you want to live it and do what makes you happy.|`|aihogb26aa	It's all good and well to hear "believe in yourself!" or "stop caring about others", but in reality, if you have been thinking or feeling negative for years, simple platitudes won't change that. You should seriously consider going to see a counselor or therapist to really put in work to process these feelings. You can change a negative way of thinking about things, but it takes a lot of awareness and practice and a counselor could really help you with that. There are some simple things you could do, like write a letter to yourself or even just list  all of your accomplishments, how you've helped others, the things you do like about yourself, the compliments you've received, etc. But if you have felt like this for years, really working with a professional to change these ingrained thinking patterns is probably your best bet.|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	yes i do..i used to have a pretty low self esteem since i was really skinny and girls i was interested in never really payed any attention to me.  I started to go to the gym and started seeing results and that booted my self esteem tremendously.  I wasnt even big i just felt more confidence in myself and people noticed.  I think that going to the gym and workin out will make u feel better about ur self and people will definately start to notice u more
sVDpZjiKaa	no, this isn't a big deal...you will however, why mature men wear seakers with suits...get the insoles or supports and you'll be impressed with how much better you'll feel.  Your back will hurt less.  I got the inserts off of tv for like 19.95|`|DbuDaEqnaa	You can get special insoles that slip into your shoes and are shaped to raise up the inside of your foot so it will give you support for your feet and all the way up your ankle, calves etc. That should help if you are doing exercise.<br>  If you type in 'flat foot insole' into google, you will loads of website and pictures of them so you know what you are looking for :)

Force yourself to.<br>  Putting yourself in situations that you normally try to avoid (Not harmful situations, but social occurrences) will build up confidence.|`|0YQRbq9faa	There is no such thing as low self esteem.  <br>  <br>  You are a self-loather.  You are probably introverted and spend a lot of time in your own mind thinking and processing things going on in your life.  You are probably too introspective.  The side effect of being introspective is that you spend so much time inside yourself, that you see all of your flaws, fears and failings and they paralyze you socially.  You begin to think, wow, I am a horrible person with all these flaws and failures, who would want to be my friend or be around me.  Forget your flaws and failures and focus your energies on developing your strengths, gifts and talents.<br>  <br>  No one else can see those things.  You need to get your focus off of yourself and put it on others.  You need to be interested in them and the interesting things about them.  You basically need to get your focus off of yourself and seek out the friendship and companionship of others and get over yourself and your introspection.  <br>  <br>  Confidence comes as you are able to relate to other people because you are focusing on them and not yourself and your flaws and failings- everybody has them.|`|e45NUJZ7aa	Look into doing Positive Affirmations through Positive Affirmations you will be affirming to yourself who you really are within and only focus on the good things that you like about yourself, the more we put our attention on something the bigger it always seems to get, so when you start to see the positive things in life you will begin to see even more positive things about yourself.|`|Uagt9M5caa	You can always practice, maybe in a mirror at first and/or with someone your comfortable around and then move on up.. Such as with a parent and a friend, then people you just know around.  And then maybe you'll feel more confident.<br>  <br>  Don't push yourself too far too fast though.
rM5Tofhwaa	eventually, yes.  Neurologists search for physical abnormalities in the brain while psychologists try to detect human behavior based upon their actions.  The brain is not magic, so anything that happens that would not have been a physical routine, can be eventually detected.  so, although it will be a long time until this happens, neurology will be more effective than psychology.|`|VK4hUu23aa	Never. psychology is just as relevant as neurology.

wKbEKg0Paa	Thoughts are in our consciousness because we are aware of them. The subconscious is hidden within the recesses of the mind. What we do not wish to acknowledge consciously could be relegated to the unconscious. You can get in touch with the unconscious through dreams or hypnosis. When you're dreaming, the consciousness takes a nap that allows the unconscious to surface. Under hypnosis, you are awake but the unconsciousness surfaces because your guard is somewhat down.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	the conscious needs to talk to the subconscious. Think of the subconsious as someone who cant tell right from wrong.<br>  <br>  when your conscious says things like  "i'm no good" you subconscious makes no judgement about what its being told, it just accepts it- therefore it is vital to use positive conscious thoughts to keep your subconscious believing good things too|`|cTvP6j7Haa	"I talk to the trees...." that's why they took me away.

I wouldn't be surprised if it happens, but I'm not really in any group here, so no one's asked me to report "the other side"... LOL<br>  <br>  There was once a poster who had a list of people he/she didn't like on their profile page, with a message asking others to report them. Not sure whether they're still around. And I've read questions and answers stating that most of the anti-feminists here are the same person on different accounts.<br>  <br>  I guess some people are just really paranoid (them, not you :D)!|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I got one but it was almost 2 years ago.  I think it's utterly ridiculous.  Personally, the only way I would report a question would be if the question was directly insulting me in some way, (even then, it depends on what the insult is), or if it was saying something personal about someone (someone's address or phone number, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Other than that, there's really nothing on YA worth reporting.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I have conspired with people to report members who attack specific users. That's about it.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I haven't heard anything; it sounds so petty, you know.|`|WkLJI40baa	You mean there is a sockpuppet list?|`|nhZb43pIaa	No, no one has ever said a thing to me.|`|7LSonIoraa	no is not my style to snitch someone up|`|uhchod38aa	I have not heard any of that and to be honest, you seem a little paranoid. I would assume that there are men with multiple accounts, but I'm pretty sure there are women with multiple accounts as well.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm thinking of a specific user right now (no names but it's not you) who seems to be convinced there is a massive GWS conspiracy against them. This person writes very offensive questions almost every day. So a lot of people report these questions, not because they decided to as a group, but because the questions either violated the CG and/or just made many people mad. But it's just easier for this person to believe there is a massive conspiracy against them than to ask themselves, "maybe it's me."|`|QQQ36jMOaa	I was once, about a year ago, and concerning the member Jon...some number...I forgot his entire screen name.  He's no longer on GWS but yeah, ONE member approached me and sent me links to his questions she found particularly offensive.  I don't report, though, unless the matter is illegal (pedophile crap or bodily harm threats) or making light of rape and/or child abuse.  Other than that I let everything else fly.|`|gKCJLyIbaa	Would that have anything to do with the amount of question that have been deleted on this particular forum ?<br>  <br>  It does appear to be well censured and controlled and quite a few of my questions were deleted without explanation..<br>  <br>  A bit sad really since those question were not offensive to anyone accept maybe by feminists and their inane followers commonly known as fembots....<br>  <br>  Endlessly complaining to ensure non-censorship of their doctrine, dare anyone question their lies and exaggerations..|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I've never been privately asked to report someone but there was a poster who was always encouraging people to report Tracy.

I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with them, but so many people saying it so many times only makes it credible when I get my accounts deleted when it is common knowledge who I make fun of on this forum.<br>  <br>  Edit : I know at least 2 Feminists who use at least 2 accounts.

I ignore them. I've only had my email public for a couple of weeks, and the only reason I did was so I could talk to two specific users, so up until now nobody has been able to show me lists or share silly rumours with me.

hlkAosk2aa	Because, unlike good things, bad things have an added sense of being fun. Like doing something wrong, dangerous or forbidden heightens the adrenaline in your blood. And you feel like doing it more and more.<br>  <br>  Good things on the other hand, don't have this advantage. Whilst bad things become boring after a long time, it takes a good thing a very short while to be so. <br>  <br>  Plus we don't like it when people tell us what is right for us.<br>  <br>  Think about it.|`|AC0yjVJjaa	Not really sure what exactly your question is, but I'll take a stab at it.  Well, it is a horrible world.  Bad things are happening allot quicker then good things.  Killing happens every day.  It can be hard to enjoy life, but that is why we try to make the best of it.  This is not going to stop, you know, but you can not pay attention to the bad news media and listen to the good news.

AA12367392	Sounds like me theres always too much month left after the end of the money lol!  Seriously, you just have to come clean, you don't have to go on about it like nagging but just say that you are sick of running out of money and that you're trying to save, it might make you feel a bit embarrassed at first but just stick to your guns, besides, if they are your friends they'll come round to your place and bring something with them, I have done it before and my friends have turned up with a pizza and something to drink and when you get financial again you can return the favour.  Also beer is around 170 calouries for a pot 285ml and vodka is only 50 calouries, so if you feel like a drink buy yourself a bottle and use diet soft drink, that way you can have a few without all that weight gain and seeings that you have been looking after yourself cooking wise, you can save money by making extra when you cook by using fillers like more capsicum (bell peppers) onions garlic etc., and freeze half, I do that especially with spag bog, bacon spaghetti, macaroni cheese and and curries, then you have a ready made dinner to save on cooking and it also saves on money, you can do it mate, keep the faith - have you stopped smoking?  Hope so, goodluck! :)|`|m3UGI2BCaa	Well most friends just want to know you still think about them and want to spend time with them.

AA10988215	A lot of people believe in these things as a source of hope and guidance in life.  To some, it is almost like a religion-rather than needing proof they simply have faith in what they believe.<br>  <br>  The problem with such acts is that they do not tell of truths or inevitable occurences, but of purposefully foggy predictions which can be easily interpreted in a variety of ways and moulded onto life.  You can take 100 different people who believe and tell them all exactly the same thing and each one will believe it was a prediction just for them and no matter how different their lives are each will believe the prediction came true or is relevant to them.  Try googling the Barnum effect-it describes how many people are fooled by 'psychics'.  PT Barnum coined the famous phrase "there's a sucker born every minute".<br>  <br>  When I was at University I attended a lecture by an expert in parapsychology, whose lifes work had found absolutely no evidence of accuracy in any of these predictive acts like palmistry, tarots, astrology and psychics/mediums.  Many people were pretty pi**ed off by the lecture stating that it was faith, not proof that made these acts valuable so I guess in a way to some it is like a religion.  Whilst much of it is harmless fun to most, I think real problems exist where desperate people are exploited by fraudsters.  But each to their own and I guess many may find comfort in such things, even if the overall accuarcy is poor/vague.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|m89kGXBnaa	Yes, especially astrology. It's called the Barnum effect. Basically, generalised accounts of personality/motives etc are rated very highly by *any* person if they are given them told this is a "specific assesment" of them. Lots of the text used in the original experiment came from horoscopes/astrology works.<br>  <br>  There are other similar effects - self fulfilling prophecy and confirmationn bias being two of the best known. But the barnum effect is most relevant overall.<br>  <br>  As for validity, see other sources below.|`|0YQRbq9faa	"Self-fulfilled prophecy" is a psychological concept that means you believe something is going to happen, then you passively cause it to happen as you begin to think and live according to the thing you are anticipating whether positively anticipating or negatively dreading something.<br>  <br>  "Power of suggestion" is a psychological concept that means the word and suggestions of others upon you often motivate you and often manipulate you into acting, thinking, or living according to the content of the other person's suggestion to you.<br>  <br>  I think it is "self-fulfilled prophecy" and the "power of suggestion" that makes people go to them.  The psychic/palm reader/tarot reader/astrologer/fortune teller, they tell you that you are going to be rich and famous then you sorta pursue that life and are either successful or unsuccessful.  They tell you that you are going to be a loser - what do you do then?<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't believe in all that foolishness.  God is sovereignly and providentially in control of our destiny not some gypsy fortune teller at a flea-bit carny side show.  Palm readers should forget about telling the future and learn to read finger prints and help the police catch criminals - do something worthwhile with their lives.|`|wL2AnT6Waa	No , Astrology is purely fake , there is not even a shred of evidence to support it . <br>  <br>  Astrology was a primitive way of figuring out the "Why?"s and "How"s in the Universe by centering humans as the center of the Universe .plus it divides humanity based on no reason ( why should you let it dictate your life , i.e. hanging out with friends only when they are compatible horoscopes ? )|`|PuJ34kZnaa	all i have to say is EEEE ENNN EFFF PEEEE<br>  <br>  ENFP...check it out thats me!|`|9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	Para-psychology would be the place to start but no evidence has been found that these so called ways to tell the future are bona fide.<br>  <br>  It is just part of human nature to want to explain the world, to have order, to predict what will or is likely to happen... <br>  <br>  There is even a word for (just cannot mind) - how in the likes of palmistry or astrology general statements are deemed by individuals to have highly significant meaning to them - ala - if someone said 'you can be really outgoing but often doubt yourself and sometimes feel insecure'.  People might think yeah that is so me - BUT it is also pretty much everyone else too!  Some readings are even more vague than this 'someone will come into money soon' etc which could mean anything from winning a ￡1 on the lottery to getting a refund from the utility company etc - most people get money in from somewhere etc<br>  <br>  Cues can also be gleamed from people's body language - dejected = could say 'you have had a hard time recently' etc - as again most people do some times.. or whether wearing expensive clothes, a wedding ring - the list is endless..<br>  <br>  Plus it has also been shown that people place too much meaning on the right parts of a reading and disregard the  nonsense part..<br>  <br>  To me it is ALL rubbish - it is a way to make ￡￡￡ and nothing else.  The psychology of what makes people believe it or perpetuate it though would be very interesting indeed.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	A fortune telling system relies on two things:<br>  <br>  1. Ambiguous statements<br>  <br>  2. Suspended disbelief<br>  <br>  In order for the process to work, the person getting the reading must believe that it will because they will then actively look for events that could match the ambiguous statements or even contribute to the event's existence (a self-fulfilling prophecy).<br>  <br>  If seeing the future was possible, insurance would be obsolete.

YzoLa5Uuaa	Any one of those can be correct. <br>  <br>  A. If you are dedicated you can learn techniques to chuck massive amounts of information into highly synthesized memorable forms that fit in the 7 +/- 2 slots of working memory. <br>  <br>  B. Our brains are more focused on thinking in pictures rather than words, if you can suit your memory processes to using pictures you can remember things more fluidly.<br>  <br>  C. If you can improve your short-term memory you can hold more chunks, techniques for this are more complex but can happen.<br>  <br>  D. So-called Memory drugs can help, but I know less about this area.<br>  <br>  If I were to take a stab, it would be E, but it really depends on who is teaching the class, some may deny one part or another.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

6fvR8J9Kaa	your right, your not shy but your afraid of being rejected or the people you like may not like you back. you could also be afraid that you will be hurt by the relationship.<br>  remember, not every relationship goes wrong. sometimes we are just unfortunate that we have bad relationships or have been rejected.<br>  get this fear out of your mind and think of the positive sides of things.<br>  take risks cause you need to give yourself and others a chance.|`|AA10706568	Actually, I can emphasize with you to a point because I used to be afraid of relationships. For me, I was afraid because I would over-think the possible relationship and let all of my fears and anxieties convince me the relationship wouldn't work. By thinking that way, I was able to shelter myself at the price of getting to know a potential love interest. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is simple: LET IT ALL GO! Don't hang on to your fears if you feel as though they're inhibiting you. Just get to know people and let them know you because once you let go, the warmth and acceptance that could be yours will draw you in until you feel you really deserve it. Also, talk to your potential friends and boyfriends in order to let them know you're not rejecting them. If you tell them, they will more than likely try to reach out more towards you. Good luck!|`|7OtGCvcOaa	i feel like this all the time.

I know i'm not the only one who feels this way but sometimes you can't help but feel lonely.

These feelings crippled me for years and years, the vast majority of my life really. In the end I realised how exhausting and useless it is to feel like this. I also realised that you can't rely on others for your happiness - I hate to use such a rubbish cliche but so so true and you can only appreciate this when you have done it yourself.<br>  <br>   For me it came from the fact that I wanted someone to 'rescue' me in a way, to be my one and only (either friend or boyfriend it didn't matter -  just anyone) and to accept me 100% warts and all. Not only is this unrealistic but it's destructive: no-one will be 'everything' to you, you need different people in your life to fulfil different aspects or desires. I think you're putting people on a pedestal by thinking you should live up to their standards - what about them living up to yours? <br>  <br>  Any issue like fearing not being accepted always comes from somewhere, often childhood and usually (I've found) in people who are naturally shy or reflective; society tells us that to be accepted you have to be super beautiful/loud/crazy/creative/fun/rich etc so if you don't feel you're any of these things you might think you have nothing to offer which is - honestly - absolute bull. <br>  <br>  Now I'm grateful for how I was and now am, because I've got (not many) a few lovely genuine friends I can talk to about anything and I know they appreciate me for that too but it was only when I accepted myself for who I am that I began to relax around people - and thinking about it - they began to relax around me.<br>  <br>  This can all take time and maybe a lot of soul searching but you will get there, and in the meantime just try to relax around people and believe that you are worth being friends with and that people do appreciate and like you for who you are.

xif22nwoaa	The extent of damage of a teratogen depends on:<br>  <br>  1.  Timing - baby is most vulnerable between weeks 2-8, when all of the systems are forming<br>  2.  Dosage - the more teratogen a baby is exposed to, the more likely it is to cause damage<br>  3.  Genetics - some babies are genetically stronger and less vulnerable to the effects of a teratogen, just as some of us are genetically less vulnerable to illness and disease<br>  4.  Other negative factors - the presence of a teratogen, in addition to other negative factors during pregnancy (maternal stress, maternal age, other teratogens) is linked to greater risk of damage than if that teratogen is present in the absence of those other factors.

YzoLa5Uuaa	He has no right to touch you unless you want to be touched. In fact, I would consider this to be sexual assault. This is not a normal way to "get to know someone" but rather inappropriate behavior on his part. <br>  <br>  Consent (to be touched in any fashion whatsoever) can be given or taken away at any point you are with someone. You could be in the middle of the act or just getting to know someone. They do not  have the right to do so if you say no.

So you need to tell him, he might not be able to just tell necessarily (some girls tease, which can be confusing.

2GNFQPdmaa	Depression is a nebulous word, it's hard to say what is and isn't one, but let's look at some of the things that described the Great Depression in the USA:<br>  <br>  1) banks failed. We've been seeing some of this, but rescue money and mergers is preventing any runs on banks, and the FDIC insures depositors now, so we'll never see a bank collapse like the 30s again<br>  <br>  2) the stock market plummeted. We have seen this.<br>  <br>  3) unemployment reached staggering levels. We're still, as another post said, only at 8%. Employment is down but still very healthy<br>  <br>  4) there was a significant amount of deflation. We're not really seeing that at the same level.<br>  <br>  We've only hit 1 out of these 4 factors, so I'd be hesitant to throw around the D word just now.|`|kYVSmZy3aa	it been coming on for a long time...  when a person dose a job then<br>  is not payed. the economies bust some were...  at that point the math become eravlenit. like religion...|`|EMmGFqgJaa	Unemployment rate is high but only at around 8%.

Maybe you know he will win in quite an obvious way and that it will hurt at first but hopefully the pain will go soon.<br>  <br>  one of my friends however has always said you dream what you see in the day. Imagine you hate bananas and during the day you see one, in your dream a banana might be taunting you.

2GNFQPdmaa	US monetary policy is historically and still remains strongly anti-inflation. The US is nowhere near a position where it is willing to intentionally devalue its currency, and considering how dependent the US is on imports, a devaluation would damage consumers more than they already have been.
AC0yjVJjaa	Oh yeah, they can.  Your brain is very mysterious....  You don't need vision to picture stuff in your mind.  Actually, you don't really see things in your dreams.  It's kind of like video games.  The xbox 360 has good graphics.  Every thing is aligned great.  Brain works that way.<br>  <br>  Well, if they never experianced seeing things and were blind they entire life, then they will not know the proper form on how humans look like.

We are not born with innate visions to draw on with dreams. <br>  <br>  Blind people dream in sound, smell, touch and motion if they have never experienced sight. They dream as they experience the world, as we do. They do not sudden;y experience sight unless they have memories of vision. See souces below for supporting evidence.
sZeBrVLVaa	A product with elasticity of 1.2 has elastic demand. What this means is that for every 1% rise in the price, demand will fall by 1.2% (similarly, a 1% fall in the price will lead to a 1.2% rise in demand).<br>  The rule is:<br>  Elasticity > 1 : elastic (% change in demand is greater than % change in price e.g. luxury goods such as cars etc.)<br>  Elasticity < 1 : inelastic (% change in demand is less than % change in price e.g. essential goods such as food)<br>  Elasticity = 1 : unitary elastic (% change in demand is equal to the % change in price)<br>  <br>  Basically a firm producing an inelastic good can increase revenue by raising the price, as the fall in demand is more than offset by the increased revenue on the remaining demand.|`|cSQgz4Qhaa	Price elasticity of 1.2  is elastic... this basically means that if the producers alter the price the %change in quantity demanded will be greater than the %change in price.<br>  <br>  elastic is greater that 1<br>  unitary elastic is exactly equal to 1<br>  inelastic is less than 1|`|e0ca616f4bf7b7bdac0e0f4d4e777bb8aa	Price elasticity is a number that shows how responsive consumers are to a change in price.  When price elasticity = 1 demand is unitary.  When it is greater than 1 demand inelastic.  When it is less than 1 demand is inelastic. <br>  <br>  Example:  If you increase price by 10% and quantity demanded changes by 10% then your demand is unitary.  Think Total Revenue If TR does not change after a change in price then demand is unitary.<br>  <br>  If you change price 10% and the quantity demanded changes by more than 10% then demand is elastic,  If TR  increases after a decrease in price demand is elastic.  The opposite is also true.<br>  <br>  If you change price 10% and the quantity demanded changes by less than 10% then demand is inelastic.  If TR increases after an increase in price, demand is inelastic.  The opposite is also true.<br>  <br>  The equation looks like this     % change in Q / % change in P

She needs to hear it because she took advantage of you. You need to explain that you are sitting them, not raising them. Look to your church, there may be a circular with other services like Au Pair or day nanny.|`|ewybA08Iaa	Be honest with this manipulator.  Tell her you can watch her child but you charge a fee for your service.  Work it out as an hourly fee, and present it to her.|`|m89kGXBnaa	You can correct this without going off on her. Basically, she is taking advantage it seems, knowingly or not. And you are not, actually, being paid to be her friend or help. You are being paid for a specific service which is childminding at specific, pre-arranged times. You may well be lenient and flexiable, but only within reason, which does not include her cutting into your spare time.<br>  <br>  I would recommened asking her to come in at some point, sit her down, explain that you can not continue to offer her the reduced rate and ask now she is working full time she pays full amount. Also add that you cannot be available on no notice and that if she wants to drop her kids of, she has to tell her so far in advance.... basically, lay down the ground rules. You can also discuss with her what she needs from you, so this is a mutual thing (not you getting at her) and explain *why* things are or arn't possible (other kids demanding time, own time demands etc).<br>  <br>  Even if you decide that is not the way to go, coming up with a definate plan to change the situation will help you feel a lot less stressed and angry, as you will see a way out from your frustrations.|`|AA12205301	She is taking advantage. You need to get a backbone and let her know this is your business and you have certain business practices. You need to write up a contract, keeping in mind they way she is, and make it so she can't do these things to you. Also, you need to let her know that you need full price for both children.  It doesn't mattter if she goes to your church, is the pastors sons wife, or a friend, she has to follow your guidelines or go somewhere else. I had a daycare and many of my friends had children I watched, they followed my guidelines and never overstepped the boundaries. We remained friends through this.
b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	My friend does that a whole lot, and I've caught myself doing it too, the difference is some people do it much more often than others. I think that it's a way for an individual to feel like they have greater control over their life, because I noticed that my friend would tell the same story to different people we were hanging out with, but over time the story would change slightly. Like you mentioned he was starting to believe his own lie, every time that he told the story he was conditioning himself to remember things the way that he wanted to. I'm a psychology doctorate student, and memory interestingly works similarly, every time a person remembers something they are actually remembering the last time they remembered it. Memories aren't concrete, they are just interpretations so it makes sense that the more you tell people the lie the more you believe it. It doesn't matter if it isn't exactly the truth, you're already living it, and you're describing it to people so in doing so you end up believing yourself a little bit more every time. If you want to see an interesting movie about this, check out 'Memento.'<br>  <br>  The best  thing you could do is be more aware of yourself in the moment, ask yourself if you're telling a lie that is necessary or one that simply allows you to do what you want to. If you continue to lie to people unnecessarily it will affect you socially, it will likely lower your self-esteem or something of that nature because you're training your body to believe that the truth is adjustable.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	nobody is 100% honest, however, using lies to get what you want isnt a good plan. eventually someone is going to get hurt. either physically or emotionally|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You need to tell your Mom about this, so she can get you some counseling.

You yes, might have a lying issue but youre on top of the world compared to most because YOU RECOGNIZE and ADMIT it. You've overcome the hardest stage to recovery that there is. Good for you. =) <br>  <br>  As for how to solve it, you need to start playing the mental games with yourself.  You need to over ride the thoughts and put them into action which of course, the goal is, not to lie.  <br>  <br>  Many people lie bc they feel they need to please someone, are afraid to tell the truth and to avoid confrontation they say what the other person wants to hear.  Perhaps this is your problem or perhaps its not. Regardless of the root, or what a doctor will say or what you might make yourself think will be along and painful "recovery" - it all comes down to you.  You making the decision and forcing yourself to tell the truth.  <br>  <br>  Set personal goals for yourself.  You're your biggest hero when it comes to personal and insider issues.  No one else.  Beleive in yourself to solve the problem and it will solve itself.  But it takes work!<br>  <br>  Also - to get things off to another leaping change, tell someone you trust about this. Having the support is always encouraging.  Maybe your mom for instance, ask for her help in fixing this personal issue. <br>  <br>  Good Luck Kiddo ;)|`|SdpWsTlQaa	That lie was microscopic.

These people fear change, fear what they see as 'outsiders', and fear their own lack of intelligence. They KNOW they have no brains to become more than they are. If the coloured people all leave England,as these people want,who will be next? Chinese? Japanese? Anyone with a foreign accent? The world is FULL of foreigners-we are ALL foreigners,to people from other countries. The only way to end that,is to go there,say Hello,and be friends. But there will always be the scared ones,in any country,who see that as being bad,because it means learning new things,and being part of the World,rather than part of a Country. Most English people aren't like your workmates. Keep smiling,and tell them you are happy the way things are-with all countries meeting to be friends.|`|ewybA08Iaa	They are not nice people.  Please do not join them.|`|VkVp5zQvaa	do not join them. you have a mind of your own- do you what you think is right for you, and what you conscience can withhold. its obvious you think their prejudice is unacceptable as you feel upset by there actual discrimination. i think is an arrestable offence, but if they use it against black people then let them be stupid with themselves as they can definitely be arrested. i know it must be hard for you being new; but try get through it with dignity and dont fall into the victim of peer pressure. their racial attitudes might not disappear but will decrease within time because as you said you are one of the few whites within the workplace which is why they are so eager to recruit you. but if their behaviour becomes unbearable you should tell a superior (anonomously if you are struck with fear). good luck. x

If the demand is price inelastic it means that consumers would cut back their demand very little to a large increase in price.  If there was a poor harvest growers would raise prices and the revenues would increase. <br>  <br>  Unitary elastic demand:  increase P, Total Revenue does not change       <br>                                      decrease P, T R does not change<br>  <br>  Elastic demand:  increase P, TR will decrease<br>                           decrease P, TR will increase<br>  <br>  Inelastic demand:  increase P, TR will increase<br>                             decrease P, TR will decrease|`|YcQImRAraa	it means if there was poor harvest of oranges then they would have to sell them at a higher cost, resulting in people buying less.<br>  <br>  inelastic is something people don't necessarilly neeeed so if the price goes way up, people stop buying it.<br>  <br>  elastic is something people need no matter what. example is prescription drugs, if the price goes up peoplestill buy just as much bc they need it
e0ca616f4bf7b7bdac0e0f4d4e777bb8aa	The product is more inelastic for the poor because they have fewer substitutes  for the product.  Where else can they go for medical services.  The wealthy have more substitutes for hospital care,  private clinics and private doctors.  Therefore their demand is less inelastic.
