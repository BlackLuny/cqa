20090226192837AA2X0KG	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Does anyone ever watch NBC, MSNBC, or CNBC anymore?	I can't take it anymore.      I was an NBC fan for years...what happened?  They all rolled over for Obama.....I would respect Today and Olberman but they are more like cheerleaders for the Obama Administration....they stack the most liberal people, then agree with them.  Do YOU feel these shows are also going down in flames?  That Olberman is the worst - a bully.      Is that the most out of control emotional dude ever?  Every night carping and complaining with some of the most childish statements about Bush and Republicans and throwing flower of praise on Obama.      I just turn over to Fox - the  affiliate for NBC also loses my 22 year loyalty.

The school provided dinner and music but also a cute fun night to spend with our dads were they took off work and came to a special event with us.

Surely it's not beyond the bounds of credibility when so many can verify what happened there, so why does anyone deny their history when it's so obvious from those who were there what went on.   A dear friend of mine - now dead - was taken from her home in Germany, along with her parents and sister, to one of these death camps and saw some terrible things among which both her parents were gassed.  She and her sister survived and were liberated and eventually came to England.  There are many more who could verify these camps and atrocities so why does anyone try to deny them?
20090226210948AArZVAJ	News & Events;Current Events	What was the world's reaction to September 11th?	Right now in my media class we are watching World Trade Center and it's very sad. I went home today watching the first half and I found that I couldn't stop thinking about it.      I was in fourth grade when it happened and I remember my dad calling from work and telling me to turn it to the news and get my mom. I did and saw two buildings smoking and I wasn't sure what was going on, My mom just stared shocked and quiet at the screen.      When I got to school my teacher gathered everyone in a circle and tried to explain what happened but the actual event never really sunk in. Today it started to fully sink in I think after 8 years when I'm now a junior.      In the movie it showed other people around the world crying and just looking astounded. I was wondering how the world reacted in general. Were people in Europe and Australia and Asia surprised and stricken with sorrow. I'm from America so I know what the reactions were around me...If you're from another country and you remember the event would you please tell me how you and the people around you reacted?      Thank you, it's much appreciated

East Asian-White-Black differences fit the theory that modern humans arose in Africa about 100,000 years ago and expanded northward. During prolonged winters there was evolutionary selection for higher IQ created by problems of raising children, gathering and storing food, gaining shelter, and making clothes.         mind you that Cranial capacity's of blacks are 1,267, whites 1,347 and Asians 1,364       Race differences in brain size are present at birth. By adulthood, East Asians average 1 cubic inch more cranial capacity than Whites who average 5 cubic inches more than Blacks.

Since Nobama got into the oval office, network television and radio programs are searching (without much success) to find reputable black people to speak about current events.

I've been told that there just aren't "that many" intelligent black people available.
20090226221207AALoVhN	News & Events;Current Events	Something to think about?	There was a man on TV the other day that came forth and said he believed he was the Octo-mom's kids father. But Octo-mom denied it saying that even though he did donate sperm it was never used. The man said well he knew how hard it was to take care of kids and he had 2 of his own already so he knew 14 must be a challange and he would help her as best as he could anyways. But in an earlier interview Octo-mom said she only used the other 6 embryo's because she couldn't imagine letting them just sit there or destroying life. So based on that logic wouldn't you think that means that the guy who came forward as saying he was the kids father's sperm is still out there and with that being said what's to stop her from waiting until things die down in the media after she's collected enough donations and going to a different doctor who maybe has forgotten about her and having the procedure done again with this man's sperm??? I mean if she was "OK"with having 6 given her situation and then 8 more (even though she claims she only wanted 1 more) what's to stop her from having more???
20090226213609AAof8e1	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Getting Published - is it easy to get your book or article published?	Do most authors have to deal with bureaucratic crap to get their writing out in the public?  Why don't more authors strictly go online and use their own blogs rather than have somebody determine your fate through a publishing company?      Found this on CareerCritique      "Hours/Week: 12   Education level: High School   Percent of time on travel: 0   Years of Experience: 7   Job Security (Rate 1 to 10): 6   Comments: I have been writing for seven years now. Most days I work as a mortician (creepy, I know) but whenever I have free time I have written magazine articles, novellas, short stories, and even some novels. All of the writing only represents less than half my income and I do not consider writing my "true" career.      Writing is extremely rewarding. If you are interested about how the realities of the pay:      The nature of the publishing business is structured so that you receive pay anywhere from 6 months to 1 year after acceptance of an article or book. In some cases it is split into 2 - 3 checks: one at signing and review, another on delivery and acceptance, and one after publication. In other words it can take a while from when paperwork is submitted to when the paycheck is recieved. You may want to consider having another dayjob during this phase. Once Royalties begin coming your way from past books, depending on how well your books have sold, you will start to see money. A steady, livable income usually will not happen until 5 years of dedicated effort.      For all young authors out there - writing can be very rewarding, but dont quit your day job just yet!"       http://www.careercritique.com/addcomment...
