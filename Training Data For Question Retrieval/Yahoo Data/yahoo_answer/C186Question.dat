20090304122827AAGCebl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What are some names that go good with Brooklyn and Scarlett?	I like the names Brooklyn and Scarlett, but people have said they don't go well together. So can you think of some name combinations with both Brooklyn and Scarlett as the first name (and middle names)?      Example:      (First names)   Brooklyn Ciara   Scarlett Sophia      (Middle names)      Madison Scarlett   Ava Brooklyn      I dunno those are just random ones, but you get the idea :)

20090304122958AA5Gyfr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm in a difficult situation about breaking the baby news...HELP?!?	Ok everyone, I have a serious problem. I am 20 weeks 1 day today. This is my first child and I have already told everyone except for one person....my DAD. Now, I know, some of you are probably in shock reading this. If you all knew my dad and the kind of person he is you would understand why.      My dad is a very stubborn, money-hungry man. He has NO debts and his credit score is PERFECT! I'm the complete opposite of him. Although my debts aren't outrageous, just $1000. He buys all his cars brand spanking new and puts them on his credit cards! He doesn't have many friends just because of the way he is.       I'm scared to death to tell him. I already know it's going to be over the phone so I can easily hang up...lol. It's mean, I know, but what else can I do?! He wants me to be like him when it comes to financial situations. not to mention he's a Catholic that goes to mass every week like he should. He will frown upon me not being married and pregnant. When he finds out I'm having a baby he will lecture me for days and ask me, "How in the hell you gonna afford a baby when you can't pay your damn debts?!" I'm 26 years old and I know I don't have to take this crap from him, but he is the one that is willing to co-sign for me to get a new car. I can't be driving the car I have now b/c it's a 2 door and not working all too great if you know what I mean. If he doesn't agree to do this, then I'm pretty much screwed with the whole car issue.      I really need some advice b/c I'm telling him this week! I have never been so scared to tell my parents anything. What should I say??

20090303172949AA8kU73	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Weight gain and where its gone......?	Hi there       I am 22 weeks pregnant 2 weeks before i found out i was pregnant i had lost just under 2 stone as was into a size 16 at my biggest so i got down to a size 12.      I am only 5ft so loosing or putting on any weight is very noticeable.... well since being pregnant i feel like the fat lump i was when i was at my biggest but i haven't changed clothes size i am still a size 12 jeans and tops(just need longer ones now) but like i said i feel a fat lump..... the weight gain always goes straight on to my face and it  has big time i know its not water as haven't swollen in my fingers or ankles or anything..... i noticed the first hing to get bigger on me was my bum and i would say even my thighs have got bigger :-( bit i am still the same size before being pregnant.      I must admit i am indulging in crap but only when i am hungry i don't just eat it for eating sake and i have meat veg and potatoes etc etc for my main dinner.      I don't want to go on to websites about what you should be eating as i am living at home with my parents till my hubby is back home from the army end of this month so i have to eat whatever is in the house my mum isn't the most healthy of people she don't buy crisps and chocolate but the veg and fruit selection in my house ain't great and i know these sites will say i have to be eating like a rabbit and not eating crap like i am.      I darent weight myself as i will be gutted to see what i have put on since loosing it.      Any advice any positive answers?      I hope this makes sense any advice? i

20090303173647AAoFxqr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I just don't get it!!!Could i be pregnant? I highly doubt it!!! if not..what the hell is wrong with me?help!?	i know i should go to the dr but i cant get a visit until friday but i need to have an idea of what they will tell me..Ok..   I'm ALWAYS sleepy(fatigue)..I pee about 30 minutes every hour..I have this black line(never noticed it before) running from the bottom of my belly button to my pubic area(which i just noticed)...my stomach is ALWAYS bloated..Sometimes(at night mainly) i feel sick to my stomach..I have excessive saliva sometimes...What could be wrong? also my urination isn't painful and there's nothing abnormal about it..it's just that it happens EVERY THIRTY MINUTES OR LESS!!!!and when it flows..it feels as though I REALLY have to go and flows as such.   also i REAALLY dont think im pregnant because if i was i would be 10 weeks and I can't get a positive hpt and when it was a possibility that i was 8 weeks i took a urine test at the doctor and that wasn't positive either...
20090303103054AAy88MW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question about taking off pull-ups at night?	I just asked a question about whether to take pull-ups off my (just turned) four year old son at night. I came to the conclusion that I would do a week trial and see how it goes.       How do I approach this? Lately when I have been feeling his pull-up in the morning before I wake him up it is dry about 70% of the time.       However, when I wake him up he instantly pees in his pull-up because his bladder is obviously full from the night. Recently I have tried to take him to the bathroom quickly and encourage him to try to hold his pee in the morning but he can't. He runs to the bathroom quickly but usually can't hold it in time and pees in his pull-up or on the floor as he tries to reach the toilet in time.       He doesn't drink anything before bed. How can I help him to not pee as soon as he wakes up? Otherwise he will just pee the bed/ floor every morning..
20090303110556AA0xfKa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Another question for step parents?	Do you feel that your partner appreciates your role as a step parent to their children? Does he/she ensure that the children are respectful towards you and follow your rules, or do they jump to their kid's defense if you so much as ask them to pick up their own socks?       What about his/her ex? Are they supportive of your relationship with their children, or do they only involve you in their child's life when they want you to babysit?       Thanks for your answers. I am very interested in other people's experiences as a step parent.

20090303195426AAvua6i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should second pregnancy be worse than first?	I am about 8 weeks pregnant with our second child and I feel AWFUL!  With my first I had an easy pregnancy for the most part.  Some morning sickness, some exhaustion in the early weeks but this time I just feel so yucky and my belly hurts, just achy not stabbing.  And I have no energy what so ever.  I have been taking my vitamins, of course.  So is it normal for the second to be worse?

My son(5 in July) and his Dad are very close and I don't know which would be harder on him? To not see him for 30 days, which is forever to a child, OR to see him in a setting like Jail? To see him through a glass window? We thought about telling him that Daddy's working with chemicals and it can give him a runny nose if the glass wasn't there. Me and his Dad aren't together but we both don't like lieng to him. I just think this might be an exception to the rule? I just don't know!!!

I've been having period cramping for over a week now but there's still no sign of any actual period. I had unprotected sex twice last month and I know you can get cramping during pregnancy but this is like exactly the same as period pain and is quite frequent. I have sore breasts too. I fell pregnant last March (sadly lost the baby at 12 weeks) I did get some cramping during that pregnancy but it was only very mild and only lasted 1 day. I'm going to take a test later on today but just wanted to know what people on here thought? Do you think I could be pregnant or just late?

20090304062147AAlDtVG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Helping relieve morning sickness by eating apples?	Ok, my husband is driving me crazy, first of all he is a massive nag and secondly he is a big fat know-it-all. lol, ranting. But I when I grew up and I had a rough tummy when I was sick, my Mother would cut me up some apple. She said that if my tummy was rough, to stay away from dairy, citrus fruits, bananas, and anything with a too overpowering a flavour. To stick with simple flavours, even go with bland foods. I have always had apple when I have been sick, preferably green apple as long as its not too sour, and I've never had a problem. I am currently pregnant and for the first two months all I could eat was apples and bread because I felt so sick.  In fact as soon as I ate one I immediately felt better, which I think is due to the natural sugar...ie energy boost, and that I believe its soft on your tum. But he nags me all the time saying apples are too hard a food for when your tummy is rough, where does he pull this stuff from, I think he makes it up as he go along!      lol, ranting. :)      So what did you ladies eat whilst you had bad bouts of morning sickness?  And do you agree with me about the apples?

( i desperately want a baby but my partner doesnt) i started a very strict diet 2 weeks ago so i have not been eating much at all and exercising like crazy & last night i had a dream that i was pregnant before i started the diet but i had just found out i had lost it because of the diet.. then on the 2nd of march i woke up to very heavy blood! so now i have my period even though it wasnt due for another two weeks! can someone please help me because i am so devasted & it would totally make sense if i was pregnant because for the past week it has felt like i need to urinate all the time! and please dont say go see your doctor because at the moment i cant afford it. i would just like to know what you all think is going on with me HELP!!! :(

20090304071604AAtdaDy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ladies, What was the most embarrassing thing that happened to you while being pregnant?	Mine happened on Christmas Eve, my whole family met at my grams to celebrate Christmas and my sisters birthday...       I had recieved a new pair of full belly coverage maternity pants from my fiance and wore them for the first time that night. So everything was going great, having a good time... talking about my pregnancy.      Half-way during the visit, I of course had to use the potty. As I was doing my business, I had looked down and noticed that there weren't any underwear in my pants... so confused I couldn't remember if I had by chance forgotten to put panties on... until I realized I NEVER PULLED THEM DOWN! So yeah, now I'm dealing with the fact that I am wearing pee-soaked panties and laughing uncontrolably...    I decided to take them off, wrap them in some toilet paper and throw them away...      After getting out of the bathroom, I of course had to tell my fiance, which he found it to be hysterical...   After a while my family started talking about something dealing with UNDERWEAR and of course my gram just had to say "let's hope everyone here is wearing some!" At that point me and my fiance just lost it! I had to of course proceed to tell them the story as I'm practically peeing my pants... and the funniest thing happened next, my gram offered me some of her underwear! hahahaha!         so thats my embarrassing story... whats yours?!?

20090304072157AAxjq51	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there any way to know how far along you are approximately?	I went off the pill in October and hadn't gotten my period since. I went to the doctor in January and she told me everything was fine. She said to just keep taking a pregnancy test once a month if I was not getting my period. So, the last one I took was mid-January. Then, the last couple of weeks I have been feeling nauseous a lot so I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive. Sweet! But, I have no way of knowing how far along I am since I have not been having my period. I am going for a doctor's appointment next week and am assuming she will be able to somewhat figure out how far along I am, but I was just curious if anyone has any ideas of how I would be able to know before then?

20090304103301AAdVCf9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	One creative disciplinary idea you use that works for your kids?	no, spanking, time-outs, or removal of privileges don't count as creative.      Example:  when we go out to a restaurant we pull out a napkin and start keeping tallies for everyone.  You get a tally when you say "please," "thank you," "excuse me," put your napkin in your lap, or otherwise exhibit good manners.  Technically you lose a tally if you exhibit bad manners like speaking too loudly or getting out of your seat or slurping or something, but I think the only person that's come up for is my toddler, since the other kids are very competitive about their totals and don't want to risk it.  The prize for the most tallies is ... the most tallies.  There's nothing more complicated about it than that, but it keeps everyone on their toes and you wouldn't believe how many "thank you so much for passing the butter" comments happen during a meal, lol.
20090304105647AAppe7m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My eight month old fell and I'm going down a total shame spiral?	OMG(osh), I feel so terrible I've cried off and on all day.  My son fell off my bed this morning and I was standing right there.  I still don't know how it was possible!  I guess I'm just looking for some reassuring comments and some comments from those who have been there.  He's apparently fine, no marks even and he's acting completely fine and its been almost six hours since it happened, I just can't get over this.  He has just recently gotten mobile.  I didn't even walk away, my leg was touching the bed (an obvious stupid attempt to keep him up there in case he got close to the edge), I just turned to grab the remote to turn the TV off and BAM.  It was the worst sound I've ever heard. I feel like a terrible mother.

20090304105648AAeKLiQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What is a good City, Town, State to raise a family?	Just wanted some opinions on a good City, Town, or state to raise a family.      also this place needs to be very dog friendly.      (Where we currently live we do not want to raise a family, we have the lowest test scores in the country....they would rather pave roads than put the much needed money toward education.   Its becoming rather unsafe and there are no jobs unless you are in law enforcement or a Medical career)      We think we know where we are moving but I just wanted some opinions and to see if my choice is on the list?
20090304103101AAydOYR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I have a question regarding mothers and children?  Planned vs Unplanned?	Sorry I know this IS LONG......I'm just looking for some possible outside insight.  You know      I have been confused for years regarding my mothers relationship with my sister and I.      Does it have something to do with the fact that I was unplanned and she was planned?      She likes babies so maybe she really liked us as babies but it seemed I noticed that she lost a lot of interest in my sister when she was no longer a little baby?      She has never been a touchy feely person but something just seems off.      I don't think its normal is it?      Here we go:      if you ask my mother.....I ruined her life. Its my fault she isn't where she wants to be and doing what she wants to do. So for her no she would have rather had a glamorous career.      But there are times she tells me that if it weren't for me she never would have gotten her life together....      So that is confusing.      Does she thank me or blame me?      She does look forward to having my sister out of the house though (i am already grown and gone) because then she can do what she "Really Wants to do with her life"      I know she wants to take a job where she can travel.  She doesn't like being at home.   She also wants to do missions with the churches medical team overseas.      I have been hearing my whole life about how she is going to do this and that when she no longer has to worry about my sister and I.   (What about my poor step father is she just going to leave him alone?)            (She got pregnant with me when she was 20 years old and unmarried, she enjoys being a mom to my sister more but that is because she is kind of living through her.....my sister dances and sings)         Its just confusing, I don't think this is a normal way for a parent to feel.  Is it?         (I know she has suffered from depression on and off and she has had some problems after her wreck so maybe she just feels she isn't living)      I'm just real concerned.....is this normal?  I don't think it is and is there anything I can do or do I just need to stay out of it?

20090304105159AAMokCL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Taking off pull-ups at night?	This is a really frustrating situation. My son has just turned four. Lately he has been mostly dry at night but as soon as I wake him up he pees in his pull-up. Recently I have been trying to make him hold on until he gets to the bathroom but he can't make it in time.       Last night I took off his pull-up for the 1st time. I stopped drinks 2 hours before bed, he went to potty before bed, and I woke him up to pee in the middle of the night.   But when I woke him up this morning and told him to run to the bathroom, he ran as quickly as he could but peed as he ran.       Do you see my problem? That he's dry all through the night but can't make it to the bathroom in the morning without peeing in time. I don't want to put a potty in his room as he's only just mastered peeing standing up in the last few months. Plus I find it a bit gross peeing in his room.       Any ideas?

She has said "ball" and "mom" a few times but that's about it.  She knows exactly what I am saying to her though, she will do things when asked, knows what things are, but she won't mimic anything we say... what can I do to help her and is this normal?  I took her to her 1 year check up a month ago and she hadn't said any words and the doctor said "Well, she'll catch up."  I felt like she was way behind!

20090304102838AAdYk9A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Another breastfeeding question?	I'm going to be expressing milk into bottles instead of giving him the breast, this is totally my choice and i know it's time consuming but i've made up my mind.      I thought colostrum was hard to express, but obviously i've heard it's not, so i'll be pumping the colostrum and feeding it to my baby after he's born and carrying on from that.       I thought you didn't have much colostrum in the first day or two, so how do you satisfy your babys hunger if it's still hungry and you've nothing coming out your breasts?      Also, when i go into the hospital, do i take my breast pump and my bottles in or do they provide those until you leave? I didn't think you'd be able to sterilise your equipment in there, so any experience on that?

20090304102652AAL53R9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	What are your feelings on this?	Someone in another question gave an answer that really got me thinking and I would like to know what your take on this is...      I know that there are not many people here for pre-birth matching.  I am with you on that.  Someone mentioned that one "positive" (if you can call it that) is that the adoptive parents at least get to meet the first mother and hear her side of the story, rather than just false info from the agencies.        So I ask...do you think it is at least better that the parents get a chance to meet one another rather than having to go on someone else's account of the events?      Mind you, I am speaking about a meeting only.  I am not talking about any money changing hands or any coercion taking place.  Just the first mother being able to tell her pertinent info and whatever else she would like to share with the adoptive parents.

I called to get it and found out he hadn't called at all.        He HAS to go to these appointments.  There's no getting around them.  He might have forgotten.  He's become a bit forgetful.  But at the same time our son has had strep twice and whenever the little guy gets to coughing he will call the pediatric center and speak to them about it.      I know it's two different things but my husband has to go.  He has to have the blood work and the occasional x-ray.  I'm rambling I know so I'll wind this up and ask if you would put your child's health over your own.

I am so thrilled to finally be able to see and hold my baby. But, at night especially, I feel like something is missing, my tummy seems empty and lifeless now. After I waited so long, and all of the uncomfortableness of being big, far along, and pregnant I can't believe I kind of miss him in my belly. I guess it just seems weird after feeling movement all that time, I am worried I will forget what he felt like in there.

I get super sick when I am pregnant and throw up from conception (overexageration) to delivery (gods honest truth). I hated being pregnant last time.  My whole body hurt everyday, I would get terrible stitches in my side, I was sick.  I truly could not wait to give birth.  Oddly I really do enjoy child birth.  Anyway, I love my newborn baby.  I adore her soo much and my husband has been home more, not working as much as before, so he has been a great help with the kids allowing me more time to spend with our baby.  For some CRAZY INSANE, unknown reason to me I keep thinking about having another baby.  Financially we would be fine and I don't worry about that but I just don't understand why after such terrible pregnancies, and with four kids under 5 yrs old why I would even flirt with the notion of having a fifth?  Any ideas?  Just so you know I am on BC now and am being responsible but I got babies on the brain!!

20090304103444AAolS8Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	??PLEASE ANSWER?? Posted 3rd time now....really need an opinion PLEASE??	OKay, I'll try to make this short. I have PCOS. Did three rounds of clomid and metformin over a year ago. Now, I made a doc appointment, had no period for 4 months....the other day it starts...the day I'm suppose to get a pap. I didnt get that done. Doc wants to wait. I tell her to lets go ahead and start Femara, since my cycle had just started, didnt wanna wait for another cycle to come around, especially didnt wanna use prometrium to get it to start either. I go home that night, and my period stops completely. Woke up yesterday CD2 and it started spotting now...not really enough, but I am suppose to start Femara today (cd3), but I really havent had a constant flow cycle, just that one day. I have my HCG injection scheduled for the 12th, which is CD 10 (cause femara suposedly makes you ovulate a little earlier)....so if I dont start taking femara today, it would be pointless to go for the trigger shot. But I also dont know whether to just go ahead and start the femara since I did bleed one day and have been spotting after...I dont know..Im just confused and frustrated, cause I feel like Ive tried so much, and I really dont wanna reschedule everything, take prometrium to get me flowing normally, then wait until that.....so What should I do? PS. took PT and negative (just to be sure before I start taking femara)
20090304110303AArsCdc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Can a doctors test be wrong?	Do equate tests get evap lines? I took the test and left it. I am pretty sure I looked at within the ten minutes. It is a +/- test and the positive line was very faint then a little later it showed pink but very very thin and only on the left side of where the positive sign would show up. I took the test two days ago and looked at it today after I had a negative urine test at the doctor. The negative line had faded to grayish and the full thick positive line was grayish to but the little pink line has stayed. Am I pregnant or is the negative urine test at the doctors correct? I do not want false hope I just want to know. I didn't really need to use the restroom at the doctors but made myself and I took another test as soon as I got home which came up negative but I downed a bottle of water on my way home. I am going to wait to see if my period comes I am only four days late but I just want my mind to relax about it. Any suggestions?

20090304103800AAf7TUx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Baby name suggestions please?	Hello, My name is Alma Rosa. I'm having a baby pretty soon. In fact, I'm already past my due date. However, I can't seem to find a name for the baby. I was told I will have a girl, but everyone keeps telling me its a boy, so I need to be prepared for both. I have a list of favorite baby names:   for girls, we have   Kaylah   Abigail   Crystal   Melanie   Alexa   Ruby   Daphne   Bryanna   Isabella   Jocelyn   Celeste   Andrea   Madeleine      For boys, we have   Damian   Dominic   Elijah   Jonah   Devin      The big problem we have is that most of the names we have are not Latin (Spanish). My family is mostly Hispanic. I was born and raised in California, so I don't have trouble pronouncing the names, but some of my relatives do. Yet, if I choose a completly Hispanic name, then I don't want my kid to have trouble at school with people mispronouncing her name. In my case, everyone always mispronounced my name (Alma) at school. What can I do? I could have this baby any minute now and this is stressing me out a lot. I have a five year old daughter (Evelyn Sofia Olivarez)   My relatives and kids at school have no problem pronouncing her name. It's sort of a American-Hispanic combo. I love it. Also, the fact that Evelyn is not that popular makes its neat. What do you suggest for this baby.       Boy: ______ ________ Olivarez   Girl:______ ________ Olivarez         Thank you so much.

20090227064920AAPIBCZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby rice for a 3 month old?	My daughter is 11 weeks old and still wakes every 3 hours at night and im exclusively breast feeding, my friend mentioned this might be because she isn't getting enough from me so gets hungrier more quickly. Im not planning on giving her anything without consulting my health visitor, but my friend did say that with her son he was the same, waking frequently at night for feeds and her midwife suggested that as she was exclusively breastfeeding it was okay to give him baby rice once a day to help him feel full longer. The rationale behind that was that because he is breast fed he wont overeat like formula fed babys can do and will only take what he needs. Anyone have any experience of this?

20090304114428AAeeKoP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Why do people put their children up for adoption?	I once know a women who had children (3 of them). I was about 9 or 10 at the time. But her children where adopted and she did not look after them, but she must have liked children to do the job that she did. She worked as a speech and language therapist with people aged 5-19. She also had no partner, but when I asked why she said I am not going to talk about that at the moment.  At the time it struck me as if something where not quite right and I asked if he was dead, and she said no hes still alive and said for me not to worry. I them changed the subject. I know her because she was a friend of my Mum and Dads and I even went round to her house because she would sometimes look after me if my Mum and Dad went out. She would even refuse to tell me the reason why her children where adopted, but she was a lovely person to be with. Does it seem odd to anyone else why she never answered those questions when I asked? I asked on many occasions.

20090304112616AAXyBZ4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	About dilating and effacing?	I know that no two pregnancies are the same and you can be dilated to a certain point for weeks with no change, but, I went to the doctor this morning and he said that I am 2 cm dilated and 50% effaced. I have been having cramps (mainly in my lower back) and a lot of pressure. Also, this morning when I went to the bathroom I had a glob of snotty discharge when I wiped. He told me what to look for and when to call, so my real question is just how long did it take you from this point? Just personal experience stories is what i'm guessing i'm asking for!! Thanks everyone in advance!

20090304112059AA8tXJO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you take your child someone like Chuck E. Cheese or somewhere outside?	To please those who think I'm down in the dumps I got up and walked around the yard for a bit.  I realized how nice a day it was outside and I got to thinking of going to take our daughter to the boat basin, which is now like a forty, fifty minute drive depending on traffic.      It's got the basin area where people swim and the river where people boat and fish.  A playground, baseball diamond, but her favorite thing was the walk.  It's like a long wooden walkway a half mile long.  And they have emu and goats and a donkey out there which we'd feed while we walked.  It ended over the water, where we'd feed the fish and turtles.  She loved that.      Truthfully we never did get to take her to Chuck E. Cheese or the Fun Station or anything like that.  It's got me curious.  Which would you do with your children, outside or inside?
20090304110452AADN4lB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Playpen and moral(lol) questions?	im wondering, how old is to old to use a playpen.  my dd was born at the start of fall so by the time we can sit in the yard by the pool(which is what i had in mind for its use) she will be almost a year.  is that to old?  obviously she wont be running around alone near the pool,im not dumb but now i feel kind of weird "caging" her in like that at that age.  2nd question...we have friends who will be having a baby about 9 months or so younger than ours which works out for things we wont be using/dont want to store.  my question is....for the pricier items is it rude to sell them to them?  like the swing was just over 100, maybe sell it for 50.  we plan on giving them the little things our dd wont be using like alot of clothes, tub, bottle sterilizer etc.  our basement isnt ideal for storing baby items like the infant car seat etc for our hopefully next baby.  so what do u think, is it rude to ask for money? im only wondering because we will need to replace things with more age appropriate items(bigger car seat, etc)also some of the items were gifts from MY MIL!!! does that change anything?!?!?!!?  i would talk to her first before i did it, i have no idea.  lastly, for the things we will be keeping, mainly clothing, whats the best way to store them for about a year or so if all goes well in the baby making dept, lol.please, thoughts and opinions.  thanks as always!

20090304113431AA0fMJG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How can I get my husband to stop feeding my toddler junk?!?	Whenever my 17 month old is with daddy, or he is watching her, he feeds her the worst stuff.  She will have cookies, chips, m&m's.  It's stuff he eats too so he gives it to her.  Basically he is just to lazy to make a nutritious snack for himself or her.  He thinks it's no big deal that she eats that way with him but I am more worried about cavities and her not wanting to eat healthy food anymore.  How can I get him to stop doing this and see the importance of feeding a child food that is good for them?      I understand the occasional cookie but cookies for breakfast..that's just plain lazy and wrong!

We started trying again and my AF is due on March 1st.  However, I took an HPT today just to see and I got a faint line (First Response)!!!  I then used Clearblue Easy ("pregnant or not pregnant") and it said "Not Pregnant".  From research on-line (www.peeonastick.com) it seems that First Response is much more sensitive to detecting hCG.  We really want this to be true, but I don't think that we can go through more heartache.        Anyone else here use First Response and got a BFP and another HPT gave a BFN???      I'd also like to add that I took the HPTs early this morning (6 am).  Once I arrived at work I went to the pharmacy and I picked up another First Response.  I got the same:  2 lines, one a bit faint.

My daughter and I got in an argument last night while walking to church then she cursed at me for the first time. So far I took away her favorite show that she looks so much forward every Friday night for a month. Is that enough? I was also not going to let her see her dad until after the punishment because he doesn't care even when I tell him. He says it's between me and my daughter. He will allow her to watch that same program because he likes it as well. Should I keep her one more weekend so she won't have the privilege since she is being punished?      Please tell me your thoughts. Please be honest and kind.
20090227070553AAuclUd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My 16 year old daughter is dating a 35 year old man.?	I know that he is a good man because he is a lawyer and makes a lot of money. I am, however, worried about what her father would think. He ran away before she was born and sends a postcard every couple of months. His mother, however, is very involved in Katy's life and I don't think she would think it was appropriate for her to date a man who is a lawyer. My mother in law was molested by a lawyer, so it might bring back haunting memories. I've given my daughter "the talk" and lots of condoms, so I know she will be safe if she had to make a decision. My question is: what would you if you were in my situation? thanks.   -Louisiana mom

SHE IS 10 YEARS OLD   my niece is so out of control, i think its to late to do anything about it..her step dad is very good to her, I actualy live with my sister and her family and I see how good he is to her, but she is SOOOO direspectful to him, he will ask her not to eat anything before dinner and she will tell him, "im not eating your slop you jerk, i will eat whatever I want"its stuff like that she does ALL the time, she runs the house, her step brother will be laying in bed at night and she will go into his room and beet the crap out of him for no reason., she also does the same to her sister she, will pull chuncks of her sisters hair out. she threw somthing at her step brothers head once and there was blood everywere. she told me she hates men and she wants her step dad out of her life, there is no punishing her, if she gets put in the corner she will run out of the house and down the street or lock herself in the bathroom, if she is having a bad day everyone in the house will as well.she threw water in her moms face, she kicks her mom, her step dad took her to the store for new shoes and because they didnt do what she wanted to do, she took off running all over wal mart, when they got back from the store her step dad was actualy crying..he even went out and got her a puppy to try and win her over, that didnt work...everyone is going to say nanny 911 but im telling you I dont think it will work I have NEVER in my life seen a child as bad as her. When her step dad would put her in the corner she would leave the corner and call my mom (her grandma) and my mom would tell her "NOT to listen to him, he has NO right to punish you, HE in not your father, if he yells at you, you yell at him back" my mom also HATES men.I would tell my mom stuff she does and she think my nices is doing nothing wrong...i love my niece SOOO much I just cant stand to see the way she acts anymore, what can I do to help??she also laughs in your face if you try to correct her..ITS BAD..

I hear all the time that you're supposed to "know" when your baby is moving inside of you, but I really, really can't tell :(      Ever since 16 weeks, I've felt bubbles in my tummy. Sometimes pokes, and I know that HAS to be the baby, but are the bubbles gas or is that my baby, also? Is there a difference in it's position or something to cause it to feel different? I've only had the bubbling feeling ONCE while having the urge to pass gas afterwards.      Also, if it is the baby (this is my first) is it normal for it to be so active at 19 weeks? It feels like this past week like everytime I sit still, lay down, or just stand in place, all I can feel is BUBBLES!      Is it normal for babies to move that much this early? Sorry, I realize this was a ton of questions lol but I AM a first time mom (:

I've made all different types of foods for him, pureed butternut squash, sweet potato, apples, even yogurt and cereal.  He will not open his mouth for any of it.  I've been making him laugh and when he opens his mouth I put the spoon in his mouth.  He doesn't spit it out, so I guess he doesn't hate the food.  I'm a little surprised, my first son loved to eat at that age...        Anyone else have a problem like this?  How did you get your little one to eat?  Does the fact that he doesn't open his mouth mean that he isn't ready for solids?  He has 5 teeth already.  Any tips are greatly appreciated.

This weekend we have a big birthday bash coming up for one of our friends and I told him even though I want to go, I want to try to get out of going because I'm not going to be drinking and I don't want anyone to catch on that I might be pregnant.      Now I know this is mostly in my head when I think everyone is going to look at me without a drink in my hand and think automatically that I am pregnant, but I know some people will know somthing is up because a few of my girlfriends are already on to me and they were drilling me a few weeks ago about why I didn't have a drink at dinner. I could just tell them that I might be pregnant but I really don't want anyone to know just for the reason that if I am not pregnant I don't want to go back and tell them I'm not. I just feel like it is such a personal thing that is just between my husband and I. I don't want to lie about it and it's getting to the point where I am stressing so I would rather just take myself out of that situation all together and not go. By next week I will hopefully know for sure and then I won't have to worry about this anymore.      Here is the problem, my husband doesn't exactly feel the same way. He isn't going around telling everyone we are trying to have a baby, but he doesn't see anything wrong with telling people I might be pregnant if they ask why I'm not drinking. When I try to tell him how I feel he gets really angry. It got to the point where we got in a fight and he told me I am crazy and I should be on medication for this. He told me I am being completely irrational and I am basically trying to ruin his life - those were his exact words. He feels like I worry about stuff way too much and apparently this has put him over the top. Then he told me that he thinks that I am not mentally mature enough to have a baby and he wants me to go back on the pill.       I am crushed right now. I feel like he is the one being irrational. And since no one knows what is going on I have no one to go to. I'm sorry this is so long but I just feel horrible right now.

20090304120131AAL7Vxe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	For those who don't, why don't you spank?	Well first of all, I don't have any kids, Im a young college student...      ...but I have a bunch of little cousins who are toddlers and school age. 2 of them are bad as hell, and its because their mom lets them get away with any and every little thing. Im mean, its not up to me to judge, but Im curious as to why some parents think that talking to a child and telling them to "stop, don't do that" is more effective than a few swats to the bottom. I mean, I know some parents are into alternative methods of discipline, and they may or may not be effective. But why don't you not spank your kids when you KNOW deep down inside that they need some type of firm discipline. Why? (and by spankings, i DON'T mean abusive beatings. Some of you take things the wrong way...seriously.)
20090304123505AA2YxJX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you and your spouse have the same religious beliefs?	If not does it ever affect the way you raise your children and your relationship??      I am an Atheist and my hubby is a none denomination Christian,we do sometimes butt heads because of our difference in beliefs(ie he thinks something in the bible is a must do and I feel that it is not) but we usually agree to disagree.We normally don't talk about religion otherwise we would be debating all the time!! lol I do however feel that if my children want to learn religion and spirituality then they can so I'm not totally closed minded to it when it comes to learning it.

Okay, so I was picking up my little brother and one of my moms daycare kids from school.        While we were walking, there was about 4 kids (boys), all around the age of 13.  There were swearing in like every sentence.  *beep* this *beep* that.  I was about to say "Watch your Mouth".  But I didn't have the nerve to say it, cause theyre like all taller than me (lol).      I don't know if the kids heard it, but there was other little kids around.          What should I do next time?

I'm in 9th now and am one of the most flat-chested girls in school. There is no way I will ever have boobs unless I get these pills, but how do I tell my mother I want them?

20090304115731AAWWBb5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Have you ever had your periods come one week early?	I've been trying to conceive and I definitely feel that I am pregnant. But then I got my period one week early, and I thought I wasn't pregnant. Yet I've continued to get diarrhea, the breast tenderness, veins on breasts, the stomach aches, the headaches, the emotions, scary dreams, etc. here on after. So, I thought I would wait and see if I got my period again. Well, I did ONE WEEK EARLY again!      I've never been on the pill or anything and nothing has changed to make my period earlier. I never get hormonal when my period comes around or breast tenderness or anything. So why does it keep coming early? Am I pregnant? By the way it's not implantation bleeding, it's definitely a period. It lasts 5 days.

20090304130048AAA9soG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What's the worst that could happen?	I'm 13 weeks pregnant and in my 2nd trimester.   I know alcohol in moderation is okay for the baby. The other night I took 3 shots of Jack Daniels.   And they weren't full to the top shots.   I did get drunk though. But I took it easy and sat at my computer desk until I got tired enough to fall asleep.      Don't call me stupid, or a 'bad mother' please. I know what I did wasn't good, but it's never going to happen again.   I'm not a "wild child" or nothing. I don't do anything too bad.   I didn't think 3 shots of Jack Daniels would do anything to the baby.      I didn't have a miscarriage, and I've been to the doctor since I got drunk. I told my doctor and he said it probably won't effect the baby at all since it was in such moderation.   He just said not to do it that much and we'll both be fine.      My question is:   What's the worst that could happen to the baby?      Support your answer please.

20090304121342AApVDrb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I'm afraid of conflict between my daughter and my step daughter?	My husband is about to receive shared parenting with his ex for their 3 year old daughter. I love his daughter very much and I can't help but feel terrible for her because of the situation into which she was born. I won't go into too many details, but in short she never deserved this. Her mother was entirely too immature to have a child and she is putting unwarranted strain and stress on her daughter. I went through a huge custody battle too when I was 4 and my mother did the same thing her mother is doing. It really hurt me that my dad was kept away so much and it was purely for my mothers revenge. My husband and I are expecting another little girl in June and I'm afraid that I will not treat the girls equally. I love my daughter, but she will never be caught up in the drama that her sister is. I already feel a little more biased towards my step daughter to try to make up for what she has gone through. I want to give her a loving home like she deserves, but I don't want my own daughter to feel like I have a preference towards the step daughter. What is a happy medium here? I love them both the same, but I have this overwhelming feeling that it is my husband and I's responsibility to show his daughter the loving family she has never had and to make up for what she's gone through. What should I do?

I pay more than 75-90% of my cost of living ect.?   in arkansas you have to be 17 to get emancipated...      1. Am 17   2. Am a high school senior   3. Work 2 jobs (one is an internship for IT)    4. I pay for everything doc bills, gas for vehicle, cell, insurance ect. everything but rent-all i do is sleep, shower and laundry at my parents house.    5. Truck is in my name and paid off in full (becasue I was 16 at the time my father cosigned for insurance purposes..)   6. my parents already agree i pay for myself--   7. Rent would be like pick up the water bill and a few groceries from now till graduation does that seem fair? so far have no arguments about it so like $125 ish on rent give or take 25 bucks or so       .this could really help on the FASFA amount since when I move out straight after graduation i can fix up my grandparents basement help them since they cant find a decent nurse or aid, get job and to to tech school two days a week... college is on me so no help just grants ect hopefully can by pass the loans tho but will do if have to      8. I already do what i want to anyway...very few restrictions mostly becasue I work all the time anyway so its not like we wont be in too much of an inagreement and they will let me stay there utill graduation..which we all anticipate me to already be gone by then about a week before then anyway because I want out--horid living conditions but its the cheapest i got till grad    9. Have been told could get more financial aid since parents are not a factor in my college edu.    10.  I can legally fight our doctor for my papers since she's having a hard time giving them up!  Parents have already signed me over to the military..however becasue we were not allowed to have my med records i was denied...and have the same prob with the navy and this could really help me get into DEP or Officer whichever i decide to go into or even back to the air force...   11. again  parents already signed me over to military!

He has used it a few times (only to pee standing up )and the other day he said 'pee' and starting pullin his pants down and sat on the potty and peed all by himself. I am due to have another baby in about 4 weeks so im on maternity leave and have lots of time at home. Do you suggest being without a diaper or would that make it take longer? I just dont want to start and stop because it might confuse him. We watch Elmos potty time dvd once in a while because he loves Elmo. Any advice is appreciated :) If you think 21 months is too young, thats ok too. I just thought since he was showing interest it would be a good time to start.   Thanks

20090304120809AAReMEh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it true it is good to let baby have own time?	I just heard recently from a friend that you should put your baby in his crib about 30-45 mintutes a day, maybe even a few times a day to help them learn to be independant for themselves. It actually had a name for it like independant something, I cannot remember. But it teaches them to become more secure within themselves instead of becoming so clingy. I am just wondering who else has heard of this before and if anyone else does this. My son is very clingy and she said that it is something that they will have to get used to at first. Any thoughts on this?

20090304125207AAYmwPM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Why does my 7 yr old son think piercing my ears at 36 means I'm having a midlife crisis?	I went out for a night out with the girls from work. Before meeting up with them, I went to the toilet, and while washing my hands, noticed I had lost an earring - again!      I just thought to myself I'm sick of this shite, feckin clipons are only good for getting lost, and took a notion to go and get my ears pierced there and then.      My son reckons that for someone to do that on the spur of the moment at 36 must be a sign of a midlife crisis.

20090304131921AA2hOmn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I have NEVER flirted with any girl in high school nor has any girl attempted to flirt with me?	Of course guys are the one who are supposed to make the first move so I highly doubt there's any girls out there who tried flirting first (unless the guy and girl are already friends that's different)       With this is mind, How common is this?      I feel like a bit like a lone-wolf but I am picky on what girl I would want to be my girlfriend. No, I don't mean picky as in I have to get a hot looking girl there's plenty of those at my school but I often cannot find any girls who I can connect with personality-wise.      A connection in that arena is necessary for me, I refuse to join some clique in my school in order to get a girl, that's going against who I am and that's not me.       I have recently found this one girl and she seems to be the perfect match but I'm not sure if she's already taken. She's quiet like me and I feel like I must get to know her. Walking past the all the school buss's today I saw her...      I am so new to this... I don't know how I would find out if she was already taken and secondly I have 0 interest in REAL dating a girl, I Just want to have a school relationship...
20090304124001AAjU7sX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy or body off balance?	My boyfriend and I have been having unprotected sex using the “pull out method.” Starting after the sex from Valentines Day around Feb 15 I started having severe cramping so bad until I couldn’t move (I never cramp, not even on or around my period). The pain was sharp and achy on both sides of my ovaries. I had nausea throughout the day and my back had sharp pains in the lower area. My energy was constantly drained. I kept taking pregnancy tests which were negative. I let the cramping, fatigue, nausea and sharp back pains continue for nine days until I decided to see a doctor. I went and had a check up, pap, blood test (for HCG levels), and ultra sound done on Feb. 24.  My blood test was negative for pregnancy, pap was normal and ultra sound was normal (no cists on ovaries etc...). They couldn’t figure out why I was cramping so bad or give me a diagnosis as to what is causing these symptoms.       I continue to have these same symptoms but the cramping did get a little better after the appointment. On Sunday we decided it was okay not to “pull out” since my period was due Monday.   It’s now Wednesday and there is no sign of a period (which is not normal. My period is NEVER late). My cramping has become severe again and my energy is even lower. I am starting to actually throw up after meals and my breast ache. I took another pregnancy test Tuesday which came back negative.       I still have suspicions I am indeed pregnant but the doctors and test just didn’t detect it (could have been too early to test since sex is 1-2 days a week). My gut is telling me I am pregnant, and now with the period missing plus these unusual (pregnancy like) symptoms I am almost sure. Any suggestions as to what could be going on? Could my body just be out of order? How long would you wait until going back to the doctor? Does this sound like pregnancy or something else?

I have my first prenatal appointment next week, I think I am about 9 weeks pregnant.  My husband got arrested a few days after we found out and I think he is going to get A LOT of time because it is a parole violation, and the parole officer assigned to his case is a really mean person and I believe wants the conviction, whether or not it is deserved.  I don't know what to do, I love him so much and I feel like even if he isn't around for a very long time, I will always want a part of him, meaning the baby.. But at the same time, I know it wouldn't be fair to my child to not have a father around and I don't want to go through the pregnancy alone or be a single mother. I live alone and am very scared and torn on what to do.. Please help.

20090304130112AApVA6l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I had a miscarriage at 9 weeks what went wrong?	This was my first pregnancy, I keep wondering to myself what was wrong, everything was fine up until the day before my miscarriage.  I even had a doctors appt. about 4 days before it happened.  The baby was fine.  I had stress earlier in the pregnancy but none for the past few weeks.  What could have been the reason? I barely bled too.  I went to the ER for a little bit of bleeding they sent me home and told me to rest.  Than the next morning I started having really bad pains but barely any bleeding still it lasted for about 2 nd half hours.  All the way til I was back in the hospital.  But I had a miscarriage.  Why? Could rough sex cause a miscarriage? Any opinions?       I also had to have a D&C done, I am eager to start trying again. When should we start again?

I already have a 9 yr. old son with Asperger's Syndrome and he displayed signs around a year old. My concerns with my 6 month old are as follows : He throws severe tantrums(throws himself back,holds his breath,screams uncontrollably & pulls his hair);He screams at the slights noises & it takes along time to console him. He also hates most baby foods,screaming &gagging when I try to feed him. His arms & feet go in a constant circular motion and when he gets excited he already flaps his hands/arms. I hope I am not reading too much into his behaviors because of my older son but I am extremely concerned. Can anyone help in this matter or give any suggestions?

20090304131604AAYjk7d	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Increasing Milk Supply Through Medication?	Has anyone used medication to increase their milk supply?  What were the results and what is your opinion about it.  I have LITERALLY tried everything.  My doctor and lactation consultant (two of them) have recommended that I try medication because we have literally tried everything and at most I only transfer half an ounce a feeding... and that's the most I transfer (usually it is only .1).  I have tried everything from a medical grade pump, fenugreek, mother's milk, hand expression, putting my daughter to breast each hour, latching techniques, and various changing of positions when my daughter nurses.      My OB and lactation consultants thinks my last chance maybe medication.  However, I am worried since it is just a side effect of a medication and not really approved for increasing breast milk production.  However, I think at this point wondering is it is just safer to be satisfied with the minimal amount of breast milk she is getting while I've supplemented her with formula.  So please give me your thoughts and feedback.  Ultimately I would love to strickly nurse without having to supplement with formula anymore (I wish my breast would understand that!  LOL.)

I just saw the new McDonald's commercial about the big brother who is so nice to his baby brother and gets to go eat with his mom.  It made me cry.  My step-daughter is 4 and loves her baby brother to no end, and for that I feel so blessed.  Has anyone else teared up during this commercial?
20090304133348AAOzQwX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would a grand mother feel when her grand daughter is taken to Saudi Arabia by her father?	How would a grand mother feel when her grand daughter is taken to Saudi Arabia by her father, when her mother (your daughter died).  Since the father is the only surviving relative he has the legal right to take her back to his native country.  She does not want to go, but any judge will say she has to.  You may never see her again.
20090304134131AAYnod8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Would this be selfish? Why do people adopt from abroad?	A few days ago i saw a question on adoption which got me thinking. What reasons would a person adopt from oversea's, do you think it is maybe its due to the parents being harder to trace for the child and the parents feeling upset when the child decides to find their natural parents? Almost to secure the child as their own forever? I did see this point made in a question, its not me personally so don't worry! I believe adoption should benefit the child first and formost!

20090304135533AAPEwdp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I tell my parents?	Lately, my mom has been talking about my future.  My future career, my future school...  She keeps telling me what I "should" go into.  But the truth is, I don't want to be an accountant, and I don't want to work for the government.        Actually, I'd like to work in the film industry.  You know, work on movies.  As part of a team that creates a movie.  Maybe even work in a major film studio.  That would be a dream come true.      I know it's my future, not hers, but I just can't help thinking she'd be disappointed.  I was a straight "A" student, and my mom kept saying that I had "so much potential".        She just finished telling me I shouldn't go into the auto industry (duh), or become a realtor.        Another problem is that I'm Canadian.  I reside in Ontario and most major film studios are in the USA.  Is my dream unrealistic?        Parents, what do you think?  What would you tell your children?
20090304141231AAapThN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Periods normally go for 5 days but only lasting 2 days?	It's been 12 weeks since I last gave birth and my periods have been normal for the first 2 then my last one only went for 2 days with a few days of really light brown discharge, I had a bad pain in my tummy 2 days ago on the right side and was thinking it might of been my appendix playing up or a cyst, I don't know but this never happens to me cause my first 2 children I went right back to 5 days of having a period, 27day cycle and coming at 1pm on the dot. What could be wrong, I have to have a pap smear cause I will admit it has been 5yrs since the last. I couldn't be pregnant cause im still getting a period at least and using a condom. Could there be something wrong with me.

20090304133224AAEcb0N	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Update from Today's Ultrasound...?	So the doctor found out why I am spotting and had the issue on Friday with the few hours of bleeding! I have a blood clot in my uterus. He said it is nothing to be worried about and it cannot hurt the baby in any way. He said when the egg implants itself in the uterine wall, it burrows pretty deep which creates blood (implantation bleeding). With some women the blood actually comes out and with other women the blood just stays up there, has nowhere to go and creates a clot. I had a little bit of implantation bleeding but not a lot so the blood stayed inside of me and created this wonderful clot! haha Until my body completely flushes this clot away, I am going to experience this spotting...ugh! But I do feel much better that I know what it is now. He also said because my numbers had been so good for a while that he doesn't feel a need to keep taking blood and that we can take my blood again in a couple of weeks just to check.      Just some interesting information for my ladies!!! I was surprised to hear this so if this happens to anyone, have your doctor do an u/s to check for clots or cysts, don't panic.      How is everyone else doing??? Hope all is well!!!

20090227072404AAPaKGi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Furniture and Storage - What do I really need to buy?	I am starting to look at nursery furniture. I am seeing that most collections come with a crib, chest OR armoire and some sort of changing/dresser piece. The room we have for our nursery is a little small and the layout is awkward to fit all that furniture. One wall is taken up by a window and another is taken up by a closet that sticks out and is not flush with the rest of the wall. So really I only have two walls to work with without having to arrange furniture awkwardly. I want to know if I would be able to get by and have enough storage if I only buy the crib and the dresser/changer and not the chest so I have storage and a place to change the baby. I was considering putting some stacking storage units in the closet to help make up the difference. Also will this be enough storage when the baby is old enough to use the furniture in a toddler/child room? Thanks for any advice.
20090304134439AACfN3J	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you know if your child is a bully or if he is being bullied?	I noticed that my son is a leader, however sometimes it borders on annoying. Now that he is in school i've noticed that his teacher often refers to him as a bully but I just found out that the kids at school have been teasing him, is it possible that he is being bullied too?       Personally I don't think of him as a bully, he likes to tell the other children how to do different projects, he also likes to be in charge and have a "job" to do, I explained all of this to the teacher when he started there, she claims these are traits of a bully. (I'm not sure)       Recently my son has been getting angry and aggressive, he has a happy home life and he has never really been this way before. His teacher claims that he is physically hurting other children,  but at his preschool, and when he goes to extracurricular activities he is not this way at all.        According to my son no one in his class will play with him and the kids pick on him (when I spoke to the teacher she was completely aware of this)       could it be that my son is suddenly angry because he is being bullied? or do you think he is the bully?

If they haven't eaten in 5 hours (coming home from school) and I'm serving something simple like chicken and veggies..and I get whining..I tell them that they have 30 minutes or else they are going upstairs with no games or tv. Parents have this idea that they just put their food away, etc. My kids are scrawny...when I serve them, they will be respectful and show appreciation and eat it...as it nourishes their body. What about you?

It would be nice though, especially if you breastfeed. I could do it if it weren't for hubby in the bed.
20090304141119AAVif7k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	LOOOOONG one but need some opinions (may be TMI)?	Ok, I do not think I am pregnant, but a thought happened to occur to me and I need some thoughts on the situation......   Ok, so I have had a really odd month this month. Let me start by giving just a few key points: I am not on BC, do not use protection, and normally have regular cycles but they are occasionally 2 no more than 3 days late (that's rare). My periods are also very heavy and last for about 5 days and is heavy from the first day til the day before it is over.   Ok, now that you guys know those things here is the rest of the situation...I was suppossed to start my period on the 8th of February but did not get it until the 27th in between that time I took 6 HPTs which all came back negative. I think that my cycle was trying to reset itself, but anyway...about 2 weeks before the 27th I had a lot of cramping, discharge, sore BBs, and a few other symptoms (I am assuming it was a late ovulation) well, since my period was not here yet I decided that I would get as much BD in as possible (since the tests kept coming up negative) and I finally got my period on the 27th (this is where TMI is) It started (Kind of) when I got up in the morning but it was not really normal. It was a brownish color but it was mixed in with some kind of CM and was kind of stretchy(not sure if this would be the right word) then I didn't get anything else until that night. I finally had to put a pad on the next day but it was still pretty light. The third day it did pick up a little but still was not as heavy as usual and it was brown and red mixed together. The forth day it went really light and brown again (I thought it would be finished by yesterday). Then Yesterday it stopped except for when I wiped and then it was brown again most of the time but did have a slight pink tint once. When I went to bed last night I had nothing(no period), so figureing I wasn't pregnant I decided to start right away (I know most women do not conceive the day after their period but I wanted an early start lol) When I woke up this morning I had more brown blood again not a lot but just enough I decided to put a panty liner on to be safe.    So, I tell you all of this because a thought occured to me, if the cramping and other symptoms (which are gone now) I was having was ovulation and we BD around that time, do you think this bleeding was my period and just weird because of the lateness or was it implantation? I doubt that I am pregnant but want to see what some other people would think about it. (I'm not going to buy a test until I miss my next period but am getting oppinions anyway)
20090304142120AA77Iz7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I be worried about my weight at 12 weeks?	Well, I know every pregnancy is different, but should I be worried?       I saw on here that MOST ladies at 12 weeks either have gained VERY little weight or even lost weight...& average should be about 2-5 lbs in the first trimester.      I've gained about 9 lbs so far.. =(  I rarely had morning sickness so it wasn't a problem keeping down the food for me. I am 5'3 & weighed 126 before pregnancy.      Before I even found out I was pregnant I had lots of food cravings and ate like crazy! I stopped with all the cravings at about 8 weeks and the little morning sickness that I had.       I'm only exercising about once a week because I can't seem to keep my nausea away. Should I exercise more?       I also keep very hydrated so that shouldn't be a problem.      Also my OB never took down my weight pre-pregnancy; so i'm not even sure if she knows to inform me to be worried! Plus I don't see her until about another 4 weeks!      Now at 12 weeks I seem to be watching what I eat and how much, because I feel i've gained too much weight.       Should I be worried?

20090304140334AA319ub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My eight year old brother acts really disturbed... How can I help him?	My brother has a lot of angry outbursts, and he hits our mom when she upsets him. It doesn't take a whole lot of upset him either.   He's really into his computer games, and his counselor suggested a limit on them which seems to make him a lot angrier when it's time to get off. He has up to 2 hours of computer time.   Today my mom offered to take him to the park, but he was so busy on his computer game that he said no. Then after he got off he wanted to go, but he couldn't because it's too late. So he started crying and knocking things over and ran out the door and down the street crying and hollering.   I'm concerned about his safety and everyone else's. He's in counseling but it doesn't seem to be enough.   He also does poorly in school and does not know how to make friends, and all he ever shows any genuine interest in is video games.   I don't really know what is wrong with him. My mom has bipolar disorder, could this be affecting him as well?
20090227072330AAnTP4Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anybody had swelling in their hands while they're sleeping in mid-pregnancy?	I'm 19 weeks pregnant and worried.  My blood pressure was borderline at my 16 week appointment, but I've got a home blood pressure cuff and it's been normal since.  For the past week or so, every morning when I wake up, my wedding rings are tight.  The swelling goes down throughout the day and then comes back in the morning.  My hands also feel stiff.  At night, my ankles get a little bit swollen and that goes down when I put my feet up.  I'm so scared of possible pre-eclampsia.  Has anyone had this happen in a normal pregnancy?

20090304141204AAeb1gQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Getting Pregnant after depo?	Just recently I have gone off my depo. I was due for a shot last week. I had started reading all these horror stories of women miscarrying after the depo shot or taking them 2 or more years to get pregnant! I went on the depo 19 months ago after having my daughter. My doctor didn't tell me much about depo besides it was safe and I would get it every 3 months and being a new mom only having the worry about birth control every 3 months sounded great! I really wished she would have told me more...especially things like bone loss and the amount of time it would take to get it out of my system. How long after going off depo did it take you to get pregnant? Did you have any strange pregnancy symptoms while on depo or going off depo? When did you get your menstrual cycle back?

20090304141241AAVjAWI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why are women who are Moms (sometimes) so cruel to women who don't have children?	We were having a discussion about parks and bringing children into them..and this female colleague told me that she saw some weird stuff going on recently so she doesn't bring her children there anymore. I asked 'what kind of weird stuff' and she replied very dismissively 'oh, you wouldn't understand, you don't have children'. I replied, 'oh I would, I have nieces and nephews and I was a child myself once'. Another time, she said to me 'oh, many of my friends got pregnant on purpose when they reached 40 & hadn't met a guy'. I answered 'that never happened to me'. The fact is I've never married or had children, am a few years older than her and live a lovely life, contracting & travelling in between. I feel she is giving me mean digs. Why is she doing this to me? It seems so rude

20090304133704AAdNLzP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why has my 10 yr ols son started to tell so many lies?	I very recently found bruises on my sons legs and after alot of tears it appears they were from two boys in his class, who have been kicking and pushing him about in the playground and then hiding his PE kit,ripping up his reading folder,and name calling.I have spoken with his teacher adn also the head and they have said that they have now spoken with the two boys concerned and will keep an eye on my son.When I asked where his PE kit was tonight he said he didn't know,then he had put it in the wash,but after I told him that he would be grounded if he didn't tell the truth it turns out they have hid it and he cant find it.This is so out of character for him and I somehow need to get him to stop telling these lies to what it seems like he is protecting these boys.He has a school activity trip next week which I have paid for which is two days away from home,and the two boys concerned are attending,but I am unsure if I should allow him to go as I feel he also needs to be taught that lying is unacceptable.He is 10 years old.

20090304133751AAPYBdZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My son screams in his car seat?	I have a 6 month old premature baby who only weighs 10 pounds. Whenever we put him in his car seat cries the entire time he's in there. The belts aren't too tight, so nothing is hurting him. I think it's just the fact that it leans him back, which he hates. It's one of those combination car seat strollers with a car base that we use.       I was thinking of getting an upright convertible car seat that doesn't lean him back, but I wanted to get some imput on if that would even work or if there is anything else I can do before I go out and spend $150.      Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do?????

20090304134851AAHC96S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	3.5 Year old wants to be told she's pretty.?	According to my daughter's daycare provider, she has started asking to be told that she is pretty.  Didn't sound bad to me, she is pretty and I'm sure she's  used to hearing so. However, now if you don't affirm that she is indeed pretty she has meltdown.  I suspect this is a typical 3-year-old behavior, but I'm also concerned about her self-image.  I don't want her to think she's not pretty but on the flip side I don't want her thinking that being attractive is all that's needed to be a well-rounded person.  Any suggestions on how to handle this feedback loop?

My bf and I are no longer together and I will be a single mother. Once my daughter is born I am going to be going through the process of trying to get Sole Physical Custody and my ex will just have visitation. My ex has threatened me that if I chose not to do Joint Custody that he would fight me in the courts.   After almost 3 years with my ex I finally got enough courage to leave him. My ex was verbally and physically abusive to me before my pregnancy and part of my pregnancy when I was with him. He has threatened harm on my father and threatened to vandalize my car.  I believe he has some mental health issues. He has been dealing with depression on and off sense high school. I have caught him causing harm to himself "Self Mutilation, cutting of his forearm". He has threatened that he will commit suicide by shooting himself. He is a manipulator and a pathological liar.  I do not want child support from him and all around do not want him to be around our daughter and I. I live on my own in a 2 bed/2 bath home and am very financially and mentally stable. He moved back in with his mother & step father and is not employed. What are my chances of winning Sole Custody of our daughter and he would have supervised visitation until I fill he is safe.

People messed up my name growing up all the time, teachers used to call me Hoe-si-bella, but I found it bothered me more for someone to mess his name up. Some people even mistake for a girl because of how the pronounce his name. When I took him to get shots the nurse pronounced his name wrong and kept reffering to him as she even though he was dressed in clothes that were clearly boys clothes.  I corrected her but she kept doing it, evenafter his diaper was off!!! I was so annoyed.  So I was just wondering how many people go have hadsimilar experiences and how do you deal with it.

We waited for a little and I started to finger her, maybe that could be it but I don't know. Is it even possible for signs to be showing already? She took a home pregnancy test last night and said it came positive, and i'm really freaking out over this

I am 10 weeks pregnant and my blood type is B+.  Do I need to worry that there will be a problem with mine and the baby's Rh factors not being compatible?  Unfortunately, I have no idea what my husband's blood type is.  This is going to sound rude, but if you're not sure, please don't answer.  Thanks so much in advance.

20090304150014AAiG6rC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sex on birth control during inactive week, pre ejaculation only.?	Alright, really out there, but I changed the date of my periods by missing about one pill a pack in several previous packs, yes I'm a dummy. I had unprotected sex before and during my sugar pill week. I don't take the sugar pills. And both times only pre ejaculation fluid was released inside of me. I also had my period, much lighter but same length of time (4-5 days) at the end of the pill cycle. Lately I've had to pee every two hours and my breasts are very suddenly tender, especially my nipples. I've been getting slightly dizzy when I get up from laying down. Sorry TMI I've been constipated and my lower stomach feels stretched like on the inside. I'm on the second week of my birth control now. So, here's the question. Is it likely I'm pregnant?

My daughter is 7 weeks old, about 3 weeks ago a red mark started to appear on and above her lip on the right side. The doctor said it could be a birth mark or it could be from sucking. It is red, looks like broken blood vessel or little blood blister, it does not hurt her, it is not raised. It does not look like it has gotten bigger, just brighter. Any ideas on what I could use to help heal this and what it is?

Another thing is that she smells, not just the cigarrettes, but I dont think she takes care of herself (washes too well). This morning she took off her shoes and I felt sick. (Sorry Im really sensitive to these things since I had my baby), My nose has gotten stronger. Anyhow, Im not trying to be mean or anything.  Shes really nice and what not and good with the baby. Just wish this wasnt so bad.  Has anyone else dealt with this before?  It's bothering me. :( What can I do to solve this dilemna?

When I was on day 33 and 34 I took pregnancy tests which came back negative. I was cramping on days 26-30. These were severe cramps. My nipples have been sore ever since Ive been late, Ive been tired but cant sleep, and nauseated with daily headaches and I feel bloated all the time. Im starting to become miserable. I have not taken a pregnancy test since the negatives because I just dont want to see another negative. Im supposed to start shots to put me into medical menopause in March ( to help with endometriosis )but I cant start those til after AF comes.  Ive also been getting pains like the ones I get when I ovulate  but I know Im not ovulating. Anyone know what might be going on and how much longer should I wait until I go to the Dr?

20090227072531AA0uaIB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did you feel like you wanted more kids after you had your 1st baby?	I just had my first baby, a sweet boy. I love him so much and would do anything for him. Babies are a lot of work, and require a lot of attention. I can't imagine having another child (2 or 3 years old) to take care of as well. My labor went well, much better than I thought. It's just the uncomfortableness of being pregnant at the end and the after birth pain especially that sucks the most. I don't want anymore kids and I was an only child and swore I would never do that ( i hated not having any siblings) I just want to love and spoil this one to death. My husband would kind of like to have a girl. I don't think we could really afford more than one kid either.       So, how did you feel about more kids after you had your first baby?
20090227074026AAX0l7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast hurt when pumping?	I've been pumping and storing breast milk since my son was one month old, and I've not had a problem.  Last week I returned to work, and I've been pumping in the morning when I first get up, and twice at work.  I hadn't been having any problems at all with it, but suddenly for the last few days, it has been horrible.  I'm pumping as I type and I almost want to cry I'm so uncomfortable.  I never had this problem while I was pumping for my almost 3 year old, and as I said, until the last couple of days, I hadn't had this problem for my new baby (now 3 1/2 months).  I'm using the Madela Pump-In-Style, and I use the largest breast shields they sell.  I refuse to give my baby formula, so quitting isn't an option.  Does anyone have any idea what could be causing me to have so much discomfort suddenly?
