You need to get it from her...she may follow you but if she has other puppies, she won't leave them for long....Pick it up with a towel , wrap it up and bury it in your back yard....Sorry :(|`|gVQ6es5Taa	That is really really sad. But your right it has to be done. <br>  <br>  Does she have other puppies which are alive? Because that will help her. <br>  <br>  But either you need to get her from the basket (when she goes to the loo or for food/drink. Put the bowls a walk away from the basket. <br>  <br>  Or just take it, if she doesnt bite you, just take it :( Dont let her take it back, just get it out of there. <br>  <br>  very sad! Goodluck|`|FoeyqAZqaa	Take the mother outside as if letting her out to pee. Removed the puppy and put it some where that she can not find it. She will mourn for awhile but she will eventually forget all about the puppy. Does she have other puppies to look after? Is this her first litter?|`|yRN1ytjDaa	when  the mother goes out side i think it would be the best time to take the puppy don't let her see you with the puppy|`|RNkQ9qPQaa	Just grab the damn dead dog, put it in  a plastic bag and bury it. Quit being a puss about the whole deal.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Pick the pup up and take it away................Done!|`|AA12128656	show her the dead pup. let her nuzzle it around so she can see that it's dead. then she should let you take it out easily. if not, remove mom, take the pup, put mom back.|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Clip the mother's leash on her & take her out to potty. While she is outside, remove the dead puppy.|`|D1beU6MPaa	This is very unusual as most Mom's will push a dead puppy aside. If Mom is just grabbing your hand and not trying to be aggressive, put the puppy in your hand and show it to her so that she can smell it, and see it. Once she knows the puppy is dead, she should allow you to remove it. I'm so sorry this happened, but it is very unusual that a Mom doesn't push a dead pup aside. Good luck|`|NJfpY7nIaa	Remove the mother from the room first(with the other puppies). Then remove the baby. Get someone to help you if she is too heavy to move yourself. Don't try to tempt the mother out by carrying another of the alive babies out...that could cause issues. Just take the puppies in a basket to another room with her...have it supervised. Make sure you wash your hands with just water before touching the babies(don't use any scented soap).  Or you can pick them up with gloves or a washrag as to not leave any of your scent.<br>  Why were you not supervising her and the puppies?<br>  <br>  Please get your dog spayed when the puppies are weaned. There are too many homeless puppies. Not to mention, you're obviously not experienced and shouldn't be breeding.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Right now she may not know that it is dead.  When she does realize it is dead she may try to eat it or push it to the side.  Either way is natures way.  <br>  <br>  Why do people think that they need to breed their pets.  It is just wrong.  You dog is pet quality at best even if registered with AKC.  Too many people breeding their pets is what has cause the over population of dogs & cats.

Or wait until she knows what has happened.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You shouldn't have let her get pregnant in the first place. Neither you, nor she, know what to do.<br>  <br>  You need to take the puppy away NOW and bury it.  She'll miss it, and may even look for it, but will eventually give up and go back to her living pups to care for them.
FoeyqAZqaa	Try ebay for the cubes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Paper bags and cardboard boxes can be used as hiding places, scratching posts and for chewing. Make sure there are two areas for your rabbit to enter and exit. A large cardboard box turned over with holes cut big enough for the rabbit to go inside and disappear are quite popular. Each day change the boxes as bunnies get bored easily. Use long boxes like those for fluorescent lights (open on each end) and computer boxes, which are turned over with holes cut in each end so he has his own burrow.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cardboard rolls from toilet paper and paper towels are great chew toys.<br>  <br>  <br>  Boxes full of shredded paper, junk mail or magazines can be used for playful digging and scratching.<br>  <br>  <br>  Toys from other sources can also be used for bunnies. Cat toys that your bunny can roll or toss and bird toys that can be hung and batted or chewed can be fun. Even human baby rattles or mobiles make great playthings for rabbits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hard plastic lids from laundry detergent and softener bottles (carefully washed and rinsed) make excellent toys. They are easy to grasp with teeth and, as an added bonus, make great noises.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dried pine cones, straw whisk brooms, hand towels and even old telephone books can keep your rabbit busy for hours. <br>  <br>  <br>  Since rabbits love to chew, consider offering your bunny twigs as toys. If taken from a tree outside, age the wood for at least 3 months. An exception is an apple tree twig, which can be eaten straight off the tree. However, some twigs are poisonous – avoid twigs from cherry, peach, apricot, plum or redwood trees. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I use rabbit litter for mine. You should never use pine. It gets in their longs and can cause death.|`|Idunjsxjaa	Cubes for playpen-Walmart sells them.  I purchased a rabbit exercise pen from Petsmart for mine.  Petsmart also sells them online.  It's nice because it folds up for when I need to clean his area.<br>  <br>  Homemade toys-I give mine empty toilet paper/paper towel rolls.  You can fill them with timothy hay.  Mine loves to throw them and nibble on them.<br>  <br>  Cube ideas-I bought my rabbit a cat tunnel and he loves it.  It's long in length and it's collapsible which is nice if I need to move it or put it away.<br>  <br>  Litter-Never use pine or cedar for your rabbit it's not good for rabbits.  I never use cat litter either, it too is not good for rabbits.  In his litter box I put Care Fresh litter because it obsorbs his urine and I put some aspen bedding over top of that.  In his cage I just use the aspen bedding because he's a lionhead rabbit and the Care Fresh is a bit dusty and gets all over him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
XI2iylR4aa	A rehoming fee is like an adoption fee.  Usually it is under $100, depending on what kind of animal you're talking about.  For Parrots and big tropical birds, it is likely to be more, because those birds are very expensive and live a very long time.<br>  <br>  I've read that it's a really good idea to charge a rehoming fee, that way your pet doesn't end up in a laboratory or on someone's plate.<br>  <br>  However, some people charge huge "rehoming fees" of more than $100 for a dog or cat, and I've seen fees over $300.  These people are just trying to sell their animals, that are probably the result of intentional breeding by a misinformed backyard breeder.<br>  <br>  I would definitely try to adopt from a shelter first.  Their animals are usually vet-checked and neutered beforehand.  Good luck!|`|XK9RLaPeaa	If you are looking on Petfinder, the animals there usually come from shelters or rescues. So if it says rehoming fee, through the shelter/rescue, then its just the standard adoption fee. They charge about $60 to adopt an animal because they have been spayed/neutered, and have all the vaccinations. If you are looking online and the ad is placed by a random person that wants a fee, then dont get him. It could be a backyard breeder that just wants to make some quick money. Your best bet would be to go to a shelter instead of looking online. There you can see all the animals, and pick one that is right for you. The adoption fees help feed the other animals that come into the shelter. And you will be saving the life of an animal that would have been otherwise euthanized. When they are on craigslist they have more time to find a home than the shelter animals do. Good luck! Thanks for choosing to adopt!|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Some people still rehome their unwanted pets for free, but this is generally not recommended.<br>  <br>  There are some unscrupulous people out there looking for "free" animals for all sorts of nasty reasons - from puppy farmers wanted unneutered animals to breed from, to morons who just like abusing animals. Many of the people who specifically want a pet for free are just irresponsible - they want a pet but don't want the expense.<br>  <br>  Many people therefore ask for a "rehoming fee" to put off these dodgy people and help ensure their animals go to a good home. It should be a reasonable fee - not so cheap as to be pointless, but not too expensive either. If the rehoming fee seems particularly high it may well be a breeder trying to sell but pretending it is a genuine rehoming. (This is commonly the case with baby animals).|`|UvPUopA8aa	Petfinder has adoption fees that covers the animals vetting vaccinations,spay,neuter ect. the ads on petfinder are from non-profit organizations shelters and rescues. Those adoption fees fund the animals care.<br>  <br>  On craiglist a reasonable re-homing fee is mostly to insure a pet owners pet will be placed with the right hands. Theirs alot of nuts on there that will take free pets off others, only to turn around and sell them back on craigslist to make money. It's really sick!
DtkLsetkaa	No.  Anyone who advertises something along the lines of a "teacup" kitten are scamming, and the poor kittens are not much more than the runts of the litter of 2 runts of 2 other litters.  They are underbred, unhealthy animals.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Not really.  As in dogs (with the teacup, mini, etc.) you have breeders that are breeding undersized cats and selling them very overpriced and sickly animals for pets.  These are known as "backyard breeders or puppy/kitten mills".<br>  <br>  Cats are small to begin with - why make them smaller?  The smallest breeds are Sinagpura (4-5 lbs) or Cornish Rexes (5-6 lbs).  So why do you think cats should be smaller then this?|`|IuYekkPVaa	There are some miniature cats from genuine breeders where the trait has been fixed by selective breeding.  However due to the limited gene pool and reputable breeders limiting the number of kittens to ensure the health of the mother cat, such cats are rare and extremely expensive.

utbfT0APaa	Any flavor that is good for you will be good for the pooch...........|`|AA11992723	I don't think the added sugar or dairy is good for dogs. you can buy a human grade probiotic to help her digestive system. Yogurt doesn't have enough probiotics in it to benefit dogs.You also do not want to give yogurt regularly to a growing puppy, especially a giant breed like Great danes who should not have any excess amounts of calcium in order to keep their growth rate slow.<br>  <br>  Instead of getting advice on here about nutrition (because some advice can be deadly since sugar free yogurt has artificial sweeteners which can be poisonous to dogs) you might want to get a good book about canine nutrition.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	They make dog food for called sensitive system formula and yogurt is already in the food.  It is made of ingredients that are easy for a dog to digest.  In the mean time I would choose a plain yogurt.  www. missouri scenic rivers. com/ bad dog foods .html is a good site for foods that are bad for dogs.|`|a29qiNkvaa	Plain is the best,but my 2 love any yogurt.

Don't give her too much unless it is recommended by a vet because dogs are lactose intolerant and will get severe diarrhoea from it.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	Fat free/Low fat, PLAIN is the best for her. All those other flavors you mentioned have excess sugar/colorings that your dog does NOT need.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You want to be giving the dog a natural, plain yogurt.  The flavored stuff doesn't have as much of the good bacteria that helps with digestion in it.  Go find a healthfood store and ask them for a natural plain yogurt and they'll show you what you need.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	My vet told me to use sugar free yogurt.  Sugar and lactose are bad for dogs, but yogurt has very minimal lactose and if you buy sugar free that is taken care of as well.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Add:  Wow, by the looks of it I must need a new vet!|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Why not call your vet and ask? The vet knows far more about your pups health needs than anyone here does. A phone call to the vet does not cost anything.|`|LywVUxsTaa	Plain yogurt is best because it doesn't have sugar (or fake sweetener).  Dogs like plain yogurt, even if it tastes yucky to us!
L22hVXTIaa	Toy breeds especially are prone to teeth problems because of their small size.  If your dog has retained baby teeth, they may or may NOT come out by themselves. <br>  <br>  I have had to have baby teeth extracted on my Chihuahuas for the very reason your vet mentioned re overcrowding.  One of my dogs had two retained baby teeth right next to their canines (the large teeth on corner of the mouth), so food was always getting caught in between and the tartar/plaque really built up.  When the vet did pull the baby teeth, he said they were in their solid (the dog was already 2 years old).  <br>  <br>  While it's not emergency vet care - it should be done as soon as you can swing it since it most probably will cause problems for your dog later on.|`|GT6396BDaa	Talk with your vet about what all of your options are, and ask him what they recommend.Explain your situation, and I'm sure they would be willing to do a payment plan.<br>  I don't know how severe the crowding of the dog's teeth are, but if it's not bad, your dog may not have that bad of a bite.  <br>  Talk with your vet.  Even get a second opinion, to see what a different vet would recommend for your puppy.  Best of luck.  Hope I helped.|`|AA10500537	check with another vet sometimes some of these vets are looking for extra ,money.<br>  im not saying all of them  but some do.<br>  if you have faith in your vet  you should let him do the work it needs|`|qapJU3tMaa	It's SHIH Tzu.  Please find your dog another home if you cannot afford proper medical attention.  Your health guarantee should help cover the cost of your dog's visit.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Poor breeding does this.

H06PtiIAaa	saltwater tankss... 101... smaller is for experts as beginners fail 95% of the time because they think smaller tanks are easier.... but<br>  <br>  the smaller the saltwater tank the harder it is to care for because it isnt freshwater....there are more water parameters and 10 gallons isnt enough space for alot of fish and the water parameters will check daily so you will need to check and fix any fulcuations everyday.<br>  <br>  beginners should start with at least 55 gallons.<br>  <br>  a 29 is still not a beginner tank.. etiher get a larger tank or stick with freshwater only.|`|mOayTJDmaa	What fish do you have in the 29 gallon?  And what saltwater fish are you getting?  Saltwater fish need at least twice as much space as fresh water.  So you can get 2 fish that won't grow bigger than 2 inches for the 10g salt water tank.
IuYekkPVaa	There seems to be myth that an outside cat is an unloved one.  <br>  <br>  I understand that in some areas of the world that it's much safer to keep cats indoor- only due to local dangers, and that's a commendable attitude.  However, we don't all live in the same neighbourhood, nor do all cats have the same personality, and sometimes people fail to take those factors into account when answering questions.  <br>  <br>  As an outside cat, if he wasn't happy in your care, he would have run away by now.  As long as you are providing him with food, love and medical care (and it sounds like you do), then I think his approval is the only one that matters.|`|d8d70f3ce62baea0a8cb1a01e21e326faa	people care more for pets than humans. they have no problem with the homeless person sleeping and starving out on the street. what a messed up society we have. my neighborhood has outdoor cats and i am grateful for them they help keep smaller pest away and stray cats, so as long as you feed them don't worry about it!|`|paerqxfMaa	Probably got to do with the fact that he's relieving himself in your neighbors gardens.|`|4TX26viFaa	Outdoor cats in our area--if feral live to about 2 years of age before getting killed by dogs or cars.<br>  <br>  Any 'tame' cat that lets a person approach gets stolen by kids to sell to the dog fighting rings as training fodder.  Some dumb **** was cutting tails off cats in the area last year (I know feral feeders who wanted to take a baseball bat to whoever it was).

It is a risk, but better than keeping an unhappy cat couped up all the time.  Especially if you live in the country, it can be fine for them to be outside.  People on here also get antsy when people say they leave their dog at home alone while they are at work...of course that is what most people do, but on here there are many answerers who say they shouldn't be able to own a dog and are terrible people.  I don't get it either!  Best of luck with the cat in the new house!|`|RvddYKqjaa	Cats do damage to bird sanctuaries that other people choose to have in their back yards. Every day I put food out for birds, and everyday I find feathers and parts of birds, where other people's pets have been running loose. Dogs have to have a license and tags. Cats need nothing. They just run loose and pee in other peoples' yards, and hide in their bushes to kill birds and chipmunks. I have nothing against cats, but I have something against cat owners who can't keep their pets at home. I've several neighbors who have indoor cats. Our family extended has a indoor cat. They have a harness they can put on the cat to take it for a walk in their own yard, but the cat is content indoors. My dog may want to run the neighborhood too, but we keep her within a fenced in yard. She spends most time indoors. During the summer I leave a hose outdoors, so I can turn it on and drown the cats. It doesn't hurt them, but they do hate getting wet. So if it keeps them away from my wildlife sanctuaries for just a little while, I've served my purpose. EDIT: I don't really care who has a cat that never bothers anyone. Everyone feels that way. Your cat is not mine, and I don't want that cat in my yard. I have often asked people to at least put a bell on their cat's collar, so the birds can be alerted. You like cats. I like birds. My birds don't bother your cats. Keep them away from other people's gardens. And don't call us rude because we don't want your pet's messes to deal with. If your cat is good, no one in your neighborhood is complaining.|`|ece6164651e8c46ee0724690594ca683aa	We have a cat now that we "inherited" from my parents after they died.

She's well cared for and is still friendly. OK, now I'm ready for all the "thumbs down" votes I'm going to get for letting her outside. By the way, we live in the country, away from roads, and the large German Shepherd keeps the raccoons and other wildlife away from the house, which she never wanders too far from, anyway. Oh, yeah.

My cats would lose their friggin' minds if they couldn't go out.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	My cats are inside and outside cats. My mother is allergic to them so in the winter we put them in our basement, but during the summer they are out all summer long.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I didn't read your other question but I'll answer this one. I have 2 Ragdolls and since they're too mellow to the point they won't defend themselves, they are safer indoors. Some cats do just fine with being indoors and outdoors, but I think the reason you received so many negative answers is because outdoor cats are more exposed to danger. For example: being hit by a car, eating mice or birds that can give cats worms, getting hurt in so many ways that it's impossible to be specific. But I know someone that has a Russian Blue and he's allowed to go outdoors every day, and he will come back home for food and at night to sleep. Another thing to be careful of, is if your cat is not neutered, he may find a female stray cat and get her pregnant. In the end, it's YOUR choice. But statistics show that an indoor cat lives more than 12 years since they're kept in a safe environment, but an outdoor cat only lives 5 years in average, since he's exposed to dangers such as getting hit by a car, contracting some kind of disease from another animal, or getting hurt in numerous ways. Keep that in mind :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VOIOKYEvaa	I'm not going to criticize you for allowing your cat to be outside, and I haven't seen where you live so I don't know what kind of danger your cat would be in. Nevertheless, my indoor cat (also neutered) runs off for days whenever I let him outside. I'm afraid to let him out because I freak out when he's gone that long. I let him roam around our dog run sometimes or I just follow him around the yard to make sure he's not sneaking away. It does seem cruel to have a cat cooped up in a house when they enjoy being outside so much, but I also worry about his safety. I wouldn't want my kids to play outside unsupervised, and I'm no different with my pets. <br>  Here is a list of things that go through my head when my cat runs off: <br>  He's being tortured by some sadistic kid <br>  He was hit by a car<br>  He was eaten by coyotes or the neighbor's dog<br>  He was stolen <br>  He got stuck somewhere|`|b7251248d25cc960ef15136aa9f0c085aa	Honestly, people who disagree with having cats outdoors probably fall into two different categories. One, they worry for the safety of the cat since it is largely unsupervised when it is outdoors. Two, they are not cat lovers, and would prefer to not have their neighbor's cat on their property. That being said, I see no problem with allowing a cat to spend time outdoors if your current living situation allows for it. Living in an apartment in the middle of a city isn't the best place to let a cat outside, but just about anywhere and they should be fine. Cats are very independent animals. Yes, they do hunt, but that is their natural instinct. My two cats are indoor/outdoor cats. They only rules we keep in place for them are that they are not allowed outside after dark, and we only feed them in the house. They don't like the litter box, and prefer to do their business outside. Also, the exercise is good for them. I would say that if you personally are comfortable with allowing your cat to spend time outdoors, you know the risks of letting a cat spend time outside. It is your pet, and as long as the cat is not being destructive to your neighbor's property (hunting is small wild animals is not destructive; it is instinct), then it should not concern them how you care for your pet.|`|kdBhSqqfaa	I think they're just thinking about the dangers that can exist outside for them. Cats have very sensitive noses, and to them, antifreeze smells sweet and appetizing. Also, there is always the risk of them being sTrueck by a vehicle or being hurt by another animal. I understand where you are coming from though, I want to let my cat run around too. I am going to wait until she is a bit older and not as hyper and then I think I'll be able to trust her more. Either way, people should not have given you rude answers. Don't listen to them, it sounds like you are providing your cat with a warm, loving home :).|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I think part of the problem is people thinking their situation represents everyone's situation.  Folks, just because you have laws that say all cats need to be on a leash in public, or you have coyotes, doesn't mean that applies to everyone posting here!  I don't think a lot of people realize that this is Yahoo Answers general, and it appears the USA crowd don't actually have their own site... People from all over the world on here, LOL.  Here in England the RSPCA is reluctant to re-home to people who DON'T let their cats out...<br>  <br>  Personally my cats have been inside cats most of their lives.  I live in the city and am well aware of the dangers of busy roads, nasty humans etc.  But if I lived in a safer place, my cats would have gone out (and in fact did when we lived in such a place).  I think the lower life expectancy of outside cats is largely accounted for by idiots who let their cats near roads and out uneutered.  Remember that is an AVERAGE figure we are talking about.  Many many cats who are allowed near roads die in their first year.  But, if they survive, or are not allowed out in a dangerous place, they can live just as long as indoor cats.<br>  <br>  Dangers to wildlife can be reduced by not letting your cat out at dawn and dusk, and by putting a bell on their collar.|`|DtkLsetkaa	It boils down to a LONG list of "what ifs".  You say your cat is lazy, what if it falls asleep in someones wheel well and get hurt?  What if he runs across a street at a bad time?  What if the neighbors dog is violent, even tho your cat is completely kind and docile?  Its a matter of safety.  Dogs are let out ON A LEASH or in a FENCED IN YARD.  Yes, accidents happen, but not for lack of caring for the animal, simply because they are just accidents.  Cat can be perfectly fine indoors, and if you want to take them out, enclose your yard and supervise them, or leash train.  Just because your child WANTS to go outside unsupervised, would you let him?  Its your cat, do what you want.  But being blunt in the Cats section is sometimes the only way we get through to people who really have already made up their mind.  I won't let my cats outside, I don't want them to get hurt or sick.  What you do with your cats is your business, but this is why i am Anti-outside.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	When you move keep him in for a few days then go out into the garden with him. He won't go far, he'll be too busy sniffing the new smells every 6 inches.|`|E0chY1b5aa	Sounds like the cat is happier outside.  I'm assuming you keep thawed water outside, or you live where it's not normally that cold.  You're not being negligent.  Take Care.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I'd rather my neighbors keep their cats inside.  They poop in my garden.  Maybe they should be leashed if they can't stay in their own yard.|`|3arJsZ91aa	Some people just don't realise that cats can do fine outside.  Not everywhere has busy roads, coyotes and vats full of anti-freeze just waiting to kill our cats.  Every cat owner has the right to decide whether their cat is safe outside or not.  Of course those of you in the USA who declaw as a matter of course, can never let your cats outside, but those of us that live in quiet areas that are comparitively safe can and do allow our cats some freedom.<br>  <br>  I suggest that if your cat seems comfortable in his new home, you accompany him outside the first time he goes out.  Make sure that it is feeding time so that he won't go too far.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I advocate indoors only.  However, for those that feel the cat has to go outside (for whatever reason), then I recommend that they are out ONLY under supervision - not roaming around unsupervised.<br>  <br>  Either train to a harness/leash and go out with them a few times a day.  Or you can build/buy a secure cat enclosure (pen) that the cat can sit outside in safety.  Otherwise you are putting your cat at too many risks.<br>  <br>  I'd rather my cat be supervised outside then to worry about if and when he may come home.  I'm assuming your cat IS neutered.
wuQCq0e8aa	you could call it racist.<br>  <br>  they are just afraid of the bigger dogs-they just wont admit it.<br>  <br>  i asked my chihuahua why she doesnt like bigger dogs, n she said that she's just shy.  but i put her in her place!! lol i told her that even shy dogs can get to know other ones, and learn to love!!!  then she growled at me ran upstairs. :(|`|AA12128656	lol....<br>  my m-i-l has HORRID little dachshunds and chihuauas, and they pretty much seem to hate everyone equally. i think they're afraid of getting stepped on by bigger dogs. or maybe it ruins their self-image that they are HUGE...|`|2G6b5y8Taa	lol that is funny but i don't think its true i have a small dog and she don't like other small dogs she loves big dog though|`|QYbMxFE0aa	I think this question is funny and very open minded. I think they are just scared.. just think if there was a guy that came up to you that was like 2-3 feet taller then you. i think you'd be a lil scared too. Especially if he bent down and went straight for your butt.. haha|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Animals don't understand the concept of racism. They just like to be eye to eye with other dogs.............Don't make it out to be more than it is....|`|YNj2i2Inaa	I can't believe someone who asks such a foolish question can write in complete sentences.|`|vcBINj8caa	the second part
KeevlZnTaa	You need to keep a close eye on your rat, or even give a vet a call. One of the dangers of purell is the fact that is is mainly alcohol. There is even a warning to keep it away from children for that very reason. A animal as small as a rat can easily die from taking in too much alcohol, so watch him closely.|`|juyA6HUJaa	If it was poison you wouldn't be rubbing it on your hands. It's an antiseptic which probably wont harm the rat, not in such a small amount anyway, try not to worry. If it really bothers you phone the vet.
AA10029366	Because a cat is a cat.<br>  <br>  There is little variation in size and overall temperament. They all hunt rodents, sleep on your windowsill, and like catnip.<br>  <br>  The only reason anyone has tried to make cats "purebred" and isolate traits like color and coat is for looks/marketability.<br>  <br>  In a word, they aren't much like dogs.<br>  <br>  I completely believe that all cats should be spayed and neutered. There are plenty of feral cats living in every corner of civilization to keep us "catted out" for years. In fact, they are one of the few domesticated animals that could continue to exist if humans vanished off the face of the earth tomorrow.<br>  <br>  I consider anyone who allows their cats to run around and breed to be just as irresponsible as anyone doing so with a dog.<br>  <br>  But if your main concern is "mixing", it isn't the same thing. Cats were never carved out to serve various purposes, and their forms haven't changed much in the thousands of years they've existed.<br>  <br>  You can't really compare the two.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	All cats are mixed, except for a small number of pure-bred enthusiasts who would never dream of letting fifi out to mate with the neighborhood tom cat.  Cats don't have to go outside, so litters are so much more preventable, but unplanned kittens are as bad as unplanned puppies.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	i rescue dogs, not cats (i'm allergic and not set up for cats).<br>  nothing mixed should be allowed to breed.|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I can see if the dog is a registered pure breed and the owner doesn't want the sneaky neighbors dog so to speak getting at it specially if its a different breed or maybe a mix breed. I had that problem with some neighbor girls trying to put their male chihuahua/ pomeranian cross in with my pure breed pomeranian while i had her out to potty, I told the girls i only wanted a pure breed registered pom to breed with her not a mix or a different breed, i haven't had a problem since with them.<br>   Same would go for a pure breed registered cat but most people who own those don't allow them to go outside and prowl the neighborhoods, now if the cat wasn't pure breed i don't think many people would care kittens are real easy to give away and they are easy to box train as well. <br>   With a mix breed or mutt you can't ask for a whole lot when you sell them not like you can when you breed two pure breeds, plus its harder to potty train dogs, and they usually come with their first set of shots, so not only is it costly for the person with the ***** its time consuming raising them and selling them. If that makes any sense?<br>   If people don't want pups they should have their dogs fixed plain and simple. Or keep a close watch on them.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	People just don't think about cats much.  They are there, but they are quiet, aloof, and go relatively unnoticed.  Most people only have mixed cats and alot of them don't even know that cats have "breeds" like dogs.  <br>  <br>  Dogs are bigger, louder, around people more, and generally get more attention than the average cat.  Dogs also cost more to feed and care for than cats do.<br>  <br>  It's not right to have a mixed litter of any kind; cat or dog.  I believe there are more breeds of cats than dogs actually.  Either way, word needs to get around to spay/neuter cats as well as dogs (that aren't of show quality, health tested, or with good pedigree).<br>  <br>  Seems to be the same with people if you think about it.  If a young teen gets pregnant everyone jumps at the chance to holler abortion or adoption...but if an older person, that may be in a worse situation than the young teen, gets pregnant no one really says anything.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	Personally, I think all animals (unless of breeding quality - passing genetic testing, both parents are PROVEN champions, etc) should be neutered.  There is no excuse to have more puppies born a day than humans - there will never ever ever be enough homes even if every person had their own dog.  The same is true with cats - although cats can have more litters a year than dogs.  <br>  <br>  There are so many cheap and free neutering programs out there that there is really no excuse.  This is why adopted animals come neutered.  <br>  <br>  Cat and dog overpopulation in this country is the main cause for all of the homeless pets being killed every year.  If you breed (unless responsibly, as described above) you are a part of the problem.|`|NgZJzEWUaa	I imagine if you hung out in the cat section, you'd hear the cat people saying the same thing. Cats are virtually impossible to adopt at shelters and die in even more numbers than dogs.  It's heartbreaking.  <br>  <br>  The cat people have had to resort to trapping feral cats, spaying and neutering them and then releasing them.  THAT is desperation. <br>  <br>  Owning an animal of any kind requires responsiblity. Breeding ANY animal is something that 99% of the population should never undertake for any reason.  We have enough of all "pet" animals.|`|UTugWDsFaa	Since this is the dog section, the main focus is on dogs. I have seen people "go off" on owners of cats that let them run while in heat in the cat section. They are just as passion about it as any dog owner.<br>  I live in the country, and end up with at least 3 pregnant females every spring and have to clean up after someone's stupidity or laziness. I am forever ranting about it, but not here in the dog section.<br>  The cat problem has gotten so bad in town that they have started a 75 dollar fine for letting your cats run free. The second offence, the cat is removed.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	I don't agree w/breeding mutt dogs or mutt cats. i don't see a difference.|`|YYCmXfuMaa	i personally think its because cats are more self sufficent and can fend for themselves outside a home when people dont want them or they end up lost. plus they hide WAY better then dogs do so you see them less often on the streets or they are cheeper to feed so people own more then average.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Unwanted crap cats are just as bad as dogs & their owners just as lazy cheap ignorant & culpable.<br>  Feral cats are more destructive than dogs but less visible ,being smaller,shyer & nocturnal .|`|WWhYCAbSaa	I don't agree with people being irresponsible owners of any type of animal.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	I don't agree with indiscriminately breeding anything!!!!!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	There are irresponsible dog owners and cat owners.

zpwJR60baa	Hi, there are diaper for dogs at the pet store.  But I would ask a pet advise.. looks like when your dog get nervous or excited he can control his bladder.  This is a health problem...
YFTZM86maa	You know how guinea pigs will put about anything in their mouth, well, I'd hate for him to eat some tort poop and get sick.  I agree with another response about torts carrying illnesses like salmonella.  It would be great to have them out at the same time, so I think you should build a barrier for between them that will keep them both safe and which can also let them see each other.|`|qTfju2ggaa	I wouldn't put them out together....although torts have hard shells they can also give a pretty hard nip (I know as I've got a grumpy Horsefield tort). Also tortoise poo can contain nasty bacteria sch as salmonella and I personally wouldn't want to put any other animals at risk of catching anything .|`|fi4RKcjnaa	it probably would be okay, just watch out for any cats or dogs or any carnivorous birds.
qeOlkRM0aa	My birds never cared for Zupreem.<br>  I used to give my parrots Roudybush, not only did they like it (alot), they seemed to thrive on it. Unfortunately, about 8 or 9 years ago They had some distribution issues, and I could no longer get it in 50 lb bags, or any quantity for a while. I eventually had to switch them  (my 3 big birds) over to Kaytee Exact.<br>  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend  Roudybush -I assume the supply issue is long since fixed.|`|QxIhMHwAaa	I feed Zupreem (mainly the natural pellets with a few of the color ones mixed in) to my green cheek conure. She loves them. Zupreem is what is recommended by my vet as well. Thats primarily why I use them. I've never heard of Roudybush before, so I really don't have anything to compare them to. I have heard though that Zupreem and Harrisons are the most popular/best to use though.|`|UhV82EaXaa	if u want 2 switch, make the transition slow, like mix both pellets in the bowel them more of the other variety day by day, thats what i did with my cockatoo :)
f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Have they done allergy testing on him yet? I went through a similar experience with my shepherd last Fall. He had been scratching himself almost raw. He did the antibiotic regimen, then antihistamines,<br>  as well as topical sprays and betedine baths. Finally we had his blood work sent to be tested for allergies. It turns out that he has a severe allergy to dust mites. Gone are my area rugs, I vac my leather sofa and treat it weekly with a dust mite spray. His bed is washed on a weekly basis.<br>    I also started adding wild salmon oil (available at smartpaks.com) to his food every morning.<br>    No more skin problems. Lots of $ spent at the vet. <br>  Did I mention that I love my good old 10 yr old Alphie?  ( :|`|OudgeZucaa	Have you tried changing the food around? My Pitty used to get rashes (and have upset stomach) until I switched her to "Natural Choice" dog food for sensitive stomach & skin- in a purple bag. She loves the food and has been rash free for 8 months!
iasOicRjaa	Here is a tip you can try....enlist the help of some friends to come over to the house and have them ready with some doggy treats. As they come over and knock on the door or ring the bell have her go with you to the door as they come in instruct them to drop the treats to the ground for her to eat. Have lots of people do this several times for several days until she starts to seem excited and happy to hear a knock at the door. You can also place a small bag of doggy treats on the door knob with a little note for unexpected guests. If you do this enough times she will learn to associate guests with treats. Eventually you can have people try to give her the treat by hand after she is less mad. <br>  <br>  By spraying her in the face every time she barked at the door she may have learned to associate guests at the door with being squirted. Try this technique to see if you can recondition her to associate guests with pleasant stimuli. Good Luck !! :-)|`|OxFsslN8aa	Many Many dogs are shy.  Your dog is probably shy and with shyness comes fear.  When a dog is fearful they can be aggressive which is what your dog sounds like.  Check online for information about counter-conditioning to help your dog get over her fear of unfamiliar people.  It is a training technique by which you slowly introduce strangers to her from a distance & then slowly move the dog forward until she is at a point where she is comfortable with the stranger.  It takes months - or years - and a ton of treats as positive reinforcements.  If your dog is worth it, I would suggest looking into it.<br>  <br>  The worst thing you can do is to force your dog to be touched by unfamiliar people.  Each time she growls and the stranger goes away, she feels like that is best way to get them to go.  You are actually reinforcing her fears.  Anytime she growls, the stranger needs to stand their ground & move away when she is calm.  <br>  <br>  Have your dog on a leash when strangers/unfamiliar people are going to be around her & tell them not to look her in the eye, talk to her or reach down to pet her.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	She sounds like a dog who thinks she runs the house.<br>  <br>  She needs discipline, but not with a water bottle.  All a spray bottle does is get the dogs attention on you.  You still have to discipline the dog at that point.  The best way I have found is to simply tell the dog NO or STOP.  If she ignores me, then I give her a firm touch on the neck and repeat NO.  That is all it takes with most dogs.<br>  <br>  Do you take your dog for walks?  That would be a good way to start teaching her that she needs to listen to you, not just do whatever she wants.  Make her walk beside you, at a good pace, and she is not allowed to stop until you say so.<br>  <br>  A training class would be a big help, but you can start the walking on your own.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	She needs more obedience training and socialization.  Try to find a trainer that is teaching CGC's classes (canine good citizen).  Make your goal to be being able to pass the CGC.|`|AA11788494	It sounds like you need to put her up when you have guests.|`|DoHaUEziaa	Sounds like you both need some training. Take a class with her. Obedience classes are designed as much, if not more, for the owner as well as the dog. She really needs to know basic commands such as come, sit, down, stay, leave it (this includes people) and enough/hush/w/e. Without yours or someone else's guidance, she really will just be confused as to what she is supposed to do. With training, she will learn what is appropriate and you will have a better trained buddy. You have to devote your time and resources and stick with the program for your dog's sake and your sanity. I wish you and your pup the best of luck.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you need to see a professional trainer who can make an assessment on the dog and the way you work with her before the problem gets worse|`|jr2yqSJqaa	Take her to a dog trainer.  It will help.|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	Take her to a training program that deals with problem dogs. Spraying her is not nearly as effective as taking a soda can and putting a small handful of pennies in it. Tape over the opening. When she barks inappropriately, shake it hard and give her a firm "No Bark" command. Dogs have very sensitive ears and don't like the loud noise so they won't try and compete with the can. This also works very well for jumping. <br>    Spend time with her, be patient and she will improve. Almost all dogs will bark at a stranger, but growling at company in your home is not acceptable behavior.
78im4WUcaa	Yeah, would ensure they weather outside was a minimum of 75 degrees. I would also make sure the lawn hasnt been treated with any pesticides or fertalizer in recent days.<br>  Like others have said check for insects when your going to take your snake back inside.<br>  Essentially just use common sense.

KeevlZnTaa	Some rats take longer to be comfortable with people than others, and some rats just don't like being picked up. I currently have a little boy that is very sweet, he will sit with me, take food, etc, but he does not like to be pick up. He struggles when I pick him up, but is fine once I get him in my arms.<br>  <br>  Are your girls comfortable once you have them in your arms? I assume it must be scary when something grabs you and lifts you off the ground. You could try teaching them to come into your hand and then lift them(small steps for this, don't coax them into your hand and then quickly lift them out of the cage). <br>  <br>  Have you been taking them out of the cage for bonding or just feeding and petting them while they were in the cage? You may want to try forced bonding, where you just take them from the cage and put them in a towel or pocket(makes them feel more secure), until they are used to you.<br>  <br>  I forced bonded my little guy by first having him in a towel on my lap. I completely covered him with a towel so he felt safe. When he was used to the towel I placed my hand in next to him, the next step was to pet him in the towel(it was still totally covering him). The step I go to after that is to get a old sweater with large pockets(I use a sweater that is about 2x to big for me, and the pockets are huge). I put him in the pocket and put my hand in(didn't pet him). The next step was to pet him. He now is able to sit on my lap with out towel or a pocket. He still hates being picked up though.|`|17ovKbITaa	Don't worry too much, I have four and 3 of them love it and one just does not like people, she's ok when shes out and about but she hates being picked up, she runs away.<br>  <br>  Try just putting your hand there and keep it still until they climb on. It is frustrating and it takes time but it does work, i did it with the mine and now they all climb on, except the one that doesn't ever like coming out.<br>  <br>  They mite just be happy socialising between them, remeber they are still quite young as well so may just be nervous.<br>  <br>  I am sure they will gradually become confident at being picked up and will soon love it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|mIQJqIOBaa	maybe the rats are a bit scared and are just settling in to there new surroundings. they will soon like u picking them up my hamster was the same at first<br>  <br>  <br>  allways happy to help|`|UlOKMInqaa	I too have three female rats and have had them for just about a month now. They don't like to be picked up too much either but they are getting used to it now that they know me more. Females tend to be more active and may just want to look around and have fun rather than being picked up and/or held. When I'm playing with them in a room I try to pick them up once in awhile just so they get used to it and so far it's helped for when I need to get them out of the cage. Also, they like to feel secure when you're picking them up so make sure you have a hand supporting their feet and lower part of the body while the other hand is over their back. You should never pick a rat up by its tail. This can cause degloving (meaning that the skin separates from the bone) which is very painful for the rat and will likely result in a trip to the vet for a tail amputation.
SZOMVGBRaa	I agree that the glass ones are the way to go UNLESS you have a really big tank or really rowdy fish. But most fish that are big enough to break threw glass tanks can't fit in a 55 gallon anyways. Glass in my opinion has better visibility, most say acrylic does. I don't go along with that school of thought though. Good Luck|`|AHEFXgE7aa	I love mine.  It has an internal overflow filter that is easy to set up a wet/dry filter.  It has a few scratches, but it doesn't bother me.  It's light, long lasting, and no problems at all.  The price you can get yours is great.  It includes everything too.  Good luck<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|fMiLQnSJaa	I prefer glass cause I had an acrylic tank and even though I was always careful not to scratch it, in about a year it looked like sh*t.  Now it's just sitting in my garage and one of these days I'm going to throw it away.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	I've got a glass one and an acrylic, I prefer the glass.  Yes the marks can be worked out, but not without a great deal of effort and it never looks quite the same.  I've never scratched the glass one, so I had no problems dealing with scratches on it.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|AA11708471	2 out of the 4 acrylic tanks I own (the 2 five gallons)  have cracks in them (at the top so I can still fill them almost full)<br>  <br>  I prefer glass
u7vrul2Faa	My mum insists on over feeding our cats, thankfully one cat does not get fat because she is a faddy eater but the other cat is getting fatter and less active which is not a good thing at all. <br>   <br>  Just like in humans obesity can contribute to lack of exercise because of difficulty getting about, high blood pressure and an increase in many other medical conditions eg arthiritis, diabetes etc.<br>   <br>  A fat cat seems like a happy cat but usually isn't a healthy one.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	I do and his name is tigger...   he weighs 40 lbs.. ooooo  so fat|`|rSuhsKZ0aa	yes, my milo weighs 35lbs and lays on the bed and only gets up to eat or go to the litter box. this is highlt unhealthy, but common. i am trying a new method now. putting them on a leash. it looks funny, but if you walk them around a bit they lose a LOT of weight!
oMmBhWK4aa	Most tank lighting these days are fluorescent tubes, there's no reason at all to use incandescent bulbs which heat up too much and provide the wrong light spectrum anyway. If you don't have any live plants, you don't need any strong lighting and can get by with a 15W or less tube. Use an auto timer switch to control tank lighting for 8-10 hours during daylight hours, you only need longer for plants. <br>  <br>  There are some measures to control heat. If your tank cover has removable flaps separate from the lighting unit, take those off. Too bad if the whole thing is one piece. Don't fill water all the way, so the surface doesn't heat up so much. For a more permanent solution, clip a small fan at the side and angle the fan's flow across the water surface. This increases the evaporation rate which helps to cool water by about 2-4C less than ambient (room) temperature, but you may need to top up water more frequently as the water level drops. You can also use an auto timer to switch the fan on only when the tank lighting is on. Most of such fans are based on the same fans used in PC cases and don't consume much electricity. And you'll really need some form of cooling when hot weather comes in summer.<br>  <br>  For guppies, they do best in temps of 70-77F, so 85 is too high. Even for tropical fish, you shouldn't let the temp get beyond 81F as oxygen deprivation is the biggest problem. Use an airstone & air pump if you notice your fish constantly swimming at the surface gasping for air, also do a water change.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	There's pretty much no way to have the lights not heat the tank, even a lower wattage will still heat it, just not as much.  You can switch to 15 watt bulbs instead, the heat rise will be smaller, but it will still rise.  Instead, you may have to manually adjust the heater when you want the lights on or off.<br>  Having their temp up to about 82-84 is ok, 86 isn;t super bad but it's not great.  The heat makes less oxygen in the water, making it harder to breath.  Either stock lightly or add a bubbler.  It also increases their metabolism, so keep them happily fed!<br>  Best of Luck!|`|YnCUyvK7aa	Is your light a long skinny tube [fluorescent] or 1 or 2 smaller tubes that you screw into sockets [incandescent]?  If it's the last kind you should be able to see a wire filament inside the tube.<br>  <br>  The incandescent lights produce a lot of heat.  But if you look in pet stores, and maybe even some lighting store, you can find compact fluorescent bulbs that will work in the same hood, but not produce the same amount of heat.  Find 1 that says natural daylight if you get them from a lighting store.  And you want bulbs that are long U shapes, not the spirals that you get for lights in your house.  They look like this.  <a href="http://www.tricker.com/prod-p-minicompact" rel="nofollow">http://www.tricker.com/prod-p-minicompac...</a>  Try not to get the Coralife 50/50 [it will be too blue, it's for saltwater tanks] or the Colormax [looks too pink].  <br>  <br>  If you have WalMart around where you live, there's 1 in their pet department that's about $5.  <br>  <br>  If you can't find these, see if you can exchange your incandescent hood for a fluorescent 1.  It will probably cost a little more though.<br>  <br>  If what you have is a fluorescent, make sure there's plenty of room above the hood for heat to escape.  If it's too close to the bottom of the shelf above the tank, the heat might be getting trapped.  Or try propping up the front corners so the heat escapes from the from of the light.|`|6FBpafUYaa	From what you are describing your using Incandescent lighting. These have a bad tendency to heat the water up as you have already found out. I would suggest getting a fluorescent light. These are available at all pet stores, good and bad. If your wanting to try your hand at live plants as well there are light set ups for 10 gallon tanks that produce a significant amount of light, if not don't worry about them for now. As a bit of information lights should be on for about 10 hours, but you can adjust that to suit your needs.|`|TmOQlvtHaa	I have a fish tank too, but usually, I turn off the light at night so it won't get ... shocked. Is that what you're looking for? :D
DrqNnjEDaa	Option 1:<br>  Gradually move the tray closer to the door (moving it a few inches per day). She will get used to it and wont be confused as to where it is!<br>  Option 2 (not as easy, but quicker): Watch you cat very carefully, make sure you know how often she 'relieves herself' and make sure you are near her then.<br>  At the time when she is going to do it, pick her up and put her in the litter tray *outside*. Eventually she will learn and she will just go outside.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you!|`|AA11451457	Hi - my 2 have the tray overnight (theyre locked in the kitchen for nightime) but they rarely use it and now go outside. I remember I put the tray outside while they were outside, so they got used to using the toilet with the wind about their bums (so to speak!) and after a week or so, stopped putting the tray out and they just went to the loo by themselves :) Good luck! Hate clearing out the tray lol xx|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Here is an IDEA: be a responsible cat owner...what about your neighbors garden, would you like it if a cat did there business where you grow your tomatoes?  really just keep your cat indoors where it is safe from harm and disease it will live longer and healthier!|`|vXZSluiOaa	Put the litter box outside. Eventually take it away|`|zu7XkfQ9aa	My cat is litter trained and outside trained when it is really cold outside i leave my cat inside and sometimes she bothers me and starts whining so i let her outside i leave her outside. On a school day in the morning since i have to get up at like 5:00 a.m. i put her out like really early and leave her out there until i get home because she is usually ready to come in when i get home.|`|p7QJqTwzaa	Try moving the tray a bit closer to the door each day|`|R7mnEUOZaa	Move the litter tray nearer to the door each day and she will soon get used to the idea.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, your kitten feel more secure being indoor then outdoor.  I would put it back where it is.. the spot you have the litter tray before have his territorial scent for now.
lvMLxFSkaa	Not all kitties do this.<br>  <br>  It's possible your cat may be in heat (no, really... I had a 6-month old kitten do exactly that, and she got out of the house and a month later had kittens, but that's another story).<br>  <br>  It could be that your kitties are part Siamese, and Siamese cats will wander around the house meowing to themselves all night long (I have one, now, that does this.  I ignore him.)<br>  <br>  Do your kitty's meows seem urgent?  Do the meows vary in tone or quality?  If they are strident and unchanging, it may be that her heat cycle has come on.  <br>  <br>  I wish you good luck; it's often tricky figuring out what the hell our cats want!|`|l0ERnzXmaa	well,you should not punish her but try to give her treats when she comes to you purring.I know how disturbing they can be at night.However,you should consult a cat therapist to solve the problem with a full diagnosis|`|CWdwSAV3aa	I have a cat too but your cat just wants more attention and maybe shes lonely when u put her down so at night you should let her sleep with you u bet she will love that.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Kittens always do this. It is just temporary and will stop.|`|EPnWo98Gaa	I honestly believe that your kitten is in heat. Females can go inheat from as early as 4 months and usually around six months. Be careful, too. New female kittens can actually already be pregnant. Some cats cry when they are in heat, scared (new surroundings), cant find the litter box, over hungry, looking for water dish, calling for her other female friend if she can't find her, and possibly when in labor. <br>  My two suggestions: in heat or calling for the other cat, or one she lost when you got her. <br>  DONT LET HER OUT, she WILL come back pregnant!|`|d6kekKgeaa	if its a deep moarnfull like howl, it could be a first heat, but she is kinda young, so she may just be board and trying to find attention. if it's boardom, playing with her is re-enforcing that this will get her attention. try saying her name sternly, but not harshly, this works with mine. locking her outta the room makes sence in a humman way, but the cat probably dosn't get why she's been exsiled. try to ignor it for a couple nights and see if this changes her ways. good lluck. - oh and get them both spayed even if their indoor only cats. it's healther, they may eventualy sneek out at some point, and when they do go into heat they will sent mark things you don't want them peeing on.|`|gCdP3NJGaa	My two go through stages of calling during the night even though they were spayed yrs ago. I don't allow them in the bedrooms at night as that's when they want to play and they were waking us all up. I put the calling down to wanting some attention, one calling for the other. I just talk to whichever one it is and it stops soon enough.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behaviorist...

JAdsp3iwaa	I have 5 angelfish in one of my tanks, and when I first started the tank I went through about 9 angelfish total because they would keep dying. The ones that died are the ones that'd swim only near the surface of the water, neglecting food, and not swimming with the other (very active) angelfish. A sales rep at a local aquarium place told me that after the angelfish are shipped, then acclimated to their water, then taken home and acclimated to your water, its too much stress for the angelfish to handle in a short period of time. Thus, the behavioral problems you're seeing.|`|zBioLZ9Saa	have you treated your tank with ammonia neutralizers and stuff like that?|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	It may just be getting adjusted to the aquarium, but be sure that your water params are good. Test for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. Adding ammonia neutralizers does not remove the ammonia, it just makes it less toxic. If you have any more than 0ppm of ammonia, you need to do some partial water changes with a gravel vac until you can maintain a 0ppm level.|`|WBopwqTGaa	sounds like stress try testing your water for ph nitrite and others<br>  also try starving for 24 hours and see if he/she eats after that.<br>  could be its eatng when your back is turned.<br>  angel fish are very delicate so just give it time to settle in
pW0jU9gUaa	Frequent water changes will be the best option (15-25% a week).  You can also decrease your bioload.  To decrease nitrites you could add more biological filtration (ie, live rock and sand), but this will cause an increase in nitrates, which are less toxic.  However, the only way to get rid of nitrates is frequent water changes.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	do you have live rock? you shouldnt show any nitrite after the first cycle
4111023e49140161c273538739968483aa	Eagle Pack is actually a better quality food than Blue Buffalo.  BUT in this case they are both full of grains,  Blue Buffalo being the more grain heavy of the two.  Grains can = excessive gas in many dogs.  Personally I would try a grainless food...EVO, Wellness Core, and even Blue Buffalo makes a grainless now that is less expensive than the others.  It is healthier overall and the added bonus of less or no gas!  Good luck : )|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I had my boxer mix on blue buffalo for awhile and she didn't have any excessive gas problems. She did shed quite a bit though.

zKyy1gE2aa	They can sense that you're pregnant. Do you notice that your big Husky is gentle with the little Pom/Chi? It's because the Husky knows the dog is smaller than him/her and knows to be gentle. If they are sensing you're pregnant (which is probably the case) they are just being gentle with you for that reason.<br>  On the other hand, if you notice other mood changes, you may want to take them to the vet, just as a precautionary.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	They are probably responding to you.  Since you sleep more, they sleep more.  I know there are nights where I am just beat after work so I just relax - my dog just sleeps then.  The nights where I am more active, he is more active.  Try taking more walks, it would be good for all of you!|`|RehgySLCaa	I don't know how your dogs got aids, but dogs are naturally pretty lazy during the day unless they're ready to play|`|PNT7J0Ufaa	Try taking them on a walk first thing in the morning, it will be good for both of you! and wake you all up.|`|ZtFyRwyKaa	While your dogs can certainly sense a change in you, I'm not sure they would understand that you're pregnant, specifically.  As for being tired, canines in general produce an overage of melatonin which causes them to sleep seemingly all the time.  On the other hand, they are also prone to exert enormous amounts of energy in short bursts, like when you return from an errand or something.  Perhaps they're sticking closer to you because you're PG or maybe it's because of the winter weather.

ZGfcM9wLaa	The best thing to feed them is algae discs. That's actually all you are supposed to feed them (well algae that is). I am very experienced in the fish department and I have several myself. It only takes one algae disc once or twice a day and they do grow pretty fast.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	algae wafers, sinking catfish food, blanched brocolli, cucumber. These foods won't hurt your other fish but don't leave "greens" in for more than a day or 2 in case they pollute the tank. Take them out and put fresh food in a couple of days later. My Plec is nearly 10 inches long, bought it as a 2 inch baby nearly 4 years ago|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Cucumber is a good supplement, but you should get some algae wafers for pleco's. It is best to feed after you turn the lights out as they usually eat best at night. Do not rely on the algae in the tank to feed him, there will not be enough to fill him. <br>  <br>  Also, be prepared to get a larger aquarium soon. This fish, depending upon the type of pleco, will either be 6 inches or 2ft long. He needs to be put into a much larger tank very soon.|`|4gjPQFBDaa	There are 3 types of food you can feed him as follows;<br>  <br>  Natural food; This would be algae or other things that grow in their in the aquarium where they live. If your pleco is eating algae as it’s main food source, then it’s quite possible to "cultivate algae" in a tank somewhere. Place a tank with a couple of goldfish, guppies or similar under a bright light or in a sunny position, and put a few fist-sized stones or small pieces of driftwood in the tank. As the goldfish fertilizes the water, the algae will grow nicely on all surfaces. Once the stones/wood are covered with algae, they can be moved to the tank where the plecos live. <br>  <br>  Home-made food; This group contains food that you prepare at home, that you can buy in any supermarket. <br>  <br>  Prepared food; Food that you can buy in the local fish shop, granules, tablets or wafers that are suitable for these fish. <br>  <br>  Also, almost any vegetable and fruit that you can find in the supermarket will do for feeding including oranges, but vegetables such as cucumber, courgette & melon are all excellent foods. <br>  <br>  Other commonly used food is Sweet Potatoes or Yams, split peas and sugar-snap/mange-tout. They also love broccoli and cabbage (can make the water smell like of cabbage).<br>  <br>  BUT most vegetables tend to float at the top of the tank, and plecos tend to eat at the bottom or side of the tank, so make sure the food ends up in a place where he will be able to eat it easily (using weights etc) and remove any uneaten food after 24 hours!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|1YaCGJfyaa	They love cucumber my plec is 14" long and just cant get enough of it you can also buy plec food, i.e. algae wafers in any good aquatic center...! (you may have to tie a small weight to the cucumber as it tends to float)<br>  re: no it wont hurt your other fish but if at first it doesn't take to it believe me it soon will but also remember to discard any uneaten food daily and replace with fresh, good luck..!|`|3ZOPNdxOaa	algae flakes <br>  cucumber but need something to weigh it down because it floats|`|dE8edvGIaa	You can buy plecowafers from any fish store. <a href="http://www.aquatastic.co.uk/shop/images/TetraPlecowafers.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquatastic.co.uk/shop/images/...</a> feed it one or two wafers a day. <br>  they also love zuchini and cucumber, anything green and sinking. hope it helped. x|`|ExlBKnRGaa	Cucumber.

oGVWdnHraa	I dont know about where to find one, but you dont want kangaroos at a kids party, or any party for that matter. They are pretty unpredictable, even the best trained ones kick, and the kicking hurts. Over the years of evolution, kangaroos have developed a strong hide on their bellies because when they fight, they kick each other in the belly. So I would stick with Koalas, though they do scratch and bite, they are easier to control than kangaroos :)
IrdZKYT3aa	The bubbles are a bubble nest, no worries, they do this when they're happy and healthy!  This is were the male would place the eggs from his mating.<br>  As for housing him with others, it's a toss up.  Some males are fine and other just snap and refuse to live with others.  Good tank mates are rasbora, platy, killies and pretty much any tropical community bottom feeder.<br>  Bad tank mates include guppy, gourami, tetra, danio, barbs and of course other betta.  Guppy b/c of their long colorful fins. Gourmai and betta b/c of the close relation, they will attack one another.  Tetra and barbs as well as danio are known fin nippers and may harm the slower moving betta male.<br>  But cory cats, otto cats, snails, shrimp and pleco (make sure it's a dwarf breed) are all fantastic betta boy tank mates.<br>  Housing size depends on how many fish you intend to put him with.  Crowding him is a sure fire way to make him strick out, so make sure everyone has planty of room.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Never put 2 bettas together. Your bettas puffs up at the mirror and flares at it making him look bigger, he is not admiring himself. He looks like he's admiring himself but it's called "flaring". He looks cool because he's trying to scare the other betta away (mirror image). If the tank is big enough, good tankmates are platies, mollies, shrimp, loaches, small catfish and the african dwarf frog. The bubbles on top of the water is called a "bubblenest", it just means he's happy, nothing to worry about.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	You can put other fish w/ him, but don't put another Betta (male or female) in w/ him. He may seem unaggressive, but in due time, he will show it. It's their nature. Many pet stores have one Beta in 10 gallon tanks w/ fish like guppies, tetras, sharks (tiny), mollies, platies & other fish. Yes, a ploctostomus would be good. So would a loach probably. You would best be advised by a petstore employee the best fish it may get along with. Try PetSmart, they are very informative & helpful. <br>  Cichlids are very aggressive, so that may not work. <br>  <br>  The bubbles are for a female to lay her eggs if she can stay alive long enough. lol|`|PH1eFiqwaa	You can not put a betta in a tank with another betta.  Not even a male and female until you are ready to breed them, and them after they breed you have to separate them immediately.  I have seen them in tanks with other fish, but not often.  A pletcostomus would be ok in the tank.  The bubbles mean that you have a male betta and he builds the nest and that is what you are seeing.  It means he is ready to mate and is building a nest in hopes of a female.|`|Wwry0QIlaa	I have a betta too and I don't think mine is aggressive either but I don't think I would risk putting in other fish just because the company of other fish might trigger aggressiveness.  Also, the bubble thing happens to me too and I was wondering what that is!!|`|fMiLQnSJaa	I had a betta in an aquarium that had mollies, sword tails, platys, dannios, and gouramis in it and they all along well.   just dont add another betta in there.|`|Db8vBselaa	Don't put him in with other fish! Bad idea, believe me! Juss because he didn't go crazy when he saw the mirror means he knows what glass is...and didn't want to swim into it! But bettas are extremely aggressive and he'll kill any others you put with him.<br>  The bubbles are a nest, that juss means he wants to breed (but don't try that! it never works) and they do that sometimes.<br>  jules|`|FAjAzd7zaa	I think betas should be alone, because they are tank dominant and kill each other. Which eliminates the need for all other fish you listed below.

They will become affectionate.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	They can become tame if thats what you mean. They will come when you call them because you feed and look after them, mainly they will come to you for food. <br>  <br>  They won't be your "friend" like a human is your friend.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, they can become your friends.  Indian Runners, Muscovy's, and Mallards can be friendly.   If you give them lots of love and attention, you will have a true friend.  Most friendly of all is the graylag goose.  I read a book recently that told the story of a man who kept graylag geese and how he felt as close to them as he did his dogs.  I feed the ducks and geese at my local pond on a regular basis, and some of the graylag geese let me pet them.  They are so sweet.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Sure, especially young ducks. Throw them some chicken scratch feed and call them. they will come and get more friendly every time you feed them.|`|RxeQJcqhaa	I love ducks.|`|UofhMpy9aa	cool
FoeyqAZqaa	Because many people see pits as dangerous and do not want to adopt them. And pits make up 35-50% of most shelters. So you do see more pits being killed then other dogs. It is very cruel, but without euthanasia, there would be so many more dogs without homes and there would be nothing to do with them. They would be running the streets.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	ok first of all i'd like to address Norbert P's comment by saying that pit bulls are not any more dangerous than any other breed who is left in the hands of a bad owner. every dog has the potential to be a vicious/ dangerous dog if trained or abused to be that way. pit bulls are put to sleep mostly because bad owners have trained them to be attack dogs or for dog fights, which causes the shelter to have to classify them as unadoptable. it's not the shelter's fault. they have to worry about the liability issues and legal issues of adopting out any dog. if a dog is known to be aggressive (no matter what the breed) they can not adopt it out because they risk a law suit, and then the closure of the shelter. due to people allowing dogs to breed at a ridiculous rate, shelters have no choice but to euthanize to make room for other dogs who need to be taken in. <br>  i dont understand what you mean about making them die slowly. they use euthanasia just the same on any dog and it is painless and quick. the real issue is irresponsible owners.|`|ENaEvmNmaa	I don't think they are made to die anymore slowly than any other breed and by law they have to be held as long as any other breed.The exception is one who has bitten someone and they are put down at the request of the owner.<br>  I do think it is a sad shame that so many are deemed "unadoptable"<br>  because of the way they have been treated.I have an aging APBT and an almost 3 year old Amstaff and I could never ask for any dog to be any better than these two dogs are.<br>  Its a shame more people don't get to know these breeds before selling them out as "vicious".|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Our County animal shelter gets predominantly two breeds: pit bulls and chihuahuas.  They get very few other breeds.  The reality is that not many people want to adopt them and they get a lot that have been fought or are aggressive because who owned them.  So they screen the pits very carefully.  Only the ones that pass the behavioral and health tests with flying colors get put up for adoption.  Which is a select few.<br>  <br>  Don't blame the shelters - blame the jerks that selectively breed them for aggression (or just let them breed randomly because they don't spay and neuter their dogs) and then screw them up by trying to make them tough or by fighting them.|`|TYuJV8HJaa	They have a high reputation of attacking small children/ various individuals. Alot of society sees them as monsters to be truthful. They think that pits are an evil breed and highly deadly. Honestly it's all up to the owners how the pits act. Especially if they have been fought then people think that they can not be rehabilitated to be a house pet.<br>  <br>  And its definitely not right to single out this breed.|`|0TghwMJqaa	I have never heard of this before, but i do know in my province it is against the law to have a pitt bull and i'm sure they are often euthanized at the pound and what not.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine works as animal control and they found a litter of pitt bulls that weren't legal and they were told to euthanize the 10 pups.<br>  Instead, they flew them out to a shelter in a different province where they're not illegal and where they were adopted out. a happy ending.<br>  <br>  They also have bad names because of the idiot skids who take these animals and make them vicious to protect their drugs and whatever else they're doing illegal. <br>  Skids take the dogs bad side (that every dog has) and they  empathize it in the dog... it's quite disgusting if you ask me.<br>  <br>  Again.. 99% of the time.. it's the owners fault! <br>  in my opinion anyway.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	The shelter by me will NOT adopt out chows, pits or rots.  It is on their website if they are surrendered they are euthanized.|`|Qiw9AFkaaa	because humans don't know how to control them and raise them properly; it is not the breeds fault but our own|`|AA11564934	1st ones to get killed where?

My argument to the whole case is that even though Pitbulls are the dog of choice for dog fighters, once we kill them off, they'll start using little poodles or some other breed to dogfight. And it's not just Pitbulls, it's also the other "bully" breeds like rottweilers and dobermans. I think it's immoral and disgusting and that it's the owners fault for choosing to fight the dog.|`|V5Ib9BCsaa	pits are so over bred right now. everyone feels the need to breed there pit and bring a bunch of puppies in the world and no one to take care of them. shelters get so many of these dogs and cant possibly take care of them all and most people wont adopt a pit. the media has tainted there reputation, saying that they are evil man eating monsters. which couldnt be further from the truth. even when fought it was frowned upon to have a human aggressive pitbull. they would stand in the ring so the dog could see them, because allthe pit wanted to do was please its owner. if there dog was about to loose they would often snatch there dog up and leave. the ones fought were often family pets too. they have never been bred to be human aggressive. now a days alot of people get them because they look mean and tough and try to make them mean a tough, then cant keep a handle on there dog and makes it hard to own the breed for the rest of us responsible owners. they actually pass there temperament test with an 85% which is in the top 95% of all the dogs tested. they score higher than cocker spaniels, german sheperds, and labs.. (im not saying any of them are bad dogs, im jsut making a point that pits arent viscious) here is a link to a video id like you to watch its only like 3 min long and its very informative on how the breed is treated as a whole. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeuy_PBlqz8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeuy_PBlq...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://s370.photobucket.com/albums... target="_blank"><img src="http://i370.photobucket.com/albums/... border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Because there are so many of them in shelters, and so few adopters for them.  Humane euthanasia is not a slow process, but quick & painless.  Unfortunately not all big city & rural shelters have funding for vet care & euthanasia, and gas chambers are still in use.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	first ones to get killed? i dont know what you mean.

Z9zzNYNCaa	Answering again...the 694th time....NO,I'm not an ignorant cowardly bigot.I don't fall for fairy-tales about anything.<br>  *I* know that no breed is "vicious".|`|1nrELmHbaa	An animal is an animal, period.  You cannot accurately predict an animal's behavior.  They can be trained to be vicious and they can also be raised to be loving members of your family.  The issue for me is the strength of the dog you are referring to.  You never know when or if a dog with an already short temper (as has repeatedly been said of a pit bull) is going to decide it has put up with enough and lash out.  Sure, a poodle or chihuahua can get ticked off too, but they are not going to cause serious damage and maul or kill someone.  I'm sorry, I would never own a pit bull!  They are too unpredictable and too dangerous and I would not take the chance of one hurting my child, my animals, or myself.  The American Kennel Club refuses to even recognize them as a breed (mainly because there has been no established pure blood line), so that alone tells me something. My advice:  Don't take the chance.  If you want a big dog, get a lab or golden retriever or some other breed of dog that doesn't have temperament issues to begin with.|`|vyfrNxeOaa	No, i think some dogs are more prone  to have  a bad temperament than others,but i mostly believe people are to blame for all the bad press they have.<br>  i'm used to get bad looks from people when i tell them i have a doberman,because i have a 6 years old but he is very good with everyone and every other pet,still i never leave him alone with children, even if i need the toilet and the dog is rooming free in the house with my son there  i will put him in the kitchen .Its common sense|`|ePheyIF8aa	no, not by nature.

It's  the morons who get these dogs and try to make them into guard dogs by abusing/chaining/ them that causes the problem and rep of them being vicious.|`|T9Yce0bcaa	pittbulls are known to be one of the most loyal breeds(if raised properly) they have the capacity to be vicious but shoudlnt be unless threatened or raised to be so.|`|cad9a8250594b1c2ab41bd2c31b12304aa	They are more prone to attacking than other breeds like the pug.<br>  <br>  But sometimes people like to create a status level and scare other people.<br>  <br>  And sometimes the dogs get 2 playful and bite instead of nip.<br>  <br>  But its mostly down 2 training & Handling|`|AA11992723	i think all breeds and mutts can be vicious, but none are vicious as a whole breed<br>  <br>  i think it's a terrible crime how the media has wrongly influenced peoples hatred and fear of APBT and any dog that looks like a pit.|`|AA10229248	ANY dog that has been mistreated or feels threatened is vicious.

0m6BgESXaa	Your brother and husband aren't threats to the dog because he has been around them.  They are predictable entities and thus nothing to be afraid of.<br>  <br>  One thing you MUST do is absolutely STOP your uncle from yelling at the dog.  The dog has no idea he's kidding...that is a human concept.  He's only making the issue worse for you to deal with and placing further mistrust in the dog.<br>  <br>  New people are scary to him because they are unpredictable.  He doesn't know what they may or may not do to him, and thus they cannot be trusted in his eyes.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to have a male friend over...someone with "presence" that is calm, relaxed, and will show little fear towards the dog (preferably none at all).  Just have a quiet conversation with the person while the dog is around, and give the man a TON of awesome cookies.  I don't mean milk bones, but high value items like pieces of left over steak, hot dogs, string cheese, etc.  It makes it more worthwhile for the dog to come closer.<br>  <br>  When he approaches your male friend, have him do nothing.  He shouldn't even move for a moment and his back should remain turned to the dog (he is less threatening this way).  As the dog approaches praise him in low, quiet, slow tones. "Good boy.  That's very good."  You can make your voice sound happy even when you're speaking quietly.<br>  <br>  As you praise the dog, have your friend with his back turned turn his hand to face the dog so the dog can have the cookie.  He may or may not take it...if he does, you're already on your way!<br>  <br>  Allow him to do this for a few minutes.  He should eventually come back more and more frequently.  Do this over the course of many weeks (and overall this may take months or even a couple of years) with several men.<br>  <br>  Slowly you will work towards these men turning to face the dog, but with their eyes averted to the ground.  Have them stare at their shoes and offer the dog a cookie.  Them avoiding eye contact is a signal of "I'm not here to hurt you.  I don't want confrontation."<br>  <br>  The body posture should be relaxed and nonthreatening.  The dog may even start to offer behaviors such as a sit in order to get food faster.<br>  <br>  Eventually have the men start raising their heads and smiling at the dog.  A smile is an invitation.  Dogs are about body language.  There are people that can make their animals sit and lie down with no more than facial expressions.  I know of one woman with a dog that used nothing but her face for a drop on recall.  When she smiled, the dog would come to her, when she frowned he would lay down.<br>  <br>  Do not allow the men to tower over your dog.  They need to remain as straight as possible while they offer food.  If they lean over the dog takes it as a sign of dominance, and seeing as he's rather submissive, this could set him back.<br>  <br>  He may never actually learn to LIKE men, but he can at least learn to tolerate them.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	they where raised around him thats why he is scared the best thing u can do is have some guy friends come over day after day and see if hell start to adapt to guys|`|1nrELmHbaa	Pit bulls are temperamental animals to begin with, and will react as such.  Your uncle for one should be told not to yell at the dog!  The dog is reacting from fear and intimidation.  The hair standing up your dog's back should tell you he is not comfortable.  When animal's are frightened, they either flee or fight.  I have a small dog that was terrified of men, from having been abused by a man before I got him.  I had a small basket hanging by the door with cut up bits of his favorite treat in it.  When someone that he was uncomfortable with came through the door, they got a few pieces of his treats out and kinda tossed them at him, and pretty much ignored the dog otherwise.  After a while, my dog would come over to them because he associated them with his "yummies" so he decided they weren't so bad afterall.  Definitely don't let anyone tease him!  If anyone cannot agree to treat the dog with respect (and you, they are in your home) ask them to leave!  It's as simple as that.  Good luck!  I'd love to know if this little trick helps your fella!|`|EeTJ1CEHaa	So it's not "all" men, just certain ones?<br>  <br>  My American Bulldogs take a dislike to certain people as well.<br>  <br>  One of our dogs is more timid than the others and therefore would be more likely to actually bite from fear if approached and cornered.(fear is probably why your dog retreats)  Bulldogs will generally accept who you do, and are more cautious of those they fear for whatever reason. If a person "wanted" the dog to know them, they would try to earn the dogs trust & in time could do so if they were genuine.Because they are protective of you, he comes out whenever your uncle raises his voice, which only makes the situation worse. Dogs are actually pretty good judges of character. You need to make sure your dog knows who the pack leader is(that would be you) and show him you are in control, otherwise you could have serious problems.|`|IGfnrfGPaa	My Grandmother had a Dachshund that was terrified of most men. In her case she was abused by her previous owner (a man). She would warm up to Men that she was familiar with and that treated her right. We never forced her to be around men, we always made sure she had a place to retreat to if she was stressed. Your Uncle needs to stop this behavior now, he will get bit. Its not a matter of if, its a matter of when. This has nothing to do with the breed, any dog would react that way. Every time your Uncle (or new men) comes over have him give your dog a treat, with time he should become more relaxed. Just make sure your Uncle no longer yells at the dog or around the dog, and make sure the dog has somewhere to retreat to if he gets stressed.|`|ifJnA7AZaa	Well sounds like he will be like that always round strangers specially if he is a rescue dog just thing b4 you found him you dont now what happen to him (guessing sum bois must of done sumthing to him as he was younger and he remembers) as long as he is alright with fam and most other ppl just keep on top of it and hopefully in time it will pass he still young so still got much to learn plus it sounds like is got fear wich brings out the vicious site of animals when they are in a situation which they can not control|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	Your uncle may be getting a kick out of shouting at your dog but he is creating a major trust problem for your dog.  His loud voice is scaring him and it may cause him to become aggressive. He should start speaking to the dog in a more gentle tone.  He should also give him treats and coax him to eat it out of his hands so that he can learn to trust him and men again. You asked how to break the habit of taking a "stance" in the middle of the room?  Well, it's not the dog that needs to break the habit.  It's your silly uncle who needs to break the habit of shouting at the dog and he must do it immediately before the dog begins to attack people (him) out of fear.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	He just sounds like a normal Pit.  Due to so much over breeding & all the fighting going on it is hard to say what the real problem is.  In proper breeding results in bad temperaments & mental problems.  You dogs may have been from a line of dogs that were fought & the litter abandoned because of the improper breeding.  The pups may have not been what they expected & was ditched.<br>  <br>  You will probably have to get a trainer to work with you on a one on one basis.  There are things you can do to help curb this but with a Pit you need a specialist.<br>  <br>  Here are some sites that may be able to help you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=stop%20canine%20aggression">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=stop%20...</a>|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	I'd tell 'my' uncle that he is not to ever treat my dog that way.

That dog will eventually go from hackles to biting his face off if he keeps making it feel insecure like that.<br>  <br>  YOU need to get this dog out for more obedience training and a lot of it.  This dog needs to be socialized, socialized and then socialized and have a lot of positive experiences with more people.  <br>  <br>  This is not a habit for your dog.  The dog is acting this way when it feel threatened or insecure.  It's misreading situations and that misreading is due to a lack of experience.  So the more experiences the dog has, the more situations and people it's exposed to, the better it will be at reading when something is really a threat and when it's not.<br>  <br>  And seriously, don't let your uncle continue to tease the dog.  It's causing the dog a lot of stress and it is a potentially fatal situation for the dog since, based on it's breed, if it should decide to bite your uncle one day even though it's your uncle starting it, it will probably be taken away from you and put to sleep.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Your dog may sense that you get worried when a man comes to the house. He may have just been territorial the first time. That is pretty natural for most dogs. After that, he may have continued the behavior to protect you in his mind.<br>  <br>  Why not keep a small bowl of treats by the door? Post a small note asking that every man that comes to the door offer a treat to your dog. He will associate men coming to the door to be a positive thing. My dog will not accept any stranger into my house until they sit down on a chair. At that point, she must feel that I welcomed them in and she is comfortable.

If your cat has some similar features as a purebred cat which you've seen, it doesn't necessarily mean your cat is that breed. For instance, a shorthair cat that was born in America is not necessarily an American Shorthair cat. Just as not every black cat is a Bombay, and not every gray cat is a Chartreux. Also terms like calico, tortoise shell, tabby, and tuxedo are words used to describe the color and pattern; they are not breeds. <br>  <br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.|`|GdBG4PGYaa	Awwww! She is so tiny and fluffy! Aww!<br>  <br>  She is probably a mixed breed, otherwise I don't think you would have found her. That means she would be a DLH (right now, not so much, but she is fluffy). Domestic Long Hair is what you would classify a mixed breed cat as so then they can be known as one name and not a lot of different ones!<br>  <br>  If she was a breed (or if she is) she would be a Doll Faced Persian. Very cute!<br>  <br>  Her color is Tortoiseshell, because she has little white, black, brown and light brown.<br>  Calico's have to have a large amount of white, and usually have reds (orange), light browns, and a bit of black.<br>  <br>  Her overall title is Tortoiseshell Doll Faced Persian/DLH.<br>  I hope I helped! She is adorable!|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Looks like a persian mix to me, its hard to tell without a closer look.  Next time at the vets, ask, cause they are great judges of this.  She is precious!!!    : )|`|wqL84O8Naa	it looks like a torte-calico mix|`|iTZHWx5Vaa	She could be a Persian mix.  She's adorable.|`|3DBrbjyvaa	It looks like a tiny owl!<br>  very cute|`|4aAhEK9daa	Oh my goodness!  Tiny little thing.  Looks almost too young to be away from her mother.  Did you put up posters saying you found her, call the local shelters, have the vet see if she's microchipped?<br>  <br>  Unless you have papers to prove otherwise odds are she's no particular breed.  The round head, small ears and round eyes definitely indicate Persian in its background.  Could be a pedigreed Persian but "doll face" simply means not a Persian to breed standard.  Reputable breeders don't breed Persians to have "doll faces".<br>  <br>  Do you have some more pics to post of her?  And what's with her coat?  Was she wet in this pic?  <br>  <br>  edit: good call someone saying "Selkirk Rex"  The coat DOES look like a Selkirk Rex's but they're not very common at all.  Unless you have a breeder near you and a kitten escaped.  I'm thinking this kitten is just wet or dirty in this photo and it's coat isn't curly.  Here's other Selkirk Rex kittens - <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=selkirk%20rex%20kitten&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a>  I do hope you've TRIED to find this kitten's owner and I'm sure they're looking for it.
kWwgWSSgaa	One of my Dobermanns managed to keep me on my toes my developing a variety of different lumps.<br>  <br>  It could be cyst {hard lump under the skin}, wart {if the lump is on the surface of the skin} a benign tumour or fatty/gristle lump. Low grade tumours are usually curative if removed with wide margins. <br>  <br>  If after examining the lump the vet thinks its suspicious, it would be aspirated/removed & sent for analysis. That's the only way to know if its high/low grade cancer.<br>  <br>  {Boris had all of the above}<br>  <br>  Better to err on the side of caution and get the lumps checked. Try not to worry as the majority of lumps are completely harmless.<br>  <br>  Hope your dog is okay|`|Um8osMNuaa	lt could be something completely harmless like a fatty lump, my Lab had a few of these, they are common in dogs that are overweight, then again it could be something more serious, the only way to know is to see the vet.|`|IFiwmb3Haa	I would get it checked out by your vet.  As dogs get older they tend to get tumors and the such.  Could be just a cyst but I would get it checked out the next time your dog is due for shots.|`|pDv13gJwaa	VET
jhZegrqRaa	Of course she will have peed if you aren't home all day!<br>  <br>  It will be more difficult to house train your pup because you won't be with her. <br>  <br>  But for the short time that you will be with her you must make sure to take her outside to your designated spot regularly. At least every 45mins and AS SOON as she wakes from a nap and 5 minutes after feeding.<br>  <br>  Reprimanding her will do no good at all as pups don't understand what you are upset about. Don't forget she has only just left her litter-mates and will be feeling very strange.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and your pup!|`|rVsrvuEOaa	When my family was house trainingg our cocker spaniel a friend told us to tie a jingle bell to the front and back door make sure that the string is long enough so that the dog can reach it with its nose. Eventually the dog will recognize the bell ringing with going outside to go pee or poop and the dog will start to ring the bell when it needs to go outside. And during the day when you are not there put the dogs in a kennel and they will learn not to go to the bathroom in there. Hope this helps.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Um, why would you expect an 8 week old puppy to be potty trained?  They certainly don't come that way at 8 weeks and it will be weeks before the pups bladder is large enough to hold urine for more than a few hours.  <br>  <br>  Get a crate, and get the pup on a schedule where the pup is being taken outdoors every few hours.  She even needs to go out through the night right now.  She should not have the run of the house or even a room while you are not there to watch her until you're sure she's potty trained and sure she's not getting into anything in the house.<br>  <br>  This is why people say it takes WORK to raise a puppy and you need a lot of time to do it right.  Getting a small puppy when you're going to be gone all day at work is asking for trouble and asking for things like potty training and house training to take a long time.<br>  <br>  What to do?<br>  Go buy a puppy training book so your expectations of the pup will be realistic.<br>  Hire a dog walker or someone to come by during the day to let your puppy out.<br>  Or take a week off work and spend some time training the pup, then hire the dog walker.<br>  <br>  This pup is not going to train itself while you are off at work.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I'm not sure what you mean by "training her to go outside with my other dog." Do you just mean taking them out at the same time, or do they have access to an outside area when you are not around? At this point, I would HIGHLY recommend having someone, you, your husband, a neighbor you trust, a friend, a professional dogsitter/walker let the puppy out during the day. Really, you'd need someone to let her out at least twice while you are gone, but it will make housetraining MUCH easier for you and her. Akitas are clean dogs and generally get the hang of housetraining pretty easily. Even adult akitas pick it up pretty quick, but you have to be consistent! Praise her when she goes in the right place (outside), but don't punish her for going in the house. Let her out after play time, meal time, nap time, and every 1-2 hours until she is able to hold it longer. <br>  <br>  I also agree that you should not leave an adult dog and a puppy together unsupervised. It's really just asking for trouble. Not only can they fight or play too rough, it gives the puppy hours to get into things she shouldn't, which could be dangerous to her. Even if you find her soon after ingesting something inappropriate, chances are slim that you will know what it was and how much of it she got and that can be critical information in an emergency. Start crate training her now, it will come in very handy when she is an adult. You can try covering it, but some dogs, and akitas in general, do not like covered crates.  <br>  <br>  Email me privately and I can give you the address of a great akita forum where you can get advice/tips and good discussion from very experienced owners. BTW, where did you get your puppy?|`|iVQULHqYaa	How on earth could anyone ever expect to buy  an eight week puppy which is house trained? How can anyone be so unfeeling  and  leave a puppy all day. She has just left her mother and her litter mates, consequently she will be frightened. This puppy should be fed four times a day, someone should be with her to do that and to house train her.<br>  <br>  Your dog will be miserable and with your total lack of knowledge she will be come an unmanageable aggressive uncontrollable hooligan.<br>  <br>  Your question was "what  should I do" Get her rescued while she is still a puppy.|`|9kTejB0uaa	At 8 weeks, apart from perhaps knowing to go on newspaper if the litter was reared with newspaper up one end of the whelping box, of course she's not house trained!!!!!  Good heavens, what are you expecting?  She doesn't know you, where she is or what's going to happen to her next.  She doesn't know anything yet!  She will be upset, tired and missing her old life.  Cut her some slack.<br>  <br>  You start from day 1 with housetraining.  And actually it's a better idea to take your puppy outside on her own at this point, so she concentrates on what you are asking of her, rather than following the other dog.  You take her out as soon as the wakes from a sleep, about 10 minutes after being fed, after a short period of play (you will get to recognise the 'absent' look and the circling) and roughly every hour besides.  <br>  <br>  You get a crate too - which will protect your floors!  The crate is used as a den, cover the top and three sides and have it in a quiet place, near to where you are.  <br>  <br>  I have to be honest here and suggest that if you are working full time, you are going to find it extremely difficult to get on top of housetraining fast.  Of course, at 8 weeks, a puppy can't hold for longer than say 2 hours, tops.  You have taken in a baby, and it's going to take time, patience, and consistency.  If you have been through this already with your other dog, don't you already know this?<br>  <br>  PS  It's not a good idea either to leave these two together yet.  Your older dog won't appreciate being mugged by a puppy (once she finds her feet).  Yes, you can have them in the same room, if the puppy is crated, but don't leave them alone unsupervised, yet or your Pug could end up being pushed too far, and that spells trouble.
EeTJ1CEHaa	Both methods contain insecticides which are "not good" for animals. However, it's a choice of the lesser evil. My Son's dog was diagnosed with heart worms when he had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. Some dogs do not make it through the "heart worm treatment" it is "VERY" hard on them. For people who don't want that treatment, but also don't want their dogs heart worm problem to keep growing, putting them on the heart worm preventative is an option. My vet office requires the dog to be with them all day the first time the preventative is given so that if there is a reaction and/or your dog needs immediate medical attention he is already with them. So, what the 2nd vet told you sounds pretty right on with my vets office. There is a lot of information available via blogs, etc. about people that have had experiences with both alternatives. My vet also has seen a dog come back later after just the preventative treatment and test heart worm negative. Good luck.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	It depends what test was run.  Antigen filter test?  The first stage of heart worm is called microfilia.  Treatment for this stage is heartgard or ivermectin. The heartworms are in the blood stream and have not developed in the heart. Ask your vet what stage your dog is at!|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	You've already paid for three professional decisions<br>  Now you want OURs?<br>  <br>  You've taken advantage of yourself by second, third and fourth guessing the professionals.<br>  At some point you are going to have to trust some vet.  Or you're putting your dog at risk|`|qapJU3tMaa	You cannot treat a dog with heart worm meds if it has heart worms.  Your dog can be tested for heart worms.  Go see a canine internal medicine vet.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Both vets were basically right, the first vet is just more aggressive.<br>  Heartgard is a preventative and I am leary of using it as a treatment, but it can be done, IF its a small infection of adult worms. The treatment and preventive are both poisons. The treatment is extremely hard on the dog. That is why the correct dose is so important. IMPO I would have the dog retested in 6 months instead of a year.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Giving heartgard to a dog with a high amount of heartworms can kill the dog, but it is common practice to use the ivermectin in heartgard to kill off a very small amount of heartworms. The trick is knowing how bad the heartworm infection is before determining how it will be treated.....your previous vet was kind of right in saying that you don't just give heartgard without knowing exactly what you are dealing with, but your second vet gave you sound advice.
XBXjeaYGaa	They will never understand a full conversation, but they can learn certain phrases.  For instance, my dogs know what "bye-bye", "going out" and "leave it" means as well as basic commands.  I do believe they can be a great companion when you are sad, or happy.  I think they can tell when   you are sad and feel with you sometimes.  I had a dog when I was growing up that would just sit his little chin on my leg and let me cry if I needed it.|`|AA10029366	So...you're saying that would be cool?|`|dqzoEw67aa	You can't really talk to him, but over time they begin to understand many words if you're with them a lot and talk when you do things.  So try to say a word, the same word, whenever you do something with him.  Like when you feed him, say Time to Eat, or walks, Walk time, etc.  Then when you say the word they know.  When I say, "Are you hungry?" to my dog, she always licks her lips, "Do you want to go for a walk?", she goes to her leash and points at it, etc. They do understand with repetition.|`|yPhCujOvaa	Since dogs can't speak, your best method of communication is body language.  Over time, he will pick up on common phrases and words.  However, you can interact with most dogs with your body alone.  For example, if you want to play, trying offering him a "play bow" (down on your knees and elbows, with your back arched).  Your dog will likely run toward you to play and may offer you the same gesture.  If you want to go out, shake the leash around.<br>  <br>  The other thing you can do is increase his vocabulary by doing lots of tricks and verbal games.  I've got a Beagle and I've been teaching her to find toys by name.  So, I'll say "Find Snoopy" or "Find Woodstock" and she gets that toy.  Once your dog is used to your voice, he will pick up on your words faster.  However, dogs are not capable of the same reasoning, logic or thought process that we are, so you will never be able to communicate with a dog the way you can with a human, obviously.<br>  <br>  I don't really know how else to answer this because you weren't too specific.  What, specifically, do you want to communicate with your dog?|`|sQOXjKFNaa	You can try several lauguages to see if he understand them.  If that doesnt work, try woof, woof.|`|IowG78BGaa	well its a dog, you cant really communicate, hun.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	Dogs can't talk.
AA11359147	As far as the ferret goes, a mixture of two different ferret foods and IAMS kitten chow is a great diet for you ferret. The kitten food is high in protein, which a ferret needs. As far as the cat goes, a few pieces of ferret kibble now and again will not hurt the cat. I know from experience because I own both cats and ferrets. As long as you do not give the cat too much, it will be fine.|`|wtoTRtEPaa	its to high in protien for a cat it will take them much longer to burn off the extra weight.<br>  <br>  which is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  as for ferrets PLEASE do not feed them cat food. while people who dont know better tell you its ok to feed them cat food its not. <br>  <br>  cats eat lower protien based foods than ferrets.<br>  ferrets need alot of Animal protien cat food is only good during a pinch when the store is out of stock or you have to choose between the bag of ferret food and your electric bill.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Ferrets should NOT eat kitten food, at least not as the main part of their diet. A few pieces of kitten food won't hurt a ferret, but it doesn't have enough protein and fat for their needs. And a cat shouldn't eat ferret food because the cat will gain too much weight.
a9388aa832e1b42ed43cb15b336d3cbcaa	Repetition, I found that returning my bunny to his litter box multiple times and praising him when he used it worked really well. He still had a few accidents when he got excited (but lets face it pellets are so much easier to clean up lol!) The other thing you have to consider when allowing a bunny to run loose in the house is their chewing. Make sure all wires are wrapped ( use pvc pipe or something similar, not tape!) and secured so they can't be chewed on! (and anything else you don't want chewed up!)<br>  <br>  (side note, I really like the type of cage with the slide out bottom for my little guy, it was easy to clean, which was good cause it got stinky fast!)|`|ZU7nz2N5aa	Praise him/her everytime they use the litterbox. Use pellets or treats as rewards. Scold him/her when they use the floor, the rabbit will so learn. Mine did.
9kceDOTraa	In almost every case, in fact I cannot think of any exceptions, bigger is better, and at a difference of only 50.00 you might just as well get the 180.  The fact of the matter is, while both a 150 and 180 is the same length, you get more width in a 180, and width is an important aspect to consider with any fish you keep.  It's a bit foolish not to consider extra width I think, not geared at your input but rather another answer.<br>  <br>  As far as freshwater or salt, Andrew brings out a great point.  Salt water fish have the most beautiful colors to them I think and I do have a 180 African freshwater set up among my other tanks, but they cannot compare to the colors Salt water fish have.  However, getting live rock or coral, the proper lighting to sustain it, sand, and having to get the proper salinity, it is more work and quite a bit more money to run a Salt water set up.  Ideally then I'd say, with respect to your wallet, go freshwater, especially as well if you are bringing up prices.<br>  <br>  What to put in the 180?  Wow I mean you really have a whole world of options.  You could build up a whole world of schooling fish in a tank like that.  Most standard 180s like mine are 72 x 24 x 24 and you could put in about 5-6 groups of different schooling fish in proper schooling numbers, and build up a community of bottom feeders as well.<br>  <br>  You as well are open to almost every kind of cichlid out there as well.  Some actually would get too big for your tank, such as the Emperor cichlid of Tangyangika, but most could work.  I have a mix of Haps, Mbuna, and Peacocks in my 180 with a pretty good range of colors and aggression, and as well I have a Malaysian Golden Jardini in with them.  Not the normal mix that's for sure.<br>  <br>  You could go with a heavily planted tank, or you could go with sand, so many different choices.  Being you have a goldfish tank, I'm not sure what would interest you.  If you want something flashy, go schooling fish with large numbers of species, if you are looking for something more exotic and usual, look into African cichlids, if you are looking for larger sized fish, maybe South or Central American cichlids are your way to go.  If you are looking into expensive fish, or rare hard to find types, Victorian or Madagascar African cichlids are your ticket.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	There isn't much of advantage over 150 gallon. This is not like comapring 20 gallon with a 55.<br>  <br>  Pick the one you like and that suit your price. If this is intended for saltwater tank, remember that you will changing 20% of the water at least every 2 weeks. And that will cost you in the salt mixes. So keep that in mind when you decide. <br>  <br>  If one is reef ready, get that one over the one that isn't. Reef ready tanks are simply the ones that have built drilled holes for the over flow.<br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	i would get the one 180, <br>  <br>  and you should probably stick with fresh water, salt water is for people hell bent on going saltwater, but that said a 180 gal would make one sweet reef tank|`|RT8LZy7gaa	From personal experience with an 80 gallon salt water tank, they're beautiful but very hard to get right.  Plus you have to have the saltwater mixed for water changes and we had to keep gallons of it premixed on shelves. One bottle springing a leak and our carpet got soaked!<br>  <br>  For those prices, I'd go for the 180 gallon and make a beautiful planted aquarium. You can put in your established tankmates but why upset they're harmony? Besides it will take awhile to cycle the tank and you don't want all your fish to die. I'd say leave the goldfish in their own tank.  <br>  <br>  You'd need an appropriate size filter (easy enough to figure out, the sizes of the aquariums are on the boxes)<br>  <br>  Lots of multilevel live plants for layering.<br>  <br>  Maybe some rocks for hiding places. you can make little caves out of flat rocks.<br>  <br>  Lots of gravel.<br>  <br>  a really good gravel vac for cleaning.<br>  <br>  A CO2 system to help the plants out if you feel really motivated. (to tell the truth, I have a CO2 cylinder and the plants look exactly the same as when I didn't have one)<br>  <br>  A bottle of aquatic plant fertilizer<br>  <br>  Some starter fish (schoolers like danios or tetras probably would be cheapest) to begin cycling the tank after a week.<br>  <br>  If you want to experiment with saltwater, switch your 10 gallon freshwater fish into the big tank once it's up and running and set up the 10 gallon as a salt water tank. That way if it fails you haven't sunk alot of cash into it and you can tell if you'll like it or not. You could get a couple clown fish, maybe an angel and an anemone with some live rock.  It would be easier to maintain (and cheaper to set up) than a 180 gallon salt water tank!|`|JAdsp3iwaa	With a deal like that, go for the 180g!! But with such an immaculate tank, it deserves something much more than goldfish! Go with a freshwater tank. It will end up costing ALOT less- and a saltwater tank that size can cost thousands! I'd say go with a fish that will grow to a good size. You dont want your tank to look empty! Oscar fish are good fish for a 180g. Oscar fish require medium-large size substrate, having 1 OR 6 is best, great tankmates are plecos, jack dempseys, convicts, ONE pacu, etc... Hope I'm some help and good luck !|`|lsO714NQaa	Bigger is better.<br>  Freshwater is easier than saltwater.<br>  you will need<br>  Substrate<br>  Filter <br>  heater<br>  decor<br>  Plants(live is better) if live co2 system<br>  Gravel vac.

And if you do the salt water you have to keep the salt balance accurately.  It's really up to you though.  Personally I would try salt water in a smaller tank, 55 gallons, and when I feel I'm ready, I'd get the huge tank.  Or use the 180 for fresh water and 55 for salt water.  Just till you get your feet wet.
oDVx7nSxaa	I'd suggest not dropping the canned food, but trying a different brand of canned.  Some less expensive alternatives (but better than the Whiskas) would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul, Nutro, and even PetSmart's Authority brand.<br>  <br>  Another option might be to check out some online retailers, where you can order a case of food at a pretty decent cost savings.  It's not cheap to feed multiple cats good food (I feed 6 - ouch!)|`|zpwJR60baa	I agree with ultrabutterfly...<br>  I also had asked my vet...<br>  <br>  there are not much difference now on expensive brand and local store brand food.  store brand food are much better then in the past, and if you look at the nutrients on the brand and store brand... they have the same nutrients...<br>  <br>  Hope this help!|`|FfSEhCARaa	If your going to drop the quality because of budget (and no one can fault you for that, thats just the way it goes) Try not to drop all the way down to whiskas or science diet or iams or something like that. It will probably save your budget to drop the quality of the wet food, because the cans tend to be more expensive in the long run, depending on how often your feeding wet of course. But again, try to drop to a mid level food (as the employees at the pet store for good brands) instead of a crap food. Buy the best quality you can with your budget|`|0ced398ce3457c59181856bd15c7a1fcaa	There is no law or rule that says you have to feed the cats wet food. It's more expensive and can give them bowel issues.  I give my 3 kitties dry food and they're prefectly fine. I leave a large bowl out all day and they'll graze and eat when they want to. A large 10lb bag costs about $10-12 and lasts with the 3 cats, about 2 weeks.|`|bSWntzDkaa	yes you can just give them hard food my cat loves hard food|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Wow, do what is best for you.  I am trying to feed two feral cats.  I put out one can of Fancy Feast (50 cents at WalMart) per day and it's first come first served for that.  But the 2 cats go through an 8 pound bag of 9 Lives cat food every 3 days ($3.68 per bag at WalMart).   I seldom see either cat because they feed at night in the garage.  I love cats and would sacrifice some of my own food to take care of them. If you figure it out I am spending about $55 per month for the food. Cats and dogs are wonderful and I wish I could resuce them all.|`|PUg4go20aa	You don't need to give your cats wet food.  Just feed it as a treat occasionally.  They will be fine on just the dry food, plus its the best to keep their teeth in good condition.
1Qh9i9cWaa	If he's only attacking one side of the tank, cover that side with a t-shirt or cloth and see if that stops him.<br>  <br>  Putting lots of plants around the tank can help break up the light and make the reflection less obvious.<br>  <br>  He should eventually stop, once he realizes those "other bettas" aren't ever going to come in and invade his home.<br>  <br>  You should be glad for all the flaring. It means he's feeling healthy and happy enough to defend his territory. Also, an occasional flare is good for the fins.

But you can get them at wal-mart during flower season for like $1.00 our Guinea Pig has yet to tip it. <br>  <br>  You could also look for something like what they put on the side of bird cages.

The bowl is only for Chow, and I've never known a guinea pig that actually LIKED chow.<br>  <br>  Also, when the weather is nice and if the outside is not chemically treated, take them out to graze.  Just be sure to supervise them so they don't wander off permanently,|`|8624d8f3c13640e544dfac9ee3736a3faa	I reccomend getting a bowl that clips to the side of the cage.

ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	LOL, she sounds like a normal Basset puppy to me.<br>  <br>  You just have to out stubborn her.  Protect your other dogs by stopping her behavior.  It's okay for the other dogs to tell her off if they are so inclined, but otherwise you are responsible for their safety and comfort.  Use "time outs".  See "You won the Prize!"<br>  <a href="http://www.clickersolutions.com/articles/2002/prize.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickersolutions.com/articles...</a><br>  <br>  Are you taking her to obedience classes?  If not, you should start, but make sure you have a trainer that is experienced with the "non-obedience" breeds and how to motivate them.<br>  <br>  Mostly she needs to grow up.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Raising the average Basset pup can make you want to tear your hair out.  I once sold a pup to a family that had had dogs of other breeds before, and I warned them that Bassets were "different".  They didn't believe me, but later told me that she was the hardest pup to raise they'd ever had.<br>  <br>  It's a good thing they're so fricken cute.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Have you considered finding her a friend for play dates?

9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I am amazed how many people say to rehome a proven biter. I guess people don't realize what a liability that is. Even if you are totally honest about the dog being a biter and manage to find someone willing to take it, you could be sued if that dog ever bites someone again. There are millions of homeless dogs that would never bite anyone, so why save the dog that has bitten his own onwer.....twice?! <br>  <br>  Anyway, there really isn't any other option than having the vet do it. The actual euthanasia isn't that much......then your friend can discuss what to do with the dog's body.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Well, cocker spaniels are notoriously poor with children.  Your friend should have done some more research on her preferred breed.<br>  <br>  As for the dog, have you tried contacting breed rescues?  They might be able to find a quiet, older home for the dog to live in.  But I think that she is right not wanting a temperamental dog around her children.  I wouldn't either.  <br>  <br>  She is just going to have to suck it up and pay the vet fee.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	If an underlying medical reason for the behaviour has been ruled out & the dog is human aggressive then it does need to be humanely euthanized.<br>  <br>  If the veterinary practise your friend has contacted is too expensive, then phone other local practise as the cost of euthanizing a dog varies from practise to practise.|`|GaL66jbQaa	animal control. But has she considered hiring a behaviorist or taking him to a dogs with issues class?|`|f1lpdiNEaa	Could the dog not be taken to a local animal shelter or Dogs Trust? They would also be suitable to offer advice on the subject. Perhaps they would be happy to take him in, train him and place him in a new suitable home. This is what happens when there's not enough time spent training the dog, letting them know where they are in the pecking order of the household. I'm sure he is not a naturally nasty dog and there might be other options other than euthanisia.|`|o5yYVW2Caa	The price of the injection <br>  isn't to bad and if ur friend wants they will let her take her dogs body home and bury it.|`|qMYhZSZdaa	There is no easy answer, if it goes on biting she may be taken to court.. talk to the vet and see if he'll take a small payemnt each month<br>  thats all i can think of|`|ifJnA7AZaa	try any RSPCA thats were i went to put my dog down for the same reason and once it bites its master then he has to go cos he has no respect for any one any more.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You can try the SPCA or other local animal control.  Though they do not look favorably on people who want to dump their problems off on them instead of doing the responsible thing and taking care of it themselves.  It couldn't be more than a couple hundred dollars for her to take the dog to the vet for this ...<br>  <br>  But there is another option.  Try contacting a cocker spaniel breed rescue.  They might take the dog and try to rehabilitate it.  It depends on if the dog is really aggressive or if it's just untrained.  Just be honest with them about what the dog is doing and they'll let you know if they can get the dog into the program and rehabilitate it.  Often times, untrained cockers do become nippy and simply training the dog will fix that.  But since your friend doesn't have the money to put the dog down, I'm not expecting that she's have the money to find a trainer.  The dog shouldn't have to die because of this.  So, have her give rescue a chance.<br>  <br>  You might be able to find a rescue to call here:  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/cockerpages/rescue.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/cockerpages/re...</a><br>  <br>  If the behaviorist told her that, she needs to take the dog to the vet and pay to have the dog put down.

A vet is the only humane way.<br>  <br>  If it is a Cocker Spaniel, they are know to have Cocker Rage Syndrome.  Below is a link with information.  Please read it.

W55tjTcbaa	because they are heartless! some people buy a dog to show off rather than as a companion.  they think of their dog as a trophy rather than a living thing....i will never buy from a breeder. Shelter dogs make the BEST companions!  Oh and my local shelter has A LOT of puppies, I actually just got one from there a few days ago.. so I think it should be the first place anyone looks before getting a dog because they have small and big dogs, old and young dogs, and a lot of different breeds.|`|J2UTO39vaa	We've adopted animals. And I think it's great- when you don't have young kids or other pets. <br>  <br>  We adopted a Florida Brown dog. Sweetest thing ever. Well my toddler made her a nervous wreck so she'd nip him and get all hyper, she learned how to escape her crate when we'd leave- destroying our home and personal things, she even got out of her crate and into a closed tightly rabbit cage and killed one of our rabbits. She got lots of attention but our home wasn't right for her. Also, the shelter lied about her age. They said she was 4 months old. So, we were expecting her to get huge. It's been almost a year and she hasn't grown! She lives with my parents now where she would get SOLE attention. But she still does the same stuff there. <br>  <br>  When you buy from a breeder- that animal is USUALLY guaranteed, you can meet the parents, see the family temperments, know exactly what breed the dog is and what to expect, you know the ACTUAL age and breeders (GOOD ONES) will ask that you bring the animal back to THEM if you can no longer keep it for whatever reason or will exchange the pet if it comes up with some genetic predisposed problem.<br>  <br>  Cats, rabbits and etc, I feel are different and should be adopted. They aren't as destructive as dogs or as dangerous. I've adopted a lot of cats and have never felt they were a bad choice. I do regret adopting that dog though. We are now buying a full breed dog from a breeder for our family with 2 teeny weenies. We know the breed we picked are super gentle and laid back. Try and guarantee me that with some mutt from a shelter.<br>  <br>  *I will say that breed specific rescue groups are awesome! And people should go to them first if possible.|`|Rrpb5aLMaa	since you are so passionate I hope you can get the word out about dogsindanger.com it is a site that actually lists dogs that will be euthanized in the next couple of days to weeks. Check it out and make people aware. GO ANIMAL LOVER!!!!I feel the same way by the way I think you have to be brain dead to not want to help a dog over helping the breeding industry which is the reason so millions of dogs are getting euthanized each year.|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	From my experience of both working in a pet store and rescue, I notice that the people who buy at pet stores tend to be those kind of people who are buying with out brains. Those who aren't knowledgeable on what they are buying, impulse buyers. <br>  People who adopt from rescues and shelters are those who are ready for more pets. That are prepared and so forth.|`|YgGi07Rpaa	Well because people like to see the cute little puppy faces and baby animal faces but i agree completley!!!|`|qYbFMRcUaa	some people aren't too informed about puppy mills and they should be.|`|qKUMaJcXaa	exactly|`|iAQKD2YBaa	Are the animals being euthanized adult dogs ?<br>  <br>  If so, it could possibly be because an animals life is way too short for people who love animals and the older the animal, the less years you have with them.<br>  <br>  You also no an animals history when getting a pup (abuse, breeding, safety with kids etc), there is less chance of this in a baby.<br>  <br>  Hey Sarah, I didn't think that you were directing your comment at me (thanx for clarifying that), but for me I treat my animals like my baby and it really really hurts when they pass away, 12 years is not even long enough to have a pet, let alone getting an older one.  It is probably wrong to feel this way, but I can;t help feeling like this.<br>  <br>  I think that animals should not be able to be breed unless the owner has a "license" to be able to do it, but unfortunately, this is not the case.  I am a very responsible pet owner, my dog has his own single bed in my room and my cat is not allowed outside ever.<br>  <br>  You know the funny thing, I bought a Labrador from a backyard breeder (stupid I know) and at 12 months old we had to spend $2000.00 on an operation because he had elbow displacia - apparently all the pups in the litter wuld have probably been the same - there was another 6 of them.  My husband and I know we should have done the homework but think that if we hadn't have "rescued" him as a pup then he might have gone to an owner who wouldn't have spent the money on him and he would have been put down anyway, but am sure that they would not have been put down the humane way - I guess in a way, we did the same thing as buying from a shelter !!!!  He also has to have an injection every month to stop the arthritis for the rest of his life and he is only 3 years old.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	I understand where you are coming from but some people have a fear of adopting an 'unwanted' dog as they think there will be or is something wrong with the animal (i.e. maybe health wise or behavior).<br>  <br>  Most unwanted dogs are given to shelters due to the fact that their owners rushed into buying a dog and didn't realise how much of a responsibility they can be.<br>  <br>  The main thing to understand about getting a slightly older unwanted dog is that the responsibility and work it takes to train them can on occassion be harder (i.e. the dog may have habits that will require it's re-training or issues due to being abused or not cared for correctly).<br>  <br>  Obviously it is up to the individual as to whether they feel they are experienced enough to deal with and care for a dog that has already belonged to another family.  I would advise anyone who is not an experienced dog owner to tread carefully when decided where they get their dog from.  If people that do not have the correct experience go for a shelter dog, they could end up giving it back which will cause the dog more stress and upset in it's life than being put to sleep with no pain would cause.<br>  <br>  I know where you are coming from though - I have a puppy AND an unwanted dog and thoroughly support anyone (with the right level of experience and attitude) to consider a shelter dog BEFORE a new puppy.<br>  <br>  Great question - have a star<br>  <br>  Check out my website!|`|RjlBrP98aa	I think it's because many people want "new" or "unused" pets so they can raise them entirely. This way they feel more like it's "their" pet. <br>  <br>  Some also buy because they want to breed and the animals and most from shelters and rescue groups are spayed/neutered. <br>  <br>  And still others buy on impulse. They see the cute rabbit in the store and say awww, I want it.. and buy it because they want it NOW.<br>  <br>  But adopting is FAR better. They are healthier, handled more, and all around good for the owner and the pet.|`|XTGGNRHIaa	My dog was adopted...and I loved him<3<br>  <br>  Some people just want to have a puppy instead of buying an older dog, but I know what you mean.<br>  <br>  I decided that I'm going to adopt all of my pets when I have my own house. They're not bad animals, must of the time their previous owner abused them or couldn't take care of them anymore. <br>  <br>  Personally I think more people should adopt, older dogs need a good home too. = )|`|bDPVRtCNaa	My dogs did not come from puppy mills, but neither did I adopt them. I'm not selfish, and I'm not ignorant for doing so. I love all of my animals, and they all receive the best care. You can't make me feel guilty about raising three gorgeous dogs.<br>  There are no kill shelters in my area.<br>  <br>  My first two Labradors came from a breeder a state away. She took excellent care of the dogs, and we visited multiple times before taking our first puppy home. The next year we bought another black Lab from her. Then her husband died and she stopped breeding her dogs. So now 11 years later we still have our first two Labs, and my mom wanted another one, so we searched for the bloodline of our first two Labs, and found a descendant of my first dogs sire. <a href="http://www.tulgeywoodlabs.com/pages/savoy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tulgeywoodlabs.com/pages/savo...</a><br>  <br>  My leopard gecko was given to me by my neighbor because her kids had become tired of her, and I adopted my blind tree frog.

Just like with human babies, some people will go out of their way to conceive through infertility treatment rather than adopting.  That doesn't mean they are bad people, they have their own reasons.<br>  <br>  I look forward to the day when I can go to a shelter and rescue a dog (won't happen until I get a house) but I can see the appeal of getting a puppy.  It is rare to find puppies in shelters (they get adopted so quickly) but it is certainly possible so it can never hurt to check there first if you really have your heart set on a baby!|`|XI2iylR4aa	I don't know, I can't understand.  The only potentially valid reason I've heard is that a person with allergies wants a dog that is hypo-allergenic.  But then, there are breed-specific rescues, so I kind of just feel that a lot of people are too lazy to go through the adoption process.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of ignorance out there, too.  People think that a "new" pet is somehow better than a "used" one.  They wonder about shelter dogs' temperament, but i'd say that shelter dogs have had much more interaction with people than pet shop dogs have.  <br>  <br>  I don't know, it makes me sad.|`|AA10356572	stupidity and selfishness,, except for those buying from reputable breeders who are intent on showing their animals.  <br>  <br>  I actually heard a person say "I can never go to the shelter because its too sad".... why the heck did she think it would not be sad if she didnt go there to help?|`|EFYkci30aa	Oh, I know!!!

If you are really a dog lover (or cat lover) go save on from the pound instead of contributing to puppy mills and the millions of homeless animals.<br>  <br>  Awesome question (wish it didn't need to be asked).  Oh, thank you for letting me vent about this.<br>  <br>  <br>  Addition to Trissh - I adopted my mutt from the pound when he was 7 years old because nobody wanted an "old' dog.  He turned out to be the best dog ever, he's loyal, grateful, kind, very well behaved and lets my kids climb all over him.  It's horrible not to adopt a dog just because of his or her age.  Don't judge a book by the cover. . .and if one is such an "animal lover" why wouldn't you want to adopt a dog that is unlikely to be adopted (provided he's safe for your family).  <br>  <br>  When I adopted my cat from the shelter the first question asked was "okay, so who's been here the longest" and that cat and I clicked and I took him home. . .I didn't look for the cutest, the prettiest, I looked for the cat that most needed me.  He's been with me now for 8 years.  So called "animal lovers" can often be so selfish, ugh.  (I'm not directing this at you, Trissh, sorry if I came off that way, I'm  just saying in general).

A heat lamp or under tank heater is necessary, for they need to bask. Day temps. should be 80-85 degrees, and might temps. can get as low as 65 degrees. I would recommend a thermometer, to keep track of the temp. in the cage. Use paper towel for their cage's bottom, since sand can cause impaction, leading to death. Use a shallow, half inch high plastic cap for a water dish. Though they cannot climb, a lid is needed to ensure nothing happens. A hide box of 6" by 6" is necessary, and be sure to mist the inside and the paper towel under it, as this will aid in shedding. They can be handled, but don't do it often. If you do get one, and have any questions, please ask me or go to www.leopardgecko.com|`|DHCXeLvvaa	I'd go with a leopard gecko they only need a water bowl, heat lamp or pad, 10-20 gallon tank, hiding places, and substrate sand, paper towels, news paper<br>  <br>  Also you feed them once a day a few crickets
c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Oh, the hacking thing.  We went through that with one of our dogs, but it was a constant thing (not just after exertion), and there was some degree of phlegm.  It ended up costing us a little over $1,000.00 to find out that he had allergic bronchitis.  He's fine, he's off the meds now, but it's definitely worth getting it checked out at the vets.  Good luck!|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	If you haven't had your dog on heartworm prevention, a simple blood test could help rule that out.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Um, you hope?<br>  <br>   FInd a veterinarian and make an appointment.<br>  <br>   Have them investigate the problem, and do whatever they say.<br>   I hope your dog doesn't have heartworm, too - but if you don't know, it's possible you should also ask the vet to help you find a new home for this poor dog.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The first thing that came to my mind when I saw the title was heartworm.  I could be something else but in any case, the dog needs to see a vet.<br>  <br>  Missing a month here and there isn't that big a deal, but if you've gone long periods without heartworm meds, that can cause a problem.

Cfk1kr8Daa	NO PUPPIES. PERIOD.<br>  <br>   The only dog I would ever recommend anyone get with such young children is a used Labrador or Golden that comes from rescue, and was originally turned in by a family.  A dog of about three years old is perfect, one that will be around for long enough, but also one that has already gone through all the puppy stuff, and is not going to plow over the kids.<br>  <br>    Sadly, there are all too many 'perfect' dogs in rescue these days because of the mortgage crisis and the economy - many familes are forced to reliquish their dogs to the pound, in tears, because they can barely feed their kids.<br>  <br>    But you can give a dog like this a new home, and get the safest, best thing for our own family, in the process of saving a life.<br>  <br>    Not only do you have to think about your kids, but they will soon be old enough to have friends, and the last thing you need is a dog that will do anything to a child who is not used to dogs. Can you say HUGE LAWSUIT?  You want a big behemoth of a slow boat that just lumbers around while the kids do all the stuff little kids do, all over the dog.<br>  <br>    Puppies are cute, but they are lethal with those baby teeth, and the last thing you want is to ahve any child bitten in the face, while the puppy thinks it's just teething.  <br>  <br>    Or a toddler that is decked by a large puppy that is jkust jumping up to play - that is where two generations of non-dog owners come from, after the child is so traumatized by thaht seemingly simple act that they will not go near another dog.<br>  <br>    Seriously, just go find an experienced nanny of a dog that needs a home, and call it a lucky thing there are so many to adopt.  Rarely can you do so much good in one fell swoop, and get what you need in return.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Big dogs do a lot better with kids than small dogs do.  Little dogs actually bite a lot more often than big dogs do, you just never hear about it because nobody was ever killed by a 10 pound dog.  Little dogs are also a lot easier for a kid to hurt accidentally.  Little dogs and kids don't mix.<br>  Get something a bit older, at least three years old, as a puppy won't be patient with kids.  A lab would be a good dog for you.  Check your local shelter or petfinder.com to find one that needs a home.|`|9kTejB0uaa	My honest advice would be to wait until your children are both over 5.  You have your hands full as it is, and adding a puppy into the scene is going to give you even more work.  Children of this age tend to regard a puppy as 'another toy', and that's not fair on any puppy, regardless of whether they are 'good with kids' or not.  <br>  <br>  It might work if you get an older dog however, one from rescue who has been used to living with small children.  However I never sold my puppies to people with children of these ages, unless they were experienced dog owners already.  And my breed is excellent as a family dog.  Sorry.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I would not have a puppy or a small breed dog around kids that age. <br>  <br>  I would go for a lab, golden or newfoundland adult rescue.  With all you're going to have a lot of shedding and with a newfie, you'll have drool too, but these breeds are usually very good with kids.  Especially the Newfies.|`|sUXyRlVjaa	I'd wait awhile, until your daughter is at least 3 and old enough to understand how to treat a pup before getting a dog.  Not that it couldn't work if you are diligent enough but it would be better to wait.<br>  <br>  Some good possible breeds, assuming you buy from a responsible breeder and take the time to properly train the pup, would be Collies (rough or smooth), Golden Retrievers, Border Terriers, Cocker Spaniels, or Beagles.  Be sure to do a lot of research and talk to several breeders.  <a href="http://www.akc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/</a> is a good starting point.|`|fbguVOiQaa	Hi, my daughter is 4 and i have a 13 month old boy, we are getting a labrador on sunday as i have found these to be a good breed around children. My mum use to have a golden cocker spaniel which was very soft and friendly|`|6eH88Fh6aa	I have always owned terriers and found them to be playful and kid friendly. But it's mostly based on the personality of the dog.  Some can handle when a child naturally pulls their tail and some will not.  It's best to go to your local humane association with your children.  They will help you find a dog that will fit with your family.|`|BrVl7L89aa	You may want to get a puppy, but with a 19 month old I would not suggest that. I have a 3 year old sister that loves to pull tails and ears not to mention try to jump on the dogs once in a while. When we were looking for a dog we started looking for a puppy like many people do, we ended up with a Golden retriever that is so loving and caring we couldnt ask for a better dog, She is 3 years old and loves my sister very much. I would say get either a Lab or a Golden retriever just out of the puppy years. When you think of big dogs just think of gental giants when it comes to these two breeds. Thats what I would go with.|`|IQezKzNEaa	My personal opinion--Labradors and Golden Retrievers.  My parents got a Golden when I was two years old, so I have a special attachment to those.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, you have a very high chance of getting a good-tempered Golden or Lab.  They have been consistently popular dogs in the U. S. for a reason.  You should still put them in training and work hard to introduce them to your children, because there is always some risk associated with dogs and kids.  Don't think this is just big dogs.  Your big dog might be more apt to knock over your kids on accident, small dogs can sometimes be quite vicious.  ANY dog can be a danger:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.igorilla.com/gorilla/animal/2001/pomeranian.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.igorilla.com/gorilla/animal/2...</a><br>  <br>  So always, always supervise your children and dogs together!  <br>  <br>  I also suggest that you might look at rescues.  You might want to avoid shelters unless they do stringent temperament testing.  Rescues keep their dogs in foster homes, and the foster mom or dad will be able to tell you if the dog is good with kids, housebroken, trained, etc.  Fewest surprises!  And an older dog or even older puppy will probably be easier than a  very young puppy.<br>  <br>  If you do go to a shelter, check if they temperament test.  One of my local shelters tests EVERY dog that goes through by pushing around, pulling tails, taking away food, etc, so those are definitely good dogs.  However, some of the high-kill shelters just don't have the staffing, know-how, or care to do this, and every dog just gets their 3 days before it is euthanized.  There is no guarantee that you'll get a good dog here!  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you find that perfect fit for your family!|`|bDsIgFoXaa	well if you want a big dog get a great dane or Newfoundland. they are very good with kids even though they are huge. if you want a small dog do not get a poodle. they are very mean. most little dogs will snap at people so be careful. a cocker or **** zu would be good.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  There are dogs who are fond of kids yet there are who aren't.

2LZbzvY3aa	A really useful thing to make a rabbit playpen out of is a baby gate.  You can put it at the entrance of the room and he won't get out.<br>  <br>  Or, why not just make your own playpen from boxes?  You can get really creative and give your rabbit a good time by making an entrance  I mean, take a bunch of boxes same size, and cut ends off of every box (box has eight sides, cut one side off and then side directly on the opposite end) then put all the boxes together at the ends you'v'e cut out and put them in a circle or a square shape.  On a fewf of the boxes you can cut an entrance for Abu.  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/roxy_shalom/bunnypen.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/roxy_shalom/bun...</a><br>  <br>  see how its like a hollow set of boxes with an entrance for him?  It serves the dual purpose of keeping him in the square area, and he has a seperate little world to explore inside of the boxes<br>  <br>  There are lots of things you can make as toys for Abu.  Remember, rabbit's teeth are always growing and they need to "saw" them down so that's why they chew.  Abu will have a lot of fun with toilet paper rollers (empty ones!!!)  Things that make noise and he can move around like the lids off of detergent bottles.  But make sure to clean them really well.  Bunnies love cat toys, ones that have bells and make noise.    What about giving him an old container for whipped cream or something like this?/  He can knock it around.  Try filling it wil treats and the smell will get him going and it will make noises too.  Try and get him a really large roller or some sort, and he wlil climb through it over and over again.<br>  <br>  Another thing your bunny will love that is cheap is alfalfa hay  Rabbit LOVE hay!  This will also keep him chewing.<br>  <br>  If you put the litter pan in the playpen, start out by making the area really small because rabbits use the litter box in the cage because they want to live in a clean area.  But if they have your whole house, they dont mind leaving droppings because it isnt making THEIR habitat dirty.  So if you give him a small place to start out with he will by default use the box.  Expand the area slowly and slowly and you will have trained him OUTSIDE of the cage to use the pan!  <br>  <br>  You can easily get him fixed for under $100 depending on where you are.  Not all animal shelters fix pets.  Try going online and looking up spay and neuter clinics in your city.  There are clinics that deal only with spay and neuturing and they are usually much cheaper.  You should be able to get him fixed for $75.  <br>  <br>  As for cat litter, well it's been years since I owned rabbits but I always remember a litter that came in a plastic container with a lid you would screw off and you would pour that  It was relatively cheap.  The knock off bag brands are the worst and just clump together.  But I"m sure your kitty pine is just fine!!!
RT8LZy7gaa	Ick is pretty easy to cure actually,  You treat the water with some drops or fizzy tablets you buy at the store. If they only have a mild case of it, you should be able to get rid of it soon.  Take the charcoal out of the filter when you treat the tank though (the instructions will tell you to do this as well I believe), and do a good water change after the treatment is over. Put new filter media in after the treatment is over.<br>  <br>  Goldfish don't need heaters, and that wouldn't cause ick. The only time I had a problem with ick was when I added a new fish that I guess had it (didn't have white spots when I put him in there!). I always look at the tank that the fish I want to buy is in to make sure the tank mates aren't infected.  Guess that one slipped past  me!<br>  <br>  If you start treatment of the tank before you leave, just leave instructions if you need to add more medicine to the water. The fizzy tablets work well on minor infections. Its not difficult to dose them, but I honestly can't remember if you have to treat it daily for a certain number of days.  Check the instructions on whatever you buy, they're pretty easy to follow.|`|JAdsp3iwaa	They can live about a week or two with Ick, depending on how many fish are in the tank. The more fish infected, the quicker it spreads all over the tank. There's this solution called "Quick Cure" sold at every petstore and wal-mart for about $2. Add one drop for every 2 gallons of water in your tank every day until they are cured. Remember to take the carbon out of your filter. You can replace it after they are cured. Also, don't forget water changes. Remove about 10% of the water every other day.
DtkLsetkaa	With this many cats in the house I am assuming they are fixed?  If not, that's your first step.  That will help immensely with the aggression.  I can only conclude that sickie cat still smells like the vet, and they are viewing you as almost a traitor for paying it more attention.  Give it some time, are they physically going after each other?  Or is it all verbal threats?  Try to play and pay attention to your other cats a little more than normal, and give them some nice treats or a nice dinner, this may help a bit.|`|M04TBx3Baa	Yes this happens because your cat smells very different! It is almost like you are introducing a new cat into the family. But don't worry once you cuddle your cat and it gets its smell back everything will be back to normal. I  suggest that you pet and hold the cat that went to the vet as much as possible but be careful don't give to much attention to the one cat, your other cats will be jealous and start fighting even more. Once your cat's smell is back (it takes about 2 or 3 days at the most) everything will become normal again.|`|eTXqHQYaaa	That's how my cats reacted when i took one other cat home, i think its the smell on the drugged cat and on you, because you have gone to the vets, they probably remember the smell andrememberr what happened when they were around that smell, if its persists then you could buy a book, there are lots of cat behaviour books around that might resolve the reason.<br>  Also sometimes, when cats are feeling a bit under the weather they like to be alone, not being picked up (If you felt ill you wouldn't like to be picked up!) maybe this is a reason?<br>  It shouldn't last too long! x
l0ktQUnWaa	Don't feed her lettuce or tomatoes, both are bad!. I feed mine dandelion greens, endive, asparagus, bok choy (once weekly), sweet potato, papaya, blueberries, lentils and lima beans (both ground). Bird seed is good, bananas are very high in phosphorous (this can block calcium absorption) feed sparingly. A calcium supplement is good, also use a vitamin supplement. You need to get the basking temperature up to 120-130 degrees. I use a 75 watt halogen spot light on a dimmer and a Mega Ray Mercury Vapor bulb to achieve this temperature. Use a digital thermometer. Night time temperatures can drop into the 60's. She needs a hide that is low, so she can squeeze in. They like it touching their backs. No water in the tank. It needs to be very dry. Uromastyx do not need water to drink, they get what they need from their food.  I use unglazed slate tile for substrate. A little aspen bedding will give her something to dig in. A basking rock and not much else is needed. <br>  <a href="http://reptileuv.com/" rel="nofollow">http://reptileuv.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/uromastyx.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/uromastyx.html</a><br>  Good Luck! Any other questions, send me an email!|`|RkK673VHaa	good thing shes not eating dont feed any herbivore reptiles lettuce, its basically crunchy water(no nutritional value) and it tastes good to them so they keep eating it and refuse other foods.<br>  <br>  it might be still settling in or it might be too hot or cold what are the temps. also try other foods like dandlions, kale, green (collard and radish seem to be favorites) carrots (the who things tops and all can be fed) and squashes like butternut squash
MKuDawP7aa	Guppies are considered one of the easiest fish to breed. They are sometimes known as the millions fish because of their ability to produce masses of offspring. For this reason they are a good species for people new to fish reproduction and parenthood. Breeding guppies at home is a rewarding experience for fish keepers looking to expand their hobby. It is also a great exercise for children interested in nature and science.<br>  <br>  The different sexes are easy to differentiate so choosing likely parent will pose no problem. Aim to match the male and female's color so a strong line of guppies can be created. Males and females can breed freely themselves but mixed offspring often have washed out colors and poorly defined patterns. To breed the best quality fish this is one of the most important things to keep in mind.<br>  <br>  New guppies from a pet store are likely to be housed in the same tank regardless of the color. The fertilization from one mating can last for several batches of tiny fry. For these reasons female guppies are likely to throw all manner of mixed colors at first. After a number of broods the female will be better suited for producing selectively bred progeny.<br>  <br>  One male can meet the needs of several females so even numbers are not required. Females will typically give birth every thirty days with adults producing 30 - 60 offspring at a time. The larger a guppy is the more babies she is likely to have.<br>  <br>  What they do need is ample feeding and a suitable environment. Offer protein rich foods such as bloodworms or brine shrimp in addition to tropical flakes. This should be done for several weeks to condition the females to produce good numbers of large guppy fry. The aquarium should be furnished with plants to give the newly born fry a place of refuge. This gives the new fish a safe haven should any adults in the tank mistake them for a quick meal.<br>  <br>  Although a dedicated breeding tank is the best way to breed guppies you may also have some success in a community tank. Breeder traps and nets are sold to help this process. They protect the expected fry from other fish by creating a physical barrier. The expecting female is placed inside and observed at regular intervals until the fry are born. She will then be placed back in the community while the fry are left to grow inside the device. After a few weeks the guppies will have grown enough to stand a greater chance against hungry predators.<br>  <br>  For fastest growth guppy fry should be fed on newly hatched brine shrimp. Fine powdered tropical flake will usually be taken should brine shrimp be too much for you to manage with. Make 25% water changes at least weekly and do not overcrowd the tank with too many fish. With ample feeding, clean water and plenty of space to grow these tiny fish can become small adults in about two months.|`|1c2adb2d5aad294a18068c79ec140867aa	Breeding guppies is fun, I used to do it.  At maximum we had 500+ (of course we had a 55 gallon tank).  We are going to want to keep your tank between 60 and 70 degrees when the females are giving birth. Keep your pregnant mothers and "horny" males in one tank (the largest) and put your babies (after 1-2 weeks) in one of the smaller tanks to grow, introduce them back into the tank after they have grown to about HALF of average size.<br>  <br>  You females probably died during birth because of water temp, stress (from tank size) and maybe something with the water.  Make sure you get some Ick Treatment and if you are using tap water make sure you use water treatment so the water is pure.  For the breeding tank (your 10 gallon) you will need a heater, proper air pump, and a filtration system.|`|NArS7hYEaa	get a 20 gallon tank and let em go. I suggest getting one more female though. put the babies in the 10 gallon tank once their born, so the adult ones won't eat them. then, when their grown a little, you can sell em! see if your local pet store will buy the to sell.|`|JAdsp3iwaa	Perhaps the fish died while giving birth from stress. A crowded aquarium could have definitely caused this.|`|Jhl17egmaa	Well you probably have too many fish. But if that is not the case the tank might of gotten too dirty.What I recommendd is that you get a sponge on a stick and clean it more often. Also if there are bits of food left scoop them out to keep it clean.<br>  Hope i could help!|`|mOayTJDmaa	Get a 3 more females and keep them all in the 10 gallon.  Keep any babies in the 2.5 gallons and give them away.  Guppies can give birth to 60 babies every 6 weeks.

tPGxPDvBaa	Possible but fairly slim.<br>  <br>  There are ingredients in human shampoos that are not tolerated well by pets & can be harmful . ETOH is one & is not required by law to be included on product list since it isn't harmful to ppl but it is to pets. It can penetrate skin & go to the fatty tissues &/or bloodstream. ETOH is a potent nervous system depressant & can be fatal if the levels become high enough & with regular use.  ETOH is the strongest chemical in ppl shampoo that can effect dogs & the main reason not to use ppl shampoo on pets.  I'm sure there probably is a blood test they could do to test the levels in your dog but unless you were using ppl shampoo all the time to bathe your dog - I hope that is not the case - then there wouldn't any point to do so.  Small dogs are so overbred that seizures are common & not rare.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	I wouldn't think so.....one of the dog kinds, Hartz, can be deadly, but you were using human shampooo...but if the dog had a seizure get it to the vet as soon as possible.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	There's nothing in human shampoo that would cause seizures.|`|Tpls1ZXgaa	you should ask your vet what shampoo should you use for your dog|`|IowG78BGaa	call the vet.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Doubtful.

yyf5N7Ogaa	You should be able to tell if they will have long or short coats already, and if they will have the longer heads or smushed faces. They may have sort of in-between coats and faces but again you should be able to tell at birth.  The color of the kittens, blue or seal point, can be either brown (seal) or blue based on the color of the parents. <br>  <br>  A trick to figure out what which color the kittens will be is to look at the paw pads. Seal points will have light brownish pads and blue point will have light blue-gray pads. The actual point colors won't come in for several more weeks.<br>  <br>  ADD: Of course you can predict what they will look like. They will have Siamese color-points and some combination of Siamese and Hemmie boning and head style. DUH!|`|lvMLxFSkaa	They will be beautiful!<br>  <br>  My guess is that the kitties will have long or semi-long fur.  They will probably be born white or nearly all white, and darken as they grow up.  I'd also guess that the points on the new kitties will be brown (at least on most of them).  I'd expect them to have the more fox-like face, but, who knows.  Cats do what they want to do, don't they?<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your new kittens!|`|YUQgyPT3aa	they will look like mixed breed cats....you cannot predict physical and personality traits when mixing breeds.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	With a Siamese/Himi mix you have a pointed cat either way, so its weird that your mom cat doesn't have color points on the ears.  Is there color on the ears, face, feet, and tail?  If not, then it sounds like you have an extra mix of white/bicolor in mom.<br>  <br>  Siames and Himi's are both pointed cats - unless its a mix with a bicolor like a Ragdoll and you have white too.<br>  <br>  Anyway - the kittens probably will be more longhairs then short.  If mom is shorter hair except on the tail, then the kittens will be semi-longhair to full longhair.  Sounds like you have blue points for both or mom is a chocolate point.|`|4TX26viFaa	Both have the long hair gene, so the kittens will likely be long haired. A blend of faces, as there are two 'short faces' genes there but also the longer one of the Siamese.  Points too, the kittens will be a blend.  <br>  <br>  The color of the points would depend on what the grandparents had as well.  <br>  <br>  So in other words, I'd say no tabby, bi-color or otherwise 'ordinary' kitten coat patterns would show up.

Like the first answerer said, there are lots of sites and videos that will help you.<br>  <br>  myhorsesmom, my reiners do wring their tails around sometimes, and it's just because they're excited and love to rein.  Stacy Westfall's mare loves her job, there are videos of her doing that by herself.

At least the horse's tail is not just limp, that could mean that they are medicating her to do that.|`|WSO5K0wvaa	Personal opinion - your horse will do it if your horse knows what you are asking and your horse is happy.  I've seen the video with Stacy Westfall and I don't believe her horse is a happy horse.  She is doing what she is "trained" to do but she wrings her tail and swishes it.  Happy horses don't do that.

It is possible to have a crate that's too small, but hard to have a crate that's too big.<br>  <br>  He's twice the size of my shepherd when she was 7 weeks, she was 8 pounds then and grew to be 50 pounds.

I've seen huge puppies end up being smaller dogs and vice-versa, so I really can't tell you. <br>  What you can do though, is invest in a large crate that comes with a divider. That way, you can make it small enough for him now and enlarge it as he grows.....then you'll be prepared for any size he may become. Plus, once a dog is fully house trained, it doesn't hurt to have them in a nice, large crate.|`|GaL66jbQaa	He's gonna be big. My English Mastiff pup was 19 lbs at 8 and a half weeks and judging by her family will be between 170 and 210.  my mastiff/ shepherd mix was about 13 lbs at 8 weeks and ended up being about 100 lbs. my best guess is your dog will be well over a hundred maybe 120. but you really can't make a good prediction till they're about 6 months|`|bDsIgFoXaa	you might want to get a large or xlarge crate because he will want to have room. I have 2 cockers and the sleep in an xlarge crate. He might get really big. check out the breed standards and he should fall somewhere in the 2 standards. also if you can look at his father. that will be a good example. our puppies always were the size of our male.|`|IFiwmb3Haa	If you're concerned about how much to feed your dog because you don't know the size he's suppose to be then here are a couple of things to help you gauge.<br>  <br>  First, you should be able to feel your dogs ribs but not see them when standing calmly.<br>  <br>  Second, when he's full grown, if you can grab a bunch of skin and it's really loosy goosy then it's time to cut back on the food.<br>  <br>  If you're really interested, some Pet Hospitals will preform DNA testing and will tell you what breeds are in your mix, that way you can gauge a little bit better.<br>  <br>  Other than that it's going to be a wait and see kind of thing.  It'll be a fun surprise!|`|d5EzCedtaa	Hi there! <br>  <br>  The way I judge is with the knuckle of the dog... on the front leg, at the front, above the paw. <br>  <br>  Generally if this knuckle is out of proportion with the rest of the leg, the dog still has quite a long way to grow. This is due to the fact that the knee has a growth plate, and this is where it is most obvious. It slims down as the dog grows. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say there is any difinitive way to estimate his growth, final size or weight purely because every dog is so different, even from the same litter. Plus not knowing the exact breed etc, estimation is incredibly difficult.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I can't help you further and I hope you are both well xx

fZ2fwKG6aa	I have been a tank enthusiast for about 15 years, and I have had plenty of experience with both freshwater (i/e. c02 injection planted aquariums), and saltwater aquariums. If you go to www.adgshop.com they have a filter that you run your injection through. What I am trying to say is that you run the injection with the filter. Buy a good regulator and you will never have to worry about over doing the injection. place the end of the injector near a powerhead or a filter exit in order for the co2 to mve.<br>  <br>  To have a complete aquarium CO2 system you must have the following:<br>  <br>  Reactor<br>  Regulator<br>  Bubble Counter<br>  Hose<br>  CO2 Bottle  <br>  <br>  To have a completely automated aquarium CO2 system you need to ALSO have the following:<br>  <br>  Solenoid Valve<br>  pH Controller<br>  <br>  If you are using these CO2 products with a Calcium Reactor, you'll need the Regulator, Bubble Counter, Hose and CO2 bottle, but will not need the CO2 reactor. The Calcium Reactor will take the place of the CO2 reactor. For an automated system include the Solenoid Valve and pH controller.|`|NArS7hYEaa	yes. for about 20 minutes after the injection. least thats how my friend did it....

jV7SmnaTaa	Yeah - I agree with you 100%.  1000 would be reasonable.  I would think that there wouldn't be a whole lot of people that wanted her right now though with the horse market in such a slump though - they could start the price at $1000, but would probably get $500-700.  It's a great time to buy...just not sell!|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I agree that 1000 is reasonable, but you will probably have to offer more if she isn't for sale.  If she's not for sale they might not want to sell her so it'll take more to get her away from them.  Start your offer at 1000, and if they decline go up to 1250 and go up to 1500 if they decline that.  Don't go over 1500 for that horse.<br>  <br>  Make sure to get a vet to check her out before you purchase her.<br>  <br>  I guess you are attached to this horse, but if you can't get her there are plenty of others who are probably better and are selling for less right now.  Keep in mind that because of the economy horses are selling for less right now than they normally would.|`|0bA8EyT9aa	i think you are right around 1,000 would sound right but just remember there are plenty of other horses that dont have thrush get sores or get pissy when is season! <br>  <br>  Make shore to look around before you buy!!!!|`|XowJOTB7aa	i whould pay friom 1000 to 1800|`|9ycJ261daa	The cost of the horse is based on if it is registered or not let alone the age and breed. Here in my home town horses are a dime a dozen so to speak. Some want thousands of dollars for them or only ask a few hundred. But to me the papers don't make the animal of any given breed. It just a haze-mat so people can make more money. People who really want one can't afford them. A unregistered horse is worth less with out papers no matter the back ground even if known. I own two fillies that are out of a well known quarter horse named Sand Peppy but no papers to prove it with out a blood test. Their owners sold them to me for a mere $300.00 that was for both of them a two and three year old.But with out seeing a picture of the Horse you ask about I could not give you a good quote. And with her age she is not worth a lot. And it is hard to tell someone over the net the price of anything because it upsets people when they give the wrong quote and things go bad. I would check around and price other horses before making a decision and then talk to people who own her and find out their asking price and then make a reasonable offer. Good luck.|`|kixQWODVaa	$1000 would be my top price for that horse.  The horse market is way down and horses aren't going for what they use to.  <br>  <br>  But in saying that Im a hypocrite.  I just bought a 3 1/2 yr arab/QH filly that I have been training I paid $750 for her.  She is very sound, smart and loves to learn but she was only worth about $500 so why did I buy her?  Because I love the way she learns she has a LOT of try.  <br>  <br>  So what Im saying is start low but if you really want that horse some times you have to pay more.  I agree with the people above I wouldn't go over $1500 I wouldn't have gone over $1000 for my filly you have to draw the line somewhere.
MKuDawP7aa	Chihuahua potty training is a necessary task if you're going to enjoy your new puppy. It's easy to get started and patience and consistency are the keys to success. Most Chihuahuas can be trained fairly quickly, but Chihuahuas sometimes are difficult to train so do be patient.<br>  <br>  Your dog will almost always give some signs when elimination is about to happen. Observe your puppy and you will begin to see those signs.<br>  <br>  Then follow these tips for getting Chihuahua potty training done.<br>  <br>  1. Take him where you want the elimination to happen at these times:<br>  <br>  <br>  immediately after every meal (three times a day for puppies); <br>  after any naps; <br>  when you take him from his crate; <br>  just before bed time; <br>  whenever it looks like the time is right!<br>  <br>  2. Use a crate. Most puppies don't want to make a mess in their sleeping area. If you keep the puppy in a crate most of the time while house breaking, you can more closely observe for sign of elimination about to happen. Then quickly take the puppy where they need to go.<br>  <br>  3. Be lavish with praise. Success should be praised, but just patiently and quietly clean up messes. Accidents will happen.<br>  <br>  4. Establish a consistent time for feeding. Always feed at the same times and then watch very closely after feeding for the signs that the pup needs to go.<br>  <br>  5. Always be patient . Learning what to do is harder for some dogs than others. Always remember that learning is happening and it sometimes takes some time. Be sure your puppy is old enough to control elimination. The puppy breeder can help you know how old your puppy should be.<br>  <br>  In just a short time your puppy will know how to communicate with you when he or she needs to go out. Keep patiently working with your pup and you will soon have success with Chihuahua potty training.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	Using pads or a litter box just teaches them that it's okay to go in the house, throw them out!<br>  Get a crate just big enough for pup to stand up and turn around in.<br>  At least an hour before bedtime pick up all food and water. Just before you put puppy in the crate for the night take him out and WAIT with him. Say key words like "get busy" or "go potty". When he does his business PRAISE him lavishly, GOOD GET BUSY! GOOD PUPPY! make him think he has done the most wonderful thing in the world. Then take him in and crate him. Put the crate near where you sleep so you can hear him in the night, if he starts to rustle around or whine, take him out, wait for it, PRAISE, then back to bed.<br>  First thing in the morning, outside, wait for it, praise.<br>  Then go about your day, keeping puppy in sight at all times, when you see potty behavior, circling, sniffing, squatting, scoop puppy up, outside, wait for it, praise! If you can't watch puppy, take him out first, wait for it, (saying "key words"), praise, then put him in his crate with some toys and chewies. As soon as puppy comes out of the crate, outside, wait for it, praise. If puppy has an accident just quietly clean it up and watch him closer next time.<br>  Pretty soon you will be able to take him out and say the key words and he'll go right away. I ask mine, do you want to go "get busy" in a happy high pitched voice while we head for the door and they all run out and do their business right away.<br>  Puppies have trouble holding it for long periods of time, just like babies, so there will be a few accidents, but, if you are consistant with this method you will have a reliably house trained dog in no time!|`|T864ejaiaa	my girl friend has a dog that uses a litter box. you'll have to stick it's nose in the poop or pee and tell him no. then place him on the pad. you might even have to take the poop and place it on the puppy pad and let him see it. you can also try laying the puppy pads where he has gone. to me crates are for lazy people.|`|qapJU3tMaa	It's a PUPPY, not a BABY.  Why do you want to teach your pup to pee and poop in the house?  Take it outside.  When you can't supervise, crate the pup.|`|yPhCujOvaa	I have found the potty pads to just be too confusing.  On one hand, you want to teach the dog that the entire house is our (the family/pack, whatever) den and we do not pee and poo in the den.  But, on the other hand, this is confusing because the dog is able to go in one area in the den that supposedly cannot be used as a toilet.  The problem here is that the dog never builds the ability or desire to hold it until an appropriate time.  I strongly believe you need to crate train the dog.  I am against potty pads and litter boxes, but it is possible, provided you crate train as well.  The crate is so small that the dog would need to sit in it's own pee and poo if it went there, so it will hold it.  When you let the dog out, always take it to the location you want it to go and give lavish praise when he does.  Usually, this is outside, but in this case, you can take the dog to the litter box or pee pads or whatever you are using.  As your dog gets older and his bladder increases in size, he will be able to hold it longer and can be trusted in a larger crate, exercise pen or a small room.  The idea is to build his den instinct up to encompass the entire house gradually.|`|NBeQyTlMaa	Crates are not for lazy people. Since puppies are taught by their mothers, and since it is in their instinct, they will not eliminate where they sleep. A crate is your best bet. He doesn't have to sleep in there. Just put him in there when you can't watch him... like when you go to work or are going somewhere you can't take him. <br>  <br>  I have a 7 week old puppy myselft right now, and he sleep with me at night. First thing in the morning (sometimes if he wakes up in the middle of the night we go then) I take him to the same section of grass in my apartment complex and say "go potty". Then we go inside and I feed him, then we play some, and before I go to work, I repeat taking him outside and telling him to "go potty". <br>  <br>  When I get home for lunch, its the same thing - take him outside first thing, then feed him (because puppies should eat 3 - 4 times a day), we go inside, he plays with my other dog while I eat lunch, then before I head back to work I take him out again, and put him back in his crate. <br>  <br>  When I get off work, I repeat the same thing. I take him to the same place, tell him the same thing, and so far it has been really successful. He has only had 2 accidents in the house, and only pottied in his crate the first day he used it. <br>  <br>  I think it helps teach them how to hold it, along with where they are permitted to go. <br>  <br>  Also, when he is out of his crate, watch him like a hawk. Make sure he is in your site at ALL times - if it looks like he is sniffing around to go potty, take him to his permitted potty spot. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. He might whine when you put him in his crate. You can fix this with positive reinforcement by giving him treats when he goes in his crate. Practice this over and over again. Tell him to "kennel up" or have phrase associated with goin in his kennel, lead him in there with it, and then overly praise him and give him a treat when he is in there. I have even built on that with my pup to get him to sit down when he goes in there and then I give him the treat. He has to sit for (10) seconds though. If you practice this for 5 minutes, then quit for an hour or so, and do it again, he will learn the crate is a good thing. <br>  <br>  Research Crate training online. It really is the way to go. Most websites will tell you to have your dog sleep in there too, but I don't make either one of my dogs sleep in a crate. They sleep in my bed and then I put them in crates when I leave for work.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Some puppies do not like the sound of pee on a pee pad.  The litter box method, I think uses a paper pellet, but is better because it doesn't let the puppy move around a lot.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.

EJpiaCMQaa	If you get more than one bird, it's always best to quarantine the two of them.  You can never be sure either bird you're getting isn't ill.  I recommend a vet exam when you first get the bird(s) so if the bird is ill, you can catch anything early.  If the bird (s) isn't ill, at least that will ease your mind.<br>  <br>  You can have one budgie or two.  Many people work through the day and the budgie does fine.  One budgie will bond more closely to you.  You can keep the t.v. or radio on so the budgie doesn't feel so lonely when you are gone.  Two budgies will most likely bond to each other.  Not all budgies get along, so you're best starting them out in separate cages.  Once they are out of quarantine and tame, you can try having them out of their cages and see how they get along.  Then you can decide if you want to keep them in separate cages or place them in the same cage.  <br>  <br>  If this is your first time owning a budgie, I recommend just getting one.  See how well you like the one budgie.  You can always get another budgie later.  That is what I did when I first started out.  <br>  <br>  Also, read everything you can about them so you know what you're getting into.  BirdTalk is a great magazine with plenty of information on budgies and all pet birds.  They sell it at most petstores, like Petco and Petsmart.  You can subscribe to it, too.  <br>  <br>  Budgies make great pets, in my opinion, and you'll probably want more.  I currently own 3 males.  <br>  <br>  Here are some links for more information on budgies:<br>  <a href="http://www.lisashea.com/petinfo/articles/bird_caring.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisashea.com/petinfo/articles...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.budgies.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgies.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.budgieplace.com/mf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgieplace.com/mf.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-magazines/popular-birds/budgies.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdchannel.com/bird-magazine...</a>|`|lYOy3I5qaa	Budgies are not the most expensive birds, but as you say you are out most of the day and Budgies need a lot of care and attention. They are also relatively easy to tame so it wouldn't hurt if you did get two birds. If you got two then your bird wouldn't get bored in the day. You can't really just intorduce another bird to your bird as they may not get along, its ideal to buy them at the same time. If you got them fromt he same breeder no you wouldn't have to quarentine them but if you got them from different breeders or petstores then yes, it would be ideal to quarentine them both, just in case! Good Luck!|`|PPBP6AGDaa	Definitely don't just get one. Sure it is harder work to hand tame two budgies, but perhaps you can rehome a couple budgies who are already hand tame. Trust me, you will enjoy watching them socialize together too.<br>  <br>  Good luck w/ your choice.|`|MstjbpVJaa	Don't even think about getting a bird.<br>  Budgie are a sociable and interactive bird,if you are not at home all day they will never get used to you.<br>  There is more than you seem to realise in keeping birds.|`|nn9bpWBZaa	eat it|`|bFl8bW9jaa	as with any pet, they need interaction. Budgies are no different.<br>  <br>  I would recomend 2 so that it does not get lonely.<br>  <br>  However the downside is they will not be very friendly either at that point. If you prefer handling, stick to one.<br>  <br>  As for cost. Full set-up should be less then $ 100.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Your idea is okay. Get the two budgies from the same breeder at the same time, and leave the radio on for them during the day and hopefully where they can see outside. Be sure to get a couple of toys and a cuttle bone and fresh water everyday.<br>  <br>  Just do what you are supposed to do. They are good company. Your thinking is okay. You're not a nut.
EnwYxbS4aa	I would try to get a real professionals advice for this issue. Someone who specializes in English Mastiff s. <br>  <br>  You are obviously an experienced dog owner in tune with your pup and clearly know the difference between  a play growl and a menacing growl and you seem very worried. <br>  <br>  I have had dogs all my life (although never a mastiff) and have never encountered a pup who growls in a threatening way.<br>  <br>  As you said yourself it is a big  worry as the dog is going to get very large so that is why I really would advise you to talk to an expert.<br>  <br>  Im sorry I could nt be of more help  - Good Luck|`|yPhCujOvaa	I'd say he is a little unsure if he wants to be touched and is being touched anyway.  Try to respect his growling and back off.  Always let him sniff your hand before petting him and try to analyze his body language.  If he seems to be inviting a petting, then pet him.  Since he is only 8 weeks old, he should warm up to you fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  Another possible scenario is that he had a traumatic experience when he was younger.  The breeder may have inadvertently hit him on the nose or something and he is being defensive because he is scared.|`|IowG78BGaa	does he bite?|`|nMe35c9Aaa	Mastiffs in general have very mean sound growls. I had a Napoleon mastiff he was about three when I got him. This dog was scared of everything, I mean everything. I don't know what the people before me did to this dog, over 150 pounds and a big baby, but when any one came near the house he let out the most frightening sounds you ever heard. Even though he would never have the guts to do anything. either way I wouldn't worry to much he's proudly just playing. I know alot of people who have diffrent kinds of mastiffs and all of them are very nice loving dogs. Just raise him with lots of love and attention and interaction and he should be fine.|`|T5ZAYYpNaa	he's only 8 weeks, so he doesnt know yet that you're in charge.  he growls you teach him no.  usually at young ages dogs dont like their face/ears/mouth/tail/feet touched because its strange to them.  but if you repeatedly do it and correct them when they have a reaction you dont like, they will get over it.  and honestly, you want to be able to do anything to your dog without a reaction from him, for safety reasons, as well as it just makes grooming/going to the vet SOOO much easier and less tramatic.<br>  <br>  our dog lets us do whatever we need to, put her in whatever position she needs to be in to do it and just sits there being the perfect little angel until its done.  and the vets LOVE her for it.  and cutting her nails and matted hair is a snap.  our new puppy is in training for the same thing too right now.  <br>  <br>  just keep at it.  touch his face (nicely of course) and if he growls correct him and do it again (and again and again and again) until he doesnt care that your're doing it.  remember it wont happen over night.|`|AA12083992	Are you sure it is not a pain issue? Maybe have a vet check him out?
5kK2f9Utaa	having 2 or more guinea pigs can help an inactive pet because they love to follow each other around. Mine are both on the living room floor right now but they're hiding in the pigloo because the cat walked in. Have things for them to hide in like boxes, paper bags, and cardboard tubes (cut down the middle so they don't get stuck inside). I had a towel hung up once and they ran around and around and around the towel because they were hidden on one side. It was adorable. You should also be giving your guinea pig a constant source of hay because it helps grind down their teeth. Most pigs look fat but really aren't, remember, they have lots of fur.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	get a puppy play pen with close together bars and let her roam... put newspapers down.. black and white only to soak up the pee pee... and give her things to hide in and run on... get her a thing she can climb up, only a few inches high. This will help. Cut down on Pellets and treats and beef up on the hay.
gPkb49ldaa	Most small animals such as gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice, degus, and other rodents are not affectionate towards humans. They don't cuddle or play with you like a dog or cat would. It's against there instincts.
AA10356572	not a sugar glider or hedgehog.. both are a lot of work.. especially the glider - tehy are social animals you either need to get LOTS of them or carry them with you all the time - and they pee all the time on you <br>  <br>  hedgehog will be awake at night<br>  here is my suggestion<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Usual-Pets-Rabbits.77863" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Usual-Pets-...</a>|`|EL6XhANlaa	Try a sun conure.

Easy to look after and easy to clean!|`|thImBQt7aa	It's too bad you can't get a rat. They make the best pets, in my opinion. I wouldn't suggest gerbils or hamsters, especially dwarfs, as they are solitary animals. They live by themselves and aren't very social. Hedgehogs are the same way.<br>  <br>  Sugar Gliders are very cool, but very expensive. They have a very particular diet, such as a vast variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as eating tofu. They also tend to get really attached to one person and can even become aggressive toward other people.<br>  <br>  Have you thought of a ferret, perhaps? They do have a musky scent, but all the ferrets I've met are very friendly and love to play. They are also solid animals, so you can horse around with them a bit and not have to worry about being super careful and particular. They do require a big cage, but other than that there isn't too much mantinence involved.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you chose! Hope it works out and you get a friendly, loving pet.|`|VVcEC69faa	before i finished reading you question my immediate thought was african pygmy hedgehog. we had 3 and the were very good pets. where abouts do you live? we had to drive from nearmanchester to edinborough to get ours and they were not cheap but when we got them they were cheap to look after and very entertaining. i too wanted sugargliders but i saw some videos on youtube that said they urinate everywhere and smell and that put me off. i would recommend a rat if you could get your mum to agree my rat was the best pet in they world, friendly clean easy to train and look after. how about a skunk? sounds wierd but the people who we got the hogs from had a pet skunk and they said it was friendly and clean|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I think a bird is a good idea (keep your cat away from it!). Hamsters are nice. Maybe a second cat. Exotic animals like sugar gliders are expensive to take care of and take up a lot of your time.<br>  <br>  By the way how are you "about" 12 years old? lol|`|XK9RLaPeaa	Well I definitely would suggest any kind of exotic animal (sugar gliders, hedgehogs, ferrets, etc). They are very difficult to take care of and definitely arent good for beginners. Parrots, and Conures are very hard to take care of too, and extremely noisy. If you can afford a large cage, a cockatiel would be a good pet. They are hard to take care of also, but all animals are. You should only get one if you are willing to spend lots of time with it, and have the money to spend on it (food, possible vet care, toys, large cage, etc). Also, try talking your mother into getting a rat. They are much cleaner than other animals, and they are very affectionate. Make sure to do plenty of research before you get a new pet. Good luck!

ymU9QGlUaa	She was probably septic from a retained placenta or retained puppy.  That is one good reason to see a vet post postpartum for a check up.<br>  And sometimes dogs feeding big litters can die form cardiac arrhythmias caused by hypocalcemia.  That might be the case if she wasn't eating.<br>  Without a necropsy, you will neverk know for sure.<br>  I'm sorry.|`|JsBb732Maa	You can get a necropsy done at your vets to see why she died.I'm sorry about your loss. :-(|`|AA10029366	Only a necropsy from your vet can tell you for certain.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	well if you want you can pay for the necropsy... foam is a common occurrence in sick dogs as well as DEHYDRATED DOGS... foam is the most prevalent symptom of Dehydration. I would really check and question if she was feed and watered properly. A nursing mom of pups needs water at all times. Its also a bad sign of diseases so I would be a little worried about your pups. I wouldnt go giving them to people just yet. Keep them 2 more weeks and watch them carefully. IF you can afford it, get them all in to the vet for a checkup. Add that to the price you are going to give or sell them for.|`|LjneV7LRaa	Did the vet say anything was odd when you took her in after she had the puppies? She should have had at least a couple check-ups since then.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	You might want to get the puppies checked out.

43eUq8hOaa	she could,but it is doubtful.I don't advise messing w/the babies too much,or she will.When some animals feel that their babies are being threatened,they will end up eating them.It doesn't make sense to me,but for them it is a defense mechanism.Good luck w/your hamster family!!!!!!|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Rodents do eat their babies in an attempt to accomodate her and the remaining children in a suitable space.

424db2308f435441cd3ebbb7d38327fdaa	If it looks like a cluster of little bubbles around the top edge of the water then it is most likely your fish's bubble nest (this means he's happy!).<br>  If it looks like soap scum (filmy, dingy, particles) then it means you need to change the water and clean the bowl.

JgC9a8m2aa	The most common color would be the sable, but DEWs are fairly common, too. At least, around here they are (I'm in PA and we're a pretty big ferret state). There's several pet shops around here that carry ferrets and I almost always see at least one DEW in the mix. I have a DEW. I also have a black roan mitt that is changing colors and will probably soon be a marked DEW (mostly white with a few grey patches) or maybe even turn completely white. I have another black roan mitt that's only 9 months old and is already starting to lose her grey, so I won't be surprised if the same happens to her. Anyway, I would guess that albinos are rarer than DEWs only because I don't see as many of them.|`|IIGUbf6kaa	<~~~ Like him? :D<br>  <br>  The pet store I got Edgar from does not carry any kind of white ferrets, Albino's or DEW (Dark Eyed White) ferrets because no one wants them and they sit in the store without getting a home for too long. So I asked if I could special order him and they said sure no problem. I gave them a picture out of a magazine just so they knew what I was talking about and had to prepay for him and after the exchange of the cash he was ordered and I went and picked him up the next day. They are a popular colour but no as common as some other colors. One pet store I tried to get him from said they had never seen one with a colour like his and the store I did get him from she said the lady had to look through three different litters of ferrets till she found him.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just noticed this question is in the rodents section, Ferrets ARE NOT rodents they are domestic carnivorous mammals who given the chance eat rodents.|`|WCNsmyZBaa	They arent extremly rare and they are called dark eyed white ferrets <br>  <br>  Call a breeder/pet store in your area and ask if they have one =3<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hugawoozel.com/colorings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hugawoozel.com/colorings.html</a>
7G0IyCltaa	First of all, I have to ask.... is she no longer beautiful to you?  Is she just something to look at, or does she have her own, innate beauty?  I'm hoping your going to say the latter.<br>  <br>  I know it's difficult to see what your bird starts to look like once they start to pluck.  We know something is wrong, and we want to make it all better, yet we are constantly made to feel like we can't do anything for our beloved friend.<br>  <br>  What you are feeding her is fine.  I'm sure it's better than what most people feed their companion birds.  Basically, what's good for you, is good for her, with the exception of a few items.  You can do a Google search for foods you can't feed to parrots.<br>  <br>  Feather plucking is a problem that no one really knows for sure why it occurs.  It can begin in any parrot, happy or sad, healthy or sick, active or not.  The common thought is that it either stems from a medical issue or behavioral issue, but no one knows with any certainty that either is the cause.  With that said, the first thing you must do is rule out any medical issues.  You can start out with some simple blood tests and cultures, and then move on to more complete blood work, Xrays, and diagnostics.  It will be expensive and there is no guarantee that you will ever find the cause or a cure.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, the plucking is just seasonal, and she'll go in and out of plucking.  If this is the case, I wouldn't worry too much.  As long as you know that she is healthy, by taking her to an avian vet, I wouldn't stress about it.  Any stress you may feel about her plucking you may transfer you energy onto her.<br>  <br>  I'd like to respond to the person who sold his parrot to a breeder.  I agree that parrots should not be pets, and should be left in the wild, as they are wild animals.  You may think your pet bird is like your pet dog or cat, but dogs and cats have had many generations of domestication.  Our parrots in captivity are only 1-3 generations from the wild.  HOWEVER.... they are here, and we need breeders so that we don't ever take another wild parrot from its home.  But giving up a bird to a breeder because it plucks is not a solution.  Most parrots that are raised in captivity don't know anything other than human companionshi, and often have a difficult time making the transition to breeder bird.  Breeders will tell you that your bird is plucking because it wants to breed, but plucking doesn't ever resolve itself in that situataion, either.  Often, it gets worse, and the plucker bird starts plucking the mate.<br>  <br>  I understand the strong opinion given by the answerer above, but I have to wonder who are you really thinking about when you say this.  If your intentions were first for the bird, why did you sell it to a breeder rather than give it to a rescue where it could be rehabilitated and rehomed?<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  "Put her out of her misery" of living in a cage?  In what, do you suppose she is living, now?  And all the little babies that she makes... what happens to them?  More to live out their lives in cages?  More for people like me to bursting at the seams with unwanted because of breeders and consumers?<br>  <br>  You can try to find blame and place it on someone else, but we all need to share in it.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	There are many reasons a bird could start plucking. It could be stress or an emotional problem possibly from having to deal with an issue it doesn't like, ie something happen at home?<br>  Another possibility that no one has mentioned so far, is winter.  Besides the less light, there is the dry air. I've known a few people who had their parrots pluck until they ran a humidifier.I don't know if that is the case for you, but it IS awfully  dry in my house.<br>  Just a thought.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	There are only two basic reasons a bird will pluck.   It's a health issue or it's behavioral.  Odd as it may sound, it's much easier to cure if it's a health problem.  The first thing you need to do is take her in for a check up with a good Avian vet.  It could be dietary or any other of a number of things.  But only a good Avian vet can determine that for you.  Obviously, if it's a health issue, you are on the way to getting it handled.  If all possible health issues are ruled out, then you approach it from a behavioral standpoint.  That can be the hardest cause to get to the bottom of because there are so many reasons that could be at the root of it.  But, to try to handle if from a behavior standpoint when it may actually be a health issue over which she has no control, will only stress her and you further and could drive her into more serious plucking.  You really need to act on this right away because plucking  can become a habit, even after the "cure" is found, if it has been allowed to go on too long.  It's like a human biting their fingernails.  If it become a habit for her, it will be next to impossible to get her to stop.  If she does it long enough to damage the feather follicles, then she will be bare in that spot for the rest of her life.  You want to get it stopped before she gets to that point.  If she has only just started recently, there is probably no follicle damage, YET.  Even worse than follicle damage will be if she takes progresses to the next step which would be mutilating herself.  Please get her an appointment right away for that check up.  Then you will know exactly which approach to take.  Best of luck to you with her.|`|KR78BbLDaa	sorry to hear about katie but this is due to one or more of a few things either your not giving your bird enough attention, your bird is being messed with by some one else, or you have recently moved, or someone she knows is no longer there. it has to be one of these because is is behavior only seen in captive birds not in the wild so start by paying more attention to her. oh and as for the table food that's fine as long as she doesn't eat lettuce, avocados, and a few other things. ps they can eat red meat just fyi. well contact me and let me know how shes doing i have a bird of my own and i have been around tons of others.|`|pDv13gJwaa	we had one that did that and we fed her top of the line stuff and played with her and she never did stop.. <br>  we took her to a good VET and over 2 years we did everything we could for her and then she started having behavior issues ... birds should not be kept in your house they should be in the wild.. I'll never own another bird, it's just wrong to watch them go through this. <br>  <br>  we sold her to a breeder (did I say sold??? we gave her away) <br>  <br>  edit 1 : to the person below.... we tried to give her to a rescue but they wanted us to pay them to take her... yes she was a she... we had her DNAd too.. did I mention the agressive behavior she started having.. ?????

OH and don't worry, it's been over a year and she hates all the male birds too. and I see that you understand my point of her STILL living in a cage to be driven even more insane.

4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	My daughter recently moved back home (as they do!!) and along with her came her 5 year old cat Ellie.  She has a scratch post, which lies redundant while she insists on scratching my leather furniture, tables, doors etc.  When outside, she scratches not the fence posts, oh no, that would be harmless, she attacks my wooden furniture and tables outside too!<br>  <br>  I shall watch this question with interest as we have tried sprays that are supposed to deter cats, tapping her on the nose when she approaches everything that she is about to attack and even putting her outside when she does it - which results in my outside furniture taking another bashing!!<br>  <br>  I too hope someone can help us!<br>  <br>  :)|`|u7vrul2Faa	Maybe the kitten was mistreated or not handled much when it was very young. If you bought her from a petshop she may have been kept in bad conditions. <br>   <br>  You need to see a cat behaviour specialist, your vet should be able to advise any to you.|`|4TX26viFaa	I'd leave a radio on softly during the evening to give her some sound stinulation.<br>  <br>  How about 'cat tv'?  A gerbil or hamster in a cat-proof tank will give her plenty to watch.  Or a bird feeder set up outside the window.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	She is bored & you are not giving her enough attention at the right times.<br>  You pay her attention when she scratches you & the walls - so she will keep doing it.<br>  There are sprays you can get which she won't like the smell of which will stop her scratching the walls & furniture (ask your vet for their recommendations or go to the local pet shop).<br>  Set aside time to play with her, stroke her & groom her every day - if she persists in waking you up by scratching - shut her out of your room.  It will take a few repeats - but cats learn fast that it pays not to get shut out of the comfortable places.|`|rSfoEyE3aa	try her with a few  balls of wool|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, I am a cat behaviorist..<br>  <br>  here is what you need to do...<br>  when a cat is fixed.. a girl is called SPAYED, male is called neutered.<br>  <br>  1. Get double tape at the pet shop to cover your favorite furniture, this is not harmful to your cat, and they will hate the sticky in their pay.  Double stick tape will not hurt your furniture. <br>  2. Get portable scratching post close to each furniture they used, if they see a scratching post, likely they will use it.<br>  3. Get their nail trim every 2 weeks. <br>  4.  When a cat start to bites you or scratch, say the word "NO" firmly, and move your hand or feet away.<br>  5. You need several times in a day for playtime to burn their energy...it will help them burn off those excessive energy!<br>  <br>  Adding to my answer.. buying toy isn't enough, unless you play with them.  Get them the string toys, where they cat chase it from one end of the room to another spot.  Their are so many toys out there that does not do a good job then a string.  <br>  <br>  hope this help!|`|nFNF0P7gaa	get a water pistol or anything that you can fire a little bit of water out of, any time you see the cat scratching anywhere it shouldn't be give it a little squirt. should stop after a while. as for the night thing just don't let the cat in your room when your off to bed.<br>  oh and try putting catnip on the scratching post that should make your cat more interested in it.|`|feUxjBbnaa	Buy this product called Soft Paws.  They go over the cats claw and stay in place with glue. I just tried it a month ago and it works great!  I just put them on the front claws.  I use them because my cat is attacking my other one and drawing blood.  Soft paws has completely stopped this now.  They are dull, so there's no way to dig their claws into anything.  I got mine at Petco.  I strongly recommend these now!  There is really no way to go wrong with it.  : )|`|w2bHPA7raa	my new kitten is like this. we put a bit of catnip on the scratch post to attract her to it and it seems to work.<br>  put tinfoil down near where she likes to scratch, cats hate this on their feet and they hate the sound of it so it should deter her|`|AA10892706	If she is an indoor cat and you are on the 4th floor, she is probably going stir crazy.

This is why she continues to scratch in the same places, and why scratch posts work once they become impregnated with the cat's claw scent.<br>  <br>  You need to temporarily conceal her claw scent by covering the places she scratches with something that has a smooth, shiny surface, such as sheets of thick plastic or aluminium foil. Another alternative is to disguise her claw scent by spraying those areas with something citrus scented. Feliway also helps prevent unwanted scratching because it mimics the scent found in their facial glands and cats don't generally scratch areas that they rub their faces against. (For this method to work, you need to spray Feliway once a day for 21 days on the affected area.) <br>  <br>  Cats have individual preferences for the textures they enjoy scratching. Not all of them enjoy using a scratch post because the sisal is wound horizontally around the post and most cats prefer something with a vertical thread. Have you tried offering her a few alternatives; corrugated cardboard, wooden log, heavy duty door mat etc., to see what she likes using?  Have you tried rubbing the post with catnip or spraying it with honeysuckle? Cats are attracted to these scents and can be used to entice them to scratch there. Another trick is to trail toys or pieces of string over the post so that they have to grab for it with their claws. Once they've done that a few times, they usually get the idea it feels good to scratch there. Because part of the desire to scratch is to mark territory, both visually and with scent, be sure to place her scratch items in areas where she already scratches, as it may be the location that is part of the attraction for her to scratch there. Reward her using it with lots of praise and food treats as encouragement.<br>  <br>  These links have lots of helpful advice on teaching cats to use a scratch post, trimming their claws and ways that you can protect furniture, wallpaper etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/scratching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/</a><br>  <br>  She's a young cat with a lot of energy to burn so you need to find ways to keep her both mentally and physically active.  If you can tire her out in the evening, she'll begin to adapt to your pattern of sleeping and won't wake you up at night to play.  Even though she has a lot of toys, do you set aside regular time to play with her every day?  Cats don't often play with toys on their own, they much prefer interactive games, especially ones where they get to practise their hunting skills.<br>  <br>  This article has lots of ideas and suggestions on ways to keep an indoor cat happy, which you may find helpful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/indoor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <br>  Be patient, she's in her teenage phase at the moment and will calm down as she gets older.|`|W5GYvyyxaa	The poor cat is BORED you are denying her a cats natural Instincts which  is to go OUT.can you imagine being sentenced to 20yrs locked in your house ,never going out in the sunshine to play.<br>  IM sorry but you have got a very unhappy cat that's not wanting to be a prisoner.For the cats happiness RE HOME and get a gold fish.<br>  I rescue and re home and unless the cat has a medical reason to remain indoors I insist they are allowed their natural instincts and go out.Just because you wanted a cat doesn't give you the right to lock it indoors for 20yrs,<br>  You at least get to go out of the house ,why deny the cat.?<br>  It annoys me when I read letters saying `I WANT` with no regard whatsoever to the animals wants!!!<br>  PLEASE DONT listen to DR KIAGCG its barbaric what shes recommending .Id declaw any idiot that thought it was Ok to mutilate a cats feet,,|`|mR5RkClpaa	well dont let cat in bedroom at night, leave her in a closed room [ with water and litter tray]  till morning in locked room. mine are in living room all night, as for scratching, this stops eventually.i have three indoor cats as i stay in a flat. they used to do this not now they are older, i have wall scratchind posts in hall and in living room, i have a few scratched walls, which does not bother me, but i also have my cats still one is 19, she will soon stop crying all night if left in a closed  door  warm room, , i am glad i kept my cats, , who mean more to me than walls|`|19MdPoaAaa	Hi I have had this problem many times before, most recently with a foster cat of mine called Meg. What I did for her and many before her is simple. Feed her at before bed as this will make her tired, and less likely to cry when you close your bedroom door. Secondly I bought a toy, brilliant toy love it to bits, from the local pets at home that is basically a laser pen that spins round and round on a 17minute timer. This burns of a lot of energy and is great fun to watch. To get her more interested in the cat post, you can buy cat nip spray for less than ￡5 which works wonders. Spray on to the scratching post to attract her to this, and to discourage her scratching your furniture and walls, there is a spray called "get off" available from pets at home that is brilliant. Not every cat will respond to it but in my experience about 80% will. If your cat doesn't respond to this try squeezing oranges or lemon on to the surfaces you do not want her to scratch. Cats don’t like citrus so this is a really cheap and simple thing to do.... I found by putting the peals under the sofa cushions it’s just as effective and doesn't damage or stain the sofa. With the biting ignore the behaviour. I don’t mean let it continue, I mean move away from her, or put her way from you. Don’t show her attention during this just say no and be firm, almost like giving her a timeout. once she learns that she will get the attention from not hurting you, and gets it for being a good kitty she will stop all of the biting, although cats will nip, very gently as a sign of affection (which is still not a behaviour you want to encourage), it is important to show her better ways of giving you affection like cuddles.<br>  <br>  I know you said a playmate is out of the question, this is a very good decision, and a second cat is likely to make her behaviour worse not better. <br>  <br>  hope this can be of help, but if not and you do decide to part with her, please contact a local feline charity who will arrange to take her off your hands free of charge, and can (if some cases not all) give you progress reports on how she is settling down. The cat I mentioned at the beginning Meg started out with all of the same issues, she is now a loving lap cat who sleeps through the night in her own bed and doesn't scratch people or furniture|`|9Xr1wQd6aa	When i got my kitten perdy she was a darling, followed me everywhere, cuddled me etc. She had my 100% attention. But when we got some new kittens she turned and became very jealous and didn't want to share me. To make sure she was noticed she attacked the kittens and wouldn't let me go near her. I dont know what to do with her. But she has her own space and a lot of my time and getting use to the kittens and hopefully getting better.<br>     I think with your cat she just neeeds a little more time.<br>  <br>  The main think is you give her attention when she wants it, if she comes when she is called then fuss her, but if she ignores or walks away then leave her she wants alone time. <br>  <br>  Is there any way she can go outside, staying indoors is never good for cats, they need the space to be a cat and hunt, play explore etc.<br>  <br>  Don't give up on your cat, she loves you no matter what she acts like. if she attracts you just firmly tell her NO, it is tempting but don't hit her, that will make her worse.<br>  <br>  Just giver her time and hopefully she will get better. Try letting her out every now and then, if you cant let her outside because of roads and the fear of getting lost then you can get a lead for a cat. It might sound stupid but if u get her use to it then u can keep hold of her whiles she runs around.<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  hope she gets better<br>  x|`|DumqzYnnaa	There's a few things you can do-- I've talked to my vet about this and cats are usually deterred by citrus scents. If you srpay orange and lemon scents where she is scratching, she is not going to want to be in that area.<br>  If your scratching post isn't secured to the floor [that is, it shakes or wobbles, or is a door-hanging post] she's probably not going to like the post at all. Make sure it's a firm secure scratching post first. <br>  If it is and she still doesn't like it, make sure it's in her favourite scratching places. She likes the couch, set it right near the couch. Rub the post with dried catnip leaves and play with her near it. I'd also suggest giving her a treat as a reward when she actually uses it. <br>  If she still uses it, loud noises and water bottles when she continues.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|M04TBx3Baa	I have 3 cats so I know by experience. You need to place maybe 2 scratching posts in different rooms. Also you need to watch her and as soon as she starts to scratch the furniture or bed take a spray bottle and spray her! That is how my cats learned. If she keeps waking you up at night buy a cat bed and place it outside the door to your room or by the couch and close your door. My cat slept on my face at night so I couldn't breath! All I did was close the door and now he knows if he sleeps in my room not to sleep on my face or else he gets the boot!<br>  Cats are very smart animals so if you start showing them what is right or wrong with water or something else they will learn.<br>  But also remember animals take a lot of time and work!<br>  But enjoy your cat, they are wonderful.

Personally, even tho I have been around my fair share of bullets, I have no idea how secure the casing is around the gunpowder and the chance of poisoning, and I doubt too many people in cats are going to know this.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Yes love, here are some ideas to start with.<br>  First off...do not feed the dog from a bowl.  Take the weekend and just hand feed only.  Have the bowl up and in your hand but do not allow the dog any contact with it.  Slowly on the third day put only a few curnals in at a time keeping hold of the bowl the entire time stating "e-Z (easy enunciated the way I wrote it)...then take the bowl to put a few more in.  Mess with the bowl by moving it while he is eating.  If he shows aggression take it away.  Continue this all day.  On the forth day put down a feeding and kick it around some while he eats.  The aggression should subside.  FYI - he probably went without food for a while...so the tendency to  survive is just a natural on that needs curbing.  Do not show anything but calm/sternness in your voice as well as in your actions.  Dogs pick up on any sort of tense feelings and they expound back to us in many forms.  Just take a few weeks of kicking the food...all of a sudden taking it away for no reason then putting it back.  Do many different types of actions so that he will be ready for anything.  Good luck...and be careful.  Food is a powerful motivator for dogs...even though who love us.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	They need to talk to a professional trainer that can observe the dynamics.<br>  <br>  They may find the book "Mine!" by Jean Donaldson helpful.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Feed her in a crate or a seperate room from the other dog and make sure there is no food in the yard or house that she can find and challenge the other dog.   Don't ever give them a high value item such as a bone unless they are both in seperate crates or rooms.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she has learned food aggression and none of her previous owners did anything about it.  She will probably always be food aggressive and may always resource guard.  As long as your cousin understands this and takes the appropriate action she will be able to manage it.<br>  <br>  The biting is another story and more serious.  They will need to get a trainer or behaviourist in to assess this dog.  She may be able to be trained out of it....or....she is a dangerous dog who should never have been put up for adoption.  <br>  I hope it works out for them.|`|CJMhtM7maa	I have to agree with The Dog Lady.Hand feeding is the best way,let the dog learn that it is your food you are giving it.

BdhoNlaLaa	My Golden Retriever did the same thing during her first heat.  She was fully housebroken and when she had her first heat she had alot of accidents.  We had her spayed a couple weeks after her heat which I definitely recommend you do, you don't want to go through this every 6 months.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Yes, it could.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine had a b*tch that would pee on her (the owner's) bed every time she came in heat.|`|9kTejB0uaa	It is possible that she's marking in the same way a male leaves his calling card.  This hasn't ever happend with my girls, even with their first seasons however, so I'd be a bit concerned  - it might be worth asking your vet just in case there's more going on.  Seasons don't affect bitches in the same way periods affect us apart from when they are ready to mate (around days 10 - 13 normally) when they get flirty and can be noisy if confined.  Some will say their bitches are more bad tempered when in season, but again, it wasn't the case with mine but breed temperament differs.<br>  <br>  Edit - where does it say she's had a UTI? (re the answer about more antibiotics needed)|`|U1RcZjqJaa	Yes, when my dog went into heat for the first time she had 2 accidents in the house. Obvious ones too, like we would be sitting on the couch and she would just go in the middle of the living room. I looked it up and I found that it was them trying to spread their scent around to let the males know they are in season. My dog never went #2 in the house however, but I would say that is most likely the cause!|`|KuUx34hCaa	it's doubtfully as I have never had ***** that was house broke have this kind of problem the BIGGEST problem is not taking her out as often  as you should  ever hour or more if need be I have had dog all my life& I do mean ALL now 70yrs & I have raised dog for more then 60yrs with my Dad's help|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	NOTHING to do w/being in estrus!!!!<br>  WHY wasn't it spayed MONTHS AGO????|`|0ymlYQvnaa	Yes, it is.<br>  Haa, i have a bull nose pitbull too.

She doesnt know what to do.<br>  but i got my dog pregnant right away.<br>  oh and you should breed her with another bull nose pit bull so if you want to sell the puppies you can sell them around 500-1000 ea.<br>  or cheaper if you'd like.|`|fSdeq7Xgaa	I would say that it could be changes in her body.

One thing to look for is one of those doggie "floss" things. It is made up of lots & lots of string that is tied in giant knots so that when the dog chews on it it is like flossing its teeth.

Ask your vet for suggestions next time you go, I wonder could something about her teeth be bothering her if she's doing this?  I used to screw up newspaper pages or pages from magazines & tie a string to them & my cat would chase it when I moved it along the floor.  Then after awhile I'd let her keep it & she'd always rip the paper to shreds.  Not really that messy to clean up as it's big pieces of paper.|`|kZrZCPRMaa	Yea i think she'll chew on it <br>  Because when i visit my cousins house and they have a dog i bring my cat with me and she uses the same litter box as the dog and also shares food and water with it even though she has her own food and water there(:<br>  <br>  its kinda funny.|`|AA10859773	You could try her on dehydrated rabbits ears and/or feet.<br>  <br>  For the dog chew toys or bones, you could try them but start with the smallest ones you can find.<br>  <br>  You could also give her chicken necks.

So I held onto that date and I will calculate his age from that for the rest of his life. <br>  <br>  With dogs who are neglected, it is sometimes difficult to be 100% sure of age because their teeth will age faster from lack of nutrition and care.  <br>  <br>  You can't always go by the "papers" your dog has come with, unless you bought from a reputable breeder, because mills and BYBs often falsify these papers (it is actually quite common and easy).|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	the whole 'dog years' thing is not true. the whole, multiply the age by 7 and you have his age in dog years is not accurate. a dog only ages 7 years to one human year for the first year of his life, then the rate slows down.  in actuality the dog is how ever old he is, if you dog is 5 he's 5 period. if your dog is 10 he's 10 period. if your dog is 14, 15, 16, he is 14,15,16. that's just it. there's no accurate mathematical equation to figure out how old your dog has 'matured' to in 'doggy years'. this is just something people have made up to explain why dogs have a shorter lifespan. the reality is, dogs have shorter lifespans and therefore age faster, but there is no accurate determination to figure out 'doggy years'|`|9WThresQaa	You mean the age in human years and dog years .

Cats are much safer and healthier when kept inside. If keeping him an inside cat is totally not possible in your situation, this pen seems like an okay compromise. But keep him in the pen. Outside cats face many many risks such as cars, wild animals, poisonous plants, bad weather, and so many other things.<br>  <br>  If he seems to like it where he is, why change it? He is much safer in the pen than he would be just on his own, although I will reiterate that the absolute best thing would be to keep him indoors.<br>  <br>  Because he was previously an outside cat, I'm going to assume he is neutered. If not, you need to get that done immediately!
gU34xa9vaa	Yes it's quite normal to those of us who also love our cats very much.There is a saying 'cats are people too' and a cat can give you as much, if not more love than some people can.Because you say he deserves as much respect as you and your parents, you are a person who truly loves and understands cats.Cats are living feeling beings just the same as us but because they can't talk the same language as us, some people look down on them as inferior.They are the ones missing out,they'll never know the feeling of the close bond that you have with your cat !|`|xNkmK0SHaa	"Normal" is a vague word.<br>  It is not unhealthy to love a pet, especially in such circumstances as yours.<br>  <br>  It becomes unhealthy if the time you spend with him and or the things you do with/for him begin to interfere with regular and necessary activities such as school, work, socializing with humans.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, no not at all.

So long as you are not choosing to spend your Friday evenings watching TV with your cat over spending time with friends and family, don't let anyone say anything negative to you about it. I loved my Shadow to absolute pieces. He followed me everywhere and used to beat up the stuffed animal cats I kept on my bed. If I was sitting down, he was in my lap. He slept on my bed with me every night. You are incredibly blessed to have such a close mutual attachment to Rocky.
Rx7wv4JLaa	No, not being fixed has nothing to do with potty training. If your puppy is marking that has to do with not being fixed. <br>  <br>  To be able to determine if your puppy is not house trained fully or if he is marking I'd need more info. How old is the pup? No pup should be considered fully house trained until 6-8 months old. This is b/c their bladders are still growing and they are still learning how to control and hold their urine. What have you done to encourage going outside? Praise and treats for going outside are very effective in encourage going outside. What do you do when he goes inside? Rubbing their nose or showing them what they have done can actual encourage them to continue to go inside. If you catch them going its best to just take them outside. IF you don't catch them you have to ignore it, they have forgot all about it, even 2 mins after it happened. <br>  <br>  Is he going to the same spot every time? This could be a sign of marking behavior. How do you clean the area? Use a cleaner with enzymes in it. Marking is usually just a small amount of urine in a the same spots.<br>  <br>  <br>  add: I didn't assume anything..i just explained what to do and what not to do and why. I didn't assume you were or weren't doing these. With a lack of information I explained the basics.|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	eh, sort of.  Fixing a male dog supresses testosterone in the system and makes dogs less aggressive to other male dogs and also less territorial.  therefore, a fixed male dog is less likely to pee indoors than an unfixed dog.  However, even an unfixed male dog can be housetrained to overcome this instinct, it's just harder to train an intact male dog than say a female or a fixed male dog, because neither the femal or the fixed dog has those same impulses.  Look into crate training your dog if you haven't already, because it's one of the fastest ways to train a dog where it is and is not acceptable to go pee.|`|30pY0wNgaa	male puppies usually mark there territory in early ages, you should get him fixed. some puppies do it and others dont.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Can't answer without any details, like how old your dog is.  Why not talk to your dog's breeder.|`|6CNhhTsDaa	Maybe it's because he isn't house trained?|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Neutering a puppy has nothing to do with potty training.  Marking just means that the puppy isn't potty trained yet.  My male dogs are not fixed and they don't mark in the house and never have.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.

But young puppies don't mark!<br>  <br>  What's happening here (and I do need to know his age) is more to do with not yet being fully housetrained.  Do you use a crate?  If you don't I strongly recommend you get one.  However, first of all you need to rule out a medical problem if he's going that frequently.  He may not be able to help himself, so any amount of 'training' isn't going to stop what he's doing.  Normally I'd suggest you take him out, and if he doesn't go, bring him in and crate him, leaving him for 20 minutes or so, and then putting him back out again.  This way he gets it fixed in his mind that you don't appreciate him peeing all over the house!!<br>  <br>  But from what you say, he is peeing outside, and then coming in and peeing again indoors?  In this case, again depending on his age (at under 8 weeks, he will do this, he's a baby - over 14 weeks, he should be starting to be able to hold for long than he apparently is), I do think you need to have him checked by your vet - take a urine sample with you.|`|AA10500537	sounds like you;re not leaving it out long enough. try a bit longer <br>  having it fixed has nothing to do with it.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Have you potty trained him yet?

Is it on a chain all day?  If it does not have food, water and shelter every single day that it is back there then this guy is liable to be turned over to the humane society.  I guess i would inform him that yes even though he is the owner he cannot do anything he wants to this animal.  The dog must be cared for a hundred percent or he will lose it.  But you will need to be the person to either talk to him about this or to turn him over.|`|vvdc5EnTaa	The only law about leaving a dog outside is the leash law. If he has a gate, then that serves as its "leash" in the eyes of the law. If the puppy gets out of the fence like you say, then there may be something the law can do to make him fix the fence. But thats a far stretch. As long as the dog is kept in a fence or on a leash, then theres no law against it that I know of. And it doesn't matter how old the dog is. Sad but the only thing you can do is call the police station and ask them yourself because hey, the law might be different if you're in a different state than me.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	I've called the Humane Society about our neighbor's dog being chained to a tree 24/7 and they said there is no law against it.  They said as long as the dog has food, water and shelter there is nothing they can do about it.  It breaks my heart to see that everyday, day after day.  <br>  <br>  I'm so glad you can play with the dog when you can.|`|58gmJ58vaa	It is just a dog...If it has food and water and shelter then he is doing nothing wrong. Not paying enough attention to him is not right but there is no law against it. Mind your own business. Really not meaning that rude but would you want your neighbor sticking his nose in your life and trying to get you in trouble cause you don't play with your dog enough.|`|NiYIPrkQaa	Unless the dog is being abused, mistreated, starved, etc. there is not a whole lot you can do. If you really want to know i would suggest contacting your local SPCA and explain to them the conditions the dog is living in. If they feel it is bad for the animal they will intervene.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Depends on where you live and your municipalities regulations. In my area (a lot of farm land) nope. But, right across the street from me is a whole different story. You must provide shelter from the elements, water and food and they are only allowed to own two dogs per household.. It doesn't say anything in my area..|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Many cities have laws on care for dogs. Check with your local ASPCA or Humane Society. At the least, they need food, water, and adequate shelter.<br>  <br>  I hope for better laws than those basics in the future!<br>  <br>  If that is all you would give to a child, it would be neglect.<br>  <br>  Doesn't a loved pet derserve better care? That sucks!|`|Xtqq71KGaa	if the dog is in no danger, i doubt any law is going to stop him from leaving the dog outdoors.  unless maybe a neighbor files a noise complaint.|`|yyIVrngcaa	i hope there are...<br>  <br>  what;s the point of having a dog if you're going to neglect it? :/|`|26991c1ba20b717681957ed25b316eacaa	call your local animal control officer, they can help you.|`|gjRtGhvmaa	I don't know about any rules, but that's just horrible!

You need to check your city ordinances and ... if you happen to live where there's an HOA, they might have some rules to cover that too.<br>  <br>  I know in my city, you can't have your dog out in the yard if nobody is home.  A great amount of people still do, but there is an ordinance against it and if someone were to complain about the dog, the people would be fined.  My HOA has a similar rule and tops that off with having certain hours.  The dogs cannot be out in the yard unattended between before 8am in the morning and after 10pm at night.  You can run them out for a bathroom break during the off hours, but they cannot be out there alone.  <br>  <br>  I've heard a lot of people say they think my HOA is a pain in the butt, but I actually like that rule.  It keeps people being responsible for their pets and aware of the affect their pets might have on their neighbors.<br>  <br>  I can't believe some people are so ignorant as to not know that each city can have different laws about these things.  If you own dogs, you really should look up all the laws in your area concering dog ownership.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If the dog is escaping then the owner needs to fix the fence or he'll be held liable for any damage the dog does.<br>  <br>  Just because he leaves water doesn't mean he's caring for the dog.  Is there a shelter that will protect her from wind/rain/sun/etc?  If it's cold, is there a heater available?  Does he leave food outside for her and replace it when it's not eaten or gets wet?<br>  <br>  If he's not spending any time with her he doesn't need her. The point of having a dog is to have a companion...not a lawn ornament.  If he wants something to adorn the lawn get him a gnome. :)<br>  <br>  This is a young dog that craves human company, needs socialization, needs training and needs someone to properly care for it.<br>  <br>  Call your local SPCA or police department and tell them what's going on. They'll send someone by to check on the situation and if they don't approve they'll take her away.|`|E9SnGrzWaa	Usually it isn't a problem, but one of my neighbors did this and their dog barked 24/7. So I called the police and the police issued them a warning and it wasn't a problem anymore. I'm not sure if this only applies to barking dogs.|`|AA10283080	Check your local and state laws.<br>  <br>  Most states require that a dog have adequate shelter and food and water available. Sadly states don't require much more than that for someone to own a dog.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	They have to provide food, water, and shelter, and shelter can be a back porch.  Most places have laws against chaining dogs.  If you catch the puppy and give it to animal control, they will just give it back to the owners.  I have the same problem where I live.  My nasty neighbors dogs are even left outside in ice storms and there is nothing I can do about it.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	No laws about outside unless it is very cold.<br>  <br>  AS for not having food or water I would call animal services and have the dog checked on. They may remove it form the home if they find negligence.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	There are laws/ordinances that state dog must have adequate shelter, access to food and water when outdoors for long periods of time.<br>  Contact the SPCA nearest you.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	If he is providing proper shelter, fresh water and food then it probably OK by most humane laws. Sad but true|`|cNUsxCOWaa	Most cities have their own laws/ordinances regarding leaving animals outside. You could call the Humane Society/SPCA, but more than likely they will tell you to call your local government agency (Animal Control) and they can help guide you about what is legal or not. <br>  <br>  Outside of cities, there may be some laws, but you'll have to dig a little more. A good place to start is Animal Control. <br>  <br>  I live within city limits and are there ARE laws about shelter, food, drink for any animal left outside for longer than 8 hours per day. There are also laws against keeping dogs tied/chained for a certain number of hours per day outside. <br>  <br>  Honestly, it depends where you live. Again, start with Animal Control, Humane Society, local SPCA and they can guide you further.|`|e1z8pHfmaa	Not as long as the dog has food and water and isn't being subjected to other cruelty.<br>  <br>  Being left outside is not cruel.... unless you are talking about leaving a Chinese Crested outside in a Minnesota winter or something.<br>  <br>  Most breeds... with the exception of toy breeds and other lap dogs... are perfectly capable of living their entire lives outdoors.<br>  <br>  I have to agree with the previous answer.... some people tend to humanize dogs... and think that the dog is experiencing human emotion.  I assure you it isn't.  The dog might seem "sad" but dogs live very much in the now... and as soon as the owner returns she will immediately be "happy" again and forget all about being alone.<br>  <br>  It just isn't your business to tell your neighbor how to raise his/her dog.  If the dog is healthy and well provided for... then there is not cruelty.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  After reading some of the answers I have to reiterate.... it is the people who think ALL dogs belong INDOORS who are the idiots here.  Guard dog breeds do just FINE left alone to do THEIR job at night.  Dogs like the Great Pyrenees were BRED to be left alone to guard flocks of sheep.  It borders upon lunacy to think that dogs with mastiff bloodlines (i.e. HUGE dogs), herding dogs, hounds, and other HUNTING dogs were EVER meant to be indoor dogs.  Only in the last hundred years or so would anyone EVEN THINK of having such a dog INSIDE.<br>  <br>  Now it has come full circle... and people are so attached to their own dogs that they forget that being inside defies the very nature of many breeds of dog.  <br>  <br>  My advice:  talk to someone who owns a Husky or a Malamute... and see what they say about leaving it indoors when they go to work... and note their chewed up couch.<br>  <br>  Sillygirl has the most sensible answer.... the entire POINT is that we are talking about dogs not people.... and the comparison of dogs to humans has no validity AT ALL.  As one answer said "if this were all you were to give to a child... it would be neglect."  Well, sorry but what a stupid answer... it IS a dog and should be treated LIKE a dog.<br>  <br>  My response to that point of view... if this were a horse... leaving it out all day by itself would be considered PERFECTLY normal... and horses are herding animals...they like company too.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	" forgot to mention that she (the dog) is so lonely.

AA10356572	Petting zoos are usually a side business only.. <br>  <br>  its extra income..<br>  you might raise sheep.. and keep the bottle feed ones for petting zoos.. you might have hens for egg production and keep some friendly hens for the zoo.. but it WILL NOT pay your entire bills.. <br>  <br>  here is a good link about starting a petting zoo<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Rural-Living/Starting-a-Petting-Zoo.123921" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Rural-Living/Sta...</a><br>  one key is to focus on unsuall or endangered breeds - these you can also sell for more $|`|cY8DgJv5aa	A petting zoo wouldn't be all that profitable.  People can go to the zoo for things like that and probably pay less than you would charge.  Also, in this economy, people aren't paying to do things like that as often as they use to.  Just a regular ol' farm would be your best bet.  Raising or growing some kind of product to sell for a profit.  Surely you realize its not that simple though.  Things like this are more of a gamble than a guarantee.  There's no way to guarantee that you'll make a significant profit.|`|RT8LZy7gaa	You really can do both.  We have a couple farms around us that raise produce but also have a petting zoo type set up for schools to bring kids in, etc.  It's very popular around easter, halloween (for pumpkins and hayrides), etc.<br>  <br>  You could raise the chickens and let the kids collect the eggs (if the chickens are nice), teach them about how a farm is run on a basic level (we raise the produce to sell and feed the animals, etc.).<br>  <br>  I wish I had this type of set up!|`|1zK8yMD7aa	On their own neither is extremly profitable but if you were to say have a petting zoo type farm and grew your own food along with the hay to feed the animals. You even could have an amount of space set aside to grow flowers for sale. Together you have a good possibility of making it.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Petting-zoo type wouldn't be profitable.  The best idea is probably to start a dairy farm, but it is hard to compete with big factory-farms.<br>  Horse farms can be either profitable or unprofitable, you need to be experienced to make it work.|`|dCewrtXaaa	Petting zoos are almost always free, but they can be a great attraction to draw people in to other profitable enterprises such as a farmer's market with your own fresh produce, eggs, maybe even goat cheese; hayrides, pony rides, pumpkin patches, etc. You can even sell little feed packets for people to give the animals in the petting zoo. Be sure to have liability insurance, though, in case anyone gets bitten or kicked.
4aAhEK9daa	LOL at Chigwell's response!  We definitely don't take kindly to people breeding their animals.  Cats actually breed more often than dogs.  A female cat and her unspayed litter can turn into FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND more cats in just seven years if she and the litter - and their kittens - and so on and so on - continue to breed.  With dogs a mother dog and her unaltered litter it's "only" about 70,000 more animals.  Still staggering numbers but nowhere near the cat figure.<br>  <br>  But as per your comment about mixed breed dogs - a whole other thing is going on there.  Backyard breeders are mixing breeds and then giving them cutesy names - Maltipoo, Shorkie, Schnoodle, Pugglet, etc.  We haven't seen this yet in the cat fancy... knock on wood.<br>  <br>  BIG difference also between an intact male dog running around an an intact male cat.  Intact male dogs are known to be more aggressive than neutered dogs.  How often have you heard of an unaltered cat attacking someone or killing a neighbour's cat or dog?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that either of these are ok just that there's different issues between cats and dogs.<br>  <br>  On that note, you wouldn't be asking this if you weren't breeding mutts so please stop.  Every litter you allow your dog to have - or to father - is that many more animals put to death at your local shelter since you're taking homes that would have gone to them.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I'm not in that group - all mixed breed dogs AND cats should be neutered/spayed and not bred on purpose.  Its called "responsibility".<br>  <br>  On both the Dog and Cat sections, I only recommend breeding for show quality animals - if your cat/dog can't compete and is not show quality or mixed breed animals, they should be neutered/spayed as young as possible.|`|4TX26viFaa	It's an issue.  Especially with ferals, which is why people talk about TNR.  You can cover all the loose cats in the neighborhood this way and stop the birth of litters.|`|pw8u5WQ9aa	Irresponsibility is irresponsibility wether it is a pet owner of a cat or dog. These animals are being put to sleep in shelters.|`|Qw7ymfakaa	LOL<br>  spend some time on here .....believe me we dont let them get away lightly !!!!|`|x0WZE0i4aa	For me responsible breeding means making sure parent animals are free from disease and genetic problems, and only breeding enough to keep a stable population (which means not all females, whether dog or cat, can have litters).<br>  <br>  I don't believe breeding moggies and mongrels is irresponsible.  Mixed breed (or in fact no breed in the case of many cats) animals can be wonderfully unique.<br>  <br>  Also breeds only exist because someone drew up a list of standards.  It's not the word of some breeding god: just another human being who's idea of what makes a good animal is no more valid than yours.<br>  <br>  There are also problems with breed standards.  In many cases they are leading to more and more extreme and unhealthy animals.  For example, Cavalier King Charles spaniels suffer from an extremely painful brain condition thanks to the shape of their skulls (and there are dogs with this winning shows and standing at stud...).  Bulldogs, along with breathing difficulties, can also have spinal deformities linked to their curly tails (I've seen an x-ray of a crufts winner with a bent spine).  The ridge in Rhodesian Ridgebacks is actually a mild form of spinabifida, and some of these dogs can end up with holes into their spinal cords.  It's not quite so bad in cats, but the extreme flat faces of 'show standard' Persians and Exotics can lead to problems breathing, eating and with tear ducts. I've also heard of some modern Siamese with jaws that don't work properly, or born with eyes on the side of the head, due to the changing head shape of this breed.<br>  <br>  A further, related problem with only breeding 'the best' is loss of genetic diversity.  Apparently in spite of there being many thousands of them, Cavalier King Charles now have the genetic diversity of only 100 individuals.  If in each generation only 'the best' is bred from, and (especially where studs are concerned), they father large numbers of litters, you can easily get a situation where a major sire fathers a large percentage of a generation.  And then when a genetic fault turns up you are in trouble...<br>  <br>  It's sort of ironic, but it may be that in some cases backyard breeders have actually been preserving some good genetic material that would otherwise have been lost.  Personally, I like Siamese.  But I like them as they were when I was a kid.  Not the extreme dumbo-eared look you'll find winning all the prizes... I'm glad to say some 'renegades' have kept older looks alive: both the type now classified as 'Thai' (which is not quite what I'm into either), and the elegant but not extreme cats I like.  There's a similar situation with Persians.<br>  <br>  Anyway... I believe in the interests of genetic diversity, that even 'the best' according to breed standard should have their breeding restricted.  And we need some breeding of all sorts of cats and dogs.

5v5pyjfGaa	-- This page provides the 'basic' care for tarantulas. There are many species, each of which require their own unique type of living conditions, this guide will work well for Grammastola rosea (Chilean Rose)--<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Housing Enclosures<br>  Most species should be kept singly in a given enclosure. Arboreal tarantulas (tree-dwelling tarantulas), prefer enclosures that are larger vertically, whereas burrowing or ground dwelling tarantulas prefer a wider based enclosure.<br>  I use plastic cages with locking lids or plastic shoe boxes. I stay away from cages with nylon screening because I have had spiders that were actually able to chew through the screen! Kind of scary when you sleep in the same room with your spider collection. <br>  <br>  <br>  Ground Cover<br>  The ground substrate I use most vermiculite or a mix of 50% vermiculite 50% peat. I think that a mix is better for burrowing tarantulas because it holds its shape better. My Hysterocrates gigas creates large burrows and likes to dig around. When I was using straight vermiculite it would cave in on him all the time. When I switched to a mix the burrows were stronger.<br>  I would not recommend using anything with fertilizer in it, try to find sterilized peat or potting soil. I've heard that you can sterilize substrate by micro-waving it but I have never tried this. I change the substrate after about 4 - 6 months of use..or until it starts to get nasty. <br>  <br>  Humidity and Airflow<br>  Humidity is an important factor in keeping your spider alive and healthy. Air flow plays a factor in keeping down molds and fungus. For most species misting the cage a few times a week will be adequate. Some species from wet tropical regions will require a higher humidity level. If the amount of humidity is too low there is a chance that when the spider molts it could split it's exoskeleton(skin) and bleed to death. Don't keep your cage wet, just humid. Usually misting the cage every few days with a spray bottle will be sufficient. Hydrometers can be used to ensure a more accurate measure of the relative humidity.<br>  Some plastic enclosures I've bought had over-ventilated lids which I scotch taped (from the inside so the spider can't get stuck to it) to keep the humidity up to acceptable levels. This doesn't always work because some spiders will chew it off within a few days.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Temperature and Heating<br>  Most tarantulas should be kept at temperatures between 75-84 degrees F. In the summer I don't worry about heating except for especially cold days. In the winter I use a small space heater to heat my spider room. If you don't need to heat an entire room, heat rocks and heat pads are a way of heating a single enclosure. Don't leave your spider in direct sunlight for any extended period of time. A spider's enclosure can overheat rapidly! <br>  <br>  <br>  Shelters<br>  Tarantulas should be provided with some type of shelter. Even though you won't see your prized pet all of the time, it will be much happier. Spiders like to hide in the wild and leaving them in a bare setup is very unnatural for tarantulas. I provide all mine with rigid plastic tubing (PVC) 3" - 5" or pieces or cork bark. <br>  <br>  <br>  Feeding<br>  I usually use store bought crickets. Although I've used many different wild caught bugs, some people frown on this as prey items caught outdoors may be contaminated with pesticides or mites, but so far I have had none of these problems. Occasionally I'll offer small "pinky" mice to large spiders. Spiderlings may need tiny crickets, or even fruit flys which can be bought at specialty pet stores. Some species prefer two or more medium sized prey rather than larger meals. As a general rule, insect prey fed to tarantulas should be 1/4 - 1/2 the length of the spider body. If your spider doesn't capture it's prey within 30 minutes or so it usually isn't hungry, or is too stressed, remove the prey and offer it again at a later time.<br>  <br>  After feedings there are usually parts left over from the prey that the spider cannot digest. Tarantulas will sometimes wrap these parts in a small web ball, remove these and any leftover parts from the spiders' enclosure. If not mold and fungus can become an unwanted problem. Some tarantulas don't eat as often as others, especially if kept too cool.<br>  <br>  Tarantulas stop eating a few weeks before and after a molt. I've had some spiders that went months without feeding for no obvious reason. So don't get too worried if your spider has somewhat strange eating habits. <br>  <br>  <br>  Water<br>  <br>  Tarantulas get most of their fluids from the prey they digest. I offer all my spiders a shallow water dish which I occasionally see them drinking from. You may want to put something in the dish so crickets don't drown, I use small rocks.

f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	I commend you for fostering! I would first get another vet's opinion. If she is on a special diet for her stomach, then it's pretty clear that it isn't working. If you are feeding her in the evening, try switching her to the morning or try several small meals during the day. <br>    A crate might help her as well. It is possible that she is not happy being locked in a bathroom. I can't believe a vet would suggest to lock her in the bathroom all day! Hopefully he is not a parent.  Beagles are very pack oriented dogs and need companionship. <br>    I adopted a badly abused beagle years ago. Maggie was a wonderful dog UNLESS she was left alone for any length of time. She destroyed 2 windows in my bedroom one night while we went out to dinner with the kids. It looked like a woodchuck had been there. Another time, she pulled the bottom of a steel door up like she had used a can opener. Our problems ended completely when we adopted a beagle pup. .....until Clancy learned to open the refrigerator...|`|AA10500537	go to  a pet store  or walmart and buy a crate  and keep it there at night,<br>  they wont pee and poo  where they sleep.<br>  good luck|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its not the walk that she needs for house training purposes.  You need to revert back to the basics.  She needs to have one general area where you want her to relieve herself.  Eventually she'll learn that every time you take her to that spot, you want her to relieve herself (she'll smell her own scent every time she goes there).  Taking her for a walk doesn't necessarily tell her exactly what she's suppose to be doing.  She's just walking and enjoying the sights and smells and doesn't understand that the walk has a purpose.  All it is is exercise to her.<br>  <br>  Crate training would be a wonderful thing for her.  She's pooping all over the bathroom floor because there's plenty of room to do so.  Dogs, by nature, will not poop in their own beds.  A crate is just enough room for their bed, so they generally won't relieve themselves while in there.  In the bathroom, she has plenty of room to poop in one area and sleep in another.<br>  <br>  Also, considering her age, if she's never had any training and has spent her whole life pooping and peeing wherever she wants, its going to take quite a bit more time to correct that.  Taking her outside to relieve herself every 2 hours is a very smart thing to do.  No need for a walk every single time though.  Just take her to the potty area and let her sniff and do her business.  Generally speaking, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.  Other than that, if you aren't able to fully dedicate yourself to her potty training as often as she needs it, then perhaps this dog would be better suited with a different foster family.

That means you have to get out and walk your dog in rain, sleet, snow, ice, heat, etc.  They require responsibility -- you can't just leave them at home for the weekend if you want to go away.

This also means they eat less food and require a smaller tank for proper care. These snakes are fairly calm and are generally very good eaters (in case you don't want to have to worry about tricking your snake into eating). <br>  <br>  They also can be kept in many environments, so they are less likely to get ill from an improper environment (but a responsible owner should try to keep them as comfortable as possible). <br>  <br>  Care Guide:<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/cornsnakes/a/cornsnakes_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/cornsnake...</a>|`|yZcrhyzlaa	A newly acquired snake should have its feces and/or vomit examined for bacteria, protozoa, and worms. Signs of a bacterial infection or endoparasites are listlessness, failure to eat over several weeks, or regurgitation of meals. Left untreated, infestations can not only kill your snake, but can even be transmitted to humans. Collect the feces or vomit in a clean plastic bag, and seal it. Label it with your name, phone number, date, and your snake's name. It is best to have these tests done by an experienced reptile vet.  Snakes cannot digest food if they are dehydrated. If the skin around the neck is wrinkled and forms puckers, it is severely dehydrated. You must then see a vet immediately. Early treatment is the best way to avoid serious and expensive problems later on. Ectoparasites such as ticks and mites can also be fatal. Mild infestations may be dealt with yourself, but if the snake becomes dehydrated or the infestation is severe you should see a vet. Removing a tick with tweezers can be dangerous because if the head stays embedded in the snake's skin, infection almost always occurs. The safest way of removing a tick from your snake's skin is to cover the tick's body with petroleum jelly, especially the head. The tick will be suffocated until it is forced to let go. When it does release, remove and destroy it. Note: Since ticks can carry Lyme disease is safer not to come into direct contact with their fluids (don't smash it between your fingers). <br>  <br>  With mites the safest removal method is a long warm bath, in a few inches of water for several hours, or until you see the mites fall off and drowned in the water. While the snake is soaking you must completely disinfect the entire main enclosure. Clean everything meticulously, and throw out anything you cannot clean, such as the substrate.
Amkmles0aa	(1) buy a cat box<br>  (2) call vet and ask<br>  (3) see that stay are get biger<br>  1980|`|NJfpY7nIaa	1. Each cat should have it's own litter box. There's also a chance that the litter boxes you already have are dirty...so he doesn't want to use it. Cats are very fickle about their litter box....I would be too if I had to use one.<br>  <br>  2. When they are weaned and when the mother is dried up. Milk being left in the mother is very bad. <br>  <br>  3. Just make sure you are supervising and that the mother is doing everything(feeding, stimulating them to go potty, ect). Also keep an eye on if any of the kittens are displaying any odd behavior...if so, call your vet.|`|ojETaOHdaa	1)  There's your answer.  You should have 1 litterbox per cat and an extra, try getting two more boxes.  (after ruling out any medical issues of course.)<br>  <br>  2) After they are weaned.  So, when they start eating food on their own, like soft canned food, at about 4-5 weeks.<br>  <br>  3) To be safe, you should feed the kittens KMR (kitten replacement milk) every 4 hours if you can because sometimes some kittens don't get to a teat, or get pushed away.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ugk1DMOkaa	well for the third question, make sure the mother cat gets all the nutrients she needs. i had a cat who had kittens who developed a calcium deficiency from feeding her kittens all the time, she then started fitting and becoming disorientated and went missing a few times. ultimatley she died from it after about 6 months. so make sure she has plenty to eat and drink!|`|QWiqt5VFaa	aint got a clue x|`|P9S5wlLyaa	In response to the first question: First of all, if you have three kitties (or 8,  because soon you'll have to count the kittens), you should have at least three, preferably four litter boxes. The rule is, one more box than the number of cats.<br>  <br>  Also, if the male is neutered (the male version of spayed), he isn't really a tom cat.<br>  <br>  When he poos on the floor, pick up the poo and put in into the litter box. Don't just garbage it. Also, as I said, make sure you get at least one more box. most importantly, make sure you clean all three boxes every single day. It sounds like he's a clean kitty who understands that poo should be covered with litter.<br>  <br>  Wait till after the kittens are weaned to spay the mum, but keep her inside until then, obviously. Good job on getting her fixed as soon as possible!<br>  <br>  Take the babies to the vet relatively soon, to get their first check-up. Call the vet and ask when would be the best time.|`|FcevFNMUaa	1) Every time you see it going on the floor pick him up, bring him to the litter box and say "no." You'll have to repeat this until he learns properly.<br>  2) Wait until the kittens are done feeding off their mom at least. If she goes and gets spayed then the kittens are left with no food and will probably become stressed and frightened. <br>  3)As for the kittens, they'll be getting very curious and opening up their eyes soon. you'll need to make sue that there being monitored properly, so they cant get hurt etc. make sure that they are all getting enough food from their mother, and that they all have a safe and warm place to sleep.|`|2s97jFrtaa	I called our vet because I had my cat spayed while she was in heat. I didn't know you could do that. He said the best time to get the cat spayed is 12 weeks after she had the kittens. That way they have the 6-8 weeks to become independent of the mom and she has an extra 4 weeks to get her body going the right way. If you wait more than 4 weeks tho' the chances of her getting pregnant again are higher.<br>  For the third question, just make sure that all of the kittens are getting the milk. We had a cat and she wasn't very big and she had 8 kittens! Dive of the kittens ate REAL good and they kept pushing the other 3 out of the way. We actually had to take the 5 kittens and and hold them back so mom could get the 3 little ones fed better. We couldn't take the 5 bigger ones and put them in a separate area because then the mom would get up to go look for them so we just held the 5 back away more so the 3 little guys could eat.

She loves the attention and it's funny when she jumps. I know that sounds stupid, but to see two or three teenagers chasing a tiny dog around the house IS pretty funny.<br>  <br>   We also have a pit bull named Gracie... She is hallarious on her own. Her name makes it even worse because she is NOT gracefull. My boyfriend and I like to lay in bed and call her name and then hurry and put the covers over our head. She seems to get confused and runs & jumps on the bed. Then she sniffs around and whines like were gone (even though shes usually walking around on top of us). <br>  <br>  Another story about Gracie.. Because she is a pit bull people assume she is mean and a "fighting dog" HA! Well someone was warning us that they were scared of dogs and we were kind of just like, "oh no don't worry, She's harmless" but then they saw her and freaked out! Of corse Gracie decides she wants to play with them... So she picks up a bright green sock and starts prancing around growling/barking at them with a SOCK IN HER MOUTH. <br>  <br>  She makes a mama proud =)<br>  <br>  Gracie also likes to get "dressed up" but we can't find any clothes that fit her (shes a tad over weight).

I won but he got his revenge in finding the largest mudd hole he could find to do the Rottweiler poop dance. <br>  <br>  4 towels later I'm getting my coffee and they are having their morning, after breakfast snooze, not to be confused with their mid morning snooze, which is right before their noon snooze.<br>  <br>  But today is visit the butcher day, I will have no trouble getting them in the car for that.<br>  <br>  Ya' gotta love um right??|`|sMBuotwZaa	I have 2 cute stories...<br>  <br>  My Dachshund who is a mini will let me know when wants something (usually its asking to chase a leaf or stick in the yard) he will cock his head to the side, and lift one leg up and look at me.  If I tell him he can go get it he will so excited that he wags his whole body till he almost falls over and then will take off across the yard after whatever it is he saw.<br>  <br>  My Aussie will get so excited when you come home from work or school, or when we picked him up at the Kennel that he does what we call "Waggle Butting" because he doesn't have a tail he just wags his whole back end. He will waggle his butt and then Leap up in the air (never on a person just straight up) But one time he did this outside, and came down on a patch of Ice and then slid down the driveway.  He just hopped back up and came bounding  back to us.  He is in his Awkward puppy growth stage.|`|sW8eg01saa	my younger mini dachshund when we tel her to roll over she did it once then the second time she just went on her back and wiggled around. she also looked like a bat because her big ears flopped out she kept doing it because we could not stop laughing then she finally got bored and started running around like a speeding bullet. (and she hurts if your on the floor and she is running real and hits you on the head she could give brain damage doing that lol)|`|DDFSITiYaa	I have an english setter who is by breed, a bird dog.  He loves to watch out the windows, especially now that the weather has recently warmed and birds are about.  My windows are low enough that he can easily stand and look out and I open them a few inches.  But he is at it so long, he gets tired - if he sits, he is too far back from the sill and can't put his snout out to the screen.  So he tries to lay down and rest his head on the sill but it is then too high for him to comfortably reach.  It is hilarious to watch all his attempts to continue bird watching and rest.  He usually gives up and goes and takes a nap.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	My dog will watch tv. She will get whine at the dogs on tv and birds because she wants to play with them. She will run up to you and lick your face when I'm trying to tie your shoes or put my boots on. She will also act like "dead weight" when I want to get up and she has her head on my lap. She runs up with her toys and squeaks it in my face trying to get me to play. Once she tried to mimic the cat and jump on the window sill, needless to say she fell down really hard and didn't do it twice. I was glad that I was a witness to it. She will sit pretty without asking if she smells bacon or cheese in the air. I find she does something everyday..|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	Bruiser is lab x some sort of bully breed. And thinks he's little enough to fit in someone's lap. He knows "ready, set, go," and on "go," will take off, even if he has no idea where he's going. He watches you when you dry your hands because he LOVES to teeth on wet paper towels. Oh, and he chases grass. He LOVES it! If you rip up some grass, he'll hit the ground like a sack of potatoes and wait for you to throw it. And once you throw the grass, he goes after all the little pieces. ^-^
prDXnwV0aa	I don't know much about growing algae but it always seems  to grow best in the warmer months. Hope this helps.|`|R3E8DkTfaa	If you are having trouble growing algae in your tank, then you are doing something right, not something wrong.  No matter what you do, you aren't going to get enough algae growth to support your algae eater completely.  You are going to have to continue supplying supplemental feedings anyway, so I wouldn't recommend that you make the necessary changes ( such as poorer water quality) that are necessary for algae to thrive.  I would suggest that you leave your lights on for longer than 6 hours a day.  Think about it, how long does the sun shine during a day.  A lot more than 6 hours unless you are in the arctic circle during the dead of winter.  Most of the fish we keep in aquaria are tropical where the sun shines even more than it does here.  I would recommend more like 10  to 12 hours of light a day.|`|SeVyIfQ6aa	usually people try to avoid algae, if you want it just let the sun shine on it, and check your PH, keep it neutral or close to it, and make sure you de-chlorinated your water, they sell stuff to do that|`|SGyaz4rsaa	you need sunlight, and a good chemical balance otherwise it wont grow.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	All algae eaters should be supplemented with algae wafers and veggies. You cannot depend on what is produced by your tank. The presence of algae is not something you want. High levels of ammonia and decreased oxygen levels are very bad for fish.|`|mOayTJDmaa	Any light will grow algea.  The longer you leave the light on, the better it grows.  But you don't want the fish to have too much light.  Heat also helps, but be careful not to over heat the tank.
oDVx7nSxaa	It's perfectly safe to spay a cat in heat.  There is increased flow of blood to the uterus at this time, so the vet needs to exercise extra care while tying off the veins and arteries, but this is something a good vet should be doing anyway.  Call and make her appointment now, as she may cycle in and out of heat, making it very difficult to schedule an appointment both for when she's not in heat and the vet has an opening.|`|gU34xa9vaa	As she's been in heat now for a few days, it will only be a few more days until it's over, so if I was you I'd make the appointment for about a week's time.Cats usually do lose more blood when spayed in heat and it's not worth the risk of anything going wrong that way.<br>  Maybe you could just keep your cats apart meanwhile ? <br>  Well done for planning to have her spayed now !|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes she can.  Some vets may charge a bit more for the surgery. Cats can go in and out of heat almost on a continued basis and its hard to pick a time when they are not.<br>  <br>  Get her spayed asap so she doesn't get pregnant again.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	It depends on the vet. Some will spay during heat and some will not. You will just have to talk to your vet and see if they do or don't.<br>  <br>  Female cats can go into heat and get pregnant as early as 4 months of age. They are usually in heat for 7 to 10 days at a time, and will go in and out of heat every week or two until they are mated or spayed. While in heat female cats may leak a clear liquid from their vaginal area, however they do not bleed or have a menstrual cycle. If your cat is bleeding or having any discharge other than clear it is an emergency and your cat needs to bee seen by a vet asap. <br>  <br>  It is best to spay and neuter all cats before they reach sexual maturity (as early as 3 months to before 6 months) to avoid pregnancy, deadly pyometra (uterus infection), urine marking/ spraying, discomfort to the cat and the annoying behavioral issues that unfixed cats, both male and female, display. <br>  <br>  Please Spay and Neuter!<br>  <br>  The average number of litters a fertile cat can produce in one year is 3.<br>  <br>  The average number of kittens in a feline litter is 4–6.<br>  <br>  In seven years, one female cat and her offspring can theoretically produce 420,000 cats. <br>  <br>  Only 1 in 12 of those 420,000 cats born finds a home. :o(<br>  <br>  Even if you found homes for all your cats kittens, you are still taking away homes that other already homeless cats could have had by adding to the population.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Yes, but many vets will charge more because "the organs are engorged with blood".<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, from observing surgery on a cat in heat, we are not taking massive amounts of blood. The uterus & ovaries are only slightly enlarged & if my vet had not told me the cat was in heat I would not have known the difference.<br>  <br>  When you call for the appointment tell them exactly when she came into heat & ask their suggestion for a surgical date. I would think the chances are good that she will be out of heat by next week - especially w/ the neuter teasing her.|`|kZrZCPRMaa	Well i had my cat spayed just 2 days ago but she got a liver check and all the before the surgery i don't really know if that makes any difference but its either based on your cat or up to the doctor because they said my cat and most of all the other cats were in heat also and they all got Spayed/Neutered<br>  <br>  So most likely yea they can(:|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Many vets will spay a cat in heat. It's a bit more complicated and expensive but it can be done.  Some will prefer to wait, but many will do it.  Our humane society routinely does cats in heat all the time.|`|eKOgRHa6aa	I would just wait but keep her inside O_O. Don't worry if it's a neutered male. So just wait till it passes then make an appointment because I'm pretty sure not many vets will do it when they're in heat.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	There is a higher risk of bleeding if done while in heat, due to the ovaries swelling,so for this reason vets may refuse.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Some vets will, some vets won't.  The only way to know is to call your vet to ask.  There are some medical issues when a cat is in heat  but I am not sure what they are, but ultimately its up to your vet whether or not they will do it.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	call your vet<br>  make an appointment<br>  <br>  most vets won't do the surgery while she is in heat, it just adds to the dangers of surgery. some will do it asl long as you hear their legality lecture before she is admitted.
XmJZkFuMaa	I hear what you're saying.  I for one wish more people would treat their dogs like kids (not babies, kids with strict rules.)  By putting them on strict rules we fixed almost every behavior problem that came our way.  Dogs want to see who's the parent, and want to belong to a family.  <br>  <br>  At the same time, you have the people who are so into dominance training that they misinterpret every lick, bark, growl, etc.  Someone on here just a week or so ago on one question told a woman that if the dog lays his head across the baby's lap then he's dominating the baby and that is dangerous, when I can tell you that my dog will roll all over my daughter to initiate one of their games, or will nuzzle his head into her hand or lap for the same reason he does to us.  She's 15 months.  He's so careful not to hurt her or pin her, and if she yells out he moves away fast afraid he's hurt her.  There's no dominating going on.<br>  <br>  People read a book or watch Millan working and think "Oh, that applies to EVERY dog EVERY time."  Millan even misinterprets behavior and that doesn't help teach people.  <br>  <br>  Example: Dogs have no guile.  They're not sitting and plotting to take over the world, starting with walking through the door first to prove to you who is mastermind.<br>  <br>  I blame bad trainers or dog "experts" in the world, not the people.<br>  <br>  Add:  Oooo... Bluebonnet hit another annoyance of mine.  I met someone who met my dogs and immediately started trying to do "wolf behavior" at them.  He claimed he had a wolf spirit.  My dogs were telling me he was crazy and were avoiding him like the plague, hiding behind me or trying to get away from him.  Yeah.  I do believe dogs communicate, but people just read too many books and think that's their guide to communication, or else internalize it too much.<br>  <br>  FYI, I actually love to dress up in a costume and entertain folks.  I don't try to portray dog behavior in costume.  That's impossible.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Thats Normal|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	This really sets me spinning.   A dog has canine behavior & does not display human behavior.<br>  <br>  Some people even dress them up like humans, so sad.  Most people know nothing of canine behavior & just apply human behavior to their dogs cause they don't know the difference.  It is just plain ignorance.  <br>  <br>  As a past trainer it was the people that would not accept the training & would mess it up every time.  Every time.  They just don't know anything about the animal they have as a pet.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  If an owner has scant/no knowledge of canine behaviour, breed traits & drives, then they may well misinterpret their dogs behaviour.<br>  <br>  Anthropomorphism is one of the causes of behavioural problems is canines. A dog needs to know its place in the pack & that is at the bottom of it & to be given boundaries which are consistently applied. There is nothing wrong in having a great deal of affection for a dog, but you do it a diservice if you don't treat & respect your dog for what it is.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I treat my dogs like dogs and humans like humans.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	No, I've never put my children in a kennel run.|`|aQgswKFiaa	Yes, but as long as the owner is not experiencing behaviour problems, it should not matter. <br>  <br>  Dogs sometimes DO misinterpret humans, so by changing SOME of the ways in which humans act we can lead them back on the right path.<br>  <br>  And I do not think for a second that dog's emotions are the SAME as a humans, but we simply see it as that!|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Having had multiple dogs most of my life I think that I consider myself more of a pack member than my dogs being human.<br>  Yes I agree that many people take it too far, but for the most part I myself tend to treat my dogs like part of my family.<br>  When I train my dogs in public so many folks think it`s funny but do tend to ask me if I train children as well.<br>  Another equalizer would be when losing one of your dogs to an illness which I am presently doing myself.<br>  I know I`m going to mourn and grieve the loss of my boy as I am already having a very difficult time just watching him wither away and waiting for the time to be right to send him on his journey, does this sound like I treat my dogs like human`s, you bet it does!<br>  I have already lost more than I care to think about over the years and it never gets any easier. I morn, grieve, cry and still try to persevere just as in the loss of any family member human or not.<br>  So yeah I guess I do tend to make them feel more human than anything else, guilty as charged but I would not want it any other way.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|NJfpY7nIaa	I don't get this "treating them like humans" stuff.<br>  I treat all my babies like what they are...my companion.<br>  What you and your companion share between you is not for me to judge...every relationship is unique. If I want to share my popsicle with them or talk to them about that show on T.V. last week...I will.<br>  Also, some dogs do get angry at their owners for leaving them for a long period of time. I've seen it happen.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	People personify their pets .  It is only natural.  They have their own emotions and get mad, scared, happy etc just like us.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	I find anthropomorphism creepy as well as just plain stupid.|`|L58kCPSxaa	yes, but it is true. they do act alot like humans|`|c6be05aa1037ec72ee650198ecd67aa9aa	Yes of course. That's stupidity.|`|AA10500537	my pup is a big part of my family and i wish everyone would.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	I do think some people take it too far, but most do not. I believe that a dog should be treated like a part of the family. I treat my rats like they are my own kids. They are just like a little dog. I also treat my dogs like they are my family. I don't know what I would do without my pets and I love considering them part of my family.|`|1fjhg6j4aa	A woman in my office told me that I couldn't possibly love my kids as much as she loves her dogs because she's had her dogs longer than I've had my kids.  <br>  <br>  So, my answer for you is Yes.  Dogs aren't people.|`|B9gLdAkHaa	many owners do because their pet becomes part of the family.|`|UWGACx1Jaa	WHAT?
hEXb1unraa	The problem lies in at your age its probably NBD its not like you are hanging out your shingle saying Im a pro.....but you do need to remember that if you have lots of people willing to pay you money...then word gets around and if you starting winning in Amateur and or non pro and someone decides to complain about you, then you might get in some issues.....people can be weird and all of a sudden success comes to an individual and then people start to talk...Oh ya I paid her to ride my horse...such and such...so its a fine line to walk.....  case in point is Mandy McQuay...how this woman maintains her non pro status being married to a pro trainer and her dad being a trainer.....so depending on the Association...Like AQHA I would adhere to the rules because you do not want to lose that amateur statis|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Sounds like you are in a pickle :)<br>  That is something you are going to have to decide on.  You will either have to get a job elsewhere or ride for money and loose your amateur status.  I would say start looking for a job if it is really important to you to stay an amateur.<br>  You can always turn pro in a couple of years. I would say take advantage of your amateur status for now.  I don't know if this helps at all, it is ultimately up to you.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|h7AYFmZIaa	Since you will only be 15, I would suggest you maintain your Amateur status.  I understand showing horses can be very expensive but once you lose your Amateur status you are placing yourself in a category against other trainers that will have more years and experience under their belts.  In the long run, if you were to become a professional trainer, having points as an amateur will help to justify your fees.  So my vote would be to keep riding and showing as an Amateur and get as many points as possible...then go pro in your late teens early twenties.|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	I'm currently fifteen too.  I don't accept money for a service unless someone offers.  If someone is to offer you money I would accept it.  Plus you are not really training horses you are only riding them for people.  Training is when you are actually teaching a horse an action.  I've been training thoroughbreds since I was thirteen and have never accepted money for it but that is just me.  For the work i do with them I should be paid.  I do what's called gentling with young horses.  The sooner the exposure to all sorts of things is my moto.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	You don't say what you are showing in.. but speaking for AQHA shows.. I would definitely keep my youth/amateur status.  AQHA shows are vicious, and if you do not have a $3000.00 saddle on a $50 thousand dollar horse, you do not have much of a chance. It is way too political.  To me it would be a waste of money.  I would continue in amateur and keep building up your experience.  Then go on to be a trainer or even a judge, where you will earn much better money and make a name for yourself.<br>  HOWEVER, if you do not show in registered shows and only show open, they don't care if you train or how good you are,  You will be in youth or open classes.<br>  I wish you the best in what you decide, I just think giving up your youth would be a mistake that you won;t be able to ever get back.  Once you go pro/open.. it takes 5 years to get it  back then it will be too late to enjoy the youth.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I remember having to make that decision back in 1980.  I'd been an amature until then.  If I rode a horse for someone, or broke and trained one, it was out of the goodness of my heart at that point.  Then knowing my favorite QH was getting older and because I was short of funds I had leased him out to a gal and he came back navicular, I needed funds to buy and care for another horse.  August, 1980 I began giving lessons at Pegasus Ranch for June Martin.  It's addictive!  It's REALLY nice to be able to walk into your favorite tack shop (Mine being Broken Horn) and able to take out a roll of $20.00's.  <br>  <br>  It's your call.  I was in my LATE 20's when I finally gave up my amature status. You are only 14, you've got 4 more years of showing youth and you can still learn MORE.

18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	All three dogs are wonderful breeds. And I'm sure you will make a fine mommy to them.<br>  <br>  I would, however, not start out with three dogs - get one - you pick which one - and add them one at a time (unless you have no choice) That way you can be flexible with whether you can afford to have three dogs at once - like emotionally, financially, physically (all three dogs are larger breeds) etc. etc. <br>  <br>  Remember to maintain that you are the pack leader and will not tolerate challenges to that authority. That is key because one dog or another may feel he/she is top dog. Nope. YOU are top dog. Even if it means you have to be more than firm, maintain that you are top dog.<br>  <br>  Take all three to obedience school. Like children, there is nothing nicer than a well-trained dog - and there are few things worse than a poorly trained unruly dog.<br>  <br>  But add them one at a time (unless they came as a pack from a relative or something like that). That way you can assess whether you can add another to your family.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Why are you asking advice if you disagree with what you already know people will tell you.

You can get whatever number of dogs you want, as long as your city/town has no ordinances on the number of dogs that can be kept in one home.<br>  <br>  Getting one dog or puppy, and letting him or her mature and be trained before you get another one is a good idea.   No dog will suffer by not living with 2 other dogs right off the bat.   Dogs can pick up both good habits and bad habits from each other.  Having one dog reliably trained before you get another is just good sense.|`|VHk7ihSdaa	I don't think owning 3 dogs is a good idea for anyone unless you own a large piece of property and are dedicated to hours walks everyday.

Each dog has its place in the pack and each has a personality. With your previous experience you should be ok, but if there are problems, research via the web should help initially.

3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	My heart goes out to those of you owning shelter dogs, i realize they need a good home as with any dog.<br>    In my state almost every single shelter dog is a large breed, not very often do you find a small breed in them, if there is those are the first to go. I personally have never owned a shelter dog, the reason is cause like i said most dogs in the shelters around here are larger breeds and i think those dogs should be out in the country not living in the city, also i like to have my dogs as pups so i can train them the way i want them to be, and i will better know their personalities them growing up with me. With shelter dogs you don't know how they were treated or trained as they grew into adults so they could have some nasty habits that are very difficult to break. Not saying that all shelter dogs have bad habits mind you. Plus you don't know what they can tolerate and what they can't.<br>   I guess its a personal preference for me to own a dog as a pup so its raised around me and i will know it basically from the inside out. Getting a shelter dog your basically gambling and im not a gambler..lol.|`|zeTGmB3faa	I guess it is the stigma attached. And I bet that most people who believe this have never owned a shelter dog. I agree with you. All of my pets were either shelter pets or strays on the street and I have never had a problem.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	I know what you mean - it is so frustrating when people automatically jump to this conclusion.<br>  <br>  I think it is simply that they assume that dogs are dumped or surrendered because of a problem with the dog - rather than a problem with the owner. Most people don't realise just how many dogs end up in rescues because of genuine changes in circumstance - eg job loss, divorce, ill health or death of owner etc.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong - I know many rescue dogs do have some issues, at least to start with. But the decent rescues do a behavioural analysis of all new dogs and get them vet checked. Any health or behaviour problems are dealt with before the dogs are put up for adoption. Most rescues are also very specific about what homes they need depending on the dog - eg can't be homed with kids, can't be left long periods etc.<br>  <br>  I think if people go to a reputable rescue group, and are honest about their circumstances, they could find their perfect dog.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Well considering that most of them have been left there or abandoned there must be a reason. We got a shelter dog and he shredded our house to pieces every time a stranger came into the house.<br>  This was originally the reason why his previous owner had gotten rid of him.<br>  <br>  I guess that's the stigma that travels with shelter dogs. 'There must be a reason why they are there in the first place'.<br>  <br>  It's probably only a small percentage that actually comes with behavioral problems.|`|7rx3sdehaa	Well, there are always ignorant persons who believe dogs that people do not want must be in poor health, or have behavioral problems. <br>  <br>  While this is entirely true, there are plenty of shelter animals who do have these problems. For instance, I intentionally adopted a 15 year old dog with many, many problems - but regardless of his health or age, he was a fantastic dog the time I had him. <br>  <br>  I adopted him because I knew not many people would want him because of his health and age. But there are plenty of shelter dogs that are top notch, in their prime of life without health or behavioral issues. Some of the sweetest dogs I've encountered were sitting in a little pen in a shelter.|`|AA10500537	news to me  i think anyone that gets a rescue dog should be praised and many of the dogs had to be turned in cause the owners could no longer keep them.;<br>  i have gotten  wonderful dogs from  rescue places,|`|w9aR8ymGaa	that would be like saying all of the children in foster care are there because of their own faults and that their parents did everything right but it was the kid that was bad.<br>  <br>  I have always adopted and I am always praised on how well behaved my pets are.  Of course, I also take the time and energy to train them and care for them correctly where I sincerely believe most people do not.<br>  <br>  The part "Marley" in "Marley and Me" was played by several dogs - all rescues.

In my experience anyway!|`|nkEEQtmEaa	Some people cling to their biases, and they just plunge forward with them, no matter if it's an animal or a person.<br>  <br>  If they were to do a little research, they would find they're wrong, but it's too easy to come up with a cop-out excuse.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	My shelter dog was crazy when I got her. I had the leash on her and almost took her back. Lucky for the dog my wife talked me out of it. Ive had her ten years now and she is a pretty good dog, but she is still a ittle nutty.|`|asp4DaiHaa	just cause they arent well bathed..i dunno
3sB49YNnaa	If she is 5 months and bred, she shouldn't have any excess risk for being either too young or to old.  I would get the male out now if you are worried about your sow.  Any sow at any age is at risk from being bred.  Somewhere between 5 and 20% of all sows die as a result of pregnancy.  It's a fact of life that no amount of care will make go away.  Unless you have a very good reason for wanting to breed her, and "having babies would be cool" isn't one, you should not subject your pet to the risk.<br>  <br>  There is added risk putting a sow in to breed for the first time after 7 to 9 months and that risk increases with age.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	It is always dangerous to breed guinea pigs! To avoid complications, the guinea pigs should be of certain ages to breed. The female should breed before she is 6 months and the male should be at least 4 months. Remember though, there can be up to 10 babies and they are a lot of responsibility. A lot of times one or more of the babies are stillborn. Take the male out of the cage one the babies are born, he may eat them. I wouldn't put him back in withe the female or the litter because the will mate with the mother again or with on of his offspring.|`|gVQ6es5Taa	She may or may not have problems, but you cant abort them so you will have to wait and see. They are pretty resilient, they breed at that age in the wild so it should be fine. <br>  <br>  If a male is in there, she probably is pregnant, they breed from a very early age. <br>  <br>  You can never put the male back if you dont want babies... they will breed over and over several times a year for the rest of their lives if you keep them together. Which is really bad! Plus the male will probably hurt the baby guineas. I advise you rehome him or get a separate cage.|`|juyA6HUJaa	Why did you have a male and female together anyway ? Unless they're neutered threres no doubt in my mind she isdefiantlyy pregnant. Don't put the male with the female at all unless you want a lot of babies and by the sound of it you dont sound experienced enough or have the room for that. At any age guinea pigs having babies can be a problem they're only small animals and the babies are very big. If one gets stuck she could die.. and so could her little ones, don't be so irresponsiblee.|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	If she is pregnant then she will cope on her own if she isn't then it is still advisable to keep her away from the male guinea pigs are prolific breeders and she will turn into a baby machine and eventually will be unable to cope. if you want to keep more than one piggie the male needs to be neutered or get more females they will live as a colony.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Rodents do two things..eat and mate.  She will always be pregnant if she lives with a male.|`|QWiqt5VFaa	Take them to the vets, because i sort of had the same problem...<br>  I bought 2 guinea pigs from a breeder and they were both supposed to be girls. Then the guinea pig that actually is a girl, had a baby. We took the guinea pigs up to the vets and found out one was a boy, the other a girl. Now the girl is pregnant again and we got the oldest boy neutered and soon, we will get the youngest boy neutered.<br>  :) x|`|AtSDPHPiaa	She is just about too old to get pregnant. It isn't that safe at the age of 5 months as her pelvic bones will have started to fuse together at 5 months, which means there could be complications when she gives birth. A good idea would be to get your male neutered. Take care with her if she is pregnant.|`|vQWZx5Yuaa	i bought a guinea pig that was allready pregnant lol..<br>  got four little baby guineas =]|`|3MwiahfJaa	right first of all, take the male pig out whether she is preganant or not, because 1/ if shes not already pregnant she will end up soon and 2/ if she is pregnant he wont hurt the babies (as far as i know) but just after she gives birth he will try to mate her again, n its very bad 4 a pig to be preggers and raising babies at the same time. they get very stressed out, and sometimes end up abandoning their babies because they are too tired to care for them. <br>  <br>  if she is already preggers, beleive me, you will notice before she gives birth, becasue they end up looking like they are set to explode (rubie did anyway), and when she gets bigger, you will be able to feel the babies fidgeting about if you have your hands still on her belly.<br>  <br>  im not quite sure what ur asking about the age so il tell u all. b4 the age of about 7months its not advisable they get pregnant bcoz they are not fully grown, and mature enough to look after the babies (not all pigs though, in generall) and after 14months-ish id say it'd be too late for a firrst litter because her hips would have fused n it may be difficult 4 her to give birth. i reckon between 9-11 months is a good age for them to have their first babies. for the second lot id say give her about a month or 2 AFTER the first lot have left her, so she has enough time to recover from them.  ermm, if u need anything else let me no coz my guinea pig had babies n i should be able to help you with anything else. lol<br>   im sorry this is really long but i wish someone had told me when rubie had her babies. after they are born feeed them extra because the babies can eat solids from being newborn (they still need milk though)<br>  sorry about the bad spelling, n if i sed 'pig' i meant guinea pig. lol

You could get a rescue for $300, so maybe $250. He's nothing special, he's just like every other race horse that comes off the track.<br>  <br>  His bloodlines don't mean crap unless you want to race him. He's also been line bred which isn't very common for Thoroughbreds. He has Nasrullah, Bold Ruler and Bold Bidder on both sides. <br>  <br>  If he's two and he already has bad front feet he's most likely going to be a train wreck by the time he gets off the track.|`|3bzaDhReaa	In england and Ireland horse farm owners are aborting and killing foals at birth because there is no market for them.  They are also trying to get another slaughter house going to take care of the brood mares that are out of business because of the market turn down.|`|RoPLmd2daa	To be honest, very few horses are worth that much right now.  You can get a well-bred and fully trained horse with good conformation practically for free due to the economy at the moment.  And the fact he still has his balls should make his price cheaper, because you'd end up paying more to geld him or keep him separated from mares and other horses.<br>  <br>  So unless he has an absolutely incredible show record and near-perfect conformation, he should be gelded.  Even after being gelded, he wouldn't be worth more than $5,000 (tops). Again, I'm not dissing your colt or anything, but the way the market is, it's impractical to ask $10,000 for an unfinished OTTB stud.  And like most OTTBs, he will get arthritis early in his life, and require retraining to be used for anything other than running in a big circle.|`|T9ZOckCjaa	right now he isn't worth 10K. Has he ever been on the track? if so has he won anything? that would add to the value. But from what you've said and seeing the picture he isn't worth it. Also you have to take into account the down economy/horse market.( I'm assuming you live in America) How far down is it in your area? a good way to find out is look at horses that would have been worth 10-20K before the recession and see what they are worth now. You are stuck in quite the situation, one that I've been in before. You have been training him for quite some time, chances are you know him inside out, and it seems that he has really taken to you. You two have a bond with each other by now and you are probably very attached. yes, there are other horses, but there is not another one of *this* horse. Try to reason with his owner, you trained him, right? see if you can get the owner to come down on the price. If you can't have him right now, start saving for when he comes off the track. divide your earnings, half for the colt, half for other things. You may find another horse, but probably not. I know how you feel I fought my mom for 5 long months over a $1500 horse! The last thing is the hardest one to do. Take a step back and look at him objectively. What are his faults? Is he slower than the others? What conformational flaws does he have? I'm not talking about things that can be fixed, but the ones that can't. Also, ask your self if you can afford to take care of him. can you feed him? shoe him/get his feet trimmed? Can you afford the vet bills? After that, if you can afford it and if you still think he's worth it, which you probably will, see if, and when you can scrape up the money.|`|qNuynJNLaa	Well to be truthful I wouldn't say he's worth 10,000 Well I would pay it, if you think one bad front hooves can cause a BIG problem in later life as all the weight is upon them, then he's skittish, this is something he can and proberly will get over with the correct training, if he's been started under saddle at not quite two years this could cause him problems in later life, I know alot of thoroughbred are under saddle at around 2 but this can cause back problems in later life, even if he has minor problems now you need to think of what could happen in the futer if I was you for as colt like him i'd pay no more than around 6,000 possibly 7,000 if I had to but at the end of the day it's down to you, thats just my thought on this.

Z9zzNYNCaa	None of your criteria is breed specific-except the bird-dawg part & that fits any number of Sporting group breeds.<br>  <br>  <br>  Weims are *NOT* anywhere near the top of *any* SAR list! <br>  SAR is for PROS,dear,not civilians wanting to pway K-9.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Weims are not generally used for SAR. But they can do it because they do have an great nose almost as good as a bloodhound. <br>  <br>  I have 3 weimaraners and they are not for the inexperienced owner. They have very high energy and must be walked every day even in the winter. A good run is also a must. <br>  <br>  You really should some research on your own to see if the weim will fit your lifestyle, maybe foster one first there are plenty in rescue that need fosters. <br>  <br>  Weims are really smart they can outsmart a human. For that fence you must have a locked gate because they can let themselves out. They are chow hounds so over feeding is a problem. Never and i mean never free feed or leave food out all day. Have scheduled feedings. Weims get bored easily and a bored weimaraner is a monster specially a puppy. They need mental stimulation everyday, now this could mean planting birds to find or just playing with interesting toys. <br>  <br>  Good luck in your search and dont listen to deadgame|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Weims absolutely need to be walked each day. They are a very high energy breed, and they need to be exercised each day until they are tired. For a young dog, that will likely take several hours. A weim that doesn't get enough exercise will likely develop all sorts of behavioral problems. <br>  <br>  Also, weims are large and strong. I would never recommend leaving ANY dog alone with children as young as yours. Supervision is always required with children that young, and you need to teach both the children and the dog to respect each others' boundaries. <br>  <br>  Also, weims require a lot of training. They are smart dogs who will do whatever it takes to get what they want! They need strong owners who are not afraid to assert their dominance. You do NOT want a dominant weim in your house. <br>  <br>  So basically, if you have any doubts whatsoever about getting one, I would not recommend it. <br>  <br>  What I would recommend INSTEAD would be a trip to a local shelter or rescue where you can interact with the dogs there and see which would be a good match for your family. There are dogs that are perfectly fine with a couple short walks a day and some running around a fenced yard with the kids, but weims aren't one of them.|`|M6bb0Z7waa	T-Rod, I haven't had any problems with my weimaraner.|`|118h96Q8aa	Weimaraners are a wonderful breed. They are intelligent, loving, and very loyal to their family. However, in the first two years of their life, they are extremely hyper and playful. They tend to jump around and play a little rough--They're a large breed, so they don't realize how rough they're being sometimes. Of course, with steady training early in life, this is easily deterred. They need tons of exercise and are a good hunting breed, so honestly it sounds like you'll have a good set-up for them. I couldn't think of a better home set-up. :)
wuQCq0e8aa	trust me. your dog IS peeing.  somewhere hidden.  look under your bed, behind the furniture, and anywhere else you don't normally go.<br>  <br>  but yeah, your dog will be coming out of heat (aka period) soon. it lasts for about a month.  call your local SPCA and find out how you can get her spayed for little cost to you, maybe even free!!|`|nctxHm8Qaa	How extraordinarily clever.

A2IDiIpIaa	Rats (like most rodents) will almost always breed when they "meet" a male.<br>  The best way to see if she is pregnant is time. <br>  In around 2 weeks from the day of conception she will start to look like a pear. Skinny at the head, fat at the bottom.<br>  The gestation is around 20-24 days so by that point you have around a week to go.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped|`|30pY0wNgaa	Usually her stomach will get bulgey and usually if she is nice enough you can feel her stomach and feel the babies.|`|Wnk7NLT0aa	Take her to the vet?|`|eNq3DOWmaa	it depends, did you use a condom or not?|`|mOayTJDmaa	Buy a preg test and let her pee on it.

Take them for a walk right before bedtime and tire them out, play fetch with them.  Just get the energy out and they will sleep more!<br>  <br>  Add:  What do you do when they get up?  Do you get up as well?  If so you may be adding to the problem by doing what they want.  Try ignoring them - once they realize you aren't going to give in maybe they will get in a routine of sleeping through the night.  Good luck, I can only imagine how frustrating that is!  I am lucky, my dog has always slept through the night.

All you would be doing is cutting it short & not really getting any thing out of the ear canal.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It would be much easier just to put some powder in the canal and pull. I doubt the average dog would accept you putting a mechanical devise in their ears. <br>  I have never even thought of it in the 25+ years of grooming|`|9DtJeAUKaa	I agree it would be cutting it short & not really getting it out. At least it would be a trim until you could do it properly.<br>  <br>  A groomer can do it (stay & watch them, I've groomed/assisted groomed & some of them are mean) or take your dog to a vet.<br>  <br>  Or do it yourself. Sprinkle a little ear powder in the ears, get a pair of hemostats scissors & grab the hair then twist as you would spaghetti around a fork while gently pulling. As you twist the hair around the hemoststats it will start coming out anyway. You can use your fingers too as seen in this video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mi3Aouu3e4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mi3Aouu3...</a><br>  I prefer hemostats, but do it how you feel comfortable.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	I just pluck ear fur with my fingers.
xGmbEzOZaa	Perhaps they did really think that your cow was dead.  Cows do tend to lay on their side when they are dying. However, they do sometimes sleep on their side. It's might just be a matter of preference. <br>  <br>  You may also want to check and see if she has any bloating near her stomach.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Too bad you were not totally awake.  You could have told them that is why some of the milk is labeled "pasturized">cause it is laying in the pasture.<br>    Obviously they do not know anything about how animals sleep.  But myself I would have thought it more normal that a cow would have its legs under it rather than laying on its side.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	How the heck are any of us suppose to know what their intentions were?  Perhaps they really did believe she was dead and felt it was urgent to inform you.  If they don't really know much about farm animals, they may have had no idea that cows do sometimes lay on their sides.  For future reference, just inform them that if they think one of your animals might be dead, they should go and check on it before coming to you.  Personally, I would be very grateful that they were worried about one of my animals and came to me first rather than being annoyed that they woke me up.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Cows like to sleep laying flat out too.  They don't always sleep setting up.  I would just check her good and make sure she doesn't look like she's running a fever.  If she is her nose will be all dry and peeling.  Also make sure she is breathing without any difficulty or is she raspy sounding when she breathes?

I've used them and don't see the point. And no martingale will be able to keep him from putting his head down to take the reins.<br>  <br>  Next time he does that it's a one rein stop. Take one rein and pull it back around to your hip. This will bend the horse's head and neck forcing him to turn, which forces him to slow down and stop. Make sure when she does this she is not holding her opposite rein tight because she can flip the horse over (watch a movie with horse's falling down and look at their reins). <br>  <br>  This horse should be working in a lot of circles right now to learn to supple and bend and work from behind. If he's off the track (even if he's not fresh off the track) straight lines are going to kick him into racing mode.<br>  <br>  Also tell your sister to close her fingers and sit on her seat bones. if she's leaning forward and has her fingers open the horse is going to be able to pull her right out of the tack. When he pulls she needs to sit BACK and circle immediately. He'll get the hint. Until she teaches him to stop doing what he's doing he'll continue because he can.|`|XgMK07rEaa	My old horse you to do it so we got him vet checked and he had mouth uclers making the bit painful in his mouth:(<br>  once sorted we eased him back in now his is fine <br>  hope this helps|`|qoL7LTIUaa	use bungees he pulls his head he will be pulling on himself|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	If your sister has a good seat have her sit deeper in the saddle as though she is doing dressage.  The horse should respond to her weight.<br>  Most Thoroughbreds were at on point at the track.  If this horse has then is was train to run against the bit so heavy contact won't help in stopping it will only make him go faster.  There is a chance that he wants a longer rein though you should ease him into contact.  Get him used to feeling the bit without rebelling against it.  If he goes to toss his head check him but you have to be able to perceive the toss beforehand so this may also be difficult if you are not sensitive to the vibrations in the reins. <br>  You should not jump this horse until you are sure this problem is taken care of.  If the horse gallops the jumps then it and the rider could get seriously injured.  You need to do flat work with this horse until you have no trouble with the head.  <br>  I find that Martingales are only temporary fixes.  I don't like them but that's just me.  <br>  You should also check the horses back, feet and mouth.  Sudden changes in behavior such as this are often brought on by a change in health.  There is a chance that there was something this particular horse was used to at the other barn that is not at yours.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|DLxh9CANaa	I think this is a pain response, Felicity. You need to have this horse thoroughly examined by the vet and by the equine dentist, and it wouldn't hurt to have a chiropractor look at him too. When horses throw their heads around like this one is doing, the number one cause of that is usually mouth pain of some sort. Has this horse ever been checked to see if he has wolf teeth buried in his gums, near the area where the bit goes? If per chance he has an impacted or buried tooth, every time your sister tugs or pulls on the reins, the bit HITS that tooth, causing him SEVERE PAIN, Felicity, and as a result, he throws his head up and is hard to stop. Impacted wolf teeth are rather common in show jumpers- I have know a few of them which had this problem, in fact. <br>  <br>  In addition to the possibility of mouth problems, another thing you need to look at is back pain, and pain caused by ill or improperly fitting tack and equipment. When was the last time you had your saddle looked at by a professional to see if it actually FITS this horse correctly? If this has never been done, I'd look into getting it done as soon as possible. Likewise, has this horse ever been looked at by a chiropractor see if he needs to have his spine adjusted? Back problems frequently manifest themselves as either lameness or by behavior issues, and avoiding contact because of pain is one of these. Simply putting a martingale on the horse won't solve a problem like this, if per chance he has an injury in his back. Could the horse have navicular disease? If so, every time he lands over a jump, it HURTS his feet, Felicity. That's yet another possible reason for his behavior- and a reason why he needs a medical exam. What about the possibility of his having Lyme disease- has he ever been in an area where there were ticks around, and could he ever have been bitten by one? Horses can get Lyme too, just as people can, and one of the major symptoms of the disease is unexplained lameness and behavior problems because of sore muscles and joints. I would have your vet pull some blood for a Lyme titer when he comes to do the medical exam. He can also check the horse's levels of hormones, such as thyroid, for example, and check for insulin resistance. Lyme disease is easily treated with antibiotics and rest. In short, I think you have some investigating to do where this horse is concerned, and you need to make sure that this is really JUST a behavior issue, and not related to pain, which I think is not the case.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I agree with Mulereiner!  Sounds like operator error.  Call the barn where she got the horse and ask if she can take some lessons with either the former owner or the standing trainer at the barn (If they were the folks who worked with the horse in the first place.).<br>  <br>  Also sounds like the standing martingale is NOT adjusted properly, because if it was, he wouldn't be able to pull the reins from your sister's hands.

Give her some time and let her come out and explore on her own time. If that doesn't work she is most likely too feral to be a pet, and you could consider adopting her out to someone as a barn cat. That way she is taken care of by someone, but she doesn't have to be uncomfortable and scared by constantly being around people. That is the premise of TNR(trap neuter release) programs. This helps to cut down on the litters the feral cats have and still allows them to live out thier lives.|`|QRBi7feQaa	let her take a little while to adjust if that don't work ask a local shelter how u can go about having her fostered and socialized if u r unable to do it yourself

Sd1m5j1Waa	It takes a while, maybe 2 weeks.  You should at least take it out for 15 minutes a day to sit on your  finger in front of your face while you talk to it.   Gradually get it used to your hand by feeding it millet while it sits on your finger.  If you can, let it sit next to you on the couch, on your shoulder for as long as you are able, daily.  When you go in the kitchen, take it and say let's go in the kitchen, etc.  Say do you want a cracker, or whatever you want every time you give it a treat.  You will be rewarded!  Touch it more everyday and don't be afraid of it biting you.  If it does, say be nice, because that is what you want.  Don't yell at it, or say no, as that is what he might pick up to say.  Best of luck, Cockatiels are wonderful birds!  The bird will let you take it out as you should wheni t's your choice to.

HgMFrllLaa	Spay your dog asap. THIS will surely increase her chances of longer life span.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Maybe you should look into all the factors of breeding first. There are more dangers than that. You need to know what to inspect on a dog before doing it. The costs if she has problems giving birth and the money you will need to spend for 8 weeks after the puppies are born. I happen to know someone that breeds champion line English Pointers. On one occasion the mother couldn't get the puppies out and had to go for emergency C-section in the middle of the night. It cost my friend a lot of money. He still breeds but tells me it is a lot of work. This is something you really need to research and prepare for. You can't just let your dog get pregnant and expect it to do everything itself. I once thought of breeding my Shih-Tzu, but there are too many dangers. Now that she has had her first heat I am going to get her spayed. I dont even want an accident to happen.|`|ORe8qdtTaa	Obviously it could - you could lose her during the birth if you get the breeding even slightly wrong!  Do you want to do it right or just chuck 2 dogs together with no thought to the health of your dog or the pups they will produce?  <br>  <br>  Read this and see if you are prepared to do it right.<br>  <br>  Should I breed from my pet *****?<br>  <br>  The decision to breed a litter should not be undertaken lightly & needs careful thought about all the responsibilities involved. The would-be breeder needs to ask themselves the following questions:<br>  <br>  Can I afford the costs involved & do I have the time to rear a litter successfully? Breeding a litter & caring for Mum & her puppies is expensive and very time consuming. You have to have the funds available for the stud fee, eye testing fee, vet fees (these can be costly particularly if a caesarean section is needed), quality food for Mum & pups once weaned, set up equipment (eg whelping box, bedding, heating, puppy pen), Kennel Club registration fees etc. Bear in mind, if you have a small litter or incur high veterinary expenses, you may make a loss on your litter - breeding puppies is not an easy way to make money unless you cut corners or mass produce pups on a commercial scale as puppy farmers do. Sometimes, it may be necessary to keep puppies for longer than 8 weeks if the right homes are not forthcoming, so you need to be prepared for this & for the extra costs involved in feeding & vaccinating older pups.<br>  <br>  If you can bear the financial costs, do you have the time available? Looking after a Mum with a newborn litter requires round the clock attention initially - it is not something you can do if you work long hours. Once puppies are weaned, the hard work really begins: It is very rewarding raising a litter properly, but it takes countless hours in feeding, cleaning up followed by more feeding & more cleaning up! The breeder must also make the effort to socialise puppies by introducing them to common household noises & letting them meet all different kinds of people, including children, all under careful supervision of course. Time also needs to be spent on vetting potential owners, making sure that your precious puppies only go the most suitable homes - this can be one of the most difficult aspects of breeding a litter as enquirers are not always what they seem when they first make contact with a breeder. Sadly not all enquirers can offer a good home environment for a puppy. <br>  <br>  Could I cope if things go wrong?  there are also occasions when things do go disastrously wrong. Sometimes caesarean section surgery is required to deliver puppies safely & rarely, a breeder can lose both the ***** & all her puppies. Other problems that could arise include a failure of the ***** to produce milk, meaning her puppies have to be hand-reared (requiring bottle feeding every 2 hours round the clock). <br>  <br>  Can I provide after sales help & advice to any puppy owners who might need it? A responsible breeder will always be happy to answer questions & provide advice to new puppy owners should they need it. This means having good knowledge on subjects like puppy training & common health issues. A responsible breeder also has a lifetime responsibility to the puppies they produce. This means being prepared to take back one of their puppies (however old he/she might be) for rehoming should the need arise (unfortunately people's circumstances do change), even if the timing is not convenient for the breeder. Responsible breeders do not "pass the buck" to  Rescue or to general Rescue Societies. A breeder must also bear the moral responsibility if any of their puppies develops a hereditary defect. It needs to be noted that sometimes the courts will make breeders legally responsible for such defects - buyers are now much more aware of their consumer rights & puppies are treated like any other "goods" under current consumer legislation.<br>  <br>  If after considering the above, you decide that you are ready for the responsibility of breeding a litter, then you should consult your *****'s breeder for advice as to suitable stud dogs, assuming he/she is reputable and experienced. The best stud dog for your ***** does not necessarily live just down the road from you so you must be prepared to travel if necessary. You must also be prepared to have your ***** screened for known hereditary problems where testing schemes are available, including eye-testing by a specialist opthalmologist and hip scoring. More information on health issues in your breed can be obtained from your breed clubs. <br>  <br>  You will also need to read as much as possible about breeding, with your first essential purchase being "The Book Of The *****" by Evans & White (available from most good book shops or from internet book suppliers such as Amazon.co.uk). This book is regarded by many as "The Breeders Bible" & covers every aspect of breeding & rearing a litter you are likely to need.

I'm tempted to say yes it will shorten her life, because frankly you don't sound as if you are seriously going to get into breeding - for the right reasons.  It's a complete myth that bitches need to have one litter (before spaying).  It is true that the fewer seasons she has, the less the likelihood that she could develop mammary cancer or uterine cancer later on however.  And spaying will mean she absolutely cannot pick up an infection like pyometra which can kill her.<br>  <br>  Don't do it - it's a lot of work for one thing and the world does not need more puppies, unless as I say, you are seriously going to start a bloodline to contribute to the well-being of your breed.<br>  <br>  And every time you put a ****** in whelp, you are risking their life because it could all go so badly wrong (particularly if you are a novice).|`|p7swtBYzaa	It sure will if she has complications and dies trying to give birth.

If you know other people with colts that need gelding you can all get together and the vet will often give you a deal.  It will also cost a bit less if you have other things for the vet to do or if the vet is already out in your area for another reason.  A friend of mine and I used to always have the vet out on the same day and since we were out in the same area he'd divide the farm visit fee between us.<br>  The vet I prefer to use charges around $250 for an uncomplicated gelding.

97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	The perfect headset in an Arabian English horse comes not from gimmicks nor tie-downs nor martingales.  It comes from proper collection and impulsion and the confirmation for an upright carriage.  <br>  <br>  Even in top barns and shows across the country, I see people riding behind the bit or incorrectly using a double bridle and hitting the horses mouth constantly.  <br>  <br>  Are you looking for a hunter set or an english/saddleseat set? <br>  <br>  A good rider with excellent hands should be able to feel when the horse is balanced and collected - and then raise or lower the neck according to the gait desired [lower for western & hunt, higher for english].<br>  <br>  Snaffle work on a hunt horse lets you keep light contact with a lower headset.  Moving in to the double bridle gives greater ability to raise the head and inceased contact on the bits.  In a double bridle, the snaffle is for constant contact, the curb should be kept light except to remind the horse to collect when he starts relaxing or extending when you don't want him to.|`|1XngLDxyaa	Well I would only hope at 17 he was still full of himself, as most arabs keep going for many many years. I knew one who showed till he was 30.<br>  <br>  As for the Arab headset it is different, alot of flexing and "dressage work" is usually not the way to go for a proper arab headset. Usually when working an arabian you use a martingale or drawreins (if experienced)...but only as an aide. Not to force collection, as most arabs are pretty good at collecting naturally. But the way and type of martingale makes a huge difference. go to www.sstack.com and look at their arabian training equipment. It will show you the type of martingale you should use. Also make sure the bit you are using is right for him. Most arabians in English (which is huntseat pleasure) use kimberwicks either jointed or ported. And at his age a kimberwick is most appropriate.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you are not trying to get him to hold his neck at almost a flat parallel to the ground (aka quarter horse like), as that is completely improper for an arabian. They should have a nice flex and arch with the nose slightly behind the vertical.<br>  <br>  Make sure your saddle fits properly, this is a big thing with arabians. Ill fitting saddle, dont expect a head set at all. Arabs move in a very "rounded" fashion, which is why headsets are a bit more natural for them. And a bad saddle prevents that rounding.<br>  <br>  I highly advise finding and talking with an Arabian trainer/breeder near you.|`|3pGKx9gEaa	Ditto everything everyone else said...YOU NEED DRESSAGE LESSONS.  You need leg yields, to learn to move the bit in the horse's mouth, learn about impulsion and collection.  You need to do hill work to strengthen the hind quarters, etc.  ***Dressage lessons***  All the advice on this page that is correct came from dressage.<br>  <br>  Also, a martingale only keeps a horse from throwing it's head way up.   Only draw reins would actually bring the horses head down.  However, you should not use them.  Youcannot force a horse into a correct "frame" by just moving its head.  Everything else must be in place as well!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3a3ab74b739b895ace57c79579161275aa	Do you have a trainer? Have you ever taken dressage lessons? I would recommend that you take some so you can understand how to collect a horse. <br>  <br>  A perfect headset is not just about his head and neck. It involves his whole body. You want your horse to be using his behind and pushing from the back. <br>  <br>  This is hard to explain through words and maybe someone else will have a better answer. But I would still highly recommend dressage lessons, no matter what discipline you are.|`|3VaF9gH0aa	If you mean in a contact, on the bit, in fram etc. then this is how I do it:<br>  <br>  Flex your horses neck to the outside, put your outside leg on and inside leg back to make them over bend to the outside, then switch and do it to the inside, but maintain contact on the outside rein. Half-halt down the inside rein and your horse should offer to lower its head and go into a contact, and if not it helps with bend. Keep doing it until they do lower their head and give with your hands as soon as they do as a reward so they know thats what you want. You can start in halt then when you get it, do it in walk then trot etc. <br>  <br>  Basic things like circles can help with bend a lot as long as you ride them correctly. Really think about everything. Push them out with your inside leg and stop them falling out with the ouside rein. Don't use your weight too much to turn. Don't drop your inside shoulder, and look around the circle, don't drag your horse round with the inside rein, use you legs. Keep using your reins less and less and this will help the horse with its balance and straightness.<br>  <br>  To help with a contact on the circle you could make your circles very small and then leg yield out, (push them out with the inside leg) but maintain the bend, don't pull the out with the outside rein because this will give them outside bend.<br>  <br>  All these exercises help with bend and straightness and this will help with getting your horse in a contact. Sitting trot will help with collecting because you can absorb the horses rhythm and slow it down with your seat, but like I said I would extent before you collect. When you get good at these bending exercises, half-halt down one rein and keep the contact on the other. Half-halt on the rein that your horse is least bent towards. This is how you ask your horse to go into a contact (frame etc). Again when your horse lowers its head, give with your hands to reward and use your voice too.<br>  <br>  Sometimes sitting trot will help getting your horse in a contact because you sit straighter when you sit rather than rise, but if your horse is working correctly from its back end, then it will be very hard to sit to because it will be bouncy, (thats how I know I'm doing it right)<br>  <br>  It takes a long time but eventually your horse should offer it all the time. Good luck.
JiCKFTuIaa	Just once, and we got what we KNEW we would get.<br>  Out of that litter of four, one little guy was strictly pet quality, two finished their championship but proved to be only phenotype. The forth (the only girl) finished her championship and was genotype.<br>  What we were after was consistency of type, and we got it. Right down to the silly white spot on their butts.<br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/Picture015.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a><br>  She is a great granddaughter of that breeding, and finished from the puppy classes.<br>  That line has now produced 13 litters over the last 16 years, all with at least one champion. A couple with every pup in the litter finishing.<br>  Important note:<br>  If you haven't done the research don't do the breeding DOES NOT only apply to close breedings.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Did you know that the Llewellin Setter as a breed owes it's existance to the breeding of two littermates.<br>  That breeding took place in England BTW.<br>  <br>  "Stories were told about Rev. Harrison's dogs uncanny pointing ability. At this time THE English people bred more for show than hunting ability. Most of Rev. Harrison's dogs were "Marble Blue". On this trip to Carlisle, Mr. Laverack bought OLD MOLL, a Sliver Gray Belton. Mr. Laverack wrote in his book THE SETTER, "The MOST PERFECT specimen of Setter I have ever seen (was) the Rev. A. Harrison's Blue Belton "Old Moll" (she was particularly strong, powerful, and compacted in build."  He liked her so well that when she came in season, he took here back to be breed to her full brother, PONTO a Black Gray Belton, even knowing there was great many other dogs in this area supposedly just as good. As it turned out he was glad he made this choice. The pups turned out to be such superb dogs that he returned to Rev. Harrison and purchased PONTO from him. <br>          Mr. Laverack's purchase of Ponto and Old Moll are the foundation for what we know today as a LLEWELLIN SETTER."<br>  <a href="http://www.llewellin.com/Studdogs/irishkingbondhuashly.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.llewellin.com/Studdogs/irishk...</a>|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	No breeder that I know will breed that close. Many breeders will line breed with careful research and have great results but it is not usually a good idea to inbreed that close and I wouldn't trust a breeder that would do it. I feel there are just too many variables to consider and it would make me uncomfortable. <br>  If breeders do it responsibly and can get good results, no problem.....I just don't personally condone it.|`|AA10029366	Personally, no. And I don't think I ever would.<br>  <br>  My first Siberian husky was the result of a father/daughter accidental breeding from racing lines. She was a sweetheart, but a genetic nightmare and not the sharpest knife in the Siberian drawer. She had severe pannus, and allergies that eventually rendered her deaf.<br>  <br>  I now recognize that her bloodlines were notoriously untested for genetic health. But I would have to have a spotlessly clean pedigree -- and an EXTREMELY compelling reason -- to do a breeding like that intentionally.|`|dBdQB4KHaa	I have done mother Son breeding with hamsters and gurney pigs.<br>  They were healthy and happy.<br>  You can do mother sun Father daughter But you can not to brother sister. They have the DNA and that is why the have health problems. Many times it makes their immensities attack their good blood sells instead of infection.<br>  If you have Brother/ Sister A1  breading with mother/Father B1<br>  this is ok But you can not have Brother/Sister A2  With  Mother/Father  B1 or B2 . This has a raceo of  1/6th new DNA and is not enough to keep them healthy.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|9kTejB0uaa	No.  But I have done aunt/nephew and uncle/niece.  The former only produced one puppy, a lovely ******.  Mated to a complete outcross for her first litter, the dam only produced 2 puppies, neither of which was especially spectacular, so this girl wasn't destined to be the prolific brood I'd hoped !  However, although I kept the singleton ******, she started having seasons every 5 months, so in the end, I spayed her without taking a litter from her!  She lived to be 13 (normal for my line) and her vet visits were, apart from the spaying, minimal.  The uncle to niece mating produced 4, all males.  They all went to pet homes as I could only keep a couple of males at a time.  Nice puppies, although two were lost early (at 4/5), to cancer.<br>  <br>  Yes these matings mentioned in your question are indeed inbreeding, but I'd not condemn any responsible and experienced breeder for doing this.  If they know their bloodlines this can, and does produce some excellent results.  The secret is to go out immediately, for the next generation.   And the significant word is IF........ this is where the art of breeding, good stockmanship comes into a breeding programme.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately today, too many inexperienced, novices even, have got into breeding, for all the wrong reasons.  And the majority are wrecking it for the few who are left who do know what they are doing.<br>  <br>  Rant over.<br>  <br>  ps  I should just say that even with the most experienced breeder, recessive genes can, and do, come out of the woodwork to upset the best laid plans.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	No, the closest I have done was uncle/neice.<br>  <br>  I had a litter of 7 healthy pups.  I kept 3 of them myself, a friend of mine has another, another friend has a fifth.  Two of the pups were shown and became champions, one of those was a National Specialty winner.  Two of the pups were coated, a disqualifying fault, one of the pups developed a crooked leg, but I blame that on the diet they were feeding her while she was growing (Eukanuba puppy, which I specifically recommend against for this breed, plus all sorts of junk "people" food).  They are 10 1/2 years old now and quite healthy.<br>  <br>  I don't have a problem with f/d or m/s breedings, provided the breeder knows what they are doing.<br>  <br>  EDIT: EssJay, I am absolutely appalled at that.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Many years ago, we were involved in showing and breeding dogs. We only did this with the supervision of a seasoned breeder. She had a long line of Champion bloodlines in her dogs. On rare occasion, she would use a grandfather in the mix with her female. Most times, though, she would use an unrelated stud and give the pick of the litter. She was very educated in the bettering the breed standard. She never used that close of a relation to breed. There can be underlying characteristics you may not want to bring out in a breed that way!|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	I've done a g-father/g.daughter breeding-I got pups....nothing spectacular & nothing wrong.<br>  <br>  There's nothing inherently wrong w/in-breeding or line-breeding.

499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Do an internet search on how to cycle an aquarium. This will explain the process to you. There is just way too much to go into here. <br>  <br>  Basicly, so far, it sounds like everything is normal. You will find that by doing some partial water changes with a gravel vac the water will eventually clear.<br>  <br>  You should never use soap to clean anything in an aquarium. Any trace is toxic to your fish, so never use soap again.<br>  <br>  Do this research today so that you can get started. Please do not delay.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	You go to your local Walmart and get some clear water drops. Put the amount that it says to and if it doesn't clear in 48 hours then you can treat again. I use this product and it works great and you can add the drops while the fish are in the tank and it won't hurt them.|`|kQDWVRvzaa	Most likely the problem is that you didnt wash the gravel first. This will cloud the water. Could be you are over feeding. Best thing to do since it is only a ten gallon is to start over and clean everything again.

px27V5N9aa	1.  survey the area for the dark spots that are a give away for urine.<br>  Geldings normally pee closer to the center.  Mares to the sides.<br>  2.  Lumpy areas are normally a dead give away for a manure pile.<br>  3.  Make a bank along the side of the wall of manure free shavings<br>  4.  Toss a rakefull onto the wall above the embankment.  The manure will roll down away from the 'hill' so you can scoop them up.<br>  5.  There are different ways of dispersing the shavings. <br>       a.  Evenly spread wall to wall<br>       b.  pile up in the center of the stall<br>       c.  Spread out shavings but leave a nice bank along the wall to help keep horse from casting<br>       d.  Spread at the back of the stall and keep away from the grain/water/hay area<br>  6.  Clean water bucket if needed with brush, refill<br>  7.  Restock hay<br>  <br>  Lime is used when you remove alot of shavings and the stall is 'wet' or smells of ammonia.  It doesn't 'burn'  but will cause skin irritation if they lay on it for long periods or stand on it bare.  Just make sure you have adequate bedding to cover it.  <br>  When I clean a stall and the horse is going to be out of it all day, I pull the shavings away from the wet areas so it can dry and air out.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	Remember to take your pitch fork and brush over the shavings or whatever you or she uses to find poop that's hidden!|`|adb009bb7026fa990c0936cae97cb432aa	Be thorough.  Assuming they are using wood chips:  Make sure you get every area where there is urine and paddies.  Where there is urine remove the bedding to the base and put down some lime if there is a wet spot.  Also ask the owner how often she removes all bedding and replaces it with fresh.  Also ask how often they put lime in the stalls.|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	To get a really nice clean bed, straw or shavings, remove water tub,  go over and pick out all the poo and wet bits you can see first. Pull down the banks. Throw everything against the walls and then remove all the poo and wet bits again. Re-make the banks, top up with more bedding if needs be, smooth over the rest and ensure it is deep enough. Replace water. Happy mucking out!!!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Pick out the wet stuff. Pick out the poop you can see. Go through the rest of the shavings and flip it over. As you flip it over the poop that's buried will come out and you pick that and sift it.<br>  <br>  Waste as little shavings as possible while still cleaning the stalls. Shavings are expensive!|`|86907ad9cce026f929aa1445843edac4aa	dont cover the real owner in horse sh*t|`|UZBl63blaa	is the horse on deep litter semi deep litter or? test you on mucking out? as long as your not wasting money throwing clean bedding on barrow and your horse isnt standing in muck and wet, then dont worry. ask her to show you how she mucks her horse out first, because nomatter what anybody says, no body is better at mucking out your own horse than you. (owner) if its a full muck out with banks, tell her you remove under one bank a week, and muck out in morning, skip out at evening. if its on shaving ask the reason for this? is it due to respatory reasons, or greedy horse eating straw? its good that your asking the reasons for the bedding rather than your technique. if its a straw bed ask wht type of straw as greedy horses are likely to eat barley straw, thats bound to impress. wheat straw is beast for gready straw eaters as they tend not to eat it.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Everyone has a different way to do this.  We bank extra bedding to the side and back of the stall so I would hate for anyone to just spread that on me.<br>  Ask first if you see banked shavings if that's extra or just pushed there by the animal.  Some do that.<br>  Flipping the shavings is always best as your final run through after you dug out the urine and sifted through the shaving.  Sometimes you can feel a piece of manure you missed under your shoe, so walk around the stall.<br>  I would ask about Lime before you ever put it down.  Lime can burn the frogs and skin of a horse and sometimes is not used if the horse is going to be placed in that stall soon.  If a mat is down I do not see the need for lime since you got the urine up but again everyone does it different.<br>  If you see Lime ask her about it and if you don't still ask since that will make you look like you know something. <br>  After we dig out the urine I just refill the spot with shavings that are in the stall.  I do not get new since it's just going to be peed on again.<br>  Remove all buckets before you start. You will look great doing this.  Ask where the water bucket brush and bleach is kept so she knows your willing to scrub a bucket.<br>  Be honest from the start and say that since you know she's watching you might be nervous.  People might not realize this until you mention it but once you do they get it.  She might want to leave you alone for 10 minutes and return to see how the job was done or coming along.<br>  I can do 4 stalls in 20-25 but I do not brush my water buckets down each time.<br>  Good luck and enjoy that horse.  You'll do fine!!!!!<br>  Kath|`|AA12212950	To be honest I would just ask how she likes it done. Does she deep litter or is it fully mucked out every night? Does she leave the bankings or pull them down etc? How deep does she generally keep the bed?<br>  <br>  Personally my horse needs a deep bed as he kicks it about a lot. I generally stash clean shavings in the bankings and only pull them in to the bed when I need them rather than mixing them through but will depend on horse and owner.<br>  <br>  There's not much point in guessing and I personally would be more impressed with someone asking me how I would want it done rather than just doing it their own way|`|JltE5LIHaa	Tie the horse up out of the stable with a small hay net to keep it occupied. Remove the water bucket (if there is one) and the feed bucket (same) and the hay net (ditto). Try to keep as much of the good straw as you can, pile it up at the sides. Remove as much loose poo as poss by working the fork under it and giving it a little wiggle. Take out the wet the brush the hay to the sides. Sweep the cleared stable floor. During the day this can be left to dry out, (just a tip) but if it is evening you can then pull down the bed and top up with new straw if required. Clean out the water bucket and refill with clean water and put back in the stable asking for help lifting it if it is too heavy. If there is no one around fill the bucket to the point where you can carry it alone then use a 2nd bucket to top it up. Refill the hay net and feed bucket if required and put back in the stable. Finally check the horses hooves and pick them out. Put horsey back in stable all warm and snugly. This takes me about 20 - 30 mins to do but I have been doing it for several years. Good luck and enjoy!|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	straw or shavings, just be sure to get down to the floor and be sure to remove all the wet stuff.

Ps7zn6fXaa	Hi, I am also 13 years old,<br>  <br>  Give him food 2 a day he might not like it at first but he will get yous to it.<br>  take him on walks wen ppl are at work then the other dogs can't storm out of there yards wen the ppl get home.|`|cO5m6Eqnaa	Adult dog, so normally feed twice a day, morning and early evening. You need to train him as has been suggested and he'll get into a rhythm and let you know when he needs to be going out usually. My habit is to leave the door onto the yard open as much as possible. In terms of actully walking, once a day is usually fine, and not too far, but the more he can handle at a relatively young adult age the better.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I would set out food for him every morning and evening (check your bag of kibble for amount.) If he seems hungry you can give a little serving around lunch time if you're home. Leave water available when you are around, but pick it up when you go out (otherwise he may drink it all and have to pee while you are gone.)<br>  <br>  I would take him outside to potty first thing in the morning, after eating or drinking (it's different for every dog but they usually have to go within 30 minutes), after playing, after naps, and right before bed. If he's still having accidents in between these times, then bring him out every half hour to pee.<br>  <br>  WALK-walks (as in trips around the block) don't have to be that frequent if he seems calm enough indoors - i would say one twenty minute walk a day would be fine. Increase it if he seems hyper or decrease it (every other day) if he doesn't care one way or the other.<br>  <br>  I would look into getting a crate - maybe check the paper to see if there are any for sale, check local pet stores. It shouldn't be too pricey because it won't be huge - it should only be big enough to sit, stand, turn around, and sleep. Crates act like dens, and dogs don't like to mess in their dens - so in theory (if you don't leave the dog in too long) they will help a dog learn to "hold it" while you are gone.<br>  <br>  Pick up the pee pads. Clean ALL carpets thoroughly with the proper cleaner - i can almost BET the pee smell soaked through some of those pads. Block of his access to other rooms if possible - that will make it easier for YOU to watch him.<br>  <br>  Potty signs: sniffing, circling, sudden stop in activity/play.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Mibby, this is a 3 year old dog, not a puppy.<br>  <br>  An adult does not need 3 meals a day and as it is an adult with ingrained bad habits it will be harder to break them.  But yet, take the dog outside often and praise when he does it in the right place. You will have to be very consistent and patient.|`|b75bba675dda73187aeb83430b085b44aa	Feed him three times a day.  Water him all day, except 2 hours before you go to bed.  A puppy can go potty every 45 minutes because they are so small.  Take him out first thing in the morning, and about every hour after that.  He may not go potty everytime, sometimes he may need to be out for 15 minutes to go potty.  As soon as he has went potty outside praise him, use the word potty, and bring him right inside so he knows potty time is potty time.  He will most likely respond to treats to relize he has done a good thing.  Good luck!|`|84558de0349fa374ed3605ac33e8e36daa	Kristin is right, you should get a crate. It is always recommended to crate train a dog. It will be his safe spot. He'll sleep in it and spend time in it when you're gone and like Kristin said, he won't mess in it because dogs don't go to the bathroom where they sleep. <br>  I've adpoted a second puppy about 2 weeks ago and the first day I left him in the kitchen (with a puppy gate in the doorway) for a couple of hours while I was gone and he peed and pooped all over the kitchen. Now he stays in his crate over night and when nobody is home and he won't pee or poop at all! We take him out right before we leave and right after we get home and about every other hour while we're home with him. And usually about 10-15 minutes after he ate. We feed our older dog twice a day, mornings and evenings and the puppy gets fed three times a day. <br>  Try the crate thing, it will work! :o)<br>  Good luck!|`|wEZr5JbYaa	Go and buy a create and put the puppy in the create every time you leave or when it is time to go to bed.  If you put his bed in there he will know that it is "His House".  If you leave him in the create when you leave the house he knows not to go to the bathroom in "his house".  They don't like being near the mess any more than we do.  When you get home walk him and walk him before to leave as well.<br>  Feed him once in the morning and once in the evening about a 1/4 cup of food each time.  Walk him about five minutes after he eats.  Once you start to make this a routine he will adapt to it and start to follow schedule.  <br>  You should walk him to "go potty" around 5 to 10 times a day.  At least one of those walks should be longer than the rest that way he gets exercise and you do as well.   <br>  Have fun and good luck. :)|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	It usually best to split up how much food the bag says to give him based on his weight into two meals. <br>  <br>  As for walking. He needs one 20-30min walk a day and to be taken out to relieve himself another 3-4 times. Small breed dogs need to be taken out more often then large breed dogs. This is b/c they have small bladders making it harder from them to hold their urine. <br>  <br>  For the pee pads...if he is going both on them and on the floor, how often are you changing the pads? They should be changed every other time he goes on them..or even every time.
jM7CyxQzaa	As an ex racer the chances are she simply doesn't equate your home as somewhere she has to keep clean. Most dogs in kennels pee in the kennel, and since racing greyhounds are kennelled they aren't always clean in a house environment. Also I know a lot of greyhound girls pee the bed, normally it's the more shy ones that do it.<br>  <br>  There are two things to do here, first is to increase the amount of time she spends in the garden as an opportunity to pee. The reason here is twofold, firstly the more out time she has the less likely she'll need to pee indoors, the second is that the more you take her out and make it obvious you expect her to pee the more she'll realise peeing indoors is a big no no.<br>  <br>  She may be marking her new territory, which is a more difficult problem to deal with. at this stage it will take patience and time to cure the problem if this is the reason she's peeing, Once she's totally settled in (six months or so) she may decide she's safe and then just stop peeing. If not you have a bit more work to do.<br>  <br>  Try to find out if she peed in the bed of the kennel where she was before she came to you, and if the answer is no then consider changing over her bedding to whatever they use - I know this is likely to be impractical but it may not be for a long while. If that works gradually reintroduce your current bedding system along side the her kennel one, and if that works gradually take out the kennel style bedding. The reason for this is she may not realise that that is her new style bedding,she's thinks she's just using this till  her 'proper' one arrives :)<br>  <br>  For the most part tho I'd increase her time outdoors, take her for a walk last thing at night rather than just putting her in the garden. When she pees outside at ANY time give her loads of praise for it,  try to get her peeing on command (which you do by saying 'be quick' or whatever when she is naturally going to go, and then praising her when she's been, pretty soon once you say 'be quick' she'll know what you mean. If you can then catch her starting to pee then you can get a 'NO!' in and immediately remove her to the garden (not forgetting to praise once she's peed out there)<br>  <br>  Two months is not really that long, I'd give her more time and then if the problem is not sorted after say six to nine months then go to a behaviourist in your area as there may be some other underlying problem you are not aware of (hence my comment about it being the more shy greyhound girls who pee in kennels) - this of course once a vet has given her a clean bill of health.<br>  <br>  The above advice about removing the bed could work too. Give both a try and see if anything works.|`|AFrIkjoqaa	One thing you can try is to remove the bed and buy some cheap vinyl flannel backed tablecloths and cut to size and fit them in the bed so if she does wet it won't be on material and won't leave that dreaded smell they like so much. My dog now sleeps on the floor on a dog blanket and he has not peed yet. I got rid of the bed because I couldn't get that nasty smell out it's called marking their territory Change the Territory she'll get used to it.|`|nXxdvgwLaa	It's not normal for dogs to continuously pee where they sleep. I would definitely check with the vet.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Why not see your vet?  Perhaps she has some medical problems.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Check with your vet to see if there's a medical reason|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Have her checked for some medical problem, a urinary tract infection.

You can name him after a person or place in a book, after the team or player. My Dad had a dog named Brutus because he liked Julius Cesar & the Roman Empire.  When I was very young we had a dog named Coco, she was all white, but had brown ears.  Currently I have a beagle named Buddy Lee after the little guy of the Levi commercials.  Mostly I call him Buttonhead or Goofball because he makes me laugh.  Have fun naming your new puppy. I wish you both lots of love.|`|4QizPDQNaa	1.Percival or Parzival are variations of the name of a brave knight during the days of King Arthur (I like Parzival better).<br>  2.Charlie is not very unique but it is cute.<br>  3.Shia--as in Shia LeBeouf. I think he's adorable:)<br>  4.Shasta is an interesting name that I saw in a book<br>  5.

Xyj4nmFnaa	yes this is true their smelliest gland is in their testicles which secretes though their penis when they wee so with the testees removed it does reduce the smell although they do have glands under their chins as well so the smell does not go completely but you can buy some brill ferret shampoos which are great for reducing the rest.|`|C75EsUXRaa	Yes it is very true, it reduces the hormonal oils secreted by the skin, and thus lessens the smell by the way someone up there mentions the smell comes through the penis, its rubbish its their fur that carries the smell,|`|3dT7f39maa	I have six ferrets and yes thats 100% true.|`|FoeyqAZqaa	It does reduce the smell.

Just as long as it isn;t too crowded for them.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	There is no way I would leave my dogs behind.  If your mom and brother want a dog, they can get one themselves and train it and pay for its bills, there is nothing from stopping them from getting their own dog.  I think it is selfish of them to want you to leave your dogs behind after you did all the hard work in training them, and after you spent your money on the vet bills.  No, it is not selfish of you to take your dogs with you, it is your responsibility.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Your brother has no say in the matter. He's underage and doesn't live with you or your mother.<br>  <br>  Your mother (if you are under 18) can make you leave the dogs.  If you are an "adult" then you should tell her everything you just told us. You have cared for them, paid for them, walked them, etc and you should be allowed to keep them.

It's about what is best for the dogs, in my opinion.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i would take them. it sounds like you are a responsible dog owner, and if you are the one responsible for their care now, you have every right to take them when you go. let your family know that you have no problem with the dogs coming to visit them, but that you are going to keep them with you when you move.|`|JNAyyZRMaa	It is all up to you. If you truly love the dogs and believe that you have a steady job with a reasonable amount of income, a pretty big apartment space, and the dogs seem to like being with you, then you should definetly take them. This is not about you or your mother, it is about how well the dogs are and their happiness. If you are taking them with you, have a backup plan incase you don't have enough money to take care of them, and make sure that you have a vet nearby. To make your mother happy, visit her with the dogs in your free time. Just make sure that the dogs are happy too.|`|LSz1IT6Eaa	If you were the only one taking care of the dogs, then you should take them with you, as long as you can provide the type of care they have had in the past. Will they be left alone for longer periods of time if they move with you?  My son moved out and left his golden with us.  At this point I wouldn't want him to take the dog because he is always working, and I am home all day.  If he were able to spend more time with him, I would have no problem letting him take the dog.  I just don't think it is fair to any animal to have to be left alone for 10 hours a day if there are other options available.  Fortunately, my son agrees.  Just do what will be best for your dogs.
w9aR8ymGaa	there are a lot of them listed in rescues... <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.cgi?tmpl=1&exact=1&breed=Dachshund&animal=Dog" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.c...</a>  Maybe you can take some time to look through for the colors you are seeking?

WA9Y8QAEaa	Well maybe wait a while then since the cats are so fragile and everything. Or, you could get a dog that's older and not as playful, so you wouldn't have to worry about the cats. <br>  Good luck :)|`|NJfpY7nIaa	If you do decide to get one, adopt from a shelter. The people whom work there will tell you which are laid back and get along with cats.<br>  <br>  However, having animals in your life is expensive. You aren't paying for the bowls, leashes, food, vet care, ect...your parents might not want the financial responsibility of another animal. Times are hard right now.<br>  If your parents say no...it's no.|`|JPa0GzDjaa	Personally, I don't think you should get a dog yet. For one, it will upset your parents if you keep asking about it.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if the cats do have problems like you mentioned, it could get more uncomfortable for them. Especially if you get a puppy. I've just gotten myself a springer spaniel and she never leaves my cat alone. He's about five so, he's not worried about the puppy especially because he fights back but if he was elderly and suffered with leg problems or any other problem I would of gone against getting my springer.<br>  <br>  Third reason, dogs are expensive. I know that might not necessarily mean anything if you have the money for it, but you need to consider jabs, food, flea and tick treatment especially because cat flea's can live on dogs as well.<br>  <br>  If you're thinking about getting an older dog, the price factor will still be an issue. <br>  <br>  Also if you're thinking of getting an older dog, say from a rescue centre they might not be less considerate to cats dispite what previous owners or the rescue centre people may say.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!
zpwJR60baa	HI, I agree from Ocimom, but adding a little bit more.. <br>  <br>  When a cat got scared, they will be sensitive for a while.. leave it alone. <br>  Once it is healed she would come back to normal...|`|hvrw02Egaa	The scar is probably still a little sore.

Just pet her on her head or neck and don't bother her tummy till its healed completely and the fur is growing back.
w9aR8ymGaa	call your local SPCA or other shelter/rescue.  They often will neuter for a discount or even free.|`|6xphiZLSaa	Like the girl said before you can call the SPCA or local shelters. How old if your dog is it still under 5 months? I take my dog to Banfield inside of Petsmart. They have a program where you pay a fee of 125 and then 25 a month but that includes free neuter and free vaccinations along with office visits. The only thing you have to pay for is medication or like heartworm and flea and tick stuff. Its way cheaper then most vets and the staff is amazing at the store I go too. I actually lied about my dogs age to get him in there hes a 9 pound shipoo he was really 7 months when I went but they couldnt tell I just said he was under 6 months so I could get the free neuter. So if you dog is still young try it. Its really a great investment. Otherwise google it.

np6W9hnsaa	I would suggest giving him another command that is going to be way better then food. We have taught my dog the really reliable recall which is different from your regular recall because your practice 2-3 times a day and praise and treat for 1-2 minutes. You stand there slowly giving your dog treats in a happy voice for a good minute or two. No matter what she's doing she snaps around and darts over. <br>  I would use high value treats like warmed up hot dog. She only get warmed up hot dog when practicing your really reliable recall. And you don't shout, but you'd say it loud and firmly. You have someone holding your dog a distance away and you do a different recall word. Like our word is now, and you say with their name. "Shayna Now!!!" or you can do quick or come now or hondale, whatever you want. The first time the person holding your dog should run with him sso he goes to you and you can be like good, good as he's coming towards you. You want to make sure every time you practice this command it is done right. <br>  <br>  Another thought would be a variation of this, but the leave it command. You could say no eat or no touch and when you say it loud and firmly you take your high value treats and keep walking with the lead with a happy voice treating for a minute or two. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and feel free to e-mail.|`|91F2X74Raa	try to pull hes leash and mabye start getting a small leash!<br>  and then it would be easier to pull his leash!<br>  and u might want to punish him until he learns his lesson<br>  but dont worry ive seen other dogs do it!<br>  but he might get sick is he carries on and mabye u should try a new command instead of leave it|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I heard from many poop eating dog owners that a couple of tablespoons of pineapple in the food will help.<br>  <br>  Sorry start buying pineapple by the truck load and chase down every critter and dole out the pineapple. J/K LOL|`|F27az9NEaa	Perhaps use a squirt bottle when you see him eating the poop? <br>  Curbing this habit is pretty hard, I have a dog who indulges in his own feces.<br>  There are a few theories as to why dogs eat poop (whether it be their own, or others): It's a learned behavior (watching the mother do it as a pup, or seeing their owners scoop poop), they're doing it for attention, or they've learned that poop tastes great and sometimes there can be food in it! (that's if the feces they're eating is from a dog who eats low quality food)<br>  I can't tell you why your dog is doing it, since I can't figure out why MY dog is doing it. But I've tried a few tricks with my dog (unfortunately he is stubborn, they've all failed);because he's eating his own poop it's a bit easier for me. I've tried 'Forbid', the "leave it" command, Pineapple, cleaning the yard more often, it's just a difficult task.<br>  <br>  <br>  Only thing I could suggest is using a halti-lead while on walks. This way when you notice he is going to eat the poop, instead of pulling his whole body away, the lead will turn his head and may divert him from getting to the feces.<br>  Good Luck
mOayTJDmaa	Introduce them in neutral territory.  Like the kitchen table.  That way they won't think any mouse is intruding.|`|wigtXCBTaa	They might|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Mice are a social species and do need the company of their own kind. They generally do well in groups - I had 9, and I have also looked after groups of up to 15!<br>  <br>  Females are usually pretty easy to introduce. Do it on neutral territory, eg on a table top or bed, or in an empty bath tub. The cage must also be neutral territory before you put all the mice together into it. You can either buy a new cage for this, or you need to thoroughly clean your existing cage (scrub everything, the floor, bars, etc).<br>  <br>  Make sure your cage is actually big enough for the number of mice you want to keep in it. Lack of space is a common cause of fighting. It can also help to have more than one water bottle, a number of different hideys etc. so they don't have to compete for anything. Either use more than one food bowl, or scatter feed instead (mix the food in the bedding). This prevents them fighting over the food, and means no mouse can stop the others from eating.<br>  <br>  You can house one male mouse with any number of females. But ONLY one male if housed with females otherwise they will fight.<br>  However, your male needs to be neutered to do this - otherwise all of your girls will produce a litter every 3 weeks!<br>  <br>  For the best mouse info check out this site. It also has a great forum where you can find loads of info on everything from cages, to neutering males, etc.<br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutmice.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutmice.co.uk/</a>|`|QQgftTxxaa	two males will definitely fight, two females may fight a minute or two but it wont be anything serious.

Feeding high quality canned food usually helps with urinary flare ups in females.|`|wq6lfHIBaa	Just as some mothers make homemade baby food for their babies, you can make healthy food for your cat at home. For optimal health, cook meat, chicken or fish with finely chopped vegetables. Sometimes I cook the meat in a bit of broth to make it even more flavorful. Cook enough to last a number of days or even the entire week and store in a plastic container. Since your cat will be getting lots of nutrients from these healthy meals, she will probably need to eat less than he normally does.|`|pw8u5WQ9aa	Hmm how about the purina cat chow??

L22hVXTIaa	He had probably eaten grass which is what dogs eat when they have a stomach upset.  I wouldn't be too worried at this point.  Just keep an eye on him.  If he continues to vomit, or has diarrhea for more than a day, then you should see a vet.  But at this point, it doesn't sound serious,.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sounds like grass. Has he been wormed and does he eat twice a day. Any fragments from his toys can upset his tummy too.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	he ate grass, dogs eat grass to settle an upset stomach|`|4bb411fe8f2ea252a5857d6f647a6233aa	Dogs eat grass.  There are a number of reason they do this.  They actually need veggies in their diet so if he is eating a heavy meat/protein diet his body made be craving some greens.  They also eat grass to purge their stomachs.  If they have an upset stomach they will eat the grass and then throw it up.<br>  You should be very careful about which grass they eat so that they are not eating some that could have been fertilized or bug sprayed.|`|wU94PVW1aa	He threw up grass I assume.  He probably knew he was feeling sick and ate some grass so he could throw up.  He should be ok, but keep an eye on him and take him to the vet in a couple of days if he's still unwell.|`|AA10500537	make sure it didnt get into anti freeze .<br>  have you had it checked|`|491EQELVaa	That is GRASS! A dog will eat grass when their stomach is upset.  You may want to watch your dog while he is outside to make sure he doesn't eat too much grass (this can make their stomach's even MORE upset). Eating grass can also be a sign of a lack of fiber in your dog's diet. You may also want to try switching his food. He may have a food allergy that causes his stomach to get upset. Try a wheat free, corn free and soy free dog food. It will be more expensive but it is worth it! All of my dogs and cats are on wheat/corn/soy free diets. Much healthier! And please don't just switch foods, you want to do a 1-2 week transition period. Gradually mix more of the new food in with the old one. You don't want to make the stomach upset any worse.|`|gftV8s84aa	It could have been grass. If there's any grass not covered in snow where you live. Dogs eat grass when they have an upset stomach. I don't know why, but my dogs do it a lot in the spring.summer. They're always getting into stuff they shouldn't be, and that's their way of "helping" themselves get rid of it and back on track. Otherwise, does your dog have any green chew toys? He may have ingested part of a toy.

XK9RLaPeaa	It is difficult to sex a bunny that young. But the vet will be able to tell you. As for getting them neutered/spayed, I would definitely wait until they were around 4 months old. If you get them fixed too soon, it will stunt their growth. They arent mature enough yet. But I think the vet was just saying he could sex them for you, and if indeed you have a male, you could make arrangements (at a later date) to have him neutered. And its great that you are getting them fixed. Most people wont spend the money to do it. But it increases their life span, makes for better temperament, and prevents certain cancers. It shows you are a good, well prepared owner. Good luck!|`|XI2iylR4aa	I think four-six months is usually an appropriate time to get your rabbits neutered.  <br>  <br>  I guess if you're going to the vet anyway, see what they say.  Some rabbits mature earlier.  If you notice any sexual behavior, I would keep the rabbits separated until they're neutered.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the buns!
R3E8DkTfaa	What you have is a case of brown algae.  You can scrub all you like, change water etc, and it won't help.  Brown algae is the result of improper lighting.  In order to keep this from coming back you need to buy new lights for your tank that have color temperatures close to that of natural sunlight.  That will take care of the problem.  Of course you will still need to clean the existing algae off of the surfaces of the tank and decorations.  Algae eaters don't usually eat brown algae so you will have to do this manually.  This shouldn't be the problem with your Betta's behavior.  That is another question entirely and you need to provide more information such as water chemistry to help us provide an answer for you.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	What ever you do, Never completely change the water (no more than 50 percent) and NEVER clean your tank or anything in your tank with anything other than dechlorinated water.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get some water testers especially for ammonia so you know when and how often to do a water change.|`|HRHPmjtVaa	Well, first is it beside a window? IT is probably algae. Do you have a heater? If not you need to get one. Bettas are tropical. Check your water's ph, Ammonia, Nitrates and Nitrites. Hope I helped!|`|355232ca109d88be6fb23e594e9e9813aa	Well, with the fish acting lethargic, it may be affecting him, research fish diseases like ick and see if he has any symptoms. Apparently a spore or two was missed when you cleaned the tank. Also, is it a filtered tank? Contrary to popular belief, bettas do live well in filtered water w/ currents just as well as they do in the unfiltered puddles of their origin. I would attempt to move him to a completely new tank for a little while, even one of the smaller ones. Then I would bleach/use soap to clean all of the original tank accessories. Rinse very well, about 15x more than u think is needed, then allow water to sit in it overnight, drain, rinse one more time, and start new. Of course, your beta just may be getting old as well. Don't use any of the products that put "beneficial" bacteria into the water at this point in time, seems like the tanks ecosystem cannot support it. Also, having the well water may be introducing the gunk, attempt to use filtered city water or buy the cheapest u can at wal-mart, all things used to treat water are generally designed to treat "city" water and balance the chemicals added to that, not to treat water filtered through the earth. Good luck!|`|dE8edvGIaa	YOU SHOULD NEVER COMPLETELY CLEAN THE TANK OUT. You remove all the useful bacteria which keeps the tank clean and he fish alive. You should only clean out a quarter or a third. If you clean it out fully, the fishes have chances of dying and theres no bacteria that gets rid of their waste so it just builds up. this is what has happened in your tank. And make sure you only clean it once a week cause cleaning it too often or too late also kills the fish. hope i help. x|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Never completely clean out your tank. You removed all the beneficial bacteria which breaks down fish waste. With nothing to break it down it becomes ammonia, which can spur algae growth. Your tank is cycling. <br>  <br>  Lethargy in fish can be caused by the presence of ammonia which is lethal. Betta's are also commonly lethargic because owners don't realize that they are tropical fish and require an aquarium heater to maintain their water temperature between 77F-82F.<br>  <br>  You should be performing weekly partial water changes of about 25%|`|mOayTJDmaa	You need a better filter.  Is it just a betta in the tank or what else?  How big?  Usually no more than 25% of the water is removed at one time.  And you need to do partial water changes weekly.
XVmjVP55aa	I have the same problem but with a 90 lb dog...NOT FUN!! The one thing that has really help far more than discipline is socialization. I have actively taken him around people but away from the house where he is less territorial such as the park or even a dog park. I bring him with me when I go to visit people. This interaction with other dogs and people away from the home and yard he is obsessed with protecting has made him far less aggressive at home. This could help you too :)
Z9zzNYNCaa	INVITING PLAY!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	when allowing two dogs to meet only allow them to sniff butt to butt at first. if your dog exhibits undesireable behavior during this separate them until he calms down and then try again. work on basic obedience with him. try walking him with other dogs without letting them meet.|`|AA10500537	it;s normal i have  people who walk  5 by my house and if i;m outside with my sheltie   the pitts do the same thing .,<br>  they are  very nice and well trained pups|`|AoSeHXeQaa	My rat terrier does that when he is trying to play.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	He's playing!  I have a pittie mix who loves to wrestle and box!  He also likes conning the other dogs into chasing him - his favorite game!<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that dogs "mouth" when playing...don't let them do this to a human, but it's a good way of playing with dogs.|`|EeTJ1CEHaa	sounds like he is playing and inviting the other dog to get to know him|`|L22hVXTIaa	He is definitely inviting play!|`|OxFsslN8aa	Dogs greet one another by sniffing the other butt.

8fPW2iWcaa	When I first brought my ferret home, my cats acted kind of skittish towards it.<br>  But over time they grew accustomed to each other, and now role around and play fight with each other all the time!<br>  Just give it some time, and at first let them meet under supervision, to avoid the chance of any attacks (and by that I mean the ferret attacking the cats.) <br>  Ferrets are normally used to kill animals such as rabbits in the wild, so you dont have to worry about the cats one up-ing him!|`|AA11593169	Good luck getting your cats to do anything they don't want to! Cats are not trainable like dogs. They tend to have a lot more attitude and do their own thing regardless of what you want them to do. But the idea of allowing them to get used to the new animal's smell in a safe way is a great suggestion. Good luck!|`|Ql6qFk85aa	Try putting the cats on one side of a closed door and the ferret on the other so they have a chance to get used to each others' smell.  This technique is often used when introducing a new cat to your original cat.|`|yIBSIgoCaa	it isnt cats nature to get along with small animals.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	rub him with catnip?|`|wigtXCBTaa	Fillet it
L22hVXTIaa	Until your dog has had it's full series of vaccinations, it's never a good idea to take them anywhere unnecessarily.  Your pup will probably be fine around the cats.<br>  <br>  But, just realize that diseases like Parvo are airborne.  And puppies are highly susceptible.  Parvo virus can live in the soil for up to a year, and dogs can get it simply by smelling the feces of an infected dog.<br>  <br>  I know, we're talking cats here, but just be very careful where you take your pup until she's fully vaccinated.|`|4PQc7UWUaa	Well you had to do injections when she was in 45 days and repeat it 21-28 days after last injection and you are late, ok , but you have to quarantine your dog and as soon as possible do injections.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	There's no cross-species virus except rabies to freak about. <br>  <br>  WHY do you have an UN-VACCINATED& TOO YOUNG pup????<br>  Oh,got from a cheapazz lazy  ignorant BYB ? Gotcha.|`|KuUx34hCaa	puppies should NOT be exposed to any thing until after they get their vaccinations other wise you risk the change of diseases|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Yes- it will be fine.  Just watch the pup around the cats.  She may get scratched for trying to investigate too closely.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	unless your cat has parvo it would be fine, dogs cannot get the same illnesses as cats like leukemia. just be sure to closely supervise until they are comfortable around each other
ZYqiay65aa	You were right not to spay her while she was having a false pregnancy as otherwise the false pregnancy will never stop.  If she's back in season/ false pregnancy at the moment the best option is probably to try medical treatment again and get her spayed.  I don't know what drug your vet used but the most common drug does cause lethargy and nausea but these effects usually go away after a bit so you could give it another go, as she will be better for it in the end.  Otherwise your vet should be able to recommend some other less commonly used alternatives which might not make her sick.  Unfortunately herbal remidies are unlikely to work as she needs to be given the right combination of hormones to stop her false pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If she just has the mastitis now she could be treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatories from your vet to clear the infection up. You can also massage the affected gland/s and apply warm compresses to try and keep her comfy.  I don't know of any herbal treatments which would be effective.<br>  <br>  I hope she's back to herself soon.|`|F27az9NEaa	You should've had her spayed at 6 months.<br>  And it's spelled DalmatiAn.<br>  <br>  If you don't think the medicine is working, you need to consult with your veterinarian.<br>  We cannot diagnose your dog here. And you don't have to wait until her next season to have her spayed, just get it done.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Getttttt Errrrrrrrrr Dunnnnnnn ASAP|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	This is one of the good reasons to get all pets spayed & neutered long before they mature.  This could turn into cancer very easily.  With so many ignorant breeders out there that don't know a damned thing about the genetics breed dogs with very strong negative traits.  You can blame the breeders of this dog.<br>  <br>  I am almost positive that your Vet recommended to get her spayed.  & right now it looks like your only choice.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Um, ya I have a remedy.<br>  <br>  It is called "spayed."  Look into it.
4TX26viFaa	I had good luck with Fromm with food allergies with one of ours till they tweeked their ingredients again. With ours I suspect a reaction to some of the preservatives used.  He's on Royal Canin Siamese 38 now (which stopped the bulemic cat from tossing his undigested food as well).  <br>  <br>  Look for foods with few ingredients in, if at all possible.  You might want to try the RC Siamese 38.   The other that ours did excellent on was the purina Venison & Potato, then they switched out the potato for chick pea and he was yanking mouthfulls of fur out within 30 minutes of eating it.|`|LURQBU86aa	If you think that it's chicken go to the pet store and look for a brand without any chicken or poultry in it. He could possibly be allergic to grains so try a grain free food such as Wellness Core or Evo.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Try California Natural Herring & Sweet Potato.|`|AA10859773	You can accomplish pretty much the same feeding trials your vet might suggest.  You just start by eliminating the most likely problem.<br>  <br>  Grains are the most common but it's not unheard of for cats to develop problems with chicken.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get him off grains and off chicken.  It's not that difficult.  If you feed canned food you'll have a lot more choices.  See this link for suggestions:  What to feed:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/commercialcannedfoods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/commercialcannedf...</a> <br>  <br>  Many of the brands listed there offer novel proteins, which simply means unusual meats like venison, lamb, duck, etc.<br>  <br>  For dry foods you don't have a lot of options.  Almost every dry food out there, including those that claim to be rabbit or whatever, still contain chicken.  So if you really need to get away for that, my only suggestion is to try Natural Balance Duck & Green Pea.  It's a decent dry food and although it's not grainless it's not bad.<br>  <br>  Another vote for canned food is that it's more easily digestible.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, remember to make dietary changes slowly so as to avoid further digestive upsets.  But in your case, I think you can speed things up a bit.  When you're changing foods to fix a problem such as yours, you sometimes see immediate improvement when the "bad" food is removed.|`|poEJEuwNaa	I'm not sure what you have tried and not so far, but one food intolerance issue in cats is with gluten, which is found in wheat. Wheat is used as a filler in a lot of cat foods. Check the labels and see if it is in the one your cat can eat now. If it is, then you can rule that out. If not, then look into the gluten issue further. I don't really think the issue would be with chicken though. When we were going through this with our cat we fed her boiled chicken breast (on vet's recommendation) while we were trying to eliminate other things.|`|QRBi7feQaa	try wet food instead of dry or try mixing wet with dry or like with cat she can only stomache the cheap stopand shop brand and only half a cup 2-3 times a day|`|LydKH6O4aa	mice with salad|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Try either the California Natural Herring, or Natural Balance Duck and Pea.  I'd suggest trying the NB Duck and Pea first.  There are also some canned foods that are alternative protein sources.  Instincts makes a rabbit, and a venison.  EVO has a venison one, but it's hard ot find.  Whatever the food you're feeding, read the ingredients carefully as some of them will say "rabbit" but if you read the ingredients list, you'll see chicken on there as well.  You want a single source of protein.<br>  <br>  The tests are costly, and you'd need to do a food trial anyway, so I don't think you're being remiss in any way by not having the tests done.  If you find a food that works, that's the important thing.
L22hVXTIaa	Cooked fish is fine but raw fish especially wild caught can contain parasites and your dog can also get the thiamine deficiency which can lead to loss of appetite, seizures, and death.  Also, never feed salmon since it can lead to "Salmon Poisoning Disease" which can also be deadly if left untreated.<br>  <br>  However, a single piece of sushi on the floor shouldn't cause problems unless it contained Salmon.|`|stCyrS4Eaa	Dogs can have trouble with raw Salmon. One small piece that hits the floor should not cause a problem.

SzW9GmRsaa	Veterinary medicine is now more difficult to get into than both law and medicine.  You will need consistently high grades in GCSE and A level, and whatever is above A level.  My friend's daughter got in with 5 Highers (all As), 4 Advanced Highers (all As), plus 9 Standard Grades (all 1s).  Her friend did not get in, with 5 As at Higher and 2 As and a B at Advanced Higher.  Aside from exceptionally good grades you need a good personality, a kick ar$e personal statement and references, and something that makes you stick out against everyone else who wants that place.<br>  <br>  This girl is in third year and only just getting a look at horses now.  In the first two years they look at other animals.  She will have many other specialities to study, and then work in a more general setting, before attempting to get a job as an equine vet.<br>  <br>  There are so many animal mad teenagers who want to be a vet, but do be aware of what it actually involves.  You will not be caring for well animals!  You will from time to time meet some lovely animals for vaccinations and pre-purchase vettings, but there will be thousands more sick, sorry, laminitics, grass sickness victims, broken legs, assaults, births gone wrong, whatever, all of whom need quick and attentive care and split second decisions, or a quick and attentive injection to end their life.  You will have to put horses to sleep.<br>  <br>  I certainly couldn't do that, and I think you should think strongly about whether you could, because it's an essential part of the job.  I'm sorry to be a downer but it does have to be said!  If you think you can hack it, buckle down and work incrediby hard at school!  Good luck.|`|an1L8njXaa	My friend applied for vet medcine. she has A grades at A level for biology, chemistry, maths and french. she has worked at a vets as an assistant shince she was 14, she has been lambing, worked on farms had a kick *** personal statement and still didnt get in to any of the places she applied to.|`|jUjkvis8aa	Just a warning- before you specialize, you will have to deal with all types of animals, not just horses. Also equine vets are a very popular career choice so you have to be the best of the best.<br>  <br>  The A-Levels you have to take are Chemistry and Biology, then either Physics or Maths.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|qNuynJNLaa	Well, I'm not sure but I'm also interested in this career, so I researched it on the internet as part of homework in school, I found out to get onto the course you need ATLEAST 5 GSCE's of A*- C & this MUST include A type of science, Maths & English, but you need to work with ALL types of animals before you'll be able to specialize in horses, I found that very irritating when I read that!

svrFBaENaa	You have a couple of issues here... The best way to treat Ich is aquarium salt. Problem is your tetras can't tolerate much salt in their water... they also have small scales and require smaller doses of medication or it could be toxic to them.<br>  <br>  I would separate your tetras into a different tank. I would then treat the Mollies and Swords with a lot of aquarium salt. 1 teaspoon for every 2 gallons. They can tolerate a lot of salt. And salt is the best medicine for Ich.<br>  <br>  I would treat the tetras with Methylene Blue and elevated temperature. Melafix would be useless, and quick cure contains formalin, which is very dangerous to tetras... Methylene Blue is considered the standard treatment for external parasites on small scale fish.<br>  <br>  Side Note for Guppy Fan:<br>  Ich has three stages in it's life cycle. Only one is visible. Even though fish may not appear to have Ich, if one fish in the tank has it, chances are everyone else in there has it as well. And not treating them could lead to more outbreaks.|`|mOayTJDmaa	Remove the filter cartridge.  Try to separate the fish that have ick and those that don't.  Raise the temp to at least 80 degrees.  And use treatment from the store.  Since you have tetras, the bottle will tell you to use half the dose.|`|H0fXySX9aa	they have white spot or ich<br>  you need to go and buy ich treatment for them and follow the instructions<br>  i would do a 25% water change first and then re,move any carbon you might have in your filter and treat|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You need to raise the temperature of your aquarium and purchase ich treatment. Follow the directions on the medication.|`|hNRPQWqBaa	just remove the cartridge while your treating them, they should be okay:)  <br>  while you are treating them with ich meds, raise the temperature in your tank(warmer water speeds up the life of ich, so they die faster).  also, it would probably be a good idea to add some aquarium salt to your tank.<br>  <br>  good luck, and i hope i helped!

4SQx8smEaa	The guinea pig WILL kill the hamster..|`|5l43F1x7aa	I dont think that the guine pig would like the hamsters company and could end up hurting the hamster.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Absolutely NOT - it is never recommended to keep different species in the same cage.<br>  <br>  For a start guinea pigs are much larger than hamsters and need far more space (at least 7.5 sq feet). There is no way you could fit a guinea pig in a hamster tank - this would simply be abuse. Guinea pigs should not live in tanks anyway (regardless of size) because the ventilation is inadequate. This leads to a build up of ammonia which causes health problems.<br>  <br>  Secondly, hamsters (Syrians) are a strictly solitary species. They do not need, want or even like company and should always be housed alone. Keeping these two animals together would cause them both a lot of stress - and one may attack and injure the other.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, they have different dietary needs. Hamsters are a foraging species, whilst guinea pigs are a grazing species and strict herbivores. Guinea pigs need to eat timothy hay, guinea pig pellets with vit C added, and fresh veggies. Hamsters need hamster food. It is impossible to keep them together and make sure they both get a proper diet. Either one or both would end up with serious malnutrition, and possibly end up dead.<br>  <br>  Fourth - they need different things in their homes, the obvious example being a running wheel. I would never keep a hamster without a wheel because they will run for many miles every night. Wheels are great for preventing boredom and ensuring your hamster gets enough exercise. Guinea pigs on the other hand should NEVER be given a running wheel because they are not flexible enough to use them safely and can break their backs.<br>  <br>  Please, please try to keep these animals separate. There is absolutely no way of housing them together without causing serious suffering and maybe even death.
AA12083992	Instead of going to a website and supporting puppy mills and /or back yard breeders, why not check out your local shelters?

Though Goldfish are coldwater fish...NO ONES HOUSE is gonna get near the cold temperature that Goldfish desire and once they have been in warmer temperatures...goldfish learn to adapt!  I have tank that has Goldfish, Swordtails,Guppies & Platies.  Though no heater is in the tank..the other tropical fish have adapted just like the goldfish have.  The livebearers breed constantly though I have to move the pregnant females so the fry can survive but other than that....everyone in the tank is fine. The only fish that should not be housed with Goldfish are fin nippers & agggressive fish such as cichlids. During feeding time...Goldfish get pellets made for them and the livebearers get a mix of flakes that the goldfish can eat too!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Other goldfish or weather loaches. Because of their temperature requirements as a coldwater fish they cannot be mixed with tropical fish.<br>  <br>  -Fancy goldfish should be kept with other fancy goldfish.<br>  -Handicapped goldfish such as celestials or bubble eyes should be kept together and not mixed with other varieties.<br>  -Common/comet goldfish should be kept together.<br>  <br>  All animals have a specific environment in which they thrive, and they shouldn't have to adapt to fit another, especially if it sacrifices their health.<br>  Goldfish should not be kept above 74F. Most tropical fish thrive between 77F-82F. Keeping one fish in the others temperature is sacrificing ones health. A goldfish kept at higher temperatures will have a faster metabolism, and a reduced lifespan as a result. A tropical fish not kept at correct temperatures will be more at risk to disease.|`|7erjLpuWaa	Elizabeth answered this question right on.  In addition, white clouds can be added to an unheated tank.  They can live in a wide range of water conditions and temperatures as they are not a true tropical fish and prefer temps under 74. They are a schooling fish, so get at least 6.  Personally, I think weather loaches are very cool.<br>  **Whoever gave the thumbs down is an idiot.<br>  "The white cloud mountain minnow is an extremely hardy fish that can withstand a wide range of temperatures.

Cats are naturally curious and he'll most likely be sniffing around the door. Give the kittens a blanket to sleep on so their scent gets on it and then bring it out and put it in Thor's favorite place. Once the first few days are up place Thor in the room that the kittens were in and let the kittens out to explore. Do this a couple more times, and then let them meet face to face. Stay with them and supervise them. If the don't seem interested at first don't force them to sniff eachother or be near eachother. They'll get to know eachother at their own pace.

Has he urinated lately?  If his bladder is full an he cannot urinate that could be the problem too.  Make sure he's comfortable and warm and call a vet as this could be a pain response thing too.  You wouldn't want him to be in pain in his last days.  There are meds you can get from a vet for him.   Make his last days the best you can.  God Bless.|`|Rpj9qArgaa	Maybe its time to let him go? Dogs don't show pain like people. Their instinct is to not show distress. It would make them vulnerable in the wild. It's something they carried over from days of the wolf.|`|8eDZcIPraa	sad as it is if he is hurting   put him down<br>  damn that hurts!|`|cnZlMojUaa	I'm sorry you are facing this. My little dog was 11 when she had bladder surgery to remove a cancerous growth. The cancer medications went toxic and caused her kidneys to fail and she passed away. I understand this is very hard. You are doing the right thing taking him to the vet to have the lack of appetite and shaking addressed. My dog would get urinary tract infections and shake. Shaking is one way dogs express pain. Dogs also stop eating when their bodies begin to shut down.<br>  <br>  You and your vet may want to check his blood work to check organ function, examine the urine for infection, and/or do X-rays/ultrasound to determine if the cancer has spread. Be prepared in case you don't get the news you want to hear. The vet may have ways to help manage his pain, but your beloved dog may be nearing the end of his earthly journey. You will find strength to do what you must. I hope you will get good news.
pcCfHYeSaa	awww that's cute! I like it :-)<br>  <br>  Have fun with you puppy!|`|89512b4a439d6f311cd06b16d97c9b22aa	I think its cute,  I like different names, all my dogs have different names, 2 of them are named from the girls on charmed, Piper, prue, pocket , Link, and Ohna.. The more different the better.|`|VBT3Itffaa	Lyra is totally cute.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	I think it's a very cute name! Unique and sweet!<br>  Good luck with your new puppy!|`|mRevWUxlaa	Thats a cute name. Lyra! Very unique!!! =)|`|2G6b5y8Taa	Lyra that is a cute name for a yorkie|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	that's pretty neat. I really like abnormal names. but I also don't like to think of names before I get to know the personality of the animal|`|JMnp9lgyaa	Lyra is cute, I have a shih-tzu her name is Lila|`|QvF7ZJibaa	it is different, maybe lilly or maddie, leah<br>  hopes this helps :)
qvWbPZrdaa	listen...the obvious thing to do is bring it to a vet....if its an aquatic turtle, its probably dehydrated, it could possibly die, unless its like a hardcore turtle like a snapping turtle that can stay out of water for 2-3 weeks, you have to bring your turtle to the vet, its common sense|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	That is one reason I recommend that turtles be left in their tanks and not taken out for exercise or play. As far as the turtle not eating, it is still probably a bit traumatized. If it goes another week without eating, tempt it with something yummy, like a small live earthworm. And leave your turtle in the tank unless you have to take it out for a major cleaning.
0QZgZbLRaa	Male hamsters typically have an extended bottom (can't think how else to phrase that.) Girls have a more rounded bottom shape and smell less. You don't need to pick them up to be able to notice this. Hope that helps.|`|qbvjOFvHaa	sometimes the only way to tell is to take it to the vet or to the store that you bought him/her at|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	only way is to pick it up.|`|vQWZx5Yuaa	if you dont want the babies you can just give them to the store you bought it from
AA10500537	if you know  how to care for them and they are in good health  i see no reason you can;t have  another litter.<br>  they are all going to family.<br>  GO FOR IT.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I hate to say it to you, but this is what the definition of a BYB is. Not really papered, not really purebred, and accidental breeding. Selling the puppies. Did you know that you are a business if you do this? You need a business license if you are going to continue breeding and any income from sales is taxable.If you have females and two intact males, you invite dominance wars. Accidental breedings can be avoided. In all the years I was showing my dogs, all breedings were intentional and I was there. It is OK to love your babies, they just don't need to reproduce.|`|L22hVXTIaa	You may not be a bad person, but if you REALLY love dogs, you are (at minimum) acting irresponsibly.  <br>  <br>  You have already had what your term an "oops" litter and are planning more.  That is never a good idea regardless of what you're breeding.  You have no idea which of your dogs is the father.  And, as to them being CKC registered - that is a sham of a registry and anyone can get a dog registered with them regardless of its parentage.<br>  <br>  Have your dogs been screened for genetic defects?  Have any of them won titles for their conformation?  Are you in this to promote the breed?<br>  <br>  If the answer to any of those questions is "no" - then you shouldn't be breeding your dogs.|`|8FbJjRpwaa	soz im not in America...why would you be a bad person? ~|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It is bad because you are doing it for the money.  Are they health tested?  (Not just checked by a vet) have you shown in conformation? How do you know you are producing quality pups?  I hope by CKC you mean Canadian Kennel Club and not Continental KC, because that is a sham registry for dogs who can't be registered by a reputable service like the AKC.  Dogs are not personal ATM machines and no dog should be bred more than once a year and not more than four litters total for any b****.  Any money you earn must be reported for taxes, even if it is not a business, it is money you have earned.
S2omQ1Cdaa	i think u shuld do miracle and clover cuz those names r more original thn angel and molly|`|Rpj9qArgaa	I don't know your dogs. How can I say what suits them? It might be better to name them Butch and Devil Dog for all I know.<br>  No No No you didnt ask what could be good names for your dogs. You asked if these names "Suit" your dogs. There is a huge difference. You don't name a dog Angel if it's mean.

Clover is the most unique and the one I like the best.|`|1cFA5hpfaa	I like angel and molly.  Miracle, not so much.  Unless it was like a miracle dog that survived being hit by a car or something.  But for just a regular dog that you bought, no.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	I really like Angel and Clover. They sound like they go together, Angel for the poodle and clover for the schnauzer.   <br>  <br>  : )|`|sQFnEgMxaa	I think the names clover and molly are better than the other two =)|`|RehgySLCaa	Molly, angle and miracle don't really roll off the tongue.|`|2G6b5y8Taa	i like molly and clover|`|6xmIPYimaa	i like miracle and molly :)
491EQELVaa	You need to make sure to contact the local vets and shelters in your area. Also post a LOST ad on craigslist. Talk to your neighbors! They should be willing to help you keep an eye out for your kitty.<br>  <br>  So your cat is a female. Is she old enough to be in heat? She could be around looking for a mate. You should go out at night and listen for meowing. (Cats are normally nocturnal.) Un-neutered males can smell females (even if they are fixed) and they are EXTREMELY vocal when they are searching them down. Once you get your cat back, get it FIXED!<br>  <br>  I really hope you find your kitty~|`|DtkLsetkaa	Contact your local shelter/vets offices, and leave them a picture and your contact information.  I am assuming she wasn't microchipped?  Oh, and be prepared to be a daddy when she comes home.  Its most likely that she escaped because she is in tact and wanted to mate.  Having her spayed could have avoided this.  Just make yourself as reachable as possible and make sure your local shelters know your cat.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	well, if your cat does come back she is probably going to be pregnant so you will want to get her spayed right away.<br>  <br>  did you call all shelters and vet's offices in about a 30-50 mile radius?  call them every day.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	She will probably return after she has mated.  You really need to take her to a vet, not only to have her spayed, but she may have picked up things like worms.  She might also be beaten up.<br>  <br>  Other than notifying animal control and checking shelters, you could sit in the yard and simply read something.  She may come to the sound of your voice.<br>  <br>  Good luck, but please, when she returns, get her spayed.  She will then stay close if she gets out again.  (And for most people, having an unspayed cat in the house is unpleasant.  They often spray.)|`|pw8u5WQ9aa	Wow that is a very long time for your cat to be gone. Have you tried the shelter? It is definitely time to get the kitty fixed. Thats one of the reasons cats run away. Good luck hope you find him.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Check with your animal control, like another user suggested.  Also, this might sound sound weird but there are people who train their search and rescue dogs to find missing pets.  See if you have any of those services in your area.|`|zpwJR60baa	Have you call your local animal control?  They may have picked him up already.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	Okaay, she's un-fixed right? She's running around getting knocked up! lol jk jk  <br>  <br>  On the serious side of things, call the humane society. It sounds like you've done everything in your power so far. I'm sorry you lost you cat. That's really hard to deal with. But sometimes unfortunately, animals run away and they don't come back. Keep trying! You sound like a wonderfull pet <br>  owner and hopefully she'll come back.<br>  <br>  Oh yea- and please get her spayed. It is better for her and she won't run away again.|`|WcYRd9DLaa	you should have had that cat fixed,  forget it , now she or he is out screwing around, its there natuure.  good luck, but the answer would be, you screwed up.  i am totally baffled by people still refusing to fix animals, today it costs next to nothing, only a little effort and many rewards.  cats are much happier fixed, more lovable and more content.  also more healthy.  why dont these people see this.
LSz1IT6Eaa	Did your vet see your dog or just talk to you over the phone?  I have had dogs with kennel cough in the past and it never affected their energy nor eating habits. If your vet didn't see your dog or ask to see your dog, I might seek another opinion.<br>  <br>  I just read your response to another Kennel cough posting and on there you said that your dog is very wobbly on it's legs when it tries to stand-------if this is the case, you really should get your dog to a vet to be looked at.  Kennel cough should NOT make your dog this weak.  There may be other problems along with the Kennel cough or it may not be kennel cough at all.  I wouldn't wait.|`|AA12128656	well let the vet treat the dog then!!|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Kennel cough is common when the owners do not get the vaccine for them. I'm sure your vet is right on and knows the proper treatment|`|f6be38fa4f0a14b54a53885b1dcdae82aa	No. I have seen kennel cough and though it may make a dog gag, it really should not cause him to have no energy. Did the vet put him on any medication? I would get a second opinion from another vet.
UIM8X38Oaa	Yes, he Sounds like he is herd bound which would not be surprising because of the way he started out.  That is dangerous though as you know.  Are you using spurs on him?  I would say give them a try if he will not respond to your leg when he is going sideways then start to apply your spur and gradually add pressure until he moves off your leg.  If it is really getting hairy then I would get off and discipline him on the ground and then get back on.  It takes time I have worked with a lot of herd bound horses and you will just have to practice taking him out on his own alot.<br>  <br>  And spend time taking him for walks away from the other horses ALOT and romance him giving him treats, grass, and some rub downs etc.  whatever he enjoys so his time with you is pleasant and enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|sUN7TVtzaa	yeah i agree take out the harsher bit and tie down maybe he is used to lighter handling and you ride harder on him- im not saying that's bad hes just not used to it. take it easy on him. try staing in an Arena. take some lessons, we never stop learning! ride in groups if it keeps him calm. if he was wild then he is probably used to being in groups and being in charge of where he goes. now you demand he goes somewhere and he can't take that.<br>     instead try asking him to go there, if he says no then you make him circle and keep circling him and asking him until he decides that it is much better to go there willingly then to be forced to work. but don't be too harsh with him remember you are trying to avoid bullying him. <br>  <br>  another attempt is try join up. it makes you the leader but not by threatening, it is horse language that says " i am your leader and you can stay running or come and be with me" most times it works. you take the horse in a round pen and make him run around you. keep him running even when he is tired. when he flicks his ear toward you and lowers his head making a chewing motion with his mouth then you can turn your back on him and if it works he should walk up to you and even follow you!. i have read it works really well.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I had a gelding that would do this..quite frustrating.  First, a harsher bit is not the answer. He will concentrate on that and not you.  I would start from the beginning.  Use a snaffle and tie his head around to the stirrup (it gives). Turn him loose.  He will probably go sideways for awhile, until he learns to give to the pressure.  When he starts turning whatever way you have him tied, then undo that side and tie to the other side.  You need not tie short, just enough where he starts to turn his head. The stirrup, because it is hanging will give and pull without alot of pressure.  <br>  This will take him a day or two to get used to. Then get on him and try it again.<br>  You can also do this with a surcingle or saddle, run long lines from the bit thru the stirrups or side rings of surcingle and drive him.  Do this until he gives freely to the pulling.  Then get on him again.<br>  You should be able to ride without a tie down afterwards. But use a simple ring snaffle.<br>  I like just using the saddle and tieing the reins to the stirrups, the he self-teaches himself.  And if he starts jumping around, you won't get hurt. It is not stressful on him either.|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It sounds like he is herd bound which is a common issue.  If it is possible, you may need to separate him from his herd (different paddock/pasture) a little more of the time and then put him back in.  Letting him know that it is OK not to be with the herd and the will go back.<br>  <br>  You may also want to do more ground work with him, increasing the bond between you two and establishing more trust in you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|qoL7LTIUaa	work in an arena|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	my horse does the same thing, except he goes back wards and side ways running into trees and bushes and barbed wire fences. and he doent do it in groups either. i would say its because he doesnt want to go that direction. my horse would do it when we were crossing gravel, but that was because his feet were just trimmed and a bit sensitive. but he also does it when we are going on a trail becuase he doesnt want to. i would give him a llittle kick with my heels and he would keep going backwards,so i finnaly after trieng to get him to go and not succeding, i just starting whipping his neck with th reigns over anf over until he would go. and he kept doing this before that, so i knew it was not something in the woods. so finnal when he reliezed i wasnt gonna stop whipping him until he when on the trail, he went. so i kinda got that fixed. i had to keep turning him in circles so he would face the right direction lol. hes a little butt so i am just trien to fix this bad habit. but i think i am fixin it now lol. well i think that is what your horse is doing, avioding going forward. so yeah. well its good your working on it insted of leting him do it:) hope you and your horse have fun:) peace love?|`|SxRXoFxJaa	Don't use a harsher bit- that'll just piss him off. Use a snaffle or something. <br>  <br>  You should try lunging him before you ride him. <br>  He's just acting like a toddler, and he's acting out. <br>  <br>  You should try watching some horse training shows- Clintion Anderson. <br>  <br>  If he's dancing, and sidepassing, make him move his feet.<br>  <br>  Make him walk for a few steps, then make him go backwards. He won't like this, but you have to establish dominance in a nice way.<br>  <br>  LET HIM COMMIT TO THE MISTAKE. THEN FIX IT.|`|UX4BOaataa	Just a thought, but how are his eyes? Perhaps he has some sight issues, maybe not a bad sight problem, but maybe something that is starting up? Blind spot, floating blind spot, sensitivity to light v. dark? Good luck with solving the problem, I just thought I would add another issue out there that could cause a horse to act funny...|`|n7aBTKk0aa	Is he barn sour or buddy sour?<br>  <br>  Had a horse that would do this if you made him leave he would go sideways into anything. My leg and him have been cut by fence he would also rear up as well. I would get a trainer and work in an arena|`|eL268hETaa	How often is he ridden?  Sounds like he's barnsour.  I agree with the suggestion of horsetraining videos, but I prefer Monty Roberts to Clinton Anderson.<br>  <br>  Try getting off the horse and getting on the ground with a pocketful of treats.  Walk him with a rope halter or a halter with a chain over the nose for good control.  Bring a crop.  Start walking away from the barn where the trouble starts.  If the horse starts fighting to go back to the barn, wont listen to voice or tugging the lead rope, then get his attention with a good smack on the shoulder with the crop.  Lead him forward again, and give him a treat.  Reward the good behaviour, and continue this until he can travel a good distance from the barn without a fight.  Then progress to riding with a pocketful of treats.
0mb78CiWaa	Cats purr when they are happy and also when they are trying to heal themselves after an injury. They purr from a voice box in their throats.<br>  <br>  Here are som sites with more information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/catspurr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.acecathealth.com/cat_purr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.acecathealth.com/cat_purr.htm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catmanagement101/a/how_cat_work_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catmanagement10...</a>|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	that is why they purr the majority of the time but they also purr when they are in a lot of pain trying to comfort themselves.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	"Cats, (big and small) are the only animals who purr. Contrary to popular belief, purring isn't speaking. Some people believe the sound comes from two membrane folds, called false vocal cords, that are situated in the larynx behind the actual vocal cords. Cats purr 26 cycles per second, the same as an idling diesel engine. Cats purr both when inhaling and exhaling, keeping the mouth completely closed, and only stopping to swallow. Kittens are born blind and deaf, but the vibrations of their mother's purring is a physical signal that the kittens can feel. It acts as a homing device, signaling them to nurse. Kittens begin purring at about one week old; then it's a signal to the mother cat that they're getting their milk and are content. Since purring is non-vocal, it doesn't interfere with the suckling. Contrary to another popular belief, cats don't purr purely for pleasure. Be alert: a deep purr can indicate that a cat is in pain or distress. Female cats will purr when in labor. Cats may purr in fear or anxiety. They will also purr in anticipation of being fed or stroked. Big African cats only purr in short bursts, but the house cat can purr for hours."|`|VDP3pNCPaa	If the true answer were known, a lot of people who have nothing to do, since the mystery would be solved.<br>  <br>  About the main generality that can be thought of is that they are receptive to human touch when they purr.  That is because they purr when they are content, and can also purr when they know the end is near, and they are with a person they fell safe with.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, cat purr comes from their nerves under their vocal.

C1eHfhrHaa	There are tons of websites that can guide you in puppy care.  Make sure you are feeding a high quality puppy food (until a year old), enroll her in obedience classes as soon as her shots are complete (usually at 12 weeks), start leash training her.  Walk her to potty even if you have a yard until she understands that outdoors is the place to go.  This will also help you with leash training.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|XVmjVP55aa	I have a German Shepherd. He is amazing, but in the beginning there were challenges. GSD's are extremely intelligent and love to push the boundaries. In addition to normal puppy stuff, I would encourage you to start a puppy training class and then later a basic obedience class. GSD's love learning new things and they learn quick so dont hesitate to show your puppy as many new tricks as possible. Oh and another thing I noticed with mine is that he really made us work for his trust in the beginning so a lot of positive reinforcement and patience are required. Be sure, as your dog will be very big one day, to assert yourself and make it very clear at a young age that you are the master. This will make it a lot easier for you to handle her when she is full grown. Getting my GSD was the best thing I have ever done and I know you are going to be very happy with your choice. Please feel free to contact me if you have any bumps in the road or any further questions.

Until then check out this website!<br>  <br>  Hope they will survive!<br>  <br>  - True Horselover <(^o^)>|`|V8ia6OyZaa	you should take them to the vet. A.S.A.P!!<br>  and it was probably the cold!|`|7sb7QqAEaa	It was the cold!<br>  <br>  Warm them up as quick as you can, they need warmth to survive. Try a heating pad, or a lamp and warm them up, GENTLY, with your hands. If that doesnt work, give them a warm NOT hot bath, and that can help to revive them. Then go out and get some baby bird formula, because youll need to feed them every so often until their mom accepts them again.|`|USF8xNfhaa	LOOK YOU CAN STILL STOP THIS TAKE CHICK INSIDE PLACE IN BOX A HEATING PAD IF YOU HAVE ONE PLACE TOWELS TWO MAYBE THREE OVER PAD AND TURN ON HIGH PLACE CHICKS IN BOX AND COVER BOX TOP WITH TOWEL LEAVE ALONE Although it was 65 chicks dont have feathers to protect them and inside a dryer metal holds cold so it got a lit bit colder inside.

DtkLsetkaa	Your poor baby :(  This sounds similar to something that happened with my dog a few years back.  Turned out she was allergic to a medication she was prescribed and once we stopped it she started to recover (its a much longer and more expensive story than that, but that's a shortened version lol).  The meds were poisoning her liver which was causing blood toxicity levels to rise and making her vomit.  I hope the xray solves your problem and answers your questions.

IuYekkPVaa	The angle of the sun and his sense of smell helped him find his way home.  Cats have scent glands on their paws, so wherever they walk leaves a trail that they can follow.  Outdoors they'll also rub their faces up against things to act as scent markers, just like they do indoors.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	that's good that he came back.  I bet you won't make that mistake again.|`|zpwJR60baa	HI, Cat leave their scent for territorial issue.  Even if they are fixed or not.. they use their nose.

36emSLGWaa	A pet that is nursing shouldn't get any shots till after the pups have been weened off, try to aim for after you sell the puppies or whatever you plan to do. Since the pups are drinking for the mother, they are getting whatever is in the milk. It's almost like for us humans, if a mother is breast feeding, and whatever we eat or drink goes into the milk so it's the same with the puppies. So if she gets her shots, the medicine will travel into the milk which will also affect the puppies.

Be careful, if she were to struggle free, she could fall and break a leg or even her back.<br>  <br>  I'm sure she doesn't hate you.  If she hated you she would be biting, growling, thumping, etc.  Actually, I don't think rabbits are capable of hatred.  They are capable of fear, however.<br>  <br>  I would try to avoid letting anyone picking her up.  If she climbs up someone's neck and jumps off of their shoulder, she could get seriously hurt.<br>  <br>  When we need to move our rabbit, we put her in a cat carrier, and then let her out at her destination, even if we're just moving her from room to room.<br>  <br>  If I'm reading into it correctly, her flattening her ears might be a sign that she wants to be pet.  Does she also put her head down?  And softly grind her teeth while you're petting her?

juyA6HUJaa	There are mange mites which can't be seen and burrow under the skin, if they where normal mites you could see them on the fur easily, a little like nits on humans.<br>  If the piggie has mange mites it'll be itching and biting itself a lot, they get flaky dandruff like patches on their skin.. mostly around the bottom area and the bald patches behind their ears... also sometimes on the feet and legs. Mites can cause the fur to come out in patches or just come out all over a little more than usual when your petting them etc, they also somtimes stop being as active and might not eat or drink as much. Do not get a shampoo and bath her, that can cause even worse problems so thats a bad idea ^ there are ones you just rub round their neck area which kills mites easier than stressing it out and getting it cold in a bath! But then again... guinea pigs scratch sometimes, a few times a day is ok... if its a lot and you cant see anything she probably has mange mites.|`|JzAMcMzlaa	That's easy for you to check out.. if she does not bite, pick her up and put her somewhere that she wont really be able to move allot but will not be stressed and scared.. grab a small magnifying thingy and comb through the hair with a small brush while looking through it.. if you notice any small black dots ( even if they are not moving ) put her in the tank or cage ASAP! go to your local pet store and get something that will help kill fleas and ticks but wont hurt it. you will have to wash her coat so if she does bite run her under water or put water in ur hand and brush it on ur her to get to glop off. if you do not notice anything she might just have dry skin. you can get a soap/ shampoo for that. If she keeps scratching after that take her to a vet she might have worms. Those are the three reason why they will scratch|`|K4bJgTF4aa	most likely. take her to the vet...and get her some soothing cream. it really helps.|`|im4SbMP2aa	consult  vet at first priority mostly they catch mites from grass and mothers.|`|KQ3nu80Faa	LOL...get a better pet...is pig even a pet??maybe she doesnt have mites but she feels allergic wenever its around u|`|SqNoMz7vaa	That's exactly what my guiena pig did (when he was still alive, had him for about four or five years, don't remember!). He started scratching himself, then ran around his cage and made that funny noise,and then started scratching again! We took him to the vet after we noticed that all behind his ears there was skin skratched to blood! For some reasons the vet gave him like two or three injections and after about a week he was fine. So keep an eye on your guiena pig.
ux0wBOpcaa	well the drake "male duck" doesn't care for the eggs.. so yes you should probably put a bowl of water and make sure she never goes thirsty... and chicken grain should do the trick but if you guys cant get ahold of that then peas. my pet duck loves peas..stop feeding her bread because it clogs her gizzard...its like junk food for a duck...|`|FtBqmFDEaa	If the male duck is "swimming" nearby then obvioulsy there is water if she wants it. When birds go broody, ie sit on a clutch of eggs, they don't move all day apart from once maybe they feed, drink and poop. Then they sit tight.  She probably gets off to feed  and drink very early in the morning before its light properly to avoid predators. <br>  <br>  Too much bread is not ideal, it might get impacted in her crop and get she might get sick. She will be fine, try not to interfere too much.|`|rQlzfHqraa	You could leave some bird seed and water nearby her. It's better for her than bread.

0J1cYbXQaa	Train her in basic obedience and socialise her really well, take her for a nice walk and she should be fairly calm around the house, every Rottweiler I have owned has been calm and obedient with excellent manners but you have to teach them to behave this way. There is no need to shout or flap about as that will just make her more excited and she will think you want her to play. Use kind training methods, learn how to train her properly, do not shout at her or do anything else to cause her to feel stressed, it sounds like she is a lovely dog who just needs to learn some manners<br>  <br>  The following link may help <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apdt.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apdt.co.uk/</a>|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	If she is doing this for attention, the best thing to do is ignore her. When she sees it doesn't work she will stop. But, you do need to give her attention when she is doing things you like, such as lying at your feet or dropping a toy for you. <br>  <br>  To prevent her from being bored enough to seek attention in the first place, give her something to do when you are busy. Give her a treat-stuffed Kong or a Nylabone, for instance. Or exercise her first and then put her in her crate for a nap.|`|4TX26viFaa	You can slather Bitter Apple on them, or shake white or black pepper on them.

Puppies learn bit inhibition from their litter mates.  They learn how hard they can bite before the other pup turns back on them.  Puppy play is all mouth.  That is the way they investigate the world around them.  If you don't stop this now you will have worse problems later on.

Before you get on the phone, or wash up, restrain her to an area she can't get at you.<br>  If she is near you and starts, say a sharp "NO bite" and remove her to another area.<br>  Do this over and over, she will get the idea.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	you tell it firmly no every time it does it, ive a pup the same age i tell him im going to put him on the naughty lead he hates being on the lead in the house. now i just show him it stops him in his tracks every time|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	You have to be very firm. Tell her "NO!" in a very firm, low tone voice and growl at her. Don't worry what the neighbours would think. When she stops, praise her and put something else in her mouth. Be very consistent.

I just realized she a rotti... u there? hello ? you still there? hey if you can hear/read still... don't take any of my advice.. leave her alone!  Back Away From The Rotti... let her be,  she is acting like a cute lil puppy she is....see ya! <br>  <br>  I know this sounds unorthodox but honestly have you tried just seriously FREAKING OUT on her? Like when your on the phone and she starts "quickly" put down the phone. Turn towards your dog with arms waving every freaking which way and jump, kick some, yell out loud, bang something louder, scream, just really give it to her good! (trying this a few times faking your dog out that someone is really on the phone) Hopefully in time all you'll have to do is move your arm quickly (phone still in hand) and she will run run run! Next the problem with her biting your feet. This is the one I can't seem to come up with a solution as I have never heard of someones dog biting feet. Sorry can't help ya on that one. Good luck and start practicing... Remember when practicing it is so so so important that you don't let her know your faking her out that someone is on the phone... Otherwise this will never never work. My best to you. Good luck...|`|0uqsaxEqaa	Yes she is trying to get attention, but she needs to learn that you are top dog, and attention happens when you say. Whenever she bites at you, yelp as if you are another puppy and have been hurt (which you probably have been!) - she should understand that - and remove yourself from her, ignoring her until she stops bothering you - this includes not looking at her. Then, when she's stopped for a little while 10 seconds-ish to start with, but building up, praise her for having left you alone. Do it EVERY time she bites at you. It will get tedious, but she needs to understand.<br>  <br>  Once she's getting the idea of the yelping, add a firm NO! in after the yelp, so that she learns that word, and after a while you can leave off the yelping. Don't forget to praise when she does what you want though - that's really important.<br>  <br>  Rottis are intelligent dogs so it shouldn't take too long for her to get the hang of what you want. <br>  <br>  You don't say how old she is, but I'm assuming she's teething, so make sure that she has plenty of things to chew on - and if she picks something that she isn't allowed, always replace it with a legitimate chew toy. Also make sure that you spend plenty of time with her, and that she isn't bored - a bored dog just makes trouble!<br>  <br>  Finally I would strongly suggest that if you haven't already done so you find a dog training club and take her along regularly - preferably for at least a year... Rottis are lovely dogs, and two of the best trained pet dogs I've seen have been that breed, but the breed gets a lot of bad press, so it is up to you to make her a credit to both you and her breed. :)
XKNQkwuGaa	yes dogs do have a jealous nature and with my 3 they can get pretty upset if they think they are not being treated the same or one gets a treat and they gobble up theirs and want the others treat. ur little guys nose is out of joint because of the new pup so just give them the same amout of love and attention and as the pup gets older ur terrier should be more settled having him as part of the family. make sure the seeds are removed from the apples since they do have cyanide in them and can make ur dogs really sick .good luck|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	He isn't jealous, he is exhibiting dominant behaviour.<br>  How come you would get 2 males???|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Thats just normal dog behavior.<br>  In the dog world, someone elses food always tastes better, someone elses toy always looks better, and someone elses treat is the BEST :o)<br>  You just need to mediate.

So what i have tons of friends and a lot of them dont care and understand. so BLAH! and they are not nocturnal. well they sleep at dawn and dusk. DUH! and then also you can switch when they sleep if you want so BLAH AGAIN!)<br>  <br>  These are sort of my first rats,<br>  (bought a rat and then 2 weeks later it died :( I was very sad)<br>  But i got new ones and i have had these rats for over a month and i love them!<br>  Dont know how i lived with out them!<br>  <br>  They each have there own personallties. Its really cool.<br>  Also they have different tastes (well mine do. there a bit spoiled)<br>  <br>  <br>  Ya im not a big fan of the tail but you get used to it.<br>  I wanted a pet that wouldnt bite me<br>  (bad expericence with a bunny, lets just say we sold it and i was left with a bloody eye :( Im all better :) )<br>  <br>  They pracically never bite.<br>  <br>  Sorry i keep going on but i love rats and i want the world to see how nice and sweet they are, not some sewer rats :(<br>  <br>  They are very playful, and love when your around.<br>  <br>  Im teaching mine right now how to beg, then im going to litter box train them, (well im trying) <br>  <br>  There is a lot to them, more than people see.<br>  <br>  And you only can see it if you or your friend has one and you hold it and play with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  (you might think there gross, but wait itll you meet them.)<br>  <br>  Keep an open mind.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Rabbits are quite complex creatures to care for, and can get a lot of tooth problems and things.A lot of them do not like to be picked up to be hugged, and they can be quite kicky and scratchy.<br>  <br>  Chinchillas are quite wild, and need a lot of work in taming them. Even then, they wont "sit at your desk with you", they'll be off gallivanting, ripping your walls to shreds.<br>  <br>  Ferrets are as high maintenance as a cat or dog, and very expensive to keep and treat at a vet, again they are too hyper to sit at a desk with you.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest a pair of rats...you cant keep one, its cruel, but rats will run around and play and then come and settle with you. They love human interaction, in fact you need at least an hour a day to spend with them. You will need to watch your wires though, they're cable chewers. They will also need a big cage, like 80X50X80 and a high quality diet, like Oxbow regal rat or Science selective rat.|`|AA12352550	FERRET!!!|`|wigtXCBTaa	California Rosie Boa|`|oPrq7v7Saa	Don't listen to those others about chinchillas. You CAN train a chinchilla to sit with you, especially if you get a chinchilla as a kit (baby). I have a few that will sit and watch TV with me, follow me around the house, sit on my shoulder while homeschooling my children, lay with me on the bed, and even sit on my desk and watch me type on the computer! They are very social animals and love to interact with people, if you train them correctly and spend quality time with them. They ARE responsive to their name, but it can take a little while for them to get use to it if you don't say it very often. They ARE NOT dangerous and are small, curious, soft, loving, fascinating exotics. Chinchillas are nocturnal, but you can train a kit (baby) to be awake when you are and sleep when you do. All of my chinchillas are trained to be awake when I am. Chinchillas are fun animals to have and will do somersaults off the walls. They are very entertaining, but can be chewers. Not all chinchillas chew like everyone seems to think. Another point I would like to make is, people tend to think that chinchillas are climbers, but they ARE NOT climbers. They love to jump around instead of climb. With that said, I recommend a cage that id wide, NOT tall because chinchillas are very fragile and if they miss a jump it can and will kill them. If they don't die from the fall they will most certainly be injured. Feel free to check my website out and email me with any further questions you may have.|`|dIw1112Zaa	A bearded dragon! <br>  They don't really bite at all and if they do it feels like a pinch<br>  You can walk them<br>  They don't try to run away (unlike hamsters)<br>  They will sleep in your lap while you work<br>  Loves to be handled<br>  <br>  I do recommend get a juvenile or adult one though|`|aYLdSTNPaa	One thing I haven't notice anyone say on here is that before you choose a Ferret, be adviced that they stink really bad especially if you don't clean their cage out like every day!

And yet it can't be farther from the truth.  Now of course, it may be true for a rat you find in a New York City garbage can, but for the pet rat, it is the opposite.  They are usually very clean and healthy.  They are very friendly and will often enjoy human company and allow people to hold them.  As long as they're handled at a young age, they are pretty much social and non-aggressive.  However, if left isolated, they may attack out of fear and anti-socialism, but that is the owner's fault. <br>  <br>       As said before, rats are social creatures.  That's why it is best to get two rats.  Two males are not a good idea, because unless they are littermates, they will fight, possibly resulting in fatality.  Two females will usually not fight, but it can happen on a rare occasion.  A female and a male will definitely reproduce, and they will do it again, again and again.  They breed quickly, and sometimes in very large numbers, though many babies will die or be eaten. <br>  <br>       A good cage for rats would be a glass aquarium, or a large barred cage.  The bigger the better.  A cage good for two or three rats is a 20 gallon long aquarium.  For bedding, newspaper is your best choice.  It's cheap, it's easy to clean up, which is very important.  Rats poop a lot.  They will not stop.  You will need a medium sized water bottle, preferably two, but one will do.  Putting the bottle outside of the cage is best, as rats will sometimes chew holes in the bottles, which can be expensive.  You will need to provide a little hut for them to retreat to.  A shoebox or one from the store is fine.  Plastic tubs will also work, but may need t obe replaced from time to time due to chewing.  You can also put some toilet paper rolls in there for them to play with and chew on.<br>  <br>       Rats are omnivorous, which means they eat meat and plant.  They will eat just about anything.  You can feed them bread, hamster food blocks, hay, cheerios, seeds or pellets.  They will also need something to chew on.  The food blocks will help, but they'll need more.  If they don't chew enough, their teeth will grow too large and go through thier mouth.  You can buy little blocks at the pet store, or just find something for them. <br>  <br>       Rats cages should be cleaned about once a week since they poop so much.  They'll need fresh food and water daily.  The bedding should be changed about every five days.  Clean the water bottles and food dishes every couple of days as well. <br>  <br>       Overall, rats are very easy to care for.  They are very fun, and you can even teach them tricks.  They are perfect for breeding, and only live 2 to 4 years, so there's no big committment.  They're also very, very cheap.  Pet stores will try to sell you 'fancy rats', which are fit to be pets.  They are said to be tame and regularly handled.  They cost more, and you may want them.  Feeder rats, the ones that are fed to snakes and lizards, are cheaper.  They are generally very tame as well, and I don't see the difference in the two, except the cost.  The only thing is, feeder rats are sometimes kep in cramped conditions but not at a good pet store.  They're also sometimes bred out, meaning they've been used for thier young so many times that they probably won't give you a batch of babies.  The general rule is, if all of the rats in the cage seem healthy, then it's a safe deal.<br>  Next to dogs, then cats, ferrets are the most popular pet in America.  It is widely considered to be a 'wild animal', but it is actually domesticated.  Many people also believe ferrets are rodents, but they are not.  They are relatives of the weasel, mink, skunk and otter.  They are very lovable and playful, yet thier strong curiousity sometimes get them into trouble.  These animals require a lot of care, but it is worth it.<br>  <br>       Ferrets are not cage dwellers.  They do need to have cages, for when they are sick, sleeping, over aggressive or if you can not watch them or if you have company over.  They also sleep about eighteen to twenty hours of the day.  Then they will need three to six hours out of the cage to play and excercise. <br>  <br>       A ferret will need a large cage.  They can not live in glass aquariums, as this provides poor ventilation.  Cages are usually in the hundreds, but can go up to the thousands.  They should have at a minimum two square feet and about two feet in height, though you should go bigger.  If you have a large dog cage lying around, that's perfect.  Large may do, depending on the brand, but extra large, giant or even colossal is preferred.  In the cage there must bed some form of bedding.  Some people use alfalfa.  The best kind is some old blankets and sweatshirts.  Ferrets love to curl up into something while they sleep and this is perfect for that.  Do not use pine and cedar as it is toxic.  You will also need a food dish, a water dish and a water bottle|`|meKY251raa	Rat, you can train them, to do whatever you want !!<br>  <br>  Theyre brilliant, but you needa be paient with them !<br>  <br>  <br>  They can be dangurous, but only if you dont treat them well !!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The other thing i would reccommed is Hamsters . <br>  Not a Russian Dwarf ( i have two of these, well, 8 since one had pups) but these arent very good for sitting with you, well, they are but only if your holding them<br>  Syrian hamsters i love to bits !<br>  In your case these are the perfect pet. <br>  They are trainable, and love humans.<br>  I had 3 syrains hamsters, and all day they would sit on my shoulder!<br>  Once my one Stitch got out got into r kitchen, got some cheese, ate it and went back to his cage !<br>  Theyre lovely. <br>  I think Rats or Syrian hamster would be the best pet for you !<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped .. (:|`|JwpxsMhTaa	I went through this same issue a few years ago.  I didn't want a dog or cat, but at the same time I didn't want a nameless fish in a bowl.  Here are my lists of pros and cons for each:<br>  <br>  -Rabbit- <br>  pros:slightly trainable, responsive to name, diurnal (meaning they're awake when you are) unlike guinea pigs<br>  cons: deserve and need some attention.  Many rabbits thrive with people, time out of the cage and with other rabbits.  <br>  -Chinchilla- <br>  pros: easy to take care of, un-smelly<br>  cons- they're nocturnal.  For someone who is interested in seeing their pet, this should be a huge turn off.<br>  -Ferret-<br>   pros: smart, playful, funny to watch<br>  cons: can be a bit smelly and like rabbits, require time to play<br>  -Rat- <br>  pros: curious, small and more intelligent than generally given credit for.<br>  cons- Heavily social creatures and to be fair to the new pet, you'd really need to adopt a playmate as well.  Also, like the chinchilla, many types of rats are nocturnal.  There is also generally a stigma against rats so your friends might think you're a bit weird when they come over.<br>  <br>  In the end, I would go with a rabbit or a ferret depending on your cuteness preference.  I ended up going with a rabbit and have since got a small bunny tattooed on my behind because I love him so much.  Hope it works out for you!|`|YpH6yMpsaa	I had a rat called Buffy with red eyes and i adored her so i would recommend one (but they have a short lifespan) <br>  Don't get a rabbit for in doors<br>  <br>  Also try two small birds like doves.<br>  I know from having them my self that doves are a piece of cake<br>  If you train them well and touch them you can get them to sit on your shoulders|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Either a rabbit of a ferret. I'm not sure if they respond to their name, but I think they're both trainable. Neither are dangerous if you treat them well, and it depends on their personality if they like human interaction or not. When you go to buy the pet, see if it responds much if you tickle it or something, but don't hurt it or go rough or stun it suddenly. A rabbit and ferret can sit at your desk, but they might wonder off, and might make nasty deposits on your desk, as with all animals, so take care with that.<br>  Hope that helps!|`|AA11593169	Some types of lizards can be trained to act more like  "normal" pets such as dogs and cats. For example, Iguanas can be walked on a leash, and though they are very mellow creatures most love attention. <br>  <br>  For a less interactive but very cool pet, I suggest a leopard gecko. They are very cool looking and pretty low maintenance. They grow to be about 6" long and live an average of 10 years. They can also be trained to use a "littler box" of sorts and even without any training they will only use area of their tank as a bathroom.<br>  <br>  Lizards may not be as interactive as you would like your pet to be, but they are very cool animals. Good luck with your new pet, whatever you choose!|`|xxTyjZCkaa	Do NOT get a chinchilla! They are horrible pets! They look cute but they are stupid and useless! <br>  <br>  Rabbits are okay but they're not at all as lovable as a rat or ferret. <br>  <br>  I would personally go with a rat or ferret. I had rats that came when I called. They were my babies. And ferrets are very trainable. They're like extremely smart cats. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  PS: some people are saying that they make big loads of poo but ferrets can be trained to use a box like a cat. They actually go in one place all the time. They don't like to poo where they live. You can have their scent glands removed and if you keep their cage clean the scent is very little. You can train them to stay with you and they sell little beds and hammocks you can hang around your desk. They even sell little leashes for the ferrets. Trust me, they're amazing.

Chinchillas I would not recommend. They are a little on the wild side and they have to bathe in volcano ash and can not be near water because it will make their fur fall out. Ferrets are ok, they usually stink so bad most people get rid of them after the first month. Rats are always really sweet ( a lot nicer than hamsters) but they will usually freak your guests out. You can also try out a Leopard Gecko, they are small and friendly and they love to sit with you after they are tamed. They usually only cost about $60 for really pretty ones, $30 for plain ones and although my mom thought they were gross at first, she went out and bought one and it sits in the pocket of her PJs and goes with her everywhere. But out of all the things you listed I would say you would probably be happier with either a rabbit or a rat. I would also recommend a guinea pig.|`|gFeOKLmoaa	Ferrets are great.  They are by far the most sociable small pet.  Easily liter trained, loves to play, and sleeps around 18 hours a day and will adjust their sleep schedule to whenever you can take them out and play.  Pet shops descent them nowadays, so a weekly bath will keep him/her smelling fine, and they even sell a water additive that will kill the smell of their waste.  If you want it to be verbally responsive, don't get an albino, as they are often deaf.  My little guy isn't even a true albino, but he cant hear.  Easy enough to figure out, just whistle or snap your fingers and look for a response.  They can be nippy, and some do have poor dispositions, but a firm hand in training can solve that.  My ferret is cautious about nipping even while playing! Anyways, there's plenty of info about them out there, or go to your local pet store and check them out.|`|ieTqqgbkaa	Honestly, none of those are good options. Their capacity isn't much. <br>  <br>  If you're wating a rodent, I would get a hamster. I used to have a plethora of them and always enjoyed it.

They're harder to clean up after.<br>  <br>  I don't know much about Chinchillas, so I can't give you any insight on those at all.<br>  <br>  Ferrets smell REALLY bad and can be bad tempered.<br>  <br>  If you get a rat, get a hairless one. They smell better. (Plus, they have character and they're kinda cute. :)<br>  <br>  I think a guinea pig would be a sensible option. (:<br>  <br>  If you're even considering a dog, I would go with a miniature Schnauzer. They're the best dogs in the world. I live on a farm, so I kinda know what a good dog is supposed to be.

Mine follows me into the bathroom and watches...too much info? <br>  If you think he's getting enough exercise and stimulation, then he could just be laid back. Good for you and him. :)<br>  Try little treats, maybe broken up pieces of Begging Strips in the Kong.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	You have a puppy who obeys you, doesnt chew on everything, and sits quietly when you are not working with him?<br>  <br>  Gee - what a problem :o)<br>  <br>  I would say you have a great dog.  Count your blessings.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	Hmm. I don't exactly see the problem. It sounds like he just really really likes you! lol Maybe he's just watching you and waiting for play time? If he's not doing anything destructive, then he's okay.|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	if he wants to sit there, let him sit. i guess he's interested.|`|3IQpCzEoaa	If you can, get another dog. He would love a friend that is there all the time with him! :D<br>  That's what I am doing for my puppy. I am getting another one this month!|`|0fJe9tTIaa	Puppies tend to require a lot of attention. It seems like you are devoting an adequate amount of time, but your puppy may want more attention. Getting another dog is an option, but if you can't do that, it's okay. I wouldn't worry about it, nothing is seriously wrong with your puppy. He probably just wants a little more attention. If all he's doing is staring at you then you should be fine. Keep doing what your doing and if you have more than 2-3 hours, you can always spend more time with him.
F27az9NEaa	Well have her spayed at 6 months of age, feed her properly and I suggest never getting a dog from that breeder again.<br>  Also, APBT are not classified by the color of their nose, they're all APBT (that annoys me to no end)<br>  Because she is a runt she may not grow to be as big as the other pups, but I would keep a look out on her health with regular veterinary care.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	without wanting to sound too negative, this puppy could have some serious (unseen) internal deformaties or health problems. You may have taken on a bucketful of problems. A responsible breeder would not have let this puppy go until it was a bit bigger and had been vet-checked.<br>  Feeling sorry for a puppy and taking one on is perhaps admiral but not the wisest decision for your future finances and possible heartbreak. <br>  <br>  If you have not already done so, get the puppy checked out by your vet and I hope I am wrong, for your sake.|`|vJg5k342aa	A puppy's size at that age rarely reflects size at maturity.  If you haven't brought the puppy for a well puppy exam yet, do so.  Your vet can further advise you on information regarding your dog's development.  Be conscientious about providing a high quality diet to the dog and she'll develop normally into the size her genes dictate.  Unless she was obtained from an experienced, responsible breeder, there's no way to know whether she'll reach the typical size of an APBT.|`|6DO1pNP6aa	she most likely will NEVER grow to be a normal size bit. BUT thats OK. personally I think pits look better small. ALSO she is a Girl, which means she WILL be smaller than the males anyways. <br>  <br>  I own a american staffordshire terrier that was a runt and shes really tiny, But thick. They look better that way. My other pit is tall but hes a male. <br>  <br>  <br>  just be grateful that shes alive, Most runts dont live that long. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I would LOVE to have a runt from a blue nose litter. Just because blue noses tend to be very large. she would probably end up being a perfect size.|`|RehgySLCaa	Less than 50, probably 30-35 pounds when adult
wLgGD63raa	If it is indeed a painted turtle, there are three ways to sex your turtle:<br>  <br>  First, males have much longer tails than females, and the male's tail also has a much wider base than the the female's. The female will have a much smaller tail when it comes to length and width. <br>  <br>  Another way is by looking at the cloacal opening (the anus). The cloacal opening on the male will be a lot lower on his tail. The female's cloacal opening will be right under her carapace (the back end of the shell), so it will be much closer to the base of her shell. <br>  <br>  The third way to sex your turtle is by looking at his or her front claws. The male's claws with be much longer than the female's claws. This means the female's claws will be shorter. The male's claws have longer claws because he will use them to "stroke" the female during mating. <br>  <br>  Here are pictures to help you sex your turtle, you will also be able to see the difference between the two, as they have a picture of a male a female together:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chelonia.org/sexing/sexing_Chrysemys_picta.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelonia.org/sexing/sexing_Ch...</a><br>  <br>  If it turns out that you do not have a painted turtle, here is a website to help you find your turtle and help you determine it's sex as well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chelonia.org/sexdetermination.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelonia.org/sexdetermination...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!
a2cjwMKcaa	What species of pleco do you have? Some only grow to 3", and are fine for a 20 gal tank. Bristlenose may reach 4-6", but thats still OK, and it would take them a couple of years to get that big.<br>  <br>  Other species are monsters. All the 'Common' plecs reach at least 12" eventually. So avoid those for a small tank.<br>  <br>  Personally I wouldn't put any pleco on a 10gal, unless you have a bigger home for it later. Even a 4" bristlenose is a big fish in a 10gal tank. It's the size (Weight, not length) of maybe 10 guppies or 20 neons, so it put a LOT of bio-load in the small tank.<br>  <br>  If your pleco is eating, then he's OK. They are often nocturnal and will spend the day sitting on or under a log. They are more active at night, but food will usually tempt them out during the day.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|3n60UxgQaa	Some people have told me plecos are slow growers (which I can't confirm since mine seems to grow at the speed of light).  However, the reason people advise against plecos in smaller tanks, is because they have the potential to grow to be 12" or more.  (Smaller ones grow to be 6".)<br>  <br>  A 10 gallon isn't enough and may result in stunting.  Your pleco will outgrow that 20 gallon as well, maybe not now but it will eventually (assuming you have a common pleco).<br>  <br>  A 10 gallon is fine for a while but it should not be a permanent home for the pleco.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Whoops. Forgot your other question. :p<br>  <br>  Your pleco seems to be fine.  They're nocturnal so they're usually most active at night.  When you turn off the lights, that's when he starts to get play. =]|`|Qhdozm54aa	A 10 gallon tank isn't exactly very big, while the fish could theoretically live in the tank on a short-term basis it would be better to keep it in a larger tank. Plecs are catfish which are primarily nocturnal, this means they will be most active after the aquarium lights go out.|`|MJW7Etk3aa	If you have the money for a zebra plec which only grow about 6 inches 10 gallons is enough room.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	one pleco could fit in a 10 gallon tank.  plecos are nocternal so its probably active at night
7sb7QqAEaa	The female and the male usually work together to warm the eggs up.<br>  If the male refuses to help incubate the eggs, the female will get mad and fight with him or try to chase him off. <br>  <br>  Take the male out during the day and put him in another cage. During the night, allow them to be together again but once morning comes take him out or they'll start to fight.|`|D75rqaihaa	it sounds like they are fighting...try an keep them seperate, untill the eggs have hatched...but make it so they can see each other<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x
01nMRPHVaa	A day or so.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	It may take a week or more. You can ease things through by feeding fattier food than usual: goldfish and liver are good for this. What you might try is injecting some of the food with food dye; blue is a good color to use. Once that food passes through, you know that the intestinal tract is clear of stones.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting rid of all gravel and stones. Not only can they be swallowed, they make the tank harder to keep clean.|`|ld2vmypNaa	‘Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for all land and aquatic turtles.<br>  <br>  IF she didn't spit it out it can cause internal damage and a vet is needed.<br>  Allot of times you just don't see them spit it out .If she is digging in the gravel she is probably hungry. Get gravel larger than they can swallow. Just keep a good eye on her.<br>  <br>  Contact rescues sites…and vets ..in your city ,state, or country<br>  For land or aquatic turtles:<br>   <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a><br>  <br>  What are you feeding her? They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle. ** When I got these two girls 37 yrs ago all we had to feed them back them were brown worms , tadpoles I caught  and goldfish. And my girls are still going strong and  just turned 37 yrs old this month.<br>  <br>  Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples cut up.. swollen eyes comes lack of vitamin A.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157614552292977/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck!

GSf09ALBaa	In over 25 years of dogs, I have dropped them at my vet in the AM and picked them up in the PM.  Never had to leave a spayed or neutered overnight.<br>  <br>  You will be fine and you obviously have your back covered with the emergency vet 5 minutes away.<br>  <br>  Good job.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	It is proven that dogs recuperate better at home.  If possible, it is always better to bring them home.  (unless of course there is a medical necessity for the vet to keep them and there is a medical attendant watching them)|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	it is very customary for a neutered dog to be picked up the same day,, it is not a complicated surgery...<br>  <br>  by all means  take him home the same day  ( you will be surprised at how well he feels when you pick him up)|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	As long as you have a place to keep him quiet and under observation, and away from stairs, there is no reason not to bring him home.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Wow, I have never been asked to leave ANY of my dogs overnight following a spay/neuter.<br>  <br>  He will be fine, bring him home!|`|xCK70761aa	I had my dog neutered and was in the same situation with taking off from work. Its fine to take him back the same night.Just buy one of those cone collars that you put around his neck so he won't lick the stitches or be tempted to jump off the couch or play excessively. And you have the Emergency pet hospital near you so god forbid something happens, its near you.|`|OrvTG44laa	Bringing the dog home will make them feel safer and more secure, which is important right after surgery.  But the dog will also be in a lot of pain by moving just slightly.  They like to just lie in one place, and not move.  <br>  My dog started screaming when we had to take her out of her carrying case.|`|P4JLGguJaa	take ur baby home the same day!! i got my lil one neutered and he was fine. he just wanted to lay under me all day!! your baby needs to be around a familiar person (which is you). he will feel more comfortable and be alot more calm.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	TELL them you will NOT leave it. <br>  TELL them you WILL pick it up at at blah blah pm. & it WILL be ready to go.<br>  YOUR dog...your decision!<br>  <br>  I never let vets bully me into bullcrap like that!<br>  They do NOT need monitoring OR ing pain meds!|`|11PAFD9Caa	I have 3 male dogs and they all came home with me the same day.<br>  I'm not saying this is your vet but many vets do this to get extra money. It is not necessary if you can keep him calm like you say you can and you don't have any other animals to "bother" the surgery site.<br>  So I say Yes, he can come home the same day.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	The reason that some vet clinics ask that you leave a neuter or spay overnight is because they can typically manage pain(with injections) better than you could at home. They cant legally hand you controlled substances that are commonly used-like morphine's, etc. Also to check if the pet was licking at it as well and sometimes they need a little clean-up at the site.<br>  As long as you keep him quiet and got the vets okay I don't see a problem. Males respond to a surgery like a neuter just fine and he should bounce back whether at your home or at the clinic :)|`|F27az9NEaa	I didn't need to leave my boys overnight when they were neutered, so that's a little odd to me.<br>  The only reason I can think they would want to keep him overnight is to be sure that he is stable, the anestitic wears off, and there were no complications (or they can't get to his surgery til later)<br>  I brought my dogs home immediately after their surgery, but needed to keep them confined to keep them calm-which is what you'll want to do.<br>  <br>  It's not that you don't want him too hyper (which, you DON't want him hyper,),he just needs to be on at least 7-14 days of rest. If you have a kennel/crate to keep him in, I would suggest doing that and only let him out (on lead) to use the restroom and to eat.<br>  It is imperative that the sutures have time to heal (and he not lick them). You don't want any infections, swelling or ect.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	There is nothing wrong with him coming home. It would free up some work on their end, and would be less stressful on the dog to be at home with you. My dog spend the night, and I missed her terribly. Some vets just keep them overnight to monitor and make sure they are fine. If he does stay, he will be mostly sleeping the entire time. If your concerned about vacation days mixed with guilt, it wouldn't be a crime if he was at the vet because of how drowsy he will be. I picked my dog up the next day and took that day off and all she did was sleep, I thought it would be comforting for her to have me around. Not to mention the amount of house work and tedious tasks I was able to complete with her being so tired. LOL. So it could work in your favour to be home (puppies are alot of work and its nice to have a mini break) Its smart that you know about the emergency vet in your area. Thats just smart ownership, nevermind being neutered. Good Luck!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I have never had to leave any dog at the vets overnight after a surgery.  I think that is just a precaution.  I don't see any reason to leave your dog overnight, unless the vet foresees some kind of problem.  I think maybe they do that for some kind of service to their customers.  I would go insane if my dog had to stay at the vets overnight.
3n60UxgQaa	Yes.  However, I would recommend that you put some plants or other hiding places in the tank.  Mollies are known to be fin nippers.  Some are, some aren't.  Depends on the individual fish.<br>  <br>  Mollies are freshwater, brackish, and salt water.  (Neat, huh?)<br>  So they don't NEED salt.  However, a little aquarium salt (1 teaspoon per every 10 gallons) will benefit both guppies and mollies and help keep prevent infections should one of your fish get injured and helps prevent ich and velvet among other benefits.|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	yes they will be good together but you will need to add some decor. including plants,and small houses,or any other hiding place.mollies are not really brackish fish.they can be in tank with salt but it is not necessary.they are like half brackish and half freshwater.you can keep them in a freshwater tank and they will survive.|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	They will work well together.  NOTE:  If you have any females, the two kinds of fish and inter breed.  So all of your guppies may be male, but if a female molly gets in there, a guppy can get her pregnant.|`|UqQ3PTN8aa	yea i believe so. thats a good mix there to.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	yes theyr a good mix|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Sounds like a fun tank setup with colorful livebearers.<br>  Guppies can handle a little salt and Mollies don't need a whole lot anyway.
x8Vgu6acaa	Stay away from the Rawhide bones.  They can clog him up.  <br>  Natural, raw bones.  Bully sticks.  Stay away from pressed chewies such as greenies.  <br>  I like the smoked bones, but they do leave crumbs on the floor when chewing.  The dogs will try to get them out of the carpet.  I am assuming a Mastiff could do quite a lot of damage to a carpet trying to get the crumbs up.  I usually let my dogs have the smoked ones on the linoleum or in their crates.<br>  some of they things I use, pig ears, ect might be too small for your dog.  You need something that is large and sturdy enough for him to chew and not break off large chunks.  I have heard of naturally shed deer antlers that are supposed to be really good, but I have not used them.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Yes, CET chews, they dissolve instead of possibly causing blockages in his throat or intestines, they don't stain, and they have an enzyme that cuts down on tartar build up on his teeth.<br>  I give them to my 6 dogs daily, much safer than rawhide or greenies - and a lot neater too.<br>  Rawhide is usually processed in some third world country and harbors bacteria.   One of my dogs got very sick on one and my vet told me that even U.S. rawhide is shipped overseas for processing and can cause bacterial infections.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can get them online, do a search.   Vets carry them too, but way more expensive there.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Smoked beef bones. The smoking process keeps it from messing up the carpet. Cow hooves & ears are great too.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	real bones<br>  <br>  stuffed Kongs|`|yLkSov8maa	Natural Bones. They are great for the teeth and dogs L-O-V-E them x 2948329468!

I feed natural bones to my dogs all the time and they like them way better than the store bought stuff.<br>  <br>  P.S- Rawhide's are made with anti-freeze! Don't feed them to your dog. Can get stuck in the intestines then you know what happens next....|`|5rfnEQnGaa	I would not be giving any rawhide chews (which usually come from China), pigs ears (which have caused blockages), any cooked/smoked bones (which often carry harmful bacteria, especially in hot weather), or nylon bones (can chew or scrape bits off and would not want my dog swallowing nylon) <br>  <br>   - give your dog a raw beef leg bone or knuckle bone, it's totally natural.|`|8fbbJUA7aa	Old socks.

Also, there are chews made for APBTs you can find on the internet.  Look for dog toys that are strong and hard.  Also, if you know anyone who hunts, deer and moose antlers are very healthy, don't splinter and are almost impossible to destroy.  They are also clean.<br>  <br>  Rawhides are not good.<br>  <br>  Add:  Dama, Mastiffs drool.
F27az9NEaa	You can check <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/</a><br>  it's an adoption based website where you can search for dogs needing homes in your area.<br>  <br>  There are many dogs that can live in an apartment, provided they have the proper physical and mental stimuli. If not they may become destructive, bark, or worse.<br>  <br>  Tell your mom to loosen up. Not all dogs are trained, and even if they are she may still have to invest some time in training a dog when it comes home. Dogs are not robots.<br>  Most rescues will do vaccinations for you, but don't let you mom get all hung up on a dog being potty trained. <br>  After all, she had to potty train you :D<br>  <br>  <br>  --<br>  When getting a dog, size is not the only thing to look at. You need to consider your activity level, grooming, if anyone has allergies, if there's a weight limit, your lifestyle, if your family is financially ready and has the time to commit to a dog-because they are lifelong responsibilities, not disposable toys.|`|yIBSIgoCaa	king charles spaniel, bishon frise, westie|`|fYkaxJYOaa	a Chihuahua they are not to big but also not to small!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

hbj6vGE4aa	Why wait to go to the media?  Do it now!<br>  <br>  How is this person "proving" that it was your dogs?  It should be a he said, she said issue, meaning that nothing can be proved.<br>  <br>  They are treating you like you are guilty before proven innocent.  Pay no fees, don't get the licensing.  Call a lawyer.  Seriously, don't give in!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	I agree with Aussies. Hire a lawyer and take it to the media.  Even if it costs you a couple hundred bucks, it will be worth it.  BTW, I recommend microchipping your dogs anyway.  It is very inexpensive and can help if your dogs ever do get out of the yard.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	I don't understand how they can be accused of a crime they didn't commit? Huskies are not dangerous dogs. LOL. Your dogs are properly fenced, and sounds like your following the law. I know in my city its actually a bylaw (most people don't know about) that your suppose to have a sign posted informing people that you own dogs. "Beware of Dogs" or something to that nature. Microchipping your dog benefits them, however my dogs also have "pet lynx" tags, which could help you if price is an issue. I would suggest speaking to your local animal control/SPCA. A lawyer may also be helpful. BTW passerbyers are harrassing the dogs! I've seen kids taunt dogs and then the dogs are punished for being scared and trying to defend themselves by barking/fanging. Huskies hate confinment and will fang. People at my SPCA press their face in front of the dog's window then claim it to be "too agressive" because he's fanging. I just want to slap them.
3IUMh4Igaa	You will have a blast! I go up there all the time. There and Oceola... You will find tons of pigs, canebreaks, cotton mouths, sometimes coppers, but not usually. I have found a few coral snakes, and was lucky enough to find a couple of gopher torts on one trip. Pretty much any road once you are in there is going to be good. Especially all the black top roads that you can cruise around the forest. But if you want the snakes, you need to go at sun up and sun set.
