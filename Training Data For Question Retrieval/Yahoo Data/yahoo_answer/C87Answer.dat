a8e1KcS2aa	Honestly, you could be found @ fault if you're driving in the improper lane, failing to yield, pulling out in front of people... just because you're barely speeding doesn't mean that there aren't other factors in the accident.  The person going 99 will get a ticket for speeding, reckless driving, aggressive driving if they made a lane change w/o signaling... You could both get tickets, and honestly, at that speed, the Fatal Accident Reconstruction Team will be called out and find the exact cause of the collision, thus citing the driver in the wrong.  Not many will survive a collision @ 99mph.  We don't go looking to fault people or make peoples' lives miserable, however, we do make judgment calls that are potentially life-changing in a very short period of time.  Police officers try to do their best.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	Under the circumstances you list, you should be in the clear and the speeder should get a reckless driving charge.  <br>  <br>  But let's add a detail to give us a reason to cite you too.  You seem to want to have an axe to grind and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.  So let's say you are on a multi-lane highway and change lanes and didn't see the speeder coming up behind you in the lane you change into.  He hits you.  All the witnesses agree that you changed lanes in front of the speeder.  You get cited for failing to yield the right of way or unsafe lane change.  I know it doesn't sound fair but it is your responsibility to make sure the lane you are moving into is clear to do so.  Now let's get you out of it.<br>  Since the other driver was driving at 99 mph, which equates to just under 150 feet per second, lets check the roadway to see if you'd have time to see the speeder coming.  If the roadway is straight as an arrow then you may not have an excuse.  You should have signalled for at least 100 feet and at 57 mph it would take you about 1.5 seconds to travel that distance.  So if you looked before you signalled, looked while signalling, we'll give you 3 to 4 seconds of having a chance to see the speeder coming.  At his rate of speed, he'd have been 450 to 600 feet behind you.  Did you have time to see him?  If not then you are absolved of responsibility.  If so, you're toast.  <br>  <br>  There are lots of factors to use in finding fault.  Pretty much you can tell who was at fault in simple accidents. An old timer once told me that accident reports are just for insurance companies to use to get out of paying.  I wouldn't be surprised.|`|y42LEQL3aa	Either person could be at fault, all depends on the circumstances. Most likely the guy going 99 will be found to be at fault.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Agreed.  I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and (as you mention) the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.  It is worth pointing out that the bulk of the extra costs of capital punishment are UP-FRONT, occurring before and during the trial (appeals are a relatively small portion of the extra cost).<br>  <br>  3. As you said, the deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	I wish we had it in the UK, then we would not see such an increase in crime.<br>  <br>  Sure in Americas racist past, a lot of innocent people were tried and murdered.  However now, with DNA profiling and conclusive evidence often proving without a shadow of a doubt that someone was the perpetrator of the crime - why should they not be killed?<br>  <br>  What good is a sentence?  They will not learn not to kill, they already did - and the family of the people they killed are not being served by taxpayers funding the cushy lives of murderers in prison.  <br>  <br>  I believe that the only way to get rid of society's ills is to remove them from society.  The punishment of potential death will also serve as a useful deterrent for anyone even thinking about it.  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  You simply cannot tell me that we have less knife crime since we stopped using physical and capital punishment!  We have more -  There were murders sure, but the numbers were nowhere near as high as they are nowadays that we like to pamper our murderers.|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	with the development of DNA....over 90 american death row inmates were found to be innocent of their crimes & released.  there should always be an appeal system no matter what cost.<br>  <br>  i do not agree with the death penalty...we should not return to the dark ages!!|`|shtP63traa	Life imprisonment without parole.<br>  <br>  * It prevents the criminal from causing additional harm, as they're permanently separated from society.<br>  <br>  * It frees up the time and resources that would've been used in appeal cases, and those resources can now be used to get additional criminals off the streets instead of spending years dealing with criminals already in prison.<br>  <br>  * For the religious people, it keeps them from violating (or condoning violation of) the "thou shalt not kill" commandment.<br>  <br>  * It prevents us from accidentally executing the wrong person (this is extremely rare, but important since it can't be reversed).|`|2OO9U8o9aa	It is no longer available in UK , even although it is highly likely if we had a referendum it would be hugely in favour . being part of the European Union prohibits any member state from having death penalty <br>  I think I am probably in favour for 1st degree murder , in particular child murder , but it will never be reintroduced here anyway|`|Z03zgM0maa	if you don't give them so many appeals, then it wouldn't cost anything. just kill them once you know for sure they did it. that would cost less money and make society safer. we don't need serial killers, people who cut off their wives heads, or child rapists to be living. they serve no purpose and should be put to death|`|ogLHkR0oaa	I agree with capital punishment, there isn't much chance of a mistake due to D.N.A.|`|bef202d85afc8aa7378d77f3bc4fd7e8aa	When someone, who has problems, is enraged and commits a terrible crime, the last thing on their minds is the death penalty.

I understand therapy does not work if the patient does not want it.|`|98JZcrO6aa	I am very much against the Death Penalty. How can you teach someone that murder is wrong by murdering them? Didn't the bible say Thou shalt not kill? ...<br>  <br>  Or does it say Thou shalt not kill unless that man or woman has killed?<br>  <br>  Can the police, the courts, and the system generally be trusted to get things right on every occasion? They never have been able to previously.<br>  <br>  We must also consider what the likelihood is of innocent people being executed - it is inevitable that it will happen sooner or later.<br>  <br>  Trust me, the only thing that is going through a murderer's mind at the point of killing someone is killing the person. He or she will not think about the consequences because murders are still up and large in the USA, PRChina, Iraq, Iran. <br>  <br>  We are all potentially capable of murder (a lot of domestic murders, where one partner murders the other during a row, are first time crimes) and, therefore, we must each consider whether we and our loved ones are more at risk of being murdered or being executed for committing murder.<br>  <br>  <br>  The main problem with Britain is that some Criminals are getting too easier sentences. Personally, i think that people who take drugs should not be imprisoned because they are not causing harm to anyone but themselves. If they are found possessing a drug, i say a massive hefty fine. A drug supplier however, should spend a VERY long time doing community service not to mention a continuous fine and confiscation of all his drugs. What Britain needs is for prisons to be a lot more fearful. <br>  <br>  Psychology could also work as well, repeatedly tell people that they will not get away with their crimes.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	There is no doubt about the guilt of Sutcliffe, Hindley, Brady, West, Huntley etc, what's there to appeal about?<br>  <br>  I think the punishment should fit the crime.

A person could learn from their mistakes if the punishment for their crime is more harsh; the word would even get out that a person had better not do so and so if they didn't want to get this harsh, torturous punishment.  See, I think that anyone who rapes a woman or child and can be convicted without a shadow of a doubt should have their dikkk placed in one of those jumbo rat traps with it already sat to catch a rat, and then the trap be made "Snap," about ten times in a row.   Wouldn't they get the point then as well as others who heard about it?  I mean, convicts are going to jail nowadays watching cable and working out!  And don't mention drive bys!  I think these punks that do drivebys should be placed in a cell and let a guard DRIVE BY their cell on a golf cart and shoot at places on the criminal that would just hurt him and not kill him.  I guess, I'm talking more of a "eye for an eye"-type punishment.  I would be willing to bet some money that this type of punishment would make crime go down in big cities!  Judges could even describe what punishment was going to be dished out in the court rooms to scare others from doing the same thing.  They could say something like, " Your sentence for murdering your wife will be the murder of 50 years of your future.  During this period, there will be no parole PERIOD."  See, that kind of sentence would get people to talking on the streets about what the hellll not to do in regards to the law.|`|QCj8303Haa	My girl friend was sexually abused by her grandfather, between the age of 4 and 7 now she has mental health problems.

6OLiuM9Gaa	Why "DID" they want people to join the navy? When?<br>  <br>  Usually it's because there are Navy-related jobs to be done and they need people to do them.<br>  <br>  Why can't they use the people they have? They do. But the people they have sometimes need to be augmented (as in time of war when ther are a lot more of those jobs that need to be done) or replaced (when they leave, retire, or die).<br>  <br>  Today, the Navy is actually becoming more restrictive. They -- and all the branches -- are being burdened with budget cuts being imposed by an administration that really doesn't know much about the military... except that they don't like it. So, despite a critical need for qualified, trained, senior personnel, many of those are opting to get out.

hdFMLVF7aa	For starters, its good that you are seeking help.  It will also look good when it comes to dealing with a judge.  Violating the probation is not good.    Punishment for that will be determined by both your judge and your probation officer.  Their are factors that will determine what kind of punishment you will receive if any.  Here are some of them:<br>  <br>  How long you have been on probation?  <br>  How much time do you have left on probation?  <br>  Are you up to date on your fees? <br>  Failed any drug/alcohol tests?   <br>  <br>  Beyond the probation, everything will be determined by whether or not this second DUI is considered a felony or a misdemeanor.  If its a misdemeanor, you probably aren't looking at much if any jailtime at all.  House arrest is most likely.  If its a felony, you might be looking at 6 months to a 1 year in prison.<br>  <br>  Stay in the treatment program and try to get yourself clean.<br>  Hope that helps.|`|y42LEQL3aa	Yes you will go to jail and you should. What if you had killed somebody or even yourself?

The length of time you will spend in jail really depends on what state you are in, and what court you go to.  Some judges are harder than others.<br>  <br>  Of course, jail will not be your only problem, your license will be suspended for quite a while for a 2nd DUI ... I wouldn't count on driving legally for at least the next 3 years.  There will also be significant fines to pay.<br>  <br>  Get a lawyer as soon as possible.  The lawyer will not be able to keep you out of jail, but they might be able to reduce the sentence.<br>  <br>  It's great that you are getting help for your drinking problem, even if you do go to jail please get back with the program after you get out.<br>  <br>  I hate DUI offenses, I've seen too many people in the ER because of crashes.

Treatment should always be an alternative to incarceration due to recidivism and cost of incarceration. however, my experience with those in therapeutic treatment oriented treatment units is there should be a combination of both treatment and lockup. This helps lawbreakers be ready to change and really think about their problems (instead of rushing them through treatment). <br>  <br>  Squeeze (legal consequences) helps treatment immensely- research indicates you don't have to want treatment for treatment to succeed. However, treatment should be much more than just showing up- providers need to be highly skilled. Prisoners who are just continually going through the motions need to do some serious time. Though faking it is a necessary stage, this stage needs to be worked through for success (for successful recovery, this stage needs to be confronted- prisoners can't just continue to fake it and get away with it).<br>  <br>  Research also indicated between 40-80% of substantiated child abuse/neglect cases have a substance abuse factor. I would guess child death cases would be enormously affected by substance use and abuse. We're rarely talking about 'occasional use' in this regard.|`|dUgL2DQnaa	i think there should be a rule like 3 times caught your out<br>  once you start its an addiction and its hard to stop<br>  they should send you to consuling or something or make you pay a fine|`|AA10274478	If their only crime is drug using, they should be sent to treatment instead.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	You are responsible for the money that's why. Making mistakes amounts to not doing your job correctly. Now I do not agree with holding people responsible when multiple people have had access to the drawer and this practice was never allowed when I was in fast food management. If we were sending someone on break either a manager had to run the drawer, or it had to be changed out so each cashier was directly responsible for their till. Money management in the modern age is atrocious.|`|bLIan6fuaa	When I was around 18 I was a cashier as well. I hated to share registers as I knew some of the cashiers were dishonest and stole money. I got written up a couple of times for being short from a shared register. <br>  <br>  After the second time I refused to work a cash register that was being shared. I figured they would fire me but they didnt. I received a job in another department that I loved lol|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	Yea, businesses that expect their cashiers to be able to count are so, so, oldschool.

Imagine if they had a loss of $60-$300 a day? that is a huge loss. Their job is to make sure that does not happen which is why you get disciplined because of it. Petty theft and shortages Can have huge affects to a retail store and even cause many of them to go out of business just from theft and shortages from registers. <br>  <br>  I agree sharing Registers is stupid and there is no reason you should have to do that. You need to discuss this with the manager and tell him that you would feel more comfortable being the only one responsible for your register.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	As a cashier, you are completely able to do your job without a single overage or shortage. All you have to do is pay attention. As for sharing, if that's the case, you can't really be held reliable. They write you up in case the pattern emerges, and they start to notice everytime you share a till, it comes up short, but doesn't happen to others who work there. It makes it easy to narrow down a thief really fast.

This is so because, as has been pointed out by scholars and politicians, early human experiments are likely to result in a number of clinical failures and lead to miscarriage, the necessity of dozens or even hundreds of abortions, or births of massively deformed offspring. Recent study of mammalian cloning also suggests that a number of defects often created in the reprogramming of the egg do not manifest themselves until later in the life of the resulting clone, so that mature clones have often undergone spectacular, unforeseen deaths."<br>  <br>  Obama does not hate science.  The possibility that cloning will be life-saving does not outweigh the potential problems with cloning.

I'm sure there are scientists who will pursue it out of public sight.  <br>  <br>  Actual human cloning presents an incredible opportunity for abuse.  Growing organs from your own body for replacement is not "human cloning."  Obama is referring to creating complete human beings, not organs for transplants.

As Canadians we have few choices of what we're eligible for, but you may want to have a look at the information for TN visas <a href="http://www.tnvisaexpert.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnvisaexpert.com/</a> A TN visa is a non-immigrant visa, usually valid for One Year (renewable). You must have the qualifications and a job offer from a US employer to be eligible for a TN visa. <br>  <br>  .also to remember, as Canadians we can visit the US for up to 6 months at a time, or per calendar year, whichever comes first. During that time, you are considered a Visitor, and not eligible to work. At all. Not even telecommute to a Canadian job over the internet. You cannot work in the US unless you have a work permit. Even for a foreign employer. <br>  <br>  5, If you're thinking of moving because you've fallen in love with an American, check out the information at Visa Journey <a href="http://visajourney.com/forums/index.php?act=home" rel="nofollow">http://visajourney.com/forums/index.php?...</a> This site has changed over the years, but its the one I used for information about my K3 visa, and has helped hundreds upon hundreds of other couples hurdle immigration. There is even a Canada specific forum. <br>  <br>  There are quite literally dozens upon dozens of websites out there dedicated to immigration to the US. These are just a few. Watch out for lawyers who say they can take your case and speed up the processing of your applications, or for any consulting office who charges you money for visa application packages. The forms are free at the USCIS website, there's no reason to pay for them from a consultant. And No Lawyer, no matter how good they are, can speed up the process, certainly not for marriage/family based immigration. It takes as long as it takes.|`|EbBpNaL4aa	apply for a visa, then after living here for like i think 5 years or more you go to a courthouse to get citizenship. call am embassy or something for details.|`|m45R3s5Daa	maybe i will move to canada. theres no jobs here. does canada offer illegals welfare like the US does?|`|CM3Fl3WRaa	First you need a green card. For that you must get married (there are there ways but you do not qualify). So first he needs to apply for a K visa so you can come and get married. If that is your plan look up K-1 visa or fiancee visa. <br>  If you come here on a "B" visa and try to stay you will be arrested and charged with visa fraud. You most likely will just be deported and banned from the US for life. You shouldn't make plans to go anywhere else as most countries will not give a person with a visa fraud charge against them a visa.<br>  So marriage and a "K" visa or you could have him move to Canada. I believe that can be a little easier in cases like yours.
k8ivyYfaaa	They can go so far as to be an entrance to war, like Clinton did with Kosovo, but there are no limits, per se.  Article 2 of the Constitution is pretty vague on the matter, but for example, Bush signed something like 400 in his 8 years in office.  <br>  They can only be 'revoked' if a subsequent president 'reverses' the order.|`|yIo9og80aa	how is this for Executive orders:<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.<br>  <br>  * EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency.

The National Guard could be federalized to seal all borders and take control of U.S. air space and all ports of entry. Many of the figures in the Iran-Contra scandal were part of this emergency contingent, including Marine Colonel Oliver North.

Much of it in concept can be traced to Greek and Roman ways. Add to that the Judeo-Christian traditions (even if you are not  practicing Jew or Christan) value systems and moralities, that area was ripe for a democratic or on representative form of government. Especially when you take into consideration the notion of individual liberty and personal independence of people from that region. Oriental (in the most broad sense) ways of thinking are more group focused, and African traditions are similar in the concepts of village life, etc. Europe seems to be an area full of deep thinkers, and has produced most of the best AND worst ideas known to mankind.

lwccQoEZaa	this is a non issue as science itself has moved past embryonic stem cells|`|FUL3Ez2Iaa	I support stem cell research whole heartily.  The private sector has done some wonderful things with adult, umbilical and placental stem cells.  In fact, just yesterday it was announced that the private sector has developed an adult skin stem cell that has the same capabilities as that of an embryo.  I am against killing embryos for stem cells as there is NO NEED.  I also am against Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research as there is NO NEED, the private sector is doing a great job and we have no money for the Government to provide the funding.|`|kCDzXCCKaa	I believe that stem cell research should be allowed because it can help the living. I'm usually not concerned with what could have or would have been. I'm more concerned with the living people that are suffering. <br>  People can worship and believe however they wish but their view points shouldn't stifle the progress of science and medicine. I think the real question is...who is benefitting from stem cell research being illegal? Who is suffering from it?|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	no one even knows if there is a god or not, but we know there is plenty of disease and we know a stem cell is not a human being, the answer should be obvious to any rational person.|`|wsTK80H6aa	I'm not concerned with playing god because I'm not a believer in a god.|`|HI73YeWWaa	I am not opposed to adult stem cell research.|`|FKN9kBvLaa	I understand your indecisiveness on the subject, because I've had my inner struggles over it as well.  However, although I believe in God and have a strong faith, I cannot deny the possible benefit of saving the lives of people with painful, deadly diseases of which they're are currently no cures (ie. Parkinson's)).  I think the PRACTICAL benefits supersede the religious doubt.  I know you've asked us to dissociate ourselves from the emotion, but when we're discussing a possible cure to MULTIPLE life-threatening diseases, that's virtually impossible unless you're a robot.  This is all to say, I'm for it, because I don't believe God would grant science and man the intelligence and ability to do it, unless He wanted it done.|`|l5cxmTb9aa	I'm not against stem cell research but then again I'm okay with developing three-armed two-headed six-legged humans so I'm probably not the one to ask. This is part of the liberal side of my philosophy. <br>  <br>  This does play into one of the greatest problems we have now though. Science has produced such advanced technology for curing diseases and prolonging life that the cost of health care is skyrocketing. How do we pick who gets to have joint implants. Will the government or our insurance be expected to pay for artificial organs or for organs grown from our own stem cells?<br>  I think we're just touching the tip of the iceberg of what's possible in this area of research.|`|kprKXEOSaa	You know, I just had a thought.  (It happens...)  Why are we even doing stem cell research, if we're eventually going to have universal health care?  I mean, Obama has already started stashing money away in a "lock box" for universal health care, so we all know it's coming, right?<br>  Who was it, it was someone on the left that basically said that Americans are going to have to accept a lower standard for health care, and we are going to have to accept that we can't cure every ill.  You're old, you don't qualify for treatment.  You're going blind in one eye?  Well, you've still got one good eye, what are you complaining about?  You need a heart transplant?  Well, since your BMI is too high, you don't qualify for a heart transplant.  And on and on.  <br>  So my point is, why are we even having this debate?  Once we go to universal health care, none of us shlubs are going to qualify for any of these new, cutting edge treatments anyway.  <br>  Maybe we can sell the technology to, oh, I don't know, Saudi Arabia?  What country doesn't have universal health care (meaning, they're not bankrupt) that could buy it from us?|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	well to answer truthfully i can not dissociate myself<br>  i am a republican and normally would be against it<br>  but i suffer from something that has no cure but it does have hope when it comes to stem cell research <br>  so i am sorry to say that the selfish part of me wants it to be done because of my sister and i ,it can cure us both<br>  but again it is me being selfish|`|QlrIUIfOaa	I support stem cell research.

HpJ4wwC7aa	Probably a corporate lawyer, patent lawyer, large real estate contract lawyer, or any type of intellectual property lawyer. Those areas are generally pretty well paid, except patent lawyers need to have an undergraduate degree in a science to even sit for the patent bar. So if you think you want to go that route, make sure you have a degree in biology, chemistry, physics, etc. It's highly specialized because you have to understand lots of technical scientific language, and they're always in high demand with high starting salaries, every time I check out the current listings for law positions. It kind of annoys me that I didn't know that before I majored in what I majored in. I wish I could go back and get a degree in biology so I could get one of those high paying positions when I graduate law school.|`|AA11934014	Solictors working for a large firm who have major commercial clients will earn an average in excess of ￡1m per annum at partner level. <br>  <br>  QC's in commeecial practice could expect fee income at or above this.  <br>  <br>  This is very atypical of most legal incomes, I can assure you of that.|`|AA11974929	Tax attorneys and corporate attys are typically paid the most - because they are sued the most and therefore pay the highest professional insurance fees.

Low-end lawyers in any other area might as well be playing the blues on a street corner; low-end corporate lawyers make a pretty comfortable living.  In the mid-range, every lawyer makes a comfortable living, but the corporate mid-range folks are a little more comfy than most.<br>  <br>  As far as the high-end goes...Sure, Personal Injury lawyers get the occasional big payout.  High-end criminal lawyers are the folks most lay people think rake it in.  Yet specialists in Mergers & Acquisitions make money the quantum of which is beyond the ken of mere mortals.|`|nr6RYBzBaa	Generally the lawyers at large private firms in major cities will have the highest salaries.

Also it would have increased American influence in South East Asia and opened new trade markets there for the USA, so there's 3 reasons<br>  Stopping communism in SEA<br>  More influence in SEA<br>  More markets in SEA<br>  <br>  Remember, though, this was just after WW2 and the yanks had spent 3 years fighting partly to help liberate France, they had bases in Europe, and no way could they have backed the Viet Minh militarily against a European ally. Not possible.

From a purely humanitarian perspective, had America sided with the communist revolution, a relatively peaceful transition would have occurred and the senseless death of millions would have been avoided. From a purely cynical political perspective, the Viet Minh were initially quite keen on friendly relations with America and the revolution ultimately may have otherwise been a staunch ally in the region.

It was a sellout to their geopolitics.<br>  <br>  Having fought a costly war in Korea in which they failed to achieve decisive victory, they thought the N  Viets were a push-over.

It is a very small community and as a result advancement is slow and the chance of one of those positions being available at meps is rare.<br>  <br>  The Navy is about deployments and there is a chance you would be assigned to a Large ship like an Aircraft Carrier or be stationed overseas. <br>  <br>  So for your recruiter to say you would never leave the country on deployment is a bold faced lie. Second getting a media position is a rarity but does happen.  <br>  <br>  Starting at 30k a year ?

gm9QYLjIaa	I'm just going to repeat myself but I just have to sorry. This was my answer to a previous question of yours, maybe you didn't read it since your question got deleted.<br>  "You know I wouldn't feed you, but you sound like an ignorant little kid, and I really want to educate you for the sake of a better world. <br>  First of all, I first invite you to Turkey to witness what's going on here with the Kurds before weeping in front of your computer on your comfortable *** in Germany/USA/UK or whatever. I have had a Kurdish boyfriend and several good friends who are, hey, guess what? Pretty happy living in Turkey. <br>  I'll speak in your language: LEARN TO SEPARATE THE PKK FROM KURDS. The PKK today is constituted mainly from Iraqi Kurds willing to extend their territory. Kurds in Turkey today share a number of problems with the Turks in their areas, economic and political alike. The water supply cuts have affected everyone living in that area and was aimed at lovering the support giving to the PKK (where do you think they get water from). A major issue that they don't share is the fact that there is no Kurdish education, but it's the constitution that bans the Turkish government from creating any schools in another language than Turkish, that's what private institutions are for. So if a billionaire is willing to create a private Kurdish school, there's basically nothing stopping him. Kurds were never killed by the Turkish government (although recently some accidents of abuse by the military present in the area have been reported, the culprits were tried and arrested), but it is true that there have been cultural persecutions, notably the use of the Kurdish language in broadcasting. Today not only that ban has been lifted but there is both a national Kurdish channel (TRT Ses) and a daily Kurdish newspaper (Azadiya Velat, I think it's called). When the PKK attacks were at its peek (80-90), Kurdish artists were also persecuted, booed off of stage and went into exile (Yilmaz Guney and Ahmet Kaya, notably, great extraordinary men that had nothing to do with the PKK, Yilmaz fled to France because he was a communist not a Kurd). But in the last three years I've attended three concerts of Kurdish singers (Rojin, Metin-Kemal Karaman, Aynur), several concerts were Turkish singers sang in Kurdish (Grup Yorum, Kardes Turkuler, etc.) and other organizations by the municipality (1st of May last year, there was only a Kurdish singer and both Turks and Kurds alike, danced together without any trouble). Seriously, grow up. We all know we're brothers, and no matter how corny that sounds this is true as long as we respect each other. <br>  Now lets have a trip over to Wikipedia, it's quite a reliable source for most basic informations. Oh and what do we see! The United states, several human rights organizations, Nato and the European Union all classify the PKK as a terrorist organization? Wow, so much for countries supporting the PKK. The PKK seems like it had a good base (having a marxist name and all) but it never did. 10 years after it was founded it planned to assassinate a Kurdish leader because he collaborated with the Turkish government (Lets not forget that today they're sending life threatening messages to Rojin because she has a program on the Kurdish channel). The party was already founded during a very bad time in Turkish history, left wing and right wing partisans were going against each other, killing each other and later being punished by the military junta of 1980. The PKK was not left out, and like the other Turkish citizens, endured the same difficulties. Those who fled to the Middle East at that time, transformed the organization into a pseudo-military one, aided by Syria and accumuled attacks against civilians and government officials. Now what have we learned? The PKK has never been "good". If it had been don't worry, I would be the first one supporting their origins. <br>  If you want more, let me tell you the real story of the situation in the South-East. The PKK is not the saviour of the Kurdish people, unfortunately the Kurds are not that different from the Turks and have a hard time standing up for themselves and asking for their rights. If they had done that a long time ago, maybe today we would have had public schools where Kurdish was taught as a local language, or an autonomous region called Kurdistan. But no, they had to start a bloody war, that would lead to the death of innocent people. Do you know why so many Kurds flee to Istanbul and Ankara? It's not only from economic reasons I assure you, it's because PKK militants come into their houses, use it as shelters, consume the bits of food they have and leave them with empty promises of a better future. These families are then left empty handed and could have liability of having collaborated with terrorists, which is an international crime. This is why they run off from the villages in those areas and settle in Istanbul, fully knowing that they would live even more mis|`|NktvqJhlaa	Well partner it looks like you're pretty upset about this and no one is responding so I guess I'll ask you some questions. What exactly is the goal? Do you think Turkey is going to give the pkk a piece of their country? I don't know a lot about the situation but I do know that the Kurds have been helpful to the US forces in Iraq. As a veteran myself I do appreciate that. Why is it not possible for the pkk to live peaceably as part of the Kurdish community in NW Iraq? Are they still set on having a state or territory of their own? I'll come back and check with you. You're going to have to provide more detail.

Why?  Well--first, this is an absolutely serious answer (but I suggest you read some of the books listed below to see for your self, especially the first).<br>  <br>  The religious right (which is virtually identical with the blue collar conservative) hs it's modern origin in the "welfare capitalism" and company towns c.1880-1930. Among other things, unethical business owners built churches for the workers--and paid the salaries of preachers IF they taught a doctrine of submission to employers and an anti-labor "religious" message.<br>  <br>  In the 1930s/40s, millions of these workers migrated out of the South, where they were mainly located, to the west and Midwest. Where? Look at a map of Red/Blue states--there's still a near perfect correspondence. As migrants, they banded together, reinforcing the separatist culture forced on them in mill villages and the like.<br>  <br>  Today, their descendants are the 5-6th generation to be indoctrinated with the admittedly absurd ideology you spoke of--as a religous doctrine taught from birth.<br>  <br>  BTW--little has changed. One of the misunderstood of the religious right is WalMart (to mention only one guilty party). Believe me, contributions from low-wage workers in those "fundamentalist" churches don't buy million dollar mansions or private jets, like all the leading "evangelists" have.

I think the far greater issue is with the delusional blue-collar workers who elect wealthy politicians to office because they think they are going to rob from themselves to give to the blue-collar workers.  If these wealthy politicians were so generous then why did they need to be elected to a political office to redistribute their wealth, why didn't they just do it?|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	The way you're stating it sounds a bit extreme, but I figure you're probably angry because you used to believe in a work ethic, and then figured out the big lie and are smarting from the painful disillusionment ...

U95m4LhAaa	That case was in court (different courts and levels) 6 times.  Assuming you mean the most recent case:<br>  <br>  Edwin Edwards, et al v Don Aguillard et al, 482 U.S. 578, 107 S.Ct. 2573 (1987)<br>  <br>  was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1987 regarding creationism. The Court ruled that a Louisiana law requiring that creation science be taught in public schools along with evolution was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, however, it held that "teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction."<br>  <br>  In support of Aguillard, 72 Nobel prize-winning scientists, 17 state academies of science, and 7 other scientific organizations filed amicus briefs which described creation science as being composed of religious tenets.

wVik8Fo7aa	The opposition to this potential life-saving treatment is due to the religious right's belief that destroying cells that are frozen in perpetuity is the equivalent of destroying human life.  They often use the bogus argument that other forms of stem cell research are superior, but acclaimed scientists in this field adamantly disagree.  The researchers understand that they must be free to study and test various types of cells in order garner the correct path.  The cells in question are leftover invitro-fertilization clinic medical waste that would be discarded and never be implanted in a woman.<br>  <br>  Number of "snowflake" babies last year in the U.S.=70<br>  Number of leftover cells to be discarded=600,000+   <br>  <br>  We hope that the US is able to catch up with other countries, who have moved forward in this specialty and have acquired some of the top researchers from our country, who have been denied federal funding during 8 years of the Bush administration, who placed ideology over scientific fact.|`|AA10079277	There is some opposition to the research, but the bigger opposition is about who will pay for it.

This is common sense.|`|ovSkTNCoaa	President Obama makes it sound as if nothing scientifically has taken place for the last 8 years. There was stem cell research going on in the past 8 years, there was even embryonic stem cell research taking place. The government just didn't fund it.|`|AA10138269	Unfortunately, its not gonna stop because their are some in Washington and Hollywood pushing for it with lots of rhetoric and cash.|`|AA10287176	You are making a logical fallacy. Slippery slope arguments are usually fallacious. In the case you present, you don't give any reason to assume that stem cell research will lead to science which can do anything. Where does advocating stem cell research stop? Well, at advocating stem cell research. Many other countries have done it without falling down the slippery slope. Furthermore, embryos have been created and destroyed in fertility treatments for many years now. My guess is you do not see the use and destruction of embryos for fertility treatments as the start of a slippery slope, so why do you assume that using and destroying them to cure diseases will lead to forced human experimentation?<br>  <br>  I have no idea what "precedent" you imagine this sets. Allowing stem cell research? That was already done, Obama's decision just expands the funding from the federal government. Destroying embryos? Again, that is been allowed for years (see above), and abortion as well. <br>  <br>  You also assume, for no apparent reason, that the stem cell decision is "going to take moral guidelines out of science." If that is what you believe, you are simply wrong, as moral guidelines still exist in science. <br>  <br>  Try reading more on the issue, and raising the question with professional ethicists. A number of philosophers have written on the ethics of this issue, and you might find their works enlightening. That is not to say they all will support stem cell research, but even reading those who oppose stem cell research may benefit you by helping you to make a better argument, even if nobody changes your mind.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	Please name some terrible things have been done in the name of science.  I'm not aware of any.<br>  <br>  No human being has ever had or ever will have an abortion for the purpose of providing stem cells.<br>  <br>  Edit: The "terrible things" that you alude to were almost always done in accordance with existing ethical rules.<br>  <br>  Obama nor anyone else is saying that scientists should be able to do whatever they want as long as it furthers science.  The law has no exclusion for science.  All things that are crimes will continue to be crimes even if they are done in the name of science.  <br>  <br>  In Tuskegee, they had a set of ethical rules and they followed them.  Ethical rules do not necesarilly lead to moral results.

I don't care. As a matter of fact I actually hope you die. That goes for anyone dumb enough to believe that stem cell research will lead to experiments on humans.

ZzXxRLWcaa	Absolutely! Anything is better then this current system where PROFIT determines your health care.<br>  <br>  The old anti-universal health care line is: "Do you really want government health bueracrats deciding your health plan instead of your doctor?"<br>  <br>  Well right now we dont have health bueracrats deciding things... nor do we have doctors, nurses or patients deciding things. We have greedy insurance company agents who make BONUSES for denying claims deciding things.<br>  <br>  Gee thats much better. *sarcasm*<br>  <br>  Last I checked the post office gets a letter from california to new york for 43 cents in about 2-3 days. If our health system was half that efficient I'd be satisfied. So give me the government bueracrats any day of the week.<br>  <br>  Oh.. and the whole "but things are so terrible in univeral health care countries". Thats BS. The british, french, swedes, and whoever else LOVE their damn health care systems. And the proof is in the pudding...<br>  They live longer then us, have lower infant mortality rates and overall better health numbers for their population.<br>  <br>  Part of that is preventative care... which they wholeheartedly do for free. Which by the way is often denied here.<br>  <br>  And to respond to the to the insurance broker...<br>  I've worked in the P&C, personal injury and health insurance lines for thirteen years at three large companies in Connecticut.<br>  <br>  Yeah, some jobs might be in jeopardy. But so the F what? So your job is more important then the betterment of our entire society?<br>  People who used to make asbestos are out of work too. Sometimes you gotta move on. And seriously... if you work in the industry you should know how freakin dirty it is. I got back into P&C because it makes me feel slightly less dirty...<br>  <br>  EDIT: and the whole "canadians coming to the US because they need better care?" is BS too. Actually its US citizens going to canada for their drugs and treatments which is the real clue to what's happening. Get the facts people, stop with the propaganda.|`|rxQt7auLaa	Not me.<br>  <br>  If national health care was a viable solution, there would be no "Health tourism" industry in Canada, and there would not be a thriving private health care industry in the UK.<br>  <br>  The US health care system does a very good job of taking care of about 85% of the population.  There is no justification to replace it because of the other 15%.  Instead, repair the non-performing portions.<br>  <br>  And, for those that complain about how expensive health insurance is, I recommend that you take a look at your spending before opening your mouth.  Complaining about health care costs while waiting on line in Starbucks really kills your argument.  If you can afford $4 coffee drinks, bottled water, cell phone service, and cable TV, you can afford health insurance.  If those other things are more important to you then your health, that's your problem, not the Government's.|`|b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	Not me.

What we really ought to do is throw the insurance industry out and have a single-payer plan.  In fact that's what most Americans say they want in poll after poll.  But in the last debate between McCain and Obama, McCain -accused- Obama of favoring a single-payer plan and Obama was quick to deny it.<br>  <br>  What we could do, and Obama has hinted at this, is figure out how much Medicare costs on a per-person basis and allow people to join that instead of their commercial insurance.  That would be a lot cheaper, and Medicare offers about the same level of care and about the same customer satisfaction.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	That is not what Obama is proposing.

I saw a clip of him, mouth-frothing more than usual, bemoaning the fact that women didn't like him. Well, he was married 3 times and then divorced 3 times. So he recently took a trip to the Dominican Republic (notorious for child sex-slaves) and upon re-entry to the U.S. when his suitcase was opened at Security, it was full (not filled, but pills-aplenty) of Viagra. When asked about it, he gave that infamous belly-chuckle growl and snickered, "I wish I could tell ya, har har." <br>  <br>  That certainly leaves a lot of room for speculation, but I'll let someone else figure it out. However, maybe the fact that he even NEEDS Viagra says something about why women don't like him... maybe it's not that just his handshake is limp...<br>  <br>  Anyway, he lost it, on-air, about asking about why women don't like him, He tells them to call, then says he doesn't want femi-nazis, etc, etc and looks like he's about to explode even more than usual.<br>  <br>  Want him in their corner?

All three had one-party systems, while other political parties were simply outlawed.

Private enterprise was illegal, and private firms were "nationalized" or otherwise seized by the government. The other two countries (the fascists) leaned the opposite direction, toward corporate statism. That means they allowed private ownership and investment, as long as the dictator did not find the owner/investor objectionable.<br>  <br>  When you separate "form of government" from "economy" the distinctions become clear.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	all words that have no absolute meaning, <br>  <br>  for instance: fascism is national socialism.

In responding to anarchists, Mensheviks and other critics who were using Stalin's Moscow Trials as a pretense to attack Bolshevism, Trotsky presents the theoretical heritage which only the Fourth International was able to defend: “an analysis of the imperialist epoch as an epoch of wars and revolutions; of bourgeois democracy in the era of decaying capitalism; of the correlation between the general strike and the insurrection; of the role of party, soviets and trade unions in the period of proletarian revolution; in its theory of the soviet state, of the economy of transition, of fascism and Bonapartism in the epoch of imperialist decline, and finally in its analysis of the degeneration of the Bolshevik party itself and of the soviet state.”<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct2008/stal-o20.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct200...</a><br>  The article explaining is by the socialist hero Leon Trotsky who was killed by Stalinist agents for opposing his crimes.<br>  Trotsky explained Stalin's actions:<br>  'It is time, my listeners, it is high time, to recognise, finally, that a new aristocracy has been formed in the Soviet Union. The October Revolution proceeded under the banner of equality. The bureaucracy is the embodiment of monstrous inequality. The revolution destroyed the nobility. The bureaucracy creates a new gentry. The revolution destroyed titles and decorations. The new aristocracy produces marshals and generals. The new aristocracy absorbs an enormous part of the national income. Its position before the people is deceitful and false. Its leaders are forced to hide the reality, to deceive the masses, to cloak themselves, calling black white. The whole policy of the new aristocracy is a frame-up.'|`|jWO10NN5aa	No, it was more socialist than communist.

In my mind our rights are being taken away every chance they get.  Obama seems to have brain washed much of the American people into thinking he is the next coming of Christ.  He is pushing his dangerous ideals and many americans are falling for it.  However, there are more and more people waking up to the corruption of the government.  There is even talk of Revolution, and in my mind this has been long due.  If there are any British people that would like to discuss this with me i would be honored.

However if he were to get a care package he would have to open in in front of his entire platoon and his drill sergeants and they would confiscate most of anything you send him. Of course they would ask him if he would like it returned to him after basic training. <br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  US Army<br>  retired|`|kHqCFCJ3aa	Keep in mind that in basic training they don't allow you to have any "goodies" at least in the beginning... care packages are fine as long as you do send stuff like soap and deodorant... he will have to open it in  front of the drill instructor and if there is "contraband" they will take it.    they did when i was in anyway.. hang in there it gets better and he will be able to get packages.|`|TGkGfeDCaa	HAHAHAHAHAHA brings back good memories...

jKiVzmnCaa	That's rough, and its an odd selling point of the military.  That they'll pay for college while you're in.  Sure, they will...but never forget that you're on the Navy's time.  You have to completely work around the Navy, and not your school.  Also, you might find yourself in areas that don't have internet access.  You also need to make sure that whichever online courses you take -- that their credits will actually transfer.  You definitely want an accredited college/university.  <br>  <br>  If you get someone in charge of you that doesn't like you for whatever reason...they can make any hopes of taking classes impossible.  Or, choose to aid in you failing (in which case, you usually have to pay the government back for failing the class).  While I was in the Army for 4 years - I only know of 1 person that took online courses with any success while in Iraq...and it was hard.  All military duties come first, and then personal.<br>  <br>  However, if you get an awesome leader, and will allow you to do your classes, and not load you up with official work...then it might work out.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, I'd suggest you do something like ROTC (that is, if you want to be in the military).  Or, join the Navy, take a few classes that you can depending on your Navy work load, and if you haven't reached your goal by 2012 -- when you get out of the Navy use the GI Bill to finish it off as a civilian.<br>  <br>  Overall, school and the military are not a great combination.  Unlike having a job in the civilian world you can say "school comes first" -- in the military...the mission comes first.  You are property of the U.S. Government.|`|VP1yQRwNaa	If I can do it while at that long a go time being an active alcoholic, you should have no problem.

LenfoJSRaa	For what it is worth I would agree, Marines over the Army all the way. Because they are specialized in land and water. <br>  The answer lies in you though if you just want to do it easy go to the Army but if you want to be a bad a-s-s be a Marine.|`|0XdkbEtFaa	i think neither|`|rpU209Xfaa	i'm not gonna be like," hey army rocks!" or "woo! marines are the sh**!" i am going to give you the full out details..<br>  if you want help with college and stuff along that nature, then go army.they help you with tuition even in this bad economy.<br>  but if you want a totally big mental and physical challenge, then go marines.<br>  if you want help with living and food expenses, aka complete help, then go army.<br>  the one thing is with the marines is that when they say you got a job, you don't always get that job. when you sign up for one in the army, you are guaranteed it.<br>  in either one, you are practically guaranteed to go overseas, that is just because of where we are at right now.<br>  but if i had to pick just one of these two, i would say army...they are better to you|`|IaK4SRHpaa	If you're serious about joining the military, it should be your decision which to join and no one elses.  What I would suggest you do is to talk with people from both units and decide for yourself.  Stop asking civilian people like us which one they think you should join. Listen to the recruiters instead and be up front with them that you are looking into both and want to decide which is best for you and what you want to do.<br>  <br>  And don't go by that they are saying that the word ARMY stands for, that's just dumb. Good luck to you and whatever decision you decide to do.  I included links to both outfits so you can look into what they have to offer you.|`|Jklpfaecaa	choose wat ever u want don't let anyone tell u one is better than the other cause there lying....i personally didn't want to do marines because "they are first to go and the last to leave." i joined the army and got a 11x with Option 40 ( Airborne Ranger) so im happy ... i ship out in 12 days so im excited !!!|`|4kuWOZowaa	You have to be really hard to go into the marines...they break you down!|`|Im8G3mjRaa	Well, the Marines is the fastest growing branch in the military right now. Soon they'll have to change it from "The Few. The Proud." to "The Many. The Humble." I know a few Marines and they're not what everybody expects them to be, I can tell you that. In fact, they hate it and want out and even considering a dishonorable discharge and all of them but one is actually in combat arms. But it's whatever you choose. Good luck. I wouldn't base your decision on the uniforms or some Jarhead slogans.|`|AA11185595	With that attitude in mind , the marine corp will tell you ...........................................

The Few and the Proud.<br>  <br>  if you like military facts heres one:  the Navy has more planes than the Air Force.|`|tehdmkjkaa	I am in the army and i love it. It really does not matter which one you join. They each have jobs that will either put you in the frey or take you out of it. they each have great financial opportunities along with college aid. i would say army because it was the first and it will always be the best. <br>  the airforce live better than both though.<br>  Right now the army has 12 month deployments and the navy and airforce have 4-6 month deployments. Depending on what your job is of course. Talk to your local recruiters. <br>  oh and most marines come to the army side.|`|sB5vlQULaa	Hey, I respect people who have the guts to join up. But you really got to think about this. Seriously.<br>  <br>  When I first joined at age 18, I thought it was the most honorable job in the world. I mean, who got more respect than a good soldier?<br>  <br>  That idea changed very quickly. Don't listen to all the talk about no army brutality. Its HOGWASH. I got sworn in and accepted 39 lashes with a military belt(they said 40 would be cruel). The officers are fair, but they leave you overnight with sargeants. <br>  <br>  One corporal decided to have some fun and not let me sleep. He kept getting up every couple of minutes to kick my bunk. After about half an hour, I got up and let him have it! I gave him a fat lip, but patrols ran in an held me down so he could give me a black eye. Then they arrested me for attacking a soldier with a superior rank!!! Luckily, this is Ukraine, so I got of the bat since my uncle works in SBU(modern KGB). The corporal was even dishonored by being forced to leave the military. But this is Ukraine, and they can do that.<br>  <br>  Later, as I was finishing my first year, the guys wanted to go for a beer. That is strictly forbidden on the base, but since on was on patrol duty, they decided they could do it anyway. When I told them that I'd report it, they let me have it. It ended with me getting a black eye, fat lip, and a couple of cracked ribs, and a minor concusion.<br>  <br>  I tried to contact my uncle, but he told me to grow up. So, they let it go.<br>  <br>  Thats when I decided to do ROTC. I became an officer, but that doesn't mean that you'll be treated better.<br>  <br>  And if you still decide to join, then you gotta do Airborne! They need tough guys like you!<br>  <br>  btw, red beretts,  are always the first at the battle! That means AIRBORNE|`|9EKecl3Daa	Ask yourself this question. How many of these people have been in the Marines or Army. It depends what unit you go into. For example my husband was Special Forces, and was always the first in. the marine is a different breed of military. What do you want from your service? I would do some very thorough research before you decide. Do what is right for you, not what other people say is right. Good Luck!|`|RvOr6JlAaa	I dont think you should.Joining the army or anything like that is kinda stupid.Im not calling you stupid,but You might die and Whats the point if obama is slowly taking us out?Im just saying,Most people go to the army,and A lot of people die.Its not what they describe it as,My brother went and he said it was terrible.Intense heat Ontop of HEAVY clothing,parched a lot,Alquaida attacks,and your told what to do.Its not an army of one.Its an army of Run like your butt is on fire and do what your told or die.|`|s8n1pcd2aa	Let me just say this and trust me i've seen it many many many times,  Marines tell us army guys "Once a marine,always marine" well how come they just finish their first contract and never re-enlist?

See we are being brought into a new system of control, one that normally we would not except under any exceptions BUT they know if the system that exists now is completely destroyed the general population will BEG for this new GLOBAL system they have been setting up for a long time now.<br>  <br>  “TODAY AMERICANS WOULD BE OUTRAGED IF U.N. TROOPS ENTERED LOS ANGELES TO RESTORE ORDER; TOMORROW THEY WILL BE GRATEFULl! This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WILL BE WILLINGLY RELINQUISHED for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government."<br>  ~Henry Kissinger in an address to the Bilderberger group in Evian, France, May 21, 1992.<br>  <br>  "For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate INFLUENCE THEY CLAIM WE WIELD OVER AMERICAN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘INTERNATIONALISTS’ and of conspiring with others around the world to BUILD A MORE INTEGRATED GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE - one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I STAND GUILTY AND I AM PROUD OF IT.<br>  ~David Rockefeller, from his autobiography “Memoirs”<br>  <br>  "We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their PROMISES OF DISCRETION for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to DEVELOP OUR PLAN FOR THE WORLD if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during these years. But the world is now more sophisticated and PREPARED TO MARCH TOWARDS A WORLD GOVERNMENT which will never again know war, but only peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in the past centuries."<br>  ~David Rockefeller in an address to the Bilderberger group in Baden-Baden, Germany, June 10, 1991.<br>  <br>  <br>  So the answer to your question [Dustndwind]  "Right Brian B, but for what reason, other than the complete destruction of civilization." is simple, to force us into a new tyrannical system where we no longer have any resemblance of rights, freedom or privacy. A system where everything is a rule and everything is a crime and where you are issued weekly credits from the government which cannot be saved, and private property is a distant memory. Basically one where you have no control over your own fate. I am not trying to convince you of this, I just hope that as this happens people MAY open there minds enough to see what is really going on.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh one last quote, I think he said it best...<br>  "If the American people ever allow private banks [The Federal Reserve System] to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...

The overhead for running Medicare is 2%. ∠°)|`|EPObVPzVaa	There is no such thing as FREE health care anywhere.<br>  <br>  There never has been and there never will be.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Nothing is free.

They already get free health care from medicaid and similar programs.|`|yrDqtazLaa	Healthcare is a necessity, and it should be treated as such. Any tax-paying citizen should have healthcare made available to them. Insurance is expensive, people who pay for insurance are paying more now for it than they would be paying to have universal healthcare. All it takes is a few dollars out of your paycheck and you have healthcare, versus the 90+ dollars every bi-weekly paycheck for a family to have coverage (plus the deductibles and co-pays you have to fork out along with that).<br>  <br>  Edit: YES, taxes would be raised, but you'd still be paying a LOT less if you don't have to pay for insurance anymore. Get it? Plus, there are many people out there who don't have insurance, OR the money to pay for insurance. They go see a doctor if they need healthcare and get billed for it later. 9 times out of 10, the doctor doesn't get paid. Universal Health Care will take care of that.|`|AA11096726	Well for starters its not free. Someone has to pay for it. Now do we want the government to control this? look how well they have done with social security (broke) medicare (trillions in debt) and almost every other thing they get involved in. If any one can make it not work its the government. Also for everyone to have the same health care and expect top level care is a dream. There is not enough money anywhere for that to happen. Is it fair to force those who can afford to have good heal the care by their working hard to have to settle for less for others many who just want a hand out? Anyone with eyes open can see what is happening in our society as we grow more social in policy-more people choose not to earn their own bred but take a free hand out. By forcing people to earn what they have many more work, and the truly poor have many more people who have more money to support them.|`|AA12365543	We shouldnt because I had to wait 3 weeks to see a doctor when I pulled my neck.

But while in training you will still do scout training. Newly added to the program is building clearing and crowd control. You will learn all these while at your duty station. The 19d scout mos is a glorified infantry position, I say this because you learn all the infantry job plus more. I was a scout for three years and worked closely with tankers. I enjoyed the job (when we actually did it), I did not enjoy the down time. Email me if you have any other questions.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	You won't be doing a lot of scout work and you may or may not be using a Bradley (19D) or tank (19K).

You could be assigned to an armored QRF, but we have been trying to reduce our footprint in Iraq over the last couple years and that has involved taking the tracks out less often and bringing in more wheeled vehicles.

U95m4LhAaa	Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996, was a proposition in the state of California on the November 5, 1996 ballot. It passed with 5,382,915 (55.6%) votes in favor and 4,301,960 (44.4%) against.<br>  <br>  The proposition was a state-wide voter initiative authored by Dennis Peron, Anna Boyce [RN], Valerie Corral (<a href="http://wamm.org)," rel="nofollow">http://wamm.org),</a> Dale Gieringer, William Panzer, Scott Imler, and psychiatrist Tod H. Mikuriya, and approved by California voters. It allows patients with a valid doctor's recommendation, and the patient's designated Primary Caregivers, to possess and cultivate marijuana for personal medical use, and has since been expanded to protect a growing system of collective and cooperative distribution. The Act added Section 11362.5 to the California Health and Safety Code. This law has caused much conflict in the United States between states' rights advocates and those who support a stronger federal presence.

W3NY2E5daa	You might want to consider getting married before he goes to boot camp, this way you will be on his orders to tech school and he will also get extra pay for dependents at the same time.<br>  <br>  I married my fiance while I was in tech school in the Air Force. Because my tech school was 50 weeks long I was allowed to move off base (troops going to shorter schools were not allowed to do this) but because she was not on the orders that transferred me from boot camp to the tech school I had to pay for moving her to the base out of my own pocket.<br>  <br>  As far as base housing since he will not be at tech school that long you most likely will not qualify for base housing. But once he gets to his first duty station he will be eligible for base housing right from the start. The trick will be in regards to how long the waiting list is. I've PCS's to some bases and was told there was a 12 to 15 month wait only to be called 2 months later by the housing office and told they had a place for me. So it all depends on where he gets sent to.<br>  <br>  If he does end up at a base with a long waiting list they will pay for you to stay where you are while he is placed in the barracks till a place on base opens up. We did this when I got out and my wife went in to the Air Force. We were renting a nice house in Florida when my wife was assigned to a base in South Dakota after she got out of tech school. I stayed in the house (which the Air Force gave us housing allowance for) while she was assigned a room in the single's dorms. This lasted about 6 months before we were given a place in base housing.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	In order to qualify for military housing or receiving BAH (housing allowance) you must be married or have custody of a child.  If you are getting married after he has completed Recruit Training and MOS school then you will have to pay for your transportation to where he is stationed yourself, plus the moving of your belongings to that location.  that is only if he has orders to a CONUS (lower 48 states) base.   He can apply for housing and how long it takes to get in there depends on availability.  Until then you will receive BAH to pay for a rental.  You can stay in the rental if you want to and sometimes it is possible to actually pocket some BAH if you find a decent place that is below it including utilities.    If he gets married before he leaves then he needs to notify the Recruiter because this can cause a delay in him going as he has gone from Single with no dependents to Married with 1 dependent.<br>  <br>  When he does get his orders there is also the possibility that he gets orders in which he is going overseas (OCONUS) and that can happen easily.  It also means that you cannot go with him, you will have to stay behind.  You cannot live in military housing but rent a place out in town.  These orders can be up to 2 years in length to places like Japan.  If that happens then he gets BAH for where you are living and Family Separation ($250 per month).<br>  <br>  Some housing is really nice you can't find a place like that out in town.  You do have to pay for internet, cable and telephone.  If housing is PPV (privatized) then you can have to pay for electricity if you go over the monthly average. If you don't then it gets credited to the next month.  Housing doesn't come furnished you will have to do that yourself.  Including washer and dryer only the basic appliances are in there (fridge, stove & dishwasher).  You have to maintain the yard as well, making sure there is nothing on it, the grass is kept cut below a certain amount, etc... They are very strict on that with the Marines.|`|dec64e26728560c9386bd7e032ec26a3aa	I have never lived on base. But I know a lot of people that don't like it and a lot of people that love it.

My concern is that the Obama administration is talking about measures that will accelerate that trend.  <br>  <br>  When there is a problem with a business leader or industry the knee-jerk reaction by our government regulators is to make the innocent pay with extra paperwork, more taxes and more regulation.  Instead of punishing the guilty government punishes the innocent.  Also as an unplanned consequence the government occasionally rewards one business or industry at the expense of punishing another with their tax or regulation changes.  <br>  <br>  Obama seems to be in love with more government and bigger government this causes more problems and more expense for business.|`|rxQt7auLaa	Anti business.<br>  <br>  Let's see if I can explain this simply.<br>  <br>  His plans will increase how much it costs to run a business.

It will be too late, then. Socialists, and Communists hate Conservatives, so any former Liberal turn Conservative will be removed from life.<br>  <br>  I guess Liberals didn't know citizens under these governments don't get rights to Freedom of Speech, to bare arms, privacy, education, or even choice of career. In China, they don't even have the right to have more than one child, but I suppose Liberals don't care about that right either.|`|YonedWiEaa	don't waste your time ..liberals don't understand paying for it because conservatives have always been there to "bail" them out, they only know how to spend, spend, spend, but you are right soon the money will run out and liberals will start crying that conservatives aren't making enough.......little babies.....|`|fL0wHyNNaa	I'm perfectly happy with tax rates being back the way they were with Eisenhower (R).

Your definition of "liberal media" is nothing more thatn YOU think they are not truthful.

Why is it with so many alternative liberally biased media outlets the liberals have nothing better to do than somehow demand equal access on outlets that have the heavy ratings and happen to have a different message.  It must be the quality, coherence and content of the argument that is lacking in the other venues and that are attracting the viewers.<br>  <br>  Go figure.|`|749a6586e68d3ab356d776176fd57b63aa	To understand your question further,one only needs to see the Durbin plan,being produced By Pelosi(today),to attack the radio on the local level,in regional markets,and on its owners(Just what Rush,Levin and Hannity said they would do).This only proves that even with odds of 5-1 in Television media,its a threat to the left.Even in these odds,you can see The attack against the left is working,without dominating the market,or flooding the market with cash to gain dominance and control.|`|EMPVIFmLaa	If conservative viewers constituted enough of a viewing audience, there would be more conservative broadcasting to respond to that demand.

However, he was born into a middle-class family, and he worked his way up during a time in which many more tools existed to enable one to do so. He is also a man of extraordinary natural ability; such individuals usually have no problem succeeding. It's the people who don't possess world-class gifts, but are nonetheless highly talented, who get screwed. Without some mitigating state action to level the playing field, rather than those people assuming the positions of moderate to moderately great responsibility in society, the inept, lazy, and stupid children of the already-wealthy fill them.

Problem solved.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	It was not always this way ... the police could just give a warning and leave.  Then "bad things" happened to someone in the house after the police left.  Somebody "walked into someone's hand" a few more times or arms or legs "just broke".  <br>  <br>  Now the police will be taking someone to jail if they get called to the scene of domestic violence.  Fewer people wind up with broken facial bones from "walking into somebody's fist" that way.<br>  <br>  Want to prevent a return visit to jail?  Help your wife be a little more careful about walking into your hand.  If you get mad and start wanting to hit ... take yourself out of the situation and go for a good hard run instead (if you have been drinking do not drive, even to prevent domestic violence)!  If you run often enough ... maybe instead of going to jail you can enter a marathon!|`|T2WPvUc1aa	I think that maybe they should have made you "walk into their ASP batons", a couple of times to teach you a lesson. If you are assaulting your wife then you belong in jail. You have obviously got a problem. You would be advised to pursue some anger management classes or something like that. Of course after you go to trial you may have no choice but to attend such classes. <br>  Grow up and stop taking your anger out on your wife. There is no reason to hit a woman. If you keep it up you could wind up with felony charges and prison time in the long run. <br>  Here in Texas it only takes one prior conviction for family violence to be a felony offense instead of a misdemeanor.|`|q7v1XAHAaa	She bumped her face into your hand?

You should not expect too much to change in a matter of 2 months that he has been in office. It will take some years to clean up, just as it took years to get in this mess.<br>  <br>  The stock market dropped -777 points in September WHILE Bush was in office. So, you mentioning 40%, there have been bigger drops than that and the market is going to keep falling until confidence in stock and investing is restored. Investors are very shakey right now and aren't interested in losing everything. We are in a recession and people are starting to save more. HOWEVER, this is the best time to buy volatile stocks. <br>  <br>  His cabinet members are all good picks. A few people who had to drop out, but better in the beginning that in the end like Bush had to face. <br>  <br>  Obama is a great president for the job and he will change this country in the years to come. He has already changed policies and is working towards speaking with our "enemies".|`|56fe1840e334cd88069f2645ba55ecd6aa	I consider myself a liberal on many issues, and am usually biased in that direction.<br>  <br>  So far I am unimpressed by Obama.  He does deliver speeches much better than Bush, and seems much more intelligent, but so are most human beings.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I was tempted to vote for Ron Paul, at least he seemed fairly honest and interested in real change and restoring civil rights, and giving more power to the individual states, though I do like socialism in small doses as it seems to work pretty well in Europe. I think socialism might work better on a state level though, and it wouldn't be forced on the more conservative states if state governments had more power.  With states doing most of the governing people could also move to states that are in line with their political views, and more people would probably be happy.<br>  <br>  So far I like Obama better than Bush, I would like a cow pie as President better than Bush, so that alone is not saying much.  The thought of Palin ever being in charge of anything more than Alaska gave me nightmares.  McCain isn't bad for a republican, but frankly Republicans have been in charge for 8 years, and have almost destroyed the country.  I think the current economy is more the fault of Wall Street and the banks than the Republicans, but they sure as hell didn't seem to accomplish anything aside from add to the national debt, and take away many of our civil rights.  A couple of months is too quick for any President to fix the economy (not that I'm very confident in Obama at this point). <br>  <br>  Any economic fix will take years, even with a good President, however, so far I think Obama is spending way too much money, and his big package seems run of the mill for Democrats and uninspired.  It didn't seem to have much that would actually help the economy, though investing infrastructure and green jobs is certainly needed.  Bush already tried $400 tax breaks, and it didn't do crap.   I would have preferred seeing less money spent overall, and more money going to help small businesses.  Like perhaps in the form of low interest loans with easy payback terms.  So many small business would benefit from even small $10k-$50k loans that could be paid back of the course of 20 years or so.  Which would mean more jobs.  <br>  <br>  I do want universal health care if they can pull it off without bankrupting the country, but I think the economy and restoring civil rights should be top priority.  Universal health care can't work if the government goes bankrupt.  <br>  <br>  I don't like gun control in any form, (one area I agree with conservatives).  Every statistic I've read has said gun control does not lower crime.   <br>  <br>  My biggest issues with Bush was his attack on civil rights, the War on Iraq, and excessive government spending (mostly on the war).  So far I don't see Obama trying to reverse the Patriot act or similar bills, and I don't like the government being able to spy on people without warrants, or detain people indefinitely without evidence or trials.  So far Obama seems eager to outspend Bush too, which is very disappointing.  It's a big gamble, and he could end up screwing the country even worse than Bush did.  <br>  <br>  It's way too early to tell if his stimulus package will help the economy, but I'm not very optimistic.<br>  <br>  Frankly I'm beginning to think the Federal government is hopelessly screwed up, and maybe I should become a Libertarian.  Maybe it is time to restore power to the States, then at least voters would have a little more control.  Liberal states could try universal health care and see how it works out.  <br>  <br>  As far as  "keeps nominating tax cheats, liars and lobbyists....", most politicians seem to be tax cheats, or criminals of some sort, and they're all liars, regardless of Party.  It's hard to get elected if you're honest, because you don't kiss everyone's *** and piss more people off.|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	mr.

uAy7Y6HPaa	LMAo,  A chineese General was asked if he thought China could win a war against America, and he just laughed.|`|lMH2cA1kaa	That is an interesting question.But answer is NO. Two reasons:<br>  <br>  1. China can't afford. China is still considered as a developing country as its GDP per person still significantly below the level a developed country would have. Its GDP has been growing rapidly yet still ranked #3 behind US and Japan. China has a foreign currency reserve of 4.5 Trillion dollars. Can they afford the world with this little money?<br>  <br>  2.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Yes, it will be very different 50 years from now.  The change that I see is in the mindset of the citizens.  As a whole, we are less interested in self-responsibility and more interested in having other people (government) take over many parts of our lives.<br>  <br>  In the younger generation, I see a definite trend of wanting to regulate what citizens say and do.  Examples of this are political correctness and the desire for laws against smoking, drinking, eating unhealthy foods, and environmental regulations.  They seem quick to think "There ought to be a law against...".<br>  <br>  This is what they want and this is what will happen.  With more laws and regulations come less individual freedoms.  However, it seems that individual freedom is no longer important to many people.  I see more of a group mentality emerging with little emphasis on individualism.<br>  <br>  My husband and I already tell our college-age daughter what life was like when we were growing up.  By the time she has children old enough to understand, I'm sure it will be much different than it is now (she's not interested in children or marriage right now).  Things are changing fast right now.  I would suppose that all of us on here can remember when we were allowed to keep our medical records private from the government (less than a month ago).|`|ex6fUw8Vaa	Changing into something terrible.

We develop new technology, we deal with new situations in the world, we deal with new problems as they come up.<br>  <br>  Whenever the White House changes hands, the party on the outs complains that America is over, that we are losing our freedoms and all that stuff.  But we deal with it.  <br>  <br>  I know you're wanting to avoid partisan blather here, but I think we got closer to a fascist tyranny under Bush than we've ever been. No president before him has simply ignored the Constitution the way he did--Lincoln being a likely exception (but in his case more justified). <br>  <br>  Now that we have a Democratic president, Republicans are criticizing him in every way they can think of.  But Obama is really only trying to get back to where we were, to give us our nation back.<br>  <br>  The Soviet Union collapsed under its own weight. And we could follow them down the drain of history if we aren't careful.  But we probably won't, because our system allows for corrections and changes of course, and we supposedly have more foresight.   We've been in trouble before, and we always recovered so far.|`|AfaFCiKxaa	The world can't support the way we've been living in any case, so it was going to change.

Bin Laden is dead but Al Qaeda remains the legacy of Gulf War 1 and has given us permanent terrorism.<br>  You may remember that Reagan was pursuing Star Wars while his government was arranging for a passenger jet to be shot down over the USSR's most top secret base, he then 'joked' repeatedly about starting WW3 at that time.  With him demented, his military in control and no way of raising the kind of money competition and virtual slavery can produce the USSR had to negotiate and change or be killed.  I visited Moscow when Andropov was in power, in some respects they lost an awful lot.  Financially the US seems now to be (unbelievably) in almost as bad a position as The British Empire after WW1.  Hopefully w. the Internet and freedom of information no country will be able to pretend to be much more than it is again in our lifetimes.  Propaganda is becoming suspect everywhere.  So yes, and w/out a shot being fired hopefully, being number 2, 3, 4, isn't so bad, no country stays on top forever and number 1 position is a bit of a trap anyway...  More than anything we need the biggest most powerful country to take charge and lead on population control before we become nature's petri dish.

ouEix2a2aa	I have been wondering these same questions....<br>  <br>  It seems the common argument is: These are people, they shouldn't be used for stem cell research; that's turning them into material. But if these same embryos are discarded, what are they then? It seems to be that there's a large logical gap there - they're human if they're to be used in fetal stem cell research, but they're not human if they're to be discarded. The intent determines the status. This is not smash and extract science. People will have an informed choice about what to do - which makes it a lot like first trimester abortion. If you do feel that frozen embryos are really human, here's the question to ask yourself: You live next to a reproductive facility that has frozen embryos. It breaks out in fire. All of the workers get out before the blaze gets bad. You are told the fire department can't make it to the fire, and the building will burn down.<br>  <br>  Do you run into the building to rescue the frozen embryos? Would you answer change if the building burning was an orphanage?|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Not in my mind.|`|HKVFVS4qaa	No, if all functions are over, it is dead.<br>  Just like a regular human, if their heart and brain aren't working, and all signs point to them being deceased, they are dead.<br>  Obama made a good choice.<br>  But whoever is against it can create a serum for eternal life and immunity to illnesses and injury, and THEN, we can stop stem cell research.

In either case though, they will only go back to the date that they can determine, through the medical records, that you became disabled.

The back payments would be for 10 months, or $10,000 plus the cost of living adjustment for the 3 months in the new year. If you contracted a lawyer to plead your case, you would owe him/her about 40%, or $4000.<br>  <br>  There is a five-month waiting period to start drawing SSDI, even if you were approved immediately.

MRE's have imrpoved as well.|`|90d9998cdc55912a39dd589dedde20c5aa	 In basic training, the food varies but no fast food type items.You are served the basics-meat, vegetables, starch.Seasoning is limited if not any at all. This is to prevent gastro-intestinal problems from happening.<br>   Most people are not conditioned to having salty-spicy food and then being outside in the hot or cold all day.Or having to do a road march.The last thing you want in basic is diarrhea or upset stomach.<br>   The above info refers to the dining facility (mess hall).Though sometimes mess hall food is taken to the field during training in Winter.<br>   In the field you you will get MRE's.There is wide variety of meals, including vegeterian meals.MRE's have salt & pepper and tabasco sauce included.|`|CxRdNnvFaa	lol i was about to cadence that exact same thing.... <br>  <br>  Honestly it depends on the CHOW HALL you eat in for the most part they are all good... Hamburgers , hot dogs , eggs , bacon , sausage , you name it in the civilian world we eat it in the army to bro... don't listen to the rumors. Once your at your duty station you even get to pick how you want the eggs cooked and they do it in front of you... i.e. over easy , fried hard, scrambled... But like any food place in the civilian world some cooks are better then others so again it depends strictly on the chow hall.|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	who in the hell told you that? lol<br>  You get your square meals in basic.

After you graduate, it really depends on where you're stationed and what you're doing.  On the field, MREs are actually not that bad.  Makeshift mess halls provide average tasting food, and food on base is alright.  If you want good food, and you're at a duty station rather than deployed, take some of the money and go off base for chow.  I know many Marines whom go to local Japanese restaurants during chow time.  During events like, for example, the Marine Corps Birthday Ball, the swearing in of a new staff officer, change in command, etc, food tends to be very good.  If you have a staff officer present (a staff officer is a 1 star general or better), the food will usually be better in quality.  If a government official is present, and requests to eat with troops, the food will also be better.<br>  <br>  If you want the best food, go Air Force.  Air Force has great food and the best military living conditions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BNwsKBzqaa	The Food is fine ... Don't listen to all the horrible rumors.

But the deployments are about 12 to 18 months long.<br>  <br>  Air Force has better living conditions on most deployments but don't do quite as good a job as the Army as far as taking care of the troops.<br>  <br>  I wish I would have checked into the Coast Guard a little better before enlisting.

He not only is going to ban semi auto rifles and shotguns, but will require a $1,000,000 insurance policy on each and every gun you own.  No different than requiring car insurance.  They will have a very difficult time amending the second amendment.  All they will need to do is make it so expensive that we can no longer own them.  <br>  The week before any legislation is signed into law every supporter of the second amendment should go to the bank and withdraw every dime they have.  Perhaps they would get the message that the people still have the power.  Lets see 80,000,000 gun owners X $1000 = 80,000,000,000 trillion withdrawn from the banking system.

Although, there is a small buzz about the practices that Obama's team utilized during the election that may come back to haunt him like Nixon.  I've been hearing about all sorts of conspiracy theories about newspapers and media such as the Washington Post and MSNBC who were in cahoots with Obama.  News wasn't selling anymore and the idea of the first African American president was needed in order to get people excited about news again.  Also, the Democrats had several counties that had more registered Dems than there were citizens.  Either way, he will have plenty of time to complete his master plan.   <br>  <br>  I personally felt that Condoleeza Rice should have been the first African American president, but the media is still more sexist than they are racist.|`|rxQt7auLaa	Depends on whether he does something illegal or not.<br>  <br>  As much as one might desire it, you cannot impeach a President because you disagree with their policies.|`|h1iSYPOsaa	well if bush stayed as long as he did obama should be around for a while :P|`|tRHE5GMwaa	IDK but i know he LOVEs to eat peaches they r so yummy.|`|q7v1XAHAaa	I hope so|`|564611842b49f5e66f48b5de01e3b249aa	no the impeachment process takes to long.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Before or after drug rehab???|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Well, the last Democratic president was, but not convicted.

BUT anyone would be arrested for the partial birth abortion where they pull the baby half way out for legal purposes and crack it's skull and syphon out it's brains, if you were caught doing it to a puppy.

RFEorR5Raa	the danger lies in people putting their culture above the one of the new land they have come to or live in.  they come here to enjoy the benefits we provide them, yet some want to revert back to the laws and customs of the land they left.  that seems to imply they want to make our country over in their image and forget why they chose to leave.  <br>  <br>  i live in a rural area.  i can tell you that my friends are informed and educated.  education doesn't always mean intelligent as proved by the calibur of so called educated people these days.  <br>  <br>  if you have watched jay leno  'jay walking' where he talks to average people.  they are, for the most part, nice people who have no clue about current events, history or politics.  they do not even know where Trijikistan is located on the map.<br>  <br>  most younger people today cannot do the simple task of counting back change.  wonder how the poster BASH who blasted others in a geographic location would do on this task?<br>  <br>  here is a speech given a long time ago that is even more current today.<br>  <br>  "In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith, becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the person’s becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American… There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn’t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag… We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language… and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.”—Theodore Roosevelt|`|BImIMnbzaa	The problems with so many cultures entering the US today, is they bring their culture, language, traditions, and religion, with them.  They set up shop just like back home, and if their traditions and culture conflict with our own legal system, than it is our legal system that must defer to their traditions.<br>  <br>  Their loyalties for the old country don't evaporate as they once did, instead they embrace their country as its defender against the great satan.  This is where it really gets murky, and our government allows it to be so.  Evidently we have learned nothing from 9/11.  Our government was fully aware of the perpetrators of 9/11. The FBI and the CIA had them in their sights.  The White House was aware of the potential threat, yet everyone sat on their hands until it was too late.

Pretty<br>   soon, all wrappers could have instructions in nine or ten<br>   languages. It gets rediculous. We should let them worship in<br>   their native way etc. but it should not therefore become the<br>   Law of our Land. Also, we should not have to build schools<br>   for those of another culture to learn in. If people come here<br>   to live, they should follow our laws and rules and not expect<br>   US to change our ways to include their ways. English should<br>   always be our language.

33ThRhRhaa	(Love your avatar first of all, couldn't agree more. I'm planning on getting a bumper sticker off the WorldNetDaily sponsored giftshop that says, "NO HOPE in Socialism")<br>  <br>  Ron Paul would probably have done one major important thing that several presidents attempted to do unsuccessfully before, which was to abolish the centralized bank(s). More specifically, he probably would have targeted the Federal Reserve as he has exposed it for the fraudulent system that it is today. In order for the U.S. to disburse and release "money" and "credit" into the system, it has to borrow from the Federal Reserve which in turn lends the (digitized) "money" for circulation, injecting toxic and empty "paper" assets into the economy out of thin air! This is no joke. This is how the U.S. "generates" its cash flow today and is the major reason why we have such severe inflation. You notice this everywhere you go to purchase basic commodities, goods, and services. The prices are high in comparison to the salaries most average, taxpaying Americans receive because the value of the dollar has decreased due to the massive debt piled onto the system by the Federal Reserve. If Ron Paul were to successfully kill the Federal Reserve, we would no longer have to borrow money with interest and we could finally start paying down the debt, allowing more citizens to keep what they make on top of Ron Paul abolishing the IRS, which he has identified as an illegitimate "mob" entity enforcing the graduated income tax scheme through fear and intimidation, although there is no actual substantive law supporting its practice in the U.S. (see also Aaron Russo's "America: Freedom to Fascism" documentary which exposes the Federal Reserve and IRS' heinous and unconstitutional graduated income tax scheme). The power to tax and coin money has been the dream of the one world government (see also "New World Order") elite since the days of old. Without this "power" centralized to a private entity of a few, a one world government would not be possible or feasible. If the United States of America could coin its own money, we would be a prosperous nation once more.|`|obPLuC9Paa	I llike no i love the guy but something we all have to know that alot of the people that are pputting out information and are opposed to the "one world gov" idea are really damage control and others working with the criminals to give the illusion to the public that democracy can work<br>  <br>  But we all know democracy does not work, their fore i dont trust ron paul at all, if you want change you need to start from scratch meaning new country, new leaders, smarter masses|`|if5bmGbPaa	"It's a big idea, a NEW WORLD ORDER", yes well Dr. Ron Paul was nearer to the 'People', I don't think most people on here know just how close this NWO is, they should read this and start thinking.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r210_35.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r210...</a>|`|4xN3ZIhYaa	immediately leave the U.N.<br>  immediately leave NATO<br>  immediately bring back a gold standard<br>  immediately stop the income tax and close our bases all over the world<br>  stop foreign aid and black ops wars|`|OuI5eFcmaa	Ron Paul votes "no" on everything.... not sure how that really accomplishes anything.

The fact is women in the military are more likely to be raped than women not in the military.  1 in 3 women in the American military is raped.  Only 1/3 of all rapes where the rapist is actually found results in court martial (military criminal trial).  It is very possible if you join the military you will be raped and you will not get justice.

vyIWs2UWaa	the short easy story is:<br>  <br>  Car sales have dropped because of the bad economy. Because of this several car companies are in danger of going bankrupt and are asking for government aid. <br>  Some people think they need to get this aid because a lot of people will lose their jobs if the companies go out of Business. Others think the car companies shouldn't be helped because the car companies aren't just in trouble because of the economy but also because of bad management and because they are making obsolete cars compared to some of the japanese and european models. So they figure that it's their own fault and don't deserve the help.<br>  <br>  there is no absolute answer to the question if they should be bailed out. it's a matter of opinion.

The recovery is as important as the exercise.  If you're not already, start resistance training (weights) because muscle burns calories to survive, even at rest.  Get into a regular weight/cardio combination and run, run, run.  Don't forget to stretch copiously, before and after workouts and every time you think about it.<br>  <br>  Suck down as much water as you can possibly hold, as it will help flush toxins and keep you feeling full, as well as keeping your muscles hydrated.  Make sure you still get protein, carbs, and even a little fat in your diet.  You need all three.  Take a multivitamin, to ensure that you're not shorting yourself essential nutrients in trying to diet.<br>  <br>  Keep working and plan to join the army when you're ready, not to be ready when you join.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Hitler held many hysterical beliefs which not only include, God and Providence but also Fate, Social Darwinism, and ideological politics. In Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, he spoke, unashamedly, about God, fanaticism, idealism, dogma, and the power of propaganda. Hitler held strong faith in all his convictions. He justified his fight for the German people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning. <br>  <br>  This is a quote that I think is one of his most revealing statements that makes this quite clear:<br>  <br>  "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."<br>  <br>  o_O|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	He didn't hate Jews per se.

But according to a childhood friend, August Kubizek, Hitler was a "confirmed anti-Semite" before he left Linz, Austria.  Vienna at that time was a hotbed of traditional religious prejudice and 19th century racism. Hitler may have been influenced by the writings of the ideologist and anti-Semite Lanz von Liebenfels and polemics from politicians such as Karl Lueger, founder of the Christian Social Party and Mayor of Vienna, the composer Richard Wagner, and Georg Ritter von Sch?nerer, leader of the pan-Germanic Away from Rome! movement. Hitler claims in Mein Kampf that his transition from opposing antisemitism on religious grounds to supporting it on racial grounds came from having seen an Orthodox Jew:<br>  <br>      ----There were very few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries the Jews who lived there had become Europeanized in external appearance and were so much like other human beings that I even looked upon them as Germans. The reason why I did not then perceive the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only external mark which I recognized as distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. As I thought that they were persecuted on account of their faith my aversion to hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of abhorrence. I did not in the least suspect that there could be such a thing as a systematic antisemitism. Once, when passing through the inner City, I suddenly encountered a phenomenon in a long caftan and wearing black side-locks. My first thought was: Is this a Jew? They certainly did not have this appearance in Linz. I carefully watched the man stealthily and cautiously but the longer I gazed at the strange countenance and examined it feature by feature, the more the question shaped itself in my brain: Is this a German?----<br>  <br>  If this account is true, Hitler apparently did not act on his new belief. He often was a guest for dinner in a noble Jewish house, and he interacted well with Jewish merchants who tried to sell his paintings.<br>  <br>  Hitler may also have been influenced by Martin Luther's On the Jews and their Lies. In Mein Kampf, Hitler refers to Martin Luther as a great warrior, a true statesman, and a great reformer, alongside Wagner and Frederick the Great. Wilhelm R?pke, writing after the Holocaust, concluded that "without any question, Lutheranism influenced the political, spiritual and social history of Germany in a way that, after careful consideration of everything, can be described only as fateful."<br>  <br>  Hitler claimed that Jews were enemies of the Aryan race. He held them responsible for Austria's crisis. He also identified certain forms of Socialism and Bolshevism, which had many Jewish leaders, as Jewish movements, merging his antisemitism with anti-Marxism. Later, blaming Germany's military defeat in World War I on the 1918 revolutions, he considered Jews the culprits of Imperial Germany's downfall and subsequent economic problems as well.|`|f4K08k0Raa	There is a lot of reasons the main one was they controlled all of germany financially and politically. He believed the native germans had the rights to control their land and i agree completely with that.

I dont agree with all the violence but the political side yes|`|5212e090d6f32af9642db85d424eef01aa	there are  supposedly a lot of different reason. a big one was they always had money and his family( parts of his family were servants to jews) did not. he fell in love with a girl when he was a painter and she fell in love with a jewish man, because he was rich and could give her a better life. there are a lot more things like this that go on in his life to really facilitate his outlook.

In the long run, I think its inevitable.  <br>  <br>  Look at how the world is progressing.  Three thousand years ago, the Greek poleis all had their individual currencies.  Two thousand years ago, you had the beginning of a national currency with the Roman Empire's coinage.  As the world grows more inter-connected and the speed of doing business intensifies, economies have kept up by becoming more and more universal.  Five hundred years ago, national currencies existed but only within nations.  Less than a hundred years ago we had two basic economies: Communist and Capitalist.  East and West.  With the advent of the internet rapidly increasing the rate at which business is done and information is transmitted, currencies like the Euro have become not just a possibility, but a necessity.  <br>  <br>  As the world's economies rise above international borders, the world's governments will have no choice but to follow suit.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	I think you shouldn't have stopped taking those pills

According to the US Labor Statistics, there are about 1.4 Million engineers and architects currently working in the US.  That means that well under 0.05% of them think that.  Do you want to tell the other 99.95% they are wrong, or should I?|`|nx7QtF0paa	yes. ask yourself how come no one was fired over it?  Everyone in charge got promoted.

yBgRDe9Vaa	I'm not sure, BUT I believe you can find out online.  For instance, you can google or yahoo: embassies in Japan or the Philippines.  I do know you can ask passport questions online at the United States Embassy in Japan site, but don't know about the others.  You can probably ask for an extension due to circumstances before leaving the Philippines, or at least get the correct answer about what to do.  Good luck, and have a good time/experience! (USA)|`|AA10258539	It will take more than a month if you renew it in Japan as they send it back to the Philippines for processing. The 6 month "thing" is only to enter another country not your own.|`|fecUjSr1aa	where are you? Philippines?<br>  <br>  Have you passport renewed now, before it expires.

T2WPvUc1aa	Well first of all, you don't spend life in jail. You spend life in prison. Jail is where people are held pending trial, or sentenced for misdemeanors. When you are convicted of a felony you go to prison, not jail.<br>  And, as others have said here, usually you can be eligible to go before the parole board after about 20 years or so. Of course that doesn't mean you will get parole after 20 years. It just means that you will be able to have a parole hearing and be considered for parole at that time.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	Life means until you die.

People have a right to choose what, and who they believe in. Have you ever heard of the word Freedom? People have the God Given right, to think for themselves, regardless if others think they're stupid, or wrong.<br>  No Continent, or country is free, if they are made to follow a belief that is not their own. If they do, they are controlled, and usually killed when they don't follow a regime. But, God gave each of us a MIND, to think for ourselves, and even if everybody wants to get along, and always agree, because of that free thinking mind, we never will.|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	Good question.  Many of the EU member states have official religions based on Christianity (including Catholocism).<br>  <br>  But, they are tolerant today of others, like we're supposed to be, so I doubt anything like this would pass.|`|AA10023524	No, there should be no religion anywhere in the world.|`|da2280ec5adee9e8a42fd63e2653ae39aa	No continent or country should have a declared religion.|`|e1e644dd45c14c7ab1b429a5178f108eaa	Well since only about 15% of Europeans are practicing Christians I doubt even they would want it to be a "Christian Continent".

XmMnoNilaa	it offers bigotry,ignorance,racism and hatred,all things needed to believe their "news"|`|52kAiC47aa	some liberals actually think Keith Olbermann is a respected journalist. What's your point?|`|91d19aeb229e9dddf91fda17a6c96bf2aa	Let me try to give you a tip.<br>  <br>  Listen to the network for two years. You don't have to agree with them, but just listen to what they're saying.<br>  <br>  If, down the road, some of what they're saying actually proves what they said earlier is true (which with about 98% of the time the issues they report on are) you'll start to understand what actually IS going on here in America and why they say, "fair and balanced."|`|AA11559456	I guess you have to blame something for your false sense of reality .

Using your own analogy, we should refer to CNN as the Stalinist American News Network.|`|OZ0GBLcJaa	People tend to seek out things that reinforce their own views.  Anyone flipping channels to watch the news is going to have preconceived notions about the world and their place in it.  Some people see Fox/CNN as the truth and others see the opposite.  News is not objective in all cases and necessarily so because it is being reported by people just like us.  I understand this and I accept that it is an unfortunate part of the political process in our country.  It is your responsibility to seek out facts before you open your mouth.  To blindly accept every piece of information coming from a single source is dangerous no matter what your political leanings.|`|fEb9NDCkaa	Ya sort of like CNN and all the local tv stations Oh and dont forget the LA Times and the New York Times.

0Ra1BPVxaa	An immigration medical consists of two parts. First you must go to an approved doctor and do a complete physical exam. The doctor will give you a look over and then you will be asked a series of questions concerning your personal medical history and that of your family. You will be asked about chronic illness, hospital stays, surgeries and STD's among other things. Also about illness and disease in your family such as cancer, diabetes and tuberculosis.<br>  After this you will be sent for lab tests which include blood and urine samples and a chest x-ray.<br>  All of this is done to make sure that you do not have any chronic or contagious illness.<br>  Two years ago I had to pay about 350.00$ to get this done.  The x-rays were quite expensive.  I would plan on spending 400.00 to get it all done today.  good luck.
fSlZQzS4aa	Because I can't swallow the other choices|`|JGjpc7Itaa	We need a change.  We don't need a puppet of George W. Bush and as hard as McCain tries to say he isn't one the facts prove differently.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	Obama is the clear choice. He is sound, calm, intelligent, educated, has actual policies, and really wants to change things, because lets face it, you dont fix what isnt broken, and right now, things ARE BROKEN!|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	It is a way of thinking.<br>  <br>  Why on Earth would anyone want to be a republican.<br>  That bothers me everyday.<br>  I cannot imagine any benefit to being on the right.<br>  What the heck are they thinking.<br>  <br>  I voted for Obama a week ago.<br>  Because I don't agree with republicans.<br>  Obama is a great choice I think.<br>  I like Nancy Pelosi. She is best or she wouldn't be Speaker of the House.   She is the first female Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

His guys have not helped me much at all.<br>  |`|oojO4WAraa	I think McCain is WAY TOO OLD to be president, and Palin isn't qualified to take over.<br>  <br>  Also, the Republicans have sold out to the religious right and I don't want a bunch of religious nuts running the country.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Hmmm, Juicy super star didn't add his vote to kill innocent babies in her list... I wonder why.<br>  <br>  Obama voted against legislation that would help care for babies who survived an abortion.|`|AA11598520	I'm not, but I can tell you why a lot of people are. |`|2RHqRX6caa	You asked for it.. Here is why.<br>  Obama is not a socialist, America is a democracy, the majority rule. If the majority like Barack's ideas and vote for him that means he represents what the American people want, he's a democrat, not a socialist. Majority rules in a democracy, not a dictator, see the difference. What if Barack Obama did the same things as John McCain has done? How can the Republicans even call them selves the party of family values? What if Barack Obama were a divorcee who married his 2nd wife while she was addicted to pain pills which she stole from a charitable organization? What if he left his first wife after she became disabled in a disfiguring car accident? What if he paraded around 5 children on stage during his campaign, one of whom was a pregnant, unwed teenager, another who was an infant? What if he began his relationship with his 2nd wife while he was still married to his first wife? I have heard people say that the media has biased coverage and does not cover John McCain enough, I must say, I agree. I think if Barack Obama had done all of the things John McCain has done, because he is black, he would be judged for it, so the notion that Barack is somehow ahead simply because of his race is ridiculous. With all that being said, I am P.O.ed at Barack Obama for voting for the bail out plan, the American people need to be bailed out, not the wealthy corporations. And also, as far as this whole William Ayers things goes, he blew up a statue at a protest rally in the 60's, Barack was 8 years old at the time. He did not even get labeled as a terrorist back then, he was labeled as a radical. Ayers served his time and now he is a college professor. Are the republicans seriously suggesting that our government allows terrorists to be college professors. Seriously!<br>  <br>  |`|170DwLM5aa	OBAMA<br>  <br>  Why - He has a clear cut plan of action on his website. Not just some words in a speech but a real PLAN that I can see... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  History of Obama (not all just my favorite 10)<br>  <br>  1. He sponsored a law increasing tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. <br>  <br>  2. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.<br>  <br>  3.He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.<br>  <br>  4. During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.<br>  <br>  5. Obama voted in favor of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.<br>  <br>  6. In September 2006, Obama supported a related bill, the Secure Fence Act<br>  <br>  7. Obama sponsored legislation requiring nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks<br>  <br>  8. In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor<br>  <br>  9. He introduced Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act, a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections.Obama also introduced the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007<br>  <br>  10. And lastly, in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges.He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Above all McCain's choice for VP showed me he is not the leader we need. She is sooooo underqualified. Look how many schools she went to and how long it took her to graduate. Although I know its not all about education Palin is an idiot in my opinon, even the people of Alaska hate her. If you cant get the 100 people in Alaska behind you then it must be a problem... <br>  |`|Y6DUXDfdaa	Because McCain sold his soul to win this election.   I liked him eight years ago and pretty much right up to the primaries.  However, in his attempt at getting the nomination he has lowered himself to the very standards and practices that he used to be against.<br>  Selecting Palin as his running mate sealed the deal.  |`|hy45DHxgaa	OBAMA~<br>  <br>  Our Next Prez!<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  7 + Painful GOP YEARS!|`|pbeXkX0raa	we will have bluer skies, cancer will be cured, the whole world will be at peace, and oh yeah, he's giving me some of your money that you worked for |`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	George W.

He may well be one. On the other hand, maybe he's refusing to release his vault copy birth certificate because he's using the issue to try to distract his opponents from something else. If it's not one of those two reasons, then the only plausible explanation is that he's a total narcissist who considers himself far beyond the scope of the very laws he swore to uphold.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	I guess the fact that you have no clue on how the government actually works is proof of Republican ignorance running rampant throughout this Country.

It really turns my stomach.  Yes, they are racist however they claim the opposite and point the finger at whites when they are the ones guilty of it themselves.<br>  <br>  People should be judged based on their own individual actions and character.|`|g71m3S9Naa	I think that Whites can not be racist by no means. While other races can be with out ridicule.  Blacks can be racist and not be punished for doing so.  NAACP sees to it.  The civil rights movement was for the entire nation not just for the African americans.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think that you have to change how you are perceived before there can be a noticeable change.   You know some statistics on races are these. Just shy of 80% of all black children do not have a father figure in their lives.  While just shy of 40% of white children.  When you have multiple children with multiple men is just stupid.  You see there women out here with 5 or 6 children with no daddy.  <br>  <br>  <br>  lets close them legs, get on some birth control.   What would happen if the government put a limit on how many children you could produce.   Look at other countries that do this.|`|EJVKqFiHaa	Back in the 1950's, whites were probably one of the most open and racist groups to exist.

I don't remember seeing black police beating down whites and shooting them with firehoses for daring to ask for the right to vote or eat at a restaurant. I don't recall any cases of whites being brutally murdered for offenses such as whistling at a black woman. I'm not excusing racism by anyone, but can't you understand why some black people might still be a little wary?

In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National Homeownership Month.

He stands for everything that's wrong with the democratic party and American liberalism today.<br>  His relations with Wall Street’s largest banks and finance houses have stood him in good stead. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, he pulled in $1.8 million in campaign contributions in the run-up to the 2006 election. He is well on his way to substantially topping that figure in the present campaign season, recording $1.2 million in contributions by the end of March. Securities and Investment firms were responsible for $164,600 of that money, real estate interests for $156,401, law firms for $130,768, insurance companies for $117,674 and commercial banks for $74,350.<br>  In return, he has dutifully defended these massive financial interests, acting as a key architect of the government bailout of Bear Stearns earlier this year and now the plan to prop up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with unlimited cash from the federal Treasury.<br>  But even given these financial-political relations, Frank’s blunt defense of inequality is a significant testimony to the state of the Democratic Party and American liberalism.<br>  “Equality is not a good thing.” Such a statement stands in diametrical opposition to a long and central tradition in American political thought that—however much it was violated in practice by chattel slavery and the workings of the capitalist system—held equality to indeed be a “good thing.”<br>  For Thomas Jefferson and the other founders of the American republic, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Enlightenment, the equality of man was not just a “good thing” but, as Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, a self-evident truth.<br>  Abraham Lincoln went further, taking equality not only as a self-evident truth, but as a proposition that had to be proven in bloody struggle, a transcendental goal to be realized by American society in a “new birth of freedom.”<br>  In the depths of a Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered his “rendezvous with destiny” speech to the 1936 Democratic convention, again invoking these profound political traditions, while flaying the “economic royalists” of Wall Street as the reincarnation of King George III.<br>  “For too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality,” Roosevelt said. “A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people’s property, other people’s money, other people’s labor—other people’s lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness.”<br>  Roosevelt spoke as a highly class-conscious representative of the American capitalist class, who sought to save the system from the threat of social revolution by implementing social reforms and imposing certain restrictions on the predations of his own class. That was in a period when, even in the midst of the greatest collapse of capitalism to that point in history, American capitalism retained immense financial reserves and benefited from the most advanced and powerful industrial base in the world. The decayed state of American capitalism today, with its massive deficits and shrunken industry, is a far cry from that of Roosevelt’s day. This immense decline in the objective position of American capitalism is the most important factor in the repudiation by American liberalism of any reform agenda.<br>  The inequality outlined by Roosevelt more than 70 years ago has today become even more extreme. It has indeed proven a “good thing” for those at top of the economic ladder, who have amassed obscene fortunes through a vast transfer of wealth from American working people, the overwhelming majority of society.<br>  The share of the national income monopolized by the top 1 percent is now higher than at any time since 1928, not only before Roosevelt, but before Herbert Hoover. Since the end of the 1970s, the top 1 percent has seen its income rise on average by nearly 240 percent, while the majority of the population has seen its real income stagnate or decline.<br>  Yet neither Frank nor any other leading Democrat is sounding an alarm against today’s “economic royalists” or “malefactors of great wealth.” Instead, they present themselves unabashedly as their representatives and defenders.<br>  Frank’s embrace of inequality as a positive good under conditions in which millions are being thrown out of foreclosed homes, seeing their incomes ravaged by soaring gas and food prices and facing the threat of employment is the end product of a protracted and deep decay of American liberalism.<br>  The immense growth of social inequality is at the root of this process. It is to the top 1 percent that Frank and the other leading Democrats are politically oriented. They speak for the privileged social layers—of which they are a part—which have seen their personal wealth balloon at the expense of society as as a whole.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Last I heard he was not the party leader, and he doesn't represent all Democrats.

They resort to the argument, 'Oh that spending is such a small part of the overall package (that we must have in order to save America blah, blah, blah). <br>  <br>  If it's such a small part of the spending bill, why don't they just cut it out!!!!  End of argument. I mean that tiny one or two percent they often cited can't be that important can it? If it were they wouldn't have such a difficult time defending it. <br>  <br>  If someone can form a cogent argument supporting some of these things fine. Let's have an open an honest debate. I have driven by pig farms before, it's not a pleasant experience. But, stinky farms are not the end of the world. To include spending like this in the Omnibus spending bill, designed to fund essential government services, is beyond disingenuous. <br>  <br>  The only thing Obama plans on keeping his word on is that comet about 'spreading the wealth'. As if he personally 'owns' the wealth of this nation and know best what to do with it. <br>  <br>  If this wasn't so serious it would be laughable.
G6yyceAxaa	hey, this budget was wrote last year, they spent months arguing about it then.  the budgets main purpose is to fund the running of the US government. so how about we sign petitions, and shut down everything for a month or so, until your happy.<br>  <br>  Obama didn't want to waste time, redoing last years business, that is why he said, "whatever" on this budget. but this will fall on deaf ears, as long as it is something bad, and Obama is involved.|`|ubrOdZqMaa	Great website, I all ready did.

Have you ever heard of experiements with plants when one is ignored or yelled at & doen't do well & the one that is loved grows. Do you know what the word appreciation means? Have you appreciated what you have? Learn about prosperity & you will see that when things are done with good intentions & you send them out they come came mulitiplied. Actually, whatever the intention is will come back mulitiplied. So if you start a war you lose money despite what may have appeared in history. It is 2009 & history books were cooked but progress was made by the focus that people put on making money....If you stop putting down others such as liberals & open up to learn you can see that being conservative is the hard way to live a good life. We are not made to conserve. Hold your breathe.....Ok let it out. You had to let it to get the new, fresh & vital in & that is the way all energy works.

AA11963685	Part of the effort in Afghanistan has to do with this problem.  The Taliban are operating in both areas very successfully and we are trying to enter this "problem" via Afghanistan.  Pakistan itself may be the biggest problem of his Presidency.  We have tried in the past to control the government there because of their nukes and we failed.  Now we have to look at the possibility that extremists have a pretty good shot at taking over Pakistan and their nuclear cache.  Obama and Clinton have so far been demonstrating a willingness to actually talk to our enemies.  To use our minds before emptying our guns.  It was announced recently that Obama will be reaching out to "moderate" members of the Taliban.  Despite all of the posturing going on regarding our relations with other countries I suspect this is the problem weighing most heavily on both of their minds.  Let's give them a chance to approach this in a way that won't close the door to communications with those who hate us the most - and I'm not talking about terrorist cells, but those high up on the Taliban ladder.  Doing this the "Bush way" will accomplish nothing but a rejection of any moderate policy we suggest to them.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Sigh<br>  <br>  It's depressing to realize that people who visit this site respond more to flame questions than serious questions that actually address the politics of our nation and the world.

They don't want to feel remorse, they only wants to live their lives with their own rules. They want to know more than God. We are just simple human beings created by God Almighty and just because some people don't believe that doesn't prove that HE doesn't exists.<br>  People change religion like if religion were a piece of cloth. When they don't like it, they change it to another one. That is not faith, that is convenience.

A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have never seen."<br>          He described his own work as "a paradigma of his doctrines,"  made by cutting the texts out of the book and arranging them on the pages of a blank book, in a certain order of time or subject. <br>          He told John Adams that he was rescuing the Philosophy of Jesus and the "pure principles which he taught,"  from the "artificial vestments in which they have been muffled by priests,  who have travestied them into various forms as instruments of riches and power for themselves."  After having selected from the evangelists "the very words only of Jesus,"   he believed "there will be found remaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man."<br>           Unlike many observers, Jefferson was able to separate Christianity from its unworthy representatives: <br>          "The Christian religion, when divested of the rags in which they [the clergy] have enveloped it, and brought to the original purity and simplicity of it's benevolent institutor, is a religion of all others most friendly to liberty, science, and the freest expansion of the human mind."<br>  --Thomas Jefferson to Moses Robinson, 1801.

A grown person is in actuality human, so why are people under death row victimized and killed and Conservatives seem to go along with it.<br>  <br>  When conservatives tend to take the opposite approach in terms of a fetus and abortion? To me this is ridiculous in principal cause individualistically speaking to me a fetus in not a living breathing organism until the first 3 months have passed. Therefore, it can be scientifically argued whether or not a fetus is a living organism where on the contrary can be said about one that faces the ills of capital punishment.<br>  <br>  They will die and most of them I might add are innocent from any wrongdoing and just victims of the modern age of jurisprudence. Even if they were indeed criminals do not for any second justify their emminent deaths under capital punishments with your conservative thinking. For, what is an infant a sponge in which could one day harbor the very same behavior as the aforementioned victims of death row.<br>  <br>  For, it is proven that normally the parents that undergo abortion are the ones that would make for the worst possible parents if it were not for them going through with the procedure. In that, they are neglectful, abusive, and anything else you can think of towards their offspring. <br>  <br>  As, the negative behaviors in the offspring metastasize it takes a turn for the worst internally and psychologically speaking. For they tend to turn to a life of crime and evildoing since abuse is all they have known.<br>  <br>  Retrospectivly, speaking if it were not for abortion, a mechanism in the maintanence of the status quo. Crime would run more rampant,which is not the only issue that arises if abortion would be abolished. Another problem that the grassroots would face if the abolishment of abortion would ever occur is that the universe would continue to overpopulate resulting in stagnation of the economy and probably more world hunger, which are already 2 devestating realities society already deals with.<br>  <br>  Once again abortion is a tool that maintains the societal status quo. If a parent/parents do not want the children or if they were victims of rape, incest, or any biological problems the fetus engulfed due to invitro fertalization it can be justified for said parent to go through the process of said abortion. This issue supercedes that of human sexuality and the mind frame most conservatives seem to reiterate in droves stating, "close your legs". This is mumbo jumbo and degrading cause,like I said the issue of abortion supercedes human sexuality and should not be perceived as murder cause other forms of murder are deemed necessary in our society without an utterance of denouncement made from the right side of the spectrum. <br>  <br>  Once more if conservatives see it as a necessity to keep the need for capital punishment intact. Then why can't they agree in principle to keep abortion intact. For, aren't they tools that share compatable desired effects? Capital Punishment and Abortion are not apples and oranges rather the proverbial meatball to the spaghetti base.Both of them seek for resolutions to problems that plague society, so I suggest that both parties take it in all rather than proclaiming it some sort of strife cause these implementations do not seem like they will absolve.|`|um87XJvmaa	The same species as it's mother.  Not a plant since plants don't bear live young.<br>  <br>  Add:  I chose to have my babies.  It is none of my business what anyone else chooses to do.<br>  <br>  Add:  No, the girls do not gather around and wonder.  The mother is human, therefore her fetus is human.  My dog is pregnant, her  fetuses are canine.  Not really  hard for most of  us to understand.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Depends. Which species are you talking about? All mammals spend time as fetuses, after all. In any case, whatever it is it is still only a potential member of that species, as any number of things can happen before birth. And no fetus, removed from the womb, would be either recognizable as a member of its species or able to function as one, let alone survive.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	They comfort themselves by saying it's just a clump of cells.<br>  <br>  Like a wart.<br>  <br>  And people who squawk about "choice" seem to feel it's right to think "I hate my neighbor.

Usually its random, so if they did open it then they would get it translated. If theres nothing bad in it you have nothing to worry about.

Obama voted against a new late term abortion bill before because he felt it did not protect the interests or the health of the mother.  There is already a law banning partial birth abortions except in the case of rape, incest, or the potential health risk to the mother.  I do not see that changing at all.
lMH2cA1kaa	The relationship between China and N Korea is somehow tricky.<br>  <br>  First, the good neighbor relationship was established and determined after the Korean War in early 50's. This fundamental relation theme has not been changed. <br>  <br>  Second, the relation between China and US could have some impacts on China-N korea relationship. That is why China has tried to persuade N Korea to concede on some international issues. <br>  <br>  Third, in the recent years, particularly after China established normal relationship with south Korea, China has been unhappy to each in a number of affairs. China doesn't like N. Korean's attitude towards nuclear situation in the Korean Peninsular not because of the pressure from US but for China's own national interets.|`|yCcLnI1Gaa	They are probably on friendly terms in some respects.

Jacking up prices, bait-and-switch, slumlording, these are all examples.<br>  <br>  A hustler is somewhat that works from windfall to another, like in gambling, selling ill-gotten goods, etc.  Their work is not necessarily illegal, but it's usually sparse and have to do several things at once.
xmQKZzAwaa	No, the iceberg is part of nature and was just floating around its own area like any other iceberg.

xkcLOfTKaa	Define "health care plan"<br>  There are 2 separate and in some cases competing issues here.<br>  1) The price of health care. Government regulation, the cost of education, the cost of LIVING have raised the price of CARE (that is, what a doctor charges) - but here is the bigger problem...<br>  <br>  Most markets in the country are consumer driven. That is, providers (of whatever) will charge what the market will bear (in other words, what consumers will pay) - Health care is no different... but here is the catch. YOU are not the consumer of health care... The INSURANCE industry is (teamed with the federal government)! THEY decide the price of care.<br>  <br>  If you are simply talking about coverage, well... consider that only 15% of the populations does NOT have health insurance. And of those, the government tells us that 1/3 CAN AFFORD IT, but chose not to carry it.<br>  <br>  The COST of health CARE (not coverage) needs to be addressed. But, just like every other consumer industry, the government is NOT the answer...|`|O5KOwhovaa	An American version of the NHS.<br>  <br>  Every other nation in the Western world has shown it is the best medical system to use.<br>  <br>  <br>  Only the US, dominated by self-interested insurance companies, denies this.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I think we should have health care like in Canada.

That way people can choose doctors and care based on price and quality.<br>  <br>  right now few people beyond bookkeepers know how much doctor care costs - not people with insurance and not the doctors.<br>  <br>  Insurance companies can  charge higher premiums to make people be more cautious in their selections.<br>  <br>  If the above is done, insurance companies can give discounts to people who choose doctors with high quality ratings and low costs.<br>  <br>  End the secrecy in pricing!|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	-Allow true free market competition between insurance companies. <br>  -Let the customer choose their level of coverage.<br>  -Open pricing, let us know where our money goes. <br>  -Have customer satisfaction ratings available to everyone.|`|TWLyyYpEaa	where i live we have a county hospital and subsequent depts. that by law have to take care of any and everyone that needs it. the cost, depending if you don't have medi-cal or medicare is low. to those of you think that socialist type care is better by all means go to canada.|`|buiHdl0Gaa	Visit Canada and read the statement of principles of our universal health care system. It's a world leader - despite it's shortcomings. And don't believe all the negative things the American system says is wrong with our system - that garbage is put out by the millionaire AMA members and the pharmaceutical industry. As an example, common drugs in Canada cost a fraction of what Americans pay !|`|c2f7b7e7c197d88a1a3ae7caa8ff6fc2aa	The government should not be involved in health care in any way. This is the fundamental problem with your premise. It is ONLY because of government involvement that health care is expensive now. The solution is to get government out entirely.<br>  <br>  "Their prescription costs should be based on ability to pay" ??? WTF kind of childish drivel is that? I don't know what kind of job you do, but how would you like it if the government passed a law saying you had to set your prices according to your customer's ability to pay? You would be out of business in a month. Stop trying to find "feel good" solutions to problems and start using your brain.<br>  <br>  Putting a gun in the face of your neighbor to pay for your health issues is evil. This is why government should not be involved. They don't ask you to help, they put a gun in your face and force you to. I'm sorry you are a bad parent and fed your child nothing but Twinkies and soda, and now they are obese and have diabetes. Sucks to be you and your kid. But I work hard for my money and I have a right to use it for my child's education or my flat screen tv and not for your kids dialysis. If you don't want to be sick, then eat right, exercise, wash your hands, and don't sleep around. That will prevent 99% of your health issues. If you have a health issue, you are free to ask me to help. But when you stick a gun in my face and steal my money, that makes you an evil monster. The ends do not justify the means. Stealing "for the children" is still stealing.|`|TBvUomw7aa	Just let the market set itself.  In a perfect world or on a small scale, nationalized health care would be ideal, but the truth is that it is abused profusely and your care would be even crappier than the care that you currently get...which doesn't seem possible.  The government shouldn't intervene.  They shouldn't make any laws requiring you to have health insurance.  Let the market set itself.  For now, it is expensive as all hell, but there will be companies that will charge a helluva lot less in the future.  It is expensive right now because there is no competition.  Wait it out.  It is like any other industry.  Besides, if people quit suing everyone, the doctors wouldn't have to charge so much money.  And give the pharmaceutical companies time.  Someone will jump in and come up with something better for cheaper.  It has always been going this way.<br>  <br>  How about this one...quit being panzies!  Do you really need to go to the doctor every time you get a cut?  Every time you get a cold?  I am 27 years old, I haven't been to a doctor short of an annual physical for work since I was 21.  I have been sick as all hades and have had my fair share of injuries being that I am extremely active and I am healthy as can be.  I realize that not everyone has that kind of luck but we are a nation full of consumers that hears about a medical problem and automatically assumes that they have that or something else.  Quit drinking the tap water and realize that you probably don't have insomnia, a personality disorder, RLS or any other POS that the AMA creates each and every year.  Stock up on vitamins, ibuprofens, tylonels and next time you are in Mexico, grab some antibiotics.  That's all you need.<br>  <br>  On another note, your medical records are about to be in a database and public information.  Do you want your future employers to know about all of your medical problems?  Open up your ears...there are plenty of Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese and Mexican doctors that work out of their basements for cheap that know what they are doing...just lack the US licensing.|`|mo3PnlXXaa	making use of the SE such as google or yahoo to generate some ideas first if you would like to get the massive information,nonetheless if you would not  want to put so much time,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a direct and useful resource for your questions.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	You say that "all people with AIDS, MS, Hepatitis, SCA, and Diabetes" must have help and deserve the best help available.

Hopefully we complain loud enough that they leave it alone.<br>  <br>  I agree that hospitals and doctors and pharmacies could lower their costs.  Other than that, LEAVE IT ALONE!<br>  <br>  255 million Americans have health insurance.<br>  <br>  45 million don't, but they get emergency care no matter what.<br>  <br>  Let's screw over the majority with mediocre health care to cover the minority.

PwQn0Oixaa	First off, the big problem is that these bonuses and pay are contractually obligated.  The companies who want these "great minds" set up these big deals with them, and thus these bonuses and such are more or less part of their pay.  Unfortunately too many companies don't go deep enough on tying them to "good performance"...so they get paid regardless of how many people get laid off and how bad the business is run.<br>  <br>  We are the only country I've seen where you can run a business into the ground and yet receive a killer severin's package, even if all your employees lose their jobs and retirement funds.<br>  <br>  The argument I hate is when those at the top say if they can't get their bonuses then they will leave, and thus the company won't have real leadership.  Um...6-7 figure salary AND millions in bonuses?  I'm sure there are thousands of qualified people out there that would do it for a high 5-figures and no bonuses.<br>  <br>  Blame the companies for making these stupid deals to get what they think are "brilliant minds".|`|xkcLOfTKaa	First of all, the bonuses paid to the execs are for past performance, part of past budgets and are CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED! (think of the law suits that would happen if the federal government mandated restrictions... WOW)<br>  <br>  Next, why do you care? How does it affect you?<br>  Doesn't the federal government's spending of TRILLIONS (of YOUR dollars) it doesn't have affect you more?<br>  <br>  Why does the White House insist on reminding us of things that simply don't affect us to diverts us from things that DO???|`|KDxTxhXHaa	That is how it works at the top and those are the people the repubs would like to protect.

The bonuses you're referring to are more like commissions and account for 40-60% of their annual compensation.

Even worse, millions of families will see the bulk of their savings disappear as homes in some of the bubble areas lose 30 percent, or more, of their value. Foreclosures, which are already at near record highs, will almost certainly soar to new peaks. This has happened before in regional markets that had severe housing bubbles, most notably in Colorado and Texas after the collapse of oil prices in the early eighties. However, this time the bubble markets are more the rule than the exception, infecting most of real estate markets on both coasts, as well as many local markets in the center of the country.<br>  <br>  In this context, it's especially disturbing that the Bush administration has announced that it is cutting back Section 8 housing vouchers, which provide rental assistance to low income families, while easing restrictions on mortgage loans. Low-income families will now be able to get subsidized mortgage loans through the Federal Housing Administration that are equal to 103 percent of the purchase price of a home. Home ownership can sometimes be a ticket to the middle class, but buying homes at bubble-inflated prices may saddle hundreds of thousands of poor families with an unmanageable debt burden.<br>  <br>  As with the stock bubble, the big question in the housing bubble is when it will burst. No one can give a definitive answer to that one, but Alan Greenspan seems determined to ensure that it will be after November. Instead of warning prospective homebuyers of the risk of buying housing in a bubble-inflated market, Greenspan gave Congressional testimony in the summer of 2002 arguing that there is no such bubble. This is comparable to his issuing a "buy" recommendation for the NASDAQ at the beginning of 1999. More recently, Greenspan has done everything in his power to keep mortgage rates as low as possible, at one point even offering markets the hope that the Fed would take the extraordinary measure of directly buying long-term Treasury bonds. The man who testified that the Bush tax cuts were a good idea apparently has one last job to perform for the President.]<br>  <br>  By totally ignoring the problem.|`|525m5qrTaa	I leave it at this; <br>  <br>  It was none of and all of our faults...|`|G6ein0naaa	Bush didn't cause this crisis. <br>  <br>  It all started with Clinton when he pushed for less stringent credit and downpayment requirements for the working and middle class (being the Democrat that he is and supporting the working class). <br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates. <br>  <br>  Home buyers took advantage of the easy credit. <br>  <br>  Congress supports a mortgage tax deduction. <br>  <br>  Real estate agents made more commission by selling more expensive homes. <br>  <br>  Mortgage brokers offered less-credit-worthy home buyers subprime, adjustable rate loans with low initial payments, but exploding interest rates. <br>  <br>  Alan Greenspan encouraged Americans to take out adjustable rate mortgages. <br>  <br>  Wall Street firms paid too little attention to the quality of the risky loans that they bundled into Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), and issued bonds using those securities as collateral.<br>  <br>  Bush was oblivious, and failed to provide needed government oversight of the increasingly dicey mortgage-backed securities market, but he DID NOT RUIN THE HOUSING MARKET. He didn't help it though.

After all as Comrade Biden says: It is patriotic to pay more taxes.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I think it shows a total lack of empathy on his part but there again is his narcissist personality.  However, I don't think he is responsible for giving anyone a house.  That is just not the gov't's job.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	yes, no matter how poor you are you are not going to make another person richer by being poor. I am inspired by the parties. I want to start having great parties every weekend. It doesn't cost much. Each person spends a lot but they are helping others with all they spend. They food is purchased by places that are actually local growers & this is helping them to be more prosperous. The clothing people wear help the sellers & sewers & even goodwill when they give the clothes away. Stop being jealous of people. When you see something good look at it & say "I can have that too!" Maybe if you stop being so negative you will get invited to more parties...think about how illogical your question is & pray to have a clearer mind & you will see the only people who can give your a straight answer. well no one can. If you are looking for losers to sit by your side & say "yeah, look at them having fun" you are in for a miserable life. Those parties help more people than they hurt.

More parties then any other president?  Get real!  <br>  He isn't "partying", he's working.  Things like this go with the job.  <br>  <br>  Let me get this straight, if he didn't invite heads of state back to the white house for dinner and didn't invite key congressmen and senators to meet them, you'd be all up in arms complaining about that too. I can hear it now;  "he's so rude, he doesn't even entertain so and so from wherever."  You can insert your favorite foreign country.  Have fun.|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	So you are claiming that in 6 weeks he's had more parties than president's who were in office for 8 years?  That's just flat out wrong.  I had a party last weekend...I guess I shouldn't have, eh?  <br>  <br>  Don't his parties employ people?  The people who raise the food?  Who sell the alcohol?  Who prepare the food?  Etc?  Is he not keeping businesses open by purchasing things from them?  Why don't you care about those who would lose their jobs?|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	Would it make you feel better if he just sat around and was miserable during his free time.  I couldn't care less.  If someone told me Bush was having parties during these times, I also couldn't care less.  <br>  <br>  How do you know we are paying for his parties.  He is not exactly poor.  Plus, I am sure here is an allowance in his budget which he can use any way he likes.  <br>  <br>  Quit complaining about everything.|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	You have to understand that they are celebrating THEIR victory.

cd3db14d1e54f8f56d160141b3b7357baa	As long as the media hides that fact that this mess was caused completely by a handful of democrats, they will never realize the truth.  If any republicans had been involved their faces would have been plastered on the front page of every newspaper.  Since it was all democrats (Carter, Clinton, Raines, Frank, Dodd, Pelosi, Schumer...) they suppress the facts.<br>  <br>  These Obamabots still blame Bush and ignore the fact that we had the most robust economy in our history up until 2007 when the democrats took over congress.<br>  <br>  They ignore facts like a stock market high of 14,000 during Bush and how it has dropped to 6,000 under Obama and is still going down.  Obviously Obama is bad for business and the economy.  No question about that.<br>  <br>  Facts don't lie, but don't expect them to get the facts or believe in them any time soon.<br>  <br>  We'll be crashed and burned and they'll still blame someone else.|`|mkCjcG5oaa	I really like that chart!<br>  <br>  This is my take on it.<br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^DJI#chart1:symbol=^dji;range=5y;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^DJI#...</a><br>  <br>  If you look at 2003 (I had to go with 2004 on the link since it didn't copy over right), that's when the bubble started and 2007 is when it ended.

I don't know how Obama owns this depression since Bush was in office at that point and it looked like Hillary was going to be the Democratic candidate.|`|AA11151307	No. You're wrong.

0me6vDF3aa	The problem with Obama's programs is that it will delay any correction!<br>  <br>  So many Obama supporters say that he is so much like Roosevelt, well Roosevelt's liberal programs probably kept our other depression going many years longer than it should have!  If it wasn't for World War II who knows how long the depression would have lasted!   Our depression ended because our WWII workforce was producing tanks, ships, planes, jeeps and even growing food to feed the world - not because of liberal programs!<br>  <br>  Every time Obama opens his big mouth the stock market takes a dive, will any retirees have 401 k's left to support them or will the market correct itself first?<br>  <br>  I think Obama believes that  if people are in a position to have money in the stock market or even private retirement plans they must have cheated some black person or didn't really "work" for that money!   This is from a guy that never had a real job in his entire life - a job that he actually has to perform labor!<br>  <br>  As long as the press takes the liberal side President Bush will never get any credit!   Forget that the democrats ran congress for the past 2 years and the banking crisis is a democrat fabrication - Bush will get the blame!   Even with Barney Frank saying everything is okay while taking sweetheart loans (along with Dodd and Reed) President Bush will get the blame!<br>  <br>  Just like Rodney Dangerfield says "I get no respect!"  President Bush will never get any proper respect from the liberal press!  <br>  <br>  The only light at the end of the tunnel is when members of the liberal press keep loosing THEIR savings more and more - then perhaps they will condemn Obama!|`|8l2IMrsFaa	No, why should they, President Bush "stayed the course" while The DOW collapsed.<br>  The DOW did plunge more during Bush's term by the way..<br>  Just how long has capitalism ALWAYS corrected itself anyway?|`|K71Qoakwaa	We never said everything is Bush's fault.

Everything good that happens will be a result of Obama's policies (in their eyes).  Wait and see.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	That's like Europeans thanking Hitler for the Marshall Plan.|`|0jLL9GIsaa	I don't think the markets are being allowed to correct themselves.|`|D9AUzmZRaa	It just makes me weep to see such ignorance.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	as WE all know<br>  <br>  bush drove it over the cliff<br>  <br>  <br>  when it recovers it will be because Obama was brave enough to take the bold steps needed for recovery|`|EPObVPzVaa	Clouds are Bush's fault.<br>  <br>  The sunrise is a gift from 0'Bama|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	As long as liberals and people with entitlement mentalities keep tinkering with it, it will never correct itself.  If we can't get them to back off and let it run its course, we can expect "recession" to be the new normal.|`|xo7Ea5fZaa	No.  They will claim it was all Obama's brilliance.<br>  Although his current policies will not help us out of this recession, just extend it.|`|THNvhp3Caa	I'm trying to see things from your point of view, but I can't quite get my cranium that far up my colon.|`|cMHxg372aa	Doubt it - which one of his policies would be responsible for that?
DY9NOh4taa	That is correct, however the Democratic Mafia with Pelosi as their Capo, will continue to blame former President Bush, even though he has been retired for almost 2 months now, and there is no improvement in the economy, shows that Obama is clueless and has no idea of what he is doing.<br>  Unlike 9/11/ 2001, Bush was confident and upbeat, while vowing that those who were responsible for the attacks would pay. Obama should be doing the same thing with the economy, and those corporate executives that looted companies like a kid loots his piggy bank, when he hears an ice cream truck. Should be held accountable for their actions, and put on trial, instead Obama gave them more money in which to stick in their pockets and declare that nothing can be done to help the situation.<br>  Evey speech that Obama gives, sends the stock markets in an almost 100+ point decline, then Obama comments "I would be lost without my teleprompter", the devise that puts Obama's speech up where he can read it to the public, without having to look down.<br>  Obama owns this financial situation right down to the last penny, which brings the question of Why did Pelosi get 30 million dollars for a rare mouse in the San Francisco Bay Area, when thousands of California residents are homeless, and without jobs?<br>  At the same time Obama will be stealing the crown from Jimmy Carter as the worst President in history, a dinstinction, that he has had since 1980. I'm sure that he doesn't mind giving it up though, he almost lost his passport for meeting with the leaders of Hamas, who are classified as a terrorist organization, and not sent there by the President Bush. Rice wanted to revoke it, but Bush held off, only having a month left in office, he didn't want to get into another pi**ing match with the Democrats, it wasn't worth it, it was almost vacation time.|`|T0pkW783aa	Bush, at least was working towards keeping Americans safe and had a high rating when 9/11 happened.  Obama's Presidency, so far has been a total disaster.  When an inexperienced Socialist is voted in as leader of the Nation, it is bound to be a failure!!  The economy cannot get better when no jobs are being created, the spending is totally out of control, the taxes are being raised and there are no workable solutions being put into place.  We are being buried in debt, people are losing jobs and homes on a daily basis and Obama keeps promising more "spending" and more programs for providing for those who don't work, don't want to work, or are here illegally.  Obama still has a pretty high approval rating but it will tank very soon.  We cannot continue spending and losing jobs at this rate.  The Nation will turn on the Messiah and he will lose out on his star status.  God help us all!!|`|WrdqwbTsaa	No, according to the democrats, it's still Bush's fault.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	then Reagan owns the recession in 1983?<br>  <br>  and W in 2001?  you have proved that trickle down doesn't work.<br>  <br>  thanks.|`|4ABrY8Bdaa	Not just Obama, but the Clinton Administration that raped our military power, failed to acknowledge terrorism and the horrifying policies of libs have driven this country into such a low and even people would look to an unexperienced, socialist for help, whom indeed is driving us further into a depression to a point where even libs, are becoming un-brainwashed and fighting against them.

In a perfect world the bailout plan would work, but guess what:  it's not.  People aren't going to change their selfish ways, especially now that they're getting unearned money from the government.  And a lot of the people who voted for Obama knew they would get it.  It's like a bonus on their nonexistant paycheck from their nonexistant job.  If everyone in our country cared about our country, we would be in good shape.  But people think it's easier to squirt out babies and run on welfare.  What a bunch of ******* idiots.|`|ekkFxLH7aa	That is correct, it is all Obama's now, double standards of course will try to be applied.

0Ei3ePJzaa	As a lucky mother of two gorgeous boys, of course I want everyone to have happy healthy babies.<br>  <br>  However, I am not so blinkered as to let my own personal circumstances cloud my answers on questions such as these.  Some women require abortions for a multitude of reasons.  Should we force those who would die from pre-eclampsia or extreme blood pressure to continue with pregnancies?  <br>  <br>  I would ask pro-lifers, what about the life of that mother?  Is hers not worth a damn because she is not little and cute?  <br>  <br>  In this modern age where society is so scorn-full of mothers, and so disgraced by people adding to the number of people in society why on earth are we so insistent that women carry on with a pregnancy regardless of whether it is right for her or not.  Accidents do unfortunately happen, even with protection (I am not speaking from experience, but from the jargon on condom packets everywhere) and why is it that the man walks away totally blameless in this, and questions are asked as to whether the woman should be killed because she makes what could be the hardest decision of her life?<br>  <br>  For those who say "she should give it up for adoption", all I can say is, they have never given birth, and held a child.

The 8th Amendment (and subsequent case law) ensures that punishment fits the crime, so you can't put someone to death for a crime that isn't murder (at present standards).<br>  By present legal standards, if abortion were illegal, only jail time would be an allowed sentence for the 'crime'.  If there was a rider to that legislation that stated X weeks of pregnancy/development = human child, then a woman could be tried for 1st degree murder, wherein the death penalty could be requested.|`|cfa96832d4bc6849f245fc1b2328aa42aa	Would you put to death a woman who was pregnant due to being raped?<br>  <br>  I dont believe in abortion as a kind of contraception but in some cases I think it is the only option. <br>  <br>  To any one who thinks that even if you are raped you should keep the baby if it ever happens to you we will see what you will do!!!|`|JIQ537f1aa	Babies are innocent and don't deserve to die, murderers do deserve it|`|AA11206283	Of course not.

It is generally a part of back channel diplomacy to solve many problems which are if handled with wide publicity, may get sabotaged, resulting heavy losses. Many purely anti-Pakistan & deadly anti-Musilm  leaders, diplomats, former army chiefs, former professors of defense studies of prominent universities, intelligence personnel, film actors, scholars & jounalists too visit Pakistan as a part of peace process, business deals & useful information sharings, useful for this zone as a whole, one cannot remain in isolation & close all channels b coz of difference on few things. That is not a realistic approach. Kuldip Nayar, Khushwant Singh, Raj Singh Dungarpur, Late K R Malkani, Shatrughan Sinha, Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji, L K Advani, all  have visited Pakistan during high tension periods between the two nations. Some visit regularly every year or 6 months. Many have said  no beggar is visible there, nor people sleeping on footpaths, no cycle rickshaw , no hutment colonies except Aurangi & Korangi of Karachi, none urinating outside & no Kolkata type 20 feet high garbage pyramids, rooms in metro cities being bigger than the same in India, more mutton & chicken eating people being there compared to India & 'common people are better fed & have more average height than Indian ones but the govt. there being poor & people being richer but reverse being in India'. Malkani, Shartughan Sinha, Khushwant Singh & Advani acknowledged that. Advani, who is 'absconding for Shikarpur murder case', attempting to murder Jinnah in 1946-47 is most wanted for trial, visited Sukkur, Sindh & erlsewhere for Sindhu Mela & inauguration of construction of many abandoned Hindu temples in Pakistan for devotees. Many Sikh leaders regularly visit & are given similar honour. Many visit without passport & visa formalities too. These things are not understandable to many & hence such questions arise.  Current situation is not permanent. For future, channels with neighbours remain open for smooth processes of govts in both nations. Soon, in future, India will import surplus power from Pakistanin Punjab & coal from Baluchistan. Iran-India gas pipeline WILL be a reality. B coz of temporary tensions all ties are not snapped. Govts work for LONG TERM benefits, NOT volatile emotional issues. Any party in power in both nations will follow that as per International Law. Govt offices understand everything, few common people cannot & hence react uncommonly, unnecessarily.<br>  TV s show only things of their interest, NOT everything. They don't even know what happen behind the curtain, not even 0.1 % & keep guessing.<br>  Musharraf has one UNIQUE quality which many politicians don't have. He conducts lengthy press conferences even without having any text at all , answering every question with fitting replies blow by blow such that  journalists at the end run out of questions & they have to ask him "Shall we go ?" & he says," It is upto you ." Otherwise, most of the leaders in both nations dread eminent journalists & give evasive & short answers only. He challenged several times any Indian leader, scholar, legal expert  or any expert on anything to have guts to come to talk to him uninterruptedly on burning issues of this zone including Kashmir till finally the solid & permanent solution is reached but none so far dared to go forward. This was published in all Indian newspapers many times including Sunday Mid-Day too. He is so much thorough on disputes between two nations that none of even so far greatest leagl experts from India dared to face him. It is reality. Indian legal case on Kashmir issue is EXTREMELY WEAK, people of full knowledge & legal understandings know vey well. Just compare that with the same of Junagarh & Hyderabad, by reading V. P.

d24525de43ba28019e73bdec2b08f385aa	Trickle-down works, but only in a free market, where market forces are allowed to function without coerced outcomes.  And it works over the long term.  You can't have a free market for one day and then say "where's my trickle-down riches?"  The fact is, from about 1990 to 2005, the lowest quintile of the economic spectrum was the most upwardly mobile, in terms of percentage growth in wealth.  When we had the freest markets (i.e., late 19th, early 20th centuries), we had the most upwardly mobile lowest quintile.  That means wealth did indeed trickle down.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way: would you rather be a rich man in the 17th century, or a poor man in 21st century America?  A rich 17th century man gets to eat the best wild hog, has the nicest horse-drawn carriage, poops in a golden pot, and can travel across the continent in a mere six months.  He has never heard of telephones, televisions, or even sanitation.<br>  <br>  Even a poor person in the 21st century lives better than that.  Still think trickle-down doesn't work?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Zaphod, did you even read the article you linked to?  Where does Greenspan mention trickle-down in  your article?  <br>  <br>  And maybe you should read a book before calling people morons.  Alan Greenspan "invented" trickle-down?    Ever heard of a guy named Adam Smith?  Born in 1723?  Let's just say the theory is at least as old as he is, even if he didn't use those exact terms.<br>  <br>  Name-calling is not a substitute for actual cognitive thought.  Maybe this is the wrong forum for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bryan, I suspect that the two people who gave you a thumbs down are the same two morons who gave Zaphod a thumbs up.|`|MOALBorJaa	No "trickle down" does not work. Trickle down = trickled on. The alleged theory behind trickle down economics is that the government gives tax breaks and other forms of welfare to the wealthiest sectors of society in the hope that they will then invest in companies in the United States and create jobs here. Instead, they take the money and put it in tax havens in Switzerland the the Grand Caymens and open up sweatshops overseas and put Americans out of work.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I think so but I wonder where all of the hatred for the rich and small business owners has come from.

So we to maintain our current socio-economic structure there are only two real alternatives. Wealth redistribution from the from the top 5% who profit from globalization, or the establishment of massive tariffs to create middle class industrial jobs again. Since the top 5% gain lots of profits from the lack of such tariffs they will not allow it to happen. They apparently would prefer to pay more taxes on their profits to keep the disappearing middle class from falling into complete poverty rather than have the tariffs. Otherwise the people would revolt and we would end up with some form of extremism whether from the left or the right. The only other option would be a true democratic socialist revolution and not more corporate welfare like both democrats and republicans love to hand out.|`|XTopfG8Taa	Said No!|`|zpjpqdKYaa	Maybe  he is sure fixing the DJI well lol|`|db48dc23f23b23691bf920ff83b525d4aa	No and here is why.<br>  <br>  All throughout human existence, humans have had to compete, whether to survive or with each other. That is after all most of the reason the Olympics were started. We still compete today and it has gone back to survival competition.<br>  <br>  Redistribution of wealth is synonymous with socialism. Basically, there is a governing body that dictates to the people how much they are allowed to have and the working class is responsible for generating the wealth of the governing body.<br>  <br>  That takes away that basic human instinct to compete. Nobody really has to compete any more since there is no benefit to be better than the next guy. You don't have the opportunity to better your circumstance unless the governing body says you can. <br>  <br>  Seems to me that just ain't fair. So at some point the working class will not want to work as hard and therefore less is made available to the governing class. As those in socialist countries what was happening to their economies and industries.<br>  <br>  Is it not better to take advantage of the human characteristics inherit in all of us? Would not the country be better off if individuals were allowed to be as good as they could be? I know I would rather be able to be all that I can be and recoup the rewards be doing so. What about you?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  People, Oprah makes how much a year? OK, now if we limit her to the $250k limit that Hussein Obama says he wants to do, then look at what happens. Oprah's personal chef, personal trainer, gardener, housekeepers, carpenters, etc., all become unemployed because she no longer has the money to pay for them. Further, all those people that provide personal services like an agent, makeup artist, driver and such all too would be out of work. So what are they going to do now for a living? And since she only makes $250k annually now she can't afford those many different automobiles and those luxury items that she currently enjoys. So what happens to those companies that make those luxury items? They close shop. So now does this sound like a good thing, the re-distribution of wealth, whether you call it that or socialism or just taxing the wealthiest top 5% of the population. No matter what you call it, it directly affects the middle class who pay 90% of this country's expenses. <br>  <br>  Open your eyes and ears and learn a little economics people!|`|pi5WKPNwaa	Only if you are for Socialism and the end of Liberty and Capitalism. If he keeps taking from the rich the poor are the ones that are going to feel the real blow. The rich will stop spending money, stop opening new business and hiring employees to run those companies. Obama's idea of wealth redistribution is the opposite of everything that has made this country great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|pRpgbuqiaa	Well, the way I see it, if the government is in financial troubles (which it is) there really is no choice but to ask those who have $500,000,000 or more to assist with financing certain things. Such as infrastructure repair. Most of the United States has bridges (car and train) that have to be replaced. If they are not replaced, people could die. I don't think someone with that much money should mind, since it is a matter that affects them, and, they have the money.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	I wish you neo-cons would stop using that term since it is not anywhere close to being true nor is it anywhere at all accurate...wealth distribution denotes taking from one and giving to another.

Why is he punishing people who worked hard for their money and giving it to bums?|`|1003eb21bd98cd41c4dd726752cefafaaa	if Obama is to achieve HIS "change", then He must  impose taxes on every source (not just the rich or business) the only other income source is trade which he cannot control too heavily or other traders (nations) will find new cheaper sources). <br>  ...The Government MUST be able to acquire info on everyone and everything in order to insure that they can find and collect their "due". (do u really think that electronic medical records will actually improve your medical care??? Or that the data collected will be totally secure?? (ask the military folks how many have received notices from the GOV that their ID and medical data/records  have been compromised and they may be at risk for ID theft!!! usually its due to an "unsecured server"  ...FYI.. the pentagon is routinely hacked and nosy folks with "access" can check up on Joe the plumber)<br>  ...Once the wealth or income is located ,then those with incomes no matter how small must be taxed . Those with limited or no incomes will also be subjects to taxes on  ALL necessities(food,fuel,housing PLUS whatever the gov  and the states decide is a "luxury"coupled with additional taxes on usage /consumption waste all based on some gov "study" that determines what is the "average" for an individual,couple, 4 member family etc). each kid will be allotted so many diapers (trash per week) excess water/utility use will be subject to additional fees, licensing the "wrong " kind of car will be megabucks etc.  <br>  ...Once all the $$ can be skimmed from anyone earning $$, then the Gov is in a position to select what,how/who shall receive services or access to whatever  (ex. the "extra" water usage or utilities or products (ie. gov says a family of 4 should use no more than xx rolls of toilet paper after all we can save the planet / cut carbon taxes/ stop using waste landfills etc  thermostats set above below gov mandates will be subject to additional taxes and fines).Who knows maybe families with an obese member will have to pay if they consume more sugar /carb products than the value set by some Government algorithm /study that determines "ave" usage.<br>  ...Simply put, REDISTRIBUTING WEALTH and or "acquiring "parity" is all about expanding the power of the GOVERNMENT. It is a back door to re-writing the US constitution which so far has the Government subject to the will of the people.  The USA's success results from the simple fact that the Government can NOT oppress "the people"!. The government can NOT"rule" by decree or arbitrary law/rule/mandate.The people select their representatives and can vote them out or see that they are prosecuted for criminal fraud.  (Under what authority does a Congress pass legislation that has not been published such that the "people" are kept in the dark????). Even the press is being shut out (or on board with the new administration.<br>  King George arbitrarily imposed taxes/rules /laws and our ancestors paid with their blood to acquire freedom from oppressive and arbitrary government "Rule"!  Has AMERICA changed such that we really want someone to tell us what to do ,when to do, what we may have,use eat,produce, or acquire regardless of need (think medical treatment or allocated living space or type of home ) <br>  <br>    The government is to protect and defend the NATION not seek to establish an elite class of government leaders/officials who can impose whatever ideology,rules, restrictions they chose on the people on "the people".<br>  -->Obama HAS the desire and opportunity to use the "economy" to ram thru many changes that set this country on a path of socialism.<br>  Europe has succeeded in creating a minimally productive population that is both docile,dependent on the government for essential services and subsidies. Those who have acquired wealth are elevated into "the elite" as their income is needed by the Gov. who wants to be placed in a "class" as determined by the Gov ?<br>  This nation will indeed be "changed" because those that prefer to be self reliant,believe that determination ,work and desire can produce success will be stripped by government intervention,rules, controlled markets,businesses etc of their ability to stay self reliant or as our forefathers would say FREE.<br>  ..-> Obama thinks that gathering and taxing the population,it's businesses and anything that generates income (i.e. carbon tax) will produce "equity/parity "for all .THUS all the talk,desire and sneaky legislation not really explained  but SOLD as the "WAY' we in this US can achieve parity and help the poor oppressed needy folks who deserve more from "us". HIS DESIRE to "HELP" the oppressed/poor" etc applies to ALL THOSE suffering in the world  (some folks including his half brother live in poverty .

That redistribution has been greatly aided by Republican policies over the past few years and the result is a disastrous economy.

People who make more than $250,000 a year don't need that much & don't work harder than poor people. I am a professional organizer & I go into these huge houses & help people to find out what is valuable. It is hard to know what is valuable when you have too much.

This socialistic policy is just going to crumble every democratic foundation that we have. Capitalism has always brought prosperity. Socialism will just bring us equity and dependence on the government.<br>  <br>  Edit: And I come from a family of 14. I understand what it's like to not have a lot of money. But my parents worked hard to take care of us, and when I was old enough, all the money I made went to my parents so we could have a roof over our heads. Even though it was difficult to make ends meet sometimes, we would NEVER EVER want to take someone's hard earned money from them. They worked just as hard for their money as we did for ours. Therefore, they should keep what they make.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	Nope. That is a very socialist plan. 'Trickle UP economics?"<br>  <br>  No, if you want more money, earn more.

I6dcRgD6aa	from what we produce from it. If we have a nice country foreigners might come to see our beautiful country & spend money. So if they spend  billions a year here that will know down the debt. If we have our inventors invent things than that could bring in a couple billion a year. If we get people off of welfare & back to work that could bring in a few billion in savings & in them paying taxes. Just think with an open, intelligent mind. Instead of thinking negativily you could be working on the cure for diabetes that would bring in billions. There are so many ways but I am not the person to give you the amount of ways.

And when that doesn't produce enough money he will want more printed..  And we all know that works great!!!!   There needs to be a wake up call for all the obama followers.  If you spend money especially borrowed money it has to be paid back..  And well where o where do you think that will come from..  Your pockets and mine..

Also, what we need are tax cuts, not tax credits.  CUT taxes across the board, put more money back into the hands of the consumers.  Cut the capital gains tax.  Raising taxes is NEVER the answer to stimulate an economy.  Plus people seem to forget, that Obama has said he wants to raise taxes on those who make over $250,000/year.  Here's a problem I see with that, those who make over $250,000 a year are the job providers.  Many of which are small business owners, and if you raise their taxes, it makes it more difficult for them to provide jobs.|`|WvYw2xvdaa	Just wait, he isn't finished yet.

Guess not everyone learns from history. Nope sorry can't blame Bush for what is yet to come. It will be all Obama's doing with his massive spending.|`|pi5WKPNwaa	I feel that Obama really dose not care about how to pay for all of his spending.  I say that because it is fact that he has been President for less then 2 months and has already spent more then ALL previous Presidents COMBINED.  I think the real point is to advance the Socialist agenda that he believes in.  This country was founded based off of free enterprise.  Obama thinks that "Spreading the wealth around is good for everyone." The more people the government has on welfare the more power they have and the less rights we have. Paying for it is something that our grand children, great children a great great great grand children will have to figure out.|`|FIM2NKp0aa	You forget the big debt the former President left us, now we have to pay because he let everything get so far out of control.|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	By warming up the printing presses.<br>  Yes.

At least in the states the stars who create this glossy image are actually famous for something i.e. singing, acting etc. Here the bulk of the image you describe in your question is created by people who have just slept with someone famous or been on big brother.

I believe in God, but hate organized religion for some of the reasons you stated above. But if it's the "end times", then there is nothing that can be done from their perspective. The problem isn't with the religious in the U.S., the problem is with the crazies in Iran who do believe it is the end times and that they have to create the conditions necessary to bring back their prophet. That includes war. So, whether you believe in Revelations or not...Iran has their own agenda, and unfortunately, it trumps everything else right now. That is....if you can delve into common sense and see it.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	The pre trib rapture is a hoax created out of the Latter Rain movement, which morphed into the Charismatic Pentecostals just because you were duped by it does not mean Christianity is a farce.

No where in the Bible is the United States mentioned. (except maybe one place that talks about an eagle from the west.)  But when it comes to end times, we are not included.  Why?  Because all the action happens in the middle east.  There are some that believe saved christians will be raptured before the anti christ comes to power and some believe that the rapture will happen during the 7 years of tribulation. I for one, believe that we will be saved from having to endure that terrible time on earth.  Besides, we are taught in Revelation that the anti-christ will be of the roman empire descent.  Obama is not of that ethnicity.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	You don't believe in religion, therefore to debate in something that to you is simply make-believe raises the question of what motive do you have to engage this issue, other than to work out your past frustrations and issues you have with organized religion by lashing out at all religions in general.<br>  <br>  In other words, the anti-Christ is as real to you as the boogie man, do you regularly engage in conversations debating the timing and existence of him?  <br>  <br>  Since you are now so liberated and free of religious shackles, please utilize your abilities in productive areas that will reward you, and others, here on earth.  Your desire to argue issues you deem to be nonsense is keeping you held back by the very thing that you have fought to be free from.|`|I0OQoxVHaa	If you believe in the Antichrist, Obama can't be the Antichrist. According to the bible he can't be.  He doesn't look better than a normal person (The book of Revelations).  If he was, his time for taking this world and the "war" isn't close by.  Also just to let others know, I really dislike Obama.|`|aPtk8iEXaa	hmmm...sounds like your not reading from the same bible as I am..all the signs of the Anti are Obama...God said he would send us a false hope one that would bring peace and comfort to all nations, so your obama is the best candidate for this since their has never been anyone with so much glorification out their other than Jesus...even the Pope does not have as many followers as obama does now..you really think this world can go on much longer the way it is? your sadly mistaken if you do, but hey I have no worries I have not invested into Obamas hope or change.|`|AA10392074	i don't think you know revelations as well as you think you do... there is a 7 year period that the anti-christ is in power before the rapture...

Barack Obama is not the Anti-Christ<br>  <br>  -or-<br>  <br>  b.) the bible is wrong.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Actually, Revelations does not say whether the rapture occurs before or after the anti-Christ (which is why you have your pre and post tribulation denominations).<br>  <br>  If Obama is the anti-Christ then I guess the pre-tribulation believers are wrong.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	If you're trying to illustrate how the whole "anti-christ" thing is a childish excuse for intelligent discourse, mission accomplished.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Thanks for the anti-God rant.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, no thanks.<br>  <br>  Obummer wants to control your mind and body.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	How do you know they havent been already?

Obama has clearly inherited a tanking economy, and he's got 4 whole years for it to turn around.  It will in that time, regardless of any policies he implements.<br>  <br>  He can run around next election and ask, "Are you better off then you were 4 years ago?"  And the answer will be yes.  And he can claim that it's his policies that were responsible.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Maybe<br>  <br>  <br>  I guess some people forget that Bill Clinton was impeached.

HTitV7Plaa	They don't understand the science and they let their foolish religious fears dictate how they think.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	You do know that there is more than just embryonic stem cells, right? There are adult, bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, etc, stem cells, and there is no opposition to that research.<br>  <br>  Embryonic stem cells are collected by destroying an embryo, which is an early form of human life. Since many people believe that human life occurs at conception, it follows that they consider embryos to be human life.<br>  <br>  So, they consider it morally wrong to destroy an embryo for scientific research, and they consider it even more wrong to force them to pay taxes to support that destruction of human life.|`|4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	Thanks for calling us R-W-F you left wing fascist.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, every pharmaceutical Company has said that there is no value in Fetal stem cell Research.  The prefer Adult stem cells.  Your LWF Buddy Bill Clinton Had a total ban, Bush lifted that ban in defiance of the Christian block of his party and put a Federal ban of tax-payer money toward the research.<br>  <br>  California passed a 5 billion $ bond for Fetal and not one company took the money.  There is no value in that science.<br>  <br>  However the Left likes to use it as a wedge issue to justify murdering more unborn children.  I'm not even religious and I can see through that smoke SCREEN.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Your question betrays your ignorance.<br>  <br>  What is opposed is the illegal federal funding of this research.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	They're not.    They're against taxpayer funding of the creation of new human embryos for the purpose of killing them and harvesting their stem cells.<br>  <br>  Big difference.<br>  <br>  Drug companies and universities have private labs that were very well funded.   If they want to take private dollars and use them to fund the creation of embryos to kill them and harvest their stem cells for research, the "right wing fundies" never did anything to stop you.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to use taxpayer dollars to fund research using adult stem cells, the "right wing fundies" were in agreement.|`|QM2A6rBlaa	Because not everyone who is against it is a right wing fundimentalist. I am not, if anything I am moderate, however people like Linda B will never get it. <br>  <br>  there has not been one breakthrough in embryonic stem cell research, in the entire world, in many countries that don't have the restrictions the US does, whichj is the main argument by people who want it, in this country.<br>  <br>  Adult stem cell research has had quite a few break throughs, and viable cures are already undergoing FDA trials. All embryonic stem cell research has created are cells that mutate into disease or cancer.<br>  <br>  As stated by somebody else, most of the major drug companies do not even engage in it anymore because nothing good has come from it.<br>  <br>  thats why I am against it. Why not put that money into adult stem cell research, which is proven to at least get results?|`|xkcLOfTKaa	We are against creating humans to destroy in the name of "research".<br>  That is why Bush allowed federal funding of stem cell research for the 60 lines that already existed.<br>  <br>  I don't care what research is done, but I don't want MY tax dollars spent to intentionally destroy human life in the name of science...|`|yIyvNjZsaa	I think it's mainly to do with their religious beliefs and that the government has stepped over the "moral" line.<br>  <br>  I say, if it could help people and the research tools are available, why waste a good embryo?|`|CUVYxMF1aa	We aren't.

xxDjV6Axaa	Depends on the security of the facility, what crime they commited.<br>  <br>  A med security would have breakfast at 5:30-6am, lunch 10:30-11am, dinner 4:30-5pm.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, some can watch TV, they can read, draw if they can buy colored pencils and paper, write, sing, talk, walk around.  Prisoners are let out for recreation, jails usually aren't.  Long term inmates may be allowed to work inside or outside (if they have good behavior).<br>  <br>  They can take showers in jails every day if there is time.  Toilets are behind a short wall, not enclosed, so they are pretty much on display.  They can have soap, toothpaste, disposable razors, and deoderant in jail.  Prisoners can have more items.<br>  <br>  An infraction can lead to solitary, 23 hours a day in a cell.  Showers once or twice a week.  No a/c in a lot of them.<br>  <br>  It is very very boring so fights break out all the time. Phone calls are limited and there is jail system so each person only talks for a short time when it is their turn.<br>  <br>  In a jail dorm, there can be anywhere from 20-50 people.  Some have all beds side by side, some have bunkbeds.  The mattresses are very flat like exercise mats.  So are the pillows if they have them.  They get sheets and a blanket, one change of clothes at a time.  They are woken about 3am on laundry day to change their sheets and clothes.  They wear rubber sandals on their feet.<br>  <br>  They have visiting days usually 3 times a week, hours can vary.  They cannot touch the visitor and they are watched closely.  They are allowed to meet with their lawyers in private.  Smoking is not allowed but most allow it in the lawyer rooms.<br>  <br>  If they are sick, they have submit a written request to see the nurse.  Things like sore throats, coughs, headaches, will be ignored.  You must be bleeding heavily or lost a limb.  In prison, it is easier to see a nurse or doctor because they can be sued.  In jail, no one cares about you.<br>  <br>  I have visited many jails in my life (not as an inmate) and they are not pretty places.  Bars on windows, some don't even have glass you can see out of.  Lights stay on all the time.  The walls are the ugliest colors imaginable and paint is peeling off the cement.  It is either too cold or too hot.<br>  <br>  The inmates actually look forward to going to court because they have to leave at 4am to be transported, wait in a cell, see the judge, wait in a cell, and be transported back at about 5pm.  But at least they get to see the outside and breathe air for a little while.|`|a1pmr73vaa	DUI-2007<br>  sentence-40 days<br>  shared one small room with 2 bunks.<br>  5am shower<br>  6am change<br>  7am room cleaning<br>  8am breakfast<br>  9am free time<br>  10 am classes for those with longer sentences who take college in jail.<br>  11am room call<br>  12pm free time<br>  1pm free time<br>  2pm lunch and room call<br>  3pm visits<br>  4pm visits dp on which unit and whom has any! <br>  5pm room check/head count <br>  6pm outside time/free time<br>  7pm free time<br>  8pm free time<br>  9pm  bedtime.<br>  <br>  <br>  we are in our rooms 22hrs a day is hell and stinks and I lost alot of weight and the guards are pervs who watch us sometimes take the showers.<br>  they have a store where they sell TV'S.magazines and or you can sell your own stuff that ppl give to you too like a business thing.<br>  <br>  where I was it was UNIT so a group of 55 per unit and 3  or 5 per cell dp on over crowding too.<br>  I shared with lot of random ppl and some crack heads too and hookers..they we're the cool ones..but,the lesbain rape too so,I had to buy someone in jail to protect me from the beeouches...I made it out alive and drug free..I went to bible class and now..I will NEVER drive drunk crap!<br>  <br>  I had to pay a 1000 fine on top of all that and could not have sex so used a toothbrush.|`|c5416bdc0036767b0416972bf3475a2caa	Have your teachers schedule a tour and ask the officers and inmates your questions.|`|y42LEQL3aa	LOTS AND LOTS OF ANAL RAPE

Normally, i would tell you right here and now you weren't excepted for the job b/c you lied.  I will have to call you back and speak to my HR dept and the higher-ups."

The only pre-requisite is common sense and a grasp of what's right and wrong.   Unfortunately, Democrats are lacking in both of these attributes.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	The outstanding difference between the mind set and political ideals of the Republican and that of the Democrat is that the Republican tends to put forth the ideal that all things are earned and nothing is owed. The Republican Party holds the mindset that anything can be achieved but nothing is given. This mindset is seen most often in the party's push for equal tax rates despite income, as well as minimized social assistance programs. This is fought for in an attempt to treat all citizens equally despite income, race, sex, or religion. Meanwhile Democrats seek to raise taxes so that government can provide services such as health insurance and housing assistance to everyone. Republicans wish to minimize these socialist ideals, because of the modern failure of governments that attempted to invoke them. Republicans also show concerns about having big government in charge of such vital issues as food, shelter, or health care, as they believe the private sector and/or the individual are better suited to control their own lives. The much revered president Ronald Reagan was a Republican and has been quoted as saying "Government is not the solution, it is the problem." <br>  <br>  I know it doesn't really answer your question, but if you think about people who don't believe in Republican ideals, we are the other people.

Just don't threaten someone you know and don't make details.<br>  <br>  Threats are always best vague...|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	If the guy takes it as a serious threat and reports it he can get in trouble. Your friend needs to be careful what he says there because keyboards are impersonal and things like "im gonna beat you down!" on a game can be taken the wrong way or posted somewhere else to look like a threat (kind of like being set up) so just be careful where you post and what you post, as cyber bullying is illegal and you can get into big trouble. It can also be a problem if it gets serious enough that he used your computer to make the threat, it is just an I.P. Address that is tracked and it can look like it came from you due to it being your internet service, looking like something you wrote.|`|ryjnt3dhaa	I think only if he personally knew the guy and there was any way of the threat being carried out.

That is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters before the week you file an initial claim application for a new benefit year. The wages paid during this period of time are used to determine if you have enough wages to qualify for a claim and to calculate how much you can be paid. <br>  <br>  There is an excellent explanation of this for Wisconsin here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/uiben/computing_benefit_entitlement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/uiben/computi...</a>|`|htSZsds7aa	I thought it was 18 months

HpJ4wwC7aa	You have to go to four years of undergraduate school which can get you into whatever debt it costs you to complete it, and you would generally need A's and B's in undergraduate school to get accepted into law school. Once you graduate with your good grades, you have to get a good score on the LSAT, which would generally be a 155 or higher. Law school is generally another three years, and the tuition is more expensive than most undergraduate schools. If you get scholarships, then that would help, but you also have to add in living expenses so it could be anywhere from $30k to $50k per year to go to law school. While in law school, you should take some family law-related courses and then once you graduate and pass the bar, you can work at a family law firm or start your own business. <br>  <br>  I should warn you though, that family law is very litigious, and the clients are sometimes quite a handful. <br>  <br>  I worked at a small general practice law office on and off through college and I can tell you that criminal clients were generally more pleasant to work with than divorce/custody clients. I believe it is because of the strong emotional element involved. Many clients were amicable and nice to work with, but several were very vengeful and didn't care as much about settling and cared more about making their ex miserable. Really sad, especially when kids were involved. Good luck though. I can tell you work was always interesting at least. Some clients' cases were almost soap opera material - even though that shouldn't be an incentive.
CwNMq7RTaa	When I took a pre-law course in college, one of my assignments was helping people appeal denials of unemployment compensation.  I actually handled their cases under the direction of lawyers who were teachers.  I prepared all the documentation and evidence and accompanied them to their appeals hearings.  Out of 7 cases, we won at 6 of them.  So I know what I'm talking about.  If you tell the truth and if you can back it up with credible evidence, you can win.  Even if you sent that letter.  Just tell the hearing examiner why you did it.  If you can compile any proof of your layoff or of a pattern of layoffs at that company generally, it will help.  You might call a local law school if there is one and ask if there is a student who could help you.  If you present a good case, you have a good shot a winning.  Good luck.|`|yIyvNjZsaa	If he can produce a signed (by you) letter of resignition, then there is nothing you can do.  If you didn't sign one of these, then there is nothing he can do.  One of these should be provided to EDD by the employer if you quit.<br>  <br>  If your letter simply (even arrogantly) states that you have found a new position, it won't help out your former employer.|`|K2ecmzInaa	Do you deserve it? Can't answer that. No one really deserves being laid off.<br>  <br>  But if you sent around a letter saying you were hired elsewhere and your boss is claiming you quit, yeah it seems as if you are lying. Chances are you shot yourself in the foot. Your best bet is to be completely honest with unemployment. <br>  <br>  But, I did hope you learned your lesson. Be careful what you put in writing.|`|3CxtflUsaa	That letter is going to hurt you. <br>  <br>  You would need a witness to this conversation you had with him where he tells you it is a layoff. If you don't have one, then I would say your chances are rather slim for a win in your favor. <br>  <br>  Also, if he has done this in the past, you could show a pattern of him lying but again, you'd need another person to validate your claim.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|011830a2652ee7687c383f5f54db2d13aa	Depending on the wording in your letter, it could also work as evidence of your lay off.  Again, it depends on what you wrote.<br>  <br>  Look for work.  Mitigating (attempting to ease the burden your own situation) will be a good start..|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	You will have a chance to appeal the decision.  Follow through with it.  The ED is very heavily sided with the unemployed.|`|AA11974929	What injustice? Presumably, the global financial meltdown was not news to you. It should have triggered an inquiry on your part to determine whether you might be laid off, when and what UE requirements were. Unlike the boy scouts, you were not prepared. That's the bad news.<br>  <br>  The good news is that if you're willing to eat some humble pie and tell the truth about your arrogant letter to team, you may be able to get a letter from boss that covers you. Call him up and explain your circs, admit the letter to team was motivated by shock, grief and shame - the usual things people feel when we're axed - and ask he'd prepare a letter or sign the one you've prepared in advance, outlining the circs of your lay-off. Certainly, if you had not 'agreed' orally to leave, you would have been formally dismissed. Keep the letter for his signature brief - no more than a page - and you'll probably get what you want. Again, humility is the key here. DO NOT spout about injustice. You were the author of your own misfortune. Own it and start reading the boy scouts' manual. You'll need the advice as we all do in your upcoming job search.|`|m0dntUuwaa	In all honesty, maybe the letter wasnt such a bright idea, and if your former boss has a copy of that letter, you really don't have much of a case. HOWEVER, if he does not have evidence of the letter, it is your word against his. it's one thing if you have no evidence, but EDD is going to be sketchy if your former employer has no evidence either. Bottom line is, you were laid off, and how can you QUIT from a job that you've already been let go from? While I wouldnt have sent out a letter, you did what any other person would do if they got fired or laid off. If you explain in detail everything that happened from that meeting with your former boss, you might have a chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am going through this situation as well, my former employer lied on me as well, but she has no proof, and I do. As soon as I get my hearing date, I'm pulling out all the stops on my former boss :)|`|rIn1K8hUaa	All you can do is tell the truth at the hearing. Most of the time the employer does not even show up for the hearing. The officer will have to decide who is telling the truth. But you can always ask if any other people have been let go before and after you. This will help validify your situation if he has had any other lay offs. Also if you havent drawn a paycheck from anywhere else you should be OK.|`|m6GveN68aa	have they already rejected your claim?<br>  <br>  stupid move with the letter though. what else did your letter say?  and why wold you send it to the whole team?  dumb, dumb, dumb.|`|AA11206283	uh...it's he said, she said. <br>  <br>  Present the facts, hope he has a history of being a troubled employer, present a clean work record, proof of his financial problems, and jobhunt,|`|525m5qrTaa	File an appeal and take it to an arbitrator...

In Illinois all leases must have an end date and can not automatically continue.  Put in writing that you will not be renewing, contact the state department of professional regulation for your state and talk to someone there.  They may have an office of Real Estate or some other similar name.  Contact them.  There are a lot of free lawyers geared toward real estate as well though take a look at your security deposit and call the state to find out what your laws are.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	That really stinks!  They are within their legal bounds but certainly not ethically.  However, they can only charge you for 3 months or until the apt is rented, whichever is less.  I have known of people who printed flyers advertising their own apt and had it rented before they moved out.  Not a sublet, they just showed it and then told people to go to the rental office.  This could work unless you have a lot of open units.|`|7qxqkjNhaa	Tell them your breaking your Lease as of today and will be leaving on June 1.

They want 60 days notice, but you do not have to give it.  30 days notice.  UNLESS in your original lease your signed it says you have to give them 60 days notice.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	You need to read the lease agreement. Does it say 60 days? If less than that what can be done...prorated rent for that month? Read it dude!|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	Generally, in year to year leases, they can do that. But do you get to at least live there for the three months? Some of the year to year leases require even more of a notice than 60 days to decide whether to renew or not. You should have read your lease agreement when you initially signed up for it. It should have said that in the agreement. If there wasn't an agreement that said 60 days in there, then general common law states that you have to give as much notice as what half the periodic tenancy lease signs you up for. Sometimes different states have different statutory notice requirements but if your state goes by common law and it wasn't in the lease agreement, a year to year lease generally requires 6 months notice to terminate a lease. Maybe you can negotiate, especially if you can't afford it. I mean, they need money and they can't get money out of someone who doesn't have any money, and they would probably rather rent it to someone who actually has the money to pay instead of having to be a debt collector to you.<br>  <br>  Also, if they (or you even) can find someone who can rent the place for those three months, they have a general mitigating duty to rent it to them in good faith. Assuming that the other renter passes all the credit and background checks and is eligible to rent from them.

ABmZYbDZaa	Not trying to be mean but working late, not always being able to come home by 5, having to stay all night sometimes and having to be in the field for sometimes days on end is part of being in the Army. You and he both need to learn to deal with it and learn to work with each other to deal with the schedule that the Army gives him. <br>  <br>  If the unit he is in is getting ready to deploy there is a ton of things that must be done before that can happen. There will be a lot of late nights for a little while, a lot of field time, range time and time at the unit doing briefings and other training. Once they are ready to go things will slow down and he will have time off before he actually goes on deployment. So don't panic he WILL get time with you and your child before he goes on deployment. He just needs to get prepared and get trained before he goes over there eso he comes home in one piece and is safe while he is there. <br>  <br>  In all honestly there is nothing the Chaplain can do because this is typical of being in the Army. Him being away a lot is not abnormal, it does NOT mean that something is going on behind your back and it does NOT mean that he has an alliterative motive/hidden agenda . <br>  <br>  In 17 years of being a wife I have lost count of the holidays, special occasions and events my husband has missed due to work. There have been many, many times that we;'ve had to change our plans at the last minute because he's had to stay late or go back in due to issues at the unit.

Move on and fight battles you can win.<br>  <br>  <br>  and Obama believes in saving lives through other measures;  he overturned a ban on stem cell research.  and he's withdrawling troops from Iraq.|`|AfaFCiKxaa	Are you taking into account that even the woman who just had octuplets had many more embryos created in the fertility clinic than she could have implanted.  What will happen to them?<br>  <br>  If you were one of those embryos would you rather be thrown out or used to help cure illness?<br>  <br>  These embryos are far from babies.  They are only a few cells, and while they could become babies if they were implanted, the ones being used for stem cell research would never have been implanted.  They would have been thrown out.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	he's "murdering" blobs. literally, they're just blobs! Are you happy that you voted for a man whose vice president couldn't name a magazine she reads or a Supreme court case she disagrees with and who thinks Africa is a country?|`|CSbSQfYHaa	You are assuming that the embryos qualify as human beings rather than as extensions of the woman's body. Please spare me the theatrics. <br>  <br>  And yes, I am very proud to have voted for Obama.|`|fDuCamMraa	I'm very proud that I didn't. He has proven everything I thought about him true. He is ten times the embarrassment that Bush was and much more destructive to America. And Bush was far from my favorite!|`|3YRrGfkiaa	I don't care about abortion.  It's an irrelevant issue.<br>  <br>  Yes, I'm proud that I voted him in.|`|57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	Proud that I DIDNT!|`|a6k5WZxGaa	yeah|`|LcAiHBsaaa	Even after that video, I am still dang proud I voted for him.  The video doesn't phase me, and is obviously biased so I think the video is CRAP.<br>  <br>  Like I have said before and will continue to say... the people who want abortion to be outlawed are the same ones that don't want to help the mother take care of the child when the father leaves and she can't make ends meet.  You can't judge someone on their personal beliefs and how they choose to handle their business.  You can't force someone to carry a child to term and then force them to take care of it... just as someone can't force you to raise your children a certain way.<br>  <br>  WHO are YOU to tell someone what they think is RIGHT or WRONG?<br>  <br>  You are no one.  I proudly effin' support a woman's right to choose and always will.  Next please.|`|Wx1PqjgBaa	Since when do atheists shill for the "Priests For Life?"  I suppose you are proud of the catholic church for excommunicating the family of a 9 year old Brazilian child for terminating the pregnancy after she was raped by her stepfather.|`|KMeUXNq3aa	If I voted for that galoot, I would even be ashamed to admit it while hiding behind my computer teleprompter.Oops, I meant computer screen.|`|HMNvFBr5aa	Who says I voted for him. ;)<br>  I personally dislike him.<br>  He is a socialist and isn't right for America.
KLt8LAoaaa	Check out this wiki page on the Connecticut Compromise (aka great compromise) which answers the question pretty thoroughly:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut...</a><br>  <br>  FTA: "It proposed a bicameral legislature, resulting in the current United States Senate and House of Representatives."<br>  "...forged a compromise for a bicameral, or two-part, legislature consisting of a lower and upper house".
iAMQiCbhaa	We dissolve the Large evil companys and take the money the employer & employee pay and start a universal plan.  Then we make sure we switch to prevention instead of treatment.  Anyone with a S.S.# gets coverage. And all will be worked out in the end. By the way I have VERY VERY GOOD health insurance, so I don't have my hand out, the double standard makes me sick.|`|AA10079277	Well at least even today no one can be denied care.|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	People need to depend on themselves for everything and not the government.<br>  <br>  How about this idea America?  It worked for me and it can work for you.<br>  <br>  Go to high school and get good grades.<br>  <br>  Go to college and get a decent education.  Work your hiney off to pay to get a higher education if you weren't born rich.<br>  <br>  Get a decent job that offers healthcare coverage.<br>  <br>  Don't even think about having a baby until you have a career, a roof over your head, and and spouse!|`|iJMRmrY3aa	Before doing anything else:<br>  <br>  The Federal government should make health insurance premiums 100% tax-deductible for people.  Then spend some money on PSAs that notify people of the tax-benefit, and wait to see how people respond.<br>  <br>  My guess is that people would buy health insurance in droves.  And we would be left with a much smaller problem. <br>  <br>  Look how effective the mortgage interest deduction has been!|`|52cGZS3caa	We should have our own brand of universal health care, not like Canada or Europe. Anyone who thinks otherwise never had to watch a family member die from lack of medical care due to the cost/unavailability of good insurance.|`|lJGnuMbbaa	make everyone in the USA illegal then we will get free health care. with out waiting for gov. permission to see a doctor or have our medical record in gov. computers
pcHp7Dgkaa	There's no luck involved and if you qualify on all fronts, you should eventually get a visa (unless the rules change of course) but when that will be all depends on your occupation.<br>  <br>  Right now, if your job is on the Critical Skills List, you would get a Case Officer before the end of May. It doesn't take long after that.<br>  <br>  If your job is on the MODL, allocation to Case Officers isn't happening at present, but should begin within the next few months (probably May/June) and then it will be done in order of lodgement. Anyone lodging now will have a long wait for the backlog in front of them to be cleared.<br>  <br>  People with jobs only on the SOL have a VERY long wait ahead of them - probably several years.<br>  <br>  If you want to jump the queue, try for state government sponsorship. That takes priority over everything.
eIZw7EXCaa	The US Constitution, perhaps?<br>  <br>  The only constitutional punishment for a president is impeachment; only while still in office can a president be impeached; the only penalty is removal from office.<br>  <br>  "Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.<br>  "|`|rxQt7auLaa	Which war crimes were those?<br>  <br>  The Iraq war that was actually enacted by Congress?<br>  The illegal wiretaps that were actually made legal by Congress?  (Obama voted for them, you know)<br>  The awarding of defense contracts to defense contractors as allowed under the Federal Acquisition Regulations?<br>  <br>  I think that first you have to commit a crime before you can be punished.  Just disagreeing is not sufficient cause to bring charges.<br>  <br>  And, if you want to talk about civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, remember to include Obama for anyone that died after Jan 20, 2009.|`|0hncNSXlaa	lmao to some of these answears Iraq war was illegal because the U.N. wasnt for it um please read the constitution congress declares war and they dont have to get it aproved by the U.N. in fact the U.S. doesn't have to answear to the U.N. at all we are a sovergn nation or did you forget as fot war crimes please inform me what he did wrong and how many terrorists you know signed the geneva conventions oh and last i checked the people bush went after (sadam, osama) much bigger war crimonals unless you want to be friends with guys who condone mass murder of there own populus or flying jets into buildings killing thousands of unarmed people|`|AA11813034	because the new administration is the same as the old administration, they have NO desire to go after Bush. and every admin. will be the same in the future until the people wake up and realizethat  the only "change" that ever  occurs is the rhetoric. the results are always the same, more war, less freedom for the people, bigger government....................|`|Gx1ewGOFaa	"Well, when the president does it that means that it is not illegal." - Richard M. Nixon<br>  <br>  The President can get away with a hell of a lot. If there is any investigation of Bush, it won't be until the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are over. For all those claiming that he did nothing wrong, I'd like to point out that technically Iraq was illegal, as it did not receive United Nations support.<br>  <br>  If some tiny country had done that, I'm sure they would've got into trouble from the UN. But unfortunately double standards exist for the US. In addition, I imagine that Bush covered his tracks pretty well and it'll all get brushed under the carpet.<br>  <br>  The problem is that a lot of things that Bush potentially did are labelled 'conspiracy theories'. 9/11, the rigging of the '00 & '04 elections - it's very hard to get anyone in authority to truly question these things.|`|m24wuDzwaa	I don't know but they should.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	Praise the lord  oh Jesus oh lord please help me. Stupid questions get stupid answers thanx for the 2 points|`|nhWTN3uhaa	Okay Badar B.  I'm going to do you a life lesson favor.  If there was a case against Bush don't you think the radical nut jobs in charge of our government would be all over this issue?  Instead the most left wing leaders in American History are doing nothing about Bush and his "Horrible crimes" If anyone was going to pursue putting Bush in jail it would be these guys right?  So they are not pursuing it.  It pisses you off I get that.  Now please put two and two together.<br>  <br>  Okay so now we have established they have no case, correct!  Why do you think the liberal nut jobs lied to you?  This is going to be hard for you to deal with but really try and think why you were lied to?  When they told you Bush broke the law did it piss you off?  DId it make you made at him, did you want to get him out of office because of it?  Did you no longer believe Bush when he spoke on any other issue?<br>  <br>  If you are following me it should be clear by now that you were lied too so that the dems could get elected into office.  How many other things do you think you they lied to you about?  How about Obama is not a liberal?  How about Obama is not a socialist?  How about Obama will not sign any bills on his desk that have ear marks?  How about Obama will put all bills on the internet and allow 100% transparency and not rush legislation.  How about Obama will not sell out Israel?  How about Obama will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons?  I've got to go back to work so I need to stop the list now.<br>  <br>  I hope you got the idea.  If democrats tell voters the truth then they can't get elected.  So they must lie.  Do republicans ever lie.  Sure they do.  George Bush Sr. said read my lips no new taxes.  Do you remember what happened to him after he lied to the republcians?  We ended up with a third party candidate and Bill Clinton was elected with only 40% of the vote.<br>  <br>  So when republicans lie, they get punished by republicans.  When dems lie republicans try and hold them accountable but we can't really only the democrats that voted for him can do that.<br>  <br>  So what should now that you are angry for being played a fool?  I say tell all your friends to campaign for republicans in the next elections in 2 years.  If we can turn back the house and senate to the republican party we can limit the damage done by voters like you that believed the lies.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Fool you once shame on them fool you twice shame on you.|`|5212e090d6f32af9642db85d424eef01aa	one of the laws he made up while he had his rubber stamp congress is that he and his cronies could not be prosecuted for war crimes in the US.

Gx1ewGOFaa	Look at the whole of the 20th century!<br>  <br>  A large part of the world took on Marx's ideas (albeit in part, don't say that the Soviet Union or China are Marxist, whatever you do!) of redistribution of wealth, historical materialism, and the notion of revolution as an everyday part of life.<br>  <br>  How Marx's idea will affect the future, however? Who knows? But with the recession being in part (or in its entirety even?) caused by selfish, ruthless capitalism, his ideas are just as relevant today as they were 100 years ago.|`|jQXza1aSaa	Karl Marx was a visionary who had an idea for a great future of mankind. His ideas were to have people work together for the common good of the people and the country, instead of having them fight each other for the "breadcrumbs" of the rich. Communism strives for equal rights of people and equal opportunities for them as well.<br>  <br>  Hopefully America will see the problems with Capitalism and strive towards this better system.|`|hXwqKidraa	Capitalism has to fail before any of his ideas are put into effect.<br>  That's the problem.
