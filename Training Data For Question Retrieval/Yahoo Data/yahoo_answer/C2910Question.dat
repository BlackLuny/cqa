20090203113451AAUE6Jz	Environment;Global Warming	Does so-called "global cooling" happen once every decade?	Certain individuals like to argue that global warming has stopped because there has been a (statistically insignificant) cooling trend in average global temperatures over the past 7 years or so.      However, over the past 150 years this same argument could have been made 15 times, once per decade on average (see link below).      And yet over that period, the planet has warmed nearly 1Â°C. So what's the deal with this "global warming has stopped" every decade argument?

They don't have any groups at my University and I was wondering if there was a big one for the environment, kind of how PETA is with animal rights (only not how insane PETA is haha). I already do lots of stuff to help out the environment, so how can I get more involved?

20090219180803AAqaGxN	Environment;Global Warming	What is the appropriate density of Mountain Ash (Southern Australia) per hectare?	A good estimate was 30 + trees per hectare. Plant (maintain) the saplings at roughly twice that and the problems with water use and and fuel can go away. In addition the trees can still produce fresh leaf tips even in drought, and maintain an optimum growth rate.   Know why we don't do this?

Im just interested what other people think and why you think teens smoke and I just need some op ions on the things I have done and a place to vent. I know i smoked my first cigarette when i was 13 because I always had allot of stress at home and all my friends smoked but they never tried to pressure me into smoking i was just fighting with my mom before school one day and when I got to school i walked to the alley were we all stood before school and grabbed a cigarette out my friends hand and started smoking it. I never got along with my mom and i idolized my brother who smoked and i wanted to do everything he did. My brother did every thing to try to get me to stop smoking he tried quieting but he couldn't he smoke since he was 16 he wouldn't smoke in front of my or leave his cigarettes where i could find them. I still idolize my brother because hes gone threw allot of tuff sh*t and his 2 friends that i have know since i was little and they are like brothers to me. When I turned 14 my brother started buying my cigarettes because I would get them from friends and other people and he didn't want me to get caught getting them off of other people. I tried smoking weed 2 times but it wasn't for me. I've drank before but its always with my brother and his friends at one of there houses or in my basement and they all hate to see me smoke or drink but they say they'd rather me do it with them so I don't do anything stupid or get into anything else. Im 17 and still smoke and every time I light up a cig the say they hate them self's for supporting my habit. I know its bad and I wish i would have never done it but the way i look at it is that threes Alto of worse things i could do.
