0wUwKbHsaa	Not sure why they did that but man that does not sound like good database design specifically for the troubles you are having.  You likely need to use dynamic SQL within a stored procedure (no way to do this in a select statement as far as I know).  However, if you have any programming ability on the SQL query side, it would be best to do it there instead of trying to do it in the select statement.  In other words, generally you submit a built SQL statement from a language outside of the database.  You can build the SQL statement any way you want.<br>  <br>  So either you need to program it on the client side (where you build your SQL statement) or you need to insert a stored procedure.|`|hPirjSKsaa	Interesting question.  I'll bet you want to strangle the person that designed the database this way.<br>  <br>  The only way I could think of to solve this problem is to either create a script or a stored procedure that would construct a query using the correct field names given the current month.|`|sbEf639waa	Create view on the base table with the names you need.

If you typically use a notebook computer with SVGA resolution, you will want a plasma tv with the same native SVGA resolution in order to get the sharpest and cleanest image. Similarly, if you normally use a computer with XGA output, you will get the best picture from a plasma that has XGA as its native resolution. <br>  <br>  Most of the plasma tvs on the market today are capable of projecting input signals other than their native resolutions. For example, you can usually hook up an XGA computer to an SVGA plasma. The plasma tv will automatically convert the incoming 1,024 x 768 signal to its native 800 x 600 output. However, there is always a loss of sharpness and detail in the process, so you will end up with a picture that is not quite as sharp as if the incoming signal had been the same format as the plasma tvs native resolution. <br>  <br>  This loss of sharpness also happens if you plug an SVGA computer into a higher-resolution XGA plasma tv. You will usually get a decent image, but the conversion from the 800 x 600 input to a 1,024 x 768 output will produce some fuzziness that you may not appreciate after having spent the money for an XGA plasam tv. <br>  <br>  The plasma tv’s process of converting a different input format to its native output format is called "scaling." Some plasma screen tvs are very good at scaling, so the resulting image fuzziness is relatively minor, and the image is very adequate no matter what the source. The quality of scaling varies widely among plasma tvs and like all technology, it is constantly being improved. If scaling is an important consideration, be sure you see it demonstrated as you would use it.|`|RCIr3Wnjaa	yes if your computer has hdmi output and the tv has hdmi input or<br>  vga output on pc and vga input on tv or dvi output on pc and dvi input on tv|`|3Les3n24aa	No, Computer monitors have a higher refresh rate than TVs of any kind.<br>  <br>  It will work if you have the right inputs but it will not be as effecive.

zorYTX59aa	It's very important to understand that there's a big difference between<br>  "no longer available" and "unavailable". They're 2 completely different<br>  messages that result from 2 different situations. "No longer available"<br>  is usually the byproduct of either a computer software conflict and/or<br>  YouTube problems with Firefox 3. If your message says "unavailable", <br>  please read below:<br>  <br>  People all over the planet are uploading videos <br>  to YouTube virtually every second of every day<br>  (13 hours' worth every minute according to the<br>  YouTube blog of November 12, 2008).<br>  <br>  Because everyone is uploading different types<br>  of videos (like AVI, MOV, MPG, WMV, etc) in<br>  different lengths using different compressions,<br>  YouTube says it can take 8 hours before your <br>  video is "processed". However....<br>  <br>  Even if your video has successfully "uploaded"<br>  and "processed", YouTube's servers must still<br>  "database", "index", and "categorize" your vid, <br>  such that any computer around the planet can<br>  then access and watch your video. This whole<br>  other "processing" sometimes take days, and<br>  explains why you may get one of the following:<br>  -- your video still doesn't appear in My Videos;<br>  -- your video is indeed there, but no thumbnail;<br>  -- your thumbnail is there with all the video info, it is "live" and "public"<br>  but when you click it, you get the message "this video is unavailable";<br>  but when you click it, you see the message "this video is unavailable";<br>  -- your video is on your profile page but does not appear in YouTube's <br>  search results, even if you type in your video title and your username.<br>  <br>  Like I said, the entire process can sometimes <br>  take several days. How long has it really been <br>  since YouTube received your video?<br>  <br>  Once your video finally is in the public domain,<br>  there is the strange possibility that YouTube's<br>  computer algorithms have yet to figure out the<br>  20 videos which should appear in the "Related <br>  Videos" section. Don't be surprised if that part<br>  doesn't show anything right away and is blank.<br>  <br>  I hope that my answer was a little helpful for U.<br>  <br>  (If your upload has indeed finished processing<br>  and is "Live" but "unavailable", it's conceivable<br>  that there is something potentially awkward in <br>  your video title, its description or its tags. The<br>  apparent solution to that is to edit them.

SNBG0Y5eaa	Powerpoints are for slideshow presentations, so that won't work at all.<br>  <br>  You can create a leaflet document in Word, but you will have to do it manually. Set the page layout to landscape, and create a single row, 3 column table that spans the entire page 1 and 2. <br>  <br>  If you have both Word and Powerpoint, I'll guess that you have the MS Office Suite. If so, the best application to use for this purpose is Publisher. It has all sorts of layout for brochures and and other layout formats already predefined, such as a 3-panel leaflet.

qoieJBQHaa	Im not 100% but i think the cells can only show a certain amount of text. <br>  <br>  If you're writing loads of text,  have you thought about using a table in word instead?|`|g62ATenqaa	There is only so much that you can get into one cell, even using wordwrap. You would be better off using merged cells, rather than wordwrap if you are inputting lengthy amounts of text into a cell. Excel, although obviously you can input text, is mainly for the calculation of figures so if you have a large amount of text, I suggest you insert it either into a text box or as a comment. This would help keep the cell structure neater.|`|Cb6BheBgaa	Have you tried increasing the column width?|`|vTf1ghlwaa	You have probably hit the limit for a single cell use merge and centre to put your writing over a few cells

gdzLn3FVaa	There is a way but it's alot of work going through safemode so the program doesn't start go to msconfig check what programs not suppose to be there go to regedit delete entrys.  Which is as you can see alot of work.  So, I suggest going through yahoo search download and buy stopzilla.  It's a adwarez and popup virus eliminator.  This program is one of the best I've used just one click scan it will remove all unwanted program that installed on your PC without clean installing you system. You'll see how fast your PC will run after the scan and one thing you won't loose all your important files and music. :)|`|CSDlp4Igaa	you could try resetting it from the bios..<br>  i would suggest just taking it to a computer shop, that would be a lot easier.|`|DjGEJfaPaa	You just need to reformat your computer. Simply insert your Windows Installation disc and reboot the computer to begin installing Windows.<br>  <br>  This of course will wipe your hard drive. Make sure you back up your music first. There are some great deals on external hard drives on newegg.com. Good luck!|`|XXLOMOjeaa	Absolutely, there are several very easy ways to delete everything on the hard drive, but this will of course erase everything. <br>  <br>  You would need to go into your boot menu and boot from a CD. The Windows Installation CD would be the best one. It would be pretty involved to explain how to install Windows, but it's not too bad if you have the CD and can read. <br>  <br>  You should not have to buy another copy of Windows to get it back up and running, but from all your questions it would probably be faster and easier for you to take it to a computer shop. Tell them what you want saved and have them back it up and reinstall Windows for you.

qXQa06bAaa	Facebook, as it seems the most stable & reliable (and there's currently more people on there) + it has the best privacy controls, but isn't as customisable (which at least keeps everything easy to read).<br>  <br>  MySpace is a bit more reliable than it was, but if one of your friends deletes their account, messages from them you saved in your messages folder get deleted too (with facebook, they remain there, but the link to their account is deactivated)...... also I've been having trouble persuading the current version of their photo uploader to work (a rip-off of Facebook's)<br>  <br>  Bebo is just plain annoying, as all I ever get on their is idiots I don't even know posting sh***y spam messages via mobile onto my comments board (despite BEBO's best efforts to put in ways to stop it) + they don't give you any say in your username, e.g. I nearly always choose "jduck1979" as my username on most sites.... but on BEBO they gave me "JohnD92495" whether I liked it or not, though they seem to have fixed that now.<br>  <br>  There's also a few others such as<br>  - FUBAR<br>  <a href="http://www.fubar.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fubar.com</a><br>  Which I have mixed thoughts on<br>  <br>  &<br>  - Friendster<br>  <a href="http://www.friendster.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.friendster.com</a><br>  Which I don't think that much of 'cos their profiles are a bit weakly designed + I been having troubles going to my profile a few times recently due to one of their adverts re-directing to a stupid rogue anti-spyware scan.<br>  <br>  & also "Yuwie"<br>  <a href="http://r.yuwie.com/jduck1979" rel="nofollow">http://r.yuwie.com/jduck1979</a><br>  (which is like MySpace + Bebo, except they pay you for stuff).|`|3qRgXu3vaa	Facebook<br>  Easier to communicate with friends <br>  Easier to find friends <br>  And generally much better|`|6jW5L3Vqaa	Facebook! ;)|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Bebo, i just can't get the hang of facebook!|`|5u8TaKnQaa	Just use all three.|`|QZ6rFItqaa	Well it used to be bebo but know its all about Facebook!!!|`|PjlhgQ3uaa	i think bebo because it is shorter to type the adress into :P

wGjvx0Z9aa	You can't.  That's the downside of 2.0.  You can still make all your internal features private (blog, pictures, etc.), but all the info in your profile's tables can still be seen.|`|V5CRGK86aa	I had the same problem. When you hit the "customize profile" under the edit profile, it will take you to the screen where you choose your 2.0 layout. From there, you place your mouse over each box. For example, when you roll your mouse over "about me" it will give you the chance to edit that information. You will see a box that will say something like, "who can see this info" and it will give you 3 boxes to check. 1 box is everyone, the second is my friends only, and the third is no one. Unfortunately with profile 2.0, you have to edit every info box individually to make your info private. If you'd like, visit my page at myspace.com/avaohio   you will see what people who are not on your friends list will see when you edit each section of your profile to "my friends only".

Grab a ten dollar tower at a garage sale, and put two 128's in there. Also uninstall any programs you do not use.

I had told them and even sent them very detailed instructions on how to speed up their computers, but they went for finally fast dot com anyway. So after spending hundreds of dollars and having a computer way slower than it was before, they came back to me. I had to finally do a full recovery of the systems to take off all the crap that finally fast put on it and to rid it of the spyware and malware that the same site placed on it. They lost everything on the systems to the recovery, with the exception of the ones that were smart enough to back up all photos and files that they wanted to keep. This is my advice to you. Back up your files to cd/dvd rom or flash drive(s) and do a full recovery. The down side is that you will lose all of your installed software, the upside is that your system will be as it was out of the box and any spyware, malware or viruses will be eliminated when the drive is formatted. Your computer will be minus all of the crap that builds up over time and will be fast again. I recommend a full recovery twice per year. just be sure to defrag the drive as soon as the recovery is finished. Also, invest in a good external hard drive. When installing software or saving files use the external drive for this and in the future you can recover your system and never have to loose anything. Good luck to you.

fE7zhp3Caa	You can create a MIDI file using a program called a MIDI sequencer or another type of program called a tracker provided it's configured for MIDI rather than digital audio.  Anymore MIDI sequencers are part of larger, more complicated programs called digital audio workstations (DAW), which allow a musician to combine MIDI and digital audio for more complex mixes.<br>  <br>  MIDI itself is actually a very simple language used between MIDI-enabled musical devices.  The MIDI data is pretty basic, containing only pitch, velocity (essentially volume), channel, and program/soundbank information.  It was originally intended for allowing a single musician to connect several MIDI instruments together and play all of them together by only controlling one.<br>  <br>  Adding a MIDI-enabled computer to the mix extends possibilities almost infinitely.  Newer digital audio technologies allow the use of software synthesizers (soft synths) in place of or in addition to the more expensive hardware synthesizers (hard synths).  The two big soft synth technologies for PC are VST (Steinberg's Virtual Studio Technology) and Microsoft's DirectX (for Mac you have Audio Units and VSTs).  Both include software instruments and audio effects (like reverb, delay, flange, distortion, etc.).  You can also get MIDI effects like arpeggiators and transposers, but those only work on the MIDI data.<br>  <br>  To check out a good, not-quite-free sequencer, I'd recommend grabbing Reaper.  You can download it and see how MIDI sequencing is done on PC.  You'll need to grab some VST instruments if you want to hear more than your soundcard's General MIDI soundbank, though.|`|FA3OvOkcaa	A variety of programs can be used to create midi files, most of them are shareware/demos. I believe the freeware program Modplug Tracker can import and export midi files. On their website (Sourceforge) they have tutorials.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|PI39uwZDaa	MIDI music files are created by electronic  sound instruments when connected to a computer. It does not contain any kind of speech as like a normal MP3 sound file. It is a standard to define the sound of different electronic instruments.<br>  We have several software that transforms the sounds into midi and MP3.

Myspace should ask to confirm if you're sure you want to delete an account.

You should get your own so you aren't compromising your secured information.|`|RJkCYL4Haa	yes it does pick up wireless|`|zedTYkeqaa	Nothing can happen legally, though you are using someone else's connection, with it being an open connection (not needing a password of any kind) it's also going to be more open to hackers. As long as you have a good firewall and anti-virus you should be fine, but i would get your own interenet and have them set up a password setup. Let me put it this way when you use someone else's internet your using up what they are capable of (bandwidth) and if they get charged by the Gigabyte like some people are, your racking their bill up. How would you like that? Sooner or later they may cut you off by activating their passwords and stuff (the passwords are known as security keys). Then your without internet. The safest way is to get your own, while what your doing is ok temporary,look into the internet service providers in your area and compare shop. Hope this helps and have a safe and fun time surfing! I might add, that the law is different in all states, while it could be illegal in one it isn't in another one. So tread carefully. It depends on the state, as some feel that if your dumb enough not to activate your keys then you should have your internet "stolen". They feel that it's hard to steal something when you have it out, why do you think alot of places have wifi? So be careful and ultimately get your own to be at the safest.|`|c7KCto2Raa	if it is an unsecured network then the person who owns the network may actually be able to see what your doing!!

jSq4ZO1uaa	As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website. If you are going to create your website: 1- Buy a domain name. To get a domain name, you have to pay an annual fee to a registrar for the right to use that name. 2- Buy a web hosting service to provide your online space and enable you to get your website online at your purchased domain name.<br>  <br>  If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free.

3GmG8uQzaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III.

Usually it's used for wireless card (non USB) but you can add other things to it as will, it is capable of higher speeds the USB 2.0 is, but isn't used much anymore, since USB hubs are generally a cheaper way to add more, $20 for a hub compared to $40 somthing for the card, I wouldn't worry too much about it these days. But good question as not many know that it's there, since they are usually hidden by those card things which are just protectors of the slot itself.

DjR6rKuUaa	hi<br>  <br>  this HOAX is going round since MSN was created..<br>  don't believe anything<br>  <br>  ★Variations of this email have been circulating since 1999 but it is still a common visitor to in-boxes across the world. The hoaxes also travel via MSN Messenger. <br>  <br>  The information in these messages is completely untrue. Like a lot of hoaxes, this one banks on the fact that many people will hit the "forward" button without analyzing the information very deeply. Even if Hotmail was "running out of resources", it would be highly improbable for them to attempt to remedy the problem by asking customers to forward an email. Why would Hotmail employ such a vague, hit and miss method of checking on the status of account holders? If Hotmail really wanted to find out if users still had an active account they would be more likely to send an email that asked for a reply within a given time frame rather than request that the message be forwarded. Besides, I'm sure that Hotmail has sophisticated and precise methods of checking the activity levels of a given account that do not require the account holder to reply to or forward a specific message.<br>  <br>  ★Although the above example is aimed at Hotmail, variations of the hoax have also targeted Yahoo and AIM instant messaging customers.<br>  <br>  ????????*`?. ? ??ρε ? ?εlρε??.?* ????????<br>  ☆<br>  ::: (\(\ <br>  *: (=' :') :* <br>  ?..

It can often cure the problem of lost connections after the removal of Adware components or improper uninstall of firewall applications or other tools that modify the XP network and Winsock settings. If you encounter connection problems after removing network related software, Adware or after registry clean-up; and all other ways fail, then give WinSock XP Fix a try. It can create a registry backup of your current settings, so it is fairly safe to use. I actually tested it on a test machine* that was having a Winsock problem due to some Adware removal, and after running the utility and rebooting, the connectivity was restored.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/winsockxpfix.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/winsockxpfi...</a>|`|b8VRlStoaa	you shouldn't be unplugging your modem.

Hopefully you know how to enter the BIOS set up utility to do that. Then skip the first option for repair, and then choose install. Now you get 2 options again, brand new install or repair a previous installation. Choose this one. Everything else should remain as it was. But you will need the key from the disk or sticker on the machine. And you will have to go out to Microsoft, and get all the updates that were not on your windows disk. This cold be time consuming. Never the less, this should provide a fresh start. If not, then you may have a real hardware problem. If you want to verify the hardware independently of Windows, then you should download a Ubuntu iso image, burn the image to a disk, and boot from there. That is called running Linux from a live CD. If that runs, your hardware is OK.  Then perhaps a brutal form of reloading windows might be appropriate.

Since they are able to do that, they can upload those photos into a new profile and claim to be that person.

ARiiccLTaa	If you are looking for quality registry repair software to rid of slow computer problems, anti-virus and anti-spyware products have trouble detecting the computer irregular behavior, computer freezes and crashes are becoming commonplace, and performance is a problem in most applications. We all realize how frustrating and stressful that it is to deal with continuous computer performance problems and system crashes. Making a decision about what product would be best to fix the problem adds more to that stress.<br>  <br>  There are a handful of top registry repair products that can do a quick and effective job for you. In most of these products there is only a small margin that separates them. This article will show you what to look for when shopping for software.<br>  <br>  Feature 1: Download Simplicity and Ease of Use<br>  <br>  There are a few programs that are extremely difficult to download and even more difficult to grasp the features in the user interface. The top products are completely opposite. The download is quick with only a few clicks and the user window that appears has an easy to use layout with descriptions of each feature when clicked on. The premier registry cleaner software programs give descriptions of each feature once you download the user interface during the free scan process. There should also be an online help guide in case you get stuck.<br>  <br>  Feature 2: Include Repair and Optimization Features<br>  <br>  Though repair and cleaning are the only issues on purchaser's minds, the best software programs offer optimization features to supplement repair characteristics. Good software programs will have tools that will complete system defrag (to free hard drive space), remove Internet Explorer plug-ins that slow your internet, and that remove viruses and spy ware from your computer. Not only do you get effective repair options, now you also get Internet Explorer plug-in removers, evidence scanners and cleaners, registry defrags, junk file cleaners, all in addition to standard scanning features.<br>  <br>  Now you can get so much more for your money. The following scan categories should be included in the software: Shared Program Paths, Application Paths, File Associations, Active X/Coms/OLE, Font Files, Help Files, Toolbars, Shared DLL Files, Invalid Shortcuts, Most Recent Files, and Startup Files.<br>  <br>  Feature 3: Automated System Back Up<br>  <br>  This feature saves your previous file "state" in case you are not happy with the changes made to your PC after the repair is complete. Sometimes changes made from repair are not what we expected. It is great to have the option to go back to the status we had prior to the repair in case we want to restore some of the files we selected to remove prior. Top registry repair software will ensure that you have a way to return to this previous state. This is considered the piece of mind attribute!<br>  <br>  Feature 4: Automated File Selection<br>  <br>  If you do not know what you are looking for in file changes, do not worry. The software programs that exist are designed to not be overly assumptive and remove critical files. If you are an advanced user, this feature can come in handy as you can select files you want removed without having to do the tedious work of self-registry repair.<br>  <br>  Feature 5: More than a One Use License<br>  <br>  Since you will need registry repair functions as part of an ongoing plan, you will want to be sure that the license is good for a year. It is best to get in the practice of scanning and repairing at least once or twice a week. By having a long-term license you can continually maintain your PC.<br>  <br>  Feature 6: Great Service and Tech Support<br>  <br>  Many of the best products have fantastic help files and you may never need a person due to the simplicity of the download. Still, it is always good to send a test email to the company to see how quickly they respond back to you. Take notice about how prompt the response is and how professionally you are treated. This will show you how good of hands you will be in if you get stuck while using their product.<br>  <br>  There are a massive amount of products that are separated only by a small margin. A few of products are far supreme in the number of features and repair effectiveness for the investment. The ultimate goal should always be to get the errors fixed as quickly and easily as possible at the lowest cost.|`|19d5770cab150410883b6c4338772a48aa	ccleaner|`|d3whLZieaa	the most reliable program will be REGCURE it cleans and optimises all of your computer.

duIpmozQaa	It's an anti-spyware/adware program that is also has a built in immunisation program to protect your computer and it helps prevent popups. It is not a virus protector like AVG, Avira or AVAST. Its a free program but you have to update it manually at least once a week for it to be effective.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	It does a few things that are good for your computing experience.  It has a passive defense and an active scanner.  The passive defense keeps things out using a database of black-listed sites, plug-ins, cookies, and even links to black-listed sites.  The active scanner searches through your Windows registry and temporary Internet files folders to find things that either can't be blocked or have already made it into your system.  It can then remove any bogus or harmful entries, cookies, or bots that it finds.<br>  <br>  Basically it's looking for spyware, data-miners, key-loggers, and a few other nasty web-based threats.  Many current antivirus programs have expanded their repertoire to include some malware/spyware threats, but since viruses are a different kind of program it's not logical extension of antivirus capabilities.  That's why it's good to have separate programs that each specialize in their particular area.

It will tell you exactly what the spyware is called and give you a very detailed description of what the potential risks are of that particular cookie, temporary internet file, etc.  Then if you tell it to do so...it will remove it from your computer.  It really works well and helps to keep your computer going fast and not bogged down with trojans and spyware, tracking cookies and things that hurt the performance of your system.  I scan with it at the end of every day, and it's never been anything except very helpful. <br>  <br>  Kelly|`|fUd54bcsaa	I have it and it will look for all possible threats on your pc and will delete them.

MPldgkkMaa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.<br>  <br>  Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.<br>  <br>  Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.<br>  <br>  1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.<br>  <br>  2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.<br>  <br>  3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.<br>  <br>  Now that you know what it takes to clean windows registry doesn't mean you can do this all by yourself, unless you are an IT professional.<br>  <br>  For more information on free Windows registry repair visit the site.<br>  <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|VBngSH9raa	1) Uninstall Applications you don't need<br>  Start > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs<br>  <br>  2) Defrag your harddrives<br>  Start > My Computer > Right Click Drive to Defrag and select Properties > Tools > Defrag Now<br>  <br>  3) Remove Temporary Files to increase free disc space<br>  Start > (All) Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Clean Up<br>  <br>  4) Disable Start Up programs you don't need.<br>  Start > Run > type in "msconfig" > Click the 'Start-Up' tab > Click 'Disable all' > Click 'Ok' (then make sure you restart)<br>  <br>  This is one of the best ways to increase the speed of your PC. If there's software that you need or would like to run on start up every time just go back through and check the programs you'd like. Also don't worry about your Anti-Virus programs, those will automatically start every time no matter what.<br>  <br>  5) Download and run Tune-up (comes with 30 day free trial)<br>  <br>  6) Make sure you have at least 15 % of all of your hard drives free. As hard drives fill up they take longer to find/read information on them, thus being slower.<br>  <br>  7) Make sure you have the proper drivers for your graphic card.<br>  <br>  8) Sometimes Vista can have a bit too much eye candy, turning down the graphics of the Windows Task bar and Windows can actually make a difference.<br>  <br>  9) If worse comes to worse and none of these work it may be time for you to reformat (wipe everything), and if that doesn't fix everything then it's time for an upgrade.<br>  <br>  Also note viruses and spyware/malware can significantly slow down your computer, so make sure your protected and clean against all of the latest computer viruses and spyware.|`|DjGEJfaPaa	There are several things you can do to increase the "speed" of your computer. <br>  <br>  1) Clean up the disk. Uninstall unneeded programs (specifically those that run at startup and/or put something in the system tray), run Disk Cleanup, and defragment the drive. This is a good first step that will almost always take a few seconds off boot time and application loads for any computer.<br>  <br>  2) Stomp auto-starting programs. Click Start > Run and type "msconfig" at the prompt. Click the Startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your PC. Do you really need "Adobe Reader Speed Launch"? Probably not. Turn off anything else that looks useless, but be careful not to disable your anti-virus and important system components.<br>  <br>  3) Run a full anti-virus and anti-spyware scan. I would recommend AVG Free anti-virus, Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware remover. These programs are all free.<br>  <br>  4) Clean up the registry. CCleaner, available at <a href="http://www.ccleaner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com</a> is free and worth running. It will also remove unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. <br>  <br>  Those are the easy and free things you can do. If your computer is still slow you need to move on to the bigger guns.<br>  <br>  1) Upgrade RAM. This is the one killer trick that will make almost any computer run faster. With an older PC, you will rarely have enough RAM to run today's memory-hogging operating systems and applications, and adding a high-capacity stick or two of quality RAM will give you a quick speed boost. Adding RAM is fairly simple, even for a novice, and you should be able to do the job in 5 or 10 minutes.You can run a free test at <a href="http://www.crucial.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com</a> and find out what kind of RAM (memory) your computer needs.<br>  <br>  2) Reinstall Windows. If the above tricks haven't helped, it may be time to wipe the slate clean and start again, reformatting your hard drive, reinstalling your applications, and restoring your data files from a backup. You'd be surprised how much more responsive a freshly reinstalled Windows system can be, as you've wiped out years of temp files, garbled registry entries, old versions of software programs that have been upgraded repeatedly, and all sorts of other electronic junk. Reinstalling is easy if you have the "recovery disk" that came with your PC, and only a bit more involved if you're using a retail copy of Windows XP. Just be sure you back up everything you want to take with you before you pull the trigger! <br>  <br>  3) Upgrade your hard drive. This is a more complicated solution, but if you're reinstalling Windows (per the prior tip) you might consider upgrading to a bigger and possibly faster hard drive, too. Hard disk storage is a performance bottleneck on every machine, and magnetic disks degrade over time. Some performance issues could be caused by a failing hard drive, even, and upgrading to a new model could really put some zip back in your system. As a bonus, you can use the original hard drive for backups or occasional storage, if you put it in an enclosure.|`|Fk3TupqVaa	You can use a registry cleaner to clean up your computer and then make your computer faster,Why?the reason is that there may be some registry errors and remnant,corrupt files and temp files in your computer to cause "computer slow".<br>  Every time you install and uninstall software on your computer and surfing online you create junk in the computer registry.over time, the registry can grow to enormous proportions, especially if the various programs you've installed do not do a good job of deleting and/or updating it's Registry entries.You need to scan and clean your computer with registry cleaner to make it fast.Good Registry Cleaner will improve your computer and Internet performance dramatically!<br>  There are some comparison and review of TOP 5 registry cleaners.<br>  <a href="http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.speed-up-my-computer.com</a><br>  You can download and scan your computer for free.|`|XVpq4tOQaa	Internet speed is normally not related to computer speed, your connection is bad if its just the internet loads slow|`|5aoAcXDGaa	That nothing to do with your computer. its mostly because of the internet.

Is there a version inbetween the two that you have not used?<br>  <br>  I guess with BIOS the old adage about "if it ain't broke dont fix it" is very true.Did you actually need something in the updated BIOS - or were you just doing some routine updating?<br>  <br>  The simplest of all options might just be to reflash with the old BIOS.

It is possible to have issues with backward compatibility, i.e. going from XP or Vista to Win98. Vista and XP are so Plug-and-Play friendly that it is highly unlikely you'll have an issue.<br>  <br>  Other possibilites, though unlikely, might be:<br>  --laptop running on battery power<br>  --other devices on same USB chain (try isolating your Flash Drive)<br>  --Plug-and-Play disabled<br>  --Damaged USB port<br>  --Damaged or corrupt file system.|`|kAkdJJZIaa	Open 'my computer', plug it in and see if it pops up there.

Torrents are not ilegal, but often their contents are (i am talking about copyrights).

1fB2UdRHaa	Two-dimensional animations and three-dimensional animations are too far different, learning two-dimensional animations won't exactly help all that much, you would be using different programs to do similar but largely different things. I recommend you search the web for "basic 3d animation tutorials" and other such assorted subjects.<br>  <br>  A great, completely free program for three-dimensional animation and design is Blender and you can find many tutorials for the program. It has a very steep learning curve but once you know it, it sticks with you if you use it a lot. Here is the official website where you can find tutorials and downloads: <a href="http://www.blender.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.blender.org/</a><br>  <br>  As for college classes I'm not sure, you can go to special schools like Devry Media Arts and Technology college.

A window will open up, and on the left side you click,"device Manager". Now look for sound devices on the right hand pane.  If there is one with an exclamation point, or other warning, deleter it. Then restart the computer. Have your original disks handy, as Windows will start up with a "Found New Harware" message. Your task now is to match up the prompts with your disk containing the audio hardware driver. Alternatively, you cold use IE and pick from the top, "Windows Update". Then you choose to look at the updates, and there should be one for your audio hardware. This is often the case, because hardware manufacturers want to be Windows compatible, and they do that by submitting their software drivers to Microsoft for certification. Then the drivers are available from Microsoft. If you have hardware that you know the name of, you can go to the manufacturers web site, like Intel or Creative.com for soundblaster.|`|f7b6fb25c4a5d05b13f7d64d5680b899aa	When installing an audio card, remove the card from the computer, when you reboot install the drivers.<br>  <br>  Shutdown and reinsert the card into it's proper slot, then reboot.<br>  <br>  At this point Windows will detect the card and install the proper drivers.<br>  <br>  This works best when the drivers may be corrupted, and need to be reloaded from the installation disc.

KGaH6faIaa	I assume you're connecting using an analog VGA cable.<br>  <br>  Check your TV manual to see if there is a native resolution, such as 1366 x 768, and try setting your laptop video card to output using that resolution.<br>  <br>  Also, check if the refresh rate is supported by your TV. If your TV is new, chances are the best refresh rate to use is 60 Hz.|`|VtnwtXtFaa	u have to lower the comps resolution to 1024 x 768....ur tv is too big..u didnt say what cables u were using....so here is a breakdown of it all just incase u didnt know..Computer to TV connections almost universally disappoint in the end. They can work well for things like using a large screen TV for presentations, but TVs are not suitable replacements for monitors. Especially if you're using S-video as the connection mode, since s-video has a maximum resolution of about 576i, or a standard PAL resolution.<br>  However, if you insist on learning off of this yourself, you need to poke around in the video card settings and make sure the s-video output is enabled. On some cards you can only have output on one mode or the other. So if you enable s-video output, your monitor will no longer receive any input. This will likely change the resolution of your desktop and screw up icon placements and several other things.<br>  If you're looking to make something of a home theater setup, don't use a computer with s-video to do it. Spend the money to get some set atop box or a computer designed to be a home theater system. If you want to use it as a monitor, don't even bother with s-video as your only option. If you were using VGA/DVI/HDMI/Component connections... Then it might work for specific situations. Any other uses probably aren't worth it either.<br>  if using the S-Video port..then you'll need to enable it within windows. Right-click on the desktop and click Properties. In that window click the Settings tab and if there are two blue boxes click the one that mored greyed out. Below you'll see a white box with the words "Expand my Windows desktop to this monitor." Click that and hit the Apply button. If it all works after that click OK.<br>  If your TV has a DVI/HDMI input there is a program you can use to adjust the resolution and video timing to make it fit right. I know it works with most ATI and NVidia cards - probably others too.<br>  It is called PowerStrip3 ...<br>  i personally use the vga cord...i unscrew it from my monitor and hook it up to my big screen...but b4 doing that i have to change the resolution to a lower setting or else it'll be fine booting but then turn blank...but keep in mind vga has no audio so u will need a single male plug to rca jacks...i jimmy rigged one from old headphones...i took the plug from the headphones and stripped it the metal...and i took old rca's and stripped the ends..i soldered the rcas to the headphone jack..taped it up and it works like a charm...i know... way ghetto...but wasnt going out at 8pm to buy 1 so i made 1 in less than 10 mins...lol...gl..if u have any question just email me.

You don't need to image your computer to do that.<br>  Please, FFS, at least learn the words.<br>  <br>  In case you're talking about wiping and re-installing everything, there's Acronis True Image for Windows, and Carbon Copy Cloner for Mac.<br>  <br>  But why would you want to do that, and then put the same image back on?

GQ6K85LPaa	If you want to print our the occasional thing, and some photos on glossy papers, go for an inkjet<br>  <br>  If you are likely to print longer documents, go laser.<br>  <br>  modern colour laser printers do a remarkably good job on photos IF you use a decent "colour laser paper" of 90-160gsm and remember to set the printer to it's thick paper mode.|`|g62ATenqaa	There is no doubt that lasers are still way ahead in terms of quality but, though prices have come down considerably in past few years and it is possible to get even colour lasers very economically, what you have to consider is the running cost.  very, very expensive in terms of replacement cartridges and the drum. For home use, inkjets are preferable and are good quality, especially if you use 90gm paper. Even if you pick up a laser quite cheap, and they are cheap now, it could turn out to be an expensive mistake because of costly replacements.|`|1bRRODd2aa	Inkjet for normal home use, the cartridges are much cheaper.  If you are a heavy / business / high volume user then go for a laser printer.|`|iTBqOwxtaa	Both Laser and Inkjet are available for less than $100.<br>  So the initial cost is about the same.<br>  Now, the operating cost is lower with a Laser.<br>  Example: One Laser Cartridge costs about $60 and prints 1500 pages (or more). That is 4 cents per page.<br>  One Inkjet Cartridge costs about $30 and prints 300 pages. That is 10 cents per page.<br>  Depending of how many pages you print, it may be less expensive in the long run to buy a Laser.<br>  Let's say that in one year you print 3000 pages: The total cost of the Laser is $100+$120 (2 cartridges)=$220 and the total cost of the Inkjet would be $100+$300 (10 cartridges)=$400.<br>  You could figure it more exactly after you decide which ones of either type you would buy.|`|z46THMt8aa	If you have a need to print out high quality photos, a laser  can't touch an inkjet for that. But if you can skip the photos or don't need top quality, the Samsung CLP300 color laser does a nice job on photos and a great job on text. I got mine for $80 at Staples after a big rebate. I also bought an extra set of toner cartridges for $70 at <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> but even though I've done a lot of printing over the year, I'm still on the original set.<br>  <br>  If you dont need color at all, you can find a Brother monochrome laser for about $60. I have 2 HL-2040's going on a few years old on which I printed thousands of pages. I bought toner refills from northbaytoner for about $6 each, but you need a $3 part called a resetter in order to refill the toner. You can find them at <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/North-Bay-Toner-Company" rel="nofollow">http://stores.ebay.com/North-Bay-Toner-C...</a><br>  <br>  If you need high quality photos, only an inkjet will do. As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|Cg7yWSo9aa	they both have there good points and bad points. It just depends what you like yourself.|`|BMHG9Hswaa	Actually, all Laser printers use toner and cartridges.  The toner is inside the cartridge.<br>  <br>  There are a couple key points to keep in mind when buy a printer.<br>  1.  Does it have the features you want, no sense in buying one that doesn't have what you need.<br>  2.  Is it in your budget?<br>  3.  Do you need color?  Color laserjets, especially cheap ones, can be really costly to own.  To figure out what it will cost you, take the number of pages the cartridge is rated for divided by the cost, that gives you cost per page for that cartridge.<br>  <br>  As for my preferences now, I like the HP LaserJet P2015 and Brothers Black and color laser printers

It also has a load time when used in a browser; flash/silverlight is a much better alternative for web based applications.<br>  <br>  The .NET languages are my favorite, they are backed fully by microsoft and work on any machine with the .NET framework.  With a company like microsoft you can get vast amounts of help through the MSDN library, some of the smartest IDE's(visual studios) and a consistent evolution in languages.  When used in a browser with ASP .NET only the host needs .NET and not the client, that means anyone can see your website  no matter what the OS is.<br>  <br>  Unlike the other two, PHP is only for web development.  When compared to ASP .NET it is lacking IMHO.  With so many IDEs there's not really a standard.. I think Visual Web Developer really makes the transition from production to live that much easier.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	There is nothing to compare, these are three different entities.

AA11172918	There is a huge difference between Photoshop and Photoshop Elements. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that all of the top digital scrapbook kit designers use Photoshop.<br>  <br>  You can make digital scrapbook papers and embellishments using Photoshop Elements, but you simply won't have the functions that Photoshop offers. <br>  <br>  If you're serious about this, get the full-blown version of Photoshop.

However, it costs whoever owns the network to connect you to the internet. You need to find out what your network is called so you can connect to it, not a neighbor's network (this happenes often)|`|R5IAmQAVaa	No, its not free.

All you have to do is have a router and PC/laptop that supports it.<br>  <br>  However, you will want to make sure that the router you're connected to is indeed your own. Otherwise you could possibly be connecting to someone else and using their internet connection instead of yours. This is generally considered rude, and depending on where you live, could also be illegal.|`|BTcQuHRmaa	No it wont cost you anything it seam like you have connected to a neighbors internet connection or something. So some one is most likely paying for it but free for you. It is also not illegal for you because this connection must be insecure as it has no password protection etc...|`|jH2NZTCuaa	nope, i do that, and its free.|`|sOCLwxnFaa	freeeeeeeee|`|5cac3c2d6bf93a7853355873685e3384aa	Well your supposed to configure your router... which usually starts with three numbers then . then 3 more numbers and etc.... from there you set up your own network... by naming your own.... Once you start a local connection meaning where your modem is directly connected to your desktop or laptop then you can access your router to set up your wireless connection... you set up the router so that once you have your settings configured then it will appear on your list... such as myhomeconnetion... or something else. People that have linksys just as a basic name didn't set up their router using their own SSID.. An ssid starts at the default name.. so if you bought a linksys routher it will say something like Linksys1 or something like that.<br>  <br>    If your connected wirelessly using a connection that's not yours then your sending information over the internet that is not secure and 2. it is illegal to begin with because if you get caught then your neighbor can possibly do something about it. You always start with an unsecured connection when you get a router.. so you have to set up your own with either a Wep key or with a phrase which is what I use. That way if your neighbor does try to access your connection, he can't get in unless he knows what your passphrase or wep (wireless encrip. protection) key is which is usually 26 numbers and letters long...<br>  <br>  I would suggest not using your neighbors wireless anymore and setting up your own, especially if you are sending data over the internet such as financial stuff.|`|ULw1777caa	You are probably connecting to someone else's unsecured connection, which is illegal.|`|ykXzzx65aa	No the wireless internet is free for u|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	No. You are probably connected to someone's wireless network that they are paying for and you are piggybacking on. It's illegal.|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	It probably belongs to one of your neighbors.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it's exactly legal, but if they have an unprotected network they're pretty much asking for it.|`|MczmTftTaa	it's your neighbors signal, what you're doing is illegal but you'll never get caught.

Since the files won't be in their specially-designed recovery partition, you might not even be able to boot from them, but definitely check your dell computer manual on that too.

9kfjIRLyaa	A wireless router is used to connect computers to the internet, wirelessly. It creates a firewall which means it is very hard for people to hack into your computer if you are "behind" a router. The way a computer can send emails and download stuff through a router is called "tunneling". By initiating the connection from the computer, the router lets information in to "respond" to the requests that the computer makes. In other words, connections passing through a router have to be initiated from the computer, not from a remote server, or the router will reject the traffic. When a computer goes to connect to a router it will ask the computer for a network key (unless the router is configured for open access) If the computer supplies the right key, the router lets the computer in. <br>  <br>  Also, you don't get phone reception in your house because the cell phone towers are outside of your house. The router is inside your house so you should be able to get a connection. Hope I help, or at least made for an interesting read.|`|rdxRkxi5aa	WiFi or wireless Fidelity is a common basic transmission system based on a 2.4GHz microwave system like Mobile phones, it can be affected inside the house but the transmission is likely to be via a phone line or a cable system if i read your question correctly.<br>  <br>  the tech is not new and the method of transmission is be around for ages, the system is the same 3 phase encryption and authentication, packets and frames and over octets systems, the ranges and frequency is determined by the component that you have bought.<br>  <br>  if your router system is from a cable land line or via cable in line then the issue is the segment link from the router to the computer and telemetry is involved between the two.<br>  <br>  please consult your handbook and see what you have to do to try and get computer and router to talk!|`|hXHBm1BSaa	If you can connect to the internet your wireless is working.

If you want to impress an employers, do the following:<br>  <br>  1) have a good portfolio of projects - if you have no work experience, then put together volunteer projects for your friends. Employers will be impressed by your commitment and sacrifice.  Tell employers straight up, "I haven't worked in a company before because I'm at the beginning of my career.  But I work hard and I have potential as evidenced by my portfolio of charitable web projects for non-profit organizations, family and friends.  I am always willing to sacrifice for my career and for the company I work for."<br>  <br>  2) network with people in the industry - go to  conferences and events and meet professionals in the field.  Tell them you're a student, and you want advice on how to improve your skills.<br>  <br>  If you do items 1 and 2, you will have no problem getting a job.

Your computer was matched as a unit, with its operating system and drivers. Welcome to a world of hurt.<br>  <br>  You can wipe the drive completely while you're installing XP. On the screen where you select where to install XP, you can delete the existing partition. That will cause the installer to treat the drive as blank, which is sufficient.<br>  <br>  We can probably give you more detailed help if you describe the error. Saying "many errors" is not helpful. The master error code would be helpful. I'm guessing it's 0x0000007E.<br>  <br>  Are you installing XP with at least SP2 integrated? If not, you'll be in for a world of hurt.

Then do this:<br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Askers for another virus programs.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090303143050AAQNkf9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  The 1st person is right, Norton Sucks! here is how to remove it totally from your system and free programs that will fix it with instructions on how to install and use them:<br>  <br>  I need to know what Operating System you are using. Because some have a Norton removale tool. If your pc does not have this, you have to first uninstall Norton, then do a search in the registry for Norton, then Symantic, and NAV, to delete all strings and folders that  that have anything to do with Norton anti virus. You can search Google for complete instruction on how to do this. Then uninstall every other anti virus program you have installed and all the spy ware and adware searching programs. Then reboot your computer. Then search Google first for Spybot Search & Destroy use the site safer networking solutions. Choose UAS , and then pick a download mirror to download from, any of theirs is good and I have used others too. When you install it make sure you also download the TeaTimer. You do not need to download other languages or other skins. But DO do the automatic updates selection. After it is installed, run it. It will take a while to do the scan but let it go. It will find everything that is not good on your pc showing all just before it is completed scanning. Do not be surprised to see thousands of items that need to be fixed. After scan check FIX ALL ITEMS. It may not remove all of them yet but you can in the next step. After it fixes what it can in the first step, reboot your pc and go into SAFE MODE by continually clicking the F8 and or the F10  key as soon as the system starts to boot. A screen will come up, select safe mode. The run spybot again and do another scan and fix all items found, then reboot. Then download NOD32. These two programs are the best programs ever and have been around for years and have a daily update feature, Spybot is totally free and NOD32 is free for 30 days but I know people that I installed it on their pcs that its been free for years as is mine. If you need more help email me telling me you need more help and I answered your question here. pastorwilliambarhorst@yahoo.com These programs use the smallest memory than any other programs out there and are the smallest most powerful ones out there. If you need more help I will give you my cell phone number so I can walk you through it all. I have installed these on many friends computers all around the world and I can give you their contact info as refferences! I did this using several remote access programs fixing their pc from my pc here in Pennsylvania connecting to theirs taking control of their pc using both RADMIN a remote Administrator program and Windows Live Messenger when they request Remote Assistance.you can add me to your Yahoo messenger pastorwilliambarhorst@yahoo.com and Windows Live Messenger. But contact me first with Yahoo messenger or Email as I only launch Windows Messenger when I need to fix someones computer remotely.
jkG6tbseaa	Yes, it is totally worth it. I use Ubuntu 8.10, and I have no problems. You will only need a blank CD. Go to www.ubuntu.com and download the ISO file. Burn this to your CD. This will create what is known as a "live CD". This is what you'll use to install Ubuntu. Next, boot up your computer with the disk in the drive. It should bring you to a screen to select your language, next it will give you the options to either Start Ubuntu from the CD to try it out with NO effects on your computer. If you like what you see, you can install by double-clicking the install icon on the desktop. It will guide you through the steps of installing (The installer is probably one of the best ones I have ever seen). When you come to the partition section, be sure to select the full disk partition option. THIS WILL ERASE ALL DATA SO BE SURE TO BACK UP WHATEVER YOU NEED. The installation will take about 30-45 minutes. Then you should be up and ready to go. Finally I would recommend going to the update manager and updating as there will some updates.

Im not sure if they do this with laptops or not, but cellphones have a stick on (or inside) them that changes color if it's submerged in water. also the labels on the computer (or on some of the parts) having faded and/or become wrinkled would also be a dead giveaway. you could take it into a 3rd party computer shop and ask them to try to salvage your data, and then if they can you can have it transfered to a new computer, because unless you signed up for their accidental damage prevention, you dont have much of a choice in the matter, other than getting a brand new laptop.|`|rSIF5jtSaa	Sorry but, there isn't a way.

Change the display size to something more manageable (depends on your monitor size, so I couldn't give you an exact spec to use).|`|qtNcmXz8aa	Windows probably decided that it was going to change your monitor aspect ratio. It will autodetect your monitor size, and a lot of the time, Windows is so bad that it gets it wrong. What you need to do is go to the Control Panel, select display, and go to the far right tab. Select an aspect ratio, and click apply. If that fixes it, then you're good, if not, select another one and click apply. When you find the right one, you should have the problem fixed.<br>  <br>  Another option is to switch to Linux. just google "Why linux" and take the first hit.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to delete your "cache" or if you would<br>  like more "tips" on making YouTube run even better without <br>  having to buy/install a thing, then please click on my avatar <br>  and send me a message -- preferably with your YouTube or <br>  email address. I will guide you step-by-step in plain English <br>  and with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: Dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it. Do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,<br>  even though this seemingly contradicts all my advice which<br>  I wrote uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking "Don't <br>  Accelerate This Website" will not help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on how your YouTube account is set up,<br>  your personal "video playblack quality" (or "VPQ") could be<br>  set to "dynamically" or "fast", thus making YouTube videos<br>  play at higher quality. This in turn eats up lots of bandwidth,<br>  memory and "cache". If you are "logged on" to YouTube as <br>  you're reading this, you can verify your VPQ from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link below, which will <br>  bring you directly to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise, if you must "sign in" first, click on the 4th black<br>  option which will be on the left side called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube has changed in the<br>  past year. If anything, the newer Flash players are causing<br>  many YouTubers plenty of grief -- especially all 5 variations <br>  of version 10. It is absolutely crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54, and 10.12.36. Updates are only<br>  good for one thing: software/computer conflicts. Myself, I've <br>  never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear by <br>  9.45.

yMchHj9eaa	MACS suck, This is maybe the ultimate reason a mac owner will give you to explain why it's superior to a PC. The mac owner will tell you that all people that own macs are really satisfied with their computers and would never switch back. This is of course not true.<br>  The mac owner will also tell you that with a system from Apple you will never have to think about drivers, upgrades or anything. A mac is perfection itself when delivered. At least according to their standard. Many mac:s can't even be upgraded. So what you buy is what you get. Expect your system to be outdated within 1-2 years.<br>  Apple also states: "Only with a Mac do you get an operating system built by the same people who built the computer it runs on.". Actually Apple's Mac OS X (the operating system) is not based on their own technology, but by the technology of freeBSD. Apple's own capabilities in form of creating an operating system have been demonstrated in previous versions of Mac OS. It took an operating system based on someone else's technology to get a Mac multitasking and not behaving like an oversized pocket calculator from 1985. Oh and about mac crashing Yes it does! And it does it alot. The difference between a pc based on Windows crashing and a Mac is that on the pc the crash is in 99% of the cases caused by badly coded third party software, when the Mac just has a faulty operating system. Why else would Apple themselves run their india website on Linux RedHat?<br>  There is another fun part about crashes on the mac, it's almost always impossible to trace the source of the crash. When your mac crashes you simply reinstall the system. Sounds like a fun thing to do on your spare time, well buy a Mac then!|`|RCIr3Wnjaa	a duh

Do not make any attempt to boot your OS until you make sure your hardware is wrong. Loading an OS with flaky hardware can cause data loss.<br>  <br>  If this is a desktop, open it up.

(Check the graphics card carefully, if you have one. Make sure the heat sink is still attached and the fan isn't bogged down by dirt.) Turn on the power for just a few seconds and make sure all the fans spin (heat sink, power supply, graphics card if any).<br>  <br>  Next, turn the computer on but do not let the operating system boot. Just go into the BIOS setup. If the BIOS setup does not work reliably, you have a significant hardware problem.<br>  <br>  Then, make a memtest86+ CD on another computer. Boot from that CD on the problem machine. Let it run for several hours (unless it hits an error soon, in which case shut the machine off).

You need special software to compile the font and create the vector characters. I would advise you not to do it.

Download, unzip and then open the file wifi.pdf.<br>  <br>  The manual describes 3 different methods for installing the wifi adapter.  But all 3 methods have one thing in common, you must use the provided cable to connect the adapter directly to the motherboard.<br>  <br>  The cable provided with the adapter is actually a USB connector... well, it is what's used as a USB connector on the inside of a computer, anyway.  It's a very distinctive shape because it has 9 pins and is rectangular.  It has one row of 5 holes and one row of 4.  On your motherboard there will be several spots you can connect it to.  Each spot will have the same pin count (a row of 5 pins and a row of 4 pins).  Anytime you see this pin configuration, this is a USB interface.  It doesn't matter which one you connect it to, they have the same function.<br>  <br>  Now, in case you are still unsure...<br>  <br>  Go back to the link I provided above and at the bottom of the page click to go to page 2.  Here you will find the user manual for your motherboard.  Download, unzip and open it.  There is a color photograph of your motherboard in this pdf.  <br>  <br>  The USB headers on your motherboard are colored blue and there are two of them beside one another (#16 in the photo).  They are both located about an inch from the cmos battery (looks like a watch battery).  Connect the supplied cable to either of these two connectors.  One of the connectors might already be in use if you have USB ports on the front of your computer case.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Below are direct links to the WIFI manual download and the Motherboard manual download.<br>  <br>  By the way, congrats... that's a pretty kick-butt motherboard.  Triple SLI?  You gonna drop 3 nVidia 9800s in it?<br>  <br>  (Hmm... I was just browsing the motherboard manual again... looks like it came with a 4-port usb card-slot adpater.  If you connected this adapter then both of your USB headers will be occupied and you will have to remove one cable.  I'm not sure why anyone would need to add 4 more usb ports, anyway.. there's already 6 ports on the back panel... who needs 10?)|`|076i35yGaa	You can find the answer here:|`|G0pCxzgpaa	If you still have the motherboard manual or the wifi card manual read and make sure it doesn't say where it goes<br>  Otherwise i have never heard of pins on a motherboard for wifi...scam?

For example a M3A78 Pro motherboard states that it can use DDR2 667mhz, DDR2 800mhz and DDR2 1066mhz ram/memory(same thing) but also tells what memory for which socket set. For an AM2 socket you can use the DDR2 667 or 800 mhz ram. For an AM2+ socket you can use the DDR2 667, 800 or 1066 mhz ram.|`|6LW8h4rTaa	Your motherboard determines the max memory speed, the socket type (compatible CPU's) determines the top limit for the max speed.<br>  The CPU is AM2+.<br>  You don't need 64 bit OS to access the memory at that speed.<br>  You DO need 64 bit OS to use more than 3.5Gb.|`|F2YDKlSyaa	If the mobo is AM2+ then yes every thing should work fine.<br>  <br>  If you need to install any thing more then 3GB of memory you will need a 64bit OS to get it to be recognized correctly.
GzuiHX9Xaa	I don't think you should invade her privacy with a keylogger in the first place - even if she is your girlfriend it's actually illegal without her fore-sworn permission. You wouldn't be able to install any programs without admin privileges either.<br>  But you should speak to her instead of keylogging her. You'll seriously break up the relationship if she isn't and you get found out. she'll be very very very offended that you don't trust her, and have to hack her computer to put your mind at peace.

AA10959572	Depends on the company's tolerance level... <br>  <br>  Check with your warranty, usually it will state how many dead pixel it considers acceptable... especially if the laptop is new.<br>  <br>  Some LCD pixels may go away (fix themselves) but not that often.|`|Y1BqGjGLaa	With it being one pixel, I would say that it is the monitor, If it is still under the warranty take it to the place you bough it, if they'll take it, or send it to the manufacture, that is if they cover it. So it sounds like what you know what your are talking about, the issues you seem to have is what is called a stuck pixel. This is where the pixel is always on, and it is an manufacturing defect, One way to fix it is to mechanically manipulating the area around a defective pixel by pressing or tapping. This will make the oil inside of the LCD, but it CAN DAMAGE it even more, so I wouldn't do it, just the manufacture or store. Other wise just deal with it. For even more information look at the two sites.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people are suggesting you either use or get something, DO NOT TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

U can also compress the video to a lower quality because youtube will do it anyway after you upload which will kind of waste your data, i had a 200mg video and it ended up at 32megs. 0_o anyway...|`|AA11828104	Check with your ISP for monthly limitation.<br>  Video uploaded to YouTube usually not that big because everyone chop the long video off into few pieces before upload.

As I type this, my main machine is running a Norton scan in Safe Mode after some critically severe symptoms popped up this morning.<br>  <br>  As to your your problem, I would certainly quarantine (or whatever Avast calls it when it takes a baddy out of commission but doesn't actually delete it from the machine) the suspects.<br>  <br>  Remember Safe Mode, especially if whatever finds something can't seem to get rid of it.  Safe Mode often keeps malware from protecting itself.<br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.<br>  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.<br>  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  <br>  6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|SMNdtU0iaa	Why have an anti virus program if it suggests that your remove viruses and you don't trust it?

When Avast finds something that I don't know about or that is in System32 such as you describe the very first thing I do is hop on my Linux box and 'google' each and every infection that is found to research whether it is safe to simply delete or if it should be quarantined instead. Before deleting a file it is safe to quarantine it to see how it affects the system. Things in System32 can be quite tricky to deal with. Sometimes just the "right" file in System32 being infested can cause you to have to do a complete OS re-install. I hope you find that is not the case with your particular problem(s).<br>  <br>  Here's what I've found out about "c:\windows\system32\pretec.dat":<br>  <br>  It's an infestation of 'antivirus 2009'<br>  <br>  The answer that I had picked to copy and paste from:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/894093" rel="nofollow">http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/894093</a><br>  <br>  Is too long to put here in it's entirety so you'll have to go to the site to see what they have to say about it.<br>  <br>  Read about the mswinsck.ocx thing here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.processlibrary.com/directory/files/mswinsck/" rel="nofollow">http://www.processlibrary.com/directory/...</a><br>  <br>  After you get your computer cleaned up and the way you want it then get Firefox from here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/</a><br>  <br>  Once installed, open FF, click on Tools>Add-ons>Get Add-ons>Browse All Add-ons.

If it's external then maybe you have a bad connection.  Try unplugging then replugging the USB cable back in.<br>  Anyway, it's hard to tell from the info supplied.  Post back more details and we'll see what can be done.<br>  Oh, the card isn't locked is it?<br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  edit:  My bad.  You said plug it into a slot.  That makes it internal.  More than likely the slot has dust in it which hampers the connection. That, or you need to wiggle the card until the light on the reader goes on.<br>  <br>  edit2: It could be that the plug for the reader inside your computer needs to be unplugged and replugged.<br>  Computers are funny things in that say, desktops, are not designed for any kind of movement by and large and if they get jarred, connections sometimes get loose. Heck, this even happens if they don't get jarred.<br>  For laptops, the situation is even worse.  They are made for a certain amount of movement .

I Have had a little experience with installing 2 os's on two seperate drives.<br>  <br>  You installed windows xp on a ide drive most computers like chucking the os that has a ide drive as the main drive<br>  <br>  Option 1. If you know how to get into your bios do that then look for hard drive boot menu when you find that from there you will have a list of your hard drives on that computer move them around until the one with vista is at the top save the bios then reboot. This will temporaraly fix the problem<br>  <br>  Option 2. You can open up your computer take off  the ide cable for your xp drive then turn on your computer preferably with out the cover on it as you will need to put the cable back in the drive.wait for vista to load up then shutdown the machine. put the ide cable back into your hard drive then turn on the machine doing this will usually tell the computer the main hard drive is the vista drive not the xp drive.<br>  <br>  Option 3 is a bootmanager. There are allot out there linux os has its own bootmanager but why enter another operating system into the mix here its quite confusing with 2 LOL. I Do remember an old bit of software i had once it booted up from disk or usb then installed itself on the bootsector and gave you a choice of hard drives to load up. But that was a bit technical though. <a href="http://www.boot-us.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boot-us.com/index.htm</a> this site here offers boot time management of your drives Free for home use and good technical support.

It is not the video file itself.  You need to run the torrent file through a torrent application like uTorrent or BitTorrent.  That will cause you download the actual video file.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|9FBh8Mu0aa	Follow the instructions on my blogs to set up your PC to get rid of a computer virus.

FBQZ06vraa	If you have an anti-virus, make sure it has the latest virus definitions and run a scan with it in Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking.  That often prevents malware from protecting itself.  If you don’t have one, many people here swear by AVG (it’s free). <br>  <br>  I suggest you also download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (they’re free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesn’t seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode. <br>  <br>  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.  <br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.<br>  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.<br>  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  <br>  6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.<br>  <br>  Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
2SSA9e9Naa	DirectX is the windows Graphical subsystem for high speed complex manipulation of system I/O (video, screen, sound, game controllers, etc). It is used by developers to create games, presentation type of applications, etc. Software more than simple GUI applications.<br>  <br>  ActiveX is a system component (you can think of it as a library) that incapsulates a set of functionality. For example, an activeX control can be used to draw graphs, or control USB devices, etc. It is a way to contain and release system software that cannot be used directly by a person but needs to be incorporated into a program that uses it's features. It enables run time binding of the application to the functions. Typically when software is created using libraries the interfaces are statically linked at the time of creation. The run time binding allows for updates to the ActiveX control without having to get a new version of applications that use it.<br>  <br>  Some directX components are implemented through ActiveX components.<br>  <br>  Does that help? If you look these terms up in Wikipedia.org you will get a more detailed explanation.|`|0e1b5ddf7169219ceeb5068f287654aeaa	Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth. DirectX, then, was the generic term for all of these APIs and became the name of the collection. After the introduction of the Xbox, Microsoft has also released multiplatform game development APIs such as XInput, which are designed to supplement or replace individual DirectX components.<br>  <br>  Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Xbox, and Microsoft Xbox 360. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names "DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably.<br>  <br>  The DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2.[1] Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples.<br>  <br>  The latest versions of Direct3D, namely, Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 9Ex, are only officially available for Windows Vista, because each of these new versions was built to depend upon the new Windows Display Driver Model that was introduced for Windows Vista. The new Vista/WDDM graphics architecture includes a new video memory manager that supports virtualizing graphics hardware to multiple applications and services such as the Desktop Window Manager<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ACTIVE X<br>  ActiveX is a component object model (COM) developed by Microsoft for Windows. By using the COM runtime, developers can create software components that perform a particular function or a set of functions. A software application can then compose one or more components in order to provide the functionality it intends to.[1] Many Microsoft Windows applications — including many of those from Microsoft such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Studio, Windows Media Player, etc. — use ActiveX controls to build their feature set as well as encapsulate their functionality as ActiveX controls so that the functionality can be embedded in other applications. Internet Explorer also allows the ActiveX controls to be embedded inside web pages.

C2aWncmkaa	It is illegal for anyone to access your computer over the Internet without your permission.  It's the law.<br>  <br>  Are you a high school student or a college student ?<br>  If you are a high school student, you probably do not have the right to use the school's computer system to access your home computer at all.  Unless you have a written contract, you are going to have a problem with this one.  But continue reading, you might find something useful.<br>  <br>  If you are a college student, well, this is going to be interesting.<br>  <br>  When you accessed your computer from the school's system, you made it extremely easy for someone in their computer department to get nosy and snoop around in your computer.  You probably accessed your computer over FTP or HTTP and not HTTPS - in other words, you sent a plain-text log-in and password out, which anyone in the school computer system could trap and study.<br>  <br>  That person might have given the information to someone else who then attacked your home computer through the Internet, but still using the school's computer system.  So how do you know who attacked your computer ?<br>  <br>  You cannot get someone fired from the school just on your sayso unless the people who run the school are very very good friends with you already.  Don't even try.<br>  <br>  But perhaps you could notify the school management of what you found and let them know their technicians are doing things that might be illegal - the last thing the school adminstration wants is for the newspapers to run stories about hackers attacking and modifying people's computer systems using the school computers.  After all, you found an archive called "hack suit" and a folder called "random shizz" - that's modification without your permission.<br>  <br>  The goal here is to make the technicians sweat over the possibility they could lose their jobs.  In this economy, they might have problems getting another job.<br>  <br>  To enforce your legal rights you will have to talk to a lawyer.  A good lawyer will help you decide if you have a case to present to a prosecutor for a criminal case, and the evidence must be preserved.  If you have changed anything on your computer, you have blown your case.<br>  <br>  The lawyer could press a civil case, and request discovery, and then the court could force the school to turn over their records to you.  And the school's lawyer in turn could force you to turn over your records to them.<br>  <br>  Anyway, hope you have backups.  And in the future only put simple stuff on a computer if anyone can hack into that computer.<br>  <br>  I suggest reposting this question again in the <br>  Politics and Government Category<br>  in Law & Ethics<br>  or in Law Enforcement & Police<br>  (I don't see one for Civil Lawsuits)<br>  .|`|SMNdtU0iaa	Doesn't sound like someone from the school itself did it.  Sounds like another student saw the access and took a look around.  <br>  <br>  If you grant access to your entire computer instead of to  just a shared area you run the risk of someone doing this.  You need to control access better.|`|w1J2kECdaa	They were being "secure" and making sure that you wren't putting viruses on their computer OR a virus was accessing a server and putting viruses on the system. <br>  <br>  You can't do anyything.

Secure that, I'm pretty sure it's not illegal if they were able to access it easily. Also kids can gain access to admin privileges, it's not that hard on a windows box. <br>  <br>  So basically, there is nothing legal you can do, although I would talk to the techs about this if I were you.<br>  And secure your server, that's the first thing I did when I started Apache, I recommend you do it as well.|`|4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	I doubt you can do anything. Although you've got the school's IP address you don't know which computer at the school it was that accessed your site.<br>  <br>  It could have been a tech looking to see why someone was accessing a particular IP address from within the school or it may have been another student.<br>  <br>  If you run a web server then you can expect all sorts of people looking at your files. That's what web servers do.<br>  <br>  You really do need to look at your own security. Apache is very secure but it sounds like you've opened your entire computer file system to anyone that comes along and finds your IP.<br>  <br>  Running a web server is the wrong way to keep files confidential. You should either take the files around with you on a USB drive or use a more secure way of accessing your computer.<br>  <br>  Remember though, your school may well be in it's rights to log any traffic through it's system on any port and to follow any external access it finds.

wRytd4dPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  To answer your first question, no you won't be able to just easily find files that people have sent to each other, the services you speak of will guard the privacy of their users. If you really want to find some movies the your best bet would be BitTorrent (free) or UseNet (not free), of course downloading movies from either would be illegal :), which doesn't stop millions of people from doing it :).<br>  <br>  To answer your second question, there are plenty of websites online that let you input a url to a YouTube video and they will provide a download link, this is by far the easiest way to download from youtube.

Most budget cards (<$80) like the ATI HD 3650 or the Geforce 9500GT would not require a power supply upgrade. However, should you consider the mainstream cards (>$80), you would need to upgrade power supply to ne with higher wattage.

ABI word can even import a .doc file, but not a .docx, the new 2007 document format. As for a web page generated from a document with either ABI Word or Microsoft Word, the hand coded version will bee a lot less code and a lot cleaner.

22d97ccd017e03bfc5101f4d012367b5aa	In computer networking, network address translation (NAT) is the process of modifying network address information in datagram packet headers while in transit across a traffic routing device for the purpose of remapping a given address space into another.<br>  <br>  Most often today, NAT is used in conjunction with network masquerading (or IP masquerading) which is a technique that hides an entire address space, usually consisting of private network addresses (RFC 1918), behind a single IP address in another, often public address space. This mechanism is implemented in a routing device that uses stateful translation tables to map the "hidden" addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing Internet Protocol (IP) packets on exit so that they appear to originate from the router. In the reverse communications path, responses are mapped back to the originating IP address using the rules ("state") stored in the translation tables. The translation table rules established in this fashion are flushed after a short period without new traffic refreshing their state.<br>  <br>  As described, the method only allows transit traffic through the router when it is originating in the masqueraded network, since this establishes the translation tables. However, most NAT devices today allow the network administrator to configure translation table entries for permanent use. This feature is often referred to as "static NAT" or port forwarding and allows traffic originating in the 'outside' network to reach designated hosts in the masqueraded network.<br>  <br>  Because of the popularity of this technique, see below, the term NAT has become virtually synonymous with the method of IP masquerading.<br>  <br>  Network address translation has serious consequences (see below, Drawbacks, Benefits) on the quality of Internet connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its implementation. As a result, many methods have been devised to alleviate the issues encountered. See article on NAT traversal.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	NAT is one method, and has the advantage of preventing untagged incoming packets. An outgoing packet creates an identifier for the machine it cam from, and this is attached to the reply, which is how NAT (network address translation) knows where to send the reply.|`|b6b583ac1f8fbf805cf66023cafe00cbaa	A router CAN route even if it does not have NAT. The NAT is for "address translation", not routing.|`|T5MR7fNHaa	Routing does not change the source or target IP addresses in each frame of data, the router just sends it onward in the appropriate direction.<br>  <br>  The bulk of the internet works on routing like this.<br>  <br>  NAT substitutes the from and/or to addresses within the frame, so an outgoing frame from a machine on your internal network, which starts off with a From address of 192.168.x.x is given a From address matching the public IP of your router.<br>  <br>  A reply frame coming back in has it's To address swapped to the private IP of the machine on your internal network.<br>  <br>  The NAT system keeps track of multiple connections by allocating each a 'fake' From port number on the outgoing side, and directing frames coming in to that port to the appropriate internal IP and port.<br>  <br>  NAT is normally only used to allow eg. an internal network with multiple possible IP addresses to be 'hidden' behind a single public IP address. <br>  <br>  If you want to see routing in action, try opening a command prompt and doing a traceroute to various web sites like:<br>  <br>  tracert www.yahoo.com<br>  <br>  This will list the address of each machine or router that the data has to go through to get to that destination. It can take some time to trace the whole path.|`|d22fa11eb34adb518ce9f61806a1ecb4aa	Nat means network address translation.<br>  <br>  What you described I have no Idea what you meant, but that is not nat.<br>  <br>  What Nat does is to let your private address(the ones your ISP gives you) to use a public address to browse the internet.<br>  <br>  Meaning many addresses can use a same public address to browse, they just add source port.<br>  this is also known as "PAT".<br>  <br>  Nat also have static nat, for servers and other things, but in general that is what nat does.

They better be showing you have to find gold in manure for that much jack.<br>  <br>  You would be better off spending that money on tuition at a legitimate school (community college or university). If you have a state college near you, $15K could probably pay for a few semesters worth of classes and some books.<br>  <br>  As far as certs go, let me give you some reality: find someone on line that has all the alphabet soup being their name. Then ask them what they make per year. I have no certs and can guarantee you I make double their salary. I do web application development, but I've also some system and network administration and have run an IT department for a DOD organization as a civilian. I've had exactly one certification during my 16+ year career (a MCSE for Windows NT, it expired about four years ago). <br>  <br>  Experience is the most important thing. You're not going to get it by attending some 6-month program for 15K.|`|wQt8Rklaaa	Well...<br>  <br>  The certification is defiantly something an emplyer would look for.

zI71I1Iqaa	Is your laptop still under warranty?  If it is call the Dell technical support team at: 1-800-624-9896, they will walk you through the steps of diagnosing the problem. <br>  <br>   If your laptop is out of warranty and you don't mind losing any personal data( photos, music, etc.), then try using the ghost partition that's embedded on the hard drive.  This partition allows you to restore your computer to a "factory new" state.  To do this, follow the instructions below:<br>  <br>  Use Dell PC Restore by Symantec only as the last method to restore your operating system. PC Restore<br>  <br>  restores your hard drive to the operating state it was in when you purchased the computer. Any programs<br>  <br>  or files added since you received your computer—including data files—are permanently deleted from the<br>  <br>  hard drive. Data files include documents, spreadsheets, e-mail messages, digital photos, music files, and<br>  <br>  so on. If possible, back up all data before using PC Restore.<br>  <br>  To use PC Restore:<br>  <br>  1 Turn on the computer.<br>  <br>  During the boot process, a blue bar with www.dell.com appears at the top of the screen.<br>  <br>  2 Immediately upon seeing the blue bar, press <Ctrl><F11>.<br>  <br>  If you do not press <Ctrl><F11> in time, let the computer finish starting, and then restart the<br>  <br>  computer again.<br>  <br>  NOTICE: If you do not want to proceed with PC Restore, click Reboot in the following step.<br>  <br>  3 On the next screen that appears, click Restore.<br>  <br>  4 On the next screen, click Confirm.<br>  <br>  The restore process takes approximately 6–10 minutes to complete.<br>  <br>  5 When prompted, click Finish to reboot the computer.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Do not manually shut down the computer. Click Finish and let the computer completely reboot.<br>  <br>  6 When prompted, click Yes.<br>  <br>  The computer restarts. Because the computer is restored to its original operating state, the screens that<br>  <br>  appear, such as the End User License Agreement, are the same ones that appeared the first time the<br>  <br>  computer was turned on.<br>  <br>  7 Click Next.<br>  <br>  The System Restore screen appears and the computer restarts.<br>  <br>  8 After the computer restarts, click OK.<br>  <br>  9. You will have to run Windows Update as well as Live Update for your virus protection, as these will be seriously out of date.|`|1eacd47cb685e776d991a7ddf1396d02aa	it almost sounds like your hard drive is dead.

A virus cannot affect any other computer components, BUT, it can effect the performance or those components of your computer.  So, you cannot get a virus that can destroy your graphic card, ect.  A virus can potentially mess with your device drivers, causing some computer components to malfunction, but that will not cause the component itself be malfunction, only the files that control the component.<br>  <br>  Please try to be more clear next time and please to not write in all caps.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people are suggesting you either use or get something, DO NOT TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

FDItClAUaa	no|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	never.  Memory is the only thing that will effect speed.|`|Krtx115aaa	Probably will not make it noticeably faster.<br>  <br>  Most of the time when adding software people do not configure it properly. Most software wants to call home for updates automatically (not a good idea) and it also wants to add items to the start up menu, also not a good idea. <br>  <br>  Go thru your software and check these items and correct them. Will make a big difference in the computers speed.|`|v1d9TU0yaa	Will it work? Yes. Its definately will not be faster due to the transfer rate of USB vs Sata.<br>  <br>  Reason your PC slows down is fragmentation and/or registry fragmentation.<br>  <br>  Defrag (windows sucks, theres better like O&O and perfectdisk) your HDD(s) and find a good registry optimizer and you'll speed will return.|`|lQWVZo9naa	No, your USB connection will be far slower than your IDE or SATA connection that you would have with an internal drive. External drives are great for storing files, but generally not the best for running programs off of. Especially not games.|`|w1J2kECdaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  If your computer is a fast computer, and it has USB 2.0 then maybe yes. It depends on the read/write speeds of the external hard drive. IF they are slow, and your computer is slow, then no it wont be faster.<br>  <br>  But if your computer is normal, nothing big. And the external drive is just an external drive. Then yes, it will work. You need to have windows on the laptop hard drive. Then have all your applications on the external hard drive. People like this way, because it's easier to find your stuff, and it's just more better. Your hard drive now is all fragmented. That means, half of your programs, are on one side of the hard drive and some are on the other. So, it takes time to  get the files.<br>  <br>  It;s like, if a CD had files all over. They weren't in order. <br>  <br>  More like, you downloaded a program. It has 500 files. You need to open file number 1 and then 2 and so forth. But, they are not in order. So it's going to take time for you finding #1, then finding #2.<br>  That's a good example.|`|0a5INPRuaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  Many of the Applications we install on our machines also tend to install what is called "Resident Executable files". These files will run whenever you turn on your computer and load Windows. That is one of the major reasons computers slow down.<br>  <br>  Second, and the reason you probably got this approach, is the fragmentation of your Hard Drive. The more you install and work with programs, the more information gets scattered on that hard drive. This does include the Operating System. It is a normal process and is unavoidable.<br>  <br>  If you move all your installed programs to the External Hard Drive and leave the Operating System on the C Drive, you can minimize the fragmentation of your Hard Drives and the time it takes for the Operating System to find and use the files within.<br>  <br>  Also recommended is to run a defragmentation program at least once a week. If you have no other program, the one packaged with Windows will do.

While the compression is reliable and very useful, it is not very efficent. .rar files are like .zip in a way that they compress larger amounts of data into a smaller file for easier handling and use, however .rar files are much more efficent at handling the data and compress more than a .zip file would. The best way to handle a .rar file and extract its contents is to download and install a freeware program called winrar found here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rarlabs.com/rar/wrar37b" rel="nofollow">http://rarlabs.com/rar/wrar37b</a> 4.exe|`|K24JA3ZXaa	This is a kind of file extension.<br>  When a number of files are ripped together to make a single file softwares like WinRar are used.<br>  <br>  To use a .rar file, you need to use WinRar or 7zip to unrar it.<br>  It extracts the files in the .rar archive as they were before zipping.|`|d6d529942568e28c35ea74a1add8b085aa	its a file extension.<br>  <br>  It means the file is a rar file and an archive. google winrar <br>  <br>  Winrar will open the file and then open the files inside it.
zorYTX59aa	If you want your videos to be shown at 16:9<br>  "widescreen" together with the "high quality"<br>  option, you should consider all of this:<br>  <br>  Basically, all digital video recorders (DVRs)<br>  function using 720x480 "rectangular" pixels.<br>  Computers have lots of different resolutions, <br>  but they all utilize "square" pixels. As such,<br>  Flash "encoders" can't always compensate<br>  or properly adjust for the difference. Just as<br>  important, lots of downloaders & converters <br>  render uploaded videos "fuzzy-looking" with <br>  rather large square pixels that look as if the <br>  videos were recorded using 120x90. This is<br>  particularly noticeable when there is motion <br>  in the video, or during slide show montages<br>  when still photos/images segué in between<br>  one and another. Thus, keep your videos in<br>  their original format as much as is possible.<br>  <br>  DVR's and Hypercams are not "widescreen",<br>  nor does "widescreen" mean high-quality or<br>  high-resolution. The only thing "widescreen" <br>  really means is a "more rectangular" shape.<br>  <br>  YouTube accepts file sizes up to 1,024 MB,<br>  so it is now much easier to upload larger or<br>  HQ/HD (high-quality / high-definition) videos.<br>  Everything on YouTube is, by default, "high<br>  quality"; so you shouldn't be worrying about <br>  what you have to do in order to achieve HQ. <br>  If your video is HQ enough, it will be offered<br>  on YouTube as high-quality.<br>  <br>  YouTube's old ideal at the very beginning of <br>  summer was 640x480. It seems reasonably<br>  close to the 720x480 resolution of the DVR, <br>  but YouTube really scales all of their videos <br>  "down" to 480x360 (or 640x360 widescreen, <br>  which is the new size of the player window).<br>  <br>  Because the ratio may now also be at 16:9, <br>  those types of videos can also be uploaded <br>  at 480x270, 640x360, 864x486 or the really<br>  massive 1280x720 -- which is really overkill<br>  for no practical gain. The best option surely<br>  is 640x360. Because the aspect would still <br>  be 16:9, you might get higher-quality videos <br>  by scaling down to the lower number with a <br>  video encoder that's "high-quality", such as <br>  a codec that's H.264, Divx, Xvid or MPEG-4.<br>  This would then accomplish several results:<br>  -- a smaller file (thus faster uploading)<br>  -- YouTube also has less to "process"<br>  -- you control the final scaling of pixels<br>  -- the video gets high-quality encoding.

It will tell you the hops along the path to the destination, if they are allowed to respond.  It is most often the next hop from the last device to respond to the traceroute.  If you have a router on your network and you're traceroute doesn't even get to it you have a local issue. Always check the physical layer first if you have a local issue.  Do you have link led's on ports connecting into the network.  Does you computer have an IP address on your homenetwork and a default gateway?  How about DNS entries?  Try disabling the firewall on the PC if you have one.  If this all checks out you can also try putting the cable that goes to the modem into this PC, boot it up after doing this, does it work then?

AA11703028	hi gary<br>                both the top answers are wrong,if you have a agp x 4 slot on your motherboard and use a agp x8 card the card will still work but at the x4 speed and not the full x8 speed of the card<br>                 i recently purchased a xfx geforce 7900gs which is one of the best agp cards around and on the box it stated "system requirements">" agp x4/x8 slot" and this is whats found on all agp cards,much like mixing memory speeds,when you use a pc2700 ddr ram module with a pc3200 module they will both work but the faster module will revert to the slower pc2700 speed<br>                and the same sort of theory works with agp cards,use a agp x 8 card on a agp x 4 compliant motherboard and the card will run in agp x 4 mode<br>               so whats the difference in speeds between x4 and x8 agp ?<br>                well agp x 4 has a 32bit channel operating and 66mhz which is then quad pumped to a effective 266mhz resulting in a maximum data rate of 1066 MB/s (1 GB/s)<br>                as for the agp x8 slot this also has a 32bit channel operating at 66mhz but strobes at eight times per clock cycle,which delivers 533mhz resulting in a maximum data rate of 2133 MB/s (2 GB/s)<br>                so basically your agp x4 card will run at half the speed of the agp x 8 card however the cards specifications are not affected and the core and memory speeds will be the same,its just the speed at which the agp slot communicates with the rest of the pc(memory,cpu)<br>                as for the card you have chosen,this isnt the best agp card you could get,the geforce 7900gs mentioned above has some excellent specs including a 450mhz core clock and 256mb of gddr3 memory running at 660mhz or 1320mhz ddr effective memory clock,and along with the excellent 256bit memory bus interface this equates to a healthy memory bandwidth of 42.8gb/sec<br>               also there are some excellent direct x 10 compliant agp cards and the Sapphire HD 3850 512MB GDDR3 Dual DVI HDCP HDTV( <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/143873" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebuyer.com/product/143873</a> ) is currently the fastest agp card avalible,with a massive 668mhz core clock and 512mb of gddr3 memory running at 828mhz(1656mhz ddr effective) resulting in a awesome 52.9gb/sec memory bandwidth<br>                 on the other hand the budget "Innovision GeForce 6200 256MB" is a excellent card for anyone who wants to play those old direct x 8 and 9 games,its specs are nothing special but support for pixel and shader model 3 and direct x 9.0c means this card represents great value at only     * ￡30.37ex vat<br>      * ￡34.93inc vat<br>                 any problems let me know<br>                         good luck gary !|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	no it will not work. the card requires a 8x AGP slot, your motherboard has a 4x AGP slot.<br>  <br>  It's way too expensive for what it is in todays market anyway.|`|n1cePblaaa	Your expansion slot for AGP is x4<br>  <br>  This card requries a  AGP 8x expansion slot.<br>  <br>  Believe you can run it in your PC but the card will run pretty slow as it cannot be fully utilised..<br>  <br>  <br>  Your best bet will be to search the internet using the terms "agp x4 graphics card" but will likely find a second hand one for sale as this is old technology as is your motherboard..<br>  <br>  This would suit if your willing to buy 2nd hand<br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Sapphire-Radeon-X1650-512-MB-AGP-x4-x8-Graphics-Card_W0QQitemZ330311515744QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_WSJL_Wholesale_GL?hash=item330311515744&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1690%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Sapphire-Radeon-X1...</a>|`|H3Va1OKqaa	No.

isadV8SHaa	You can not change hadware while the computer is hibernating.  If you want to remove hardware you must turn the machine completely off.<br>  <br>  When a machine is put into hibernation, it assumes that everything will be exactly the same when It wakes up.  That is what allows a hibernated computer to start up so quickly.  It does not have to load anything new, or fresh, it just reloads the memory with the exact information that was in it when it was hibernated.<br>  <br>  When a machine is turned off, it doesn't assume anything.  It starts with completely empty memory and reloads all drivers and startup programs it finds necessary.  That is why it takes longer to start up a machine that is off.
jxVXK3yUaa	Hi, The only way I know of getting rid of these messages is to click on the start menu, and then on your user account picture to open up the user controls.  If this isn't possible, open up control panel and then user accounts.  <br>  In your user section, there should be the option to associate/dissociate your .NET Passport.  This is what you need to deactivate.<br>  <br>  Sorry i haven't given exact and detailed instructions but i am using my Vista PC today and can't remember the exact wording XP uses.<br>  Hope this helps :D !|`|WnbcxKkZaa	Usually, if u have outlook or thunderbird or something similar configured to be your default email client and it download msgs that you havent checked on your COMPUTER, then it will say that, even if you checked it in your email.

The other poster says it's ok to access a neighbor's wifi if it is not PW protected...but that is incorrect.<br>  <br>  Just as entering a home or business without the owner's permission is considered trespassing (even if the doors are unlocked), likewise accessing wireless Internet connections (even open access ones) can be considered an illegal activity. At a minimum, obtain consent from the operator of any Wi-Fi access point before using their service. <br>  <br>  You must have the permission of the owner to access their network, and even then it may not be legal if the ISP does not allow it.<br>  <br>  Is it worth it?  Read the story below|`|Lh4S3q53aa	Of course it can.   Any wireless device can be programed to pick up just about any wireless signal.   Commercial wireless cards and modems will pick up about 99% of all other commercial wireless devices.    Hell, my iphone picks up every wifi network i come close to.  <br>  <br>  Most wifi networks will have a password but every once in a while you'll get lucky and find one that isnt password protected.   And the above info is wrong.   It is not illegal to access a wireless network that does not have a PW.   However, if you crack the PW to get onto the network then yes, it would be illegal.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesn’t seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode. <br>  <br>  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.  <br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.<br>  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.<br>  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  <br>  6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.<br>  <br>  Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

After these pictures are set(-28%,-38% etc.), a window.listener() Javascript function checks the mouse movements. For example, if the mouse is moved left, the background position of each layer/div is increased or decreased using Javascript and this as a whole creates the illusion that you see.<br>  You can always use Microsft's MSDN online library to find the objects and methods you need.

If the document is biggerr than the size of your screen, make multiple screenshots of it then stitch them together in your graphics program.<br>  <br>  To take a screenshot, open your graphics program (for example Photoshop Elements or GIMP) and then minimise it so you can see your document on screen. Now click the [PrnScrn] button on your keyboard (it might not say that in your language, but it is usually the button to the right of your F12 key on standard keyboards).

It matters. If you are buying for desktop it will probably have to be ddr or ddr2 kind. As for the speed. I would recommend 800. Just ask the store for ddr2 800 ram.

Hackers will use this critical security oversight to trick victims into allowing their garbage to be installed, with innocent looking (often mimmicing legit window notices) 'click to view' or 'you must allow Active X to view this content' or 'install the latest Java here' to that end.<br>  <br>  2)  Requesting files from Peer-2-Peer servers<br>       Because they use multiple 'peer contributors' to feed bits & parts of a requested file (music, movies, etc.) back to you, there can never be any kind of certainty about the status of the sender's file.<br>  Whatever they have =  you get: malevolent or not.<br>    <br>  Once downloaded to your machine, all bets are off about it's safety to open, transfer, use or re-send; and size of a file has little bearing on what it may or may not contain; scanned or otherwise.<br>  <br>  Use @ your own peril...<br>  <br>  3)  Relying on single malware defense method<br>      Many folks assume they are immune to infections when they have a 'Security Suite' (like McAffe, or Norton, etc.) and engage in risky behavior like going to known 'dark side' sites, or porn sites.  Security must be done in layers; user interaction with the system; and current threat landscape awareness.<br>  Because the Internet is so fluid, it evolves and changes almost hourly, and all users must stay current with all defense measures...it's just the way it is. <br>  <br>  *Prime Defense countermeasures*<br>  1) Use a "Limited" account to surf the Net<br>  2) Use Firefox, with "NoScript" add-on.|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	it's pretty darn safe

As far as that goes, we put passwords on the comps and don't let her on unsupervised, but if she cares enough to work around that and get one anyway, then she's smart enough to know what she's dealing with as far as I'm concerned.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be Mr. Drill Sergeant (my oldest gets really upset when I go digging through her "personal" life, but she never flat out says no...  she knows I'm going to look and ask, and that's enough.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

wRytd4dPaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Since you've restarted the computer multiple types and the problem still persists, it is unlikely to be just a harmless situation. One of 2 things has happened:<br>  <br>  1. You have previously tried to install a program e.g. Norton and it has a multistage install process (requires a restart to complete installation). This has left an entry in your registry or something similar on the file system, but the installation did not complete. Every time you try to install the same piece of software, it says that a previous installation is still in progress. You need to go to the task manager and kill the process that is running (Ctrl+Alt+Del and find the name that looks similar to the program you're trying to install and attempt to kill it).<br>  <br>  2. You have a virus/worm/malicious adware on your system. The safest thing to do would be to reinstall windows completely. However, if that is not an option then you can do several things.<br>   - download AdAware, run it and follow instructions (this will clean most adware)<br>   - download SpyBot Search and Destroy (this will clean the rest of the spyware)<br>   - download AVG antivirus, install it and run it (this should take care of all viruses)|`|zokJMPBAaa	download ccleaner updated to the latest version,that should clean out that file thats trying to download|`|2yuVGCL7aa	this may be an error or a virus read all suggestions<br>  <br>  you can try to disable it with task manager<br>  <br>  you can fix this by using tune up utillities (not tried it but this may work) also there is one more lots of people are suggesting is ccleaner <br>  <br>  if worst comes to worst this may be a virus that is watching you and it is running in an install kind of mode to keep you from adding security and destroying it in which case you would have to manually delete it in which you would have to use a large amount of advanced code<br>  <br>  other alternatives include backing up and reinstalling windows to delete it (see risky files below and dont backup anything like that)<br>  <br>  kinds of programs that may have injected this <br>  anything porn like virtualgirl3d<br>  shopping adware such as zango<br>  gathered while torrent downloading <br>  and much more chances are if its not normal its a risk be careful about what you download <br>  <br>  p.s. good luck i hope this works out for you without having to reinstall windows|`|cc50e303608b94019afecf4e57465dc2aa	try to use the task manager by pressing ctrl+alt+delete.<br>  see if there are any setup programs in the "processes" tab.<br>  NOTE: end processes only under your username, never cancel a process under the "system" and "local/network service" names.

Why not just go buy a book on the subject read the whole thing and understand it?  because you are lazy and want to use the internet.  Do me a favor, Go google something in the scientific world, it comes up with A LOT of stuff to sift through to find out one thing.  One of the best examples is when you search something like Restriction Endonuclease, it gives you a ton of scientific papers about how they used one to do some experiment.  It gets really old.  This is a great tool for homework help, and learning without wasting the time in reading a book.  You are right it might be laziness but using Google is the same thing just less lazy, it might be ignorance but if you ignore the tool that is Yahoo Answers or Yahoo itself your ignoring another powerhouse of a search engine yourself, and it is definitely not stupid to ask a question, there are no stupid questions only stupid people asking questions who want to be educated and be smart!|`|YTIDE8Evaa	I totally agree with you most of the times.

They come full loaded and are a fraction of the price of most known brands.<br>  You can run games and any high-end software on these ACERS. We program with them and run 24/7 without closing them. The battery pack is very solid and we never had a glitch and we keep the charger on all the time.<br>  <br>  Toshiba Satellite break down due to overheating which is why we switched to Acer.  Compaq is another good Laptop with a built-in recovery partition which is neat.<br>  You do not need any windows soince it is built on a small partition and you can restore factory settings by holding the F11 key and the computer restores itself automatically.<br>  This is a nice feature with all the various running around.|`|mwmJJz5Uaa	If you want personalized, reliable and quick advice, you should check out ProCompare.

Compare said list against the mac addresses of your own computers and you will find out the mac address of the person who shouldn't be there.<br>  <br>  Even better, set up mac filtering on the device.  Also, make sure you are using wpa2 (or wpa if the device isn't new enough) with a strong passphrase (ie. 16 or more characters, no words from the dictionary, letters, numbers and some punctuation).|`|b6c4af7d411b31b81b993c41a9db5e1baa	<a href="http://www.mywifizone.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mywifizone.com/</a><br>  <br>  this works great.

FjCcc561aa	Since this setup uses one FTP account to create user home directories and upload files, a compromise to this FTP user would cause the attacker to gain access to all FTP user home directories. I guess it just depends on how much you trust the DefaultRoot directive in Proftpd. I run Proftpd in its own chroot environment ( <a href="http://jim.centerfuse.net/projects/proftpd_chroot/" rel="nofollow">http://jim.centerfuse.net/projects/proft...</a> ) in addition to using DefaultRoot, so I'm used to feeling pretty safe with my Proftpd install. Anyway, here's how I did the install/configuration<br>  <br>  1. install proftpd-mysql from the ports with WITH_QUOTA set:<br>  <br>  cd /usr/ports/ftp/proftpd-mysql/<br>  env WITH_QUOTA=yes make<br>  env WITH_QUOTA=yes make install<br>  <br>  2. Add the global proftpd user & Proftpd group to your system.<br>  <br>  I used uid & gid 5500 simply because that's what was used at one of the sites I was referencing (listed below).<br>  <br>  pw groupadd -n Proftpd -g 5500<br>  pw useradd proftpd -u 5500 -g Proftpd -s /sbin/nologin -d /dev/null -c "Proftpd User"<br>  <br>  3. Create the mySQL database<br>  <br>  create database proftpd;<br>  grant all on proftpd.* to 'proftpd'@'localhost' identified by 'password'<br>  <br>  ( change 'password' to something secret! )<br>  <br>  4. Create the mySQL tables for the users & quota<br>  <br>  create table proftpdUsers (<br>  <br>  sqlUID int unsigned auto_increment not null,<br>  userName varchar(30) not null unique,<br>  passwd varchar(80) not null,<br>  uid int unsigned not null unique,<br>  gid int unsigned not null,<br>  homedir tinytext,<br>  shell tinytext,<br>  primary key(sqlUID)<br>  <br>  ) ;<br>  <br>  create table proftpdGroups (<br>  <br>  sqlGID int unsigned auto_increment not null,<br>  groupName varchar(30) not null unique,<br>  gid int unsigned not null unique,<br>  members tinytext,<br>  primary key(sqlGID)<br>  );<br>  <br>  CREATE TABLE proftpdQuotaLimits (<br>  name VARCHAR(30),<br>  quota_type ENUM("user", "group", "class", "all") NOT NULL,<br>  per_session ENUM("false", "true") NOT NULL,<br>  limit_type ENUM("soft", "hard") NOT NULL,<br>  bytes_in_avail FLOAT NOT NULL,<br>  bytes_out_avail FLOAT NOT NULL,<br>  bytes_xfer_avail FLOAT NOT NULL,<br>  files_in_avail INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<br>  files_out_avail INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<br>  files_xfer_avail INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL<br>  );<br>  <br>  <br>  CREATE TABLE proftpdQuotaTallies (<br>  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,<br>  quota_type ENUM("user", "group", "class", "all") NOT NULL,<br>  bytes_in_used FLOAT NOT NULL,<br>  bytes_out_used FLOAT NOT NULL,<br>  bytes_xfer_used FLOAT NOT NULL,<br>  files_in_used INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<br>  files_out_used INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<br>  files_xfer_used INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL<br>  );<br>  <br>  5. Add a test user to the proftpd database<br>  <br>  (assumes /home/ftp is where you keep your ftp users. Otherwise, change the homedir location).

It works on DivX too<br>  <br>  Porn away!|`|dOMzkQIraa	It's not the creation of the SMV that needs the codecs. It's the conversion from any other source that needs the codec.<br>  <br>  Youtube uses FLV, which is a Flash movie file.

HdwKXp61aa	apple store in person. it gives you more options if you need to exchange it etc, and its easier to sort it out face to face.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i dont know who gave the guy the thumbs down. That's the best advice you are going to get. That's a 10 percent discount when you claim student. And apples are pretty expensive. Id get one from the store. You might find something in there you like. I live in north dakota and i miss the apple store. I have a pc now and it sucks compared to apple. Apple was easy to work with. And now you can petition the hard drives to do windows things. Go to the store, sometimes they have bundle deals and your service is much better. I miss looking at all the 30 inch screens they had. They also have free training sessions on their software. Doesn't cost you a thing.<br>  <br>  If you are anywhere near an apple store. I would go down there.|`|dUqgiKBPaa	i went thru my college and got a 10% discount. price search first! and see what kind of free things you get and see what is more important. i got 10% discount, a free ipod and a free printer with mine..check out the deals|`|Ewp79kMIaa	I would buy it at Best Buy! That's where I got mine, plus you can use your rewards cards there, whereas at the Apple Store, they're going to nickle and dime you for everything. But, if it comes down to it, I would buy it at the Apple Store over macwarehouse, because it's more reliable. You can also get the education discount at Best Buy. Just tell them to go to Apple's website, enter your college, and see what your personal discount is. They are obligated to honor it. If they say they can't I would ask to see the manager, because I got the education discount on mine there. You can also get a warranty at Best Buy, because Geek Squad honors Macs|`|bBsO0W3raa	Apple Store. With the warranty given by the apple store they will take it back if there is any other problems and fix it.|`|LWtz8cGsaa	Hmm, doesn't really mater, walk to the store, exercise is good 4 u.:p|`|HRJDrnBRaa	apple store and then claim the student discount|`|dPk7dr7laa	Do your research. Search online for the best deal you can find and see if there is free shipping to a store. (Radioshack.com does free shipping if you have it delivered to the closest store to you and you pick it up there ) as well, see what the APPLE store is selling it for and see what is the better deal. You can get these just about anywhere even Ebay. Just do the research and be sure to see which stores will offer free shipping to a local store for pick-up. That is your best deal! Good luck!|`|27yV9WZ0aa	The Apple store. Customer service is excellent. Don't be afraid to buy online at the Apple store also. <br>  If your looking to save some money you can always buy a cheap macbook online if you search hard enough.  Macbookwatch.com has some great prices. They are an eBay partner so you would have to set up an eBay account but atleast it's trustworthy and safe.|`|55t9z5maaa	online because it is cheaper if you buy it online they give you a discount for visiting the apple website and it is free for shipping and handiling|`|1AJQJ7Gjaa	if thers one near you, go to a store to get upfront questions. if u live farther away or in like the Montana area go with online because it is going to be to far|`|z7AiPQcaaa	Apple Store!|`|cc50e303608b94019afecf4e57465dc2aa	apple store. online shopping has a shipping fee so the price is higher than buying in the store.|`|7NjNW3ITaa	Iam kinda old school so i would buy it at an apple istore. But you would probably get better deals online.|`|GrgIB8gzaa	Id do some research online, get all your facts and specs, and with the information you've gathered, go the the apple store and talk to a sales person and get a second opinion
