I stored most of my clothes in plastic garbage bags for a year and upon taking them out I'm deathly allergic, probably due to a little bit of mold/mildew that accumulated in the bag. So if I add a bit of non-chlorine bleach to the load, are my clothes going to look like crap after?       I've already tried washing some of them 3 times on the super duty cycle on the machine and although better, I'm still sneezing a little while wearing them.       Thanks
20090203104942AAD32iA	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Dawn Dishwashing Liquid with Bleach Alternative - just as good?	I know "bleach alternative" usually refers to Oxygen Bleaches - but when washing dishes does this really sanitize as well as chlorine bleach does?      I have noticed that our local health department says NOT to use oxygen bleaches for sanitizing, only chlorine based bleach or other chemical sanitizers.      So - is this just a sales ploy since Oxy bleach and Bleach Alternative are big buzz-words right now?  Or does it actually do something.  Do I have to let the dishes soak in order to get the effect?        The label and their website is pretty much silent on these issues.

20090222210613AA9J09b	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Do you think this is fair? What would you do if this was your home?	(I also asked this question in the law & government section)         In our city Southern California Edison (Power Company) proposed to run 200ft 500kw lines through a residential area on a easement that is 150 feet wide. They call it the Tehachapi project.      These power lines will be within 40-75ft of residential homes. I believe about 1500 homes will be impacted by the project.       Please read more before responding :  http://www.chinohills.org/index.asp?nid=...     http://www.saynotopowerlines.org/       There are laws that require that power lines are 350ft away from schools, but I guess this doesn't apply to residential homes.       The school bus stop is right under these power lines. They can move the bus stop, but can they move my children's bedrooms??       Alternative routes have been offered and deemed acceptable. The alternative routes go through unused Aero jet land skirt a State Park.      The CPUC (California Public Utilities Commission) announced that it would be better to run these lines right through our neighborhood!!               Additional Details   I wish that it was easy to say that EMFs don't hurt, but enough people believe that they do...it can drop our property value.       Just as you say that there is no proof that they don't hurt, there is still the issue that our easement is only 150 ft wide, the tower again is 200ft tall.. The tower is placed on the center of the easement, that center is only 75feet away. If anything happens to the lines or towers...where are they going to land?

Before we left we made sure to take out all the trash, any bad food, vacuum, and anything else that might attract bugs (because occasionally we get an ant problem). Well we came back and there are TONS of flies. They're not the rainbow colored ones (the kind that eat feces and dead animals and such) they're just the ordinary house fly.      They're not very smart either. They let you get really close so it makes them easy to swat. But no matter when we think we get the last one, we find more flying around. Also, they seem to be attracted to light. It's strange. But they're always flying around my desk lamp, the lights above the head board on the bed, the living room lamp. almost like they're moths. We can't figure out what is causing all of them and we're starting to go insane. We're heading to the store right now to buy some fly paper. Please, anymore suggestions on where they're coming from or how to kill them will be GREATLY appreciated!

Their is stamp on the underside depicting a covered wagon with two oxen pulling it, and a man in the front with a rifle. I can only read half of it saying Assett furniture. Can anyone tell the age and any info on the maker, and if its worth anything? I was told its probably from the 70's.      The green couch is pretty long ( about 8 1/2 ft. long), but both can be moved separately. It has metal zippers in the back of the cushions so you can take the fabric of, and the label says the contents of the couch if that helps. It is in pretty good condition but just needs new foam cushioning and their is a large tear on the underside of the one cushion. My husband wants to get rid of them because he thinks they are falling apart and is too big to move, but it is solid and nothing is wrong with it. Can anyone identify the time era of it, or if its worth anything?

20090222161642AAA9XzS	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Bathroom Leak.  Is it coming from the vent?	My bathroom just started leak.   A drop every second.  I called the fire dept. to ask for recommendation.  they came over and  looked around.  they suggested thah I turn off the circuit-breaker.  One of them mentioned that the water may be coming from the vent which is located about the bathroom. When they left, I went up on the roof and I placed a bucket on the top of the vent.  After that the amount of water is dripping lesser and lesser.   Is there anything such as Vent Guard??
