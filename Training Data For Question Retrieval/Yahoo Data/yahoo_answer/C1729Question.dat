Tel Aviv: La Policía frustró ayer un ataque terrorista en la estación central de buses   Las fuerzas de seguridad frustraron un atentado terrorista a gran escala que intentaba atacar las instalaciones de la estación central de autobuses de Tel Aviv. La Yihad Islámica se adjudicó el fallido ataque.   La Policía arrestó a un palestino y a varias personas más en una vivienda de Bat Iam luego de recibir informaciones de Inteligencia.   Tras el arresto, los detenidos guiaron a los investigadores a Rishon Letzion donde habían escondido un bolso lleno de explosivos. Fuentes policiales indicaron que el palestino capturado confesó la intención de atacar el centro neurálgico de la ciudad.   Según fuentes de seguridad, el ataque debería haber tenido lugar en la tarde del martes pero pero por razones desconocidas los responsables escondieron el bolso en Rishon Letzion y regresaron a Bat Iam.   Luego del operativo, la Policía redujo el nivel de alerta en el área de Tel Aviv, que había sido elevado.

I feel sorry with all my heart that she has to go through such a terrible terminal illness knowing that she will no longer be alive. But dont you think that every pesron with terminal illness deserves to get the same treatment. Why is she different from others, We have so many excellent and kind people in this world who cannot afford to pay for their treatment but Jade gets everything she wants. My uncle and my grandparents died from cancer, my granddad died in front of me when i was 13, it was terriblt, i will never forget it. My granddad served his country in World War but when he was diagnosed with cancer noone wanted to know, he had very little help. Is it fair or unfair. I think if one person gets all attention then there should be some sort of way of making other special too, others who might have to go through those illnesses on their own. Thank you for opinion!

The joke about three irish men jumping off a cliff was as most see harmless and trying to make people smile.

Now, the story says, that he may not be the Daddy, since the girl, 15 was sleeping with 5 other guys at the time... And, it seems that the parents of both of these obviously children are not concerned with them having sex or kids... What is wrong with this picture? This is beyond wrong?

The claims of WMDs were shown to be wrong, and i refuse to accept that it was a "mistake" or they "vanished overnight", and the UN envoys found none themselves.      Was it really all about the Oil? Surely there must be something else?      I know Saddam Hussein killed a lot of Iraqi civilians, but the west armed him and supplied him with intel during his war (which was encouraged by the west) with Iran.      Since 2002 more Iraqis have died since the coalitions entry into Iraq than Saddam was ever held responsible for, and the country is in such a mess, economically, socially...      So my question is, why did the US and UK (and poland etc) invade Iraq?

LONDON: What started as just an argument about skinny models on the ramps of New York and Milan has now spread to the world of pedigree dogs. Yes, the 'Size Zero' row has reached canine shows. Experts have claimed that many dog owners are denying their pets proper food and water in order to win competitions - in fact, canines are "starved" to meet strict weight limits at shows, 'The Sunday Telegraph' reported.    According to Andrew Brace, a dog show judge, three quarters of the Miniature Dacshunds at a recent championship in Bridgend, Wales, were "far too thin for their frames". "I am well aware of the strength of feeling of the Miniature people about the need to maintain the scales, but I believe that this is not helping the breed one bit," he wrote in the 'Dog World' magazine.    Agreed expert Jemima Harrison, the producer of a BBC documentary which in 2008 exposed breeding techniques which led to genetic illnesses that affect pedigree dogs: "This is 'Size Zero' for dogs, I am inundated with owners and judges who say they are seeing dehydrated or malnourished dogs on the scales, all for the sake of a rosette. It sounds funny to think of dogs having the same issues as fashion models but it is a serious welfare issue. For these owners, it is all about winning and nothing else."        http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World...

Looking at Indians, taking the media for example....   years back the westerner who made the movie Gandhi made a multi millions and awards after awards, but it is a movie made by a white man, if the same movie were to have made by an Indian, it is the flop of the year. Taking movies like "Hey Ram" for example , a film by Bharath Shah and Kamalahaasan, where was the reach of such movies? Now Slumdog Millionaire, another movie made by a white man, we Indians are so over excited, as if something impossible is acheived.

20090222121406AAAIyEo	News & Events;Current Events	Obama tops list of 10 most admired people?	So on AOL today it looks like President Obama made the #1 on the list of America's top 10 most admired people. Coming in right before Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King Jr, Abe Lincoln, even Mother Theresa.   I don't know about you, but i think its rather strange how a man who hasn't done anything for our country (yet) came in #1 place, while others who have been around along time and gained respect trailed behind.    Am i the only one this seems kind of odd to?   I'd like to hear your voice on this...all opinions welcome.

20090222133913AA0WvOq	News & Events;Current Events	Why would a surrogate mother want to keep a baby besides the money?	I read this article on a surrogate mother wanting to keep her baby instead of giving it to the family that actually hired her to be their surrogate mother. I'm not trying to take sides on that if shes wrong for having such intense feelings on keeping the baby or if she should give it away. I just don't understand why someone would want to be a surrogate mother in the first place. Instead of the money, what else is there, if so an advantage, on being a surrogate mother. What's the psychological thinking of these women to be a surrogate because I clearly don't understand why they would try to put themselves in that kind of a situation because if I were in that situation I would be careful not too have a bond with it because in the end of the day I made a contract.      Can anyone try to help me understand?      This is the link to the article if anyone wants to read it.       http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.ht...

I'm having a difficult time understanding the major differences between the Hutu and the Tutsi forces in Rwanda, and what they were mainly fighting for.      I know there's no "good guy" and "bad guy" now, but if anyone could explain some more about the two groups, it would be greatly appreciated (not just what I can google/Wikipedia, because that isn't really helping).

20090222142303AAKFC81	News & Events;Current Events	Jade Goody - Why the huge pity?	I mean there are people I know who live with cancer, are at risk to cancer and have died of cancer one of which was my uncle. And they all handled it with a whole lot more dignity than she did.       The only good thing that has came out of her in my view is promoting awareness.      I suppose part of my harsh view is my zero tolerance of racists approach and if that makes me a bad person then im a bad person.      But really why the huge pity here.

"DIME bombs blast a superheated "micro-shrapnel" of powdered heavy metal tungsten alloy (HMTA). Studies indicate that HMTA embedded in the body disrupts biochemistry and rapidly causes cancer. Like depleted uranium (DU), HMTA is genotoxic—it is capable of inflicting genetic mutations."    http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27a...       While White Phosphorus is banned as a weapon against civilians areas cause it BURNS ppl ALIVE & penetrate to the bones & POISON the body???    http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/wo...       If israeli is claiming that its fight was a reply to Hamas rockets ,which is very small conventional rockets,why then using baned weapons like DIME bomb & White Phosphorus ???   Doesn't that mean that israel committed hundreds of WAR CRIMES in Gaza & SHOULD be severely punished for it?
