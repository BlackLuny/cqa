I wanted to start my 7 1/2 month old on a sippy cup. I assume you put in formula since he's too young to need water. When does he get the cup? While he's eating regular food? It is meant to be more of a beverage as opposed to a meal replacement? When do you take away the bottle completely? Do you still give a bottle before bedtime as part of the routine? TIA!

20090203114427AAj9N7n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I be worried- 7 wk old sleeping WAY more than usual today.?	My 7 week old son has been on a fairly regular schedule for the past few weeks and he just started sleeping REALLY well at night a few nights ago.  (Including last night.)        Today we woke up around 8:30 and he has been so sleepy all day.  He will wake for about 20 min to eat, and then falls right back to sleep.  I have tried to stimulate him here and there while he's awake to keep him up, but to no avail!        As a first time mom, I'm sure a lot of you can relate to worrying about everything- so I was wondering if something is wrong, or maybe a growth spurt?!  Like I said- he slept really well last night.

Your mom encouraged another one of her daughters to get pregnant at 15 to get her out of the house. She tried to put her adolescent daughter on a sleezy talk show to discuss her unfortunate sexual abuse on national tv. Three of her adult children have dropped out of high school with her permission and gotten pregnant or gotten someone pregnant before reaching adulthood, and the only one who hasnt was raised by another woman. What would you do if you had two younger siblings (adolescents) still living with her? Would you be concerned for your siblings?

20090203115600AAEQuaI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How should I introduce my son to better hobbies? ?	My son (15) lives with his mother and I see him once or twice a month. I see how my wife has influenced him to become the way he is. Instead of football, basket or hunting, he is taking classical singing lessons. When he was younger I took him out to ball games and I often took him out hunting. When I ask him why he isn't interested in sports now he tells me that "he just hasn't got any interest". He told me he had been performing at his school and that he wanted to do something in the future with his singing. He actually sang for me in my house. He was good and he could sing high notes, but I think his voice was way too high for a man. I told him he sounded like a castrato. I am used to guys with lower voices. I am worried that he will become a castrato if he doesn't stop singing. He also talks in a high voice. I don't want him becoming gay. Other interests he has got are writing poetry, stargazing and Harry Potter. Why can't he have more male interests like sports, hunting or computers?    I talked with my ex-wife yesterday and she got angry in me for calling my son a "castrato". Why shouldn't I worry? Is singing too much dangerous for a man during puberty?    And my son has diabetes 1. He is eating loads of sweets. Why can't he control his diet more instead of using insulin?

20090203115344AAAbnUC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im trying to get my childs father involved!!!?	I found out that I was pregnant in december after talking to this guy for about a month in a half and then hooking up with him.  Before I got pregnant we would hang out with each other and he would be the most laid back person.  When I told him I was pregnant he became this whole other person, and by that time his job had moved his to Las Vegas..I was debating abortion, but decided agaist it...I want to give my child a chance. Anyways, everytime I contact him through his e-mail he responds with an attittude, and I have been nothing but nice to him...and now he says that he is going to play basketball over-seas to make money to pay off loans...he is a 26 year old man that says he is not ready to be a father, but we were both adult to know what the possible outcomes of not using protection...I have even emailed him ultrasounds pics to hopefully have a change of heart and that he will actullay want to be in our baby's life....how can I reason or convince him that I just want him to be apart of his child's life. My best friend tells me that he is scared right now and that he will come around once the baby is born.  I'm really trying to be patient with him but it seems that I will possibly have to put him on child support if he continues to act the way he does...which is he can have all the fun he wants and not give a damn that he has a child on the way
20090203115542AA70WP3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Has any one used the toys r us Bruin Ear themometer I bought one but it seems so in accurate ?	I purchase a bruin ear thermometer from toys r us a couple of weeks ago. My 2 1/2 year old has become ill tonight and so used it for the first time to take his temperature. It kept giving out bizzar readings. I finally got it to work and it said his temperature was 37.9. He feels like he is burning up though. I decided to get my old digital thermometer out to double check. its the type that you put in mouth or under arm. I put it under my sons arm and his temperature with that thermometer was 39. thats a big difference. Im not sure which thermometer to believe. My old digital thermometer has always seemed accurate before. I used to have a ear thermometer before a braun one but it got broken and so bought this bruin one as a replacement. I had always found my old braun ear thermometer very accurate.  Do you think the bruin themometer I have purchased is faulty. Has any one else used this type of thermometer from toys r us.  which reading do you think is right any advice would be much appreciated

20090203120758AAZ4sZH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do i handle this...?	Okay so this is why im asking because i tend to go over board when it comes to my son im a BIG worry wart. My son is 22 months old.So here it goes.    Friday the 23rd my son started running a fever. it was at 101.6 then i gave him motrin.      Saturday the 24 he had a slight fever of about 100.7.      Sunday 25 no fever but he ended up being up half the night crying and then got a runny nose and red itchy eyes.      Monday 26 I called his doctor and he got an appoitnment for tuesday the 27th.   So tuesday the doctor said he had a sinus infection and put him on antibotics.    He did great all the way up intill this sunday which was the 1st. Sunday night when it came for dinner time he barley ate his dinner. Well i brushed it off thought maybe he was still full from his snack.   Well then monday he barley ate anything, and he was fussy all day long. he was trying to fall asleep on the couch after only being up from his nap for an hour. So this morning i call his dr.s office. My husband is military so we go threw base pediatrics, and i hate it. I told them what was going on and they said well he probably is just going threw a phase. I know my son and he isnt going threw a phase where he doesnt want to eat, my son is a little piggy he would eat all day if you let him. So then they tell me he probably just has the stomach flu. I had to fight to get an appoitment which i find some BS. So he has an apointment tomorrow. I fed him lunch today and the only thing he would eat was crakers. I made him chicken noodle soup and fruit and he wouldnt eat it he would only eat the crakers. My mother in law is worried because he was sweating without any activity. He was just laying on the couch sweating.    So now that i have giving the back ground info (sorry so long) here is my questions:      What do you think i should do since he isnt eating, anything i can try?      Do you think i should get him a new doctor of base since i am always having to fight to get him an appointment?      We also have an urgent care place of base that i can take him to but i have to call and get the okay from tri care to take him there, do you think i should take him there and say screw the doctors?      im completley at a lose here i have never had to worry about my son not eatting he always has eaten when he was sick, so if you where in my shoes what would you do?

20090203121122AAigtpG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible that I am pregnant?	It's a somewhat long story, but, I was pregnant before, but I had what i thought was a miscarriage. I was bleeding heavier than I ever have, and the pain was so terrible I almost had to go to the Hospital. And right after wards, all my pregnancy symptoms went away. But now, my stomach is getting bigger, and normally you all would say i'm gaining weight. But I barely eat. I'm always busy and active. And i've been having weird cravings lately, I've been getting sick again, and my mood is completely different, and my chest seems to be getting bigger, and it's not extremely sensitive, but it's sensitive. Normally, I'd think I was pregnant, but i've been getting my periods. My friends think the bleeding and pain could have been from being pregnant with twins or something. And some also think i was pregnant with twins, and i miscarried one of them. I haven't had sex recently, and if i tell my parents, they're going to think that I had a guy over when they were at the hospital with my brother. Any ideas of what to do? I can't go out and by a test so, I am completely stuck at this point. I don't know what to do. Cause I have read and been told of women who have their period while being pregnant, it's rare but it happens.

This guy, my good friend I take trig. with at school just msgd me over msn      He basically just asked if he could have sex with me at his friend's party next weekend.      I think I like him, like realllly like him. I have for a while.   He is kind of a player, and he's even been in jail but more importantly he's a meth addict and last year he got my sister friend pregnant, but then she killed herself..so yes.      I've known him for six years and we've been friends for three of them.   I just really don't want to stuff things up with him   like if I sleep with him will I get all emotionally attached? What if I'm too drunk to notice he maybe didnt bring protection and I get knocked up like my sister did?      I know we have a fukced up relationship and everything, but yeah.

Hi there my little one was born on November 9th last year and I sent in my claim form for child benefit the middle of December I enclosed my bank details as requested and thought that would be it! a couple of weeks later I received a form asking for my bank details yet again which I filled out and sent back but still no money I have called them on numerous occasions but still no joy ! am just told that they have a backlog and they would sort it as soon as possible but they still did not have my bank details on the system and could not take it over the phone! was told that the forms were still in the system and that this would be rectified as soon as possible!      Last week....bearing in mind it is now February they still had not paid any money into my account so I called them again and was told they could now take my account details over the phone and that they would write to me when the claim was sorted and that the letter would give a date as to when I would have the money in my account!      Has anyone else had this probelm with the child benefit agency ?? I dont know if its worth me calling them every day but I have e mailed them, phoned them etc over the last couple of weeks and have got no where ! one of the people I spoke to was very rude and just kept on repeating well we have a backlog you know !      Any answers appreciated as long as they are nice.      Thanks
20090221031043AA0FvpW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Why is my four year old been coughing for two hours straight?	She just started coughing this morning when she woke up. Constant, two cough, then she's swallow and then a few seconds later cough one or two more times. I told her teacher if she continues to call me, but she never did. Then about two hours after she got home, same thing for about another hour or so. I went to the store to buy her tylenol cough & running nose. It calmed down. and now it's 5am and she's been coughing since before 4am.    I know sometimes a cough is a cough, but what else can I do for her. She hasn't been sleeping well.   Another thing is my mom has had a cough, supposedly due to allergies, and my daughter slept in her bed the other night, are allergies contagious? And same thing, when my mom starts coughing she doesn't stop until she almost has to throw up! which is so annoying.   Please help.

20090221041640AAqHzsN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Full of anxiety and worry...terrified of loosing my baby.?	Hiya all,      I have been panicking and worrying all the way through my pregnancy. My reasons for all this worry is because i have lost identical twin boys at 16 weeks, i had a mmc at 12 weeks and 2 more mc at 6/7 weeks. I know i am so paranoid that i am going to loose my baby but i just don't know how to stop it.      I kept saying that i would stop worrying after my 20 week scan....so i had my 20 week scan on Wednesday (18th) and found out that we are having a healthy baby boy.       I was on cloud 9 for the rest of the day but then the very next day all my worries have come back! I can feel my baby kick now but if i haven't felt him kick for a while then i worry. I even have a doppler and always find the heartbeat straight away when i use it but it still doesn't ease my worries.      I just need some advice on how to relax as this paranoid me is driving me crazy. I even considered counselling but it's not for me.      I am even too scared to start buying things or even look at baby items just incase it gives me bad luck!!       Please no nasty answers...just some advice. I really want my baby and i can't even bare to think about what loosing my baby would do to me now.      Thank you and sorry for the long post.      Louise 21 weeks pregnant xx

The doctor said I don't need to call until they're 5 min's apart for 2 hours straight but with each contraction I have to breathe heavily and brace myself. If these contractions aren't helping me dilate I wish they'd just go away!

Then about half an hour later he put himself back inside me and didn't come, then we went to sleep.      The first day of my last period was the 4th Feb and I don't know how long my cycles are.

[I'm 16 from the UK it's legal but I don't want them to know]   Will the morning-after pill be free?   Do I have to talk to the doctor about it or can I just take it and get out of there?      Thanks. Answers that actually answer my questions would be appreciated.

20090221022951AAxqYCO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Started weaning - what next?	We started weaning Lukas at 19 weeks as he was showing all the signs and having a phenomenal amount of milk!  We started with baby rice, single veg/fruit purées and when he'd tried several different ones, we started mixing a couple together (like carrot & pea or apple and mango).  He's 6 months in a few days and his eating schedule now is:      9am: 8oz formula      11am - baby cereal & water or juice... sometimes fruit purée too if still hungry!       2pm - 8oz formula      5pm - veg purée & water or juice      8pm - 9oz formula before bed      He then sleeps through and has nothing until 9am next morning when he wakes up.  (He was sleeping through for a month or two before we started solids.)        I just wondered if that's the right kind of thing and what comes next?!  Is it OK to add a third meal of solids soon?  Can I give him anything other than fruit/veg purées?

20090220183032AAdkwRH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How am I doing with this chart?	This is our first month ttc, and here is a chart I came up with:       http://i258.photobucket.com/albums/hh278...       Red dots are my periods, hearts is intercourse, green dots are "supposed" fertile days, and the yellow dot is my estimated conception date. However, I do have irregular periods so I was told to basically keep sperm in there the whole time.      and also, I have had a cold this past week, could that interfere with trying to get pregnant? (I know stress can)      Thank you for being patient and answering my question, I am still learning. I should try to be more patient, but we're ttc # 1 and you know how that feels ! =)

Hello ladies :)   I've been wondering something for a week or so and I'd like to hear more opinions.I'm married with 3 children 4yrs old,17 months and 5 months old.I never tried to conceive any of them...it just happened.My husband ejaculated in me 3 times and I got pregnant in each one.   Now my thoughts are like who gives people the chances to have children?I read so many questions in here from women that can't get pregnant and keep on trying for long periods of time and I feel sorry for them...motherhood is the best thing that can happen to a woman.It's like someone out there determines that.Others get pregnant and abort the babies others can't and feel miserable.Is this something that has to do with God or it's our fault as well?      Does the way of living affects fertility?(smoking,junk foods,drinking,drugs etc?)      Thanks :) xxxx

Has anyone's dreams in regards to the sex of there baby been true, or could it be that I want a little girl so bad, that I dream about it.

20090220182417AA1f73w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTCers, abortion, and Obama...?	Earlier I responded to a question that upset the asker. I'm assuming it upset other people as well. I'm sorry it upset you, but I've been upset  too. This particular question had to do with welfare, but then abortion and how Obama is allegedly for killing babies seemed to be the main issue I offended ppl on, so here is my response:   Of course I am not for killing innocent children!! I'll just say that right now. But I get very frustrated, because the truth is that there is a law against murder-and people still committ it. Abortion was outlawed once as well, and people STILL DID IT. As much as I am personally very much against it, no law is ever going to stop it. That's one of the many sad facts of life. And it really upsets me that people just like to slam Obama, when he's only trying to do what he can. It may not be right, and we don't have to agree, but obviously everything in the past has NOT worked. You can at least give the man credit for TRYING to help. George Bush, Bill Clinton, and virtually every president has done something wrong. They're only human.   I just think blaming everything on Obama will get you, me, and everyone else absolutely nowhere. And we can argue until we're dead, and it won't change the minds of women who decide to kill their babies. The only thing we can do is pray for them, pray that God will help them see that they are wrong, pray for those babies, and then shower our own babies in all the love and affection so they can make a difference in this world.      My question is this: If YOU were President of the United States, how would YOU fix our problems? What would you say to half the country that disagrees with you? What would you say to the house representatives who pressure you? Obviously you will never be able to please everyone... so basically, instead of grumbling about how everything Obama does is wrong, can you give me a legitimate way that YOU could make it right??   I'm not trying to be rude to anyone, I am just trying to make a point. My point is that nobody has a perfect solution, and if you think you do then get off you *** and run for President!   Thanks :)

20090221001737AAegbnA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you think the world would be better if Men got pregnant instead of Women? Men are the dominant Sex?	Since Men are the more stronger, dominant sex, I think we should be the ones to endure the horrible, terrible, physical pain of giving birth to a baby. Plus us Men have to fight tooth and nail just to get a mate, date a woman or get a girlfriend, getting sex. Plus since Men are the protector, dominant one in the relationship, like it always seems to be about on how the man treats the woman, not how the woman treats the man or both, understandable. I know we can't change this because it is all part of Natural Biology, but do you think since us Men have to do all this work just to get a Woman, and Women can sit back and call the shots, like Women don't seem to have to do any work at all, heck, so do you think it would be better if Men got pregnant instead of Women?

I have thrown up 11 times today ( bad day) and one of the times I passed out and tetany ( muscles got all tense). My question to anyone who has passed out or had medical experience is this bad for the baby? I will probably give my doctor a call in the morning. With my first pregnancy I threw up 4-10 times a day for the first trimester but I never passed out. But I did throw up blood with the first.

20090221012217AAHnQ9q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do my parents have such relaxed rules?	I'm 16 and recently I've noticed how relaxed my parents are. I told them that I was going to this music festival in the summer and they were just like okay. They didn't ask how long, who I was going with or what I would be doing. All my friends' parents gave their children the third degree about it.   This made me realize just how few rules I have. My parents let me go out when I want and never really give me a time to get back, they let me party when I want and they don't mind me drinking.   My dad even told me to have fun with whatever I try. He said "you'll be high for days after." and smiled. It's weird, my parents are okay knowing that I'll be going and trying some drugs, having sex with my boyfriend and being completely irresponsible.    Why are my parents like this? Is it normal? I'm an only child so if anything I'd expect them to be SUPER- protective.

I chuckled only because I didn't know what to say, and I didn't know how to say what I was feeling with out offending my coworkers, because they're my friends. How could I have handled this situation? How or what could I have said without being offensive, or should I have been offensive? Also, why do people feel the need to criticize my son's name?

I just smile and say nothing at all, hoping that they might notice it. I don't want to correct them and make them look dumb.      My son has been mistaken for a girl about three times. Or at least three that I know of. He happens to have a white snowsuit, I guess that might be why. It's white because that was the only one that we could find on sale that would fit him. The last time it happened, we were at the store and this older woman whispered to me "Your daughter is beautiful, she looks like a bunny." I just smiled at her, I guess I should have said Thank you, but then I felt weird saying Thank you too because my son is not a girl.      My friend's daughter was mistaken for a boy. Yet she was sitting in a pink car seat with a pink disney princess blanket. She even had a pink outfit on. I really wonder how anyone can think that a baby with that much pink around it is a boy.      Feel free to share your stories too!

20090220235834AAiciDO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to help a baby who is missing his bottle terribly? Forced weaning!?	My baby is missing his bottle terribly at night and keeps waking up and it's really difficult to stop him crying. He wakes up about 8 times per night and sometimes can cry for half an hour.   Due to a tooth fracture he cannot drink from a bottle anymore,so he is forced to give up his bottle which he really loved :(   What can I do? His tooth broke a bit over a week ago.I hope this won't last forever?    His bottle is available all day,but he won't drink from it. Also not from a sippy cup. I'm feeding him from a normal cup/spoon now.   He is older than 1 1/2 so he can eat anything. And I do know he doesn't need a bottle at this age.

After i had came i took it out of her and realised the condom was split up to about half way down the middle. Most of the *** had collected in the top bit, but there was a tiny bit on the outside of the condom - also about half way down.          She came of her a period a week yesterday, and she's going to the clinic for the morning after pill.      Is there any chance she is pregnant?    All answers welcome thanks.

20090221005943AAmHPMJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What should I do If my child only acts up in school?	How do you get your child to behave as well as he does at home, He's a great kid when he's with me but his teachers say he is terrible towards the other children at school, so much, I have a hard time believing them. Because he does everything I ask him and is very responsive and respectful at home. So how do I get him to behave when I'm not there. I've already tried rewarding him when he gets home from school. What else can I do? Because I don't want him too get kicked out of school. also,He's only 4 going on 5.

I am just getting all excited and curious now and I want to know when was the actual date of conception. I read that it could take 6 days for fertilization and then another 6-10 days for implantation.. or I could have that backwards so now I am really confused as to what day the conception was. My last period began on Jan 21. Using that, it said conception was on the 4th ans fetal age was over 4 weeks. I read that fetal age was supposed to be shorter than gestational age, and we had sex on Jan 29th, and then on Feb 7th. At first I thought that I conceived on the 7th, but now that it says fetal age is 4 weeks, could it have been on the 29th??

20090221054626AA1vQ7p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Help. A four year old with night time cramps?	Ok I have four young boys, but the youngest (4) has suffered with night time cramps for quite a while.      He is very active in the day, has a wide and varied diet with lots of fresh products and he drinks a good amount of juice, milk, water and smoothies.      A night time, he will fall asleep without any problems but often wakes, screaming. He complains of pains in his feet and lower legs. This is very obvious due to the flexing he does with his toes, the way he curls up in a tight ball and his wanting for us to squeeze his feet and legs, to ease the pain. After some Calpol and some TLC he will settle again and sleeps mostly though the rest of the night.      We have taken him twice to the GP's, on both times, have explained in detail his symptoms. The GP has looked into the problem but can only suggest it is 'growing pains' or a lack of calcium in his diet. After this we increased his intake of milk and yogurts but he won't touch cheese at all!      Both of these I disagree with. We live in a very remote area, our GP is the nearest one for 50 miles, and we have a good relationship with her.      Am I being over paranoid, is this 'growing pains'?      Your views please. Thank you xx

I have been trying to make my own version using chicken stock,  pastina ,veggies and some lentils to( thicken and add protein ) to some success but I can't get a good texture(like pot pie) it is either too soupy or too thick and  "lentily". I am trying to stay away from corn starch,partly because I can never get it right and partly because I don't know why. Or possibly a different "bean"? But if it is ok for baby I am willing to try.  Any Ideas out there? Thanks IA .

Isn't wearing tampons or pads such a personal choice that no one other than the wearer should be the one to decide?   I see questions on here about girls wanting to use tampons but their moms or dads won't let them.       Personally, I think that since it is such a personal choice that the parents shouldn't be able to say no. Its one of those areas that it doesn't matter the age of the child or if it is the parents house parents rules, they should have NO jurisdiction.       What do you think?

20090221053428AAOqFvw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How often do you change....?	Your babies nappy (diaper).      My Charlie is 16 weeks old and he still has a nappy change before every feed and then others as required. Most days around 10 nappy changes.      He eats a lot and wees alot and tends to wet through easily so I probably go a little overboard.
20090221053256AAHfc3l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think money or time is more important?	Other than working just to pay the bills, do you think parents that work for extra's like holidays, brand clothes etc., are being better to their children by providing this stuff, or is time more important.      Personally I think time is better.       But it is easy for me to say this because I don't need to work.      This is not a working mother bashing debate.

20090221050549AAVCDJF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 8 month old's stools are black, this means?	My 8 month old, this morning, his stool was in little pellets and black. However, they weren't hard so I know he is not constipated. Does the black mean that he is dehydrated? He has had the stomach bug but is finally getting over it. At the worst of the stomach bug his stools smelled like vomit and were like a light green and white color. He had gone to the ER (this was a few days ago) and they said his electrolyte levels were fine (they took blood from his poor little head because that was the only vein they could get). However, this morning confused me when I saw that because I have heard in the past that it meant a baby is dehydrated. If it makes a difference I introduced Green Beans to him yesterday although he had about 2 force-fed bites before I gave up and fed him mangos, he wouldn't even open his mouth for the beans.         Obv, I am going to ask the doctor today (he has to go get more blood drawn for more tests) but I was wondering on getting a heads up on what other people thought.
20090221041558AA2RA1m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Please could someone help, so confused with how far pregnant I am?	I know that you take the date from your last period as to how far pregnant you are, so I am approx 8 weeks pregnant.       Last week at a scan they told me the baby is measuring at approx 5 1/2 weeks old from conception, so  bean now would be approx 6 weeks old      My question is how far gone am I if people ask? Do i say from the conception date, or the date of last period??      With my 1st M/C I was told the baby had stopped developing at 8 weeks, do you think that would have been 8 weeks from conception, the reason I want to know is so I know when Im passed that date as then I may relax a little more.       Sorry if this doest make sense and thanks in advance for any replies

20090221032000AAyCqnY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Help please? Why do i have to be like this?	I'm almost 17 and i feel like i can't satisfy myself. I mean, i am happy with myself, but i'm always wanting to change something even if i like it. I recently just got a tattoo off of instinct because i wanted something new and exciting. I absolutely love my long hair, but i cut about 4 inches off of it because i wanted something new (it's still long, just not as). I also just put pink highlights in it on top of the blonde ones i did about a month or two ago. They are barely even there, so now i am thinking i want to dye my hair a light brown (it's naturally dirty blonde). I also am always buying new clothes or new stuff for my car, like new rims all the time or new seat covers. I rearrange my room so much it's not even funny. I also bought a 32" television last month because i wanted something different to look at even though i didn't even need it and the price was outrageous. I have a job, all of these things come from my own pocket. Why am i like this, though? Help. =[

20090221033548AAYmwdc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast feeding questions about pumping? please.?	Sorry if this gets long I am going to try to fit in everything, and thanks to anyone who puts in the effort to read it and anwser.      I am only 12 weeks pregnant but in my baby books i have read lots about breastfeeding i have read its best for the baby and babies tend to be less sick, slightly more intelligent, and less over weight. And also helps me to lose weight and shrink my uterus. but is there anything else it does? And how hard is it to actually start breastfeeding? What does it feel like when you do it?  And how good is that bond i have read  about? And why do people not at least try when its proven how good it is?       Also the books never say anything about pumping ever! and I will be needing to do that because I am in school. about 3-4 hours a night monday-thursday which i will have to go back about a week after the baby is born. but the good thing is I willl not have to work for hopefully 3 months or more depending on how things go. so my questions about pumping are. Is it hard? When are you soupposed to do it (like befor you feed after or whenever)? How long does it take? How do you store it and for how long it will last?       I am from a family where no one breastfeeds or ever has and I have never even seen someone do it (except you tube videos).  Also the first few times i do it i want no one in the room (except doc/nurses). how do i tell my and his family that polietly and how long after birth can i wait to breastfeed? Thanks everyone so much again and anything helps i am going into this alone and not much support from family.

20090221055051AAXDuc3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ttc questions.......?	I feel REALLY good and excited about this month. I really think this month could be our month, even though we just started trying again on Wed and last night =] The first day of my last pd was 14 days ago. And my cycles have been off since I stopped taking birth control back in Sept. So they've never started on the day I think I am going to. I noticed for 2 days I have just a little CM, not very much.. does that mean I'll be ovulating soon? I always know when I'm ovulating because my CM gets really slick and there's a lot of it. I know sometimes, you can get CM confused with left-over sperm (gross, I know). I always notice it the next day. If I was to get an OPK, should I start using it now, or when should I? My husband and I decided to baby dance every other day for 3 wks, just to be on the safe side. Any advice??

20090221055017AA4G9rX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Choosing a formula? weening 6mo off nursing?	what is a good formula to choose for my 6mth old? I have been solely nursing him for his whole life so far and he's eating all kinds of baby foods now. his first teeth are coming in real quick, and I want to get him onto bottles as soon as I can.      he shows alot of interest in bottles, but not necessarily the fluids inside. I've tried apple and pear juices and formula (nestle good start)      is there a way I can make the formula more appealing to him? should I choose a different brand? is there much difference between formulas? I'm thinking that I might want to try a sweeter variety, because he's so used to my breastmilk.      He also likes to take our water and pop bottles and chews on the cap, but knows how to hold it and everything.      I can't pump or express milk to get him used to bottles that way. there are health issues here including milk supply, uneven breasts, and soreness when pumping or expressing. I wouldn't even get enough to fill a bottle for him. point is, that I have to start out with formula bottles and not my own milk. why, doesn't matter, as I've noticed with my previous questions, many people still suggest this method even though I've stated directly its not really an option. anyhow, what formula do I choose?      what kind of nipple would work best for him? my nipples are large, and fast flowing. he often has to bite me to ease it lol. anyhow, I think he'd prefer latex over plastic, but I'm not sure what shape to look for. should I be looking for something that is similar to the size of my areola and nipple when he's eating?

20090221053910AAEQ6YE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and really sick...worried?	I have been on antibiotics for 6 days and I keep getting worse. I saw my doctor on Wednesday and she said she was worried about it developing into pneumonia because my body wasn't fighting it off and I was getting worse on the antibiotics. She said if I wasn't better by Monday to call and get seen. Then she specifically said if I started coughing stuff up that I should call and get seen right away.       Now here it is Saturday morning and all last night I have been coughing severely. It hurts really bad and I also have been coughing up stuff and it hurts to take breaths. I also have a stabbing pain in my lower right side that gets worse when I cough.       After hours and on weekends, I have to talk to the OB on call at the hospital and so I called and she isn't my regular doctor. I told her everything my doctor said and despite that, she said take some cough drops and wait till Monday when the office is open and call for an appointment. But MY doctor said if this happened to be seen right away!       So now I don't know what to do. This is who I'm supposed to turn to after hours or in an energency. If I ignore this doctor and go to the ER, she will be the doctor there. There is no way to talk to any other doctor for a second opinion unless I go to a totally different hospital that has none of my medical history or access to my charts.       I just don't understand why my regular doctor is so concerned and says  get seen immediately if this happens and the other doctor is like take a cough drop and wait till Monday. I'm in pain and I'm scared for myself and my baby. What would you do?

What I do find a bit odd is Laura has conditions to what our baby will be called. Here are a few of them.      > If it's a girl born on a Monday she will be named Tenisha.   > If it's a girl born in April she will be named April.   > If it's a girl with blonde hair she will be named Catrin   > If it's a boy born in our hometown (that's the plan but anything could happen) he will be named Devon   > If it's a boy born outside our hometown he will be named Benjamin      Did you have any conditions or is my fiancée just odd? I think she thinks it more exciting like that rather than having one name picked out for definate.

20090221040537AA8tF0v	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Help. I'm a danger to myself and others.?	Okay, it's melodramatic, but I feel like it's true. I am so sleep deprived that I am hallucinating and afraid to drive myself and my son anywhere and I don't know what to do.   My son is almost 9 months old and waking up every 45 min. at night. Sometimes I'm lucky and he'll sleep an hour and a half stretch. I have let him cry it out twice in the past and it works for about a week and then he goes back to this. What am I doing wrong? I've got a sleep routine and when I put him down in the crib he goes right to sleep. He just keeps waking up and won't go back to sleep.   I've tried co-sleeping but neither my son nor I sleep well that way - we wake each other up. I give him a pacifier when he sleeps is it possible he's waking up wanting that? How would I break that habit? He's too big to swaddle. He's breastfed and I offer 3 meals a day but he doesn't eat a ton, just a few bites at each meal. He also won't take a bottle since I don't have much help at home I just fed him from my breast since birth. My family and friends live on the other side of the country and my husband works 80+ hours a week including weekends (no exaggeration) so he tries to help but isn't really able to for very long because he needs sleep and to keep his job.   I've read through all the Kellymom and Dr. Sears links about sleeping...I haven't read any books on baby sleep but let's be honest unless it was a book on tape I couldn't read it - I'd either fall asleep or my cranky, sleep-deprived kid would interrupt me with every sentence. I'm desperate - if anyone has any ideas?

20090219174451AANnYSu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long did you breastfeed?	My daughter is 4 months old. I have breastfed her since day one, we have been trying to get her to take a bottle for about a month and a half now. She does not like bottles, I have bought several different ones, and still nothing. (Drop-ins, Nuk, Adiri natural nurser, Avent) My hubby is the one that gives her the bottle, mostly when I am not here, and she doesn't take it. I still want to breastfeed, I just want her to be able to take a bottle so that I can later wean her and so if I need to leave her with a sitter I can do so.     I am just curious to see how long you went breastfeeding without putting milk in a bottle, just boob, and nothing else. I am afraid she will never take a bottle. I am kind of hoping that maybe when its time for her to take a sippy cup that will work out better.    Any tips or suggestions?

20090219173229AAiBe4p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do you think about all the SIDS recommendations?	Here are just some of them. I find some of them contradictory- I mean, wouldn't you be more likely to overheat in a sleep sack than not? I'm scared of SIDS, and my heart goes out to those who have lost a baby, but some of this stuff is very confusing. In the prenatal classes they warned about flat head, and how it is becoming a huge public health problem, but you can't use wedges or positioners, just turn the crib and turn baby's head. But would that really work?! Here's just some of the things that SIDS website (www.sids.org) says to do:         *Keep a ceiling fan going in the room   *keep the room cold   * don't let the baby sleep in your bed or fall asleep with baby on a couch or in a chair   *keep baby from overheating, but warm   *layers, swaddling and "sleep sacks" are fine, loose blankets are not   *do not over clothe the infant   *use a pacifier   *no crib bumpers, pillows, blankets, nothing but a crib sheet   *baby is to be placed only on back   * no sleep positioners or wedges   *keep baby in parents room until 6 months of age      What do you think?

20090203093836AA7bjVc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you do or how would you handle this?	I asked questions last night about mono, so sorry if you answer this one after you answered the ones last night.      I have no idea what else to do, please read and let me know what you would do.      I have a 5 year old daughter, for about a week and a half she has been having fall down crying, horrible headaches. Last Sunday I took her to the ER, the dr said it was strep, never did a swab or anything. Wednesday the headaches were still horrible, so I took her to her regular ped., he told me he wasn't sure what it was, but if she wasn't better Friday to call him. She wasn't complaining about her head, I figured she was doing better. Saturday she was a little whiney, and Sunday night she was complaining about her head and stomach hurting. Yesterday morning she woke up with the horrible headache again. Off to the doctor again, he swabbed for strep and it was negative. So he sent us to the ER. They did a cat scan and blood work. The ER doc told us if her blood count was high, they would check her for meningitis. Her scan came back normal and he said her blood count was normal, but she had mono. I went on line to get more info on mono and found that when you have mono your blood count is high. I don't think she has meningitis because she doesn't have a fever.      Does anyone know for sure if you have mono, does your blood count get elevated? If it does, what would you do if you were in my shoes?
20090203094336AAngq6U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am i pregnant? (please tell me im not)?	I have been on birth control since last march. (that's 9 months from when i stopped) I've been on pills, the ring and the last one I tried was the patch.  I like to take long showers, so one day, I was in the shower and my patch fell off. I was having trouble with non-sticky patches earlier, so i got mad and said forget it. I'm through with bc.  Well, that was only on the 2nd week of putting the patch on.  I had my period a week and a day earlier than usual.  My boyfriend and i have been having sex protected and pulling out (at different moments) I was fine until yesterday, I noticed that after we have sex,my stomach cramps up and i've been feeling nauseous.  I'm a week and a day late and i've taken a pregnancy test and it came out negetive. im still worried. im always tired also, my breast havent gotten sore or anything like that, so i still have hope that I just have a few symptoms and it could just be coincidential. But on the contrary, i feel scared because i searched on here and quite a few ppl said that they got pregnant within a week of getting off the patch.  Also another thing, is it possible for me to get pregnant if my bf came (he pulled out) and a little bit after, we went at it again
20090203092624AADnZzC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Which ones fit best......?	I am not pregnant right now but my husband and I are planning on having another baby.

Also she has already decided to both formula and breastfeed, also too wait at least 1and a half hours before breastfeeding after smoking any marijuana because it is averagly 8times worse through breastmilk than through mothers blood.       So please any information would help.   Thanks in advance.

20090219172358AA5ZhTZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How can I get him through his first break-up?	Hello, my little brother (13) is under my legal responisibility. I have been caring for him for about 6 years. He and I have this really amazing relationship...we're always talking about things and have a very open relationship.       Tuesday, he and his girlfriend of two years got in a fight and broke up.  He is just torn apart, he's depressed, angry the next minute, sad the next and is trying to accept it but then contradicts himself.      I want him to talk to me about how he is, but he just wants to talk about her. he changes the subject when I say something that is about him. Why is he doing this?      I want to help him get through this....but I am not sure what to do. I hate to see him like that. He barely eats, and he's really emotional.       What can I say to help him talk to me about how he feels( I know him well enough to know he is trying to figure everything out but is dying for help)

20090219173433AAxBNMy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How does a miscarriage look?	Forgive what seems to be a dumb question.  I just had a miscarriage on Friday and today a funny looking "clot" came out.  I know this is a pregnancy area but I ask because I figure the people here would know about it the best.  It was of course red, but it had what seemed like what stuff surrounding it (not like yeast or anything, just stringy white stuff, I think tissue?).  I lost most of it Friday morning, but I've been cramping ever since and kept having clots, and then this huge thing comes out.  I was about 2 months along or less (not sure, the u/s keeps saying differently).  There was no heartbeat.  Again, my apologies to those who think this question odd, but I need to know.

I've had symptoms but i don't know if they're just in my head. Here are for sure symptoms: increased vaginal discharge, cramping, and cold symptoms (i read that some women get colds before finding out they are pregnant). The symptoms I have that could be due to pms or just in my head are food cravings, frequent urination, bloating,and headaches. This morning I did have a wave of nausea but it went away after about 5-10 mins. Do you think i'm pregnant????

20090203095407AAzzCrK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Whats the best way to deal with toddler waking up at night?	I took a look around his bedroom to see if anything in there may be scaring him at night and it SEEMS that everything is okay. We did not have a night light so we purchased one last night to keep in his room so he has a bit of light, just in case. He has his blanket and at least 1 stuffed animal so if he does wake up, he should have things that make him comfortable.     Usually when I hear him through the monitor moving around and I can hear that hes starting to wake up, I let him be and see if he can put himself back down. Or if he fusses just a bit I still wait it out. But the longer I wait, the more upset he gets. And the other night when I picked him up, he was holding me SO tight it was almost as if he had a nightmare or something. Or that something scared him. I have tried sitting with him in his room, rocking him back to sleep, but he moves around and fights me every step of the way.     Of course he sleeps like a rock in our bed. But I hate it because I get my little corner of the bed with no blankets and the occasional kick in the face, so Im miserable each time he comes in our room.     My husband loves having him in our bed. He says he loves holding him. Which of course, I love holding our son too. But I also enjoy my sleep..    Is there any advice you can give to help me convince my husband that our son needs to continue to sleep in HIS room? (Ive tried using sex against him and it doesnt work out that well. Baby in bed = no sex)     What is the best way to go with dealing with our 2 yr old when he does wake up at night? Do I ignore him? Do I let him cry? HELP!

20090219180535AARtMpD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I really need advice i honestly dont know anymore?	okay im 16 and a junior. but for this i have to think way back to my freshman year.      **************************************...      freshman year:   there waas this girl in most of my classes, her name is Kate. well when i tried to be friends w. her she was a bit*h closed me down. for some reason i would always work w. her in spanish and she would always do all the work. one day i found out she said it was cause she thought i was too dumb to handle it and i would make her fail. i got mad and confronted her on it. she was like oh no oh no i didnt mean that, u can do some work on this project. i overheard her call me real mean names. then summer break happened.      over that summer my friend gabi talked about kate so much!      sophomore year   the beginning. gabi acted like she was kates best friend after all that stuff she told meabout her in the summer. so during english i said to this girl abby, wow last year gabi talked all this sh*t on kate and now all of a sudden they r bff. gabi and kate found out and got mad at me and abby for talkign about them. so we had an honest lunch time conversation. didnt go so well. i was honest, maybe too honest. i said "Gabi, yes i talked about you and i really am sorry, i have never talked about you in the past. then i looked at Kate and said Mkay Kate, so i dont like you, never have liked you. i did talk abouut you, i have in the past, and no doubt will in the future. and i dont like you cause u really hurt my feelings in the past." WELL thats all i had to say and Kate started bawling. and  of course i looked like a bit*h and the only 2 people who saw things from my perspective, Abby and Karen were not in my next class. i was literally all alone and i got pulled out of class and so did Kate and we got talked to. it was the worst. we both apologized. i didnt mean it then, i did apologize months later and i meant it then.      **************************************...      later on me and Kate started talking and really became friends we talked every day over the summer but lately i dont know why but i really dont like her too much any more. i get bad vibes off her.      i dnt no wat to do anymore.      btw the part in between the ** are just a back story of me and kate lol.

20090203095440AAn9B4V	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Please help girls...beta hcg levels...im in limbo and my little heart is broken..?	So I had emergency exploratory laparascopy surgery this past weekend because I went to the ER with abd pain. My LMP was Dec 25th. I don't know exactly how far along I am because I ovulate later than day 14. Its more like day 22. Neways I went in to the ER they said I had an ectopic pregnancy. After the surgery the dr said there was no ectopic pregnancy. THey did an ultrasound and said they could not determine the yolk sac or whatever. So neways I went to the operating room. They did not do a D&C or nething like that. So neways on sat @ 2 am my beta hcg was around 3000. I had more blood work yesterday and it was almost 5000. My dr said that he isn't going to bank anything on these numbers until friday because he has been tricked by these numbers before. So in any event I need to kno if I was going to lose my baby wouldn't the numbers be droppng after the surgery. I know that the numbers didn't double. Ohh im just so confused and I don't know what to think. I know that I have to wait until thursday for more blood work but I would just really like to know what I am dealing with here. My hubby and I REALLY want this baby. Its heartbreaking to me that we might lose it. Also my dr said that he doesn't care that they didn't see a yolk sac because its so early thats why he hates when they do the ultrasounds bc it causes so much anxiety early on. So please someone tell me what they think about this whole thing...are my chances of having this baby good or bad? I just want to be prepared...Thanks so much!!!

20090219180909AA3mTrd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What to say to someone who faked a pregnancy?	My boss (who I can't stand) has been lying about being pregnant for attention. (amongst other things) She claimed that she was a 'high-risk pregnancy' (probably hoping for more attention) and then bragged that she's miscarried 8 times.      She lied about having doctor's appointments.   "I showed up to my appointment and it turns out they cancelled it without telling me"   "I called to confirm my appointment and they rescheduled it without telling me"      She has switched my schedule 3 times, this week alone, to cover her imaginary appointments while she stays home and gets drunk. I'm sick of her feeling the need to share ANYTHING with me, especially lies. Today was supposed to be her exam.      Now she has been calling up every employee individually to tell them that she was 8 weeks along and there was no heartbeat. *she likes to call at all hours of the night to tell stories that start with "want to feel bad for me?" so I've had to avoid my cellphone*      I'll be hearing from her any time now and want to have something awesome (hilarious/cruel/or insightful) to say so she knows I don't care to partake in her gossipy attention seeking bullcrap.
