20090205161317AATSc54	Social Science;Economics	Why is America's economic crisis affecting so many other countries?	Can you give examples of other countries that need United States for a source of imports (Visible or invisible)   (an example of what i mean) I know Bahamas is affected because it's main industry is tourism and most of the tourists are from the US. Therefore, since the US citizens are encouraged to save money by not taking vacations, we are in trouble.    Can you give any other countries that similarily require US. (China, European COuntries, Japan, etc, etc?
20090205161116AAozfJh	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	I had a dream the other night that i saw my grandpa who passed away 3 years ago.      I saw him clear as day sitting in his chair and he had a smile on his face when i sat his great grand daughter on his lap.       In the dream Our daughter was just starting to walk. He ( my grandpa) was encouraging her to get up and start walking. My husband was on the other side of the room and was talking to my grandpa from across the room. Before i sat his great grand daughter on his lap my hubby and i's daughter her and i were playing on the carpet in the living room. Grandpa looked very happy to see her.       They ( hubby and my grandpa ) were talking about that my hubby was going to retire soon when our daughter was getting a little older.       Hubby said yes im going to retire soon so that i can be with our daughter and spend more time with her.       Our daughter was 15 months in the dream . It must have been winter cause she was in her poked dotted footy pj's.             Extra Information non dream related:      Hubby and i are trying to get pregnant.       Have been trying since November of 2007.       The funny thing is that he never had a chance to meet my hubby at all.          Hubby is black and Grandpa has never liked black people when he was alive.       Hubby is still 9 years from retiring this year.       Thanks for answering      What does that dream mean?

Einmal habe ich gelesen (der Author ist ein Dozent der Psychologie und Sexuologie), dass für einen Menschen eigentlich cca 3 Partner w?hrend seines Lebens die richtigen sind. In jedem Lebesabschnitt haben wir unterschiedliche Kr?fte, Erwartungen und Einstellungen, zu denen auch unterschiedliche Partner passen. Aus seiner Sicht ist es für den Menschen eher unnatürlich sich lebensl?nglich zu binden. Das erfordern nur die gesellschaftliche Regeln. Sollen wir also unverheiratet bleiben? Oder lieber mehr mals im Leben heiraten? Oder sich einfach damit zufrieden stellen, was wir haben, bzw. auf die Idealsuche resignieren ?!?

Tener miedo no es malo, es la respuesta  a ciertos impulsos que tenemos, hay un miedo que te ayuda y a hay otro que no, entonces tener miedo es bueno o malo.    Es importante sabe distinguir lo que es miedo pues, no debemos confundirnos  entre el amor y el miedo ya que, se sienten los mismos síntomas, pues cuando tenemos miedo, se sienten “mariposas en el estomago”, y cuando nos  enamoramos o nos dan  un beso de amor, pasa lo mismo hay que saber distinguir......... y tu que opinas?? tienes miedo o simplemente estas enamorado(a)??

However, the problem is that i dont use advanced language when writing essays or in a group discussion. I know some great expressions, idioms and stuff like that, but i simply cant recall them when i need them. So my essays are full of words like "nice", "good", "bad" . What should i do to be able to USE these sophisticated expressions i know so that they dont just "hide" somewhere deep in my brain? Im taking an important exam this year so i would like to improve as much as possible.

Uma conhecida foi assassinada pelo ex marido e ainda a criticaram dizendo que ela "deu mole" pq deveria ter fugido, desaparecido do mapa antes disso acontecer. Uma mulher trai, é chamada de vagabunda, vadia enquanto que se o homem trai é normal pq ele é homem e homem precisa mesmo destas coisas. Se a mulher reclama de algo é pq ela é drámatica chata e está de TPM. Em nenhum destes episódios, a sociedade pára pra pensar se a mulher n?o está tendo mesmo raz?o de reclamar,. de trair, de decidir ficar onde está mesmo sendo amea?ada de morte. Ninguém pergunta se esta mulher está satisfeita na cama com o marido, se este marido a compreende e está disposto ao diálogo, ninguém diz que independente de qualquer motivo marido nenhum tem o direito de espancar ou matar a mulher...Enfim... ninguém está se importando com nada. A mulher é sempre culpada por tudo. Até quando é assassinada pelo marido ainda encontram um jeito de p?r a culpa nela..... Como é dificil ser mulher.....

20090205095936AAnSDmX	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do feminists have any theories as to why girls and young women are becoming more violent?	Why are girls and young women becoming more violent? Do feminists have any ideas/theories as to why violence, aggressiveness and anti-social behavior is increasing in girls? Shouldn't this be one of feminism's concerns? I remember being violent and aggressive myself when I was younger. I was angry and lacked empathetic perspective, I didn't understand that I could hurt others. I remember feeling like I wanted to hurt people, I lashed out and even brought knives to school. I grew out of that "phase" by my late teens, I no longer feel that kind of anger and rage. I wasn't even one of the "mean" girls at school either, I remember coming across so many mean, angry violent girls.       "(July 2006) Adolescent U.S. girls are being arrested in record numbers. And every year brings new media attention to mean or aggressive girls' behavior—with sensational newspaper headlines and book titles such as See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do About It and Sugar and Spice and No Longer Nice: How We Can Stop Girls' Violence.1 Could there be an epidemic of violence in the United States among girls—who have traditionally been considered more mature and less trouble to raise than boys?      The answer isn't clear-cut, although national arrest statistics for simple and aggravated assaults by girls have been on the rise for more than a decade. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports note the female percentage of total juvenile assault arrests jumped from 21 percent to 32 percent between 1990 and 2003.2 And the U.S. female juvenile assault rate rose from about 200 for every 100,000 girls to 750 between 1980 and 2003 (see Figure 1)."    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/AreUSGi...       "Historically, men commit more crime than women, but that pattern has been changing very slowly in the UK and comparable nations.       In 1957, men were responsible for 11 offences for every one perpetrated by a woman. today that ratio has narrowed to four-to-one."    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/74019...

20090203043604AA61SN3	Social Science;Sociology	Generation of under 25 the “Hitler Youth” of Modern Times?	It alarms me? Could it happen to me? Has this happened to you?       Your at a private party and someone captures a video or photograph and later threatens to take action for profit or takes action to assassinate your character motivated by their mean spirited nature the potential to coerce you into actions you would not generally take, makes your private indiscretion a “Public Affair”; common knowledge to your parents, possibly a lover, friends and family to see.      Michael Phelps probably felt safe, relaxing amongst friends prior to a cell phone  photograph with him "sucking on a large water bong" becoming the latest CNN bi line.      The question is has something like this happened to you? Do you feel the pressure of "big brother" when in public? Possibly someone has photographed you or made a video  of you involved in some form of indiscretion (sexual, drug or alcohol related )the person has made the contents public, or even worse, blackmailed you into payment for the return of video footage and or cell phone photographs.      Are we turning into a country of Voyeurs for profit?   Isn’t there suppose to be a certain honor amongst friends an unspoken code of understood ethical behavior.  Apparently not amongst the friends of swimmers with Eight Gold Medals.      Personally I'm on my way to the store to purchase a pair of "Speedo" to wear on the beach this summer. Maybe something in a "Jamacian Blue".       Safetymax out!

20090203030747AA88mnB	Social Science;Psychology	When someone self mutilates by cutting themselves, what is this?  Obsession, Psychosis, Fetish, or Fad?	I've read and seen televised stores about some teens who cut themselves when disturbed, troubled, or upset.  The cuts are not so much deep gashes but rather surface level marks, sometimes even in patterns or spelling out words, and I'm curious how much of this is a psychological phenomenon that might occur on it's own due to some psychosis or pattern of thinking, or whether there is some copy-cat element to it which teens may be more inclined to adopt because it is interesting or in vogue with some of their peers or just rebellion against the world.      Has there been a history through the ages of people purposely cutting themselves in some kind of emotional display to themselves privately or perhaps to others in crying out?  I'm not talking about body piercings with jewelry or adornments like African lip rings.  I'm talking about self-mutilation because the person is upset and claims to not be able to help themselves.      Is this really an obsession or psychological sickness?  Or is a disguised attempt to be "tragically hip" such that it is more copy-cat behavior rather than something the individual cannot help or keep from doing?      And for those who do this now, have done it in the past, or been touched by someone in their life who was prone to cut themselves, this question is not meant to trivialize what's going on.  It is a genuine question to try to better understand this phenomenon as to it's root cause and psychological genesis.

20090203043812AA2WDM2	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do women assume a man is angry if ?	he does not behave a certain way ? For example less and less men are interested in marriage, therefore men hate women. Seen as in the past men could expect certain services and benefits from a wife and as women's lib progressed women clearly stated they can not expect those services anymore (wash your own clothes, cook your own meals, if you think marriage is a guarantee for sex you are mistaken), cant it be more of a matter of not being interested/attracted to marriage anymore ?       I do not see men withdrawing from women, quite the opposite, men try to land as many women as they can.    If men do not pursue things like marriage anymore, isn't it more likely that there is nothing in marriage that attracts/benefits men, rather than a hatred for women ? Something needs to be attractive to you for you to pursue it, maybe as gender roles changed, to men marriage lost all attraction, not necessarily resulting in a hatred for women. It might be just marriage that fails to attract men.
20090203042227AAyfX3h	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can you help i am a little worried?	ok so last night i had this dream, it was that four of us were walking home from school, 2 good friends of mine and a friend from pre primary that recently started going to my school. anyway we were on our way when suddenly the old friend ushered that we should play a trick and sneak away      so we went into a street that was more narrow, and it was pitch black. i hid in the front of the first house. just layed down on the grass with a slight bit of light on my shoes, the old friend however went way further back, i'm not sure where because it was too dark, and as i was waiting for my good friends to come and search for us, i heard a huge scream and knew it was my friend, i'm pretty sure he was killed,at first it seemed like a joke then a split second later i realised what had happened. then i woke up.

20090203032731AAEVKLz	Social Science;Psychology	Where can I find information on "Identity"?	For no particular reason I am interested in learning about human identity, like what makes a person that particular person.  Obviously, it has something to do with the brain.  Is a persons identity in a particular spot in the brain?  Would it be possible to move it from one brain to the other?  As well as memories?  Are memories connected to identity?  Those are questions that should help understand what my initial question is about.

20090203041308AAoIBhd	Social Science;Psychology	Trying to get over this without therapy?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me. ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.       Should I seek therapy?
