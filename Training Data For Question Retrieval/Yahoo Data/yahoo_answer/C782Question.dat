20090305093504AARbU0e	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	Random questions about Coke?	1) When were plastic Coke bottles common (not invented, but generally in use) both in the US and worldwide? I'm working on a story set in 1978, and I don't drink soda (and wasn't alive then), so I wouldn't know. I THINK they were glass in the US at the time, but am unsure. Wikipedia does not clarify.      2) What was added to Coke to sweeten it in the US before high fructose corn syrup, and would it taste different than international products (at least as noticeably as hcfs tastes from sugar)? Wikipedia says 'sugar glucose or fructose', so I am not sure which was used and whether that would be different from the rest of the world's Coke sweetener at that time.      Yes, this is really nitpicky and random, but now it's nagging me since Wikipedia won't tell me!
