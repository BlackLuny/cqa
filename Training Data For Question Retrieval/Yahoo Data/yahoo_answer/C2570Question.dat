I have 20 x 9 wheels for my 05 Avalanche Z-71 (without the plastic cladding) and I am interested in the Cooper Zeon LTZ all-terrain tire. I want the tires to look meaty and aggressive but i am not sure of the size to get and the size is crucial to how well i like it. Do i get 275-60R-20 or 285-50R20?       I like the width of the 285 but i don't know if the 50 will be tall enough for me? On the other hand, i like the 60 but don't know if the 275 will be wide enough? I want the tire to fill out the wheel-well and do not want crazy tire rub. Any ideas?

20090222150850AAeQ3BC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;GMC	1992 Saturn SC2 Fuel / Electrical Problems?	Ive been having problems with my 1992 Saturn SC2 stick shift. I was led to believe it was bad gas but Im not sure. Ive gotten gas at 3 different places and it does the same thing. I can only drive it a certain amount of time until it does this. When going at a constant speed it feels like just randomly hitting the brake and jerking it. Sometimes when I speed up it will stop for a few minutes or not do it as bad. Also, when I stop and take off again, it will jerk really bad, shut off and it wont start. I have replaced the battery, alternator, fuel pump (last march), fuel filter, changed the oil, spark plugs, new computer. Im not sure what else to do or where to go from here. My moms truck started doing the same thing but it was bad gas and ruled it out with a bottle of ISO Heet. Her truck is a 1989 Nissan Pickup Truck SE-V6 automatic. We did the same thing for my car but it didn't work. Any answers or help is GREATLY APPRECIATED!!! Please & Thanks.

20090222152318AAwQsmX	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Why do people drive way over the speed limit on the interstate but way below the speed limit on a 2 lane road?	On the highway, I usually drive the posted speed limit or sometimes a little under in bad weather. On the interstate, the majority of drivers drive 10-15 mph over the posted speed limit and very few drive within the speed limit as if they think "speed limit" means "minimum". I stay to the right and watch everyone zip past. On a small rural two lane highway(one lane in each direction) drivers tend to drive much slower. Most drivers drive right at the limit, but quite a few drivers prefer to drive 15-20 mph below the posted speed limit. I have been behind a slow driver doing 40mph in a 60mph zone but when we both turned onto the interstate, the slow driver sped off probably doing 80mph in a 70mph zone. Why do people drive that way? Doesn't the speed limit mean the same on both types of roads?      BTW, I usually give myself more time when I drive on a two lane highway.

It used to take about 10 mins after start up before the needle on the temperature gauge started creeping up,eventually getting close to the middle of the range. Recently, even after warming up / driving the car for 30 mins, the needle is still on cold, sometimes it will creep up a little, if at all.       Whenever I turn on the heat (after trying to warm up the car for 10-15 mins first) it always blows hot air but my car is an Audi and I am told that the car's temp gauge should always hover around the middle of the gauge, so I'm worried.      Any ideas on what is wrong with the car? Could I be causing any further damage while driving it cold?

20090222100846AAFhiHn	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Any Ideas before I get the code?	I just had the engine replaced in my 2001 PT Cruiser, while driving it home it quit on me, mechanic said it was the position sensor coming unplugged is all, then my check engine light came on telling me my catalytic converter was going out which it did. So since I couldn't afford a new one we cut it off hollowed it out and welded it back on.  That was about a week ago.       I was out all over town and when I was about a mile from my house when the car wouldn't go above 40 and it sounded like I was revving   my engines and my rpms were real high.  When I got home I put the car into park and let it idol and within a minute it died and woudn't restart.  When I came out the next morning she started up and I let her warm up, took her for a lap around the block and she seemed to run fine.  I shut her off went inside the house and did the same thing except for this time she died again and wouldn't start for about 10 to 15 minutes.  My check engine light is on but the nearest auto parts store isn't very close to have it read.  Im thinking it is a sensor but was hoping for a little clue before I make the daring attempt to go to the auto store.        Im not looking for any magic here just a little insight thanks.

Flushed Core only.Brown at first then flowed freely and clean Then drained radiator of old antifreeze, refiled w/ water, ran for 10 mins and re-drained. Dirty brown again but then flowed clear. Filled radiator with flush treatment and water and drove car highway and local for about 6 hours over a few days. Engine temp stayed in good zone whole time. Drained, refilled with 50/50 antifreeze/water mix,  But still no freakin' heat. What next? Are there 2 separate thermostats, 1 for engine, 1 regulating flow through core? (I've not changed any thermostat yet.) Also I see that the hose from RADIATOR on its way to the core forks off at one point into 2 separate directions. 1 goes directly to the core the other seems to go back into the engine. What's that all about? Is this a safety setup of some kind? Thanks All.

Hi All      My Clio's battery has gone kaput (we know this because we have tried replacement battery from our other car and its fine) but it has triggered the ABS warning light and the service light (just says 'serv' no spanner symbol) to come on, as well as the usual loss of all saved functions,  eg trip computer, radio etc. My question is how do you reset the service light? The abs will have to be done with engine management thing (unless anyone knows how to do it without) but the service one should be a series of button pushing.      If anyone knows I would be most grateful.   Many thanks.

20090222130954AApsTiN	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	17 inch niche rims selling price?	I been having a set of niche fatboy rims. 17 inches. Everyone that sees them says if u sell them let me know. Well I'm wondering since 17's aren't poplular as the 20's and bigger are,what can I sell them for? I don't want to ask to low and lose possible money. They have fairly new tires and have slight wear on the rims themselves around the edges. Probally from curbs. But overall they are in great shape. So what should I ask for them?
20090222133312AAeYBQK	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Would Using the Defroster Cause A Burning Smell?	I was driving on the highway at highway speed with the defroster on. When I reached my destination, I smelled an odor, and the check engine light came on. When I started the car up again later, it took 3 tries to get it to start up.       Would the defroster cause the problem?   Because when it was not used the other day, an odor was coming through the vent, but not as strongly as this smell.
20090222142249AA9xb7j	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is there a good do-it-yourself book/manual I could buy that would help me to work on my 2006 VW GTI? UTI?	I am 17 years old and just bought a pre-owned 2006 VW GTI (oh yeah, it's a six speed manual tranny!). The only couple of shops around here are way overpriced and don't like to work on European cars. I barely trust them. I want to go to UTI and become an Auto Technician and I want a good base to start from. A guy at work suggested I find a book on my car that will help me do things such as oil changes and tune-ups to using a diagnostic tool to installing a stage II turbo. Is there any such book that could guide me through such processes? It doesn't have to be all inclusive of the said examples. I'm just dying to be able to work on my car and not have to bring it in to any shop. Thanks much!

In the divorce decree it states that the car we bought together would now be his and that he'd be responsible for the remaining balance on the loan.  My question is, how do we get my name of the loan and/or title of the car?  Do we need to contact the company the loan is through AND the DMV?  Or just one or the other?

20090222131538AAr5WT6	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	$100 Million for a 2009 Mercedes CLK-Class?	I was looking at the car prices on EBay, and some of them make no sense at all. They had a 2009 Mercedes Benz CLK-Class that was up for bidding, and the supposed "bidders" had raised the price up to $99,999,999.00!!! Now I'm curious to know what's behind these supposed "listings" that doesn't seem real and that do reflect a price that's way beyond the actual market price. And what about the highest "bidders" that do not seem to be actual actual individuals..? Does anybody have a clue of what is the purpose of these crazy listings?

20090222135641AAJlUve	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What are the laws about Rumble Seats for cars?	What exactly are the legalities of a rumble seat? Many cars that are now called 'classics' were available with these extra hidden {(exterior)} seats. However they have fallen out of favor, but were still used on some concept cars up through the 1960s. Besides the seatbelt-for-everyone laws, what laws regard the construction and use of Rumble Seats and the vehicles that have them? Remember, I am asking about Exterior Rumble Seats, -NOT- extended cab Pickup truck jump seats.

20090222135727AARMKVC	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1989 Buick Park Ave/ Solenoid problem?	I have a 1989 (or 1991, I can't remember) Buick Park Ave. that is not starting. It has a new (yes, charged) battery and newish starter. When I turn the car on, the interior lights, cd player, headlights, heat, air, wipers, etc. all work. But when I try to start it, nothing happens. It kind of "hums" but doesn't turnover or even struggle to turn over. Just silence. And the car does start sometimes. Completely at random, although usually when it's warmer outside. I've been told it's probably a loose connection to the solenoid. Or possibly needs a new ignition switch. Any other ideas? Anyone else ever have this problem?      Thanks in advance!

20090222141037AAw2pQN	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	How can i find a lost car?	about 8 years ago my dad left a car at a garage (owned by an acquaintance) with the agreement that if he could, the garage owner would sell the car and let my dad know and the garage owner would take a percentage of the proceeds of the sale-i don't know how, but my dad forgot that he left the car there. The car is a collectable ford capri and we are now trying to find out what happened to this car, my dad is still the legal owner and has the registration document, the garage owner 'can't remember' what happened to the car, is there anyway we can find out if it is still out there, and if so where?

I seem to get quite a bit of power that I don't see normally even when I have under a 1/4 of a tank.       So that means that it can't be a weight issue.      Could this mean a bad fuel pump or something?
