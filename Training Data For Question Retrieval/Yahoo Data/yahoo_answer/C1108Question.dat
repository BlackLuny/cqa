20090220195304AAb3fAp	Beauty & Style;Hair	A good brand of hairspray that won't make my hair "crunchy"?	Whenever i'm on stage for a performance of some sort, i have to hairspray the crap out of my hair to make sure the curls will hold.       Visually, it looks nice but my hair is what my friend calls "crunchy" because it is hard and covered in hair spray.       Now, i want to curl my hair for school and don't want that crunchy affect because I'm not going to be on stage. I just want something that is light and will hopefully make my curls last but keep them pretty and soft.       Any suggestions?

In an age were we all obsess about the shape of our butts, do you find yours to be a good cushion when you sit?   My friends has the most flat shaped behind and always complains of getting butt aches when she sits for more than 15 minutes! I've always had more of a bubble butt shape myself and guess I do find it to be quite cushy and comfortable when I sit on it!

I don't know what to do. Can anyone tell me what was the first line of mineral makeup was called? And, can anyone tell me who came after that or the names and order in which they came out. If that is asking too much, lol, then maybe just the names of all who came after the first line came out. One last question, sorry, which one is the best, price doesn't matter it's going to be a gift for my mother.

I play before school, at lunch, and after school and I dont ever really have a chance to change cuz my friends will just come and get me and we'll go to the gymnasium to play b ball or something, or I play soccer waiting for the bus in the halls. I wear guys t-shirts and I like that as well as hoodies, and some nice casual runners/street shoes, but I have had some trouble with the pants. I dont really like any tight jeans or anything clinging to me because it sticks when I sweat, and also it is just hard to move in. Recently, I have been wearing just track pants, sweats, or my basketball shorts. I dont like the shorts cuz it's winter, but the others just dont look very good either. I was consitering buying some looser huys jeans, but I'm afraid of what people will think about that. I dont want to look like I'm trying to look like a guy, but the girls clothes just arent working for me. What do you think I should do.      also, another problem I have with the baggy pants is that I have wide hips and shoulders so it looks like I am wayyy bigger than I actually am. I solved that problem on top by wearing a slimmer  syyle of t -shirt but I just dont know how I can feel confident and make good first impressions on people with the pants. It's winter so for a little while longer at least, I have to stick with the  pants:(         thanks

I have a sports banquet coming up in April and I've been looking for a cute dress to wear. I was thinking on this one, with black pumps and a silver necklace... something kind of Audrey Hepburn inspired. Do you like this dress? I'm really not sure.      One thing I particularly don't like is the back. It's shown on the same dress of a different color, but it's basically just a tie and I'd feel uncomfortable with something that easy for someone to come by and yank.      I might have it taken up a few inches, to be just above the knee. But I'd have to see it on first.      Yes or no on this dress?

My cousin wants to change her clothes since her mom finally allowed her to buy her own clothes at the mall. She wants my help but I'm very bad at fashion?   I'll give you an overview of her looks.   She's 13, 14 in two months.   She's around 5'2''?   She has a curvy figure?   She has morena skin, but she's Asian.    Dark hair, she's thinking of dying it darker.   She wants her new wardrobe to be like "little miss sunshine" as to say.   She wants to ease in, so people don't thing of her as a poser or something, so can you add some start-up outfits too?   We heard somewhere that the darker you are, the less colorful things you should wear? Is that true? Cause she loves wearing either colorful clothes or like a plain white summer dress.   Websites and pictures would be appreciated!

20090220202317AA6mU9q	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is it possible that my scalp is damaged?	My scalp has been hurting like hell the last few days. Well, a particular area in my scalp precisely. It feels like a lump for some reason. It hurts to lift even a little bit of hair. It itches like crazy. And the roots are crazy curled when the rest of my hair is straight. I relax my hair by the way. I can't even comb my hair. I'm thinking it's the fact that I place my hair roller a bit tight. I don't blowdry my hair. And i have a lot of hair, not joking by any means. It takes about two ladies two style my hair at the hair salon and one over stretched her wrist the last time. That same spot hurts whenever i relax my hair, or style it. I'm worried. My Ma thinks I'm overreacting but it truly aches and I don't know what to do. So A) is my scalp damaged and b) should I pay a visit to the Doctor? And any other info you can give would be great. Thank You.

One of the guys is about to chip onto the green when he sees a long funeral procession on the road next to the course. He stops in mid-swing, takes off his golf cap, closes his eyes, and bows down in prayer.      His friend says: “Wow, that is the most thoughtful and touching thing I have ever seen. You truly are a kind man.”      The man then replies: “Yeah, well we were married 35 years.”      2. Two guys are sitting on a bar stool. One starts to insult the other one. He screams, “I slept with your mother!” The bar gets quiet as everyone listens to see what the other weasel will do. The first again yells, “I SLEPT WITH YOUR MOTHER!”      The other says, “Go home dad you’re drunk.”

20090203092653AAp0T94	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Why is my skin always so red / blotchy?	I am so envious of anyone with effortlessly clear complexions!       My face is always red and blotchy in places, mostly at my jawline and either side of my nose. It's really obvious in photographs. I've tried all of the simple advice... drinking plenty of water throughout the day, moisturizing morning and night etc., but nothing has made a difference so far. I don't really want to have to trowel on foundation every day!      Does anyone else have this problem? I walk quite a lot (live in northern england, so mostly cold / windy at this time of year), I wondered if this could be causing it? And most of all, do you know a product I can use to get an even skin tone?      Appreciate any help, thanks :) x

20090220205914AAeL1De	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Do you find your butt to be a good cushion?	Serious question!   In human biology books it says one of the main reasons we all evolved curvy round-shaped butts was so that we had something that behaved as a cushion when we sat down on it.   In an age were we all obsess about the shape of our butts, do you find yours to be a good cushion when you sit?   My friends has the most flat shaped behind and always complains of getting butt aches when she sits for more than 15 minutes! I've always had more of a bubble butt shape myself and guess I do find it to be quite cushy and comfortable when I sit on it!   In your experience, do you feel that yours is like a comfortable cushion or not?   Love to hear your opinions, serious answers only though!

20090220210907AAHBoZE	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Cartilage Piercing Help?	I recently got two holes pierced in my upper cartilage done at a chemist.   The pain of the holes being made was excruciating (which i expected) although it hurt for a few days after and i couldnt touch it whatsoever, there was also alot of heat and swelling but no itching.The pain eventually subsided ALTOGETHER and i could even lay on it whilst sleeping.   After about 3 days i decided to take out the earrings to check if the holes were okay which resulted in a bit of bleeding.      Today, I did the same thing, (took the earrings out to check them) and i thought at first, wow there's no pain of unlocking the earrings (they come off as clips, not sliding) UNTIL i looked at my wrists and forearms and noticed that they were covered in blood. The impact of the clip of the earring (the quick pull) had made my ear GUSH out with blood and it splattered everywhere!! >.<"" The bleeding was non-stop for about five minutes but there was NO pain.      Should I be concerned?      EXTRA INFO: pierced on Tuesday 16/02-09 almost two weeks ago
