It is only just beginning but I think you will eventually find it to be a great resource to learn about eating in Thailand.  They include a new forum where they visit stalls, stands and restaurants around Thailand giving you a face-to-face look at how Thais and others enjoy Thai food.  They even say that they will be getting some recipes from popular places for particular dishes.<br>  "Have a wonderful time"|`|Vtcu0MV9aa	thats Amazing your Mum Will have a lOvley day your a Dribute to your Mother and Family (: xx|`|AkQFEPH6aa	Well i'm a vegetarian but if i was non veg that I'll say you have good taste of food especially the dessert.

Boiling veggies does boil out some of the nutrients. I'm not sure how much, but I know it does some.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	I have tried blanching, and it makes the veggies a little too tender for my taste. This is what I do and IMO works best. Put the veggies in a colander and pour a pot of boiling water over them. It will brighten the color (esp. if you use broccoli) and soften them just a tiny bit without losing any of the crunch. It also helps draw out a little bit of the water form the veggies so you don't end up with a soupy salad. Be sure to let them drain very well in the colander over a bowl in the fridge (at least one hour, I rec.) and pat dry with paper towel before using.|`|AA11765580	No, you don't have to cook the veggies at all.  They are supposed to go in the pasta salad as is.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I never blanch them.  The dressing will soften them a little bit.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Blanching refers to quickly cooking the veggies is boiling water, usually for less than 4 minutes.  I do this with broccoli, green beans and asparagus when using in a pasta salad.  Not sure which veggies you're using but below are some approximate times I use to blanch the following:<br>  <br>  Start with a pan of rapidly boiling water add the veggies, time them, drain quickly when done and plunge them into a cold water bath (a large bowl filled with ice water works great).<br>  <br>  Broccoli - 1.5 mins<br>  Green beans - 3 mins<br>  Asparagus - 1 min|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I put the veggies (cut into whatever size I want) into a pyrex pan; single layer, with about 1/4" water.  Cover with waxed paper and microwave about 2 min - just until they turn bright green and are still crunchy.  You won't lose any nutrients that way and they'll look really pretty|`|nOVSf06Raa	I use raw vegetables on the one that I make if you cook them they will not give you the look and the taste of a salad , I shred the carrots and set aside , chop green onions, celery , 1 green pepper, 1 red, 1 yellow  or orange , I use Mayonnaise for this  cook your pasta al dente it's better to have it firm for a salad, open 1 can of tuna if you like tuna , break it up into small pieces and add to the pasta  , add some black pepper and toss .|`|FhKfyxWlaa	You don't have to cook them or blanch them. I prefer raw veggies and their crunch. It's a great contrast to the spongey pasta. To blanch, put your veggies in boiling water for 2 minutes and then remove them and put them immediately into an "Ice bath" (ice water) to stop the cooking and keep the color on the veggies.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I've always just rinsed my veggies for pasta salad. Rinse in cool water before dicing. <br>  <br>  If you need to blanche in the future you just put the veggies in boiling water for about 30 seconds then pull them out and put them into an ice bath.|`|53giV6PFaa	I never blanche my veggies for pasta salads.  I just use as is.  The only "cooked" veggies I may add would be corn or peas.  Those are already blanched before they were frozen.

FhKfyxWlaa	It takes practice. And, you should never use this method for baking, because you need to be precise.|`|CeXKPtCRaa	It's all about experience...the more you work with something, the less you have to actually measure it to be accurate.  For bartenders, for example, sometimes they use a cadence or count in their head and count how many seconds they pour for.  After a while, they don't need to count. <br>  <br>  For cooks, if you see a tablespoon measure multiple times daily, after a while you'll know exactly how much a tablespoon is.

I used to be a little crazy about measuring things when I first started cooking, but now I tend to do a lot of eyeballing.<br>  <br>  In most baking, I wouldn't eyeball flour or anything like that, but I always eyeball things like vanilla which don't matter much.<br>  <br>  As for the weight watchers tip...I guess it's an ok reference point, but I could never use that, too many variations in the human hand and I'm a bit eyeballer anyway.<br>  <br>  So, as long as you're not baking, I would suggest that you practice eyeballing all you like. You'll get the hang of it.|`|MsgdDyeuaa	I always measure just to be on the safe side.  You can always go with this that I learned from weight watchers. <br>  Fist = 1 cup or 1 medium fruit<br>  Thumb (tip to base) = 1 ounce meat or cheese<br>  Thumb tip (tip to 1st joint) = 1 Tbsp<br>  Fingertip (tip to 1st joint) = 1 tsp<br>  Index finger (1st to 2nd joint) = 1 inch<br>  Cupped hand = 1-2 ounces of nuts of pretzels<br>  Palm (minus fingers) = 3 ounces of meat, fish or poultry|`|AA11742440	What I did was test myself - for example, I would pour what I thought was a half-teaspoon of salt into my (freshly washed, of course) hand, then carefully pour it into a measuring spoon. I was surprisingly accurate. But I wouldn't even try with larger amounts, like 'a half-cup of milk' or something like that. It doesn't take that long to measure it out correctly.|`|SYYO9LUDaa	I depends on the veggie.  For instance, a small onion diced equals about a 1 1/4 cup of onion.  If you give details on specific foods, any of the frequent cooks here can give you approximate amounts.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	learn when to eyeball and when to be precise.    In general, eyeballing is for cooking and precise measurements are for baking but there exceptions to that rule for both cooking and baking.<br>  <br>  You can eyeball the amount of spice or herbs going into a cooking recipe.   You can eyeball the amount of nuts of chocolate chips in a baking recipe. <br>  <br>  Keeping the liquid to dry to fat proportions is very critical in baking but can be fudged in cooking normally.|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Practice and a lot of cooking.

You should ALWAYS make time for breakfast or your body's natural 'disposal system' won't wake up. Lunch and Evening meal are the other two usual meals, one being the main 'cooked' meal. I usually have a sandwich & apple or soup for lunch and have dinner in the evening - usually includes some sort of meat, veggies & rice, pasta or potatoes.<br>  <br>  Some folks like to eat a snack inbetween meals and that's okay too as long as it's not a huge one. The main thing to do all day is to make sure you have lots to drink - water, juice, tea (even coffee has its good points!).<br>  <br>  The main thing that's bad for your digestive system is to eat loads late at night. When you're sleeping, your system needs to rest aswell and if you eat late at night you're not giving it time to take a break.

Feel free to visit my websites below, these may help find what you're looking for.|`|9NxrjFZTaa	start with chicken. its light and tasty.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	So let's see, you are feeling sick and your answer is to start eating high fat animal tissue! So consuming the steroids, antibiotics, tranquilizers, and hormones that they give the animals is supposed to make you healthy? Why did you even go vegetarian in the first place if this is your mentality about your health.<br>  <br>  A couple of years ago I was feeling dizzy for weeks. I went to the doctor. I had blood tests and vitamin checks done and I had cat scans. I then did a three day juice fast and I haven't been dizzy since. <br>  <br>  Why not try doing something logical like that instead of assuming that you need to poison yourself with dead animal carcasses. You obviously haven't been feeling like this for 7 years so that should tell you that it isn't the vegetarian lifestyle that's making you sick now!|`|BsfCZlMraa	Good for you making it as a vegetarian! <br>  Im not an expert but I think you have a lack or iron, maybe you could try taking some viatims so you are getting the nutrition you need. Another great source of iron is spinach! its about 40% iron I think.<br>  Also, you need viatimin B12 which is found in meat .. if you are planning to get pregant or sexually (50% of kids are accidents =P ) active it reduces your childs chance of having alot of complications due to underdeveloped spinal connection to the brain...|`|UejZWThIaa	Maybe your low on Iron/Protien or some other Vitamin that you need to replace since you no longer eat meat I was not always a Vegetarian but once I learned what I was doing and got used to the diet I found that if I went back to eating meat I got a bad stomach ache and because of that felt terrible, low on energy/tired you name it.<br>  <br>  I have been a true vegetarian since the middle of October 2008 of last year I have not had real meat since then at all and let me just say that I feel great and am loosing weight so maybe before you continue your diet or change it again I would go see a doctor I'm not one but I would just make sure your healthy maybe he/she can give you advice on the vegetarian diet since I have been a vegetarian I have only caught a cold once last year when I still ate meat I think don't really remember though and have not been to the doctor in a long time.<br>  <br>  There are many up sides to being a vegetarian but I would seek a doctors advice before you continue or eat meat again that is all I can say I hope I helped you and good luck.

F4wNs1eaaa	First, what kind of things is your daughter into?  Any particular music, TV shows, books, movies?  Then plan a theme around those interests. For example, if she and her friends are into Hip Hop music, she might like having everyone come dressed as Hip Hop Stars (have everyone make up an appropriate name for themselves, etc.).  Have her give you a list of her favorite music and that can be the party music.    <br>  <br>  As for food and beverages, finger foods seem to work best with teens and offering sparkling apple cider and sparkling grape juice alongside a few bottles of soda would be good.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to remember that it's her day and she should be involved in the party planning too :D

BWxSSADaaa	Can you tell us what dish it comes with?<br>  <br>  When I've been to Japanese restaurants, I've been given soy sauce, sweet soy sauce (kikkoman makes one, but you can make your own with soy sauce and sugar), and with tempura, a dipping sauce.  Here is a recipe for tempura dipping sauce: <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Tempura-Dipping-Sauce-97883" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Tempura-Dippin...</a><br>  <br>  Kikkoman also makes a tempura dipping sauce you can buy.  If you can tell the dish, I'm sure someone can give a better answer, but those are the only sauces I've had for dipping at a Japanese place.  The other three sauces I've had in general were sauces on yakitori meatballs and grilled eel, which were sweet.  There is also a sauce that usually comes on spicy tuna rolls, it's orange, usually a mix of sri racha hot sauce and mayo, sometimes mixed with orange fish roe.<br>  <br>  Hi Stacy: the only ginger sauce I've had at Japanese restaurants is an orange ginger sauce that is usually on salads.  Its really tasty.  Here is a recipe: <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Famous-Japanese-Restaurant-Style-Salad-Dressing/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Famous-Japa...</a> , and another one: <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Miso-Carrot-Sauce-With-Ginger-Japanese-Salad-Dressing-193126" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Miso-Carrot-Sa...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know if that type of sauce is what you're looking for, but it is tasty if you like ginger.

32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	If you want to be able to cook rice alone, quickly and often, get a rice cooker. It is different from a slow cooker (crock pot). A slow cooker doesn't cook anything fast. Slow cookers are great, but they are best used for one-dish meals like red beans and rice, stews, meat (like a roast or chicken) and veggies. They take at least a few hours to cook when used on the high setting, to 7 or 8 hours when used on the low setting. It's all about slow cooking on low heat, it makes meat very tender. But they are not a good way to cook rice alone, not quickly anyway.|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	How much space do you have at the back of your kitchen cabinets?

Save your money.|`|URZeQfQCaa	Saucepan + boil in bag = 10 minutes and less cost.|`|56VRs1GFaa	The two are not interchangeable. A slow cooker doesn't give the necessary heat required to cook rice. I have both, and if you eat a lot of rice a rice cooker is indispensable. But, then so is a slow cooker. Put your stew, chili or pot roast fixings in it before leaving for work and when you get home you have a hot meal waiting. Hope this helps.|`|1028359a77d037af7289c09546a08b7eaa	I use my microwave to cook rice, and it comes out perfect every time.<br>  I just measure out the rice into a mug, pour in 2 1/2 times the amount in hot boiled water, put into the microwave for 20 mins, job done!  If you want to flavour the rice, add a few Cardamom pods to the rice/water mixture, but remove them before serving.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	depends upon what setting you put the slow cooker on. I have this big one that i put some chicken in while I went to bed, man I had charcoal in a pot when I got up. maybe that was because the knob was off, could be why someone gave it to me, but really that thing could cook a whole hog's head. jus jokin|`|MQZxIEasaa	Mine is a slow cooker, rice cooker, and steamer in one.

It does a fantastic job on rice and also steams vegetables.  You can get a decent one for around $20.  Slow cookers are also great and very versatile but I don't think I would cook rice in one.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Get a slow cooker first. You can do so many different things in it.<br>  <br>  Unless the majority of your diet is rice, you won't be using a rice cooker much and it will end up just sitting in the cupboard.<br>  <br>  Learn to cook rice in the microwave and it is faster than a rice cooker (and every bit as good) and it's easier to wash up just a pyrex dish than have to clean a rice cooker.|`|53giV6PFaa	I never cook just rice in a slow cooker and will never do it either.  It will not steam your rice like a rice cooker, it will just be a big glop of mush.  Stick with a rice cooker or stove-top for cooking just plain rice. I make rice on a weekly basis (I'm Asian and eat a lot of rice) so a rice cooker is awesome if you eat rice quite a bit.

It's the little things that you do or don't do that can effect the outcome.|`|jrBMC3eDaa	I prefer baking with fresh butter(unsalted)  I just like the pureness of it, and I'd have to agree that if you are using salted butter, either lessen the amount of salt, or omit it, which is what I do.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I used to think it didn't matter. I started baking with unsalted butter and noticed a subtle difference. The choice is yours.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	It can make a difference.  If the recipe calls for unsalted butter and salt, but you use salted butter, the recipe can be too salty.  If all you have is salted, just reduce the amount of salt in the recipe.<br>  <br>  BTW, producers started adding salt in the first place because it made it more difficult to tell if the butter was rancid.  Nice, huh?

QWY0P98Haa	Good for you for cooking dinner....<br>  Just leave the lumps in, your family will appreciate that you took the time to make fresh mashed potatoes and the lumps are just the proof of that.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Well you may have glue by now. You could use a ricer for super smoth potatoes or even shred them with a grater after you have boiled them if you want super fine taters. I prefer a few lumps myself.<br>  <br>  Let me give you a few mashed potato tips.<br>  <br>  Mashed Potato Tips:<br>  1. Start with russets, Idaho etc.. Just a plain basic potato, no need for red potatoes, or Yukon golds etc… Just stay with the classics here.<br>  2. Don't over boil the potatos the way to tell when they are done is just when a fork can be poked all the way thru a potato with out any force.<br>  3. Drain well or you will have a thin watery mashed potato.<br>  4. When you emtpy your potatos back into the bowl to mash, weather you hand mash or use a mixer just mash the potatos and seasonings without the butter and milk first. Then when you get the consistentcy you want add some milk and butter and stir/fold it in. Potatos can sometimes get a glue like consistentcy due to the starch, mixing them "dry" frist helps to prevent that.<br>  <br>  Seasoning ideas.<br>  <br>  I like to use white pepper in my potatos, but don't use as much it's very strong.<br>  <br>  I also like garlic powder/salt, onion powder/salt, and celery salt.<br>  <br>  If they taste a little bland add a dash or two more salt, the salt helps to bring out the buttery, creamy-ness of the potatos.<br>  <br>  Cream is good in mashed, and I also like to use evaporated milk, it has a nice consistncy with out being to overboard and is realtvly cheap.<br>  <br>  You can also add cream cheese, ricota cheese, sour cream, and I haven't trie d fets yet but now I want to. Buttermilk is good too.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  A good recipe for left over mashed taters.<br>  <br>  1/2 cup flour<br>  1/4 tsp salt<br>  1 egg lightly beaten<br>  1 tsp baking powder<br>  1 cup mashed potatoes-warmed just a bit<br>  1 tsp dried parsely<br>  <br>  Mix everything together and form into little round balls, then fry in hot oil, drian and enjoy.<br>  <br>  Or you can make these into potato pancakes and just mash the balls flat.<br>  Good luck and enjoy.<br>  <br>  If you really want to use red taters for mashed here is a recipe we used to use at my Mother in laws restaurant. I haven’t had them in ages and they sure do sound good right now, just something different.<br>  <br>  2 lbs red potatoes-quartered<br>  1 ? tbsp mashed potatoes<br>  3 tbsp butter<br>  1 cup sour cream<br>  <br>  Boil taters with skin on until tender. Drain and mash with the remaining ingredients. <br>  <br>  You do want to make sure you at these up right away though. They just don’t do as good as left overs and definiltly get gluey very easily.|`|7cUDstdjaa	I think you need to cook the potato a bit longer. Next time, take one out of the water when you think it's cooked and see how easily it mashes. If it doesn't, cook then for another 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  This time though, I suggest you put it all into a blender.<br>  <br>  Some types of potato don't mash well, try King Edwards next time.<br>  Good Luck|`|t5xnbgKkaa	Stop mashing before the potatoes go starchy. The bst way to get perfect mashed potato is to use a potato ricer which is a metal sieve with a press..you can get them from any good cook shop or,more cheaply, from ebay. Which is of no help to you right now. So..get a  freezer or sandwich bag, the bigger the better, and one quarter fill it with the potato,shake it to the bottom and them use a rolling pin ( or a sauce bottle if you don't have a rolling pain) to squash out the lumps,repeat until all the potato is ready and then put it into an oven proof dish, dot with butter or grated cheese and pop in into a hot oven for fifteen or twenty minutes until the top is just beginning to be crispy and golden..no one will guess that this was not what you meant to make in the first place. If you have no bags to use then get a sauce bottle and clean the bottom of it then use it like a pestle to squash the potato down in its bowl and heat up in the same way.|`|9pLI73pqaa	You may not have cooked them long enough.

Besides being lower in fat, it's just tastier.

Remember not to handle the burger too much because this can wear it out. For cheese, I like to put cheddar slices on the burger while it's still on the grill just long enough to melt the cheddar. Then I put them on buns with lettuce, tomato, and mustard...yum.

UM2RvgAgaa	The cinnamon roll is thought to have been invented in Sweden where it takes the name kanelbulle (literally: "cinnamon bun").|`|bn8OZrYSaa	cinnamon rolls are common in North America and Northern Europe.<br>  <br>  <br>  As with so man of these things, it's hard to say. Food historians like to argue the Greeks and Romans, but then they always argue that don't they? Honestly I sometimes think there's a food historian out there who'd claim the Macedonians invented the first haggis spring roll. In truth there's very scant evidence that the Greeks and Romans cooked with cinnamon (they mostly burned it as incense), much less rolled it up in dough sheets and covered it with icing. Nope, to find a true cinnamon bun, we need to look much later on the culinary timeline, to a period when not only cinnamon, but things like butter and especially sugar were commonplace. That puts us in the Age of Exploration at the earliest, more likely the colonial period, when sugar production in the Caribbean was at its height and widely available to the masses. Let's say around the mid-1700's. <br>  <br>  This was also the time when Northern European bakers had truly mastered super-rich, butter-infused yeast doughs. They were shaped into buns by the French (brioche) and fried in oil by the Dutch (doughnuts). Thus it seems only natural that in time they were combined with cinnamon sugar and rolled up and sliced, as they were by the Germans, Swedes and English who invented Schneken, kanelbulle and Chelsea buns, respectively...all of them antecedents to what we in North American now know as the cinnamon roll.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	Most cakes they make here in Spain contain cinnamon or canela as it is in Spanish.

CeXKPtCRaa	400F 204C for about 15 minutes, pound it out so it cooks evenly and quickly.  Oil can be added but is not necessary, I would advise against it.<br>  <br>  I see you cut them up already and breaded them, so it would be hard to give you a cooking time based on not being able to control the size and thickness of your chicken.  The shortest amount of time would probably be around 10-15 minutes, just check then to see if they are done, and if not, just leave 'em in a bit longer.  If you really want them crispy, you can broil them until they are brown (remember broiling is top heat so you will have to flip them), then lower the heat to maybe 350F (175C) and cook about 5-15 minutes until they are done, depending again on the thickness of your chicken.|`|2fYyw4LBaa	After you bread them... cook in oven on 350 for about 25-30min... on middle rack.  check them at 25min  to see if they're still a little raw or not.

Not everyone is a red wine drinker, so have some white wine on hand as well...a nice chardonnay or pino grigio is good.<br>  Also, for the person who like a little sweeter...a nice blush.<br>  Your liquor store that has a good selection of wine should be able to help you make some good choices.<br>   Don't forget to use the proper glasses!<br>  <br>  As for other drinks, you sound like you want to have a classy get together.<br>  Some drink ideas....(you can also make these in a pitcher)<br>  <br>  Cosmopolitan...Vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice and a splash of lime.<br>  serve in a martini glass with a slice of lime hanging on the side.<br>   <br>  Sex on the Beach..both apple and peach schnapps, orange and cranberry juice. serve on ice in a long drink glass with a garnish (put a pretty pick through cherry and through the top of an orange slice.<br>  <br>  Some guests will like just classic drinks...so maybe have on hand..<br>  <br>  Vodka, Rum, Bourbon...<br>  <br>  Orange juice, cranberry juice and soft drinks (cola, 7-up)<br>  <br>  Have a great  party and please remember...don't let your guests drink and drive....arrange a taxi if necessary, or have someone to stay sober and drive all the partiers home!|`|LsvPNA2Faa	vodka redbull, and drink it with a draw, u will get drunk faster ( the fact that u r drinking with a draw , the flavour of the alcohol is by pass from the tongue down ur throat, basically ur  not tasting it, make it go down easier. and makes u feel u r dirnking less but actually much much more,<br>  <br>  <br>  did i go off the subject ?lol|`|RQdFRaANaa	Shiraz / syrah is popular amongst me and my friends.

Turn on the heat.  Add your popcorn.  Remember it will 'grow' a lot, so don't add too much first time.  Put on the lid and shake it a little bit here and there, to keep corn from burning. (don't make the heat extremely high).  When it starts to pop, it will go wild, just keep shaking the pan to mix it up.  <br>    When done, I have melted butter ready and pour it over the top, and salt it , while shaking it to mix everything up.<br>    Simple.|`|zjFMdPOiaa	1 cup popcorn kernels<br>  1/2 cup vegetable or other oil<br>  Put into pan on med heat, cover.<br>  Shake the pan every few minutes before and during the popping.<br>  When it stops popping, remove from pan, garnish and serve.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	How to make popcorn on youtube. . . .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvqPjAN668U&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvqPjAN66...</a><br>  <br>  . . .you can click right for others if you prefer.<br>  <br>  You can buy popping corn at your supermarket, it's ready to pop.

Then add 1 tablespoon of popcorn to the sizzling oil. The heat in the oil will cause the kernal to Pop into popcorn.(popcorn is not corn on the cob nor frozen corn). <br>  The popkorn has to be shaken as its cooking to prevent burning. It takes 3-5 minutes to pop all the kernels. Be careful not to burn the Popped corn.<br>  If you have microwave pocorn there is a UPside and a DOWNside on the bag. The downside must be placed facing down as it has the heating element that will react to the microwave. Put it in the microwave down side down. Set the micro to Full power for 2.5 minutes. and watch the bag. some micros have a popkorn settign if yours does, then use that instead.<br>  popcorn in a micro can burn quickly and it will get smoky if not watched carefully when cooking on full power. <br>  Typically what happens is it take a while for the first kernel to Pop open. Once that occurs many will pop at once. When the popping action slows down to 1 pop every 2 seconds,. its done and time to take it out of the micro.<br>  other options. go to the grocery store and buy Jiffy Pop.<br>  Its a tinfoil container that you can cook over an open campfire or on the stove top(at medium heat- follow the cooking directions on the jiffy pop container) to get a bowl of popcorn.<br>  There is a hot air popper available. it sits on your countertop and blows really hot air. the kernels pop from the heat.<br>  those are few ideas.<br>  In todays world, easiest to most difficult is: microwave is easiest followed by hotair is more difficult followed by jiffy pop and finally cooking on the stove.|`|OGLOz9VUaa	By the corn and put it in a pot with some oil but remember to put a lid on.

jHcblhmVaa	My goodness, if you are making a stew, you are going to cook it for a long time.  Right? Why would you need to take something that is frozen and thaw it out before you cook it for an extended time? As long as you are not in a hurry put the chicken in frozen.  Slow cooking lets the flavors mingle.  If this is slam bam knock it out. Defrost it. If you are going to simmer it for hours not to worry. You should be cooking it till the meat falls off of the bones.  If you do that why would you be concerned?|`|XHnpraaxaa	Toss it into a crock pot and cook it slowly until fork tender,  It will work out just fine.  I cook roast this way from straight from the freezer.  They turn out nice and tender and chicken will do the same.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	no , thaw it !|`|kQcvnhdSaa	It wont be a problem as long as the chicken is cooked properly. The reason that its not advisable to cook chicken from frozen is that it makes it more difficult to ensure it is cooked properly. <br>  If you have a food thermometer then you should aim for a temperature of at least 74°C in the middle of the meat. I would imagine if you are doing a stew and cooking for a hour or so then this shouldnt be a problem. <br>  <br>  If you were roasting a semi frozen whole chicken you could find that part of it is fully cooked while some pieces are still raw. Its all to do with latent heat, how much heat is required to defrost and cook compared to just cook. Thats the danger<br>  <br>  Also you may find the chicken is a bit tougher  and stringier than if it was defrosted totally first|`|3jXPqUFjaa	I cook frozen chicken all the time in the crock pot.......<br>  <br>  I put it in with all the seasonings and leave it for the time required....it actually is moister due to the moisture from being frozen. <br>  <br>  If I use chicken breast in dishes, I thaw partially in the microwave and then slice or cut it when it is  partially frozen....alot easier to work with.....I have been cooking 30 yrs and never had issues doing it this way !!!!|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	You aren't supposed to in a crock pot (but we all do)<br>  <br>  I cook it semi-frozen all the time.

I wanted one of those old Italian grandmother recipes.  I finally found one.  I watched a Throwdown with Bobby Flay last week and saw an episode on meatballs.  I tried the recipe and it was awesome.  I did make a change in it, because I just cannot do a recipe without some experiementation :o)<br>  <br>  I used only 3 eggs, because that seemed like enough amount of liquid without having to have the 4th.  You can add the other one if you like a really moist meatball.  I used the ground chuck which I normally do a mixture of pork, veal, chuck.  This time I just used the chuck - you can use whatever meat you have on hand.  Since your meats are leaner than the chuck, I would go ahead and use the 4th egg.  I browned them in a skillet first and finished baking them in the oven and flipped them once during the oven cooking.  They were awesome.  The fresh herbs and spices is the key in this one.  You can buy packets of these at your market.  <br>  <br>  Grandma Maronis Meatballs 100 Year Old Recipe<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  1 pound ground chuck <br>  4 ounces dried bread crumbs <br>  4 large eggs <br>  4 ounces whole milk <br>  6 ounces grated Romano <br>  3 ounces grated Spanish onion <br>  2 ounces finely diced fresh garlic <br>  2 ounces finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves <br>  2 ounces finely chopped fresh basil leaves <br>  Directions<br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with olive oil cooking spray. <br>  <br>  Mix all ingredients thoroughly in large bowl.

Add any seasonings you desire (salt, pepper, parsley, oregano, garlic, etc.).<br>  <br>  If you want them to be really uniform, you can either deep fry them and finish them in the oven, or just bake them.  I like the taste from a pan fry (have about 1/4-1/2 inch of oil in the pan) but if you want uniformity, you'll probably have to use the oven.  Mix them for as little time as possible, the less you handle them, the better.<br>  <br>  Also, you can finish them in the sauce, but that's only if you want the flavor in the sauce in them or you want the outside to soften.  I wouldn't advise completely cooking them in sauce (from the start) because they would have no color and just have a boring texture.|`|jWk72GNSaa	Do as Culinary says. I don't know what's in your recipe, but the <br>  crumbs will make a firmer ball. You'll at least a small flat spot, <br>  but it won't be even noticable if you bake them HOT at first to set<br>  the shape and turn down the heat to complete the cooking. It's <br>  sort of like when you sear a steak. That being said, you can also<br>  fry them hot at first, but you'll need to keep them rolling around to <br>  get an even browning and the same shape-setting effect. <br>  <br>  Seasonings I would add: S&P, garlic, parsley flakes, onion (either <br>  powdered or finely chopped fresh stuff)|`|ZeTtadY0aa	i use a food processor and mince a whole bunch of parsley, a lot of garlic and a little olive oil. i add that to the beef with an egg and a little bread crumbs, maybe 1/2 cup or so. also, salt n pepper to taste.

23b127352bec969c4abbafa63dd0917eaa	Exactly what Michael said,<br>  I don't know why most people are saying yes as the chances of it being vegan are very low. Being vegan and eating out is difficult, it's always best to find out where caters for vegans first. So you know there's definetely something on the menu you can have.<br>  <br>  Most vegetarian sausages contain milk and/or egg. I doubt that this one will be an exception. It's likely the bread isn't vegan as many contain either egg or some form of milk product.<br>  <br>  Alcohol also is generally not vegan. I know it's easy to forget about what you're drinking and just think of what you're eating.<br>  <br>  You can always phone the pub and ask if they have anything vegan available.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	You need to find out if they glaze their bread with egg, but you don't make bread with egg.<br>  <br>  Mind you, it does use fat/marge to make bread you need to find out what they made it with as it was my understanding vegans don't eat dairy products such as butter or marge.

hHCdXq0Naa	The ribs should cook long and slow;  and the canned veggies just need to be heated up (or they'll disintegrate).   I'd do a dry rub on the ribs (lots of chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, salt & pepper) and then bake them at 300 on a foil-lined pan, covered with foil, for about 2-3 hours (depending on weight).  You can uncover the last 30 min or so, and baste with BBQ sauce, if you want, or just serve it on the side. ...

Why not try a ROUX.  Roux is a simple mixture of equal parts fat (like butter or olive oil) and flour.  You cook the two together and add any flavour liquid - this makes a gravy like consistancy.  You can make it as thick or thin as you like.  <br>  <br>  Here's how <br>  <br>  1. Melt some butter, shortening, oil, or other fat in a heavy skillet over very low heat. <br>  <br>  2. Gradually sprinkle the hot melted fat with the same proportion of flour and immediately begin stirring. <br>  <br>  3. Stir the mixture constantly until it reaches your desired color ( light coloured has less flavour, dark has more. <br>  <br>  4. Your mixture will be quite thick - this is when you add the liquid: add it slowly and mix untill all is incorporated. Any liquid will do: water, any flavour stock (fish stock is good with pasta) even brewed tea or coffee depending on the flavour you are looking for. NOTE:  If you are just using water you'll want to add some spices, herbs or flavouring to your roux otherwise it will just taste like flour!<br>  <br>  Remove from the heat and continue stirring until it has cooled down a bit and there's no risk of burning. <br>  <br>  Tips: <br>  A dark roux will thicken less than light roux. <br>  If black specks appear in the roux, it has burned and you'll have to start over. <br>  If roux is made ahead and refrigerated, pour excess oil from the surface before reheating, or let it return to room temperature. <br>  You can add anything to this mixture; veggies, pasta meat etc.  I use this mixture whenever I make chicken pot pie.  It can be awsome.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Eating!|`|AA10928232	sbu chicken stock for the milk in this recipe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Olive Garden Spaghetti Carbonara<br>  <br>  1/4 C. flour <br>  1/4 C. butter<br>  1 qt. milk <br>  1/8 tsp. pepper <br>  1/2 tsp. salt <br>  24 slices extra thick bacon, fried until crisp, then cut into ?” slices<br>  1/4 C. olive oil <br>  3 C. mushrooms, sliced <br>  6 Tbsp. scallions, finely minced <br>  1 lb. spaghetti, uncooked <br>  2 tsp. fresh parsley, finely chopped <br>  1/2 C.

PYiQGwsAaa	Batter was to runny, it needs to be more like wallpaper paste, not watery like when doing pancakes|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Your fish monger was wrong.<br>  <br>  Defrost the fish all the way.<br>  The dusting is the best way.<br>  Then make sure your batter is a good consistency.<br>  <br>  The next tips are very Important:<br>  <br>  Make sure your oil is the right temp-350 is ideal, don;t let anyone talk you into anything higher OR lower. 350 is he mgic number when it comes to frying.<br>  <br>  When you add the fish or any wet battered food for that matter hold it in the oil for about 10 seconds before you release it.  This helps to seal it up and avoid sticking to fryer element and to other pieces of fish you add later.<br>  <br>  I use a beer batter and here is my recipe:<br>  <br>  Beer batter:<br>  1 cup flour<br>  1 palm full salt<br>  1 small pinch salt<br>  1 beer-what ever flavor you normally have around<br>  <br>  Mix the dry ingredients and the slowly add the beer. It will foam up as you add the beer just keep whisking. The consistency you want depends on how you like your breading, more breading of course a thicker batter and almost a little fluffier. For a thinner crunchier batter then you of course want a thinner batter. I like min a medium thickness.<br>  <br>  Then dredge the frying food in plain flour first then the beer batter. Gently wipe the tip of the dipped item on the edge of the bowl, it will re-coat as gravity makes it run down and coat perfectly.<br>  <br>  Lower the food in the hot oil and hold on to it for about 10 seconds, this helps to keep it from sticking to the bottom, other pieces being fried, and the heating element if you a frier.<br>  <br>  Fry until golden brown and it floats.<br>  Drain on paper towels or brown paper bags laid out on a plate or cookie sheet. You can pop them in the oven on warm as you fry all the batches.|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Your batter mix did not have the correct consistency (stickyness)  also you should defrost the fish to release excess moisture otherwise that also leads to loss of batter.|`|jHcblhmVaa	You can't fry frozen fish!  Thaw it out completely the ice crystals in the meat are causing the problems.  You are lucky that you didn't get splattered. Clean out the fryer and try again.

Filter it if you do.|`|bcb975a6a5422a999658b591957e3b9faa	yr fish should b completely defrosted & the oil must be heated well then don't turn it every now & then give each side around 5 min (after u stop hearing the splashing of the oil then this side is done)|`|CeXKPtCRaa	First of all, make sure you shake off any excess flour.  Any excess will cause the batter to stick to the flour and not the fish, causing it to fall off.  The flour is just to try the outside of the fish so the batter will stick. <br>  <br>  Second of all, the batter stuck because it didn't cook on the outside before it came into contact with anything else.  With tongs, lightly swirl the fish in the oil first for maybe 10 seconds to start to set the crust on the outside - then you can let it go.<br>  <br>  Your fish may have been too delicate for frying, but if your fish monger said it was okay, then you may have cooked the fish too long.  Bring your temperature up another 10 or 20 degrees.  This will set the crust faster, and your fish shouldn't take too long to cook anyway.  Setting the crust will prevent the fish from falling apart, and give you a better product.<br>  <br>  To the above poster...that's interesting, because my pancake batter isn't watery, and my fish batter is never anywhere near that thick.

You will need to plan it the night before and be up before her. It doesnt matter if what you do isnt what she normally has to eat she will just be thrilled to get a treat. The important thing is to make it look nice.  Get a tray and put a cloth on it, table napkin will do.  Add a vase with a flower or two -daffodil buds out of a garden would be great. Add fruit juice, tea and toast and put the birthday cards on the tray when you take it in.  Then leave her alone to eat and enjoy - while you get ready.  Make sure you clear up the kitchen. If you can bring her a smiley helium balloon too.<br>  <br>  If there is something she usually nags you about everyday (like leaving on time?) then do it right on this day just to keep her feeling happy.<br>  <br>  Also you could make her a birthday cake.  Make sure you have all the ingredients in the house. Shut her out the kitchen the night before and get baking.  Decorate the cake the night before - or when you get in on the Monday and do the happy birthday thing.<br>  <br>  Other things you can do is to send her a text during the day, and send an ecard to her (try hallmark web site).<br>  <br>  As for presents - thats hard, you really will have to look around and see what she likes using that you could buy.

You can frost and/decorate any way you like.<br>  <br>  Giant Hostess Cupcake<br>  2 batches of chocolate cake layers (4 layers, total)<br>  1 batch vanilla cream filling<br>  1 batch rich chocolate frosting (recipe below)<br>  <br>  Take all four (cooled) chocolate cake layers and level the domed tops using a large, serrated knife. Using a large biscuit cutter, or a paring knife, cut an approx. 5-inch circle from the center of each of two of the cake layers.<br>  Stack one uncut layer on a cake plate or serving tray and place the two center-less layers on top of it. Fill the center of the cake with the vanilla cream filling. Reserve about 1-2 tbsp of filling to make the squiggle on top of the cake.<br>  <br>  Place final uncut layer on top of the filling to seal it in.<br>  <br>  Frost entire cake with a thin layer of rich chocolate frosting. Using a large offset spatula will give you the smoothest finish.<br>  <br>  Place reserved vanilla filling into a plastic bag and cut off the corner. Pipe filling onto top of the cake in a squiggly line to finish.<br>  <br>  Cake can be refrigerated or kept at room temperature.<br>  Serves 16-20.<br>  <br>  Rich Chocolate Frosting<br>  1/4 cup butter<br>  1 cup chopped semisweet chocolate (or chocolate chips)<br>  1 1/2 cups confectioners’ sugar<br>  1/4 cup milk (lowfat is fine)<br>  1 tsp vanilla extract<br>  <br>  Melt together butter and chocolate in a medium-sized, microwave safe bowl.

DT2mU1jOaa	Yes.<br>   Why so contrite with my answer. Well I am not just direct because it is another case of personal taste and preference. In food and beverage tastings it is recommended that a person first sample the lighter bodied and lighter flavored items first. There are two main reasons for this first, the perceptions of foods are partially masked by others. When tasting a food/beverage subtle flavors are important in discerning a degree of the tradesman's skills and judging merit. Certain heavy flavors can mask these flavors in both the social or competition settings. Therefore, sampling the lighter items first allows for its full merits to be discerned.<br>  The second reason is something called flavor or sensory fatigue. Our palates can receive and discern chemicals quite well but fades over time. Much research has gone into why the sensory levels of taste fades overtime. It boils down to small chemical transmitters which become depleted thus no more signal can be sent. {sorry, I understand this can be deep and that my attempt here may be concise and even confusing.} Basically, our sense of taste is lost with repeatable consuming of an food item.<br>  <br>  <br>  A good question is why not is flavor lost in certain foods such as snack foods? The answer is that is does but is is to a lesser degree than with liquids. Also in alcoholic beverages the alcohol itself has an anesthetizing affect on our taste receptors numbing them so we can no longer taste.<br>  <br>  <br>  Subtle falvors first...<br>  Change food items & cleans palate-water...<br>  Alcohols numbing affects on taste...|`|8OREBeRdaa	I've been to a beer fests, chatted w/ brew-masters, and had numerous samplings.  You can go from a dark beer to a light beer. You just need to be a bit more open minded to the fact that darker beers tend to have more flavor and fuller body (such as a Dark ale or Scotch ale) in comparison to a lager or Pilsener.<br>  <br>  Also, Lighter beers don't "hit you less" than dark beers.  That's a pile of crap unless you're specifically talking about flavors.  Lighter beers tend to be a little crisper and bubblier than darker beers.  If you're concerned about alcohol effects then you need to be looking at the alc % / vol. <br>  <br>  I know that when I've gone to beer samplings, many people suggested to cleanse your palette with some water (bottle water is fine).  You don't want it to be cold, so cool to warm is good.  I tend to do this when I move from tasting a dark beer (or a stout) to a lighter beer and I can still pick up the subtleties that the light beer has to offer.|`|RQdFRaANaa	Sure. Not long ago I was at a beer tasting with lots of dark and heavy beers. After bunches of IPAs and dunkels, I had a Coors Light. It was great because it was such a nice change of pace.|`|TLzknS0eaa	Yes ,especially when the dark beer tastes like pond scum.|`|RatImysqaa	You can drink beer in any manner you wish but it is preferably better to go from light to dark.|`|TeY6Q2gpaa	You can but it will often make the lighter beer have a bit of an off taste.|`|FVFT1oXMaa	Hey, Mayor Adam West is that you?|`|AA11307468	Oh, absolutely!  Every year I go to a local event called the Brewer's Fest.  Brewery's from all over the regional area come with their different brews.  I would say there are maybe 50 or so different beers that you can try.  They have everything from the palest ale to the darkest stout.  It is not uncommon to switch to a lighter beer after trying one or two of the stouts.  Stouts have stronger flavors and they are also heavier and tend to fill you up faster than lighter beers.  And even a light tasting ale has a distinct enough taste that it is unaffected by any aftertaste from the stout.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	If you drink darker beers (I'm assuming you mean "stronger" beers), then the lighter beers (assuming you mean pilsners like Bud), the lighter beers will have much less taste and you won't be affected as much by them.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean you won't still like them though.  I very much enjoy ales and dark lagers, but also like Bud light.<br>  <br>  A tip:  if you're planning on drinking some of both on the same day, drink the stronger first.  If you have an ale/lager, then follow with Bud, the Bud almost has a sweet flavor!
RatImysqaa	Yes and no because beers can be tricky in this way. Dark beers appears to be heavy in satiating and alcohol by their appearance. But in many cases we find certain beers such as stouts contain less alcohol than many lighter beers. For example, compare a stout to a bock and we see that the bock which can be the lighter Mai bock style, is heavier in both mouthfeel and alcohol content. Yes the dark beer is going to be more difficult to drink all night do to its satiating acrid flavors. Other beers such as IPA, Pale Ales, and Octoberfest can also have more alcohol but not be as heavy in the mouth.|`|DT2mU1jOaa	Every answer that I read is correct. You must understand the ambiguity of your question. You might try to ask it again in a more specific way. For example you you might ask, "Is the alcohol content in dark beers greater than lighter/light beers?" Yet I also believe that we basically understand your thinking here and thus offer up our thoughts. Mine?<br>  <br>  Yes, dark beer is stronger. I say this because of the flavor of the beer. Few light-lighter  colored beers have the same intense flavor impact as beers brewed to the specifications of dark beers. The alcohol issue has been addressed and I agree that some lighter beers have a greater alcohol concentration than the darker beers. But this is a seesaw battle and one on debates of style guidelines. So I say it comes down to the overall impression a beer gives to the drinker. Dark beers are  more heavy on the palate when considering flavor intensity  and its drinking satiating effects.|`|cyFqjkolaa	Not necessarily.  Color had little to do with alcohol content.  All it has to do with is flavor and brewing.<br>  <br>  There are some light color beers that can knock you for a loop.|`|AA11307468	Dark beers have stronger flavors than their lighter counterparts.  They don't necessarily have greater alcohol content, though I believe they are capable of having greater alcohol content, depending on the regulations for beer in your regional area.|`|AA12185092	No. There are stouts at 4% ABV and pale brews at 10%. The only thing you can consistently expect from dark beers is the flavor of dark-roasted malt. And even that doesn't necessarily hold for some mass-market darks that use caramel color.|`|sDKCX43caa	No they are brewed to different strengths like the others.<br>  It could be just a local thing if your dark beers appear to have higher levels.|`|K1iUzewyaa	Yeah.. I thought darker beers usually contain more hops, etc, and make it a little stronger.. Heineken Dark Lager is pretty good.. but both are equally strong...|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Color doesn't necessarily determine strength, its more about the style of beer.|`|bYfa7a4iaa	Wasn't my idea.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	1.  Both are commonly ordered at a bar.  Mixed drinks will likely be more enjoyable to a first timer than beer, as it is an acquired taste.<br>  <br>  2.  Rum and coke, whiskey sour (or amaretto sour, if you prefer sweeter with less alcohol), long island iced tea (if you want a lot of alcohol in a single drink), tequila sunrise, and a shot of something (I suggest tequila or whiskey)<br>  <br>  3.  This depends on how long you're going to be out drinking.  I'd say a good limit would be 5 for a whole evening out.  Space them out, give each one time to take effect before deciding if you want another, and when you're not drinking alcohol sip some water.  Dehydration is a big part of a hangover.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|9ba0a7a6fd65e46f7bfb77cddb7e5904aa	if you never drank before i would stick with beer and as far as how many well thats hard to tell, you would just have to see lol, but no i would stay around 3 beers or drink what you like just check the abv on it, most guys i know drink beer when they go out same with the women im the weird one in my town i like mixed drinks or wine coolers, so i drink those i dont care what people think but let me just say you turning 21 get plastered lol thats what the night is all about so happy birthday and have fun its the only time you can look back and say ya know i dont remember much but i know i had fun just make sure if your single your friends dont let you go home with a dog lol|`|IawZ34MXaa	If you have never drank before. Stick to beer. Some of your friends will be out to get you trashed and if you order a mixed drink they will ask the bar keep to give it a double shot. Aslo if you don't want to get drunk do not drink any shots but if they talk you into shots go with some weaker shots. Tell them you will only do Root Beer Barrels which is root beer schnapps and keg beer. They are good. <br>  <br>  BTW I would go with 2 beer an hour max and stop at 6 if your feeling a good buzz. If your not feeling anything go with 2 more.|`|cTuaFrYiaa	Different people drink different things so don't worry about what anyone is having. I recommend you stay away from straight shots of anything. If you like beer then drink it. If you want to try mixed drinks I suggest Gin & tonic, 7 & 7, are Rum & coke. With the last 2 you can have the alcohol left out if you feel to buzzed. A safe number for most people is 2 drinks an hour.|`|NigoVXX1aa	Beer is the best and have 1 bottle and sip slowly,take your time.If friends say drink fast tell them that you want to enjoy it slowly.|`|IetukCEiaa	Drink about 5 or 6 long island iced teas really fast|`|m5tNp8NBaa	1- I live in brazil, so I can't give my opinion =P here, it's mostly common take beer...<br>  <br>  2- Get a sex on the beach, or a tequila sunrise...they're probably the bests drinks...<br>  <br>  3- Everyone has a different limit...I can drink 6 cups of smirnoff and be normal, without lose reflects or these things...but some friends frinks 2 beers and be drunk -.-
Z4QbQt3Xaa	Yes you cam bake separate layers, each with a different food colour.<br>  You could also colour batches of frosting for between each layer.|`|DfK4JSytaa	Here are two ideas for you to experiment with. Probably the easiest way is to make your vanilla or yellow cake from a mix. Oil and line with parchment paper three 7 inch layer pans. <br>  <br>  Prepare the mix as directed on the package. Then divide evenly into 2 3 bowls. Into the first bowl put a few drops of red coloring and stir so that it a nice shade of pink. Into the third bowl you can 4 squares of melted chocolate and stir thoroughly to mix through. <br>  <br>  Then fill each pan with the mixtures. When they are finished baking, assemble as follows. Put the chocolate layer on the bottom and ice with chocolate icing. Put the vanilla layer on top and ice with vanilla icing. For the top layer, use the pink layer and ice the top and sides with strawberry flavored icing, adding  a few drops of pink food coloring. <br>  <br>  A second way, is to use three mini bread pans, lining the bottoms of each with the oiled parchment paper. Then fill each one as directed above with a separate color. Assemble and ice each one as above. This style looks especially pretty when cut.

Heat oven to 350°. Beat cake mix, water and lemon peel in extra-large glass or metal bowl on low speed 30 seconds; beat on medium speed 1 minute.<br>  <br>  2- Divide batter evenly among 3 bowls. Gently stir 1 food color into each of the batters. Pour red batter into ungreased angel food cake (tube) pan, 10 x 4 inches. (Do not use bundt cake pan or 9 x 3 1/2-inch angel food pan, or batter will overflow.) Spoon yellow batter over red batter. Spoon green batter over top.<br>  <br>  3- Bake 37 to 47 minutes or until top is dark golden brown and cracks feel very dry and not sticky. Do not underbake.

For example if you want 3 layers make three equal sized bowls of mix. then add 2-3 drops of food coloring to each one.

2wdVqIc7aa	I would go for butter because olive oil has a flavor of its own. Might be weird esp. if your making sweet muffins. Just melt the butter and use the same amount that it called for oil. Should be fine.|`|jrBMC3eDaa	hi there!  I'm sure you could go either way!  I live in Greece and have made several sweets that call for olive oil and they always come out great.  have a look here at this website or if you want to use butter just type in the search box "muffins with butter" and see what you get.<br>  Too bad you don't know the muffin man, you could just get your muffins from him! ;-)<br>  happy muffin making!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Do NOT use olive oil- it will give your muffins a funky flavor. Try substituting the same omount of applesauce for the oil. I do that a lot, and it tastes great. Or you can use canned pumpkin (not the pie mix)...this does change the color though, but it adds moisture and lots of nutrients!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I would go with butter. the olive oil may alter the flavor of the cupcakes to much.|`|hT7BhNamaa	J, yes you can, and it will not affect the flavor of the muffin.<br>  <br>  Chris

They are older chicken and are very good roasted!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your meal!

Use the low sodium variety and then mix it with equal parts plain brown, white or wild rice. Still only eat 1 recommended portion from the package.

They can be prepared well in advance, frozen uncooked and then defrosted and baked from the freezer on Christmas Eve or whenever you need them.<br>  <br>   <br>  Makes about 24<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  For the quick flaky pastry: <br>  <br>  6 oz (175 g) butter<br>   <br>  <br>  8 oz (225 g) plain flour<br>   <br>  <br>  pinch salt<br>   <br>  <br>  For the filling: <br>  <br>  1 lb (450 g) good-quality pork sausagemeat<br>   <br>  <br>  1 medium onion, peeled and grated<br>   <br>  <br>  2 level teaspoons chopped fresh sage<br>   <br>  <br>  1 egg, beaten<br>   <br>  <br>  Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 7, 425°F (220°C).<br>  <br>  You will also need 2 baking sheets, lightly greased.<br>  <br>   <br>  The butter needs to be rock-hard from the refrigerator, so weigh out the required amount, wrap it in a piece of foil, then return it to the freezing compartment for 30-45 minutes. Meanwhile sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. When you take the butter out of the freezer, open it up and use some of the foil to hold the end with. Then dip the butter in the flour and grate it on a coarse grater placed in the bowl over the flour. Keep dipping the butter down into the flour to make it easier to grate.<br>  <br>  At the end you will be left with a pile of grated butter in the middle of the flour, so take a palette knife and start to distribute it into the flour (don't use your hands), trying to coat all the pieces of fat with flour until the mixture is crumbly. Next add enough cold water to form a dough that leaves the bowl clean, using your hands to bring it all gently together. Put the dough into a polythene bag and chill it for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.<br>  <br>  When you're ready to make the sausage rolls mix the sausagemeat, onion and sage together in a mixing bowl. Then roll out the pastry on a floured surface to form an oblong (as thin as you can). Cut this oblong into three strips and divide the sausagemeat also into three, making three long rolls the same length as the strips of pastry (if it's sticky sprinkle on some flour).<br>  <br>  Place one roll of sausagemeat on to one strip of pastry. Brush the beaten egg along one edge, then fold the pastry over and seal it as carefully as possible. Lift the whole thing up and turn it so the sealed edge is underneath. Press lightly, and cut into individual rolls each about 2 inches (5 cm) long. Snip three V-shapes in the top of each roll with scissors and brush with beaten egg. Repeat all this with the other portions of meat and pastry.<br>  <br>  If you are going to cook straightaway, place the rolls on baking sheets and bake high in the oven for 20-25 minutes. If you want to cook them later, store them uncooked in a freezer box and freeze until needed. Although you can store the cooked and cooled sausage rolls in an airtight tin, they do lose their crunchiness. For this reason I think it is preferable to remove a few at a time from the freezer and cook them as required<br>  <br>  heres another<br>  Ingredients<br>  375g/13oz bought ready-rolled puff pastry<br>  about 2 tbsp either chutney of your choice, cranberry sauce, mustard, pickle, apple sauce, pesto, sun-dried tomato paste or red onion jam <br>  5 good-quality thick pork sausages <br>  1 small egg, beaten<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Method<br>  1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.<br>  2. Cut the pastry into 10 rectangles, about 7x10cm/2?x4in, and place a small spoonful of your chosen filling into the middle of each one.<br>  3. Cut the sausages in half, making 10 smaller sausages, and then peel away the skins. Lay the sausages on top of the filling on the pastry rectangles. Roll the pastry over the sausage, brushing the join with the beaten egg to seal. Place on a greased baking sheet, sealed-side down, and brush them with the egg to give a nice shiny glaze when cooked.<br>  4. Cook in the oven for 20 minutes until golden and crispy, and eat as soon as they are cool enough or leave to cool completely on a wire rack.<br>  <br>  Tip:<br>  Try experimenting with some of the flavoured sausages available now, and spread the pastry with a complementary filling.

Once it boils, dissolve the cornstarch in one can of evaporated milk, and add to the water, stirring briskly with a wire whisk. Lower the heat to medium and add the second can of milk, the salt, and shortening or butter. Continue to whisk until the sauce thickens. Add the beaten eggs and nutmeg, whisking very quickly (so the eggs don't cook) until well blended. Remove from the heat, stir in the cheese, mix well and set aside, covered, until ready to use. <br>  <br>  Yield: enough for one complete 11 x 14 x 3 pan of moussaka or pastitsio (about 7 cups). <br>  <br>  Storage & Reheating <br>  <br>  Béchamel can be refrigerated for one day (not more). It can be reheated using a double boiler (stirring constantly) or in the microwave, covered, vented, on medium power. Microwave time depends on the amount to be reheated and the microwave's wattage, so check every couple of minutes. <br>  Build the Moussaka from the bottom up: <br>  <br>  PREPARE EGGPLANT <br>  <br>  Wash eggplants and trim off stems. Cut off 1/2-inch wide strips of the skin lengthwise, leaving about an inch in between, all around the eggplant, then cut eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-inch slices. Put slices in a large bowl or on a tray, sprinkle liberally with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes. Rinse well, drain, and pat dry. Brush slices lightly on both sides with olive oil and run them under the broiler on an ungreased cookie sheet until lightly browned and soft. Remove and set aside to cool. <br>  <br>  Note: If you've never fixed this before, there are two reasons often given for salting the eggplant: (1) to remove any bitterness, and (2) to absorb some of the natural liquids.<br>  PREPARE MEAT SAUCE <br>  <br>  Preheat the frying pan or skillet over low heat. <br>  <br>  When the pan is hot, add 2 tablespoons of oil and increase the heat to medium low. Sauté the onions with a wooden spoon, until onions are translucent. Add the meat and continue to sauté until lightly browned. Add tomatoes, 1/2 the breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, garlic, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, allspice, wine, and tomato paste, and mix well. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until all the liquid has been absorbed, about 45 minutes to an hour. <br>  <br>  Note: If there is still liquid in the pan, continue to simmer uncovered, stirring to prevent sticking, until the mixture is as dry as possible. To prevent the final dish from having too much moisture, this step is crucial. <br>  <br>  When dry, remove the cloves, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick (if used), and set sauce aside uncovered until ready to use. <br>  <br>  PREPARE BECHAMEL SAUCE <br>  <br>  While the sauce is simmering, make the béchamel with cheese or 6 cups of basic béchamel, cover, and set aside. <br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). <br>  <br>  BUILD THE MOUSSAKA <br>  <br>  Lightly oil a baking or roasting pan and sprinkle the bottom with the remaining 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. Place a layer of eggplant slices on the breadcrumbs (it's ok to overlap) and spread the meat mixture evenly on top. Cover with the remaining eggplant slices, and carefully pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the top. <br>  <br>  Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 30 minutes, then sprinkle the cheese over the top, and continue to cook for another 15 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. <br>  <br>  Remove the moussaka from the oven and allow to cool for 20-30 minutes. Moussaka is traditionally eaten warm, not hot, and can also be eaten at room temperature. Like many Greek dishes, this is even better the next day. <br>  <br>  Yield: approximately 8 servings <br>  <br>  Serving suggestions:<br>  <br>  Moussaka is traditionally served in very large pieces and it is a heavy dish. Serve with a green salad, crusty bread, and a dry red wine. If anyone has room for dessert, a fruit sorbet or cheese with fruit is a light way to end on a sweet note. <br>  <br>  Notes: <br>  <br>  In Greece, Moussaka is most often made with ground beef.<br>  Moussaka can be prepared up to the béchamel and refrigerated overnight. The next day, add the béchamel sauce and cook. It can also be completely cooked and cooled, then frozen and reheated.|`|snBpZEO3aa	Thyme, bay leaves, oregano, and ground nutmeg with a pinch of cayenne pepper for the cheese sauce make the best moussaka ever! Actually, I've only tried it twice with these spices, but it turned out great each time :)|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Oregano is one of the main herbs used with the addition of leaf parsley which we use in most of our dishes however each cook uses her/his own variations, some even put cinnamon or nutmeg in the meat or sauce.

Of course, I have not seen any of the recipes online as I have my own ideas in food but I wonder if any of them are as we Greeks cook them|`|bspRfskYaa	ground allspice is the one that gives it the real "mousakka" taste, also you always need cinnamon - there are others you can add but as long as you have these it will taste like the mousakka you recognise

5zNwBQZHaa	Hmm - well often "Best recipe" and "diet" do not go together!  But here are some things to try.<br>  <br>  1)  Scramble your eggs with a few teaspoons of water - normally I would say milk or creme, but you mention "diet," :)  <br>  <br>  2)  Personally I add ground pepper to the mixture before cooking - but wait to add salt until they are done.  I find I use less salt that way if it is on top.<br>  <br>  3)  Some things to add to it for seasoning would be any of the Mrs. Dash seasonings.  Personally I like to add a teaspoon of dried dill (for 2 eggs) <br>  <br>  4) I normally do not use teflon, but I do use it for making eggs.  Even so, it helps to put a little something in the pan to keep them from sticking.  For this - even if you are on a diet, I would use a half teaspoon of real butter.  The flavor you get it will be worth the extra calories.<br>  <br>  5) When the eggs are almost done, still a little 'wet' looking, I take the pan off the heat and let it finish cooking with the heat left in the pan.

An apple may have an objective reality to a person with a fatal allergy to apples, but its value to them is negative.  They are not concerned about its reality (which is a given), but its direct effect upon them.<br>  <br>  The value we apply to things is always relative. If somebody discovered a planet made of gold tomorrow, a thousand gold apples may end up being worth less than one real apple.  <br>  <br>  And ... here's the rub ... the value we apply to the apple is more important to us than the fact that it exists!  It turns out that objective reality is actually rather boring, except to the scientists and statisticians among us.

The number one has to meaning until it is given meaning.  Once we give the number meaning, understand it and agree upon it, then we can say that an apple is only one apple, and no more (not 1000), and it is understood.  Everything is objective, but nothing has any particular meaning until you give it some.<br>  <br>  Just think about the people that did not recognize "0" as a number.  If I had an apple and you took it away, what number of apples would I have left?  They may have looked at it as "you have no apples left, but there is no number to qualify that" whereas you or I would say "I have 0 apples left."  Something really only has meaning between people if it is agreed upon and understood.

zsDATxmfaa	well first rinse the rice to keep it clean. then you heat up some oil to fry it once heated put the rice in the pan make sure there is no water though unless u want to get burned. after the rice is golden brown you put tomato bouillon (i think that's what its called) finely chopped in and mix it well. after mixed put in a mixture of liquefied tomato onion garlic and salt and add more water after wards. let it boil. once its boiled for a while put in a can of corn kernels without the juice. let it continue boiling until the water is gone and the rice is nice and fluffy. make sure u don't let it burn though. well that's how i do it i hope it works for u too.

Or Craigslist.|`|m1cEbzBcaa	ebay, or a auction house if they are really valuable, since selling alcoholic beverages in most locations is illegal except when licenced.<br>  <br>  most liquor doesn't age once bottled, so the actual liquid is probably not worth any more than a new one.  I would suggest having a party, empty the bottles, then sell them.|`|39e96e9e3c0bce02422416332ccfeecbaa	well since it's not wine, the liquid hasn't aged since it was bottled.  therefore it really hasn't changed since it was bottled and it's not worth much if anything more than when it was purchased.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	ebay|`|ZJjlcXD4aa	To me....

Cut it in half from top to bottom. Place the halves cut face down. Hold it by the bottom end. Make one horizontal cut halfway across through it, but only as far as the bottom end you are holding. Make parallel vertical cuts down through it, from one side to the other, but only as far as the bottom end you are holding. Then make parallel vertical cuts across through it, from top to bottom, but only as far as the bottom end you are holding. Discard the bottom end. Repeat for the other half, if required.|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	Run the knife frequently under cold water. It works.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	There really is no way to avoid it.
