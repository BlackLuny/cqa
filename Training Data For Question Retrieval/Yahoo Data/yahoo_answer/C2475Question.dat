So I'm looking for some ideas of things I could do to make life a bit more exciting. Only I seem to be running a bit short on imagination right now - the only things I really want to do are beyond my means right now. Any ideas, serious or silly are welcome provided they fit the following criteria:   1 shouldn't cost huge amounts of money - I have very little spare cash.   2 should bear in mind I'm in a long term realtionship (so no snogging random strangers!)   3 should also bear in mind I have a full time job that I'm a bit tied to (see point 1)   Other than that - go wild and inspire me!

20090308002128AA8ckhO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a story/script that i am writing?	This story (which i wrote in a script format, at least for now) is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. There were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was Muramasa and the others name was Masamune. Muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a certain bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. It became somewhat of a rule, that once a muramasa blade is drawn, it cannot be put back into the scabbard unless and until it draws blood, even if it has to be its owners own. Its because of this reason it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. Masamune on the other hand was calm. Tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. His swords were said to rival that of the Muramasa. The legend ended around the late 1500s. I place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by Muramasa. He has killed hundreds. An imperialist samurai named Hayate barely survived. He learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known Masamune blade was kept (since it is said in the legend that the two blades would rival). This is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: For those who don't know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      Priest: There is no reason i should give you this blade      Hayate: If i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      Priest: ...Muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. A battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      Hayate: Stop. I have not come here to listen to your poetry. Each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of Muramasa. I would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, I would simply be cut down. I need it. To protect      Priest: Swords are not made to protect. They are meant to take lives.      Hayate: I am here for the masamune. Weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. But i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. It will be used to take a life. But the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. So i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      Priest: And if i choose to decline?      Hayate: You wont. You have burdened yourself with a duty. Now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      Priest: ...The masamune itself isn't strong enough to take on the muramasa.      Hayate: Then give me more.      Priest: I will make you a daisho, along with the blade of Masamune. Even then however, it still will not mean anything. It will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      Hayate: Then what must i do?      Priest: You must clear your mind. You must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. This sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. If you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. You must be in control..      Hayate: I have let go of the darkness years ago.      Priest: And yet you still have a long way to travel.      Hayate: Then i will travel with the masamune.      Priest: i will see to it...that you do.      Hayate: We dont have time.      Priest: And yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.   --   excerpt 2: It is soon revealed that the person who had Muramasas blade was in fact, a student of a still living Muramasa. The priest was revealed to be Masamune, who saved Hayate from certain death- in the process of sacrificing his own to the hands of Muramasa. Here, Hayate confronts Muramasa:      Muramasa: I have ridiculed you before, but i am not sorry, as i have meant the words i spoke.      Hayate: As have I.      Muramasa: You must understand, in the time that i was...alive...blood shed was the only way of life. It was do or die. It was all i was given, and all was all i was allowed to see. It is all i know.      Hayate: It is all you choose to know. And you let that same Bloodlust keep you alive to this day.      Muramasa: I have yet to find someone worthy enough to kill me.      Hayate: Masamune spoke those same words, as it makes me think that maybe not all of us are very different. In fact, in the frightening reality, many of us are the same.      Muramasa: Stop. This is how it will happen. You will attack. I will defend. You will die.      Hayate: No. it is not. As i speak these words, you are no longer in control or who lives and who dies. And after which these words are spoken, you will no longer decide other peoples fate. You will no longer decide other peoples death. I will decide yours.

I've come up with a couple of theories, but I'm not sure if i missed something.      Maybe, as dumbledore contended, as the wand wasn't made by "death himself", the wand wasnt actually unbeatable but rather more powerful.  therefore, as dumbledore was "a shade" more talented, he managed to pull off a victory.      maybe, also, Grindelwald was remorseful and let him win.      i dunno if either are plausible, tell me what you think

20090308030107AAyQqVR	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	The mind is the matrix of all matter?	A quote by the famous physicist Max Planck:      "As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: There is no matter as such. All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the matrix of all matter."      I was just curious, was he referring literally to the idea that all matter has a conscious mind in one form or another? or was he just trying to be clever?      Is it actually possible for matter to be "intelligent"?

20090308002613AA6qWee	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you think of this story?	Eragon and Saphira had finally met Galbatorix in battle, but he proved to be far superior. At first, they had fought their old friend, Murtagh, who had been enslaved by the king Galbatorix. Eragon had had to kill him. Instead of getting much needed rest, Eragon and his dragon faced the evil king and his black dragon, Shriukan, in a fight to determine the fate of Alagaesia.      The battle shook the earth underneath of them. Until, at last, Galbatorix sliced through Eragon's ribs. Orik, Roran, and Arya had watched from a far, but, when their friend had fallen before them, the three of them charged against the king. They were easily knocked out by his magic.      When Eragon and the others woke up, a man in white robes that seemed to glow with power was standing over them. "My my, you seem to have had quite the fight. You were lucky that I saved you when I did," said the old man.      "Who are you?" asked Eragon.      "My name you will know in time."      "Is Galbatorix dead?"      "My you're full of questions aren't you. No he is not. I merely summoned you to me. He should come looking for you shortly. He knows where you are. He sensed my magic when you were whisked away from him." The old man sat in a seat of wood that rivaled the craftsmanship of Ellesmera, but something differed in the way that it was made.      "Where are we?" asked Arya.      "You too?" The old man sighed. "You are in Rivendell, House of Elrond. You are not in the land of Alageasia that you fell in, but in the land of Middle-Earth." At that moment a golden-haired male elf came in and said that they were ready.      The old man picked up a walking stick made of a wood that no one in Eragon's company knew the name of. He led them into a courtyard where another man, the elf, a dwarf, and Saphira waited. The old man began to speak to both of the groups.      "The final stage of the war against Sauron has begun. He was able to capture Frodo and Sam. He has the One Ring and has returned to his physical form. I have taken these young warriors from their own land in order to help us. We also will be helping them be rid of their own Dark Lord."      "Dark Lord?" interrupted Eragon. The other group looked at him amused. Eragon's face turned red. "I know we have an evil king, but ...." He trailed off when he realized what they were talking about. Then the old man resumed.      "We will soon be faced with a second evil. So for this we must prepare. I will need to see what each of your capabilities are. I hope no one opposes to a training bout."      No one did.      "Dwarf Orik meet Gimli, son of Gloin." Orik stood to face the other of his kind. They raised their axes ready to begin.      "Elf Arya you will spare against Legolas, prince of Mirkwood." The male elf stepped forward and drew a pair of thin blades. Arya touched her lips and spoke the greeting of her kind. Legolas nodded. Confused about why a kinsmen did not answer, Arya drew her sword.      "Roran Stronghammer you will fight Aragorn, son of Arathorn and King of the realm of Gondor." Roran bowed before the lord of men. Roran pulled his hammer from his belt, and Aragorn drew Anduril, Flame of the West.      "And Eragon Shadeslayer I will be you're opponent. I am Gandalf the White strongest of the five wizards."      "There are plenty of wizards where I come from why are there only five here?"      "Well there are, but they do not call themselves wizards and the spell casters here are different from the ones you have faced. A fore warning, do not attack an enemies mind here." The old wizard stared at Eragon for a few seconds then said, "Begin!" At once, the two rival groups attacked.            Orik will only fight Gimli      Arya will only fight Legolas      Roran will only fight Aragorn      Eragon will only fight Gandalf      All are at the levels they were at the end of their trilogies.

20090227132523AAKKXuQ	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Which one do you think is better?	This theme week in photography is circles. Any kind of circle. My original plan was to go with  http://drenton.deviantart.com/art/Sir-Ki...  , because it combines a a circle and a portrait, but the circle isn't that dominant.   So this morning, I dressed up and had a little photo shoot. The end result was this:  http://drenton.deviantart.com/art/Pickin...  .      In the event that anyone suggest a change that I think would work well with the picture, I'll edit the version up on my Deviant Art.

I on the other hand think before I act and while deep in thought, I often find a reason not to take action.        Is motivation innate?  Can anyone who wants to become motivated do so?  I've tried to become motivated but it never seems to work out in the long term.

20081009173810AAYL2yO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Would you please tell me what you think of my poem?	She cries alone at night,   Tells herself it will be alright.      Bears each scar on her own,   Accepts each blow all alone.      Every tear burning inside,   Weak with the strength it takes to hide.      But still she sits alone,   burying everything deep down.      Tired eyes see only darkness,   Each day she feels like less.      Why does she let herself burn?   Allow herself to be so torn?      She didn't deserve an ounce of the pain,   To only be able to see the rain.      She's just a girl behind the eyes,   No superhero in disguise.      Dying slowly deep inside,   Praying for everything to be alright.      Only so much that she can bear,   When no one else is there.      She's just a girl.         thanks =) advice and criticism would be awesome, but please don't be mean. i spent a long time working on this.

I know people from darker skin live in Africa and that could be one of the reasons.   But,  when people see someone who is "black" they say they are African American. How do you know that they aren't from France or somewhere else. Everyone who is "black" automatically  said to be from Africa, no questions asked. There are many "black" people who live in different parts of the world like England and such. So how do you know if your not English rather than African?   I just want to know why because I am trying to learn more about my heritage and stuff like that.

20090227133323AATiMbC	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Analyze meaning of this Christian Symbol?	This symbol appears on a stained glass window on a Franciscan Catholic Church in New Jersey... not sure what it means.      My best guess is that it is a combination of the Franciscan tau cross, three nails as the literal nails used to crucify Jesus, or as a symbol of the trinity, and a circle, which could be representative of the crown of thorns or the typical circle image of religious institution implying eternity. Anybody have more insight to offer? The actual origin of the image would be awesome.

Come, you spirits    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full    Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,    That no compunctious visitings of nature    Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between    The effect and it!

20090308004240AAuW1gh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this poem really short but is it till good?	Apocalypse       The sun was beaming, the  earth revolved around it,   The flowers swayed in the cool spring breeze,   The sky was like a portrait, painted by the Gods,   The sea was a flawless dark blue that sparkled like diamonds.      All was well as a couple viewed the world,    The high-rise buildings that dominated the sky,   The green trees that brought life to the world,    The birds glided like planes that soared high.       The sun retreated in a hurry, the earth stood still,   The flowers were no longer swaying,    The earth’s duties, it could no longer fill.    The sea turned rough, our world is decaying.       The couple stood their ground and waited for the worst,   As the rain, wind and thunder attempted to break them down.   The earth trembled beneath their feet,    But the couple still stood strong – waiting for their time to come.      A great big ball of fire plummeted from the heavens,   As the final role call came, the Apocalypse.   For a moment, all was silent, all went dark,   As the lovers grasped each others hands,    Waiting to go to the promise land.
20090308001656AATAqrE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What does it take to be a good writer?	Writing has been something that's always been at the back of my mind. I find intrinsic enjoyment out of writing my own thoughts and opinions. But, for the last 8 years of my life, I haven't even considered pursuing it as a career. I'm a psych major, and about to graduate, but my skills and personality are not congruent with the careers available. So I've been considering a career in writing (relating to my science background - technical or science journalism).       Despite not coming from a literature or English background, I've been told that I'm a good writer from my older sis and my grade 8 teacher (I won an essay contest back then). But that's clearly not enough proof. I haven't written anything but research proposals and research essays since high school so I have no idea how capable of a writer I am. What does it take? How do I know I'm a good writer? How do I become a good writer?       I doubt myself because I've always believed that writing is an inherent ability. Something that you're born with. Am I mistaken? Can it be mastered with practice?

20090308014350AAJwhcM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I read this book a while ago and cant remember what its called, help?	Well, in the beginning of the book a girl's bike got run over by a van, then all of a sudden they gave her a brand new one, she started spending more time with the lady who gave her the new bike. She asked her to come stay with her for the summer and she went, there was a big lake and a boat and horses and the house was huge and the lady started calling the girl by the name of her daughter who moved away a while ago, she learned to sail all summer, she gave the girl dresses to wear and they had a big barbeque and then she finds a photo of the Lady's daughter and he looks exactly like her! after a little while she started realizing that the big gates outside the house were locked and the lady was making her stay in and not letting her out much. and then she tries to escape one night and swims across the lake and the lady follows her and ends up drowning. i think the lady was called something like mrs Conty or something but i cant remember i REALLY want to read this book again does anyone know what it's called?
