GduRpnn0aa	How old is your kitten? You should take any kitten to the vet as soon as you bring them home, in order to do a health check on them and make sure that they are healthy.    However, your kitten could either have an allergy to something in your house or she could have developed an upper respiratory infection.     Many cats  especially very young and older cats  are prone to catching upper respiratory infections, similar to colds in humans. These tend to be highly contagious, so its best to keep an infected cat away from others (if possible).    Respiratory infections can be hard on kittens and elderly cats, occasionally resulting in death. And even for otherwise healthy and strong cats, respiratory infections are very unpleasant  just as a cold or flu is unpleasant to you. So its a good idea to get treatment, if only to ease your cats symptoms.    Its quite easy to tell when your cat is suffering from an upper-respiratory infection. Look for these symptoms:    Sneezing   Runny nose   Watery eyes   "Rattling" breath, husky purring   Snoring   Reduced energy levels     For an upper respiratory infection, you could buy Respiratory Aid. It is a herbal supplement that fights the infection and symptoms, whilst also opening up your cats airways therefore allowing easier breathing. It also builds up your cats natural defenses and helps to prevent the spread of infection to other cats as well as preventing reoccurrence of the infection.     Here is the link: http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-cough-p7...    However, if it is an allergy attack then you should rather give your cat Stimmune as it a herbal formulation that helps to alleviate cat allergies by maintaining natural balance within the body and by stimulating the immune system. It can also be used to treat recurrent infections and fatigue.    Here is the link: http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-allergie...    Allergies are the most common illnesses affecting cats. They are caused by changed lifestyles, including food and environment. Cat allergies are characterized by the body's abnormal reaction to internal or external stimuli and are caused by many different factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one cat to another, even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in the cats own body, causing the body to react against itself such as in auto-immune diseases. It is important to try to find the cause for cat allergies, even though it can be difficult. Along with working towards finding the cause, the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to strengthen the immune system.    Common Symptoms of Cat Allergies:    Skin problems (the most common evidence of allergic reaction)   Eruptions, redness and itchiness of the skin and swelling of the affected area   Digestive problems (such as diarrhea and gas)|`|L75kWYehaa	Could be cat flu - get your kitten checked - better safe than sorry as they are so tiny they have very little immunity and can deteriorate rapidly.|`|qKmseKhOaa	i  would  be takeing  her to  the vet  just  to make sure she's  ok|`|eDEcGXcnaa	yes because she could die then u would be depressed and say "theres nothing to live for" Then you would reject all your friends as u say to yourself why would i let a poor innocent cat die because i was to stupid to do anything!!!!! thats wat could happen lol|`|bj1fT8ctaa	It's a good idea to take any new pet to the vet for a checkup.  I'm not sure if she's sick or just adjusting, but it's probably a good idea to get her checked.|`|PaAMtluGaa	I would take her to the vets but i heard that this can also be caused by stress. Im not too sure if its true but its better to be safe than sorry  Hope shes okay :)|`|Rv1GvhQUaa	i wouldn't worry too much unless it continues|`|eB7mTlaCaa	My cat had the same symptoms when I first brought here home.  She started out crying, then went to sneezing and coughing.  I took her to the vet and they gave her an antibiotic, clovomax, not sure of the spelling, that was liquid form.  The vet said alot of cats have diseases that are dormant but become active if the cat becomes stressed.      Definately take your kitty! I hope she feels better :)|`|jDuSXZETaa	hi,yeah make an appointment asap as she could have cat flu which is a killer if not caught in time.it may be nothing but i would get it checked out.does she have gunky eyes or anything?if cat flu is caught on time it is treatable but you can never totally cure it.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	keep her warm and take her to the vet, just to make sure.|`|yqwSCLLbaa	take him/her to the vet tell the vet what you told us and see what he says and then buy him like those climbing trees:  http://www.cozycatfurniture.com/images/c...   from a pet-store make a corner for your kitten buy him cute toys and he'll get used to it but make sure to get his shots may be that's why he is sneezing i dunno do what you can do i hope your kitten feels better !! |`|UF5ZwzHCaa	Even if she wasn't sneezing, I would take her to a vet to get checked out.  SHe could have gotten something from another cat.|`|zeTGmB3faa	She does miss her litter mates and the comfort and warmth they provide. That is one issue. If she is sneezing and coughing it is likely that she has an upper respiratory infection and needs to see a vet. Kittens need to be seen quickly as their immune systems are delicate and cannot fight off many diseases. After the vet gives you the meds, most likely she needs antibiotics, start her on her yearly vaccinations.
3ybVdfMEaa	Bettas are solitary fish. They do not get lonely, and they do not need tankmates.    However, *most* bettas will tolerate tankmates so long as the tank is large enough and the species compatible. But a 1 gallon tank is NOT large enough. Frankly, I think it's too small for even a single betta; you should have at least 2.5 gallons. For a betta and an African dwarf frog, I'd recommend at least 5 gallons.      If you add a frog to the 1 gallon tank, it'll probably die. The fish waste builds up too quickly in that small of a volume. Plus, there's no place for a frog to escape to if the betta becomes aggressive. And the betta's more likely to be aggressive in that small environment.|`|AA11708471	Bettas need 5 gallons heated and filtered minimum if you want to add an african dwarf frog you need 7 gallons minimum    Bettas are happy by themselves but are fine with most other aquatic animals including some fish|`|ivg0lRUraa	Not a very good idea in a 1 gallon tank. Betas can be territorial.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Too small a tank, hes not gonna care either way. Plus dwarf frogs need heaters as they come from Africa and are tropical.  Spend some money and upgrade your existing tank before you spend money on more fish. Good Luck|`|cXK9sY1raa	Bettas don't need company, he's not lonely at all. He'd probably be annoyed at the intruder.    If you want to keep frogs, set up a new tank.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	In short, no.  The most likely outcome is that the frog will eat the betta.    Besides, a 1-gallon tank is too small for even a dwarf frog.    By the way, it's spelled betta, not beta (so you can look up more information on your fish).|`|aBhW9YVXaa	no.. i wouldn't...in such a small tank, the betta will get VERY territorial, and probably attempt to kill it...|`|QPPcUyyyaa	The only way to know it to try it.  Go for it!|`|39pl2Dotaa	well i got my beta a baby snail and my beta ate it|`|OsVswissaa	Bettas don't want company but they will often tolerate it.  Some bettas are more territorial than others.  If you get a frog, be ready with a plan B in case it doesn't work out.    A one gallon tank needs 100% water changes as you know, it might be too stressful for the frog.|`|TYohMrlXaa	While people have had luck keeping these species together, don't think that your betta needs or wants company. They are very territorial and prefer to remain along. In any case one gallon is not enough for both the betta and the frog. If you really want to try this you will need a bigger tank. I wouldn't recommend any less that 5 gallons so they will have some space to stay away from each other, and a heater to reduce stress.|`|Gta9wO3taa	Those frogs dont eat fish food (bloodworms instead) and you need a 10 gallon for just one.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	try it can you add me as a friend i wanna know what happens please xxx ty xx|`|TSQxwlbraa	No, I wouldn't. Better to be safe then sorry, right?|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	Betta's don't like tank mates|`|bj1fT8ctaa	Bettas don't like company.  He's likely to attack the frog; it's not a good idea.  It's better to have separate tanks for both (or they sell betta bowls with a divider in the middle, so you could keep the betta on one half and the frog on the other).|`|I9apDK03aa	not in a 1gallon tank
PM23RDycaa	BSL for the persuasive. I think raw feeding is great but its not for everyone and as long as they aren't feeding crap in a bag its fine by me(central idea). BSLs on the other hand are becoming more prevalent and need to be dealt with.    Up here in Maine where I am its actually a law that now new laws can be drafted in regards to dogs that target any specific breed or group of breeds, so there are plenty of APBTS, staffies and mixes being walked around. ALL of thm are sweet as pie. We do have strict laws as far as bites and attack go, this should be true of every state and they need to focus on punishing the owners of problem animals and not just broad stroke paint the breed.    BSLs make law abiding pet owners with well trained and socialized animals into criminals.    ADD: Links    http://stopbsl.com/    http://www.understand-a-bull.com/    http://www.rott-n-chatter.com/rottweiler...    http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelt...    http://www.saynotobsl.org.uk/index.php?o...    http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus7...|`|AA10229248	I've done speeches on BSL and have found it to be very well recieved and hotly discussed. There are several bully breed forums out there where you can get lots of first hand accounts from bully breed owners. Here are a couple of other helpful sites:    www.pbrc.net  http://thetruthaboutpitbulls.com|`|F27az9NEaa	I do many speeches on BSL & bully breeds and recently did a 10 page research paper on BSL. I think it would be a great topic for the persuasive; I know little about raw-feeding.  I'd love to be of assistance if you need any help!    I think I have a few links to databases that have information for and against BSL so you can see both sides of the story.  Good Luck|`|P8Q39vA4aa	For your central it should be raw feeding   and your persuasive should be BSL    if they dont know what it is its a perfect time to educate.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	I would have loved to have done a BSL debate back in school!  I think it's a great educational topic, as there are many dog breeds that could eventually be effected by BSL laws if we don't continue to fight them...I use this site often:    http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/...  as well as the 75 Dangerous Dog list...|`|d97e0d7c192c0cd5634d474777b47535aa	I would use raw feeding as the central idea and anti-BSL as therre persuasive. The are many pages out there for anti-BSL but the best way to research it would be to study BSL. A good place to use as an example is Denver. They have the worst BSL, they literally go around taking dogs without notice, hold people at gunpoint to take them and kill the dogs - so far the tally is over 2000. There is a site (dogsbite.org) that actually keep a tally of how many pitbulls are killed, it's like a game to them or something. I'm on  http://www.pitbull-chat.com/ it's a very good site. You can ask people about these topics or just read. They're all very smart and you don't have to deal with the horrible stereotyping, name calling and nazi like ideas of a lot of the pro-BSL sites. They will also be able to help you with the raw feeding portion.    You should also look up the dog temperament stats, it would help your speech a lot (bully gods are actually ranked highest) and get the true bite stats, not the numbers people like to make up.
AE7W7Jspaa	Barns are always looking for manual labor, its hard work and doesn't pay a whole lot, the hours are lousy, but if you love horses and dont mind the work its a great place to start.

You know your dog better than anyone, you can judge her quality of life. If I were you I'd be guided by my vet,ask them how much the treatments are affecting her and is she in pain. You will know when the time is right to let her go, look in her eyes.    Just read some of the other responses,cant believe how people can be so arrogant to pre-judge a person on why their dog isnt speyed.

I would assume she is on the NSAID for arthritis pain. So, it is kind of a double edged sword. You don't want her to be in pain, but you also don't want to destroy her liver and kidneys. She is an elderly dog, so it would be best to address your vet with these concerns. If you don't feel that your vet is giving you adequate information, then seek a second opinion. Unfortunately with progressed mammary tumors (aka breast cancer) and CHF, she may be winding down in her long life. You seem to have done a lot for her thus far. I hope you can come to terms with everything. Good luck.|`|9fo0WANhaa	Your dog is a medical miracle!     Spend lots of time with her and maybe light a fire and let her sleep near it. Buy her some toys and some dog jerky.     best of luck!
gM7VuCM4aa	It is not bad to have a kitty when you are pregnant. Not everyone gives up their cat because they are pregnant. It is the changing of litter boxes when pregnant that can be bad. This is because of something called toxoplasmosis.    Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii.[1] The parasite infects most genera of warm-blooded animals, including humans, but the primary host is the felid (cat) family. Animals are infected by eating infected meat, by ingestion of faeces of a cat that has itself recently been infected, or by transmission from mother to fetus. Cats have been shown as a major reservoir of this infection.[2]    Up to one third of the world's population is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection.[3] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that overall seroprevalence in the United States as determined with specimens collected by the National Health and Nutritional Assessment Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2004 was found to be 10.8%, with seroprevalence among women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years) of 11%.[4]    During the first few weeks, the infection typically causes a mild flu-like illness or no illness. After the first few weeks of infection have passed, the parasite rarely causes any symptoms in otherwise healthy adults. However, people with a weakened immune system, such as those infected with HIV or pregnant, may become seriously ill, and it can occasionally be fatal. The parasite can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and neurologic diseases and can affect the heart, liver, and eyes (chorioretinitis).    Just don't go near or change the litter box and you and your baby will be fine. Good Luck!|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	It's not the cat it's self. Its the type of litter you may use for you car. I would suggest a less dusty litter, a litter box with a cover on it, and it have a filter. Also you should not be the one cleaning the litter box. It's just the same as house cleaning, or painting, or any of those things. The chemicals are what's bad for you, not the animal.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	I've heard this!  I couldn't believe it.  I'm not sure how much truth there is to it.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	its not the cat its there litter|`|AA10229248	Pregnant women should not scoop the litter box because they can run the risk of contracting Toxoplasmosis from cat feces. As long as someone else scoops the box, you shouldn't have any problems.     Contrary to old wive's tales, cats do not steal a baby's breath or anything like that. A cat will shed hair all over the place and it can get on bottles and pacifiers and stuff like that. Also, some cats are afraid of babies and freak out when a new baby is brought into the house.    But if you're all comitted to working together, there is no reason why it shouldn't work out. Intelligent people don't dump their cats just because they're pregnant. There are a lot of idiots out there who do use it as an excuse to get rid of the cat, though.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	The concern is likely contracting toxoplasmosis.  It actually is not a high risk.  Just use common sense when changing the cat litter.  If common sense hygiene precautions are used, things should be all right.  Even better is to have someone else do it for the pregnant person.    I sometimes think the tripping risk is one of the highest risks of having a pet, as they sometimes like to walk between your legs while you are walking.|`|QikvnTnqaa	What's bad is the litterbox, not the cat. All you really have to do is have someone else clean the litterbox and keep an air freshener in whatever room it's in.  :) And congrats!!!|`|mRevWUxlaa	Cats' feces are the dangerous part. If you come in contact with feces from the cat, which can be transferred from the cats paws, all over the house, you can contract Toxoplasmosis. That can be deadly to your baby. It can cause still birth, blindness, or the baby could be born with life threatening illnesses.|`|M3GDjEHtaa	Well i highly doubt the cat's going to try to kill your baby but they are very jealous creatures. As long as you keep yourself from cleaning the litter box, keep it from being around the babies stuff (lying on it's blankets, hoping into it's cradle, trying to rub against the baby bottles), I think you should be good. It's all common sense really.|`|19L99wvCaa	Do not change the litter box. Cat feces carries a germ (I don't recall what it is) that can harm the embryo/fetus. Changing the box stirs it up and makes it airborne, during which you could then breathe in the germ. Make sure you are not in the same room when anyone else changes it. You should be okay as long as you follow those guidelines. I kept my kitty during my pregnancy by wearing a mask and rubber gloves when I changed her litter.    Congratulations!|`|435c271Kaa	You should avoid emptying the litter box because inhaling the ammonia from the urine is dangerous for your baby. Once the baby is born, keep the cat away while the infant is sleeping because they can suck the breath from the baby. This means that the cat will lie on the sleeping infant, and the combination of the cats weight, and the cat purring or just breating close to the childs face  will make it difficult or impossible for the child to breathe or move the animal. Another thing is cat scratches can cause bacteria in the wound because they bury their business in litter and carry the germs on them.
3p6wp7DYaa	Are you following recipes from a reputable and trustworthy source? If so, the same book should have very strict guidelines about portion sizes. Do not start cooking your own dog food unless you are following specific advice from a book written by a veterinarian or nutritionist. You will most likely have to supplement this food with certain minerals and vitamins, and you also need to watch out for what percentage of calories comes from what food groups. Double check the book you got the recipes from, and just convert the ratios given to a per pound basis, then multiply by your dog's weight. For example, if the book says you should feed 12 ounces per 15 pounds of body weight per day, what that means is 0.8 ounces per pound, and your 55lb dog should be eating around 44 ounces. Of course that is simply a hypothetical example, and you also have to adjust to activity level and any health conditions your dog might have.|`|PM23RDycaa	I stared this for my BARF feeder contacts. I prefer raw feeding prey model and franken prey (no fruits and veggies)    Your dog will also need organ meats and raw meaty bones.    ADD: 1.1 pounds (17.6 ounces) per day total or 0.55 pounds (9 ounces) for one meal for 55lbs dog at 2% of her current weight. You may have to tweak this amount based on how her weight handles.

If he likes it, GREAT! if not, then maybe you should stop making it.|`|VLzXypQ4aa	Okay.. as far as how much to serve them. I would look at canned food and take it from there. Its also not good to only feed animals wet food.. its very important for them to have dry food as well. Reason being .... they have teeth and they can decay anr rot from only eating wet food. I would be very careful with having them eat wet foods only. You want to check with your vet about changing your dogs diet, Its costly if you have to get teeth extracted and infections can occur in the mouth if they are hacing dental problems. I would actually recommend you to go to the vet before you start their homemade food. Justto be safe!! ;)|`|TjsR0nc4aa	I could probably eat about 16 ounces.  I'm not sure if it is a good idea to mix in fruits, veggies, and other types of meats with your dog though.  Dog on its own should suffice.  A little worcestershire, salt, pepper, smoke flavor, soy sauce, and one bay leaf should do the trick.  It is even tastier the slower you cook it.    Regarding your 55 lb shepherd/chow mix, you should probably invite people over, since I highly doubt you will be able to finish all that by yourself.  Good luck.

The stripes were digitally airbrushed. <br>  <br>  And that third picture is of an african wild dog. They are completely wild and should stay that way. <br>  <br>  There are dogs that come in brindle and some can look like tiger stripes but not exactly.|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	It's probably "brindle" that you're thinking of.

7fVr3q0kaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your kitty's decline.<br>  <br>  I haven't experienced the loss of a cat yet, but when I do, I know it will be very, very hard.<br>  <br>  I have an acquaintence who recently went through a similar situation with her aged kitty, and he did eventually die. She said that cats let you know when it's time to put them down. Some signs are that they stop grooming, stop eating, drinking, and taking an interest (even a feeble interest) in the things they used to.<br>  <br>  I'm no expert on this, but I hope that helps. I would encourage you to trust your relationship with your beloved kitty, and go with your gut on what she's communicating to you about her readiness to go.<br>  <br>  Also, keep communicating with her vet. The vet will be able to give you valuable information about the kitty's pain level, etc., that you might have no other way of knowing.<br>  <br>  -KittyMamma<br>  <a href="http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://KittyMamma.blogspot.com</a>|`|utOVoGo3aa	Well, did you talk to your vet about the problem? if not them maybe you should because maybe there are other medications that you can give your cat to make her feel better. If there is no way to help her then sadly, yes, you might want to put her to sleep. You might feel bad about it but she will thank you because she is in pain. I know its heart breaking but shes old and maybe its her time, she seems like a good cat. Maybe you can get a new cat so you can feel better, it helped me when my cat died. Hope this helped, Good luck.|`|b3FkhOicaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your cat.  I used to have two cats, and one of them was abused as a kitten.  They were best friends, and although the abused one wouldn't let us very near him, we still loved him.  Then, one day, we found him lying in a corner.  The vert said he died from a heart problem that we hadn't known about before.  My entire family was so sad, because we could never get very close to him.  But the saddest thing was his playmate all alone.  His playmate gained weight and started not exercising or playing anymore.  We got a kitten from a shelter this summer, but our old cat hates the new kitten.  It's heartbreaking to see them fight and remember how our two cats were best friends before.  <br>     The only advice I can give you is to know you are doing the right thing by putting her out of her misery.  You are helping her.  Yes, it will be very sad to let go, but it has to happen and you will be okay in the end.  Also, what really helped me is to get a kitten.  They are lively, exciting, and energetic, and it helps distract you.  Also, you can pet them when you are sad and just want to cry alone.  I'm sorry you have to go through this, but I hope it all works out.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	It is very hardbreaking but your cat will be much happier. Just know she is feeling a lot of pain and would want you to do this.  She will not suffer anymore and the pain will be all gone. She knows you lover her and didnt want to let her go, but she will be happy if you do, because there will be no more pain to suffer from, like she is having right now.
CdRlOsnyaa	try ebay or kijiji or craiglist, they have big aquariums for cheap. but aqauriumshop.com from what i heard is a reputable company, a friend of mine bought a tank from there and it worked for him so im guessing it will for you.good luck to you and your geckos.
1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You don't know that it isn't broken until you've had x-rays.  Your dog could very well have a fracture and need to be in a splint/cast.  Take her to the Vet and don't let your "friend" near her.<br>  If you haven't got the money for Vet care then you haven't got the money to own a dog!<br>  You need to call the police and report your roommate.|`|GaL66jbQaa	It might be a cruciate ligament tear.  keep her crated except to go out so she can't use it until you can have her seen.  how are you going to feed your dog?  Perhaps you should give her to a family that has the financial means to give her the care she deserves while you get back on your feet.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Don't let her run around too much. Keep activity light. She may have joint injury torn ligament, or tissue swelling. If it isn't broken it should heal on it's own.(medicine from the vet could speed healing. Maybe your friend would like to help?)|`|AA10265922	just give it some time to heal,it may take a while but hopefully it will heal okay,i know about the vets,they cost as much as our doctor's,i think the 'baby' will be ok,just give it lots of love|`|nd30LQhlaa	just let her rest...I have a chi and their VERY dramatic...lol...but shes should be fine...and please if people get on here and "yell" at you for not having the money for a vet.Dont listien to them! Your just fine!!!<br>  So anyways your chi should be fine if she doesnt get better within a week or so then maybe you can take her to a shelter cause sometimes they have vets who will look at her for cheap..Good luck dear!|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Well, judging from this question and your other question, you should give your dog to the humane society as you seem to be unable and unwilling to properly care for it.  If you can't afford the dog, give it to someone who can.  You are despicable for letting your "friend" abuse your dog and doing nothing about it.  Your dog could have a broken bone.  If a bone fragment gets caught in the dog's blood stream, they could die.  It would be a horribly painful death too.   How irresponsible!  SHAME ON YOU!!!|`|rIQXNxn5aa	Don't listen to the people who say once your dog is taken care of get rid of it!  Seriously, that is sooo mean and rude. Not all people bath in money. But ask some family or close friends to borrow some money.  We have enough money for m dog, but sometimes, we are low on money and can't take her to a vet on the drop of a dime. But try and borrow money and get the dog to a vet.|`|BI4GNyuJaa	You should call a vet. You don't have to make an appointment, just call them and ask for advice. If they don't give you advice and insist on an appointment that you can't afford, then you should rest your dog's leg. Which means, no walks. Just let her rest and try to keep her calm. If it gets worse or starts swelling, ask for someone to lend you money that you can pay off, because it might be serious.|`|XNxFBrbAaa	thats why you should be financially set when getting a dog..little things like this can happen a lot...and you need to be prepared for it...wether its a  serious matter or not<br>  <br>  lacie c-yeah thats it..lets tell every person who gets a dog and has no money to take care of it that its OKAY...its okay they cant afford to take there dog to the vet..theres a good idea.....did u get my sarcasm?|`|0diOaNoxaa	Just a reminder....if you have no $ for food, you can get food stamps. They'll give them to you in 3 days if it's an emergency. And I think you may be able to buy dog food with them if it's at the grocery store ? ( not sure about that )<br>  <br>  Good Luck with pooch.|`|LtxNbyGQaa	give it to your family to  help you they might pay for the vet|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well, sorry that your funds are not available but, your dog can have a fracture that may heal wrong, your dog could have pulled tendons and needs it rested,  we have no way to know but whatever it is, it isn't good that she is hurting so I suggest you sell something or ask family and friends and tell them when you may be able to start a re-payment plan. I am sure you would like to know if there is damage what can be done and if not well then you and her are just lucky! For the future may I suggest that you start a doggy jar, put your loose change and a few ones in it..I know how tight money can be but as a pet owner we need to remember that they may not always be healthy and need some assistance from a vet.Also I would like to suggest maybe you have a local shelter that has vet care ours does at a lower cost.I hope your dog is okay soon.|`|ElbK2HRBaa	good lord get some help ask somebody if you can borrow money and that you will pay it back or give it to the animal shelter obviously you do not have enough money to look after your own dog, ask a vet for some advice for now i guess but you foolish to think you can take of your dog when you can not take the dog to the vet?!!|`|7OHbWOjaaa	I've had several chihuahuas over my lifetime and they all at some point or another started doing this. Some started younger than the others. At first we were really worried but it never seemed to be a problem for them, they just got bored and quit using it. maybe arthritis or something? Anyway, don't be alarmed it seems like a breed thing.|`|0tlkSKScaa	All you can really do is wait, it's probably just bruised. If the problems don't stop, when you do have the money you need to take her to the vet though girly.|`|07c52efaf0cf0b14367ed214c9c89298aa	She might have torn her ACL, which they just do 6 weeks of crate rest and leash walk, my dog just did this too. I'd say as little walking for her as possible and no jumping. It cold also be luxating patellas|`|3hmQYGnGaa	It's probably just sore or twisted. Wait a few weeks and see if she gets better.|`|xQeolc88aa	Here and now - don't let your dog jump and run around|`|mtoUep7Iaa	take her to the vet|`|AJxl0IvHaa	Now... why would a dog have a splinter when some one DROPPED a dog with SMALL legs?<br>  If you care for her.... get her to a vet! Thats sad!<br>  Ask to borrow money from someone.Sell some junk you dont need...<br>  You cant do much  yourself.<br>  Go put your dog up for adoption after this is fixed!!!!|`|JDxpjT34aa	Since you dog is letting you touch her leg and paws and is walking on it some of the time is sounds like it might be a sprain. If it was broken or something serious your dog probably wouldn't be okay with you touching it. If it's only sore when she overuses it but it's not sore all the time it's probably something that will heal on its own, just try not to let her run or be too rough on her leg in the meantime. If it doesn't get better in the next few weeks then you may have something to worry about.
KqqfswH8aa	Yes it is possible and he will be very okay. You should probably take him to a vet to get him checked out just to make sure it is nothing to serious. But good luck, don't stress over it things will be okay.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	He should be taken to the vet. He may have an upper respiratory infection, sinus infection or other problems that may only be treated with anti biotics.|`|YAcwm37Laa	My cat had that to it matters how old it is<br>  if it just stop feeding from its mother and u fed it 1% milk that might happen|`|ZotbP52paa	You should take him to the vet if it doesn't clear up in a few days. It'll more than likely be OK.|`|aROSez8Eaa	Once my cat had a really bad sore throat. It was actually pretty funny to hear him meow... I would take him (your cat) to the vet to get some antibiotics.|`|aAXCyeoBaa	You should take it to the vet they can get Cat Flu which can kill if it gets bad. Symptoms are runny nose and discharge from the eyes.|`|Tcyn0Tzaaa	Its probably is just a little cold , but if he get really sick you should take it to the vet.|`|icaatrmhaa	Yes it is possible, but don't worry. Take him to the vet and they'll <br>  give him some medicine. He should be better very soon.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes!|`|b3FkhOicaa	Take him to the vet to get medication.  My cat had a cold, and after a few days with a medicine, she was perfectly fine!
qqUvoC5uaa	Can you find anyone to take care of her for that amount of time?<br>  She should technically be fine but going from 2 hours to 9 without peeing may come as an unwelcomed shock to her. <br>  Do you know anyone up by your daughter's place that could maybe look after her?<br>  Maybe check into a kennel or something, I'm sure they'd understand. Or maybe a doggy daycare.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	7 months old, depending on breed...I'd say 4 hours max.  That's if you take her out right before you leave and immediately after getting home.  If she's a small breed, maybe 3 hours or less.<br>  <br>  You could always bring her to the vet or a local kennel.  They will board her for a half day for you. She'll go out regularly, they'll pay attention to her and you'll be able to spend a worry free time at your daughters wedding. :)  Have them board her overnight if you don't think you can pick her up the same day.  SHe'll be fine!|`|AA10265922	do you have a puppy 'palor' in your town,they will keep him or her for you,a boarding place sort of,but you can my sure he or she has plenty of water and it will be ok till you get back|`|GaL66jbQaa	you could hire someone, or take her with you but 10 hours is a long time for a puppy.

Cold weather can lead to hypothermia, and hot weather can lead to overheating. However, if you bought your dog from a local breeder, ask the breeder to take the dog for the day. The breeder of my german shepherd used to take our dog when we went away. Also, if you have a very clean garage with nothing the dog can chew or get into, this is also an option. Make sure garage will not get cold, and put a blanket down. Do not leave any choking hazards laying around, paint cans, dog toys,etc. Lastly, this can also be done by barricading a kitchen as well. Leave plenty of water and food, and if pup poops and pees in kitchen or garage, simply mop when you get home.|`|0diOaNoxaa	You still have time to find a pet sitter. What area are you in ? Just do an internet search for pet sitters in your area. Also, some PetSmart stores have boarding. A lot of vets have boarding. There are tons of independant petsitters everywhere these days. Try Sleepover Rover on the internet.<br>  <br>  Please don't leave your puppy in the crate for 9 hours. There are tons of alternatives.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Tough call ... <br>  <br>  Maybe you can take the dog with you and board it for just the day.  A lot of places will allow you to drop it off and pick it up the same day.  Try to set that up as early as possible.|`|xQeolc88aa	It is probably too much for an active puppy.

That way you can enjoy the wedding, knowing your pup is taken care of.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	NO thats cruel. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'll take care of her!! <br>  Or, take her to a dog kennel.They have doggy day care too everywhere and you could do that.

And I think it will mess up your work with house training because the schedule won't be there anymore and she'll wonder if she is allowed to go in her crate or hold it. Too much psychological pressure there!<br>  <br>  I would suggest looking into a boarding facility or something just for that day. That way you can give them your potty schedule and it won't be much different for you.<br>  <br>  But my number one decision would be to take her with you! It'll be a fun little adventure, right? You can have her drive over with you, give her a bathroom break, crate her for the actual wedding, let her out again and let her have some exercise and another bathroom break, then see what happens from there. If there's going to be a family lunch, then see if an adult is staying home to watch kids. If there is, ask if they'd be willing to watch your puppy. I mean, kids love puppies and it would entertain the children while the adults and older kids were out to eat! Then you can watch her in your spare time and crate her for the reception and what-not. Not to mention this option is free!<br>  <br>  I think taking her with you will advance her socializing skills and will cause you less money and over-all less stress. If it's this Saturday, good luck finding a boarding kennel! Not to mention the fact that it will cause your dog some stress, not all kennels follow your schedule, and she can get sick or injured from those places.<br>  <br>  But it's definitely your call. I know weddings can be extremely stressful, so if having a puppy there will make it more stressful for everyone, put your dog in a boarding kennel. But if it won't be too much of a problem, just take her with you! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Maximum of 5 hours.  You'll need to have someone pet sit or at least go to your place a couple times to let the dog go outside while you are gone.  Or kennel your dog for the day.
3BMBZtDxaa	Some male dogs don't lift their legs actually. They have to be taught. I know it sounds funny, but some don't because they weren't taught as puppies! This often happens with shelter dogs, if he was a rescue. Or if he was pulled from the litter early. So lifting the leg isn't a sign of puberty.<br>  <br>  Peeing on beds and sofas is often a dominance issue. Time for some training! This will happen a lot in male dogs, especially when they're reaching the age of one year old. So maybe your dog is reaching it early, or you haven't taught him some manners. Either or, it's time to step up the training!<br>  <br>  You ought to not allow him up on the couches or the bed until you get him fully house trained. It's best. Once he's older and you have his peeing issues under control, then you can let him up if you would like. But right now, just keep him off.<br>  <br>  You should work on establishing yourself as the leader, because peeing on places like the bed where you sleep is saying that he believes he's above you. The bed and sofa is where your scent is the most. So he's basically peeing on you! <br>  <br>  Just work on training, don't let him up on the furniture, and establish yourself more as a leader and you're good to go!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Get him neutered, keep him off the furniture and better start being strict with him cause it sounds like he's starting to be a very dominant dog and that could spell trouble.

He not only proved that force is necessary but that he was crazy.|`|4g11TWnraa	He wont start lifting his leg tell he is 9 months and there is stuff called dog away that works put it on things U don't want him to pee on and see if it works|`|BPiQhhdGaa	I would say from experience that this is a lot like doggie puberty yes...but not quite exactly like a human going through it. If he is doing these actions as you say..<br>  I would say it is time to get him neutered.<br>  Not only is it much safer for him to be neutered...but it will most likely save you from having a couch or bed full of animal urine. =) hope i could help.
TkJn9gO0aa	Where are you located? Usually the cheapest plae is local.....this eliminates shipping costs. Otherwise, even if you found a crested gecko for $10 on the internet, you're still looking at $45-$50 shipping for that one animal.<br>  <br>  My advice, go to an actual reptile expo or reptile show.....I guarantee you will find the lowest prices there. I picked up 10 cresteds for $280 at the last show I went to...........that's about $28 per gecko!|`|sSJ8zfebaa	try craigs list-also  google reptile shows-they have great pricing
iJtuhLMTaa	Just keep posting.   If your dog has a long crop it can take up to 18 months for the ears to stand correctly in some lines.   If your dog have a very long crop and lacks the proper ear to support the crop then yes reropping is an option.    Your breeder would be the best person to make suggestions but if they are not available my suggestion would be to find a vet that does custom cropping and is experience in Dobermans or find a good show breeder and ask their options of if the ear will eventually stand with continued posting or not.  If not then you can discuss other options with the vet.   Implants have their own risks which you should discuss with your vet, however keep in mind if you plan on showing implants would be a disqualification.<br>  <br>  Edit: Leaving them down for a day is what the problem is.  The ears should be left down for more time that it takes them to dry after you have removed the tape and cleaned them to repost.  Allowing them to stay down for and extend time and especially allowing the puppy to sleep on the ears when they are down is a big no-no.   Again I would recommend having and experienced cropping vet or an experienced show breeder to look at her ears and help you determine if the cartilage in the ear has developed a crease from being left down to long.  If it has then some type of corrective surgery such as implants or stringing will be necessary for them to stand (a re-crop won't do any good)  If they have not then continuing to post and not leaving them down should eventually get them to stand on their own.  A show crop can take up to 18 months to stand properly on some dogs so unless you are sure a crease has developed in the cartilage don't give up on her so soon|`|Ei85kgfdaa	If the crop was done well then there should be sufficient amount of bell left on the ear and they should be able to support the cartiledge at the top. How old is the dog? Sometimes you have to continue to post the ears after a year old. Keep posting and don't leave them down for longer then it takes for the ears to dry after cleaning.<br>  <br>  For adult dogs there is a procedure calling stringing the ears but it depends on the problem with the ear and where the crease is.|`|PmiMgmf4aa	Your dogs ears were probably not done very well, and implants may harm you dogs ears more. I have had dobermans for years and have used popsicle sticks to post the ears, and they work very well, chances are that theey will either stand with persistance, but if not then it is not really a big problem, you just cant show the dog. Just keep trying sometimes it just takes awhile for the ears to stand.|`|tTLg4u9laa	I say that is what you get for chopping off your dog's ears.  I should hope that anyone who physically mutilates their dog sees all their "hard work" of racking or whatever **** sees the ears fall back down in a few days time.<br>  <br>  Cropping will soon be outlawed in the US, just wait and see.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Shouldn't have had them cropped in the first place. It's purely aesthetic and not required for the show ring any longer.<br>  Implants can be very dangerous.<br>  The muscle will either strengthen on its own or it won't.  Re cropping is NOT an option.  It's stupid.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Did a Vet do your ear cropping?  Racking?  Did you have the ears taped?|`|iD23RJ6iaa	no this is mean to the dog

xCvOSzpJaa	ME FOR MY RODENT|`|bgcrVoqsaa	what are you talking about????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????...|`|w9OiRqPcaa	okay :]<br>  your answer is... i want carrots (:|`|HE558QgXaa	um...what's your question???
AA12169071	Well whenever you ask a question...here is my 2 cents...or better yet..my 2 points :)
RkK673VHaa	how long have u had it it could still be settling in this takes some time and it might not eat, or it could just not be hungry<br>  <br>  but they are insectivores and should be fed on a diet of insects.
TkbaEic0aa	ewww,, she likes to drink flavored water,,, and thats a fishy water (just like vitamin water) LMAO|`|OjXvYEZDaa	Aww! maybe she like to drink water out of tank while seeing some fish there and thinking about catch fish for her lunch.. You should get lid for tank water to stop her drink water from there also keep your fish more safer!|`|9d593f749c34acbeaf347dbd42b491ecaa	Sounds like she likes the aeration of the water from the filter.  She would probably like the water dishes that recirculate the water.  There are many varieties with different types of action.|`|gYNi22IUaa	To shorten it; cats love fish food!<br>  Fish scales get very dirty and the scum goes in the water, making it smell like fish.
10AaMUfraa	Why breed her at all?  Will she contribute to her species that well?  Are you prepared to pay a large vet bill or having her die from birthing problems?  She will bleed and swell for several days before taking a dog.  This allows her to draw a crowd and the best will be the one to breed.  In heat is words used to say she is "hot" and sending out messages to the area dogs.  She gets pregnant after breeding during her heat cycle.  With your experience I would suggest not trying to be a dog breeder yet until you get more familiar with what "cycle" is.  Breeding is easier than whelping!  You will be real lost then.  You can have her spade now but she will bleed more due to the increased size of her uterus.  You should keep her isolated for about 2-3 WEEKS from when you first noticed the bleeding.  Dogs will tear up doors and dig to the center of the earth to get to her.  She will NOT be safe to walk in public.  Should she get breed you can have the vet give her the morning after shot which only makes her heat cycle last longer to keep eggs from attaching.|`|xQeolc88aa	Yes and yes.<br>  She is in heat, and she can get pregnant while in heat. Make sure you keep her under your watch at all times, never leave her in the yard unattended (male dogs will find their way to her), buy her pet panties, and schedule an appointment with the vet to spay her.|`|RiW4tSx6aa	ok wen ur dog goes threw heat that means that she can get pregnant if she find a mate like if she id leding and a dog walks by and gets on top of her than she is most likly going to have puppies if u know what i mean email me at purplefly6@yahoo .com|`|KxjUim7yaa	Yes she could be in heat and yes she could get bred. Breeding is usually in the middle of the heat. She is too young to have a family. Please spay. Now would be a good time to arrange for it.|`|AA10265922	yes she is coming in heat,they bleed a week before and a week after,make sure you keep her AWAY from other dogs,make sure she can not get out!!!they go through 'wanting' to roam when this is going on,dogs will come from everywhere,JUST MAKE SURE SHE CAN NOT GET OUT OR NO DOG CAN GET IN|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If she's bleeding she's in the middle of her month long heat cycle and can get pregnant for the next week or two of she ties with a male.<br>  <br>  Don't breed until she's titled, health certified, at least 2 1/2, registered, and to an approved male.|`|nd30LQhlaa	yes and yea..iif you dont want her pregnant now then watvch her like a hawk because male dogs will come from miles!! lol<br>  and dont listien to the people who "yell" at you for wanting to breed her someday. and good luck!|`|RDsZFfLOaa	yes she is in heat, the only way for her to get pregnant is when she is in heat so keep her away from any males that are not neuter.|`|iRGC6bWsaa	buy a doggy diaper let her wear it and take her to the vet and talk to them and they can find whats wrong or if she wll become pregnant
uWpwXn6paa	Try liveaquaria.com they have a compatibility chart.|`|cZSqCvVBaa	Well, you have to consider size, color, temperament, loner or schooler fish.  Good starter fresh water fish are sword tails, mollies & platies. Neon tetras are bright blue and red and are in schools and fast. Angelfish are slow and elegant. If you want to have a more aggressive tank get a Jack Dempsey, firemouth, green terror, gourami, convicts. Have fun, I miss my tanks!|`|a3FAGYgVaa	It really depends on how big your tank is.<br>  <br>  Some fishes are happy in groups of the same specie, others prefer to be in groups but are just as happy with other species, and others can't be put with any other of their same specie.<br>  <br>  In a smaller tank you should then keep only 2-3 species at most, in bigger tanks you can afford to diversify more.<br>  <br>  A cool combo for a smaller tank (15-30 gallons) would be 3-5 cory cats (they are only happy in groups of same species) and 1 or 2 species of tetras, 6-10 individuals per specie (depending on how big a tank and how big the tetras get as adults).<br>  <br>  Anything smaller than 15 gallons, I would suggest only keeping 5-10 tetras of the same specie.
TkJn9gO0aa	Sounds like a common amphibian bacterial infectious disease called "Red-Leg" where the legs will turn red exposing the blood vessels and then they legs will fall off.<br>  <br>  You probably didn't wash the cage thoroughly after the first one died and the other picked up the disease in that manner.<br>  <br>  Here's some more information about Red Leg Disease and how to prevent it = <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/guides/reptiles/frogs/redlegdisease.html" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/guides/repti...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: The most likely place to get the meds is gonna be your local vet's. I wouldn't say all the symptoms usually take place with he disease either..........when I was young and ignorant, I killed a few newts the same way by simply not properly cleaning the cage from animal to animal. It might very well be a different disease entirely from "RedLeg", as many of the common ailments with amphibians are strikingly similar to each other. However, I can almost guarantee that the 2nd one caught the disease from the bacteria that was left from the 1st frog.
RloOJ43haa	I have struggled with the same problem with my Dutch Warmblood. What has helped me is to sit up more in the air. It's a bit counter intuitive because your instinct is to go more forward on a big jump. However, when the horse jumps bit, you need to sit up more.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	i would suggest riding in a neck strap (an old stirrup leather you put around your horse's neck). that way your can grab onto that to help you find your balance. (obviously, keep one hand on the reins)<br>  you could also try grabbing a bit of mane before the jumps.<br>  going into 2-point early will help you adjust to her jump too. i'm not saying go into it 5 strides out, but a stride before the jump never hurts, especially if you know your horse won't refuse. <br>  eventually you two will find your rhythm, it just takes a little time, especially on horses with big, scope-y jumps.|`|0DhFhzDGaa	Hang on to the mane!! i just to have an arabian like that, and I had to hang on to the mane. It helps..<br>  <br>  Ovcourse it is hard to get into a habbit of grabing the mane, and once you get into that habbit it is hard to get out of!<br>  <br>  I shaved his mane when my trainer started to ask me to stop holding onto the mane because I had become use to  his jump....<br>  <br>   There is a mare in the barn who has a insane athletic jump!  Even when my trainer is on her she gets nervous jumping the mare..<br>  <br>  We have an extremly hilarious piture of my trainer practically hugging her neck over a 3'3 fence because she felt like she was not giving enough, and just kept giving more and more...<br>  <br>  Those horses are so fun, yet so hard!!<br>  <br>  I hope you find something that works out!!|`|2nsNvIanaa	hold on. b at 1 wit hte horse. work wit her not against her.|`|AA11621713	lol I've had to deal with quite a few horses like this.  <br>  The first thing, as mentioned before, remember to grab mane.  This can be very helpful but is easily forgotten.  <br>  <br>  Leading up to the jump be in a light 3 point.  As she takes off hold the 3 point slightly longer than you normally would before folding all the way into a two point.  Trust me, even though it seems like it would make it harder, staying up and waiting longer makes all the difference!  As long as you are in a 3 point, or "half seat", before the jump, you won't get left behind, or at least not too bad.  You would rather get left behind than get ahead of her.  <br>  <br>  Also, really push your heels down and slightly forward.  Otherwise, as soon as your lower leg goes back and she takes a big leap, you're going to lose balance.
y0cbLn0Yaa	Nice looking breed, unfortunately when I google Hovawart breeders in Australia there were no hits and they are not a breed recognised by the ANKC so if anyone has imported them they will be hard to find.<br>  <br>  Good luck though.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	they're not on the ANKC breed listings or dogzonline.
5M57TTfpaa	thats kinda cute. i have never done that to my rabbits, i wonder if they do it too?
9kTejB0uaa	Suggest you try Battersea Dogs' Home, or Wood Green Animal Shelter.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise contact the relevant Breed Club websites and find a reputable breeder.  Far too many of these small dogs are being produced by the unscrupulous.  Buying a puppy from a local source isn't necessary the right way to go - you may strike lucky and find a good breeder, but you are more likely going to find a BYB.  Be prepared to travel for the right puppy!  And steer clear of puppy sale websites.|`|2O58btqxaa	try epups or pets4homes|`|o6Sa4OAaaa	hey, I have 4/6 great puppies, they are 4 weeks old now, eat by them self and are great.

uBFhKXgHaa	Then you might want to look into switching, because Eukanuba is a low quality dog food!<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies.

wLgGD63raa	That's why I don't use sand. If she is impacted you need to soak her in WARM water at least once a day, this may help her have a bowel movement. Wax worms are probably not the best for them because it's basically just feeding them potato chips. They need the heater on at all times, if her belly was cold when you picked her up this is probably the reason why she hasn't been eating. Leo's don't lose weight over night, this sounds me like this is an ongoing issue. When was the last time she pooped? If she's having bowel movements then she more than likely isn't impacted. Chances are your set up is the problem. What are you keeping her in, what are the temperatures?|`|fBMSIlSIaa	I dont know much about geckos but from what you have said, Im sure she is just freaked out by the bath. Just give her a little time and just pay attention to the little girl for the next few hours. If this continues, you could phone the vet and see if the have any advice. Good luck and hopes shes okay!|`|zhPCz46laa	If you really care take her to a vet. <br>  <br>  As for the lighting follow this, 6am-6pm light is on, and if you have a heat pad (probably should if you don't) put that on at 11pm-6am. That'll help regulate the gecko's sleeping time. <br>  <br>  Check yout temperatures as well-very important if the temp is too cold that might be why there is some digestion trouble.|`|zTeLhroWaa	I read somewhere that if you have an impacted gecko you can try putting olive oil on her nose and letting her lick it off.  It'll help the obstruction pass.  Shouldn't give her a lot though...just a few drips.<br>  <br>  I don't know for sure as I house all my geckos on solid substrate just for that reason.  It might benefit you to do some research on impaction and olive oil though.

P2yRAWiJaa	An english mastiff or greyhound would NOT be good apartment dogs.  A mastiff is way to large for an apartment life, isn't lazy indoors and won't be to quiet.  A greyhound needs lots of exercise.  A Malamute isn't a good choice either.  The shedding isn't an issue for you but they need mental stimulation and a lot of exercise so wouldn't be "lazy" either.<br>  The only ones out of your picks are the Corgi or Basset Hound.  A basset will be lazy, but not really quiet.  A Corgi will be quieter, still shed a bit, definitely not a guard dog (unless trained) and is relatively lazy indoors.  Still needs exercise daily though. :)<br>  <br>  I'd go with the Corgi.|`|W0buucLsaa	Disclaimer: I don't know anything about Corgis, so I'm leaving them out.<br>  <br>  A Malamute will definitely not be quiet or lazy indoors. In fact, this list looks like a "Which of these breeds does not belong?" standardized test question for how much the other breeds will work well in an apartment and how much the Malamute WON'T. <br>  <br>  Of the other three, Basset Hounds and Mastiffs make a decent bit of noise. They're not as bad as like, labs, but they aren't known for being quiet breeds.<br>  <br>  So Greyhounds are the best choice out of all the big dogs. A Newfoundland would also be good. They're about as quiet as Greyhounds, but even lazier indoors. They're also lazy outdoors.|`|AA10112346	I would say go with a basset hound, or maybe even a greyhound. I own a hound myself, a beagle, a basset though are generally more layed back and couch potatoes, being hounds they howl, but the basset's howl is really unique. It is like a low rumble. :D They dont need tons of exercise..They tend to have lower back problems though.|`|GaL66jbQaa	My vote is Mastiff  but be prepared to tail proof your apartment. They are generally pretty laid back but they are not a beginner dog and poorly bred mastiffs havge a lot of problems and a short life.<br>  <br>  The greyhound is a good choice too.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	What about a Whippet.  They have energy outside but are total couch potatoes.|`|AA10265922	YORKIE!!!! no doubt|`|AA11228933	A papillon sounds like the dog for you. Any type of lap-type dog. Corgis are sometimes clever and seek revenge for you not sticking to their routine. But all dogs need attention and to be socialized with other dogs and people to avoid phobias in the future.<br>  Also exercise is a must and daily is a minimum requirement of any healthy pet. You really get what you invest of your time, energy and love when you have a pet. You sound like you have thought it through but maybe not as carefully as you can w/o advice and experience.<br>  My dog of 14 yrs has reached beyond my expectation because of the sharing each day and learning her signals while she is learning mine.<br>  I truly love all dogs and I would hope that you don't get one simply for the fact that you may not have the 15 yr. commitment it takes to devote to a loyal and loving companion.- feeding,watering, scooping, paying-vet bills are the realities and if the dedication isn't there then please re-consider. -A malamute? really? In an Apartment?|`|xQeolc88aa	I think your best bet is an older dog, maybe about 5 years old? You can search your local rescues for a dog that matches the temperament you are looking for. <br>  <br>  I would not recommend greyhound, as it is an active dog. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, any dog can be a lazy quiet apartment dog, if you offer him enough exercise. I live with an extremely athletic American Pit Bull Terrier, and she will sleep her day away in the house. But she does get couple of hours of exercise and mental stimulation a day.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Greyhounds are huge coach potatoes but still need a lot of exercise. As long as you can get it outside as much as possible to run and roam for a good while, it should work fine.<br>  <br>  I really don't think a Malamute is a great choice because they have high amounts of energy and need things to keep them busy a lot of the time.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure about the other 3. Good luck.|`|4bPizbOLaa	Well i have a shihtzu and she is lazy and doesn't shed but she guards alot and barks a little.<br>  <br>  Ive had alot of chiwawa's in the past but they are all usually loud.<br>  <br>  um if big dogs are not a problem then id reccomend the basset hound.<br>  <br>  <br>  but i would not want to put any big dogs in risk of not having any outdoor time.|`|RiW4tSx6aa	maybe a small do if u have tv watch dogs 101 on animal planet if u have newfonderlands there they are good apartment dogs so are dashounds i have a mini one and i lived in a apartment and she was great|`|HdOVYIWjaa	Go to dogbreedinfo.com.

They will get restless if they don't get a chance to really stretch their legs every now and again.  Walks aren't quite enough for them.<br>  <br>  Bassets - ok, have you ever heard one bark?  You do not want one of these in an apartment.  You and your dog would be thrown out in very short order.<br>  <br>  Corgis - Corgies need less exercise than other herding dogs, but they are still herding dogs and need walks.  I love them.  I think they make great apartment dogs so long as they get a good walk every day.  With those short legs, they don't need long, long walks either. <br>  <br>  Don't know much about Mastiffs, except they're big.  lol.<br>  <br>  Malamute - not in an apartment.  It needs more room than all that and in all fairness, it needs it's own fenced yard.  The others will cope without it but the Malamute ... that would be cheating it.<br>  <br>  I've worked with all the dogs listed except for Mastiff's.  Out of your list, I think the Corgi would be the best.|`|mtoUep7Iaa	Basset hond because it is cute<br>  <br>  <br>  they howl<br>  <br>  <br>  Instantly recognizable due to its big, heavy body, short legs and long ears, the Basset Hound has proven itself to be a multi-purpose dog that excels in conformation, obedience, tracking, field trialing and pack hunting. The breed is known for its strong hunting instinct and, if given the opportunity, will chase or follow a scent willingly. Because of its gentle, non-confrontational nature, the Basset can be used for hunting in packs or alone. The Basset can be any hound color, which includes combinations of black, tan, white, red and other colors.<br>  <br>  A Look Back<br>  The Basset Hound was originally developed in France as a trailer of small game that hunters could follow on foot. Bassets continued to achieve very notable popularity during the reign of Emperor Napoleon, and in 1880 Queen Alexandra kept Basset Hounds in the royal kennels. Marquis de Lafayette brought Basset Hounds, known for their impeccable sense of smell, to the United States as a gift to President George Washington to use in his hunting expeditions.|`|ElbK2HRBaa	you should get a SMALL dog because if you are out some days some big dogs get bored very easily and could ruin your furniture|`|xIAeovIUaa	greyhound. definately|`|oXaRWvOIaa	go with the greyhound|`|HolCibP8aa	not a bassett.

d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	As the older a cat gets, the longer the organs have worked.  Things get worn out, and as the organs start to fail, it makes them more susceptible to opportunists. It's the same with us humans.  We've had several patients who we've had documentations on for nearly 20 years with little problems.|`|AA10558731	Honey, it's the nature of all animals to sicken as they age, cats included. My two longest-lived cats, Calypso & Tasha, lived to be 16 & 18 respectively. Calypso suffered from cancer of the lymph system, I had her treated when she was about 10 years old but it came back partway through her 16th year and ultimately killed her. Tasha had very good health her entire life, but old age did a number on her kidneys in her later years.<br>  <br>  I had them each put down when it became apparent that their quality of life had deteriorated to the point where it was cruel to try to keep them alive any longer. It was not an easy decision; both had worked their way deep into my heart over the years, easily becoming as close as any human in my life. But I did what had to be done, and strongly feel they understood why I did it, and approved.<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, there are those who believe cats & dogs that we adopt as family pets have immortal souls, and are always a part of us. I know I'll see Calypso & Tasha again.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Something will eventually get them, as with us.<br>  I had two female cats get to 16.5 and 17 years. And two males get to 14 and 14 1/3 years.

If you don't die in an accident you will die of some sickness.  It's true of all animals.|`|4yt4D3vMaa	Basically the cells in the body renew themselves throughout an animal's life and the older they get the more times cells are renewed, which leads to more DNA damage(lifestyle and environmental factors also play a part) and cell damage or cells dying. This is what causes organs to become diseased and age which leads to sickness in the animal. Some animals are genetically more prone to ageing and disease than others and again lifestyle etc plays a part which is why some cats live well into their 20s and others don't. My cat lived to 19 but had kidney disease for at least the last 5 years of her life so she wasn't exactly healthy-she was very happy though and had a good quality of life.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Well eveyone when they grow old gets sick.<br>  <br>  As far as your question, I have a 16 year old girl right now that acts like she is 6 and has always been healthy.

Pregnancy and nursing are hard on a dog that is not in top condition and especially hard when they are that young.  The hair falling out is normal for the most part.  I would put her on a high quality puppy food - no corn, no soy, no wheat and no by products and a named meat in meal form as the first ingredient and a high calorie vitamin supplement like Nutrical or Nutristat until you can get her back to an optimum weight.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the loss of your puppy.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U need to get her to a vet.

Tell me you were feeding her a high quality puppy food during her pregnancy and while nursing. Sorry for your loss, but there are some things I would have done differently. Remove the other puppy for it's safety. Take mom to the vet.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	TAKE HER TO THE VET!!!!  Lord, how much simpler could it get than that?|`|3BMBZtDxaa	13 month old? Over 13 weeks ago??<br>  <br>  I don't think this is a cause of trauma for her, I think it's the fact that you bred her WAY to early.|`|nd30LQhlaa	she sounds like she might be stresssed out that would explain the loss of hair and appitiet. and she may be upset about the other puppy...and also the puppy thats left may be sick...because mother dogs do get agressive towards their puppies if their sick or dieing...maybe call a vet..or take the puppy to the vet and see if its sick? <br>  I hope everything is okay...good luck!|`|frpCK0utaa	I'm sorry so many people are giving you crap. Take her to the vet as soon as you can. the hair falling out is not a good sign. Shes probably traumtized by the early birth and losing her baby. Shes grieving, which would explain the not eating.|`|X1tawExBaa	That doesn't seem normal.call your vet|`|GaL66jbQaa	First of all your dog should be at least 2years old and have a conformation or working title before breeding.  No that is not ok she needs a vet.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You let your pup get run over.  You have a 1 yr old female that never should have been bred and a dead 13 wk old puppy. Yeah, you are a great owner *sarcasm, btw*.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like your female needs to see a vet.  It's definitely not natural.  <br>  <br>  FYI - if your pup was run over in the woods, while you were in the backyard doing yard work, then you weren't paying attention to him now were you?  Guess it takes a dead pup to learn how to care for them huh?  Sad really.  But...at least he's in a better place and won't be homeless due to a byb owner that let his mom get knocked up.|`|Qe04KxYoaa	OK you breed her while she was still a pup herself you make her stay outside with the pups when they are so young they should be inside. You do not watch them when they are outside and yes you let one of them get run over because a responsible owner and breeder would never have left a 13 week old pup outside without supervision. Your dog is sick take her to the vet. While there make an appointment and have her fixed. I hate BYB<br>  <br>  <br>  Why is she not inside with the pups? Pups that young should not be outside roaming free.|`|XNxFBrbAaa	it sounds like the mom may need a vet visit to be on the safe side...and she is a husky so they loose there hair in clumps..its called "blowing"(i owned a husky) as for the pup that got ruhn over....you probbaly shoulda watched over it better...but i wont lecture someone who lost a pet...poor form i believe....but def take the mom to a vet...and since your gunna be there maybe take the remaining pups there to..just to have them checked up..|`|f5b78ca790f28d61bc84d5e3260b15ffaa	Stuff like that can be very traumatic for a dog. Just imagine that you were the mom and you saw your own kid(pup) get run over. Yeah it would be depressing to the dog. so give the dog a lot of attention and play with the dog . to really get its self esteem up. maybe take it to a park or a walk hopefully it will work. and im sorry for the loss|`|MjqOYIQvaa	ummm...just to say about CaseyD.T comment..you said at least one or two years....13 months is over a year....<br>  anyway....it is to young to breed. My cat got out and got pregnant on her first heat...she acted the same way. She was aggresive towards the babies, and was never herself until about 6 months later....You need to remove the puppies and take her to the vet about her weight.|`|jBOHWOBtaa	It is the best thing to take it to the vet or the Pet Hospital or whatever they call it. They will need special care if they are like this...<br>  Besides, you can't breed a dog when she is 13 months. That is just way, way too early for a female dog. You had to wait until she is atleast 1 or 2 years old. Those years are fine, but 13 months?!<br>  Sounds like she 's still a puppy.
AA10265922	might better take her in for a checkup,may be something else,they will find out what it is|`|PM23RDycaa	Call your vet and have a spay scheduled for her. They can tell you if she was pregnant or not. At her age she is too old for a first litter.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Sounds sick to me. <br>  I think it'd be best to take her to the vet. <br>  And while you're there, get her spayed as well. The you wont have anymore "I think she's pregnant" moments.|`|33PwXUblaa	k she sounds sick so get her to the vet!<br>  <br>  This is not making fun of you but if you got a dog.....you should have known a lil(atleast) !<br>  But....call the vet and tell them the symptoms and get a n app!<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I am sorry sweetie.......you got pups on the way <br>  so still get her to the vet!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Pregnant or not depends if she has been in heat and if she was bred. Throwing up should not be a sign fo pregnancy in a dog. Please have the vet see her as it might be something serious.|`|uhlPVTdkaa	could be take her to the vet|`|10AaMUfraa	Something else is very wrong.  Dogs don't have human systems.  I'm not laughing so don't get offended when I tell you to get and education and read about what you have.  You should know if she is spade or not.  If you have had her for 9-12 months you would already know if she is a breeding ***** or a good nice spaded pet.  <br>  <br>  Throwing up is a sign of either over eating and wanting to share with the pack or sick.  Domestic dogs don't purge if they are not worried about where the next meal will be.  Bred bitches don't get lazy or they would die in the wild.  Think about your dog as an animal and know what the natural behavior is and how they interact with a pack member.  Treat them as a dog because they will teach you to act socially as a dog because that is all they know.  They don't understand time and date as it has no relevance in their lives.  They don't understand human social manners (farting in public is funny to you but just goes unnoticed by other pack members unless it stunk bad and they don't want to smell it either, bathing why?  no public personal scratching).  They rely on a leader and are happy if it is you IF you take command of the leadership this leaves them comfortable being just a member with no great responsibilities.|`|4bPizbOLaa	Take her for a check-up to check but your not stupid or crazy these are signs of animals pregnancy and i would also recommend getting better high fattening dog food with lots of vitamins and minerals.|`|QsmYEs8Iaa	na I dont think its pregnet but check if it has like little boobs and you dont sound stupid she might be sick take her to the vet asap|`|7OuNY2q9aa	might better take her in for a checkup,may be something else,they will find out what it is|`|nd30LQhlaa	she might be..the vet can do a blood  test to tell you for sure.<br>  and your not stupid.|`|mtoUep7Iaa	she sounds sick <br>  what did she eat|`|mFWf5uWOaa	i don't think so take her to the vet she sounds sick
qqUvoC5uaa	Now where in the world did they get "Teddy Bear" out of Shih Tzu, Poodle, and Yorkshire Terrier?<br>  Sounds like a mutt too me. But that's even going on a limb for the designer mutt name creators. <br>  <br>  Shih Tzu<br>  Height:  Up to 11 inches (28cm.)<br>  Weight: 9-16 pounds (4-7kg.)<br>  <br>  Toy Poodle<br>  Height:  up to 10 inches (25.4 cm.)<br>  Weight: 6-9 pounds (3-4 kg.)<br>  <br>  Yorkshire Terrier<br>  Height:  6-7 inches (15-17?cm.)<br>  Weight: 7 pounds (3.2kg.)<br>  <br>  I'd say anywhere between 6 and 16lbs. Yeah 10lbs is a pretty big range for such a small dog, but that's what happens. <br>  You wont be able to tell until your pup grows up. And if you get him/her and later find out he/she weighs more than 10lbs, I really hope you at least do the courtesy of keeping her.<br>  <br>  Add: <br>  There are also Miniature Poodles which may be the "poodle" in the mix<br>  in which case:<br>  Height:  11-15 inches (28-38 cm.)<br>  Weight:  15-17 pounds (7-8 kg.)<br>  <br>  That changes the weight range to 7-17lbs <br>  Looks more and more like the dog will weigh over 10lbs. <br>  <br>  Getting a purebred would give you a better idea. Plus you wouldn't be supporting a BYB<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add: <br>  Upon doing some research on the "Teddy Bear" I've found that what is called a "Teddy Bear" is not solely a Shih Tzu, Poodle & Yorkie. <br>  But it seems to describe either a rather intricate mutt, or simply there is a wide range of what can be called a "teddy bear"<br>  "poodle, bichon, shih-tzu, lhasas, Maltese, Pekingnese, westies and yorkies"<br>  Also, I have read in many places that all a "teddy bear" refers to is a Bichon Frise mixed with a Shih Tzu.|`|qioH81tiaa	I hope you are adopting it, not buying it and thus supporting bad breeding and unhealthy dogs.<br>  <br>  As to the size - there is no telling with mutts, as there is no standard for them.  Sorry.|`|AA10112346	Im so confused! I thought canines were dogs and bears bears?<br>  <br>  Why would you want a SUPER mutt?<br>  adopt dude.|`|XagPxe7Faa	There is no such thing as a "teddy bear" Yorkie.  It's merely a descriptive, cute marketing name.  The standard for the Yorkie (as you should know since you are getting one) is "under 7 lbs."  If you have carefully researched and found a reputable breeder that adheres to the breed standard, then your dog will meet that criteria.  Determining how big the dog will get would require having knowledge on the size and genetics of the parents and the lineage of the dog.  Unfortunately, because of the popularity of the breed and BYBers jumping on the bandwagon with indiscriminate breeding practices, there are Yorkies with characteristics and sizes all over the scale.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that before you make a long term committment to any dog of any breed, you educate yourself on the breed first.  It will give you a good idea of what to expect with the dog and make you aware of what red flags to look for with breeders.  (Advertising teacups/minis/teddy bear etc, breeding multiple breeds or mixed dogs, excessive litters, etc)  Be sure that you are aware of the breed specific illnesses that plague Yorkies and ask the breeder about each SPECIFICALLY to ensure that proper medical testing has been done.  These days a simple "they were vet checked" is not good enough.  Also, you should be well versed on the breed standard so that you can determine if a dog you are considering is a quality representation of the breed, thus denoting an ethical breeder.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|XNxFBrbAaa	there is no such thing as a teddy bear...and i think thats the first time i have ever heard of this new "designer" dog....its just a mix of 3 diff dogs....and liek some said i hope your adopting this dog and not paying like 300 dollars for a mix breed that is claimed to be a actual breed...and sicne there is no way of telling how much it will weigh....then i dont think you should get it...if it ends up being over 10plbs yer prolly just gunna get rid of it and how un fair would that be for the dog...just dont get one....|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You're getting a mutt and want to know how big it will get.  It's a mix of 3 breeds. It has no standards. <br>  <br>  A shih tzu is relatively small - under 10 lbs I believe.  Yorkies are 7 lbs average.  Poodle depends on if it's a toy or mini.  Go to akc.org and look up each of the 3 breeds and you'll get a good idea.|`|pB6VukPMaa	Please take a look at this website I think it will answer most of your questions.  <a href="http://www.shihtzumixes.com/shichon%20puppies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shihtzumixes.com/shichon%20pu...</a>  <br>  I don't think it would be in your best interest to get this dog because it quite possibly could end up bigger than 10lbs and if this is a deal breaker for you then it's not at all fair to the dog.  I have 3 adopted dogs ranging from abot 10lbs to 20lbs and I originally wanted just a small purebred Maltese which should weigh 4-7lbs by AKC standards.  I am fascinated by the Teddybear dogs as I saw one in a pet store when I was going to purchase ome premium food for my dogs.  Anything teddybear fascinating me as this is my nickname .  Anyway the dog was a beautiful female puppy Shih Tzu Bichon Frise only bred.  I did some checking on that pet store and they are sound they are regulated by both AKC&CKC.  I don't support puppy mills and I drove 1400 miles round trip to get two of my adopted dogs, litter mates.  Just wanted to make that clear.

Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms<br>  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in<br>  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_Just_Fine_on_Dry_Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/#My_Cat_is_Doing_...</a><br>  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.   <br>   THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL<br>  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters<br>   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods.

AA10356572	for what country?
jDPULfjKaa	yes.....for now. Do you know the turtle tank rule? well if not the rule is to have '10 gallons per inch of shell" <br>  <br>  so 3 inches = at least 30 gallons ( at LEAST) <br>  <br>  but you know its much better to get that 50 gallon in the first place so you wont have to keep upgrading (useless) why not just get the largest tank first, ya know! So the next step is a 50  gallon, and being that you have a map turtle (small species) it might be the only tank you'll need after the upgrade. consider yourself lucky :)|`|hFgXi9cSaa	ya thats fine aslong as there's not to much water that should last his up to two year then u can switch to a 40 gal or so|`|u61yKsE3aa	It's reccomended to have 8-10 gallons of water per inch of shell length.  So if she is three inches long you shuld have 24-30 gallons of water.  That means your 35 can work for now as long as it is at least 3/4 full.  It won't last you long though, you will need to upgrade soon.

IuYekkPVaa	The peeing around the home might be a sign that he's suffering from a bladder or urinary infection, so it wouldn't hurt to have a vet check him over.  Definitely get him neutered.  It will have lots of health benefits and he'll be less inclined to fight. If you decide to let him outside make sure that he is vaccinated and microchipped too.<br>  <br>  Territory means everything to a cat, and they won't abandon a good one for no reason.  If your area is free from predators and other dangers, then he will return home every day.  Cats don't go looking for confrontation, so he will avoid the dogs next door.  However, if there is any way they can escape, that would give me cause for concern.<br>  <br>  You could also consider cat-proofing your garden so that he could go outside in relative safety.  These links have advice on how to do that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.woodycoon.com/html/cat-proof_fencing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.woodycoon.com/html/cat-proof_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/info.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fabcats.org/owners/fencing/in...</a><br>  <br>  If your budget allows, there are ready made cat proof fencing systems.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.purrfectfence.co.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catfencein.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catfencein.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Well I think 2 things<br>    He should be fixed and I believe it is ok to let him out.<br>    I too took in  a stray male and moved with him  along with my others <br>   He knew he was home with me and always came back when I let him out<br>   Fixing him will not only avoid pregnancies, it will avoid dangerous fights|`|qPgv4oWqaa	Even if u do decide to let him out, get him fixed! As for the peeing, my cats do the same thing, they're marking territory. Maybe try to put the litter box in a more obvious place. And try getting him a toy to play with so he'll have some fun, or a cat climbing house. because u live in an apartment, my opinion would be not to let him out. i hope this helped.|`|tGTvLTdBaa	First off I would suggest getting him fixed..A must if you DO happen to let him out...After all to many unwanted kitties running around as it is! But as far as the other part goes...Try getting him to see that the cat box is where he needs to be going... If you see him peeing pick him up and put him in the cat box. I wish you the best of luck|`|AA11716381	Regardless that he should be fixed anyways, neutering him will not fix this. My male has been neutered since he was a kitten, in the 4 years I've had him I've never let him outside and he still tries to go out the door.<br>  <br>  He should definitely definitely definitely be fixed if he is an outdoor cat. Nowhere needs anymore barn kittens running around lol.<br>  <br>  I am an strong believer that all cats should be indoors, there's too much risk going outside; fights with other cats/dogs/animals, risk of getting hit by a vehicle and also diseases. You would be surprised the amount of diseases or parasites an animal can catch, many of which can be passed onto any human like yourself or your husband and any other animal. Regardless of that, it's your choice to allow him to go outside or not, but as long as you're feeding him, he'll come back. Did he come back every night at your old place? If so he'll most likely do the same at your new house.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Getting him fixed "may" help. But I have both males and females and they do the same thing although fixed. I found two products that have really helped with this problem.<br>  NO MARK<br>  DUMB CAT<br>  Personally I've had the best luck with DUMB CAT. And it smells great too! They both come in small or large size.<br>  Oh another great product is GOOD CAT. That helps to calm them down and give them a feeling of wellbeing. He may be marking territory and this may help him feel less like doing that.<br>  I would hope you will keep him as inside only.

h6t4aRUOaa	If it is a real German Rottweiler it will have German registration papers. The breeder will give you the registration just like AKC only they are pink. Contact AKC because they need copies of the German Pink Papers and your dog will be dual registered.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD  German Rottweiler is not the breed name. It's a Rottweiler either imported from Germany or from German Registered and Imported parents. Some of the best Schutzhund Rottweilers I've seen are from German lines, most achieving a Schutzhund ll or lll at a very young age. Also German registries are very strict about inbreeding, breeding age and genetic health screening. A true German Rottweiler will not be cheap. Just think of the shipping. Don't let a BYB tell you "oh, it's german 'cause the head is different or it's bigger than American". A real one will have pink papers or it isn't German.|`|GaL66jbQaa	if he's registered in the internationally recognized kennel club in germany then yes|`|6SeWCfUfaa	<a href="http://www.akc.org/rules/special_registry_services.cfm#Germany" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/rules/special_registr...</a>|`|Os6VjLH0aa	If he's registered with FCI yes, go to www.AKC.org, you should be able to find the info you need there.

Between the different fish and possibly uneaten food, I'm not surprised it's cloudy and smelly.  It's not because of eggs from the females or bubbles from the males.  I've had females with eggs and males with bubbles and the water was never smelly and/or cloudy.<br>  <br>  Good for you for buying back the female.  It's been my experience that Petco bettas are always in poor health.  I go to Petsmart for mine now.|`|oXuLtEHyaa	I bought a male betta and my tank got very cloudy and smelly. Then I realized there were some bubble looking things on the top. I did some research and it showed that the male betta was making the bubbles so a female could lay her eggs in them.

They never did fight with each other.|`|lgM3xZkWaa	Never ever buy to female beta fish.Ever.I think they had some babies (or will,soon).
8i90ov0Gaa	Burmese pythons are one of the most, if not the most, susceptible to respiratory infections of any snake. They should never be exposed to temperatures under 80 degrees in their enclosure ever, so 73 is way too low. Keeping it at this temperature too long will most likely result in a respiratory infection. The hot side should be 90 to 92. 85 is too low for the hot side. Find a good heat source and keep it on 24/7. They don't need UVB lights, and I personally wouldn't use dirt because it will hard to clean and can easily harbor parasites and bacteria. I use newspaper for mine, but cypress mulch works fine as well. Never trust a pet store employee. Increased activity can be a sign of stress, but it is also a sign of being hungry. Burms have an amazing appetite. I personally start mine out on young rats and don't bother with mice.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	If you've had her less than 2 weeks, then she is probably stressed a bit and will need time to get used to her new home.  Are you measuring the temps with a temp gun or digital probe thermometer?  Other types of thermometers are not good (such as stick on or dial types--they are inaccurate and only used for air temps, not basking temps).  If being measured correctly, your temps sound fine.  How is the humidity?  They need fairly high humidity levels.  How large is the tank?  These guys as you know need quite a bit of room and grow extremely fast.  Here is a link to some good info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/burm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/burm.html</a>|`|3IUMh4Igaa	Most snakes are nocturnal. So they do move around and hunt at night. That is perfectly normal. It sounds like you have the cage set up perfect. You really don't need the UV Heat light though. You can keep the ceramic one in all the time. The natural light in your home is fine. Especially since they tend to want to hide during the day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck
nctxHm8Qaa	Of course they don't work...and you're lucky your dog hasn't been seriously injured by your idiot "cures".  It needs a vet and professional treatment.|`|PM23RDycaa	That's because you CAN'T cure mange at home.

Demodex and Sarcoptes are treated differently.  Home products simply won't work--you need prescription medications.

You go to a vet to get proper treatment.|`|XohJPdfTaa	Well my advice to you is to go to your family vet and than tell him the problem what you tried to cure it with. Because if you try to cure it on your own you could make it sicker. Also i am sorry to say this but if you do to much damage to it with different medications it could have to be put down. Lastly also once again i am sorry to say this but if you cannot afford the vet than please donate him to the haman Society i don't want to see it hert|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You can't.  Simple as that.  <br>  You don't know what kind of mange it is.  One is treatable and the other is hereditary but can be kept under control.<br>  You need to take it to the vet and get a skin scrape done to see what kind of mange it is.  The vet will then give you the correct MEDICATION.<br>  <br>  None of the crap you've used will work....ever!  It will make the dogs skin worse.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Borax is poisonous. Do not coat your dog in oil. The skin can't breath. Take it to the vet like a normal person. Don't treat when you don't know what you are doing.|`|GaL66jbQaa	There are different kinds of mange be a good parent and take it to the vet.|`|AA10265922	may as well take it to the vet,only way you are going to stop it,sorry|`|7vJNHaskaa	You don't.

1uvrkDWNaa	Phlebitis|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Thrombosis is just the presence of clots (in the jugular vein).  Thrombophlebitis is an active inflammatory process involving the development of blood clots on the roughened walls of the inflamed vein.  When there isn't evidence of active inflammatory disease, but the vein is blocked by clots, they just call it venous thrombosis, or in this case, jugular venous thrombosis.
nVZTGC23aa	Be warned that they can move around the tank, albeit slowly. This means that you will need to use foam filters over any power head intakes. Many hobbyists have lost anemones because of an unprotected power filter intake! You will probably not want to keep them in a reef tank with corals because they have a sting that can harm corals, fish and other anemones.

hKVOw1Sjaa	As a rule greyhounds are not a breed that bites or is aggressive this is a complete misconception by this interviewer,having said that if you are interested in getting an adult one get it thoroughly tested by the rescue centre as they temperament test all greyhounds before releasing them as there are some really horrid methods used by greyhound trainers to get greyhounds to race ie cats,rabbits ETC.As a puppy and socialized correctly and reared well you will not have an issue except being a hound it will want to take off it it sees a rabbit or something small moving in the distance but if you train your dog well this will not happen although you cannot completely change the instinct of the Hounds.Last part of your question you need a grand in the  Bank,where did the Interviewer get that info l rarely see greyhounds with any real health issues in the surgery l work at although yes there can be if they have been too closely bred but if you get it from the Rescue team they will tell you if it has any health issues.Who on earth would want to employ an idiot Interviewer like this?Not only ignorant but a fool as well.|`|dYluozLHaa	all dogs are "prone" to biting, it depends on the situation hes in|`|AA12205365	Greyhound rescues tend to not be good with children.

qUeNrusdaa	I strongly recommend you get a German Shepherd.  For three reasons:<br>  1.  They bond VERY well with their human family.<br>  2.  Many are very good with children, especially if the dog(s) has grown up around children.  (If raised around children, they tend to be very tolerant of tail- and ear-pulling, poking, all the obnoious things kids do to their beloved dogs!)  And ...<br>  3.  They are EXTREMELY PROTECTIVE of their human family and their home.  These dogs don't need to be trained to protect - they do it naturally, by instinct.<br>  Where to get one?  Check out the local Humane Society or dog pound, they often have German Shepherds.  They're great dogs!!   (See full description at website below.)   Good luck!|`|0m6BgESXaa	"Unless you train your dog in Schutzhund your dog will not fully gaurd your property."<br>  <br>  Actually, this sport is not about teaching a dog to guard properly, so even a schutzhund dog won't do the (foolish) OP any good.<br>  <br>  If you think spending a grand on a dog is a waste, then you don't need a good guard dog, because they don't come cheap.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you're a trolly troll troll that needs to go back under his bridge.<br>  <br>  You want your house protected, buy a security system and a gun.

I had a toy dachshund and was the meanest, loudest and toughest little guy on our block. So I don't think its necessarily the size or breed. Our little guy was so fearful, and insecure that he became like that. No matter what I tried to socialize him he never changed.

It's tough looking, a great watch dog, extremely loving and GREAT with kids. As long as you bring it up around your child the dog and baby should get along just fine. They are very very loyal to the family. There are a few amazing youtube videos of a rottweiler and baby and that is just some proof as to how good they are with kids.

My friend adopted a dog from the humane society in our area and he guards the house just fine. Why? Because he has a nice hearty bark. He's the biggest and sweetest dog you will ever meet, but when people come to the door and hear him bark, I always notice that people stand off to the side of the door and some people even ask my friend or I to put the dog away before they come inside. All you really need is a dog with nice, loud, intimidating bark.<br>  <br>  As long as you have a good bond with your dog, your dog will protect you if someone tries to attack you. Dogs are pretty smart that way - they know who strangers are and can sense if someone means to create any ill will.<br>  <br>  A lot of robbers or other criminals will steer clear of houses that they suspect have dogs. They never know what kind of dog you have in there and they sure as heck don't know how mean it is. Anybody who will break into your house regardless of who is inside is a nutcase and a guard dog won't make much of a difference.<br>  <br>  That being said, maybe a Lab or German Shepard (sp)? Maybe even a type of Hound? All three are large dogs (well, Hounds come in different breeds but there are some big breeds) and will be sweet to your family and company, but will undoubtedly protect you if need be. Go your local animal shelter and ask to see dogs that will grow up to be fairly large. Obviously, don't get a Chihuahua or another small dog, lol. <br>  <br>  Good luck. =o)|`|063f3r4laa	Dogs trained to be vicious, or even just a mean one, is a danger to your child and your neighbors.

And No good breeders sell mixes, so you will get it from a shelter, not knowing its past or if its really mixed with the breeds listed.<br>  <br>  If you have these special needs, Buy a dog, from a RESPONSIBLE and reputable breeder, instead of taking chances. <br>  Because trust me, it wont be a waste when you get a shelter dog and it attacks your baby because you don't know where it came from. (I'm not hating on shelter dogs, I have two and i love them very much, I only got two dogs in my life from a breeder, and that was because i had specific needs for the dog. And only certain breeds, bred from certain lines will fit that.)<br>  <br>  But, child friendly guard dogs are actually pit bulls (despite the medias feed. if you do research you will find they are VERY good dogs.)<br>  German shepherds<br>  doberman pinschers. <br>  etc.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Sorry, but spending 1000 on a well bred dog FAR SURPASSES spending 200 on a mutt who is riddled with health issues who ends up costing you much more in the long run.<br>  <br>  That being said-- no dog should be encouraged to be aggressive, but you can train your dog in schutzhund, but that requires paying a professional trainer.

No one should want a mean dog.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't trust that type of dog with your 1-year old, mostly.  There are dogs that look tough and can look scary, that are not mean.  <br>  <br>  Also, there are dogs that are "good dogs", but will also protect their owner/s.  This is what I would look for first rather than a "mean" dog.  <br>  <br>  Would you really want to chance that type of dog around your 1-year old?  Also, if not, where and how would you plan to keep your dog?  Outside?  Constantly?   Away from humans?  Chained up?  Noooooooo.....please don't.   Not only is it unfair to treat a dog like that, it's unfair to have a dog living in those type of arrangements.  <br>  <br>  Overall, that's inhumane.  I'd suggest a "security alarm" instead of abusing an innocent dog in this way.  <br>  <br>  Better to look for a dog that looks strong to hold his part, however, can be a family dog.....a trusting one around humans, and can still be loved and treated humanely.<br>  <br>  Additional..............you could be staking a chance and gambling on a future possible "law suit".   Not a good plan.|`|eDySIDPQaa	You want a big mean guard dog with a 1 yr old in the house, I don't think so....and you say it's a waste to get a pure bred, how so<br>  <br>  at least with a purebred, you know the temperament of the breed.<br>  <br>  and if you want it for only to be mean and aggressive, this is a huge mistake on your part...really it will only lead to problems, it always does when someone wants a dog to be mean and to be large<br>  <br>  You can get a good breed that is protective without aggression or being mean....<br>  <br>  I would suggest you step back and think this one over, what is more important my child or a mean guard dog...please don't take in a mean dog already, around your child.....you will regret it for life.....<br>  <br>  I really think if this is the only reason you want the dog, is not to get a dog at all...I think it will be thrown in the yard and forgotten except to water and feed it........and never walked, trained, or played with.<br>  <br>  Now on the otherhand if you want a protective dog for you and the family to love and have as a loyal companion and a part of the household, then yes it would be okay.....<br>  <br>  Purebreds, if gotten from shelter or reputable breeder are tested for temperaments,and they are safe to be around children then get it,.<br>  <br>  you can get mixes as well from shelters, this would give a poor dog a second chance at a good life, and is also tested by the shelters before they allow the dogs to be put up for adoption...<br>  <br>  so take the family to the shelter and pick out a good breed, and take it home for love, not to be mean and it will grow a loving bond with you and will become protective of the family naturally,,,,,it is a dogs instinct to protect, this comes naturally and does not need further pushing to become mean or aggressive..<br>  <br>  love, patience and caring for a dog is the best thing in the world a person can do, and no need to push the dog to be mean, they are protective of their humans anyway...and it's entiely on you to which breed dog to get, you have to research and pick the breed that best fits your lifestyle, not just a dog to put in the yard for a guard dog, think of your child first, then research the breeds,then find you a breed for you and your family, and since you are insistent on getting a mean guard dog, you best call your insurance company first and make sure you have plenty of home owners coverage, cause your gonna need it big time....attacks, bites, causing little  old ladies to have heart attacks, yep good insurance too...<br>  <br>  good luck...visit a shelter, I think you will be surprised at the Purebreds there and mixes as well, that will make a great additoin to your family..<br>  <br>  do it for love of a dog or not at all.......good luck|`|fOLO4TNhaa	A waste?

Move your finger around to make sure they follow it.  Snap your fingers to make sure they can hear okay.  Noses should be damp/wet -- a warm, dry nose could mean a fever or other illness.<br>  <br>  Check the mouth for sores or bad teeth or gunk on teeth such as tartar.  Smell the mouth and breath -- a fruity smell could mean diabetes, a really bad smell (other than tuna breath) could mean dental problems or stomach problems.  If they will let you, brush their teeth with water or appropriate pet toothpaste.<br>  <br>  You can run hour hands over their body, legs,  tail, and massage a little to feel for any lumps or bumps or any indication of pain or discomfort.   Look for mats of fur.<br>  <br>  You can check paws to make sure they aren't dry, and that the claws and pads look good.  Learn to trim claws properly (there are lots of instruction on YouTube).<br>  <br>  Blow on their fur to look for fleas or dry skin or a lot of dander.  A vet always combs through the fur with a flea comb to check for fleas, flea dirt/eggs and excessive dander.  Look for any bald or hairless spots.  Dry skin or chewing on themselves could be food allergies or not enough Omega 3 oils in the diet, so that is important to look out for.<br>  <br>  Feel the tummies -- a swelled belly could mean worms.<br>  <br>  Feel behind the belly to see if the bladder is okay -- a swelled area there could be a bladder or urinary infection.<br>  <br>  You can look at their poop to make sure it isn't too sloppy or  too hard.  Look at the poop and their butts for little "rice grains" which could mean tapeworms.<br>  <br>  You can weigh them regularly (weigh yourself, hold the cat/dog and weigh again -- the difference is their weight).

dCLnLlsCaa	Gosh I don't know why so many people are giving you a hard time.  It's like most people in this section value dogs more than humans!  Bottom line, if you decide to own an aggressive breed like a pit bull, german shepard, etc., then you need to take responsibility as an owner and take precautions!  I live in San Francisco and we've had a child die from a pit bull attack and a woman in an apartment building by an aggressive dog.  So I would call the Police dept. or a local animal control place and ask them if there is a height restriction for the fence (there should be).  Find out what it is and let them know, otherwise it's their *** on the line.  You shouldn't have to feel worried about your daughter playing in YOUR yard!!!!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Too bad if you're not happy to have a Pit Bull next door.  They pay the rent or the mortgage on their house so they can have whichever breed they like.  When you pay your neighbors rent then you can make the rules.<br>  <br>  How do you know their dog is mean and aggressive.  Dogs bark and growl when they are playing.  This doesn't make them nasty.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that the fence is not high enough and to keep your toddler safe, though Pit Bulls are usually wonderful with kids and humans, supervise your child out in the yard.  You should already being doing that anyway since you have a dog of your own.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could have a friendly word with your new neighbors and ask them about raising the height of the dividing fence.|`|xCSZ3M3Raa	What a lot of answers, but I will put my two cents in.  I have a pit and he is friendly but I wouldn't let any other dog around my child and a three foot fence might as well not be there, it would only keep a little dog in.   Watching your child may not be enough, because an attack can happen so fast you may not have time to react.  try to talk to the neighbors and find out about the dog, but I would still seek help about the fence  it is not adequate for any large dog.|`|VtHvcEtuaa	Say this dog was a Golden Retriever, would you have an issue?  I get the vibe you don't like the dog simply because it is a pit.<br>  <br>  If the barking bothers you that much, go to your new neighbors and say you are concerned.  You may find out that the dog is just territorial and it actually a nice dog.|`|bJh1MesQaa	I would check at your city hall. Ask them. I know you worry and pits are very scary looking and when they bite it is bad because they don't let go but give the pitbull some slack. They are not man eaters. They just got a bad reputation because people use them to fight. They are just being loyal. Ones that are not trained to fight are just good guard dogs. He wont get you if you don't enter his home. Don't worry to much! Good Luck!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	I'd contact the local police or humane officers to see what can be done- you have every right to protect your familhy|`|4SQx8smEaa	I am sorry but how do you know that the dog is aggressive??<br>  Because it is a pit bull??<br>  Well if that is the case i am going to have to break the news...pit bulls..despite what the media may make them out to be are actually wonderful and gentle family pets, that are less likely to bite then a cocker spaniel.<br>  <br>  And you say the dog is aggressive because it is barking. That is how dogs speak.<br>  Stop making accusations about this dog, until you find out first hand what the temperament of this certain dog is, why not go and introduce yourself to your new neighbors and get to know the dog.<br>  <br>  And I guess this would not be an issue if the dog on the other side of the fence was an "aggressive" Golden Retreiver?? Now would it?? close minded people...seriously?<br>  <br>  ADD: this is too Nicole......you are not an animal lover!! So Shut up!! If you loved animals, you wouldn't want to kill pitbulls. You are sick!!<br>  <br>  The dog has not jumped the fence yet, if it wanted to it could have jumped over and ate you up by now, but guess what it did not, you were not attacked. Now if this dog that you claim to be "aggressive: jumps over and comes after you then tou can do something about the dog. Did you ever stop to think, why the dog is barking at you or growling at you? Maybe he is being mistreated or abused.<br>  And all you are is concerned about "your right to enjoy your yard" well that does not take your neighbors right to enjoy their dog.<br>  <br>  There are many reason why a dog barks<br>  <br>  1) Boredom, frustration, loneliness - Is your pet left alone in the yard all day? <br>  2) Improper confinement - Is he locked in a room or crate for long periods? <br>  3) Pent up energy or lack of exercise. <br>  4) Environmental - Your pet dog may bark when other dogs bark, a phone rings, a mechanical noise starts up, a car passes your house, he hears strange voices or thunder. <br>  5) Territorial protection - Barking begins when strangers enter your property. <br>  6) An expression of some need such as food or attention. <br>  7) Separation anxiety <br>  8) When a family member returns home. <br>  <br>  There are many ways to deal with excessive barking and you will need to determine the best approach for your situation. <br>  <br>  Bored dogs bark. What exactly does he have to do outside? Barking at strangers can be a deeply ingrained pre-programed behavior so your puppy enjoys doing it. He won't stop unless you teach him how. <br>  <br>  If your dog is outside, bring him in, that is a surefire cure. <br>  <br>  Most dogs bark because they are lonely, bored or frightened. These are all situations that can be easily dealt with.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Well, first, give the dog a chance to settle in a bit.  Even my well trained, well behaved, friendly as can be Aussie was "off" for about a week when I moved.  It's all new and they have to get used to it a bit.<br>  <br>  Second, have you introduced yourself to the neighbor in a friendly way?  My goodness, go meet the people and, sure, voice your concern about the dog but don't be jerk about it.  If you go over with the attitude you have "omg, they have a pit, my babies gonna die!!" I'm sure you won't be well received.  But if you go over and say, "gee, big dog?  Is he friendly?"  You might actually get to learn something about the dog and your neighbors.<br>  <br>  I understand being a concerned parent, but there are ways of handing things without stirring up the pot.|`|EnwYxbS4aa	Stop going on at her that she is discriminating against pit bulls.<br>  <br>  I am a huge animal lover and am aware that pit bulls in the correct hands are lovely gentle dogs but in the wrong hands they are certainly more dangerous than a gentle lab so even I am wary with a strange pit bull.<br>  <br>  You will definitely have the right to get something done about him being able to jump into your garden as that would indicate they are not controlling their dog properly.  <br>  <br>  Something else to be aware of is if your neighbors have the poor dog locked outside all day and night and dont exercise him properly and dont have him indoors as part of the family - he is likely to become very bored which could lead to him getting agitated - but hopefully thats not the case and he is well cared for.<br>  <br>  You do most certainly have the right to be concerned and you most certainly have the right to ensure the dog cant get into your garden.  Good luck.|`|QnK3ESBdaa	Check to see if your county or city has an animal control authority. Where I live, animal control is who you contact about stuff like that. They have the authority to ticket the owner for the dogs excessive barking, and to look at the behavior of the dog to see if it's aggressive. In most cases, Pit Bulls are under trained, and poorly cared for, for the type of dog they are. Don't trust any dog for that matter, when it comes to your child. It's just that a Pit Bull is so powerful and when the attack, they naturally continue the attack unlike most dogs that will usually bite and run off.|`|zTeLhroWaa	Contact the police and complain about the excessive noise.  Too many noise violations and she'll have to get rid of the dog.<br>  <br>  You could also check into your local building codes and see if there are fencing requirements<br>  <br>  I'm not sure there's much else you can do at this point, it's your neighbor's property, not yours.  Just keep your kid and dog away from it...take your dog for frequent walks instead of letting it out in the yard, etc.  Make it work until you move.|`|O4M6BEDJaa	Is he outside all the time or just for potty breaks? If he is only out there for potty breaks I would just keep your dog and kid in the house while he is out there since you only have 4 more months to deal with it, but if he is out all the time I would look into the fence requirements for you city you should be able to find that out at your local court house.|`|BvJKu7cGaa	i have three pits and they are the sweetest dogs, not mean at all. yes they bark at people and other animals when they are outside but what dog doesnt? i agree, it seems like you have a problem just because he is a pit. its closeminded people like you who give the breed a bad name. go talk to your neighboor and see if there is something they could do to keep the peace between your dog and theirs. don't be so negative about it!|`|CCTsWXFbaa	How do you know the dog is mean & aggressive?<br>  More info please.<br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  Maybe the dog next door is being neglected & you should look into it.<br>  Dogs should not be chained up & left outside 24/7.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	and what if it was a Pomeranian doing this?  a lot of dogs bark and growl at people they don't know.  you shouldn't think it's "mean" just because it's a pit<br>  <br>  ADD:  how do you know he's aggressive just because he's growling?  you said they just moved there.  try talking to your neighbors about it, let them know you have a child...or you can build a bigger fence.  Keep an eye on your child, don't let them wonder outside alone.<br>  ADD:  you can't always blame the dogs for aggressiveness...the owners are always to blame.  dogs that are raised right don't act that way.  My dogs bark and growl at people they don't know, but they don't bite or anything.  If they person they don't know starts walking towards them, they back off.  It's their way of letting those people know they don't know them and not to try anything funny.  After about 10 minutes, they are fine, they don't bark anymore.<br>  Like i said before, just because the dog barks and growls doesn't mean it's going to "attack" you.  All dogs do that at some point.  and again, try talking to these new neighbors.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Just make sure that you never leave your child outside alone, and try to keep an eye open each time your dog goes outside.  If he does jump the fence and actually attack your dog(shouldn't go after your baby), then get either a stick or a water hose to try to seperate them. Don't ever use your hands or other body parts to seperate a dog fight!!  You will be bitten accidentally by either dog, and nobody wants that.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you can't really have anything done about it as far as the law goes.  He has to be proclaimed a "dangerous dog" by law, and it sounds like that will only happen after he attacks you or your dog.<br>  <a href="http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stuswast16_08_040.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animallaw.info/statutes/stusw...</a><br>  <br>  Here in Texas I can shoot any dog that I consider dangerous if he enters my property.  I don't even have to wait for the dog to actually attack something..he just has to be actively "threatening" me or my animals (haha).|`|3z3P6j49aa	How do you know the dog is aggressive? Most dogs bark and growl (hello, guard dog?)<br>  <br>  You have NO proof the dog is mean, just because it looks huge and its a pit bull. <br>  I suggest you talk to your neighbor about it.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have to worry about it, if you don't leave your baby unsupervised anyways.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	You would need to find out if your city has an ordinance laws in regards to Pit Bulls or breeds that are consider “dangerous” Or if they require fences to be a certain height for anyone who has a dog. You might call animal control to come out to your home and observe the dog, they could have more insight. . Other then those things there is really not much you can do.|`|AA11426077	i totally understand your predicament. and its not your fault there is a careless neighbor next door who didn't give the dog the training and care it deserved which led it to become aggressive. such a shame. but anyhow, i would contact your local city office. ours has a number we can call to complain about these things. also animal control may be able to get involved, im not sure. id just make some phone calls. i have a half pit/lab mix and she is the sweetest thing and i would be offended if someone said all pits are aggressive, but the hard thing is there are some bad dog owners in the world who bring some of these poor dogs up for the wrong reasons (dog fights etc) and its just a horrible shame because they're a great breed with a bad rap. but anyway sorry for your predicament. if i were you, id stick up a chicken wire fence on your side (the tallest fence/fence substitute you can find). these people really are stupid for letting their dog, which is now a law suit waiting to happen, in a 3ft fence back yard. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|26PPwzrWaa	No. You are wrong about it. Read up on BSL. <br>  <br>  The dog didnt turn, the dog warned before biting. Just owners that didnt know dog behavior. My lab bit me and it was because I was being rude. She gave me fair warning to back off. <br>  <br>  I dont want any dog in my yard so I understand your point, but leave the breed out. Can you really identify an american pit bull terrier?<br>  Lets see: <a href="http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/findpit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/...</a><br>  <br>  It is the owners that have allowed the dog to become that way. And if you see the dog in your yard, call animal control.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	We have no idea what country, city, or state you live in to know your aggressive dog laws.<br>  <br>  Your toddler should not be outside playing unattended as is, so you should be fine.  And if you go on a walk, walk the OTHER way of the yard.
oMmBhWK4aa	A lot depends on the kind of plants you already have or intend to plant. The sole reason for a nutrient rich substrate is to benefit those plants that take in most or all of their nutrient requirement through their roots. Hence their roots are far more extensive than other plants and you usually plant them where the substrate is deeper ie. as background plants. <br>  <br>  The ideal way is to already add a layer of nutrient rich substrate below your top gravel layer when setting up a new tank. For an existing setup, you can get substrate fertiliser tablets or sticks. Follow the instructions to push in one stick per defined area, near but not too close to any plant's base. Don't be tempted to use more sticks or do it more frequently (usually between 3-6 months interval). Cover up the holes you made with gravel to prevent excessive fertiliser leaking into the water. <br>  <br>  Substrate fertilisation is long term in purpose, especially to provide a constant long term supply of iron which particularly benefits red-leaved plants. You still need short term fertilisation, which is the use of liquid fertilisers to be added to the water column, usually on a weekly basis. Again you need to follow the manufacturer's instructions to the letter, or you'll end up with way too much algae. For beginners, stick to the all-in-one solutions like Seachem's Flourish. As you get more experienced, you can try the individual element fertilisers. <br>  <br>  If you have inverts (eg. shrimps, snails, lobsters etc) in your tank, avoid stuff that contain copper. You may also need to reduce doses if your scaleless fish are affected eg. corydoras, loaches.  <br>  <br>  Getting plants to grow well is a multi-factor equation and fertilisation is only one factor. And all factors must be balanced well. The other important considerations are the amount of tank lighting and amount of CO2. One of the best visual rewards of getting things right is the sight of countless small pearls of oxygen forming on your plant leaves when the plants undergo photosynthesis.<br>  <br>  If all these is getting to be too much hassle, then stick with undemanding plants like mosses, Java fern or anubias which are tied to driftwood or rocks instead of being planted into the substrate. You can have a very effective display just using various mosses: have a moss wall as background, moss tied to a tall structure soon creates a green mountain, moss trapped under plastic mesh on the tank bottom will soon grow through the gaps as a really cool ground cover (looks like a wide plain of tall wavy grass).<br>  <br>  The main thing with plants is have patience, do lots of research and be diligent in tank maintenance. Have fun!|`|nbtVuFVNaa	without the substrate it will take longer..if u already have a tank set up with fishes id saay dont bother adding more substrate...if it has no fishes ya its better the kind u want is commonly known as first layer its made of river clay adn u kite want to boost the co2..have fun:D|`|YnCUyvK7aa	Some plants could grow without any special substrate, but how well they'd grow will depend on how much nutrients were in the tank initially.  There's some nitrate that might be in your tapwater, plus you have the wastes from your fish.  But some plants need higher amounts of iron, and that's where having a fertilizer or plant substrate can help.<br>  <br>  Before you tear up your entire tank, though, you might want to try some easier plants like Crypts that you can root in just gravel, and buying some of the aquarium plant fertilizers that come in tablet form like this.  <a href="http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/prod/236403/product.web" rel="nofollow">http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/prod/236...</a>  You just push the tablet down into the gravel near where the roots of the plant are.  But I wouldn't use a full pellet, maybe just a quarter of 1, this keeps a lower level of nutrients so it's not as likely that you'll have a problem with algae, which also uses the fertilizer.<br>  <br>  And the growth of the plants depends as much on the kind and amount of lighting you have, not just fertilizer.  If your lighting isn't good for the kinds of plants you have, adding more fertilizer won't make a difference.|`|aeonmRR2aa	Don't put solid fertilizer in your substrate!  EVER!  You will wish you had never heard of the idea when you rip out everything, do a 100% water replacement, and replace the substrate, just to get rid of the fertilizer that is causing algae blooms and killing all your fish.  Fertilizer should be added as needed, in liquid form.<br>  <br>  You can put in extra substrate if you want.  To do so, remove all of your ornaments/rocks/driftwood, then use a siphon hose to suck all the gravel into a bucket (dumping the water back in as needed).  It is best to take the fishies out while doing this.<br>  <br>  Then add the new substrate...  smooth it out...  and add the old gravel on top...  then put back in the decorations, then the fish.  Be very sure to rinse new substrate well or it will cloud the tank (unless you are using something inherently cloudy, like clay).<br>  <br>  Peat and perlite or zeolite on the bottom, then expanded clay (such as Lesco Soilmaster, etc), might be a good idea.<br>  <br>  You do not NEED a special substrate for plants - you need a lot of light!  Minimum for low-light plants is around 1.5 watts per gallon, with 3 watts per gallon allowing you to grow most plants.  Normal 1-tube tank hoods provide about 1W/gallon or less!<br>  <br>  This is a good plant site:<br>  <a href="http://www.plantedtank.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantedtank.net/</a><br>  <br>  P.S.  Java moss is one of the easiest plants to grow, and can grow in low light.  It does not need special soil because it does not grow in soil; you attach it to rocks or wood.

I would have loved to see Dusty claw that kid and then get away, out of the house somewhere where that piece of sh*t couldn't find him. I don't know what is going on with people today, we are supposed to be intelligent and we place ourselves above the animals, it isn't very intelligent to go around abusing animals, we are supposed to be their caretakers and I wish that anyone who abused an animal or a child would have the same thing done to them that they did to the animal or child.

qqUvoC5uaa	What makes a Biewer Yorkie is a recessive gene called Piebald. This occurred in 1986. <br>  <br>  Today Yorkshire Terriers and Biewers are considered two different breeds. They are recognized by American Rare Breed Association(ARBA) <br>  <br>  The reason they are so expensive is because they are recognized as a separate breed, and are relatively rare because of it. A true Biewer is typically only bred by people who can be seen as reputable breeders. With good breeding and rarity, you are typically going to have a more expensive dog.<br>  <br>  Also, according to this website <a href="http://www.petyourdog.com/hybrid_designer_dog/b/biewer_yorkie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.petyourdog.com/hybrid_designe...</a> a biewer yorkie is a "designer" mutt with a "Biewer" and a Yorkshire Terrier mixed. This information is false. Especially when the "Biewer" link takes you to the Bichon Frise page.<br>  <br>  Add: <br>  Something you might want to know is that in North America, nearly all "Biewers" are mixed with regular Yorkshire Terriers, so paying a ridiculous price for one in NA would "technically" give you an extremely overpriced mutt. If you consider them to be a separate breed.|`|XagPxe7Faa	They are expensive because at this point, they are extremely rare.  The variation of the breed originated in Germany in the early 80's.  Most of the original Biewer lines are still there and have to be imported by breeders to the US.  Many breeders visit Germany to work with those who have been involved with the dogs for many years to learn the ins and outs.  Also, reputable breeders are going above and beyond to perform excessive health screenings--more so than the standard Yorkie--on the dogs to ensure that there are no health issues affecting specifically the Biewers.<br>  These types of things costs money...LOTS of money.<br>  <br>  Biewers should not be confused with the Parti Yorkie.  Biewers originated from the piebald gene presenting itself in offspring produced by two standard colored YT's.  The dogs were selectively bred unti they Piebald was presenting itself in other lines.  Presently, there is a set standard for the dogs regarding proper color placement and all Biewers *should* trace back to the original W. Biewer line.  (Biewer was the last name of the breeder who first produced/bred them.)<br>  <br>  Of course at this point the AKC does not recognize them....AMERICAN Kennel Club...until recently, Biewers were mostly found only in Europe.  Will they ever recognize them, as a separate breed or variation of the YT?  Who knows, only time will tell.<br>  There are several established breed clubs here in the US for Biewer...all with a separate set of guidelines and opinions on the dogs and their origins.  It can be very confusing!  Some organizations have already accepted the Biewers as a breed/variation and allow the dogs to compete in conformation events.<br>  <br>  Of course, given the growing popularity of Biewers (and Partis for that matter) based on their "rarity", you have many dishonest people breeding YT's with other breeds, mimicking the colors and claiming them to be Biewers. :(<br>  <br>  (Being that Biewers came from two standard YTs, how would breeding a Biewer to a standard YT make it a mutt?)|`|6SeWCfUfaa	And the kicker here .. AKC wouldn't consider them Yorkies, nor would the parent club.  They frown on this in a really big way.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think they're cute.  My only concern with them is that usually when a parent club issues a disqualification for coloration, there is a health reason behind it.  I don't happen to know what it would be in this case, but you might find more information about that at the yorkie parent club site.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ytca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ytca.org/</a>|`|q0vKbocHaa	Biewer Yorkies can be considered a seperate breed, and a rare one at that.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Sorry, no vet or trainer will tell you your dog is inbred.  There is no way any vet or trainer can know that. (BTW it's inbred not bread- bread is food).<br>  <br>  The only way to know about your dog's breeding is to view the pedigree papers, which it seems you don't have, and trace the lines on both sides of the pedigree.  <br>  If you have no pedigree papers then you cannot be sure your dog is a pure bred dog.  You can have an educated guess going by the appearance of the dog.<br>  <br>  The best way to prevent your dog from chewing on your clothes is to put your clothes away where the dog can't get them.  Dirty clothes go in the laundry basket and clean clothes in the cupboard.<br>  <br>  Not all dogs like to play ball.  One of my Cavaliers does and the other one is not at all interested.<br>  <br>  Add: in reply to your added information.  If you have his pedigree papers then you know exactly when he was born so why would you need the vet to estimate his age?  <br>  You would also know the precise details of any inbreeding so it wouldn't be just 'something with his grandma'.   There is line breeding and there is inbreeding.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	When a vet estimates a dog's age, he's doing just that.....estimating. Your dog could be any age really, as your vet is just going on how old the dog looks.....<br>  As for being inbred, there's no way a vet or a trainer could know that unless you had the dog's pedigree papers with you. <br>  It sounds like your dog just needs training.....he's a normal dog that likes to chew on clothes. All dogs chew on things they shouldn't unless they are trained not to.<br>  <br>  Edit: Inbreeding does NOT necessarily = hard to train. If a trainer told you this, the trainer is an idiot. It sounds like the trainer was looking for an excuse for having no clue what to tell you.|`|dPmrCpv8aa	Just like people, dog's have preferences. If he is not interested in playing with the toys, and he prefers clothes, get an old t shirt and tie a knot in it and give it to him. Let him know that only the shirts with knots in them are okay to play with. This way, he is able to have his fun, and won't tear up your clothes!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Your trainer told you that your dog wanting to play with your clothes and not his toys is the result of inbreeding?  If that's the case, get a new trainer.<br>  <br>  Dogs like stuff that smells like you better than stuff that doesn't smell like you.  They'll also go for stuff that will get a reaction out of you because, hey, they want your attention.<br>  <br>  The way to get them playing with their toys is to make getting your stuff harder, put your ditry clothes in a laundry basket or behind closed doors, make their toys more fun by playing with the dog and the toys and by not giving chase when they happen to get something of yours that you don't want them to have.  That's a game to them, it's fun.  If you chase them, they'll keep stealing it so you'll play.<br>  <br>  Next, take your dog for lots of walks.  Papillons are active little dogs and love to be busy.  So lots of walks.  Take the dog to obedience training.  Papillons are actually smart, if you have someone show you how to properly train your dog, it will probably learn very fast.  And then ... get involved with more training.  Flyball, obedience, agility, even frisbee are things Pap's EXELL at.  They really are incredibly fun and trainable little dogs.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|BvJKu7cGaa	maybe try taking him outside and bringing all his toys out there so that there wont be anything else around for him to play with. and you could throw it or run with it and get him to chase you, show him that its a game. then when he starts playing with them take them inside and then have some clothes out too, and whenever you catch him chewing or playing with clothes, correct him and point him towards his toys and praise him when he plays with them so he will know what is acceptable for him to chew on. just cause he's been imbred don't mean hes too dumb to learn, it just takes time and patience on your part. I hope it works out for you, good luck!
IbDcAXsaaa	Rat cage. Glass tanks can cause so many problems! First, the pneumonia from their urine can really make the rats sick, and give them respiratory problems, which would cost you way more than 100 dollars like your friend paid for the tank.<br>  <br>  Rat cages are first of all designed for rats. They can't squeeze through the bars, they can't chew through, and its very open and easy for fresh air to enter. I have the Rat Manor at my house, its about three feet tall with a lot of levels, and rats love to climb, which tanks don't give them a lot of that option. They love wheels, and they love having a lot of space. So I would research it more, and get a cage that's meant for rats. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Ps: If I were you, I wouldn't keep them in the current cage they're in, it doesn't seem sanitary.

Hyphenated names are very popular in France. They are usually composed of two names from the same gender; i.e., Jean-Pierre, Paul-Henri, Anne-Laure, or Marie-élise. Less commonly, they are composed of one boy name and one girl name, with the "correct" gender name first, as in Jean-Marie for a boy or Marie-Jacques for a girl.

There are Silkies which have feathers that look and feel like fur.  I call those chickie bunnies. LOL Little banties aren't any messier than a parrot.  They are so friendly.  Mine will jump into my lap, and they love to just sit in my lap like a cat, and be petted and cuddled.  They even make purring noises.  They sing, too.  And you even get eggs to eat.  The good thing about them is that, if you have to be away for a few days, you can just leave plenty of food and water in their cage, and they will do okay.|`|WcsYK6sYaa	1. guniea pigs. i have a hamster and i think here the best pet ever. and a guniea pig is close to a hamster so i would get a guniea pig or a hamster. Fish are boring and birds can be fun be can fly away. Rabbits are good tho and thats my second choice.|`|ocLPEMsZaa	Fish, easier to maintain. Guinea pigs, bird and rabbits all require special attention. I have a leopard gecko and he's super easy to take care of.

a7xUvhqpaa	Oh they must have broke off the leash again. God...ugh...damn it. Hang on i'll be right there!|`|6f8ZKDJ4aa	I bet frogs must have came from a creek or whatever but then they jsut wandered into your house and had family's there. Probably just a quidcinense.|`|HyBcKAf7aa	they came from elsewhere and made their "kids" lol in your backyard but frogs is cute :) you're lucky|`|McnuekTBaa	I don't know where you are, but the rain has brought them out of hibernation or estivation.<br>  Rain stimulates breeding and other activity, which explains why you are suddenly seeing so many of them. They were nearby all along.|`|cb8FYxpuaa	they came from the creek?|`|jJ9JGCNTaa	yeah i agree|`|GfbCNhQnaa	Wow! okay, that sounds like what happened to me when we left our pool *unattended* and over 200 frogs were found living in it!!!! we had no idea where they came from because we live near a forest. There maybe were frog eggs carried on a bird that went by there and they hatched and developed because of all the rain, but I'm not sure.|`|qToGM6J8aa	They are probably cuban tree frogs There eggs are dropped by birds or blow in the wind. They turn into tadpoles the develope into frogs.|`|VemHKmkmaa	the frog emporer sent them.|`|VhdbVUniaa	they probabaly came from any  damp area such as a creek, depending on what type though.|`|Ek92oEelaa	well....  when a mommy frog and a daddy frog love eachother very much.....|`|rTV5W9L2aa	tadpoles|`|kg4kQz0aaa	they hopped there?
6sTsDvKmaa	The easiest way would be to get some really good wet dog food or plain ground meat and and mix it in really well.  Don't just put the liquid on top.  Also, orange juice masks the smell of some liquids, and dogs usually like it.  (How I got my dog to drink hydrogen peroxide when he got into a lot of valentine's chocolate).<br>  <br>  If that really doesn't work, the easiest way is to get a syringe and squirt the liquid into the corner of their mouth.  Some dogs can spit it out though, so hold his nose shut and blow lightly on his nose until he swallows. <br>  <br>  If THAT doesn't work, then ask the vet if there is a pill form of the medicine, which should be easier to give.  And less messy|`|jBOHWOBtaa	lol<br>  !I ad to give my dog her medacine. Everytime I called her with the bottle, she'll run away!<br>  But anyways, the way I gave the medecine to my pup is by opening her mouth and just squirt it in. If it's the pill you are worried about, hide it into your dog's food, they might notice the flavor, but they'll already have it in thwi tummies!<br>  Another trick is to get one of the dog's favorite doggie treats and hide it there. I think there is this new type of dog treat that has a small hole so you can stick the pill in. I'm not sure what they are called, but I hear it is a great way to trick your dog to eating its medacine!|`|urHsorvyaa	ah hah!!! i know just what to do!!! mix the medicine with chicken gravy and pour it over their dog food. they wont smell the medicine in the gravy and it will all taste good to him! =]|`|d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	You don't have to actually open his mouth to get the medication in.  Try slipping the syringe into the pouch between his cheek & teeth, then depress the plunger (or squeeze the bulb, whichever you have).  Follow it up with a treat that you *know* he won't turn down.  Hopefully he won't just drool it out.  They will usually swallow with this method.<br>  <br>  Good luck & hope this works.|`|jAZ8UruEaa	feel around the "hinge" of his jaw. squeeze around that area and you'll find a little spot where, if you squeeze, he will have to open his mouth. then put it in the back of his throat and hold his mouth closed for a second so he swallows. or you could always try mixing it in some sort of soft food.|`|4IZHdhJQaa	A syringe with no needle on the end always works for me, slide it into the side of their mouth and squirt it in, my dogs hate taking meds too!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and i hope your dog gets better quick!|`|OrvTG44laa	If he really won't take it, and it is necessary, ask the vet to give him a shot.|`|tp99oNxuaa	open his/her mouth and pour it in ! idk|`|JsBb732Maa	Get a syringe and put the amount of medicine in it, take the dog by the muzzle about half way back and put your fingers between his teeth and he should open his mouth. Put the syringe in and quickly push it to put the liquid in. Hold his jaw closed until you feel him swallow.|`|SpIlb43Uaa	Get a baby/children's type of syringe to give the medicine in. You can get one from your vet or buy at a drug store.Close the dogs muzzle (mouth) shut and put the syringe near the back of the lip area and squirt the medicine in and hold mouth shut until the dog swallows.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Get a syringe from the vet and use it to inject the liquid into his mouth.  It's very very easy and you can shoot the medication to the back of his throat where he will swallow it, with hardly any  of it escaping.  You place the syringe along the side of his mouth as far back as possible and then just push the plunger.   I do this all the time with liquids my dog need to take.|`|5PsKGss7aa	We have, an injection sort of thing for liquid (you can acquire at your vet) For our dogs we just had to open the mouth fast, in the beginning we had to catch them off guard,and then we shot the dosage in.<br>  We then give a little treat after.|`|AA10265922	sorry,all have the same problem,just get used to it,but you are not going to fool the dog,a little syrince and use that,it might work if you are lucky|`|GaL66jbQaa	open his mouth and pour it as far in the back of his mouth as possible then give him a really yummy yummy treat
pVwyu6Fuaa	The fish keep dying because they are carrying a disease.<br>  Please do not buy any of these fish, because of a few reasons...<br>  <br>  Fish spread diseases through their gills,<br>  which infects the tank water,<br>  which infects all other fish,<br>  you bring them home, and they infect your fish too...<br>  <br>  You may buy a few fish from walmart to save them, but you could be doing yourself a dis-service by infecting your other fish that you may have. <br>  Never ever buy fish from a place that has dead or dying fish in the tanks... you are just asking for a world of trouble if you do.<br>  Go and get yourself some healthy fish, I bet you will treat them better than anyone else!!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AraBfesHaa	Well, that's not entirely true.  I have some fish I bought at walmart and are still alive after 4 years.  My son has had some for 6 years he got there.<br>  Do you have a heater, filter and air pump to go with the tank?  You'll need those, plus dechlorinator.  Or better yet, get an ammonia neutralizer that ALSO neutralizes chlorine and chloramines.  You'll be one step ahead if you get that.  That will take care of about $50 or so, maybe less for a ten gallon tank.  You'll also need a fish net.<br>  You should also have some type of ammonia tester.  You can get one at petsmart (maybe even walmart, I'm not sure) that has a suction cup on the back side and you just attach it to the wall of the tank.  It will change colors when the ammonia level is elevated, in which case, you should do a partial water change (don't forget to dechlorinate) or add ammonia neutralizer.  This is likely to happen if you add more than 1 or 2 fish at a time.<br>  Then choose the healthiest looking you can find.  Don't get goldfish, they need a larger tank, at least 30 gallons.  Dont get a pleco (plecostomus), they need at least a 55 gallon tank.  Tetras would be a good choice.  They like to be in schools of about 6.<br>  If you choose mollies, guppies, or platys, make sure you ONLY get males.  They multiply like crazy and will overcrowd your tank in a month, the ammonia levels will rise, and you risk losing all of the fish in the tank.<br>  I, for one, admire you.  I would do the same thing.  But on the other hand, don't blame yourself if they don't make it.  They could have been ill already, but not necessarily just because they came from walmart.<br>  Don't forget to let their bag float in the tank for awhile, maybe 20-30 minutes so the water temperature is the same in the bag as in the tank before you take them out of the bag.  If you don't, the shock of different temperatures can kill them in a short period of time, and in the least, stress them and cause them to become diseased.<br>  If you need any more information, feel free to email me and ask anything you want.  :)<br>  Good luck!|`|4J2dhd4paa	If you mean that you have a 10 gallon, then look for the most healthy tank there is of tetras, because there schooling fish. Then just buy like 10-12 of them and they should live a really happy life. Also if you do have 100$ and no tank, then I would buy a 15 Gallon tank with a heater and filter. It should come with it. And buy 10 of a type of tetra especially if the neons or cardinals are there.|`|nVZTGC23aa	It is not your job to save these fish, if you are really concerned you can contact the ASPCA. Here is the website link [ <a href="http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/report-animal-cruelty.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelt...</a> ] or Contact the Animal Humane Society [ <a href="http://www.animalhumanesociety.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalhumanesociety.org/</a> ] Their main goal is to save animals lives. You have a good heart tying to save these poor fish but you shouldn't feel overwhelmed or forced to buy the fish. Having a fish should be for a fun learning experience and takes a lot of responsibility. Have a talk with your parents before you do anything, and truthfully if you do buy a fish from Wal-Mart they usually die within a couple of weeks due to previous experiences of "shock" or "stress".|`|vPLSSIj7aa	Fish are fish, they are going to die sooner or later.  But if you want to save as many as you can, I would get as many COMMUNITY fish as you can.  Make sure that all the fish you get are community fish because some fish don't get along well with others.  Also, make sure you have a big enough tank for however many fish you want to get.|`|6gB6AAoyaa	well i would but the ones that look most healthy because they will be the easy est to save but don't get too many fish that will be over crowing
AA10270018	I recommend a 55 gallons. You should always remember bigger is always better when looking for an aquarium.|`|tShDXmgbaa	I have successfully bred a pair in a 10 gallon tank. These guys are very profolic breeders and oh soo cute! especially the albino long fin ones.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	I believe that the smallest recommended tank for a Bristlenose Pleco is a 29 gallon. The person who said it will outgrow a tank this size is thinking of Common Plecos which get huge. The type you are asking about get 5-6" and can easily stay in the smaller sized aquariums.|`|iLpyQSX5aa	Bristlenose plecos do not get as large as there common cousins. Most don't grow over 6". A 20 gallon tank would be fine for a pair and should keep it pretty clean. Bigger is always better though for tank size.

426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	The unfed flea is able to live for months without a blood meal.  If there is no dog or cat in the house, you'll be the new meal ticket.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They spend only 20% of their time on the host.  They can live at least a couple of months between blood meals.|`|5uLDqE0maa	Fleas themselves need a blood meal to survive. But they lay eggs on their host, which are dropped into the environment. The last developmental stage before the adult stage (pupae) can lay dormant for almost a year. It is stimulated to hatch when there is a change in temperature, carbon dioxide levels, or vibration. This is why people notice that fleas jump on them when they enter an abandoned house. They are actually pupae that have hatched in response to the environmental change.|`|YV1bOajXaa	I'm not sure.  I know they can live a while.  We went away on vacation and when we came back, our bedroom rug had fleas in it and we didn't know it.  Our dog had fleas and we didn't know it, so we let him in our room and they infested our rug.  We walked in the room after two weeks being away and they pounced on us!   We had fleas crawling up our socks and biting us!  Yuck!   So we went and bought a flea bomb and set it off in our bedroom.  No more fleas.  The dog took a little longer to get rid of the fleas, but we didn't let him back on our rug until he was completely flea free.<br>  <br>  Good luck if you have them.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	When they become adults and are looking for their first blood-meal, they can only survive about a week without a host.<br>  But fleas can live a surprisingly long time between hosts (meals), weeks to even months.|`|dwx5uKgbaa	well that depends on if their biting you. if their not then they should die soon. they have to have some sort of blood supply to live
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	If I were you I would look at the shelter, lots of "aggressive breeds" don't get adopted because so many people are scared of them, however if you don't do that look through the classifieds and call different people and look at where they were bred, if the enviroment was clean, how the parents look and if they come with their shots or not, good luck finding your puppy!|`|44kEtDvIaa	Check site below.

uTIgyCCHaa	Your friends are absolutely right; that's exactly how a boxer SHOULD look.  Your guy is only 8 months old; he's just in his "teen" phase.  He's probably just past his biggest growth spurt, but he will continue to fill out and grow just a bit more over the next year and a half or so.  I wouldn't worry about it at all... In fact, especially at his age, I would be a little alarmed if you could NOT see his ribs.<br>  <br>  The boxer is a lean breed, more like a greyhound than, say, a labrador.  You should be able to see the last few ribs viewing from the side when the dog is *standing normally*.  That's what a full grown, ADULT boxer should look like, and a puppy or "teenage" boxer will show even more ribs.  In addition, 80% of pet dogs in the US are overweight, so the "healthy" physique we're so used to seeing probably isn't so healthy after all; it's just that we're used to it.  And yes, most people who don't know boxers, see a healthy one and think it is underfed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, 54 lbs is a fine weight for an 8 month old male.  The breed standard calls for males to be between 60-70 lbs, and I assure you that your guy will be on the higher end of that once he's full grown.  I'm sure you've seen much larger boxers, and so have I, but I've seen much smaller ones as well.  I have an 8 yr old female who weighs 52 lbs (though she should be closer to 49) and a nearly 2 yr old female weighing 65 lbs.  Most people see my younger girl and comment on how enormous she is.<br>  <br>  This is a VERY common concern among boxer puppy owners, because they ARE so skinny as youngsters ;)  but he will fill out with time.  The important thing is not to push it.  Health-wise, an underweight dog is far better than an overweight dog.  Overfeeding might not make any difference now while he's young, but it will take its toll in the long run.|`|AcxGPyG5aa	You might have got the runt of the litter  they grow differently.|`|E5fkULfYaa	I went through the same thing with my boxer when she was 7-9 mos. She didn't gain any weight in that time period but did grow 2 inches in her height. She looked thin and lanky with LOOOOONG legs. I took her the vet and they said it was perfectly normal for larger breed dogs that continue growing until 2 years of age to not grow perfectly in proportion. 53.8 lbs seems pretty average for an 8mo boxer. Mine is 14 mos. as of a couple days ago and she was just at the vet and weighs 60.3 lbs. <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned since you're feeding the correct amount of a healthy food and exercising regularly but if you're still worried a trip to the vet wouldn't hurt. :)|`|f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	Well, if he is just skinny (visible ribcage & hip bones) I would increase his food.  I feed my dogs to match an ideal body type not a fixed amount.  So if I am seeing ribs or backbone on a dog, I up the food.  I also suppliment with people food, wholesome food not junk.  Eggs, low fat cottage cheese, boiled chicken, rice, mashed potatoes (easy on the salt & butter here), carrots, peas.  The addition of a dog multi vitamin never hurts.<br>  <br>  I do a lot of rescue work and find a lot of starved or skinny dogs.  The addition of some mashed potatoes really can add some bulk to a puny looking dog.  And dogs love them.  <br>  <br>  Worms should not be an issue as most monthly heartworm also takes care of some of the other worms.<br>  <br>  As to overall size, that is another issue.  Boxers vary wildly in size and ideal weight.   I have seen full grown male boxers anywhere from 50-100 lbs.  Final size is genetic, assuming there was no starvation as a pup.  But, if you are concerned and additional food doesn't yield visible results consult your vet.|`|SnuWcziSaa	I actually have an 8 month old female boxer, and I was wondering the same thing. She is about 45 lbs right now. She gets lots of excercise, and is welcome to all the food she wants. I wouldn't really worry about it as long as the vet says he's healthy! Puppies don't normally stop growing until after they're a year old anyway. =) Who knows, maybe he was a runt like my lil furball!|`|JsBb732Maa	He could be going through a growth spurt, they look out of sorts then, leggy, big head etc. Look at a large breed puppy and see if the fat content is different and maybe change his food.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Your dog will continue to grow until he is 2 years of age.  Stop worrying about him as this is normal for the large breed dogs.  Here is an article I found when I thought my dog was too thin also.  After having my vet do extensive tests on him just to find out that he was healthy and happy, I stopped worrying about how thin he looked.  He has now (at 2 years of age) filled out beautifully and weighs 80 lbs. He is a german shepherd/malamute mix.  This article may help you determine if your dog really is underweight.<br>  <br>  How do you tell if your dog is too fat or too thin?<br>  First, look at them from above - you should be able to see a "waist" between the ribcage and the hips. Now look from the side. Dogs should have a "tuck up" in their lower abdomen. In the pictures the top dog appears to be in good condition, the bottom dog is too heavy. <br>  <br>  Protruding ribs or hip bones indicate a dog who is too thin. <br>  <br>  Now lightly rest your hands, fingertips together, over your dog's ribcage on either side of his body and move your hands back and forth (head to tail and back) a couple times - you should be able to feel his rib cage under a thin layer of padding, without probing for it. Do the same test on his back at the base of his tail - the pelvis shouldn't protrude sharply but you should be able to feel it. <br>  <br>  Overweight and underweight dogs are both at greater risk for health problems - if you think your dog may be too fat or too thin, consult with your veterinarian.
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You question is a bit confusing.  If the lump is between the ribs in the centre of the rib cage in the top part of the stomach, it is probably an umbilical hernia.<br>  <br>  If it is between two of the ribs on one side of the body then best you take the dog to the vet. <br>  <br>  You don't say how old the dog is or how long the lump has been there or if it is increasing in size.  This information would be helpful to us as would be information on the exact location of the lump.|`|AA11887983	It could be anything.

If you look at a month old corn snake that grows fast, and a month old corn snake that is growing slowly, then you cant say that one is older just beause it is bigger!:P<br>  Ja-maken me blush<3 ( my horses show name!!!!!!!)|`|xUNwC1B8aa	Yes and No.<br>  <br>  Yes if you know what it has been eating, how much it has been eating and how often but it is not a full accurate way to tell the age.  <br>  <br>  No because some people power feed snakes to get them to size (not a good thing to do) that they want quickly for things like breeding and some feed the snakes what they should get regularly and the snakes eat well but can still grow a bit differently than another in the same environment and eating patterns.  And some starve the animals like some pet suppliers so they cut back on the cost of the animal that they are "just going to sell and be rid of."|`|9yXp7ap8aa	You can have a general idea as long as you know what the snake is eating, but not the exact age. I would say that your ball python is probably about 5 months old or around that age.|`|tDUXX7T6aa	Not neccessarily, a snake can be quite large and quite a bit younger than another of smaller sixe. It's based mainly on there diet. If they were fed large quantities grequently than they will grow quickly, and if tey arent fed often they wont grow nearly as fast.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	all snakes grow at a rate determined buy amount and frequency they eat.it is probably a little less than a year old|`|l5VmMNN0aa	I doubt that is easy.Figure this,if you put a python in a small cage and feed it rarely,it will not grow very long and big.If on the other hand you put it in a big cage and feed it more,it grows exponentially.|`|mWZd0dKRaa	Yes
AA10270018	Soon the jack dempsey will grow bigger and beat the convict up. You can only stop the fighting momentarily by rearranging. What you can do is add more fishes. The fighting will stop when they are crowded like in the pet shop, just make sure that you have strong filtration system when you overstock.|`|3McbgQy7aa	No this will not help because I have had convicts and jack dempsey's in the same tank for about a year and they never will get alon. It seems to be in their nature. I've tried moving things around to but all it does is make the environment more stress full for the fish.<br>  <br>                           Hope this helps|`|tDUXX7T6aa	South American cichlid's are aggressive by nature, there is no guaantee that the fighting will stop.

P9byozx9aa	OMG all the stuff your doing with your rabbit is safe even newspaper is safe. Rabbits bathe themselve but if their coat gets a litter dirty put some baby powder on rub it around his coat and brush it out the dirt in the coat clings to the baby powder. I feed my rabbits all kinds of stuff even a little chicken here and there they are still fine and of corse pellets and hay, most vegtibles are fine, No jolipenio peppers though. Giving your rabbit that space to run around every day is great.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Tiled floor? That's fine :) They have furry feet and the feet will not get too cold. Unfortunately, though, especially in an older rabbit, it can be hard for them to move around on.<br>  As for the alfalfa in the box, since he is older than 6 months old...way older...you should feed him mainly Timothy hay. Too much alfalfa can cause urinary stones because of the high amounts of calcium. <br>  Newspaper? You can put newspaper in his play area, but make sure it is only black ink, and not colored.<br>  Food? Raisins are ok, but only in VERY small amounts. Make sure he gets a constant supply of Timothy hay. He should get approx. 1 cup of greens each day. Some grocery stores have a mix of bagged greens that are perfect. The bag has mustard greens, collard greens, and turnip greens. The Animal Planet food is not the best because its main ingredient is alfalfa. I would recommend Kaytee Timothy Complete, or even better, Oxbow Bunny Basics T.<br>  Bathing? I would not recommend bathing unless he has feces stuck to his bottom and is unable to clean it. Even then, you only use a wet washcloth with a small amount of mild soap. Never give a complete bath to a rabbit.<br>  <br>  Any other questions? hehe|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Most rabbits hate tile. It's uncomfortable to lay down on, and it's chilly. They also can't move around on it very easily - not enough traction. Give him carpet to run on, if possible. <br>  <br>  Black and white newsprint won't harm him (or your gerbil), but I would stay away from coloured prints. <br>  <br>  Timothy Hay should actually be the primary part of a rabbit's diet, just because it wears down their teeth (they are growing constantly).  Make sure he always has something to chew. Fortified pellets are probably enough nutritionally though. Careful about the raisins, they are full of sugar and you don't want him to get fat or have other problems - you should only give them to him occasionally. Try to get him on some other greens that are less sugary, if you can.<br>  <br>  You don't have to bathe your rabbit, ever, unless he's super dirty. As I'm sure you've noticed, they hate baths and are very clean normally.<br>  <br>  All in all, seems like you're doing ok if you've had him this long.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	when i was a kid, we had a rabbit, and we thought it would eat what rabbits eat in cartoons... lettuce and carrots.. THIS IS NOT TRUE. He died. it was very disturbing... and this is all the advice I can give... cuz we failed. So don't make the mistake we did!|`|m32Oq4cfaa	The only worry I would have about the tile is him slipping.  As you know, rabbits have furry feet.  If he got spooked somehow and felt the need to bolt to safety he could slide and break a leg.  Maybe put down an area rug or something for when he is out.  Something his feet get get a grip on.<br>  <br>  The newspaper should be fine.  Try to avoid the shiney, colorful paper like flyers and magazines.<br>  <br>  You give him pellets but how much?  A rabbit really only needs 1/4 to 1/2 cup a day, depending on size.  Also unlimited timothy hay is extremely important.  Raisins and pear are ok but try to limit what he gets of those.  They have a high sugar content and too much isn't good for them.  Same with carrots as well.  Have you tried carrot tops?  Other good veggies are romaine lettuce, parsley, dandelion, cilantro.  Cucumber, celery, and iceburg lettuce are no-no's.<br>  <br>  Rabbits do not need to be bathed.  They do a great job of cleaning themselves.  Unless, as you said, they get messy somehow.
XIRzpBkjaa	Hey there!!  I just got my finches last week and they acted the exact same way. They hung out on that basket for 3 days, then started checking out the swing and toys..They"ll be fine. Also, I think you'll find that they LOVE that basket and will spend most time on it anyway!!  I have & have had other birds and they all pretty much act the same at first. These are my second finches and I think there just little nervous birds anyway...Good luck & congrats on your new feathered friends!!|`|qHDmcmRAaa	its normal for birds to get scared when you first get them. my parakeet droplet was scared too. spend a lot of time around them and don't cover their cage unless you have to they will get even more scared.|`|OmkxSKTwaa	As of any bird. They are just adjusting to their new surroundings. It might take a week or so before they get real comfortable. Just let them work themselves in. They will explore their cage and everything. you have nothing to worry about. But finches will always seems nervous around people becase they aren't really interactive with people. But yeah they will be alright. Don't worry :)|`|CEgq26oHaa	Yes, they will be alright.  Like the other person said, they are just getting used to their new surroundings.  I rescued a pair of finches from a friend who no longer wanted to care for them, and it took them about a week to get adjusted.
UIM8X38Oaa	It is pretty much required.  The best thing to do before entering a show is to get the rule book or ask someone in charge they will tell you if it is required or not. Usually depends if is a schooling show of not. Look for sales or I know this sounds weird but depending where you are from they do also have them at walmart (not real leather ) but they look nice and are around 20.00 to 30.00 I think.  Something to consider if you are on a tight budget. <br>  <br>  Good Luck at Your Show :)<br>  Jenny|`|5nSVdasNaa	Cowboy boots are preferred for sure if you're going to ride western.  If you are going to ride horsemanship patterns and such where you ride in chaps youre current boots could work as long as they have a proper heel.<br>  <br>  But if you are going to be doing showmanship or aren't going to wear chaps, I would go buy some cowboy boots.  <br>  <br>  I would look on eBay and find some gently used boots. You don't need anyhting too fancy, just some plain black or brown will suit you fine<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, good luck  :o)|`|780c50eb467560c6248a0ca6f53da60caa	You can show in what ever you want... However I would not let my students show in their every day wear (unless it was a schooling show). The judge will take one look at that and decide that the other entries took the time and consideration to look nice to show, they may place higher because of that. Showing is not only the horse you are also judged too. You probably will not find them new for under 50bucks though<br>  <br>  And you don't necessarily need "cowboy boots". There are paddock boots that work too. Any nice looking boot with a heel will do.|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	You need to know that many shows have regulations requiring the use of western apparel, if you're showing western.... shirts, pants, belts, boots, chaps, and hats.   Some basic open shows or schooling shows are not as specific in required clothing.  Usually the entry form will specify what clothing is expected of exhibitors.<br>  <br>  If you have questions regarding what to wear at a specific show, contact the show secretary who can provide answers for you.  Her number will be listed on the entry form should you pick up an entry form at your local feed store.  <br>  <br>   Your chaps will cover up boots that you wear...just be sure that the boot has a good riding heel on it.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://shopping.msn.com/results/shoes/bcatid4498/justin-boots/2-4561431/forsale?text=category:shoes+Brand:Justin-Boots" rel="nofollow">http://shopping.msn.com/results/shoes/bc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sierratradingpost.com/Product.aspx?baseno=75941&plp=Justin_Cowboy_Boots_-_Roper_Basics_-_For_Women&cm_mmc=PaidShopping-_-MSN-_-PCMSNUS9-_-Justin_Cowboy_Boots_-_Roper_Basics_-_For_Women&utm_source=MSN&utm_medium=PaidShopping&utm_term=Justin_Cowboy_Boots_-_Roper_Basics_-_For_Women&utm_campaign=PCMSNUS9&codesProcessed=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.sierratradingpost.com/Product...</a><br>  <br>  A link to Justin Boots.  Sierra Trading has Justin's on sale for $33.95|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	Schooling shows are quite liberal, and as long as you are wearing boots they don't seem to mind.  But if you are going to be showing at a regular show or fair, it is advised that you get cowboy boots or paddock boots that have a good heel.  <br>  <br>  Chaps or jeans will cover the upper portion of the boot. Do you normally ride english?  If so... I would invest in a nice pair of paddock boots.  Although, I wouldn't trade my cowboy boots (Roper style) for anything!  They are comfy and look great!<br>  <br>  I bought my last pair at a tack consignment shop, they were like new and have lasted me for years.  4-H tack sales, Ebay, Craigslist, etc are all great places to find used boots.  New boots are generally more than $50, but you might be able to find a pair on clearance or on sale.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|N2jvxYPcaa	Ideally you need either cowboy boots, or roper style (lace up) boots. Check to see what regulations the show will follow, that will tell you whether you must have boots, or not.<br>  If you don't own ropers or cowboy boots that fit you decently, can you borrow some? Or look in second hand stores - cowboy and roper boots actually come for sale fairly often at cheap prices - I've seen them for $10. <br>  Other options are wearing boots that aren't actually ropers, but look similiar. I've worn woman's dress boots and they looked really good, it would be hard to tell them apart at first glance from actual riding boots. I also have a pair of hiking boots from Wal-Mart that work well for riding. All you need is a decent heel, a sole that isn't too thick or textured and a dark, neutral color such as black or dark brown. Shoes are not a good idea, they are too short and the judge will be able to see your ankles and socks. Also, shoes provide no protection for your ankle bone so they aren't very comfortable. You could even use English boots and tuck your pants over them if necessary.<br>  I think the the cheap price of buying second hand boots, or the possibility of borrowing there is no reason to manage without. What are you wearing when you ride now days? Surely you are riding in a pair of boots of some sort. If they fit you well, simply buy some leather dye and polish them and they might look good enough to show in.
TdrgZwnoaa	If a dog is used to being inside it probably wouldn't appreciate being left out in the cold. But I live in farming country and dogs here are left out at night to protect property and livestock. And I have a neighbour that has three Komondors that have never seen the inside of a building except when they visit the vet. Temperatures here can reach -45F in the Winter and to date I have never heard of any dog freezing to death.|`|AA10112346	If it is cold then yes. Think of it this way if you are cold, they most likely are too.|`|QyypUfuMaa	whenever my dogs are cold they shiver. when they shiver i pet them and warm them up. but if they are left outside all night ( i would never do that shame on you if you do) they would obviously be cold. even with their "fur" coats.|`|CxoKHDzqaa	Yup, if they're hair is short & thin,then ya, they're always cold. But unless they have a very thick coat then they're fine. But otherwise than that, dogs can be cold.|`|3zv2bbolaa	If left outside in chilly weather with no protection from the elements, yes, they can become cold.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	If they are left outside then yes.  Just think if you are cold with your clothes on, then your dog is cold with his coat.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Absolutely!  Dogs suffer from weather extremes like most animals. No doubt, you've seen puppies huddle together for warmth (the original "dog pile"), and even adult dogs will sleep huddled together due to the cold.  My little Chis, while they certainly don't sleep outside, get cold at night and search for a warm cover (or body) to snuggle up to.|`|taLD45Sqaa	Not my dogs, they would probably prefer to sleep in a snowbank some nights while other nights, a sleep in their crate with the fire going nearby is nice :) They are a double coated breed though. And forget the night, one of my dogs goes swimming in the ocean in the winter and loves it!|`|aYZXi6ffaa	I agree if they are left outside than yes they will be cold.  This only makes sense.  Inside I noticed even my bigger dog loves laying on a blanket to keep her chest warm.  She does love snuggling though and will crawl under my blankets with me.  Not sure that she is necessarily cold as opposed to just like snuggling.|`|BvJKu7cGaa	when i take my dogs out in the winter and they come back inside their jaws are shivering and their teeth clank together. it's the cutest thing!!! they also sleep under the covers with me, they keep so warm on cold nights!|`|FhVobWpeaa	yes my dog gets cold and comes in under the blankets.. then I really get warm lol i am at the age where night sweats occur without a little wee furnace burrowing under the covers and snuggling up close.|`|YxGyd2yZaa	-If they are left outside in cold weather, yes.<br>  <br>  If they are inside with you, maybe, but I doubt they won't be as cold as they would be outside!!|`|a4rhTUeyaa	my dog gets cold sometimes at night<br>  when she does she comes under the covers|`|0ab5d486a988dd6b7666dfb80c376412aa	yes even though they have fur they need shelter to preserve heat to stay warm|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	If their outside and it's cold out.  And they don't have any protection.  Like a dog house.  Then yes they can become cold.  Even dogs in the house can.  Lol Mine always go under the covers because of the fan!|`|GNq2rmrNaa	yeh if it's outside then it probably will be cold|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	ummm, let me think about that one for a sec, DUH!!!
7Z3hWNewaa	In a fish tank or aquarium, not very long at all. Often times it will come in on your fish that you buy from a pet store. If you have a well-balanced tank, however, you may never notice that you have algae at all, especially if you have algae eaters (plecos, scum suckers, etc...).<br>  <br>  If the light in your fish tank is on constantly you will notice it in a few weeks. If you do notice algae it will be green spotted algae, which is a sign of a healthy tank. <br>  <br>  If you're looking into keeping algae under control: Buy some live plants to put in your aquarium as they will limit the amount of algae that grows. Live plants absorb the Nitrates in the water that algae needs to grow, and a healthy, live plant typically wins out over algae.<br>  <br>  Some algae eaters, such as a pleco (though often advertised as "the Algae Eater" in pet stores) in the tank also help out a lot.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	leave it in next to a window and leave the lights on for more than 10 hours a day you should get ur results pretty fast but if u do the opposite u shouldent have a problem with alge...(less than 6 hours of light tho)|`|3BfNshHYaa	... long time?
IPsjE9Rpaa	You need to treat it as soon as possible the swelling can only get worse not better... They have 24 hour vet's you should try to get the dog too if possible. If not you need to do your best to keep that area clean as possible if the eye is watering your going to hafta keep the gunk that will form around the eye clean or it'll get infected and the dog will for sure go blind in that eye. When you go to the Vet they will pricribe you eye drops and pain relief medicine for the dog the eye drops are hard to get in the eye but you hafta do it... My dog eye got scratched and the eye went discolored and she cant see out of it all the way it's not clear. I hope the best for you scratchs arnt ment to be taken easley...|`|AA11887983	Unlike Bea R,  I think that the vet will provide significant help to your dog.  First off, if you have never injured your eye, you have no idea how much it hurts!!  Pain medication that is appropriate for the condition can be sent home.  Also,  antibiotic drops or ointment for the eye will probably be prescribed.  If the dog is rubbing at the eye, an e-collar is recommended.  <br>  <br>  Tonight, just try a warm compress to that are of the face.  Do not give any medication, even aspirin, as it may compromise what your vet can then give.  I would suggest a trip the emergency room, but if you wait, go first thing in the morning.|`|zTeLhroWaa	You can see if she'll let you hold a warm, wet rag up to her eye.  That should help relieve any kind of swelling/inflammation that will occur after a bad scratch.<br>  <br>  I sometimes give my dogs baby aspirin if they're in pain but I wouldn't recommend it in this situation.  If she looks like she's in a lot of pain, pay careful attention to the weight requirements on the box of baby aspirin.  I usually give my dogs half of what a child would take and it seems to do the trick, but they're huge dogs.  I don't know what breed yours is so this may be bad advice.  If she's small, don't try it.|`|cRh3QXPaaa	i don't know about dogs but a scratch in the eye to a human can be very painful. a warm compress should help and maybe some moisturizing drops.  i don't think the vet will do much but bill you.  it takes a couple days but eye scratches heal rather quickly. if you are too worried then go ahead and take her to the vet. but i  think you will find that he will give you some lubricating drops and send her home to relax.|`|AA12089188	You need to wash her eye out with cool water or use you eye cleaning solution. This should help a lot. The main thing  is to make sure he doesnt rub his paw acros it because it can make it worse.
hC4Z8HIbaa	Yes, rats can tend to be jumpy. If I make a sudden move, I scare my 6ish month old boys. What you need to do is handle them more so that they get used to you. This could help cut down on their skittishness. Each rat has it's own personality, so even handeling them may not make them less skittish, but you can try.<br>  <br>  Have you checked out the website below? It is an online rat forum with tons of great info about rats and their health, diet, housing, and pretty much anything else that has to do with rats. I'm a member there, and I recommend it to all rat owners I find here. It's a great resource for all rat owners because it has a lot more reliable information that what you can find here.|`|XDCLL4Oqaa	Yea, its okay. <br>  Though one thing i do with my babies guinea pigs, is put a radio next to them while your not home, and this way they get used to laughing, music and loud noises. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8FW1PlBhaa	yes thats normal i breed them they are very lively they like to jump on to things
81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You shouldn't deworm while she is pregnant.  If she has worms really bad, then seek out the advice of a vet.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Once your female is pregnant you CANNOT worm her.you should have done it before she was mated.It is very dangerous to  worm pregnant females as they cannot tolerate any kind of medication unless an emergency.When  you have live pups they start being wormed with puppy worm syrup at 2 weeks of age and then every 2 weeks after that until 12 weeks and then every 3 months.When Mum has finished nursing and pups are weaned worm her too and make sure pups have all wormers and Mum too so it will cover the majority of worms except tapeworm and heart worm,the latter being a completely different issue|`|XdJKParRaa	Last time I checked, you don't. Once the pups are 6 weeks and go for their first vet visit they will be dewormed.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	You can use pyrantel at any time during pregnancy,but you should take her to the vet to be checked out to make sure that all is well.They can check her for other worms  that may not be killed by pyrantel.Also,she should be on a monthly heartworm  preventative like Interceptor,which would take care of hookworms,roundworms and whipworms as well. But generally,if you worm her again in about 10 days,she should be good.When the pups are born,make sure to feed the mom dog puppy food and cottage cheese to keep her calcium levels up,and worm the pups at 2,3,4,6,8 and 10 weeks.And then please get your dog spayed.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	speak with your vet- some will depend on what kind of dewormer you are using- and for what parasites|`|ulhyTxoGaa	when my dog was pregnant i didn't give her any type of medicine...call it paranoia but i didn't want her pups getting sick.<br>  <br>  thank goodness she's spayed now lol|`|AA12089188	Okay i am a vet tech and you need to deworm a pregnant dog 2 weeks before her due date because she can pass hookworms to her puppies pyrantel is a safe wormer for mom and puppies. Hookworms can cause major problems for puppies. you need to worm mom and puppies 2 weeks after birth as well. worm pupps every 2 weeks until you start them on heartworm preventative. so worm mom 2 weeks before then pups at 2, 4, 6,8 weeks old.|`|Xt6RSzZGaa	You should have dewormed her prior to mating.  You now can deworm her at day 42 but make sure it is a worming agent that is safe for pregnant and lactating bitches.  If you don't know when she mated work out the day she came on heat (blood spotting) and couldn't forward 10/11 days and work out 42 days from then.<br>  <br>  You can deworm her again 2 weeks after the pups are born..at the same time as you deworm them the first time. (2, 4, 8 weeks)|`|RDsZFfLOaa	no matter how many times you dework the mother, most likely all the puppies with get them either way. you can wait untill the puppies are born to deworm them
B6ypWiTCaa	Check out your local Petco or other large pet store and get signed up for obedience training.<br>  <br>  Essentially, dogs are pack animals and you have to establish yourself as the alpha and earn and demand the respect of your dog.<br>  <br>  I fostered a dog from a local animal shelter a little while ago.  The dog was aggressive over food and would growl and snap at anyone who came near him while he was eating.  This made him completely unable to be adopted out and he was facing being destroyed because he was four years old and they were worried he was too old to learn anything different.  I had a lot of experience with this breed (Norwegian Elkhound) so I knew they were great/friendly family dogs - this one just needed to learn some manners.  The first time he growled and snapped at me, I essentially attacked him.  I pinned him to the ground and shouted NO! in a large firm voice right into his ear.  I took the bone away briefly and then returned it.  A few days later he gave an almost apologetic growl - and I did the same thing.  After that, he wouldn't growl or snap at either my husband or I.  <br>  <br>  We were consistent - which is the key.  Your dog needs to be able to predict the consequences of biting you with 100% certainty.  Don't "try" different things.  Pick a consequence and deliver it every single time he bites.  He'll only learn when you get serious about teaching him.|`|AA12205365	Generally a high pitched yelp followed by turning your back on the dog when he gets out of line works.  Smacking the dog rarely works as the dogs tends to think it's a game.|`|3pEqG4ewaa	bite back! lol j/k. your dog is just playing and doesnt know any better. this is the time to teach him not to do that with humans. firmly hold his mouth closed say no in a deep voice and stare him in the eyes a while till he looks away.. this will work, promise!|`|V0hSx0TQaa	when the dog bites next time yelp or scream real loud like it hurts really bad. keep doing it and he will get the point because he wants to play not hurt you.  you can never allow the dog to play by biting peoples hands or fists or he will start biting again. no rope toys either until he gets the point.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	Don't hit the dog. He's a puppy and he doesn't understand why you'd hit him.<br>  <br>    It's puppy play. But I agree you should let him know that its unacceptable behavior.

Bring him to a shelter and surrender him immediately so he can get the care he needs!!  GOD!<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  Parvo is extremely contagious.  Actually, if you step where the ParvoVirus is present, it will be carried on the bottom of your shoes.  You could have picked it up at the park, a friends house or anywhere - so, it's very possible that you or someone from your house brought the virus home.<br>  <br>  It's also very possible that an infected dog came in your yard, so your pup could have gotten it that way.  Parvovirus can live outside and be contagious for over a year.<br>  <br>  And I stand by what I said - if you don't have the money to provide vet care, then you shouldn't have a dog.|`|AA10034051	sounds like parvo. he needs to be taken to the vet immediately. If not he can die|`|AA11426077	i dont want to scare you, but if you didnt get his puppy vaccines at 12 weeks which includes parvo (a deadly puppy disease) then he could have that. Its the leading cause of death in puppies and usually without vet care they die, but even with vet care there is a high chance of them dying. So if you do not have a lot of money and did not get him vaccinated for that, I would talk to your vet over the phone about your options. If you dont have a vet or have yet to take him to the vet, and you feel you want to invest the money, get your puppy to a vet right away. but you should go to the vet anyway to see if its parvo. if its not, then it probably wont be so expensive. if it turns out to be parvo, then you may want to seriously consider surrendering him to a shelter and getting him the help he deserves. and next time you get a puppy you'll know to research caring for puppies before you just go out on a whim and purchase one without giving it proper care. good luck.|`|Q4JCeVB9aa	Has he been vaccinated for canine diseases like distemper?<br>  If not, he may have contracted one of the several viruses that they can get.   <br>  <br>  If you cannot afford a vet and he has not been vaccinated, your choices are very limited.  Unfortunately, there is little you can do on your own to pull him through.<br>  <br>  He if he has been vaccinated, you can hope he gets through this rough spot.   He will need to be kept hydrated.|`|AA12089188	First has he had any vaccinations. 2 you need to make sure he does not dehydrate. Normal temp for a dog is 101.5. The only way to get a good accurate temp in rectally. You really need to get a fecal and possibly a parvo test done. It could be as simple as hookworms or camplyobacter. Just because their is no blood you really cant rule out parvo. She really needs to be seen by a vet. The clinic i work for will work out a payment plan or post dated check so see if you can find one like that.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	YOU MUST get this baby to an Urgent Care center, or your VET.....

wd5zHEq7aa	There is a good chance that the parents are carrying the virus, although they may not show any symptoms. Unfortunately my opinion is to euthanise the pups if they are so ill as the virus affects the brain and can cause damage and later death. Talk to a vet about the pups and parents and don't let them breed again as it is contagious. They may be new treatments but I don't think there is a cure, could be wrong but tak to the vet and keep them isolated
AA11887983	I could think of a bunch of reasons that your pup doesn't like to be carried.  It is not normal for them to be held that high up.

Don't let him in the kitchen or areas where trash cans are.<br>  6. Don't put "goodies" in the trash.  If there are no food products he'll leave it alone.

Or rather, what type of lid it has.  Our golden when he was a puppy got into the trash a few times.  I bought a new trash can with a lid that slides upward.  He can't figure out how to get into it now.  Perhaps your lab is just pushing the entire trash can over - then I would suggest one of those heavy duty stainless steel trash cans with the foot lever.  They're expensive but maybe worth it?  Otherwise, you could try spritzing bitter apple spray on the lid.  If all those fail, then removing it while you are away will have to do.  It would be awful if he ate something and choked or had to have intestinal surgery.  Good luck!|`|xQeolc88aa	That's just it, you don't set your dog up for a failure.

Fc1qkfHJaa	You need to teach your dogs that any fighting in not acceptable.  As soon as they start to fight, separate them and put the in a 'time out' where they can calm down.  This should help them learn not to fight.  They also need to be socialized properly, so that they don't fight with other dog.  Good luck.
m0e3a3gWaa	First, great to hear.<br>  I love piranhas and I have been keeping them for 15 years now.<br>  They get a bad rap on this site.<br>  You could keep 4 RB in that tank (if you buy babies, 1 inch or so) for about a year, then they will out grow the tank.<br>  They grow extremly fast.<br>  I will start with the tank.<br>  Yes, get triple the filtartion required for the tank size.<br>  You don't have to do this right away though, once they get to about 4 inches is when you will start to realize what a messy fish they are.<br>  I will say the most important decoration you can put in your tank is floating plants, the fake kinds work really well.<br>  You are right when you mentioned they like a muted light.<br>  The floating plant will help achieve this no matter what bulb you choose.<br>  This will also make the fish feel secure, and in no time at all your piranahs will stay out in the open all the time and not dash for cover at the first sign of miovement like most piranhas do.<br>  I like to mimic their natual enviorment as much as possible so I furnish the tank with allot of drift wood.<br>  I also don't use many planted plants, it makes it tougher to vacum the substrate, but plants attached to the driftwood itself.<br>  Also for substrate I use sand.<br>  Much easier to clean then gravel.<br>  <br>  Its is really important that you feed your baby piranhas a minimum of 3 times a day.<br>  At that age they will certainly canabilize eachother if they are the slighest bit hungry.<br>  At this age I would be feeding them cichlid pellets, flakes, frozen blood worms and mysis shrimp.<br>  Oddly enough, I have never found RB's to really enjoy frozen brine shrimp.<br>  Once they get to 4 inches you can cut them back to twice a day feeding on the foods I have just mentioned.<br>  When they get to about 6 inches, this is where the fun begins!<br>  You can start feeding them whole fish fillets, whole shrimps, scallops, Squid.<br>  This is when feeding time becomes really fun.<br>  At this point you should be feeding them once a day, and not feeding them at all at least one day a week.<br>  Just a word on live food.<br>  I do feed my piranhas live food (comets).<br>  Why deny them a thousand years of instinct?<br>  I do this only on occasion.<br>  I have a 50 gallon set up for my feeders.<br>  When I first purchase them I treat them for EVERYTHING.<br>  Ich, flukes, anchor worm, bacterial and fungal infections, internal parasites.<br>  This process takes 2-3 weeks.<br>  Doing it this way I have never had an issue in 15 years.<br>  Hope I helped and have fun, they are an awesome fish.|`|EIBktpPgaa	have you ever considered red bellied pacus instead?<br>  they have the look of piranhas however they are much easier to keep. the only snag is youd have to upgarde the tank, but you`ll have to do it with the piranhas as well once they grow a bit. pacus are muchhhhhhh easier and often get confused for piranhas|`|iLpyQSX5aa	yes, a 55 will be a good size for a few years but you'll have to upgrade when they outgrow your tank.  They can get beyond 12" full grown but it takes a few years if you buy them as juveniles.  They also do best in a group of at least 5 or 6 so keep that in mind too.|`|rgDLovFhaa	Sounds like you are ready to go.<br>  Get 4 or 5 piranhas and a dozen goldfish and let the fun begin
GBI18gjpaa	Hi,<br>  These are instructions on how to breed ghost shrimps.<br>  <br>  1.Set up a freshwater aquarium that is large enough to keep a breeding population of ghost shrimp. The tank should be 10 gallons or larger in order to house the population comfortably. If the tank is to be shared with other species, make sure they are non-aggressive types that won’t eat the shrimp. Set up the tank with gravel, a filter, light and aeration. Get sinking pellets to feed the shrimp.<br>  <br>  Step2.Use a side filter rather than an under-gravel filter. Once you have young ghost shrimp, they will be small enough that they can fit between the rocks and be sucked into the large holes that under-gravel filters have.<br>  <br>  Step3Add a few areas in the tank for the ghost shrimp to hide. The species love to hide under things, so provide castles, rocks or other items that the shrimp can crawl into.<br>  <br>  Step4Put several males and several females together. You can tell females by their larger size. They often have small green dots underneath their abdomens. These are eggs that will eventually hatch into the baby shrimp. A female whose eggs have already hatched will have tiny pink dots under her abdomen. These are the tiny babies that are clinging to their mother.<br>  <br>  Step5Take the females who have visible eggs or babies into another tank or into a special breeding area of the same tank. A new tank should be a similar size and set up as the old one. A breeding area is a closed-off portion of the main tank. But unless the closed-off breeding area is completely closed, the tiny baby shrimp may escape and be eaten by the other fish and shrimp in the tank. The safer option is to remove them to a completely separate tank until they grow larger.<br>  <br>  Step6Take the mother out of the fry tank after the babies have hatched. If the babies are clinging to the mother, place some feed in the water to try to draw them away from her. Feed the babies young brine shrimp. The younger the baby brine shrimp, the easier it will be for the baby ghost shrimp to eat them. Once the babies are about half an inch long, they can be taken out of the fry tank and placed into the adult tank. <br>  <br>  Good Luck

Talk with your breeder, they shouldn't have a problem with it, you can find adjustable tiny collars at the pet store.<br>  <br>  If you can, I'd suggest to wait until the pup is older before making your pick.  You can't tell anything from a pup at this age, they don't even really have "personalities" yet.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	I understand your dilemma, but I would never put anything on a puppies neck. It could get hung up and choke the poor think or twisted around one of the other puppies feet. I would suggest, bright nail polish or permanent marker on someplace.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	No way they got a spayed female from a shelter without the shelter knowing.  Shelters don't adopt out pregnant, non spayed animals.  You can tell if they've been spayed by the scar on the stomach and they x-ray to check for the girl bits. Your "friend" is pulling your leg.<br>  I hope these pups are free.<br>  <br>  You don't get a collar for a 2 wk old puppy.  You ask the back yard breeder to place a colored ribbon around the pups neck to identify it for you.  If they keep a close eye on the litter there will be no problems.  I would suggest finding a distinguishing mark on your puppy and using that to identify him/her.|`|0m6BgESXaa	"No way they got a spayed female from a shelter without the shelter knowing."<br>  <br>  Not true...it happens.  Dogs have hairy bellies, you can't always see a scar.

She will sit and lay down with their cats. They mutually groom eachother, it's very cute. She's always been great with all the cats we've ever had. She is a mutt they got as a puppy at a shelter<br>  <br>  My roomies mom's dog is also great with cats, she is very similar to how my dog behaves with them she's calm and just likes to watch and cuddle them. She is a Golden.<br>  <br>  My dog however likes to chase kitties all day long. He likes them a lot and I don't think he would ever intentionally harm one, but I won't leave him alone with one of the cats in our house because she won't stick up for herself and would probably allow him to suffocate her. I've walked in one her choking because he was biting her neck like he would a dog and she wasn't doing ANYTHING.<br>  <br>  So honestly it just depends on the dog/cat dynamic. Some cats won't do well with dogs some dogs won't do well with cats. Maybe your parents know your cats wouldn't be okay with a dog? Talk to them some more, offer them some situations where it HAS worked out and talk to them about getting an adult dog that is known to already be good with cats.|`|JDxpjT34aa	My parents had two cats and a dog and they all got along fine. Dogs and cats can get along just fine, especially if you introduce the dog to the cats when the dog is still a puppy.

I doubt they'll have much to argue about against a professional.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	It's just plain ignorance on their part.  They don't know any different.

You see this all the time in cartoons. The dog fights with the cat or the cat fights with the dog. I have two cats and a dog. I adopted my dog from pound. This is always the best thing to do because pounds are always over crowded and dogs need good homes. My dog is a beagle mix and was never proven cat friendly but got along with my cats. You should NOT seperate your cats and your dog too often. If they get each others scent then you have a much better chance of them getting along. Putting up a baby crate is a very good idea for the first few months while you are not home.

Yes, change the paper every couple of days and weekly wash the plastic bottom.  Don't feed pellets that contain seeds or corn--these are not good for them.  A good grass hay like timothy (not alfalfa) is best for their diets.|`|KhjpmxGeaa	A guinea pig's diet should be comprised of three basic groups; grass hay, pellets, and fresh treats. Most importantly, a guinea pig cannot make their Vitamin C (just like people) and will need it either in vitamin supplements (not droplets, these don't work as the C dissolves to rapidly in water) or in plenty of the right fruits and veggies. Of course, every guinea pig needs a water bottle (they tend to poop in water bowls, and it could get very unhealthy).The housing should be lined with bedding at a minimum of 1 inch deep, ideally deeper in the sleeping areas. You should never use softwoods such as pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these emit harmful odors called phenols that cause your guinea pig respiratory problems. Hardwoods such as aspen are fine. Other options for bedding are recycled paper products such as Carefresh; these are more expensive, but also stay clean for longer than shavings and are easier on a guinea pig's feet. A cage needs to be cleaned generally every couple weeks at the very minimum (depending on how many cavies you own).|`|4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Printer paper is not absorbent.

After you clean the cage bottom, lay down some puppy pads and place a large towel over them. Your guinea will love the softness and the puppy pads will draw away urine and moisture.

PoWzgvBTaa	I would just like to thank you, before I answer, for opening your heart and bringing a pet in need into your family. We need more people like that in this world. =] Anyways! Your cat sounds exactly like one of the cats that I have rescued. In a comfortable environment with people she knows well, she will come to you - but if you come to her, sometimes she will be intimidated. As much as you may want her to come out of her shell, some cats just don't. To make her feel more comfortable around new people in the house or visitors, I would suggest letting her take her time. Encourage strangers not to rush over to her, or reach out to pet her too quickly. A slow, out reached hand for her to sniff before any petting is a good idea; it allows her to familiarize herself with them as well as allowing her time to rationalize and not run away. You have to take it one slow step at a time. =]<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, and that your girl comes out of her shell! =]|`|xSNpSlE7aa	Unfortunately you really can't change your cat any more than you could stop a child from being afraid of dogs. All you can do is give her as much tender loving care as you can. :)<br>  <br>  It makes sense that your cat would want to be outside as much as possible, having born outdoors.<br>  <br>  It's too bad they don't have group therapy for pets, or things would be a lot easier for you.|`|FgWx0hfPaa	hit them with a rolled up newspaper and say "bad kitty" "noo kitty"<br>  <br>  <br>  be sure to say it like eric cartman from south park|`|mJUf5cnYaa	Unfortunately, some cats are just wary around humans from the start. Basically all they need is time to get adjusted to a new person. You just want to make sure that when there is a stranger in the house, they wait until the cat is ready to come out and meet them, then they can give her treats and pets. She just needs to be exposed to plenty of new people, and have many positive experiences. Also, a lot of cats love to be rubbed, and cuddle, but hate being picked up. That will probably never change. But with enough time and persistence, the cat can be taught to trust strangers. Good luck!|`|sdOzrdgcaa	TIME, TIME, TIME! You don't know what has happened to her before you got her.

Mostly, a cat just changes its mind on its own. You can try encouraging her with food and treats but that's about it. And a cat doesn't need to like being held to be friendly with people. None of my cats like it but they won't shy away from attention.<br>  <br>  She sounds just like my cat who is 12 years old, she grew up with 2 young kids and was very shy for a long time, now she is more friendly and social with us.

6hvf02Eyaa	You won't stop a puppy from being a puppy, they are teething, learning, and curious. Most times people who know animals tell persons when getting a new pet to not couple a young dog with a small child, those are a few of the reasons.<br>  So in order to ask the puppy to act more like an adult is not fair to the puppy but a way of minimizing this is to re-direct the puppy when it gets to rough when playing, this can be done by rolling a ball away from the child so puppy can chase it, making sure puppy has teething things that are healthy for it and when it gets out of hand tell puppy "NO" then give it a Kong or something it can chew on and not be harmed.  When pup re directs to this toy say good dog! A pup will be a pup until or over 6 months of age at least so re directing takes time and patience but your dog and hopefully your child will come threw this un harmed!<br>  Scratches and nips are just a part of this puppy stage a part of learning,  the reason a rolled up paper could do more harm than good is then the dog will eventually get either aggressive or afraid of paper, we have mail carriers and newspaper boys who could end up in a world of DOO DOO  as the dog gets bigger, and stronger. Also,<br>  Spraying the dog or punishing it for being a puppy sends the wrong message you want it to grow and learn just not be so aggressive where your child is concerned. <br>  GS are such smart dogs I have trained them for many many years he will catch on just fine if you give it time! <br>  Oh make sure the ball has no sqeeky thing in it, (choking hazard,) make sure the ball is to big to be swollowed and if chewed to pieces remove all immediatly! Thats why a Kong is so good they are durable and can be stuffed with peanut butter or some goody and the dog can chew for hours and not do dammage to itself or the kong. Rawhide can expand in it's belly (another no) You want bones un cooked and watch closely! All or any loose or small pieces need removed. Hang in it will work out!|`|6sTsDvKmaa	First of all, stop trying to pet her when she is excited.  And definitely don't use the paper.  Smacking your dog will only get her more excited.  <br>  <br>  Exercise her a LOT.  German Shepherd's are fairly active and need some release for their energy.  Make sure you are walking her EVERY day for at least 20 minutes.  When she is sleepy or tired, pet her.  This will enforce in her mind that she gets pet when she is calm.   <br>  <br>  The other possibility is that she's an early teether.  Usually this happens at about 4-5 months, but if her gums are itching she will want something to chew on.  Get her a puppy chew toy, and also use the toy to redirect her attention.  When her teeth make any contact with skin, tell her "NO", immediately.  Do it in a firm but not angry tone.  Eventually when you show her your hand she should look away.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Go to puppy class she needs it for the socialization and training.  <br>  I got mine to stop by everytime she bites gently but firmly hold her lower jaw with your thumb under her tongue until she chills out.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/training_clubs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/events/obedience/trai...</a>|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	This is what all puppies do at this age, they learn through their mouths.

I have a GSD mix that was very bitey when I got her. shes a little older than yours right now and never bites anymore thanks to our training.<br>  <br>  When she puts her jaws on you and exerts pressure that becomes painful say "ow!" or make a yelp anything that will startle (but not scare don't be too loud). Immediately get up and turn away, stop paying it attention until the puppy is calm again. <br>  If she bites again and gets riled up replace your hands with a toy and play via the toy.<br>  If she gets too crazy you have to put her away/restrain her untill she is calm.<br>  <br>  Most dogs grow out of it and GSDs are usually smart and fast learning. I wish you luck! in the meantime keep your boy and dog separate or she might accidently bite his face or hands too hard at this stage.<br>  Let her get a little older, reinforce calm behavior around your son.|`|nBehRANyaa	You shouldn't be smacking a puppy at all!  If you really think that's an appropriate training method, you should return the puppy to her breeder and stick with stuffed animals.<br>  <br>  Puppies play with their teeth until they learn not to - and the learning process takes time and maturity.  Each time the pup nips, yelp like a puppy in pain loudly enough to startle her for a moment.  Then immediately redirect her to a chew toy.  Praise her for chewing on her toy instead of a person.|`|jBOHWOBtaa	What I usually do to my puppy is that I shout, "No Bite" or "No Chew"<br>  If she ever bites a person after just a little pat, tell her, "No Bite" loudly, but not too loud.<br>            Take her to a cage or some other room, a quiet room to get her to calm down. Surround her with chew toys. It works with chewing furniture too; just say, "No Chew." I don't think it will work often, but your dog really needs to learn that it isn't right.<br>            Also, if it doesn't work with just telling her those words, get a rolled up paper or newspaper and pat her gently, not too hard, and say those words so they can get into her head. Sooner or later, she has to learn that it isn't right and will never be right.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	"Well, you did buy a german shepherd. They are prone to biting-- by nature they are agressive canines. Why didn't you go with a lab?"<br>  <br>  First, that is hugely misleading and false.  Second, the dog in question is a puppy.  This is normal puppy behavior.  I have both GSDs and a lab.  My lab had just as much of a tendancy to bite at that age as the GSDs.<br>  <br>  I have found that making a noise (not yelling) or a simple "no" and redirecting the puppy to a toy works.  If it continues, I withdraw from play.  It is a form of play for them, when play ends, they learn the biting=end of play.  This is not something that happens overnight.|`|rTV5W9L2aa	You shouldn't be smaking her at all, it's archaic, it only teaches her to be abusive.

Take her lip and pinch it against her teeth and she'll learn it 's not fun to use her teeth on you or any one else. Tell her No bite when you do that. It works!|`|ydshiNrKaa	Well, first off, your 2 year old and the puppy should never be together unsupervised.  At 9 - 12 weeks, the pup is still a pup and play biting is all part of being a puppy.  don't be hitting the dog with anything as that is only going to make the dog more fearful of  you and more aggressive.  Hitting is not an option when training a puppy of any breed.  If you don't have the time to train the pup then take her to a professional to train.  It take a lot of time and patience to train a puppy let along a german shepherd.  If you have never had this breed before then  you need to get some professional help on how to train this breed.

gotklLEXaa	My tiny tea-cup chihuahua was tearing at something that had come out of her vagina, I frantically called the vet only to have him laugh and say that was a birthing sack that the pups are  in to help prevent injuries to the pups|`|QlCEpi72aa	dont worry.. many people hear the myths of dogs eating chocolate my dog is 8 YEARS OLD and has had least had many bars of chocolate...but i dont recomend you feeding them...its ok eating a tiny bit of chocolate wont poisen your dog, and dont worry u didnt know so if i were you i would just say srew the vet and move on with your life|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	No, I have never done that.<br>  <br>  Sure, it probably wasn't a big deal, but I would not be happy with a vet that laughed at me because I was concerned with the well-being of my pet.|`|FXLLY4Hjaa	NO i have not that is really rude you should address it|`|ujTH92cyaa	no but i would be angry at the vet prsn!!!!|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	I guess if Vets only hear half of the stupid question asked on Y!A dogs then I can't blame them for laughing.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	No, but then again we've never really called for anything like that. <br>  <br>  Honestly, if my vet laughed at me, like actually laughed and was blowing me off as though it was nothing when I was in a panic, I would find a new vet.<br>  <br>  That's wrong of him to laugh at you for being concerned of the health of your vet. Sure, it wasn't a big deal, but at the least he could be genuine and tell you that there was nothing to worry about and will be fine in a calm and reassuring manner, not him laughing at you.<br>  <br>  If you like your vet, stick with him. But if you've doubted him before or don't like his service, then I would suggest getting a new vet.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	If my vet ever laughed at me I would be mad, but I worked for a vet so I know what to expect and I only really call in an emergancy if I think there is something wrong. They are there to help you, you are a patient (in a sense, your dog is the patient but your the owner so that makes you the patient).|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	No, but I can understand that they aren't alarmed.  It was rude though to laugh at you because you're just looking out for your dog and you don't know unless you ask.|`|tY14vbrKaa	No, but that's because I'm familiar with amounts and things that are a genuine risk.  But hey, better safe than sorry, so good for you.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	no, but then, i have common sense to guide me.

0I9Fm00Naa	Your Room Mate is an Animal Abuser. People that will abuse one animal will abuse any animal, It's probably worse then you think if this is what she will do in your presents .Slapping the dog on the top of the head can cause a serious embolism, Punching , Hitting, or Kicking can cause internal complications as well as broken bones.All i can say is that you have three choices. 1) Animal Abuse is against the Law and by your own inaction's you are an accessory to the fact. And be prosecuted as well. Turn her in and file a complaint against her. 2) Send her packing and find your self another room mate.3) Move out and away from her your self. If you are both on the lease you can talk to your landlord about the problem your having , The landlord can either take you off the lease or your room mate.  The worse thing you can do is nothing at all. your dog will become Skid-dish around other people or suffer some other psychological trauma. I could tell you some horror stories i have dealt with, but i would have to write a book to describe them.|`|JDxpjT34aa	Your roommate is not just "teasing" your dog. If she is punching your dog and has bruised her leg that is animal abuse, not just "teasing". You need to confront her and if she doesn't take confrontation very well, well too bad for her, she deserves confrontation because of what she is doing. She could seriously hurt your dog. I would suggest finding a different roommate. If your dog is "terrified" of her then she has probably abused your dog much worse than you know when you haven't been around.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	If you continue to let this happen, you run the risk of getting charged with animal cruelty, which is a criminal offense, or you run the risk of the dog retaliating and biting the roommate.  And I guarantee she'll sue.  Someone that would do this to a pet would have no problem suing you for gobs of money.  Tell her to stop, and if she doesn't, kick her out.|`|AA11228933	Explain that your dog really responds best to attention, kindness, patience and treats for rewarding good behaviour.<br>  To have a good dog you have to be a good owner.<br>  Give her some dog treats and ask her to help you bring your dog up properly. Explain that she has to have consistent treatment and be given the same signals to adjust.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	You show her what it feels like, no one would get away with this with me around. <br>  Flat out tell her if she touches your dog again you will press charges against her. It is animal cruelty and she could seriously hurt that baby.<br>  This gal has some serious issues and needs help.|`|nd30LQhlaa	yea deff talk to your room mate! and if she doessnt listien you might need to move out! Shes being cruel to your dog and thats not right at all. Im not trying to be mean but dont worry about being a douche! and if you can confront her and you cant move out then you prolly should find a place for your dog. At least for the mean time!<br>  I hope your room mate stops though...for your poor dogs sake.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	Punch the ***** in the mouth. If you don't want to do that kid here out or find a new place. I would knock the **** out of her.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Your allowing her to mistreat a helpless animal because your afraid she will get mad?<br>  I'd make her mad on purpose just for the fun of it!<br>  Tell her not to mistreat your dog anymore.If she gives you lip move out.|`|69f74f3454bd6423f3d58ce955f6f59aaa	i would NEVER TOLERATE someone abusing my dogs!!!!<br>  turn the roommate in or something!!!!<br>  it's a helpless animal for god's sake!|`|AA10265922	if it were my dog i would run the roommate off!!!|`|7vJNHaskaa	Stand up for your dog's sake! Don't be afraid of her getting mad at you. If she doesn't stop, move out or kick her out.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You seriously need to kick her out or find somewhere else to live.  You have NO idea what she does when you aren't around.  You are putting your puppies life in danger.  Your roommate is obviously disturbed to be picking on a defenseless dog.  You need to BEAT HER ***!  Sorry, that's just how I feel about those kinds of people.<br>  If you or she can't leave then have an animal lover/lover of dogs foster your dog until you can move.  I'd do it if I were anywhere near.<br>  You had the question about your dog being dropped 4-5 feet and now it's limping.  That is grounds for a call to the cops.  Call them and report her.  Get her in trouble.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You are unwilling to help a poor creature.  I wish I had a way of reporting YOU for cruelty.  If you aren't willing to take responsibility, then you are as much at fault as someone who beats the dog.  You can't keep the dog in a purse all the time.  Dogs are meant to be wild and run around.  Shame on you for letting this happen.  How can you be unwilling to help a creature that has no way of speaking up for itself!?!?!?<br>  <br>  You are evil...<br>  <br>  ETA:  Different leases?  Talk to the leaseholder.  Tell them she is abusing your dog.  I'm sure you are unwilling to do this.  Your dog would be better off being put down than living in a place with someone who tortures them, and someone who allows it to happen.  You keep copping out.  I hope your dog gets taken away!|`|CUsqvrDPaa	Omg poor dog! I get the feeling it's only a small dog, which means it's really relying on you to protect it. I think the next time your roommate does something that you feel hurts your dog, or even makes her uncomfortable, you just need to let her know that that's the case, that your dog can't handle that kind of treatment, and more to the point, doesn't deserve it. If she refuses to leave her alone after that, you may need to take things further but hopefully once she knows that you're really not happy about it she'll stop. Don't forget, your dog is depending on you.|`|Cqyit1hzaa	I used to have the same problem that you are having. You should confront them even though it small things that are bugging you, trust me! the only way that you are going to feel better and protect your dog is by confronting them, even if your upset and yell or anything just tell them how you feel, and ask them to please stop, hopefully your roomate is respectful enough to care about what you say to him/her. She/He will most likely get upset and say things, but don't let it bug you to much, they will eventually get over the fact that you want them to stop antagonizing your dog. You might feel stupid but just do it, because it will make things much better not only between you and your dog but your roommate too! Hope the you take my advice.|`|QciqgJPuaa	kICK HER OUT! if shes abusing your dog don't take it. the poor dog.=[<br>  <br>  or tell her listen you need to stop abusing my dog ok or your out! i would say that|`|PM23RDycaa	Rehome the poor dog if you don't have the balls to put your foot down about the fact your roommate is ABUSING your animal. You do realize as her dog owner you are liable for what you ALLOW this person to do to her right?<br>  <br>  Either the roommate goes or the dog. Anyone who would do what she is doing is unstable and shouldn't be around any animal.<br>  <br>  who cares if she doesn't take confrontation well. Did it ever occur to you if she keeps this up she may either a) KILL the dog b) cripple her or c) push the dog past her breaking point and provoke a bite?<br>  <br>  ADD: You can't keep the dog in a purse all the time and you can't take her EVERYWHERE with you.
AraBfesHaa	well at my local petco, they don't separate the males and females, but the females are usually pregnant when petco gets them from the supplier anyway.<br>  My local petco will NOT sell guppy fry.  but they will give them to you for free if you want them.  I don't know why, that's just their policy.  you can probably have them all if you want them.  They said they can't or won't sell them (???)<br>  Just as long as you're prepared to have a ton of tanks to house them all once they've grown and start reproducing (as little as 2 months, so I've found out), unless you separate the males and females into different tanks before they become adolescents, or old enough to breed.]<br>  Petco usually kills the fry (at my store anyway) for that reason.  They won't keep them until they're old enough to sell, so I say go for it.  And good luck!|`|IL3szcpLaa	Guppy fry dont get eaten if they are the in a tank with ONLY guppies in it. I auctally went to petgo, and bought a pregnant guppy only to find out EXACTLY what you did.My father breed guppies as a child, and remembers not needing a breeder net.<br>  <br>  I dont think your mom will let you buy the whole batch of fry Guppies produce easily thats why they are called the "millions fish" So if you do buy them you wont have only the fry, you will have millions of them!!!. Petco checks their fish everyday, they would know,trust me.|`|ZYzhBhgJaa	Believe me, petco knows, or will know. Anytime you have a tank with guppies, you will have fry. Petco probably has new guppy fry every other day, if not every day. Guppies are the rabbits of the aquarium world. Most likely 80% of the guppies for sale are prego!|`|dJs2s9pfaa	See if they'll let you buy them. I know a friend that works at Petco and normally they catch the fry and keep them in the back until they get larger.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	You should do the responsible thing ... tell them then you can buy some buy them|`|urrmckQBaa	Yes, buy them!!|`|JF28SmHiaa	get them! they are cute. they arent to hard to take care of|`|bZhIEy1Waa	They'll have noticed and are not bothered! If the fry survive they survive, if they don't - tough! Thats not my personal views you understand but the people who work in pet shops/stores see this all the time and so are used to it, plus they haven't got the time to be fishing out fry for safe-keeping! Go back to the store, pick a staff member with a sympathetic face and ask him/her if you could fish out all the babies and you'll pay a quarter of the price of the big guppies for each baby you save! If they're nice they'll let you but you may come up against a brick wall or a jobs-worth ( oh i couldn't possibly let you do that, its more than my jobs worth!!! ). It's worth asking though and explain that you've a baby tank ready and waiting. Good luck.
JF28SmHiaa	Well my dog did the same thing.<br>  Try mixing her food with the new and the old food together then eventually her stomach will get used to it. Then switch her on to the new food.<br>  Good Luck :)|`|aCqSF87Raa	Slowly - over a period of a week or so (i've heard anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Ask your vet if you're ever concerned.) <br>  <br>  Start at a ratio of 25% new to 75% old, then 50% new to 50% old, then 75% new to 25% old, then all the way. I would expect some upset stomach (in the form of softer stool) but if it gets too bad i would call the vet and explain. <br>  <br>  He/She will tell you if you should continue the change or stop it. If you tried before and she got sick, you may have tried to change it too quickly.|`|wfdVZhK8aa	You slowly mix the foods together, add more of the food you want your dog to eat, and less of the food you don't want her to eat daily or how ever you want to do it.|`|QlCEpi72aa	well first  mix in the dog foods together (wet or dry), for a while, so once your dog is accostumed to it then change the food completely but make sure that your food choice is good, and healthy to your individual dog.|`|TM1mTj3kaa	mix it with the reg food that she always getssay half and half and after a few days go with3/4 new and 1/4 old for 4 days and you should be good it worked for my dog|`|VEfh03cAaa	little by little mix the food that you have been feeding your pet with the new food until your pet is eating only the new food..
uKOYK1Lvaa	Maybe a "history" column? And an address of owners?<br>  <br>  It's fine to play "vet" with your pets--I have done it before--just make sure you do NOT give them any medication. You can give them dog/cat treats as pretend "meds", but nothing else. And do not harm them in any way.<br>  I'd also not do anything to the hermit crabs or crayfish.|`|JRqzkUxUaa	I am assuming you mean "pretend vet". I don't know about the crabs and crayfish, but for the cat and dog you could:<br>  <br>   - look at their eyes and note whether they are clear<br>   - look in their ears/smell them so you know there is no infection<br>   - look through their fur/skin to make sure there are no bumps, lumps or skin problems<br>   - look into their mouths (CAREFULLY and only if you've done this before) and note the condition of their teeth<br>   - look at their paws and pads<br>  <br>  That's about all I can think of.|`|Vw0DtFoXaa	um... play vet.

xUNwC1B8aa	I would say you should drop the Gourami, they get a bit chunckyer than that others and by adding you would be overcrowding as a general rule.  As for the Cherry's if you did not get the Gourami you would be able to add the Cherry's much easier and as pointed out yes Cherry's should be in groups of 5 or more and best if kept in odd numbers with a 1 male to 2 female ratio because the males are constantly attempting to breed and could easily stress out females if there are few of them with many males always "bugging" them.<br>  <br>  25 gal per week water changes would be good for a small tank with that load on it as well.  If you get a good filtration going and your tank is stable and you get a good cleaning crew for the substrate, I recommend about 10 ghost shrimp or 2 crabs (but they may "get" your fish if they are slow or very small fish) then you may be able to just do a 10% once a week and still be ok but it all depends on how much you know about aquarium keeping.<br>  <br>  Sounds like an enjoyable tank! Good luck to you,<br>  Rusty aka Abilifys|`|EIBktpPgaa	sounds like a beautiful bouquet of fish... though i personally know nothing about fish schooling i hope you have a nice hood light/black light to help make their natural colors pop!|`|pcvcMePXaa	well the cherry barbs need a ****** shoal so you should go with:<br>  <br>  6-8 neon tetras<br>  6-7 cherry barbs<br>  4-5 corydoras <br>  2 ottos <br>  <br>  Just a suggestion and if you wanted a centerpiece fish you could go with a male betta, they look nice and wont be bothered by any other fish and they only fight their own kind and only males of their own kind|`|BMri9tITaa	The cherry barbs are going to need a bigger school than that.  They like schools of 5-6 like any other schooling fish.

XNxFBrbAaa	well i know that most pups need to use the bathroom after drinking, sleeping, napping, eating, chewing, playing..etc....pups need to be let out a lot....i would say when you take them out to go to the bathroom let it be like a half hour session..so you can make sure there done..i know when my saint was a pup i would take him out and he woudlnt go until right when i wanted him inside..then he would decide to go..the pup may be havin to much fun and is saving the bathroom for last...basically just stay out side extra and make sure your pup is really done...and if this means taking extra trips outside to the bathroom..then do it...hope this helped some...

tY14vbrKaa	I wouldn't choose either of them, since I prefer dogs that are a little larger...  But Yorkie's are notoriously intelligent, and with consistent and positive training, you could have a well trained dog... but then again, that is true with any breed.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I'd go with a maltese.  They are overall more friendly.<br>  <br>  Whatever you choose, get it from a good breeder.  AKC registration doesn't cut it anymore.  I'm seeing poorly bred dogs of both breeds. Yorkies are 3 times larger than they should be... don't even look like Yorkies (look like terrier mutts).  Personally I wouldn't buy a dog of either of those two breeds from anyone unless they have proof both parents are champion titled and free of genetic defects.  Yes, I'll pay the $1000+ too... but only if those requirements are met.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	I would choose the Yorkie.|`|afU9Hg7Kaa	Yorkies tend to be very single person dogs. They get possessive of their owners in their old age. They are also very delicate, so depending on the dog, this means high vet bills and dog sweaters. <br>  <br>  Maltese are a bit larger and generally healthier. They are also friendly and make great social family pets. BOTH breeds require grooming and are hypoallergenic.|`|FXLLY4Hjaa	Yorkie they are cute so is maltese but i have had a yorkie b4 and they r awesome|`|TczMCBGgaa	yorkie|`|fsVTjrl6aa	Maltese <br>  They are so cute and great around people and children.
KhjpmxGeaa	Because of their short life expectancy, hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (two months). Left to their own devices, hamsters will produce several litters a year with several babies in each litter. Male and female hamsters are therefore usually kept in separate enclosures to prevent the addition of unwanted offspring. Extreme care should be taken when breeding hamsters because if the female is not in heat there is the possibility of her being violent towards the male - with possibly fatal consequences.|`|KYTTYhK0aa	Every four days the females are in heat.
KhjpmxGeaa	Bedding is an important part of a hamster's environment. They sleep in it, walk on it, play in it, burrow in it, bury in it and use it as a litter. Therefore, it is important to provide a safe, comfortable form of bedding for any hamster. There are several options available when it comes to bedding. In the past, pine shavings and cedar shavings were a popular form of bedding until it was determined that the phenols found in pine and cedar shavings can cause serious respiratory problems in hamsters. Therefore, pine and cedar bedding should never be used even though it continues to be sold. Aspen shavings are a safe alternative to pine and cedar bedding. Other safe bedding alternatives include corn cob bedding, bedding made of recycled wood pulp (such as the brand Carefresh), newspaper pellets (such as the brand Yesterday's News), as well as others.|`|YymOCkWQaa	Could be since it's a new smell. If nothing else happened, and that's the only drastic change, I wouldnt worry about it to much. Hamsters will be...

sMVKFBk9aa	I have asthma and I smell my green cheek conure all the time with no ill effects.  He is always cuddling me around my neck and face and will kiss me.  If you were going to get sick from him it would have already happened.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	I know people that have been bird sniffing for years and it doesn't seem to have done any harm. Go ahead and sniff away,<br>  <br>  I gotta ask---- what kind of shots is your bird getting that has to be up dated? The only thing I know of is a vaccination for something I have forgotten but that's a one time deal and lupron shots for excessive egg laying . Is my vet behind the times?|`|2Ku4DuvCaa	Not unless you're sniffing him so hard that you're getting feathers caught in your nose!<br>  <br>  I tend to smell my Senegal before showering him in cuddles, too, because his belly always smells like fruit. <br>  <br>  Also... what shots? The only shots that he should have ever had were any vaccinations he needed when he was just a chick.|`|XrPwrWPcaa	Nope! If he's up to date with his shots and takes baths regularly, then you should be fine. There is nothing wrong with smelling your conure. If he smells clean and is happy around you, then there is nothing to worry about. You seem to be taking good care of him and that's a good thing! :-)|`|lNzhglLFaa	in the long run you may get some respiratory issues...i would consult your doctor and see what he thinks|`|AA11767019	Nope!

W2GcDwyOaa	I haven't heard much about Guinea Pigs, I have never owned on, but I have heard that they are almost exactly like a rabbit. I've also heard that they bite and scratch a lot! <br>  <br>  My best bet for you...get a Ferret - more fun!|`|q0vKbocHaa	before you get your GUINEA pig, make you know enough about it by DOING researh. Not asking people here. <br>  <br>  <br>  oh and make sure you know how to spell it right. Otherwise you look very dumb and niave|`|C8OmB17Gaa	yes! my friend just got one and she loves him! they are fun and easy to take care of!|`|0hZq1sZSaa	when i was younger i had to miniature rabbits. this lady down the road from us had a farm and she was giving away guinea pigs so we took one. it was the cutest thing ever. so friendly and everything. when we got home we put it in with our rabbits and decided to name it piglet. as soon as we shut the cage door the male rabbit started to attack piglet. long story short we ended up giving him away. it was very sad. but he was happy and thats all that counts.|`|U7ZOCbUNaa	They are very sketchy. They smeel bad too. i would go with a cat or something there more fun and make better pets.
iJtuhLMTaa	While 65lbs is the more typical range for a Dobie b*tch 55 is not outside the normal range for them.  Your breeder would be best suited to tell you about his or her lines and the size you should expect her to get.   Dobies tend to continue to fill-out a bit until they are 2-2.5 yrs old so she may get a bit heavier but not much.<br>  <br>  As far as being intemidating at 55lb doberman is still a Doberman and anyone with nefarious purposes would think twice|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Did you actually research the breed before getting her?<br>  <br>  A female will only get to be about 24" high (shoulders to ground) and weigh around 65 lbs.  They are intelligent, easy to train, fearless, loyal, noble and NOT vicious. :)|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Most of the bigger dogs, are not technically full grown until they are 2. If she is full grown height wise she might just not gain anymore though she might eventually build more muscle and weigh more.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	If her height is within the standard then that alone should be a good enough deterant to people. They arn't going to ask how much she weighs.<br>  <br>  Yes that is definitely on the smaller side but dobermans don't often fill out completey until 2 years old. As long as she is healthy I wouldn't worry about it.
ea8b5dd5d148321df6363a7cdb939e90aa	She has her reasons for whining.  It's up to you to figure out what those reasons are.  I would venture to guess she's restless/anxious and in need of physical/mental stimulation to release pent up energy/boredom.  When she whines, wait until she stops whining for a few seconds then reward her with at least 20 minutes of play/exercise/walking as opposed to rewards of food, a pat or verbal praise.  Punishment will only increase the anxiety.  Good luck!|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Have you tried to find the source of the whining rather than a punishment??? Has her hips been x-rayed for dysplacia? Could she have some other problem? Your vet can help diagnose the situation. I am sure you would not want to continue hurting her when she seems already upset or hurting.  There are some dogs who do this although it is rare for no reason. If that's the case you either have to live with it or re-home her is all I can think but i would always try a vet first!|`|qgeI6Chxaa	Whatever you do, don't give her what she wants. I would guess that in most cases she just wants your attention, and when she whines you give it to her (even if it's negative attention). Ignore her whining and make sure to give her plenty of attention during the times she's quiet.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	If she's not sick ... she needs more exercise.  <br>  <br>  A tired dog is a good dog.|`|XNxFBrbAaa	i am kinda having the same issue with my other dog (shepherd mix, male)..he will whine for no reason...it SEEMS anyways...but i have paid attention so that i coudl try and see when he does it.....so i know if a vet trip is in order...but he seems to do it when he wants out(obviously)...he will whine at another dog if they dont play when he wants to...he whines if i dont let him on the bed every time he wants to be on the bed...he whines when he wants attention...and he'll whine if he knows i am going out..but a dog always has a reason.....just monitor your dog and see when they do it...if you cant pinpoint anything then take him to the vet and make sure there sint anything wrong with him....hope this helped some...|`|14S2PmqEaa	I have a pitbull she is 19 months.  She whines for no reason too.  Most of her whining came from us taking her toys away because they were dirty and torn up. So we got her some new ones. Now she only whines when she needs to go outside.  Try toys, my dog likes tennis balls too.|`|mtoUep7Iaa	take her to the vet she could be sick|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Well is she whining for attention? when crated? anxious? Please elaborate.<br>  <br>  Have you tried ignoring her? Shock collars will only make it worse, like a pinch collar will too.|`|AA10265922	she is trying to tell you something!!!you have to try to find out what it is!!keep trying,do not give up
OrvTG44laa	The dogo argentino would be a great choice.  These are about 100 pounds, give or take 5 pounds.  They are great guard dogs.  These dogs would destroy a coyote.  Coyotes are only about 30 pounds.  The Dogo Argentino is over 3 times the coyote's size.  The coyote would have enough brains to stay away.  3 is a better idea.  3 of these large dogs will probably scare off a pack of coyotes, and it is much safer for the dogs to be in groups.  These dogs are good with dogs that they were raised with.  They were actually bred to not be so aggressive towards other dogs, so that they could hunt in packs.  I'm sure that if a stray came over though, they would keep it away.  I do not know if they will run away or not.  They are very intelligent, so I'm guessing they could be easily trained not to.  They will be great companions too.  <br>  As I said in your last question, make sure you keep a rifle with you.  There could always be too many coyotes.  Don't play with your dog's life.|`|xQeolc88aa	I think you would be happy with great pyrenees. They are ultimate farm dogs - livestock and property guards.|`|FyP4QFJ1aa	German sheppards and Dobermen would be my picks. Big and very loyal companions... and will perform their "duty" extremely well. Hope I helped a little :)|`|0tlkSKScaa	Great Dane or Doberman|`|CUsqvrDPaa	Since I'm guessing the dog would be spending a fair bit of time outside, I'd probably suggest a german shepherd over a doberman just because dobes can get cold. Argentine Dogo (also known as the Dogo Argentino or Argentinian Mastiff) is another great option as they were bred not only to protect your property from thieves but also from large wild animals, like cougars and things. They are extremely loyal and very affectionate with their families, so you'd need to spend quite a bit of time with the dog to keep him happy, but if you did so, I doubt he'd be inclined to leave. I know they're illegal in Australia and the UK as well, so best to check first to make sure they're allowed where you are. Otherwise, rotties wouldn't be a bad option, or any of the belgian shepherd types either. Pyrenean Mountain Dog (or the Great Pyrenees), could also be a good option, though they tend to enjoy having livestock to watch over.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	If you were that experienced, you'd know that all dogs have the potenial to wander.
LAXxaxAZaa	It depends on the quality of the horse you want. It'll cost about $5,000 to import the horse to the USA. But the cost of the horse itself will probably be cheaper if you import it, because people tend to charge more for imported horses. If you're buying a very expensive horse, and $5,000 isn't a huge chunk of the total price, I would import him. But if you're buying a cheaper horse, I don't think it would be worth it to import.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You might get a cheap horse in Germany but when you pay shipping, around $15,000, it's cheaper to buy here. Horses are cheap right now because of the economy. Look around. Don't forget either that you get what you pay for. A cheap German horse is no different than a cheap American horse, there's something wrong, a lack of training, etc.|`|F1j74WMkaa	my family import horses however although the price of the horses are cheaper the cost of importing them is a lot higher, also i wouldn't import a horse unless you are very experienced when buying horses.<br>  <br>  If you find a good horse and you think its worth is then go for it|`|ClQoSrMmaa	neither, you should give birth to a horse and name it bob. the end

44kEtDvIaa	I think most here have given basically the same answer .. the replies are given on the side of caution because we don't know the animal, or all the symptoms even and are basically going blind.  If the person asking knew much about their pet and illnesses, then they wouldn't be asking ... so they could also be leaving out vital info .. which is natural.  The replies are given to the best of our abilities and knowledge, but usually ended with a suggested visit to the vet if there's any doubt at all.

A dog throwing up once isn't really a big deal, but if it keeps happening it may be, because dogs aren't like us and they don't throw up becaue they get the flu.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Trust me, if the person asks a question where I have used a simple home remedy, I am happy to provide it. There are two problems with your logic, first we can't see the animal. The owner may be omitting a crucial bit of information that would change the diagnosis. Second, unless there is a simple fix that always works, and there is no question that the condition is not serious, a misdiagnosis could be a death sentence and I am not willing to take that responsibility.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	The problem is, what if it is something and the pet needs actual MEDICINE? Or possibly surgery? We can't exactly do that. <br>  <br>  And sometimes when people write like little 5 year olds, you can't understand them so its easier to say 'get the _ to the vet'.

Pets are not as immune to disease as we are.|`|30eSQJE0aa	I completely understand what you're saying.  Sometimes it's appropriate for the owner to take the dog to the vet (say, if it's been vomiting blood for two days), but sometimes just a good answer will help (if the rash on the dog's belly is just due to her rolling in the grass too much).  I really like when people try to give an intelligent suggestion rather than yelling "GO TO THE VET" all the time, and yes, we need more answers like that.  But some people just don't know when home remedies won't do anything, and they should have gone to the vet days or weeks before.  Also, some people want to know that going to the vet is the smart thing before they decide to spend 100s on a vet bill for what might be a minor affliction.  I always try to give helpful suggestions, but then again I didn't go to vet school, so I really don't know much.|`|rtSmUZNuaa	People generally resort to taking their beloved pets to the vet for a multitude of reasons, but I think the main one is because the animal can't talk and tell you what's wrong. Only someone who is certified in examining an animal can tell us what is wrong with our dear pets, and tell us what we can do to make it feel better. A "Regular Joe" can't tell you what to do if your dog eats chocolate or if your cat chews on a pointsettia plant. They probably come on here to see if there is a vet online who can answer the question and save them about $500.

iLpyQSX5aa	Ok, first off is the salt iodinized? If not than your completely fine.  Most of the fish you have actually prefer a little bit of salt in the aquarium. I have used non iodinized table salt in my gourami aquarium<br>  for a few months now and have had no problems.  If it contained iodine and if it was a small amount  then you should be fine.

Not to mention that the people you trust the most are upset.  If nothing else, you would probably be really tired the next day, just from the stress.  Give her a day or two.

Could she have inhaled smoke?|`|6sTsDvKmaa	First off, glad everyone was okay!<br>  <br>  As for your dog, it's possible she's having some emotional response, but it's far more likely that your dog senses the fear, anxiety, and sadness of you and the other people in your household.  Dogs are very sensitive to how their human pack members are feeling.  The best thing to do is play with her a lot and get your own energy levels back up.  Your other dog will likely help her out of her funk!<br>  <br>  If you're worried about her health (maybe she took in a lot of smoke?), talk to your vet immediately.  Make sure they both have plenty of water!<br>  <br>  add: As much as this may be hard, giving your dog extra affection and "babying" her when she is in a fragile state is only REINFORCING her mindset.  Give your dog space to work out her fear.  Go about your daily business.  Wait for her to regain her energy.  Dogs are not humans, and they do not comfort each other the way humans do.  The best thing you can do is act like everything is okay.  She will come around!|`|AA10246871	I am sorry to read that you had a house fire.<br>  <br>  Animals have emotions, just like we do.

PIwP8DFxaa	completely agree with dumass|`|44kEtDvIaa	Ball Pythons, Corn, Milk and King snakes all make good pets for beginners.  Check the .com site below for more info on these and snakes in general.  Also has good link for snake healthcare and handling.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	1. I like ball pythons. They don't get TOO big (males are around 3.5-4 feet full grown). That may sound to you now, but it really isn't.<br>  <br>  2. I just bought a ball python a bit over a week ago. I love him to bits. He ate the first time I fed him (frozen/thawed) and NEVER has shown any signs of aggression ie. hissing, biting or aggressive posture. he's a year old and about 2 feet long. <br>  <br>  Many people will recommend corn snakes as starters too. I prefer ball pythons because they are thicker and to me more attractive markings. They both come in A LOT of different morphs though (colour patterns). Also, because ball pythons are bigger they are a bit less fidgety. I suggest you do research on all the breeds you're considering first, then deciding which to get. Snakes are the best, I'm glad you're interested. They eat once a week, poop once a week, they don't make noise, they don't smell, don't need a lot of attention... you can leave for a week and don't even need to worry about it! As long as he has fresh water and the heat is taken care of(timer) of course. Good luck.|`|fd730c6401ce7ea65a2650f3d3bf74faaa	for a first time snake owner kingsnakes, cornsnakes, and milksnakes all make good pets. a lot of pet shops will tell you that ball pythons make good first time snakes but they really don’t…ball pythons take specific humidity requirements and ball pythons can go on really long hunger strikes (like for a year) which by the end of it both snake and owner are stressed out. kings, corns, and milks can tolerate handling and don’t need a whole lot of humidity. and they are usually docile snakes.<br>  snakes are great pets...we have 5 now (we had 24 but had to give most of them away when we moved from texas to washington state). right now we have 2 ball pythons 2 kingsnakes and 1 green tree python. they all have different personalities. one of the ball pythons thinks its arboreal and will climb on a lip that is inside the vivarium but the lip is too small for him so he eventually crashes down...and then he starts all over again. the other ball python is really sweet and she enjoys being out and chillin on my computer desk. one of our kingsnakes knows that he is really a tree snake and he is always climbing to the top of the plant in his vivarium. also if he thinks its time for him to eat and we haven’t fed him he will start biting fingers and trying to eat them. our other kingsnake just wants attention. she will come out from under her substrate when she is ready for attention and either stare out her vivarium or she will stretch her body up toward the top of the vivarium and sit there for long periods of time waiting for the top to open up...when the top finally does open up she will shoot out of the vivarium and climb up onto me. our green tree python is very alert and is pretty sure that every time we open her vivarium that we are going to feed her...she will become very alert and look out her vivarium when we open the door. if she sees that we have the squirt bottle (its a yard sprayer so we have to pump it to mist the cage) she will tuck her head under her body so that the water wont spray on her face. we have had snakes for over 2 years and i haven’t gotten bored with them at all.<br>  good luck.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	i have 2 snow corns ,2 okeetee corns,a carpet python,a claifornia king, a mexican black king,6 balls,2 grey rats and a tangerine honduran milk.think i got them all.my favorite is my kings-they were my first -and my carpet.balls are nice but kind of a pain in feeding.corns are nice but secretive.my grey rats are growing fast and getting better.if your looking at getting a snake ,look at kings,they have their own attitude.eat great ,dont get to big.i actually  wouldnt give up any of mine.they are like part of the family|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Ball pythons are cool and pretty even tempered,it's neat to watch them eat or shed.If it's warm enough u can walk around with 1 and it will just be chilling out.|`|fpGwiw8xaa	Garter snakes are GREAT pets in my experience. They require little background research for proper care and are very sweet, tame and one-hundred percent SAFE snakes that will not bite you|`|k2l20XdFaa	For a first pet snake, probably a corn would be the best. They are docile and great eaters. Ball pythons can be very picky eaters and refuse food often. They also seem to not be too active or fun to hold until they get older, they just ball up. My personal favorite is my red-tailed boa. She is always alert, never refuses a meal, and is the most fun to hold. They only con to these snakes, is they will get pretty large. I plan on breeding boa's soon and this week I just ordered a ghost boa. They are beautiful and the most fun. Hope this helps.

They are the only fish that do not get stung by the tentacles of the sea anemone. Clownfish have a slimy mucus covering that protects them from the sea anemone. However, if this covering is wiped off of a clownfish, it will get stung and possibly be killed when it returns home to the anemone. The clownfish and the sea anemone help each other survive in the ocean. The clownfish, while being provided with food, cleans away fish and algae leftovers from the anemone. In addition, the sea anemones are given better water circulation because the clownfish fan their fins while swimming about.<br>  <br>  btw..in FINDING NEMO..u can see it too :p
meoRbjgCaa	I'm not sure if your trying this in a round pen, but that's the first thing you need.  Second, he sounds pretty smart in that he has figured out when he walks into you he no longer has to work.  I taught my horse  just by keeping the whip behind him (as his guide) to motivate him forward.  (I'm not sure if Patrick is lazy or not)  When he would walk in toward me, I would step to the side that is closest to his hindquarters and urge him on with the lounge whip.  They eventually get the idea and follow the round pen.  When you are done, let off the whip motivation and relax, they will begin to recognize this as a sign to stop.  Eventually, even the slightest change in your body movement he will recognize as a sign of something.  <br>  There are many natural horsemanship DVD's that follow this type of horsey psychology.  They implement different games and fun stuff.  They can explain it in much better detail.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	<a href="http://www.raraequus.com/edu1/free_lunge_horse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.raraequus.com/edu1/free_lunge...</a><br>  heres a video :  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/video_2350012_where-stand-free-lunging-horse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/video_2350012_where-...</a><br>  <br>  You need to "push him away" from you.. get your body to the rear of him and push him with a hand in the air,, don't let him be even with you, that is.. stay to the rear of him.

I aways start on the lounge line and develop communication and voice commands walk, trot, and canter etc. IF you want to really start to perfect it would have all those voice commands down pat then start to use them with him with out a rope.  And remember he should not be walking into your space until you invite him in.  What starts to happen is when you take off the rope and starts to run around he is likely to start creeping in on you and even run you over.   So you could have a cue when it is time for him to come to.  How we do it is once they have stopped and settled we then say come here.  <br>  <br>  Hope this gives you some ideas,<br>  Jenny|`|F1j74WMkaa	I would suggest that you do some lunging first, then take him off the lunge line,<br>  <br>  if he tries to come into you, give him a firm push with your body,<br>  <br>  again if he decides he wants to come in off the circle, point the whip at his shoulder (don't use it on his shoulder tho). <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|dbMv10CIaa	i would let him know that you are in control. put him on the lunge line until he is comfortable then reward him. after a while he should figure out that he should do as he is told and listen and then let him off the lunge  line. make sure that you reward him afterwards for doing a good job.

Were the other fish with him before? Is the water cloudy? Is he twitching or darting around the tank at all? If that is happening it might be a parasitic infection. Those are harder to notice than bacterial or fungal and can affect appetite.<br>  <br>  Try blood worms if you don't think anything else is wrong. They have a strong smell and can entice eating. :)
SLSX6QQsaa	I wouldn't take her to the vet, yet.  If it was a cold, most likely she would have symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, or just discharge from her nose or eyes.  It could be something as simple as broken blood vessels from a strenuous activity, or maybe she got something in her eye.  Only time will tell if things get better or something more happens.  It could be a million things, also an allergy is something that could make her eyes red but no other symptom.  Maybe she got into a different kind of plant outside, or something else.  Anyways, don't worry.  If things get worse go ahead and take her in.  I'm sure shes going to be fine.|`|mtoUep7Iaa	she could have pink eye|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Has she been excited or straining on the leash recently?

TkJn9gO0aa	From personal experience:<br>  <br>  I found a timber rattlesnake Dead On the Road awhile back and decided to try some home taxonomy on its skull(see my "Questions Asked" on my profile page.<br>  <br>  I can just say this: It's not as easy as it sounds LOL! <br>  <br>  First off, there IS still venom in the snake's glands(along the side of the head in fixed snug against the actual skull) and most likely some venom in the actual hinged fangs. BE VERY CAREFUL! Although it is highly unlikely any venom will be injected as the snake IS dead, there is still some rather potent venom and syringes involved so caution is recommended. <br>  <br>  I skinned the epidermis and scales first. This was easy, although the eyes had to be cut off/out in the process.<br>  <br>  Then I proceeded to boil it..........the smell is HORRIBLE! And try not to inhale the steam, as it may be boiling the actual venom still in the glands and could enter your lungs when you inhale and enter your bloodstream via your villi lining the lungs.<br>  <br>  Boiling helped tenderized the structural integrity of the flesh, but really didn't do that much.<br>  <br>  The best way to go about doing this is to take it somewhere with a Dermastid colony (carrion-eating beetle)......this means a university or a taxidermist usually. They probably wouldn't charge you much(or if at all) for just placing the skull in their beetle tank for a few hours. They key here is to try to get rid of most of the tissue but still have the cartilage holding the different skull bones together. <br>  <br>  Over-boiling can ruin the integrity of the cartilage too, so do it in small exposure periods at a time. <br>  <br>  There is another method that sounded convincing: Simply place the skull in a glass jar filled with water and allow it to sit. Eventually bacteria will start to decay the flesh and the water will turn red/brown/yellow. Simply change out the water every few days until the desired amount of decay as been achieved. This might leave the skull with a brownish color as opposed to the desired white color. You can then boil the skull for a short period and then expose it to a bleach/water solution to brighten it up. <br>  <br>  Remember taxidermy is an art. Don't expect to get it exactly right your first time.....if you really want a quality job, then finding a professional is really your best bet.|`|fd730c6401ce7ea65a2650f3d3bf74faaa	sorry he killed the snake just because he selfishly wanted the skull.  that's a real shame.  since he was ignorant enough to kill the snake to begin with you might tell him that a "dead snake" can still envonomate someone.  if he accidentally nicks himself with a fang it could be bad.  also there are reports of people being bitten by "dead snakes"  muscle jerks and such.|`|o66jqnraaa	take off the skin boil the skull and let it sit in the hot sun for about 5 hrs then put in the freezer for another 5 hrs then it will never stink. it is as easy as that.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	This is a lot harder to do than you might think.  The first thing to do is to remove as much of the skin and tissue from the head as possible, a very small pair of scissors and small forceps are the ideal tools for this job.  Next, you put the head in a small pan and you boil it until the flesh is completely cooked, then you take your forceps and carefully pick the flesh away from the bones.  The alternative method would be to remove the skin from the skull, put it in a jar of dirt and let it rot the flesh off the bone.

YnG0Tjxjaa	Healthy, fittest, and best looking like a model. It's kind of like a beauty pageant. There are people that breed dogs for work, but definitely hard to find and obtain. Good luck!|`|PM23RDycaa	A bit of both. If you want a healthy puppy you find a reputable breeder doing the proper genetic clearances for that breed and are breeding only healthy animals. And yes there are breeders who breed from working lines and work their dogs. They still should be doing the proper genetic clearances either way|`|fgxajTiBaa	If you name the specific breed you are looking for, some of us might be able to point you in the right direction in where to look for good breeders.<br>  <br>  Add: I'm not sure where you are from, but a quick search brought up this breeder. <br>  <a href="http://www.esmondrott.com/upcoming_litters.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.esmondrott.com/upcoming_litte...</a><br>  They look extremely reputable and they breed their dogs for working ability AND conformation.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Look for a breeder who will show you documents from injections, show you documents on the Dam and Sire documents of the dogs previous work if it was a Show, Family etc. . When we brought our Rottweiler, he was listed as a 'Family Dog' and others in his litter were listed as 'Guard' and 'Show'. They're all as healthy as eachother, i dont know how he picks them or anything. But when we got ours he was $500 less than the 'Show' dog and god knows how much less than a 'Guard'. But the breeder was a 'Professional' aka Pedigree listed and a Ceritified / Private Breeder at it, he had documents of everything, pictures of all his litters, numerous awards for his dogs that won in Shows, Guard etc etc. You wanna look for a Rotty breeder who will give you this info. All there dogs are usually healthy otherwise they wouldnt sell them. Sometimes 'show quality' will run through their blood of their parents blood line is for 'show'. But yeah, you want a breeder who will give you info or a certificate with the Dam and Sire - Their Dam and Sire - and Their Dam and Sire with Kennel names. <br>  Thats when you know you have a good healthy quality dog. <br>  Even go to shows and ask the people showing those dogs who their recommended breeder is. Sometimes breeders will actually be there watching their dogs and are often nominated for 'Best Breeder'.. so you just gotta do your research. These dogs are also TRAINED to do what they're doing, so you just cant get a pup who comes with a mind of commands that you dont have to train. You have to do your training to help improve what their quality is|`|JiCKFTuIaa	There is a little of all of the above.<br>  There are plenty of performance people that could care less what their dog looks like, just like their are plenty of show people that could care less if the dog could get out of it's own way let alone do what it was originally bred to do. Funny part is that both camps think they are right and everyone else is wrong.<br>  The reality is that form follows function, change the function and the form is bound to follow. As trials become more difficult (because the dog have gotten better) the function changes, the form follows. As the dogs are shown more and worked less, the function changes, the form follows.<br>  I have both working dogs and show dogs, so I see both happening all around me.|`|tTLg4u9laa	They only look "pretty" on the outside.

On the other hand you have the blue collar workers. They do a job. They are more active. They herd sheep, rescue mountain climbers, or retrieve hunters ducks. The healthiest is from the working dogs.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Absolutely.  There are breeders that choose to breed healthy, stable, powerful working stock--regardless of "coat flaws" or other such nonsense.  For example, the border collie.  Show border collies are often just fluffy examples of a black and white dog with a full white collar that wouldn't herd a sheep if it was being chased by one.  "Barbie" Collies.<br>  <br>  However, you want to find a breeder who creates beautiful AND proven workers--and that can be hard to do!|`|0pVXLyGhaa	In my experience, I had a cocker spaniel that had 95% of her pedigree as Champion show dogs and she wasn't that healthy.<br>  <br>  But she was gorgeous.  I've never seen a more beautiful cocker than her.  She had great conformation... but she was a piddle puppy meaning that she had bladder problems which is a known problem with cocker spaniels.  <br>  <br>  So I don't believe champion show dogs are necessarily the healthiest dogs.  <br>  <br>  But a responsible breeder should be breeding for health as well as looks.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	Depends what you mean by fit.  For the AKC show ring, Rottweilers are a little fatter than they really should be.  That is not saying they are in bad health, just saying they are kept "fuller" figured.  If you are looking for a working dog, go to some USRC shows, these Rottweilers are kept trim and healthy, in prime conditioning for working, usually 10-15 lbs lighter than there AKC counterparts.  But, more importantly, make sure the breeding stock is health tested.  They need clearances on their hips, elbow, heart and eyes.  And for the heart, it is better if they are cleared by an EKG doppler, than my a normal vet.  Is there a certain breeder you are looking at.

5M57TTfpaa	im sure she did and you just didnt notice. my rabbit had 4 babies almost a month ago. she is a large breed rabbit, and i still noticed her belly being bigger. did your rabbit show any unusual aggression towards you or anything else?(can say this about mine, shes always a ***** lol).  normally when they are pregnant, their food intake needs to be monitored and increased, and she should have shown nesting signs the last week before kindling(signs such as playing around with her hay, stuffing it/carrying it in her mouth instead of just eating it, digging/burrowing, just lying there). anyways, if there were no signs at all, i hope all the kits are healthy, alive, and well. did she pull out hair for them to keep them warm? mine did this right after kindling. normally its done a couple days before, but it was her first litter, so she was kinda a newbie... good luck!!|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	It could have been her first litter and her instints didn't kick in. <br>  <br>  Or she did and you didn't notice.|`|AA12169071	Well seeing that she only had 3 and not 7 or 8 like most rabbits, she may have had a small pudge that you didn't really notice.

Good luck to your bunnies!|`|W2GcDwyOaa	The usual litter is 6 to 8 babies for a rabbit and depending on the size of the babies...how well did you feed her?

P2yRAWiJaa	If she's in heat, she's not pregnant.  She's humping to try and assert her dominance in her new home.  It's nothing to worry about.<br>  You need to take her to the vet first. Find out if he can tell you if she's pregnant or not.  If she's not, get her spayed.  It's the responsible thing to do if you are going to rehome her. Otherwise, take her to a no-kill shelter and let them get her spayed.|`|nd30LQhlaa	she may be pregnant or she may not be...when my chi goes into heat her nipples get bigger too...lol...but if she is youll find out soon wheh her belly starts to harden and get bigger.|`|X1tawExBaa	no.i don't think so|`|6hvf02Eyaa	she humps for dominance dogs have no sexuality.If her mammary glands are swollen she may have a serious health issue. If she just has big nipples it may be that she was used to breed in the past or had pups or it is just her. Thanks for taking her out a bad situation a local shelter may be able to help with low cost spaying immediately so you have no worries. My dog was only $45..depends on size and age but call around. This way no one else can let her breed either.|`|fgxajTiBaa	If you are sure she's in heat then she's not pregnant. Depending on her age, the difference you are seeing in her nipples could purely be from the normal swelling that happens as an intact female continues to go through heats. You can definitely tell the difference between a female fixed at 6 months compared to 3 years, they'll have much larger nipples. I'm assuming you're going to have her spayed anyways, so once her heat is over I think you have to wait between 1-2 months to get her spayed. If you have any concerns about her being pregnant you could call your vet tomorrow.

l42UDjFGaa	I think it's really admirable and shows a lot of dedication in love, time, and money to have that many cats. I have two and find it a full time job to scoop litter twice a day, keep the food and water bowl clean and filled as needed, sweep up stray litter that always manages to get scattered to the four corners, and get all of the hair off of everything by vaccuming and using rollers <<sigh>>...all that on top of the demands of the rest of my life :)  I'd probably say the same thing, but it would be out of amazement that you can keep up with it all, not because I really think you're crazy or to be nasty to you. If more people could do what you so generously do, the shelters and rescues wouldn't be so jam packed right now. Not to mention the tremendous financial committment you make!|`|44kEtDvIaa	Unfortunately, people like to criticize other people.

C&C (cubes and cloroplast) cages are the best. Each guinea pig has to have 7.5 square feet (thats 2.5 feet by 3 feet) to be happy and healthy.

Talk to your local co-op, most have it.<br>  Run your goat, walking is good but running will do a lot more for it. I used to run my goat 1/2 a mile a day for a month before my shows. Even if it's just running around playing with him in his pen it'll work. Also, I take my goats up on a hill and put it so their butt is downwards on the hill and push against their chest and have them push back against you. This really builds muscle along their loin.<br>  Also, the night before your show only give him about 1/2 bucket of water. They get bored in their pens at shows and tank up on water giving them a big bloated belly.|`|lBbj5qOfaa	If you go to your local feed store, they usually sell a specialized market wether feed. Make sure he has plenty of room to exercise. They usually move around more if they have another goat with them.|`|9dbf939b3965c33278e687aaed48bf50aa	Go to your local co-op. They should be able to suggest some kind of supplement.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Lots and lots of walking.
4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	I'm going to agree with Carol. Too many veggies can be the culprit of soft stools. Give unlimited hay and pellets. If it doesn't clear up quickly, Rudy needs a vet visit. You don't want it to turn into diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Also keep an eye on his bum until his poops return to normal. Soft, mushy poops can stick together in the perineal sac and form a ball of poop that can get stuck. If this happens, you will need to gently remove it.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Have you given him a large amount of greens and fruit?Have you given him something new that he might have had a reaction to?<br>  <br>  Take all foods away form him with the exception of his timothy hay and his pellets. This should help with his stool very quickly, if it doe's not respond in a few hours take him to a vet ASAP as there can be several medical issues going on that this is a sing of, when guinea pigs get sick they go down hill extremely fast so you can not afford to let this rids long or you can loose him.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you|`|nPdKJyK4aa	Guinea Pigs make 2 kinds of poops. They have a 2 process digestion. They eat, it digests, they poop soft pellets which they eat and that gets digested again and then they poop harder pellets. Guinea pigs have finicky digestive systems. They need timothy hay and timothy pellets constantly. Its also best to give them 1-1 1/2 cup veggies daily and LESS than a gulfball sized portion of fruit. They need plenty of variety of veggies and vitamin C. I would give him plenty of pellets, hay and water. Leave Him alone for the day and make a vet appointment for ASAP just incase. I would like to invite you to join our guinea pig forum. We have tons of info and friendly people!<br>  <br>  We are a guinea pig website forum, named, "CAVY GALORE". We are a rescue friendly webiste, that does not believe in breeding guinea pigs. <br>  <br>  Our members are friendly, young adults, older adults, men, and also women. <br>  <br>  We share stories, & photos of our guinea pigs. We share support, & advice based on our experiences with guinea pigs. <br>  <br>  We have contests, games, a live chat room, and we also discuss other pets as well. <br>  <br>  We are ABSOLUTELY FREE to join, just tell them.."LILY invited you". <br>  <br>  Feel free to come, and have a look around.

This happens to my bunny too. Give him some space, and some Timothy Hay. He'll be fine tomorrow. But, if he isn't fine by tomorrow, take him to the vet. Usually my bunny would be good the next day.

pt52t8rqaa	don't listen to oikos. he doesn't even own any snakes. he thinks the only way to tell is to look at the tail, which is not accurate. popping and probing are the only ways and should only be done by experts, who can do it safely unlike what oikos thinks.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	If you don't know what you are doing, you really should NEVER do that. And from the sound of it, you are not sure what you are doing. You can seriously injure your snake doing that. Why don't you take him to the reptile store that you bought him from adn ask them to do it. At least you will get an answer and not hurt the snake.|`|EIBktpPgaa	popping and probing can both cause serious harm.... be careful|`|PnK25L8naa	PLEASE don't try to pop it, it can very seriously injure the snake, I had a corn that died of prolapse, and poping can cause that. Probe it!!!<br>  PLEASE!|`|nG3RCbZTaa	It is dangerous popping your snake if you don't know what you doing but if you really want to go to youtube, Ralph Davis has a video on it and I think 8 ball pythons also has a video showing you how its done, They use ball pythons but its the same technique.
0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	A portosystemic shunt usually shows symptoms much sooner in dogs.  Three years seems a bit long to go without ever having shown any sign.  It is much more common in small and toy breed dogs rather than Labrador Retrievers.  My sister had a Boston Terrier that had an intrahepatic shunt and had surgery at Texas A&M last year.  Unfortunately they could not repair the shunt due to its location in the liver and he had to be euthanized.  If the shunt is in a location that is operable then the surgery is routine and quick.  If not the prognosis is poor.  Some pets who are not candidates for surgery can be maintained on RX liver diet and Lactulose which removes the ammonia from the bloodstream.  Here are several links to really good information on the care and treatment of portosystemic shunts.  Lots of good luck to you.<br>  EDIT: If your pets only symptom is occasional vomiting have your vet check your pet for subclinical pancreatitis buy runing a CPL (canine specific lipase)  its a smap test that costs about 30$ and you get results in about 10 minutes.  I would do that before running all those expensive tests like the bild acid test.  You may need the other tests in the long run but why not do the less expensive tests first?|`|AA11887983	Is your dog showing any signs of illness?  At three, she should be if she has a congenital shunt.  If it was acquired, it would be there because of severe liver disease, so you would also see signs in that case.  <br>  <br>  Because the liver appears small on ultrasound does not in and of itself diagnose liver problems.  There are normal variations in every animal.  If your pet is losing weight, drinking and urinating more, having episodes of dizziness or disorientation associated with eating, or is jaundiced, then I would be much more concerned.  <br>  <br>  Is there any problem with blood work?  Routine enzyme tests can actually be normal if the pet has chronic liver disease, but a bile acids test can help to determine how the liver functions.  <br>  <br>  I would not be too worried unless your dog is showing clinical signs.  I have seen a lot of pets who have organs that appear different from the normal, and they didn't have any problems.  Good luck, and keep up the research.  You are your pet's best advocate. <br>  <br>  Treatment of liver shunts depends on the type.  If it is one large vessel, then surgery can be performed in some pets to fix the problem.  But if it is microscopic shunting, medical therapy is the only treatment.  Diet and certain medications that protect the liver are probably the extent of treatment.
961e1fe88a95f0b9b8011e95c339a287aa	I have been a cat freak all of my life and have owned several house cats and outdoor cats since I have lived on a farm most of my life.<br>  If you intend on keeping your cat as a house pet, I would keep it inside all of the time, especially if you live in town. When you get the cat, take it to the vet. They will advise you on shots and worming (which is especially important if the cat goes outside). If the cat is not spayed/neutered get it fixed as soon as it gets old enough. Even if the cat will never even have the chance to mate, males will spray your furniture and females in heat are really annoying. I would never recommend declawing, I think it is inhumane and painful. Get Front-Line for the cat, indoor or outdoor. Depending on where you live, you may want to only treat it in the spring/summer, or if you live somewhere warm use Front-Line all year. It sounds like a lot of stuff, but it really isn't. Cats usually require little vet care and little to no grooming care (unless it is long haired). They are great, easy pets.<br>  <br>  Things I would buy for a new cat:<br>  <br>  Pet Carrier - you will need one<br>  <br>  Litter Box and Litter - I swear by Feline Pine, it is natural and keeps odor down better than anything else.<br>  <br>  Scratch Post - If you want to keep your stuff nice.<br>  <br>  Food and Water Bowl - Needs a place to eat.<br>  <br>  Collar - Get a breakaway collar so if the cat gets hung up on something, it won't choke to death. The collar will break away.<br>  <br>  Name Tag w/ Phone Number - If the cat is lost<br>  <br>  Cat Toys and Catnip - Cats are usually playful and need some entertainment.<br>  <br>  What you feed the cat is very important, always feed quality food because it does make a difference. Purina Kitten or Indoor Formula is good for being low cost but Iams cat food is tops. I would feed hard food only and make it available all day. Soft food is like you eating junk covered in gravy everyday, you would get fat and unhealthy.<br>  Pounce treats are okay, and you can get them in tartar control or hairball control and those are always good to give once in a while.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|tp99oNxuaa	i think you should name it mesha|`|T6SPad3Haa	Adopt from a shelter! there are SO many kittens at shelters usually. Plus shelter cats usually have first vaccines and some even pay for their spaying and give you a free bag of food.<br>  <br>  Litterbox + scooper with litter.<br>  kitty toys<br>  collar + ID tag<br>  bowls for food and water.<br>  Good quality dry food.<br>  <br>  the vet will inform you on worming and flea treating.|`|xSNpSlE7aa	start with a travel case and litter box. And litter and food.<br>  and if you're not going to let your cat sleep on your furniture, then he/she will need a basket with some pillows or something.<br>  <br>  Then ask your vet about the rest.|`|8ZJclFDOaa	You can take it to the vet for a check up. He will give it a shot for distemper and other diseases
lNzhglLFaa	your other finches are picking on him.... he needs his own cage.... with a friend|`|blIUbMzaaa	It does sound like Spot is plucking Stripes.  You may have to separate them otherwise the skin could end up broken and bleeding.  Watch them and see if you can catch him doing it.  If he is plucking her you will have to keep them apart.
ZGFXBie9aa	The brown spots belong there, those are the spores... remember java ferns are just that - ferns... that's one of the ways they reproduce.<br>  <br>  Java ferns also reporoduce by producing "daughter" plants on the ends of the leaves... these break off and float around before the hairy roots latch onto something and the plant continues growing from there.
0m6BgESXaa	Sounds like an allergy or a hot spot to me|`|AA11887983	It may be seasonal allergies, or it may be associated with some discomfort in that foot or limb.  Have your vet check it out.  They should be able to give you a better idea of cause, and also how to deal with it.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Probably allergies or your dog is bored and doesn't get enough exercise, causing her to be a head-case.|`|50WCN0graa	As someone mentioned, she probably has allergies.<br>  <br>  For dogs, the most common symptom of allergies is itchy feet. As a result, you will see them gnawing at their paws. You can get allergy medicine from your vet (oral medication). Your vet also should have some topical spray (kind of like a nose spray) that can be sprayed on their paws to provide relief.<br>  <br>  Pet stores also carry over-the-counter allergy meds but, as with human meds, what you get from the vet is often stronger and more effective.<br>  <br>  I have a dog with allergies, too. = )|`|0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	It sounds like a hot spot, which could be due to a variety of things but considering what you've said it's probably allergies. You should consult with your vet to see if there's some medication your dog can take (we give mine Claritin) and also to see if the wound is infected and needs treatment. My dog had one of these recently and had to go through a round of antibiotics, but it's much better now.|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	I forgot wht this is, but my father in laws chihuahua had this habit, and one day when we went over we found out that  he chewed half his left leg off, and he didn't stop he just kept doing it, the vet had to amputate what was left and gave shots and stuff for the skin, you might want to go to a vet to check this out, good luck and hope your doggie feels better!|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Could be allergies.  For some dogs, chewing at an irritation becomes an obsession & turns into an acral lick granuloma.  Your vet can help you with the problem, good luck.|`|Jp6qXWeYaa	My dog does this as well, I am still investigating it. I think he has dry skin or eczema (sp?) or he has allergies. I have done a few home remedies that seemed to alleviate the issue. I have put vegetable or olive oil in his water and now I am currently using Organic Neem oil on the hot spots. I have just started this so I am not exactly sure how well it will work yet. Good luck.|`|lNzhglLFaa	sounds like a hot spot.... they are very itchy you can get hydrocortisone spray or cream and put that on it for the itching. that should help|`|nd30LQhlaa	my chihuahua did this and shse looked horrible its cause by an allergy and it really makes them itch..my dog eventually stopped but you might need a vet to give you meds if s/he doesnt stop after a while.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Could be some kind of allergy.  I'd have a vet check it out.
0m6BgESXaa	Neither gender is better or worse :-)  It's preference.  Don't get a Shih-Poo...they aren't a breed.<br>  <br>  Stick with a nice Poode ^_^|`|YV1bOajXaa	You can adopt a dog from a shelter or rescue group and you will know what their temperment is like from the foster home it was in.  It does not matter whether it is male or female, it is in how the dog was raised.  If you like poodles, go with a poodle.  I'm not sure how they are with children.  If you have young children, you might not want to get a little tiny poodle as it could be injured if they fall on it.|`|AA10265922	female!!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Some breeds do show differences between the sexes when it comes to training, but sometimes it's the males and sometimes it's the females that are easier to train.  And sometimes -  that difference is different with different lines within the breed ... (try saying that three times fast lol).<br>  <br>  That said, figure out what you want.  Find a good breeder.  Talk to that breeder and see what they have to say about the differences in temperment and trainability in their lines.  Make sure they know you're looking for an individual that will be very easy going and go from there.<br>  <br>  And don't get a Shi-poo ... since these dogs aren't not bred in the same manner as pure breds, temperment and level of trainability will be a crap shoot.<br>  <br>  Oh and to the person who said size might matter.  I've been training dogs for 35 years, size does not matter.  The reason I think a lot of people think that is because a lot of litter terrier breeds can be more than a bit stubborn.  But that's because they're terriers.  Not because they are small.|`|T1RZFeXJaa	I've always been told that Girls are better dogs to have, by the fact that boys go crazy if they have 2 much testosterone, Girls are easier to train and make better guard dogs.<br>  <br>  I had a boy poodle x in the past and he was crazy, but having 2 girl dogs after him and 2 boys both the girls were much more easier with everything and the boys try and be pack leaders and hav a mind of their own sometimes.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Gender doesn't matter if you spay or neuter. I'm generally against the so called hybrid mutts unless both parents are fully health tested just like a responsible purebred breeder would do.  chewing is a training issue not a breed or gender issue.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a>|`|bghHMy22aa	well 1st there no dog that wont not chew in there puppy ages if your wanting a dog not to chew get a dog that 2 or older that them past the chewing stage i like females more iv had both female and male i feel females are are more affectionate than males the down side having a female is when they go into heat but i get mine dressed straight away|`|psLk5fDGaa	Poodles are great dogs, extremely intelligent. The new hybrid breeds of Golden Retrievers and Labradors poodles seem to be becoming a family favorite. They are hypoallergenic and have great personalities.<br>  It seems to be that the smaller the dog is, the more difficult the training is but that has not been proven true. Also, the smaller the dog is, the less difficult it is to control so there is a different aspect to training involved. <br>  In my case, female dogs have been less of a hassle. It isn't true in every case but female dogs tend to be less aggressive and nicer in general but lack the personality. Hope this helps.|`|RH7K4rsmaa	Coming from personal experience, our female dogs were much better than any male dogs we ever had. However, the females tend to get overly protective - whereas the males are usually more laid back (after they get fixed). Poodles are good dogs, my grandparents had a male and he was amazing. Poodles are non-allergenic, so if anyone has an allergy they would not be affected by poodles.|`|T6SPad3Haa	training depends on personality and breed (not gender). <br>  <br>  It is generalized that female dogs as adults will be calmer and less aggressive and that males will be more boisterous.<br>  <br>  All of which is bullcrap. Spend some time with the puppy you are adopting to get to know its nature!<br>  <br>  PLEASE! adopt from a shelter! Puppies there need homes more than breeders and petstores.|`|dUyVMK9Kaa	Well I would recommend a 2nd generation labradoodle, very friendly dogs, the 2nd generations wont shed since they are 75% poodle and 25% lab. They get the lovable personalities of both breeds and just adore children. I've had my doodles around toddlers to elders and never has one been mean, nasty or attacked.<br>  As for female or male, we had prefered females over males but after we got or standard poodle, he made us second guess that idea, its pure preference. <br>  The only suggestion with a labradoodle is, if you so choose, you may want to invest in obedience training. These dogs are highly intelligent.<br>  please spay or neuter!<br>  if interested please contact me at theghostgremlin@yahoo.com havving a litter in soon.|`|XNxFBrbAaa	when it comes to female or male..its all in preference..from my experience...it seems like females can be more loving and affectionate..in like a aww thats sweet kinda way...and males tend to be more of the goof balls...and they get affection through like....yer so silly but cute kinda ways..LOL....but thats just an observation of mine, but every male and female is different...<br>  <br>  male or female doesnt determine whether er not the dog will be a good dog...how you train the dog....male/female, is what will determine that|`|HdLKeW1yaa	Well I think a Boxer is a very loving and pretective dog. They love kids and can't stand not being around them. I found males were easier to train.bigger dogs rather than smaller dogs. And Boxers also rearly chew furniture there just big goof balls. They always want to snuggle even thow there so big. POODLES ARE NOT A GOOD FAMILY DOG.|`|U7ZOCbUNaa	In my opinion Labs are the best god for a family. They are very sweet loving animals. For the most part female dogs are easier to train and can sometimes be more calm but most of the time it just depends on the dog.
TR7XorHMaa	My shih tzu is 13 and in the summer she wheezes like that but does not have any mucous.  My dog's problem is allergies and we have to give her an organic dog food with no yeast and i put yucca extract on her food.  It really helps a lot.  Your dog might have a cold and if he has phlem that means that it's gone into his lungs and that could be dangerous.  I would take them to the vet asap because that's not normal.  They could be hyperventilating because it's hard for them to breathe if their throat is obstructed with mucous.  I'm really sorry and I hope your dog feels better.|`|HAT8jivxaa	dont stay on here call a vet now ! he may be having a sezure|`|3giaPYe8aa	He probably is congested.

6SeWCfUfaa	She looks pretty Aussie to me.  <br>  <br>  The thing with Aussies is that if you go to a breeder that's mostly interested in show, you'll find very accurate representations of the breed in pictures all the internet.  But if you go to a breeder that's breeding primarily for working dogs, you find all kinds of sorta strange looking color combos that don't quite match the descriptions set down for color in breed stands and all.  That's because people who are breeding mostly for working dogs don't really give a hoo haa about the dogs color.  They just want that working ability.  Since you found her in a very rural area, that kind of scenerio would make sense.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of misconceptions about mini Aussies.  A lot of people think they are just bred down smaller versions of the Aussie.  Most are not.  Most have been mixed with other small breeds to acheive the smaller size.  This is why the Aussie parent club and AKC frown on them.  They are mixed breeds, so they are mutts that look like Aussies.  (And I say that being someone who can actually find a place in the world for these little dogs.  From what I've heard, they make great little apartment dogs for people who want a smaller dog.  I have heard some bad stories about tempments though ...)<br>  <br>  I'd be curious to know what kind of behavior you're seeing that seems weird lol.  I know Aussies better than any other breed, so I can can give you a lot of insight there.  Feel free to pm me.<br>  <br>  KO forgot to mention that the acceptable colors are just for show purposes.  it's not really a representation of all the colors that are possible with Aussies.  It's just that those are the ones that people who register their dogs breed for.  There is an underworld of people who breed strictly for work - and that's where you'll see all the weird colors coming up.  <br>  <br>  Kinda interesting really ...|`|3rCvC4eMaa	she looks just like my Sally, she is pit\choc lab\golden.|`|b2df0927cfc00ec0b4a6f61d9c5cd6e5aa	she looks like a mix of dogs.<br>  <br>  But not a pure aussie, lest as far as my knowledge goes..i've never seen a full bred black aussie. Most aussie are two colors or a tri color.|`|psLk5fDGaa	It very well could be. Her head shape is similar to a border collie or an australian shepherd. The all black is a bit strange, I haven't seen that before but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. She looks as though she could be a cross between a lab/rottweiler and an aussie. <br>  They do have those Breed I.D. tests that you could give her to find out exactly what she is if you're interested. I wanted to do one on my Aussie Mutt, but I didn't get a chance before he passed away. =( If you do get a breed I.D. test done, inform me!|`|JsBb732Maa	There are black Australian Shepherds, or almost all black, she has a little copper on her legs so she'd be a bi.

Aussies are very smart and trainable so enjoy her :-)|`|3zv2bbolaa	I would need to see her standing but she could have Aussie in her. I hesitate to say she is purebred because of the brindling in her tan points. Brindling is almost unheard of in Aussies, not impossible, just pretty darn unusual. <br>  <br>  Australian shepherds come in black, red, red merle and blue merle all with or WITHOUT white and/OR copper trim. In other words there can be solid back Aussies. There can be solid red Aussies. There can be Black and Tan Aussies or Black and white and so on...<br>  <br>  She isn't that dissimilar to my Champion *****:<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v693/Shalako/FuzzyRedball_June2008-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v693/S...</a><br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v693/Shalako/Fuzz_EastexFeb2007-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v693/S...</a><br>  <br>  For those of you confused about the colors accepted in the breed please visit the Illustrated Standard:<br>  <a href="http://www.shalakoaussies.com/BreedStandard_Color.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shalakoaussies.com/BreedStand...</a>|`|q0vKbocHaa	she looks like an aussie, but with something mixed into her.

For fun you might take her to a herding instinct test and see how she does. <br>  <br>  I have had several herding breeds, and they herd EVERYTHING. I have seen them herd a ground squirrel into its burrow, and then circle it to keep it in its "pen". They love to try to herd cats and people. They sometimes decide to add to their herd when we are hiking, and the poor person has little choice but to walk with us or be nagged the whole time. They love to herd other dogs at the dog park. And yes, they can be pretty weird.

Gta9wO3taa	Goniopora sp. scientific name is that it makes it a lot easier with fish and invert keeping as these are the other names for it too: Ball Coral, Sunflower Coral, Daisy Coral, Yoo Stone Coral. There is no knowing if your clownfish will go into it. You will have a much larger chance if your fish is ocean caught. Try and add atleast 4 more lbs of live rock in my 24 gallon I have about 30 lb. It should be a fine size and you can always frag it down the road.
OA7cPgGNaa	Startle her. Go down there, burst into the room like a tornado, and say NO! Be QUIET! or HUSH! And leave. Don't let her out. Don't do anything. Just leave.    Come back up to your room and wait. If she starts up, repeat. Try getting a newspaper and rolling it up and hitting your hand or the floor near her crate so it makes a loud noise. Repeat the NO! Be QUIET! or HUSH.    >>> Do not YELL, or HIT your dog please! >>>    Repeat this process until she stops barking. When she does, reward her immensely.    Work on this a few times a week. Pretend to go out. She will get the hint quickly that she is so be quiet in her crate.    Good luck.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	Huskies are very social and very active dogs. They are also known for being very vocal too. It sounds like she is bored and lonely. Try exercising her a lot before she is crated. MAke sure she has plenty of chew toys and mental toys (puzzles). You might try giving her a common pen area with the other siberian. They often work together to wear each other out instead of burning energy with vocalization. If you think a husky is vocal try being around a malamute in a communicative frame of mind

t85b6QMiaa	Breeding is best done in separate, specially adapted breeding tank. The pair must be well fed beforehand. Give them a varied diet so that they'll be in good condition. Do little by little water changes to reach ideal water condition for breeding.    The ideal water condition to accelerate breeding process are a pH 6.5 and soft water (4 - 7 gH). The temperature should be at 26 degrees Celsius (or 78.8 degrees Fahrenheit).    All the cory species produce in more or less the same way, with slight differences. Some will lay eggs on plants or even aquarium wall. Some dig a hole to deposit the eggs. The number of eggs produce will also differ.     You should try to monitor the process and remove the parents after the eggs are laid.    The fry can be fed on fine powdered food.

Or you can name your pet after some prominent characteristic he exhibits, like Scarlett O'Hara, if your fish were a deep red, dramatic, female, Southern Belle.  Either way, I always name my pets after something that's personal to me, like my pomeranian is Gilly, official name Gilda Radner, because she's a real cut-up character & I loved watching Gilda Radner on the old Saturday Night Live, one of my favorite comediannes.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new pet!<br>  Have a Great Day!<br>  HK|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Do you have two set ups to house each fish separately?

Just make sure your rabbit has loads of toys and plenty of food and water and give her as much attention as you have time for even if its just a stroke or cuddle every now and again. If your rabbits old then it will probably be quite happy alone and is probably more interested in being comfortable than having a friend so just make sure there is plenty of hay and straw and wood shavings for a comfy bed. Move the hutch or cage next to you whilst you are sleeping so you can dangle your hand in now and then and feed her a treat or bit of carrot. Give her of of these:  http://www.petsathome.com/find/category-...  Or something else to keep her entertained. Maybe do homework in your bedroom and let her have a run around on the floor just make sure all wires are out of the way. Or if you ever watch telly or read a book sit her in your lap. If shes a reasonably still rabbit she might sit in your lap whilst you do your homework?  Just arrange it so you take 5 minutes out of your day to give her a cuddle.  Good luck :)|`|IPu3SN7eaa	Well, when you are around play with her as much as you can.  We have a white pygmy, all alone for most of the day.

Put in there instead of water as he will think it's still his water source. If that does not work, call your vet and see what else you can do to ensure his medicine is being taken and explain all this. They will assist you or you can bring him to the vet and they will give it to him for you at no cost I believe.     Another thing is hold him by the nap on his neck so he can't move his head. It's where the mothers hold onto their babies and that will have them go limp knowing their being controlled and carried etc.   Then use the syringe to induce the medicine.     Animals are smart, they know when something is different about their food and water so will do whatever it takes to eat around the icky medicine or not eat or drink at all.     Hope I helped.|`|vwC7klVVaa	Have you tried mixing the medicine with fruit squash. You could also try wrapping him in a towel.

He is on 3 meds right now and I have to open his mouth and pop the tablets in the back of his throat. Then with a syringe I squirt a small amount of water in his mouth at the side which makes him swallow the pills.    I would fill the syringe and squirt it in the side of his mouth slowly. Do not squirt it directly down the back of his throat as he will bring it back up. You have to lift his gums and do it on the side.|`|woYQ7cp6aa	Wow, this seems pretty tough...I'd tryusing less meds & more greens. Ask your vet.|`|fypgDK53aa	*I* wouldn't add the medicine to food or water, as this will make it difficult to judge if he is getting all the medicine. Also, if they don't like the taste of the meds, they learn to not eat or drink, because they don't like the taste. Remember that rabbits are prey animals and are likely to remember and reject things a little more easily than dogs of cats.     2.2ml you can force just like any medicine, even if he fights it.   Have your syringe ready with the liquid medication.   Wrap him securely in a "bunny burrito", which means snugly in a towel, so he can not move or kick.   When medicating, I always hold my buns "like a baby" cradled on thier backs, head up, in the crook of one arm.   Place the tip of the syringe facing the opposite side of the bun's mouth and squirt slowly waiting until he swallows, praising him the whole time. He may resist a bit, but *will* swallow, and the fact that he is immobile means that he will be unable to harm himself.     Syringe feeding may be done similarly.     Recovery feed, mix with a little applesauce, pumpkin or baby food to make more palatable.

5nSVdasNaa	If I were you I would de-worm her. A pot-belly is a strong sign that she is wormy.<br>  <br>  I work at a veterinary clinic and we see a lot of horses (especially young ones) that are wormy.<br>  <br>  But make sure you rotate brands and active ingredients because if you use the same kind the worms will eventually become immune to it.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say she is too young to lunge as long as it is not too strenuous on her. Just walking and trotting would be OK for a short time. A feed with higher fat and lower protein helps with weight gain, but don't overdo it because you don't want her to get laminitis.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|WVyP2I4saa	I agree with the first two answers, my first concern would be "worms". <br>  Call your regular vet as soon as he/she is back and ask. You may want a worm count done from a manure sample.  It's very easy for foals to re infest themselves. I've known breeders and vets to worm monthly for that very reason.  If she develops a cough, it's most likely worms.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Good for you taking her for walks.  Is she up to date on Worming?<br>  And what are you feeding her?  Is she eating alot of hay (hay belly)<br>  complete horse feed (we use sterling pellets) with the hay with help fill her up with not as much hay.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just check those things and keep walking her and she should be fine<br>  Jenny|`|MK8nvkaxaa	Well they always say the Doctor knows best.  In most cases, a lot of fur and a pot belly means they are wormy.  I know you said that you worm every 8 weeks.  Maybe you need to try a different wormer.  Or ask you regular vet about it.  He should know.  If he says don't worry about it, then I wouldn't worry.  If you find that you still worry, then get a second opinion.
J3UOc8Npaa	Feed until he/she does not eat anymore. And take out the leftovers when the BD is finished because crickets will chew on you beardie|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	All have given you good answers but I would like to add and stress that you should be giving him a salad each and every day. This should be made up of collard greens, dandelion greens, mustard and or turnip greens. Try to use at least 2 if you can and mix them.  Top off with grated butternut squash, acorn squash, parsnip, peas, or sweet potato.  There are of course other things you can offer and berries are always good for a treat as well as fruits.  Never give him corn, cabbage or any lettuce and carrots only once in a while. Have fun with him. They are in my opinion wonderful pets to have.|`|5sIA8oYAaa	They will eat till they are full, can be a lot. Watch him and you can see if you are feeding too much. Each time you put the food in front of them it's like they are starving. Also give green leafy things to munch on they also like shredded carrots.|`|2kp0sijFaa	It's best to drop in about 10 at a time. They can eat between 50 & 100 crickets in one feeding!    A single feeding should be about 5-8 mintues. It's very easy to over feed a beardie, they're little piggies & don't know when to stop sometimes. Especially being so young.     I would stop him when he gets to about 50 crickets. Then you should feed him again for lunch, and once more for dinner. Never feed them two hours prior to lights out.    If feeding 3 times a day doesnt fit your schedule, just increase the number he eats for both feedings.    Their diet should be 80% crickets, and 20% greens.    AS they gey older, increase the amount of greens you offer, and decrease the amount of crix.  When full grown, their diet should be 80%greens, and 20% crix.      Good Luck with your dragon. They're great pets! I hope you keep him til he's grown, it's all woth the while.    I have 2, one is about 3 months, my other is a yr and a half.|`|9dcuaJeEaa	I have a year old beardie.

OxFsslN8aa	Although fenced-in dog parks seem like a great idea - please keep in mind that you have no idea what the temperament is of those dogs in that yard & which one will try to dominate your dog.  Dogs with fear aggression can be there and attack your dog.  Dogs with toy aggression can be there and attack over a stick. Also, if your dog is the only pet in your household, he/she may not know how to interact with all of the different "personalities" added to the park.  When you go to these parks keep a close eye on your pet & all of the others.  Good luck to you and your dog.
YnCUyvK7aa	For freshwater, they're unnecessary and won't work in the lower specific gravity.<br>  <br>  For saltwater, it depends on what you're keeping.  For fish only- and fish-only with live rock [FOWLR], they're more of an option than a necessity.  They're highly recommended for reef tanks, at least those over 20-30 gallons.<br>  <br>  What skimmers do is they create a stream of very fine bubbles, a size which can't be achieved in freshwater.  As food and wastes break down, they first become tiny protein molecules before they completely break down into ammonia.  Ammonia is dangerous to fish and invertebrates and can kill them in very small amounts.  That's why it's important to cycle your tank, to get a bacteria population to convert the ammonia to nitrite, which is also dangerous, then these are finally converted to nitrate, which is removed by water changes, or by macroalgae.  But by using a skimmer, you remove the wastes before it can break down into the ammonia in the first place.  The small protein particles attach to the outside of the air bubbles and they're pushed up through the skimmer to a collection cup where they're trapped.  The fine bubbles made by the skimmer is how it gets the other name these are known by, foam fractionaters.  The *foam* separates the nitrogen waste portion, or fraction, from the rest of the water. <br>  <br>  But if you're not keeping corals or anemones, or other species that require pristine water conditions, and are willing to keep up regular water changes, don't overfeed, and don't overstock your tank, it is possible to get by with a regular filter [a canister and/or trickle filter would be best for a tank of the size you want].<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay thousands of dollars for 1 of these either, but you should be prepared to spend several hundred for a good model.  But do some research into the different types and brands before you buy to make sure you get something dependable and efficient if you choose to get 1.<br>  Some websites that compare skimmers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/prskimmers/Protein_Skimmers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/prskimm...</a><br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Marine-Aquarium-Protein-Skimmers&id=1039459" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Marine-Aquariu...</a>|`|tDUXX7T6aa	If you have a saltwater aquarium you definately need it, but if it's a freshwater (tropical, semi-agg, cichlid) than it is not needed. I know thwy are very expensive but if u do indeed have a saltwater tank than go on craigs list and get one used.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Depends on whether or not it's a saltwater or freshwater aquarium. Freshwater aquariums do not require a protein skimmer. With saltwater aquariums, it's a way of removing organic matter from the tank before it brakes down and increases the amount of nitrites and nitrates in your tank. As long as you have other types of good filtration (canister filters work great), it's not needed.

What if you were a antelope?|`|d4f9ed600d9f018a94f306bb535b0856aa	I would say it was the cats fault?why would a cat go next to a mean dog?I asume the cat would run.|`|6zDyDOSwaa	its the owners fault obviously|`|0hZq1sZSaa	i agree with Queen of pern. no one is at fault its just nature.
AA11618168	I had mine fixed and he was fine right after the surgery.  No real pain or swelling.  After he was fixed, he completely stopped the "marking his territory" habit.  I guess he was afraid of what we might remove next time.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It is not true that he won't lift his leg.  He still will (and hump things).  Definitely keep him confined away fromt he kids until his stitches come out.  Good for you for getting him fixed!  Spay the female too and then you won't have to worry about the whole messy heat cycle.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	He will never lift his leg to mark his territory and will never hump anyone since your getting it done as a puppy. My dogs are 2 and 3 and they still squat to pee, lol. He will be groggy and the vet will tell you to put him on a leash when he goes out so he doesnt get too hyper. And if you think your daughter will mess with him, a kennel might be  good idea, although he may cry if hes not used to it. IDK how old he is but they say u should wait until theyre 6 months to get them neutered. the first day you bring him home, he might sleep a lot. But just make sure as hes healing he doesnt run a lot or he will tear his incision. the vet should give you lots of info.|`|XMnyOT8Yaa	He will still lift his leg up, maybe not at first because he will feel discomfort after the procedure. Yes, he can still hump things if he gets excited ;) He will need a few days to rest in order for it to properly heal, but after that he will be as good as new and you will not notice much of a difference in his behavior, even though many claim the dog becomes calmer. That is usually not true.    http://www.k9ring.com - Dog Breeders Online Community
qaw8BwqTaa	Ah, the dachsund. These loving companions are one of the easiest dogs to train and dispite their small size, would throw down their life to protect you! Dachsunds have the habit of attaching themselves to one person even though two people may be involved, it will surely side with one more than the other. Training these dogs at this age is very crucial to having the best dog ever! Wee pad training and going outside are starters. Use treats to reward your dog after every good doing and praise with "good boy" or "good girl". A treat such as a "BilJack" can be broken in half as to give small portions. dachsund are known for getting fat if fed too many treats. There are usually local dachsund get togethers and races that can be very fun and making your dachsund sociable.<br>  <br>     Have your parents and anyone that is going to be in constant contact with the dog hold out a treat and see if he accepts. Let the dog approach you! In the meantime reassure your dog with "its o.k" and  "good dog". I would recommend as much traing as possible while young! Iam the proud owner of a mini dachsund for 2 years! I recommend the following books.|`|AA11887983	Can they really hurt?  I would suggest that you invest in some classes ASAP. Any biting dog is not a desirable pet.  But he has been through a lot in his 6 months.  Give him the benefit of the doubt and get him into training.|`|QyypUfuMaa	the dog never was cared for by your friend the way you care for him now.  i have 2 dachshunds and they follow my mom around everywhere! they are just very protective of her too. if my dogs see someone like threatening my mom in any way they will growl. and one time one of my dogs took a snap at someone. and once my dog even took a snap at me. the puppy that you have just needs to warm up to everyone. it probably is still scared from moving from the apartment to your house. just give him a little time and a lot of love. and i don't know if you've noticed yet but dachshunds are good lap dogs. so just give him a lot of love and let him sit on your lap and take him for walks and make sure that they get enough food. oh and one more thing. i know that this is getting long. when you pick them up support them from under the butt too. when you pick him up put one arm under his tail and the other around his back. if you don't do that it can cause long term damage to his back. <br>  <br>  have fun with him though. :]|`|T1RZFeXJaa	your dog's proably used to having a companion of y our age and because you are doing everything for him he's become protective, get your parents to start off with feeding him every night and that might calm him down and warm him to the more, and slowly get them 2 take him 4 walks or give him fav toys or treats.|`|q0vKbocHaa	classes will probably help alot. As well as socialization, which can be provided by those classes|`|50WCN0graa	Working with either a trainer or animal behaviorist could definitely help.<br>  <br>  It is more expensive to take individual classes, however, I think it would be worth it for you. Instead of signing up for a longer group session (often around 8 weeks), it may serve you better to meet with someone individually for consultation a couple times. These are definitely fixable problems.<br>  <br>  If you sat down with a trainer, they can teach you how to interact with your dog differently to address these behaviors and change them. Typically, there are things that we, as owners, do that fosters or encourages the defensive, clingy behavior you are seeing with your pup. A trainer or behaviorist could help you evaluate how you interact with your dog in order to help you change things.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Do you have a crate for him? That would be a safe place for him to go if he is afraid. Training from a class or behavior therapist would help. Having your parents feed him and offer treats would help the acceptance. Make sure that he knows the "come" command and play with different family members calling him and giving a treat. Don't try to force him. He is going through an adjustment. Dachshunds are smart. He may always show a preference for one person, but should accept the other family members as his family too.|`|CEgq26oHaa	I would definatly check out the classes for the dog and get him started as soon as you could.  He's too young to be acting like that towards people, and it could be that he may be depressed from being re-homed or he just needs more time to get to know everyone.  We look like giants to dachshunds, so maybe you could have your parents get down lower to his level and see if he feels they are not so threatening that way.  But i would still do the classes.|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	classes and have your parents drop him treats, he will than associate this with good things, and may warm up to him, my sis had a shitzu that alway tried to bite me, and then i would give him goodies, until one day he jumped on my lap and started to lick me.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Yes I would enroll him in some classes.  They should help him a lot.  Along with socialization!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qe3NQIwgaa	he just loves you... and he is nervous, and your the only one he trusts you right now. get treats, and have your parents give them to the pup. let the dog know that everyone in the house loves him..
tDUXX7T6aa	Most puppies eat poop, my chihuahua only stopped when she was 12wks. If it persists she may have coprophagia. If you're really worried contact a vet. Oh...and my chihuahua is now 10 months old, shes a teacup- 2 1/2 lbs...very picky.We still haven't found a food she likes that is healthy for her. She did, however, like Science Diet nature choice for a while and it was recommended by our vet who specializes in chihuahua health, if you ave any more questions about you chi, you can ask, everyone in my family has one so i know a lot.|`|T6SPad3Haa	what type of food are you using? The dog may be lacking in some vitamins or minerals and eating its poop in attempt to digest some more.<br>  <br>  I know theres a pill you can buy to make their poop taste bad to them but try to fight the problem at its source.|`|Qe04KxYoaa	first she is two weeks to young to be away from her mother so you got her from a bad breeder. Second eating poop is normal and just something dogs do. Sign her up for training as with her being from a BYB or puppy mill you are going to need it.|`|zW5OWgXtaa	Tell her NO bad dog baddddd. And tell her to spit it out, and how does your dog get into poop?|`|AA10112346	You are feeding it crap that's why.<br>  Feed HIGH quality food.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	It's pretty common for dogs to do that. There are several different things on the market you can get for it. Ask your vet about "Deter" or 'Forbid". Sometimes these work and sometimes they don't.<br>  One reason dogs do this is because their food has grains in it that they can not digest. Feeding a grain-free dog food may help.
AA10029366	You may get better answers if you post this question in the Cats section, but I will tell you that I offer a rebate to my puppy buyers on proof of spay or neuter, and that they all seem quite happy about it.    Of course, I have other "failsafes" (I also have it written into my contract that they must spay/neuter, and I do withhold AKC registration until I've got the proof) but money back is money back nonetheless.    Just be sure to discuss spay/neuter thoroughly with anyone inquiring about the kittens and try to screen out anyone who doesn't give you a good vibe. It's also good to keep in contact with the people who take the kittens, so they don't forget who they got the kitten from (hey, it happens...I've seen it many times in dog rescue). If they forget how to contact you, they'll realize they won't get the deposit back anyway...and so the idea to spay/neuter might not be as pressing.    Thank you for being such a conscientious cat owner. Good luck!    ADD: You might also consider contacting an animal rescue group in your area (do they have private rescue groups in the UK? Not sure...). You can act as a foster for the kittens, but the group might have more luck finding them homes, and may be willing to give you leads for low cost spay/neuter. I know (at least in the USA) rescue groups have a lot better luck finding homes for kittens/cats than private citizens do. And this way, you wouldn't have to worry about burdening a shelter, since you'd be fostering the kittens.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	No mistake- you should have him neutered, never mind spaying the neighbor's cat.  I don't think you should be selling the kittens- give them away.  I doubt if people will pay the money up front when they can get free kittens elsewhere.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	Why dont you see if there is a low cost spay/neuter place around you and pay to have the kittens spayed/neutered and then adopt them out and charge what you paid?|`|taLD45Sqaa	I would take them to the shelter as they will spay/neuter them and also have good practices of finding them a home.  And for all the people jumping down your throat: **** happens, and you are dealing with it, your neighbours obviously didn't spay their cat either so I would not offer them anything for compensation. They are idiots if they didn't expect this to happen, if it wasn't your cat it would be someone elses!! Don't feel too bad as long as you neuter Tommy Boy ASAP|`|L22hVXTIaa	Okay, you made a mistake, but you're on the right road to rectifying it and you seem genuinely concerned for the welfare of the kittens.  If you can find a no kill shelter, I would surrender the kittens to them once they're weaned.  That way the kittens will be found good homes and they WILL be spayed/neutered before they are adopted out.  At least that's how our local no-kill shelters operate.  If you don't have a no-kill shelter, try some local rescue or adoption organizations which also spay/neuter before adoption.  You are right to be concerned that the people who adopt the kittens may not follow through (or may do so too late) with having the kittens spayed, so I strongly advocate for the no-kill shelter or local rescue adoption group.  Good luck!|`|s76aC4G8aa	I commend you for trying to do the right thing, yes accidents happen and it did so at least you are going about fixing it.    As for the wording of the ad, you could say that before the kittens go to a new home or the applicant considered you will require that the new owners be willing to spay or neuter the cat.  A deposit of 90 pounds will be held until proof of spay/neuter is provided, then will be fully refunded back upon receipt of spay/neuter certificate.    I think it's reasonable and you will weed out the not so serious enquiries, that's why rescues charge a fee to weed out the not serious lookers.    I think it's fine, just have people fill out an application and provide them your contact information to follow back up with you once the cat has been fixed.    Good luck|`|J5C3WKxfaa	why haven't you got your cat fixed? your tom could have gotten more than just your neighbors cat pregnant.    you probably wont get anyone wanting these kittens if you advertise like that. take the kittens to the shelter they will fix them before they re home them    tom cats can wonder for miles and there are a lot of other cats out there, the first thing you should do is fix your cat to stop you from over populating|`|q8NheXZqaa	It sounds like a good idea to me. The deposit is just high enough to make it worthwhile to return for it.
CdRlOsnyaa	you can get a heat mat put in under the tank and at most pet store you can get a reptile safe kind of flooring its green and lokks nice put thata  over the heating pad
2v2bccOCaa	Yes, dogs do that when they are scared or nervous. If he continues for 2 more months i would ask a vet.<br>  He might be scared of:<br>  -Maybe he saw something reflect and make a shiny mark on the wall.<br>  -A bird or animal outside<br>  - someone walked in and scared him<br>  -etc..|`|48EwTYV6aa	I watched a Dog Whisper show on that. The dog is going somewhere where it feels comfortable and that's a place where it knows it can get away with things so I'd tilt the chair back and make it a spot where it knows that you can get to it either way. If it sounds scared or aggressive.|`|RbHQjbpbaa	Somtimes dogs see stuff we cant see.<br>  My 1 yr old Golden Retriever goes ontop of the couch and barks at my mom.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Yes but you should train her not to|`|TDBnUpvUaa	She is probably scared or lonely.  Going under the sofa is the urban equivalent of retreating into her den.  Barking is a call to the pack.  I suggest giving her a comforting snuggle and then distracting her with a toy/game.
4SQx8smEaa	The smaller the animal the greater the risk of complications including possible death from the anesthesia.<br>  <br>  You risk something either way.<br>  <br>  I would go with not getting her fixed. I currently own a female rat (not fixed)....she is very heatlhy and is about 2 years old. Still kicking and no signs of a tumor.|`|MU453gLqaa	I had two female rats both died from tumors that developed under their necks. This was years ago.  I was probably 12,13,or 14 and now I am 40 something so I do not believe spaying them would of been an option then.|`|T6SPad3Haa	Spaying can be risky in smaller rodents because the very operation can kill them or they can die of the trauma afterward. <br>  <br>  Are you buying from a reputable breeder? Breeder rats should have healthy bloodlines and not require spaying.<br>  <br>  Pet store rats are usually from rat mills and have a higher chance of disease/tumors.<br>  <br>  If your willing to take the risk and are buying from a pet store I advise spay. <br>  My two petstore female rats died of tumors at 1-2yrs old.|`|JNnSMh64aa	If you have enough money to spay the rat, do it. I don't spay my rats, but I don't have boys, and only one of them has gotten a mammary tumor out of 7!|`|IbDcAXsaaa	How much does this cost, and why would you get surgery for another rat?<br>  <br>  I heard that certain foods can prevent some cancers and tumors and such. Good luck! :D|`|51St5GEcaa	diets rich in soy, blueberries, and other cancer-fighting foods seem to really help if you decide not to spay.<br>  <br>  I give my girls soy milk every day.
WGGxl2Qiaa	w00t ireland rocks im in county down =]       i think its only your mind playing tricks and especially as it was at night. i personally don't believe they exist and it was probably your guilt|`|0F1775TVaa	dude         seriously????      Your asking people outside the situation if it's weird that your seeing ghosts of pony's?|`|uzCaG1ayaa	You (humanely) killed an animal because it...neighed? I don't care whether it was humane or not, i don't agree with it.However, i'll start being reasonable here.  First of all you must have a lovely house (or at least a huge kitchen) to see a ghost of a horse. Second, some people believe in ghosts, some don't, it's one of the things that us humans will never really find the truth about it. I reckon you feel guilty though..|`|lx8UCLDTaa	Wow... okay. Personally I believe that animals can become spirits. Did you even try to talk to the pony's owner? I hope this is a joke.|`|PSyz50Hnaa	um you just killed an animal that wasnt yours. how the hell do you think that is ok? like i seriously want to know. email me if you want and please help me to understand how you believe it is right to do what you did. You couldnt have talked to the neighbor who owned it and asked them to keep the pony in the barn at night????  by the way.. there is NO such thing as suffocating an animal humanely. what you did was cut off the poor things air supply until it couldnt take the pain anymore and it died. that is NOT  humane!      i just dont understand how awful some people (you) can be....|`|f4WVWNxuaa	I am really hoping that you didn't actually suffocate a pony!!!  If you did, then I hope you can see its ghost an that it drives you mad for a good long time!|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	Its a good possibility that you saw a ghost of your pony....:o(|`|KFu7596Paa	is this some kind of sick joke  if this mans real he should be reported why the hell are you a lisenced slaughter man or a man that works for a hunt     if not you should hand your self in and be prosicuted for animal cruelty   you are feeling guilty and so you should that poor pony the owners should have you prosicuted     also yes i believe in the unexpected so maybe there is ghosts i think you deserve to be punished may its the pont returning to get its revenge.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Uh,to me whether your a farmer or not,suffocating a pony,ISN'T the way to go. Spirits,often come back,due to 'unfinished' business,e.g you murdering him.    Yes i have seen animal ghosts before,my beloved cat wasn't taken from me,as a she was killed by a speeding motorist. She has come back. I personally believe ghosts DO exist,however everyone believes differently.    XxX|`|2SxIkm7Xaa	Seriously? You tortured that poor thing to murder really. YOu should've called local authorities to have it removed.   The pony was looking for a place to call home, the neighing was a cry, a cry for help,  and you ended it's life when it did nothing wrong. How do you know that pony did not belong to someone? Do horses/ponies normally just roam free in your town?    So either your mind is playing tricks on you because of guilt for doing this when you should have not as there were other ways to solve this problem or yes you are being haunted by it's spirit as it's life was ended by a wrongful death. It's haunting you because of wanting revenge and wanting justice.     You will not move on from this unless you find a way to justify this mishap.     Or you are making this up.|`|YFTZM86maa	you're screwed!  you will be haunted for all your days!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	so how do you "humanely suffocate" a pony??  And did the owners not say anything??  And why am I answering this??  AH!! for 2 points of course ;)    Yes he is haunting you his head will be in your bed tonight my little bog trotter ;)|`|XT4MPPewaa	For a start, how big is your kitchen?!  and that is a question that many people will have many different answers to, i personally belive in ghosts and think that your mind will mostly ignore them if you are older, as it will think it is impossible, this is why small children see them more than adults. At the moment you will be more open to seeing ghosts as the pony will be on your mind alot and would consider seeing it.

lyhnHhuWaa	I'll agree that it's a very good brand, but don't necessarily believe it to be the best.  They've had some inconsistencies with their ingredients, etc. that have left me a little leary.  IMO, Innova EVO is the absolute best commercial brand, very closely followed by Wellness.  The link below lists several great grain-free commercial food options.    http://catinfo.org/commercialcannedfoods...|`|AA10859773	Best is very subjective.

5M5BFB5Caa	There are so many possibilities and without a better description it's going to be hard to get any insight.  The best idea is to bring the cat to the vet, especially if these bumps look irritated or change in size.|`|EyOzAeyraa	They might be small tumors or cysts, so you should take him to the vet and he might have to go through a small surgery.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	a Vet call tell you.|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	breast cancer|`|iYzmnIsJaa	Take this cat to a vet.
45N6tmWraa	Age, weight (maybe you have a kitchen scale, but don't use the one your mom uses for food!), color.  Pulse rate and respiratory rate are good, if you can get them.  It's hard on little animals because they are usually so rapid.  Count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get the rate per minute.

There are also emergency vets. If you tell me what city you are in, I will even help you find a vet that is open. Kittens that young need to eat like every 2 hours or something. You need to consult a vet IMMEDIATELY. At least just call and ask them what to do. If you don't get that kitten eating kitten formula, it will die too. Do not feed it milk from your fridge. That's actually bad for cats and gives them diarrhea, which will dehydrate the kitten even more, and most likely kill him/her.    If you need help, please feel free to email me at hotassmaymay@yahoo.com
Xr5bU3t1aa	Yes, you can feed them dry and wet, just not in the same bowls.  Wet food will become contaminated with bacteria if left out for several hours and can lead to stomach upset or worse, food poisioning for your cat... besides, it makes the dry food very mushy.  I leave dry food out for my 7 cats 24/7, and feed them 3 very small feedings of wet food a day.|`|WqGxGJkbaa	There is no problem with doing this if your cat likes it that way.  However, you might find that after a short while the dry food swells and goes soggy in the wet food (unfortunately this is what happens in their stomachs and is the reason why a completely dry diet is bad for cats - it is packed with fillers to make them feel full more quickly).      If your cat eats  most of its food in one go then this should be no problem but it wont be nice if it is left down for long periods.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I recommend keeping them separate.  Dry food actually contains quite a bit of bacteria.  It's okay for them to eat it, but moistening it by mixing in the wet provides an ideal breeding ground for all the bacteria in the dry food.  Doing so can cause the dry food to become unhealthy in a hurry.      Also, Whiskas is actually one of the lowest quality foods on the market.  It's loaded with grains, carbs and by-products.  I recommend that you consider a high protein, grain free wet food like Innova EVO or Wellness.  Both are excellent quality foods that contain everything that an obligate carnivore (cat) needs.  The article linked below has more information on cat nutrition and explains why a species appropriate diet is so important.  It's a long article, but one that's well worth reading if you're interested in achieving long-term good health for your cat.  http://catinfo.org|`|Sru8JnBBaa	Stop feeding your cat junk food. Your giving kitty the equivalent of McDonald's every day, wet or dry. Ask your vet, or a vet, what you should be feeding kitty, then take the vet's advice. If they say Whiskas is fine, ask another vet.|`|AA10859773	It's perfectly fine to feed both canned food and dry food.  It's perfectly ok to use different flavors and different brands.    The two things I would NOT do is mix canned and dry together - unless the cat eats it all up or you toss anything that isn't eaten.  It can be very very bad to get dry food wet.  After a certain period of time, it's going to activate bacteria and then you'll have a bowl of germs which will make your cat sick.  But if you toss anything left over, then it would be ok.    The second thing I wouldn't do is feed Whiskas.  It contains a carcinogen (BHA/BHT).  This is present in ALL its foods whether wet or dry.    I highly recommend you choose anything else to feed your cat.    CORRECTION:  BHA/BHT is not a carcinogen (ethoxyquin is) but it's still very undesirable to find in cat food.|`|01f954e00f6c128ad0a0d25eee94e023aa	Yes it's okay to mix the two together. ive done this in the past with my cats to stretch a can of food. they ate it right up.|`|QQXMcit7aa	yes you can mix the foods. since you aren't completely changing the type of food too drastically your cat shouldn't have a bad reaction. don't leave the food sit out for too long like you can with dry food, it can grow bacteria. Some cats are picky, if he/she doesn't eat it go back to how you used to do it. if you are thinking of changing the type of food you are giving do it gradually. add a spoonful or two to the original food and taking the same amount of the old food out each day gradually increasing the new type, until you have completely switched.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	you want to be feeding your cat a better food.  switch to wellness.  I give my cats wellness and they love it, I give them 3 meals a day of dry food, on occation for a treat I will give them some wet food and then use that in place of one of the dry meals.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	We feed one meal of dry, one meal of canned.  You can vary the canned food flavors every day, but not with dry - dry has to be changed gradually or your cat will probably throw up or have loose stools.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Your cat will be the one to actually make the decision whether to accept it or not.  However, while you can leave dry kibble out, you really don't want to leave wet food out for more than a couple of hours.  So if you mix the food, you will have to toss what is not eaten after several hours.  The reason is that the food will spoil.    Perhaps a better approach would be to leave out two bowls. One with dry kibble, and the other with the wet food.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Cats generally don't like their food mixed together.  If you want to offer both wet and dry food that would be fine, but do it in two separate bowls.  Uneaten wet food really needs to be picked up and discarded (ie thrown away) after about an hour or so anyway because it is so moist and a great environment for bacteria to grow.  It can't be left out 24/7 the way dry food can.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Perfectly fine to mix the food up.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Why would you? Cats don't need dry food. In fact, contrary to popular belief, wet/canned food is healthiest for them.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.      Also, Whiskas is a /terrible/ food to be feeding. It's an extremely low quality cat food.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    A|`|nsBxgXI1aa	i give my kitties a choice they get a bowl of dry and a seperate bowl of wet food felix wet food and plenty of water|`|435c271Kaa	It is completly fine and safe to do this.|`|19L99wvCaa	You can mix them together, and brand does not matter.

8twI4Ufraa	Yeah, definitely dont punish him. It is a submissive move, like someone else said. Little dogs are known for this. One idea is to ignore him until he calms down- don't look or talk to him, and when you do go to pet him, don't bend down over the dog because this is a dominant move, get down on his level and let him come to you. Might help, might not! Depends on the dog. Obedience classes would be a good idea for confidence.|`|GaL66jbQaa	it's a submissive thing and you hitting him for it will actually make it worse.  you need to build his confidence with obedience classes and socialization both in and out of the house.|`|GNq2rmrNaa	you shouldn't punish him, it's just a submissive move that's all|`|76nTvO4iaa	It's called submissive urination.

The stone would heat better with an overhead heat source like a lamp or a heat emitter that goes into a lamps socket.<br>  <br>  Personally I would not recommend an under tank heater to anyone or any type of "rock heater" because there have been to many shorts or accidents with water spills and in my opinion as well as others in the same field proper overhead heating is generally best and safer.  But if it is working for you and your on a limited budget then you should be fine either way as long as the temp stays good and there are at least two zones in your tank. One for basking (high temp) and one where they can get off the heat or out of the heat if needed depending on the type of animal you are keeping.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you,<br>  Rusty aka Abilifys

I would personally say that a Betta would be better in a 3-5 gallon but they have been housed in much much less and been fine.<br>  <br>  As for the filter, NOT needed unless you want to add one but a water change with RO, Carbon filtered and treated tap water water 50% water changes once a week is fine for a Betta, they are very hardy but would also just like some nice water. :)<br>  <br>  The heater is NEEDED.  You must make sure the temp is about 78 at all times for the fish to be healthy.  <br>  <br>  Generally they don't need much to be "happy" but whatever you can give them is great for any animal.|`|1182ec398d423c1acb6f2f36d9d90472aa	Betta fish don't even need the filter, just leaving water sitting out for 24 hours so the Chlorine escapes it is good.  They don't get their oxygen from the water, they are actually air breathers, which is why you'll see the little air bubbles accumulate at the top of the fish bowl.  However I do like seeing that you're considering keeping the water a steady temperature, they're usually fine at a room temperature of 65 to 75 degrees.<br>  <br>  I think your Betta will be fine in that tank, in fact, it's probably a little overkill.  They are pretty private creatures, and don't like interacting with other creatures that well.  It won't think its too small at all, if anything, you are giving it too much room.
Jg0DLlPWaa	My cat developed an food allergy to a ingredient in her cat food.It is the same crap that killed thousands of cats and dogs from China. WHEAT GLUTEN! My cat was always at the vet and all they did was take my money. She had patches all over her body from itching, and a friend of mine clued me in. I stopped feeding her the dry food, and gave her little Friskies in the can that did not have this ingredient in it. She was fine after that.DAM vets, never told me about  possible allergies.|`|5uLDqE0maa	I would get a second opinion. There are plenty of other problems that can cause itching and scratching. Unfortunately, cats can be difficult to diagnose, especially because behavior can be part of the issue. Food allergies should be high on the list of possibilities, but I have also seen cats that are truly obsessive compulsive and need mood altering medications to control the problem. Many of them stop scratching when the medication is given. But you do need to make sure that whatever the treatment, you're not just treating symptoms (ex: creams to stop itching). You need to stop the source of the problem. If your veterinarian is not willing to look further, you may want to consult a dermatologist or a veterinarian who enjoys working specifically with cats.|`|5M5BFB5Caa	Do you put a flea collar or topical flea medication in the area that she's scratching?  A lot of cats have allergic reactions to flea medications, especially if they are Hartz brand.  If not, it could be some other contact allergy, perhaps from her normal collar if she has one.  Food allergies usually cause all-over itching but if you've changed foods lately that could also be the culprit.  Try switching things up or get a second opinion from another veterinarian.  Also, many veterinarians offer a fantastic but costly allergy testing profile now that can tell you exactly what your pet is allergic to down to the types of grass or material.  That may be something to think about.  Good luck.|`|FT8tyqYlaa	She may have an allergy problem.

5nSVdasNaa	She is a bit sickle-hocked. I'm not loving the looong length of her back, and her shoulder is a little steep, which restricts her movement.

I think she is gorgeous personally!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|t65X0EXHaa	I think that she is a cute horse, and would be a good potential for jumping....she is only 3 yrs old so you would have to wait before you do anything big on her, mostly training would be the best, and she is most likely still growing so she may fill out more, along with a good workout too!!! I wouldnt say she has amazing conformation, but it is hard to tell by looking at a picture...I suggest that you go see her in person, and you have a trainer or if you know someone else who knows a whole lot about jumping, take them along to check her out. <br>  <br>  hope that helps<br>  good luck...!|`|wtOPy7QWaa	I hate to say it but she does not look like she is 15.3.

Shes built very downhill, which might not go over well in the hunters, but if she can jump than it doesn't really matter in jumpers. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cZGnqPhMaa	She looks fine but I wouldnt blame her lacking muscle tone on her age. My horse is almost 2 and she has great muscle tone. It has to do with how they are working the horse.|`|1gu71eYNaa	i think she looks pretty good. you should email the owners and ask if they have a video you could see of her. whenever i am looking for a horse my trainer always takes me out to ride the horse. also before you purchase the horse make sure you have the vet come out and do a full examination on her, just to make sure everything is healthy. hope everything works out!|`|RogGmYUCaa	She looks like a good horse, also she looks like she'd be good at the events that you are interested in.  Looks like a good buy!|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Looks like a really nice horse!<br>  Ask them if she interferes at all.

A male angelfish getting ready to mate has quite a sex organ for it's size and in the golden breed it may be quite red , Another possibility is the blood worms you should always let them get to room temperature before feeding them to fish.|`|tDUXX7T6aa	Most fish waste is a red tube, but if it was recently fed blood worms that is most likely the reason. If he looks lethargic and stops eating than you have to worry.|`|6gB6AAoyaa	im not sure but it may just mean it wants to mate|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	Sounds like it could be pooping.

6SeWCfUfaa	I would go with the corgie.<br>  <br>  Reason, Greyhounds will be mellow in the house and need a good run everyday, but most the rest of the time, they'll be snoozing.  Truly about 90% of your greyhounds day will consist of finding the most comfy spot and sleeping.  Greyhounds are also not very easy to train.  And I don't mean house training or anything like that, but if you want to do anything with your dog besides take it for walks, runs and watch it sleep - greyhounds are not a great choice.<br>  <br>  Corgies - are so trainable.  They're herding dogs with the same kind of smarts as border collies without all the high activity needs.  They will learn to fetch a ball.  They will learn some fun tricks.  They will have cute little antics and and habits that most greyhounds don't.  In other words - forgive me for saying this - they'll have a personality.<br>  <br>  And yes, greyhounds have personalities but they are never the kinds of characters that corgies are.  Corgies really are neat, neat versitile dogs. <br>  <br>  That's my call.  Hope it helps.|`|JsBb732Maa	I haven't had either dog but I would love to have a greyhound :-) But I do know that Corgis are a herding breed and are very active. I've heard that greyhounds are great couch potatoes most of the time.|`|AA11887983	I would probably go with the greyhound.  They seem to be much more laid back, and would probably not mind napping while you are gone.  Corgis seem to be a bit more active, and need more exercise.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	I'd say go for the greyhound. <br>  I've met many retired greyhounds that have been absolutely fine in apartments.

Corgis are very active working dogs and they bark much more than greyhounds.  They shed more too.  Greyhounds make lovely apartment dogs, shed very little and are not big barkers at all.  They need a nice walk every day and are happy - the rest of the time they are relaxed easy going dogs.  Given your lifestyle, I think you are a greyhound person.|`|psLk5fDGaa	Greyhounds. Greyhounds are awesome dogs and they're people stoppers on the street. Even better would be to adopt one from a retired dog racing facility.|`|crlXvjXOaa	Greyhound..

Corgis are very high-energy dogs. Many of them are barkers. An older Corgi might fit the bill, say one over 7 or 8, but otherwise they tend to be very active and I have seen very few that didn't bark at every noise. They were used as all purpose farm dogs in Wales, so alerting the farmer to potential problems was one of their jobs. And they do it well.<br>  <br>  I have friends in Greyhound Rescue, and I would go with a retired Greyhound. They are sweet, calm, mellow couch potato dogs. One friend remarked that her retired Greyhounds rarely even run. She said it is almost like they have run enough and are ready to just kick back and take life easy.|`|46ZTMzheaa	I haven't had any problems with my greyhound.|`|TCohQ81Zaa	As the President of Greyhound Pets of America - Montgomery Chapter, I have to ask if your prepared for a greyhound's unique needs?  With a Greyhound you have to take control of their veterinarian care. Many vets will tell you they are familiar with a greyhound, but this isn't always the case. Most vets are familiar with Greyhounds to the extent of they are dogs. <br>  <br>  A Greyhounds blood work is very different from any other breed of dog and you have to know what the normals values are for a greyhound. As stated before a greyhound has very different blood values and most vets are not familiar with a greyhound's very unique blood chemistry. Do you have a greyhound saavy vet in the area?<br>  <br>  Greyhounds are very chemically sensitive. You can only use approved flea and tick medications failure to do so can lead to the death of a greyhound. You have to be very careful about which pesticides the greyhounds come into contact with. As you live in an apartment are you sure that you can get the grounds staff to spray with a pesticide spray that is greyhound safe? Greyhounds are very sensitive to organophosphates. <br>  <br>  Let's look at something else. You live in an apartment greyhounds can be as small as 40 lbs and as large as 100 lbs, The average for a greyhound female is 65 to 70lb and the average for a male is 75 to 80 lbs. Do you have a weight limit? <br>  <br>  As most of the NGA greyhounds were professional athletes they will become arthritic over time. If you have to climb stairs how do you plan to handle an aging greyhound? What about an old injury acting up can you carry a greyhound down the stairs if required?  <br>  <br>  I love the greyhounds and they can and do make wonderful pets. We have placed greyhounds into apartments. I just want to make sure you have considered everything that encompasses owning a greyhound. They are wonderful dogs and very unique in their needs.|`|b0e6kiC5aa	I have bred Pembroke Welsh corgis for over 22 years. They are great dogs but.....pretty active and they are more on the noiser side. Now an older Corgi would be and should be fine if you are interested in getting one over 2 or 3 years old.<br>  <br>  I now have two Greyhounds and I adore them, They are quiet and love to lay around. I was working and gone for 6 hours a day. I did have some issues with separation anxiety sooooooo that could and may be a problem and it can take a short time to help them get over it and then there are longer hauls and some not at all. I bought a CD for dogs anxiety that you play while you are gone. I got it from the humane society. I also bought an herbal defuser and I use them together on my training of getting my dog to relax. I have several issues and then things became fine and now they are great and this particular Greyhound I have had 6 mos. now. I have a male and a femal and love them both.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your choice.<br>  <br>  Judy|`|cMFOAngVaa	As a Greyhound owner and volunteer foster - I'd have to say Greyhound, hands down! :)<br>  <br>  They do make great apartment dogs, so long as the apartment complex management is okay with whatever size dog you get. Greyhounds typically are VERY well-mannered indoors, and highly social. Your time frame out of the house should work very well with the crate time of your Greyhound, should you choose that breed. Just remember the leash rule: Leash on EVERY time you go outdoors in an unenclosed/unfenced area. They will run, and not every Greyhound, unlike mine, will come back when called. (I have had this happen before! Thankfully I was able to recover the dog within minutes - Thank God for the Greyhound's need to potty for a long time! LOL). With that being said, you sound like a perfect home for a Greyhound companion! Plus, you'll be saving a dog's life - literally!!!
AA10270018	Of course, you still need to remove the chlorine in tap water.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You should always use water conditioner.|`|fboC1N7gaa	Yes. Aguasafe makes tapwater safe for the fish and the filter keeps the water clean.|`|tDUXX7T6aa	Always condition your water even if it is r/o water. The filtering processed water is safe for us to drink but some chemicals and minerals are very unsafe for fish. And also, if it is a goldfish than it needs 10 tank and needs it changed oftern goldfish are dirty ammonia ridden fish.|`|ivhnVbbraa	If you're using tap water to fill it, then yes. Usually city tap water contains chlorine which is deadly to fish. Water conditioners like AquaSafe will remove most of the chlorine.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Tap water- yes<br>  Bottled water- no
bDPVRtCNaa	Four in what? A tank, bowl?<br>  <br>  -For a properly stocked aquarium weekly partial water changes of about 25% are fine.<br>  -For an overstocked aquarium I would do 25% water changes twice weekly.<br>  -For a bowl...I'd throw it away and buy a tank. Daily partial water changes.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Depends on the size of your tank, usually 20% weekly changes.|`|qU8HqQsOaa	1nce a week I used 2 do that when I had 1 in a 4
YdjX5fOWaa	I'm afraid they are not hypoallergenic.  They are supposed to be low shedding dogs, but I think that also depends on their grooming regiment as well.  They are terrific dogs though.|`|d6xTrRDTaa	There is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog.|`|XMnyOT8Yaa	No, they are not. They shed like every other dog and there are no 100% hypoallergenic dogs. There are dogs that are better suited to allergy sufferers, since they shed less or have no dander.     http://www.k9ring.com - Dog Breeders Online Community|`|FewhKlx9aa	No they shed so they can't be..A dog that does'nt shed is hypoallergenic,poodle,brussles griffon,yorkie

50WCN0graa	Did your dog actually bite him? People can file a law suit any time they want, however, if your dog didn't bite him then I don't think the mailman would win the case. It would have to be a pretty substantial scratch for the mailman to have a case that could win.... the court would probably want pictures of the injury if there was one. If the mail man has no proof the he was injured (doctor testimony, pictures, etc), I don't see how he could win. When you sue someone else, it is your responsibility to prove your case to the court. If he wasn't injured, he has no case and won't win.... don't worry, I highly, highly doubt he would win a case for a little scratch.<br>  <br>  It is strange that the mailman rang the doorbell... especially if you didn't have to sign for anything. I think you have this going for you in terms of your defense.<br>  <br>  Sorry about this. I know I would be heartbroken if I were in this situation. Best Wishes!|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Normally if it's the only time your dog has bitten someone they won't just immediately have him put down.  Signs that are posted to keep people away because of a dog aren't a reason not to get sued.  If you have a sign like that up then you know your dog is a problem, so does your dad if he lives there, and the door NEVER should have been opened without the dog under control or restrained, crated.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Your question made very little sense.<br>  <br>  Did your dog physically bite him? If so, then there's nothing you can do. If the mailman is two feet from the doorway, he is on your property. But why does that matter? If your dog was on a leash it wouldn't matter so much. Then again, why do you let your dog do that to visitors?<br>  <br>  I can't give you a thorough answer because I honestly didn't understand what you were saying but you can fight being sued. I don't think dogs get put to sleep after their first bite. You only pay a fine. I think it's the second or third where they're put to sleep.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck|`|qqUvoC5uaa	It depends on the laws where you live. <br>  Where I am from a Beware of Dog sign basically lifts the liability if the person is on the property. <br>  Permitting the dog was on the property. I am unsure of the size of your property. If the dog was on the front lawn or driveway, then it was still your property.<br>  <br>  Here's an excerpt from <a href="http://doglaw.hugpug.com/doglaw_082.html" rel="nofollow">http://doglaw.hugpug.com/doglaw_082.html</a><br>  Someone who ignores a clear, prominently posted "Beware of Dog" sign is probably not going to be able to blame the dog's owner for any injuries. For example, a Maryland delivery man ignored a "Guard Dog on Duty" sign at a warehouse and was severely bitten by a German shepherd that most definitely was on duty. He sued but lost. A court concluded that he "voluntarily left his place of safety" and knowingly took the risk of injury.|`|7vJNHaskaa	2 feet from your doorway is still on your property, and it doesn't matter that he rang the doorbell or if the mail wasn't yours, it could've been a random stranger that came to your door to ask you something. I don't think your dog will be put to sleep because if I understood correctly, the bite doesn't sound bad at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|psLk5fDGaa	I'm not sure what the laws are in California but it's rare that a dog would be put down for its first offense. This happened to us with our garbage man but we got so afraid that we paid him off so he wouldn't press charges. The best advice I can give you is that you should negotiate with him outside of court and see if you can come to an agreement.|`|a3R1NxH5aa	well i hope your dog doesn't but if you have to go to court you should bring up that and i think he was still on your property i don't think your dog should be put to sleep though its not like his leg or arm tore off but good luck i really hope nothing happens to your dog|`|nd30LQhlaa	I dont know..I hope it works out for you though...if you had a beware of dog sign then you should have a case! Good luck!|`|Ii2rD9sOaa	I agree with my checke|`|CEgq26oHaa	I had a shepard & timberwolf mix dog years ago that bit someone on the ankle.  Thankfully they didn't sue us but they did want us to pay their medical bills.  Which we certainly did because we felt it was our obligation to do so. The dog did not pierce her skin, just left a bruise.  And a few years after that my son was attacked in the head by a neighbors chow chow.  In both cases, the dogs had to be quarantined for 10 days.  Where I lived at the time, they had to be quarantined in your home.  <br>  <br>  I think it really depends on your state and the type of dog you own.  I highly doubt they will put a dachshund down for this being his first time and he is not really considered a vicious breed.  If you had a pitbull on the other hand, they'd probably remove it from the home because that is how they react when they hear the word pitbull.  <br>  <br>  If all the dog did is scratch the mail carrier, I don't think he will get very much out of suing you.  Maybe if he went to the doctors, you would be required to pay medical bills, but I don't believe you will have to put your dog down.|`|YBYnZlP8aa	Dog bite law varies from State to State.  There is an article on eHow - How to Understand Dog Bite Law - that discussed this in depth.  i suggest starting your research there.  There is a link to the law in each states.  The article states the following:<br>  <br>  The first step to understanding the law pertaining to a dog bite is to determine if your state has a specific animal liability statute. The States are split in their law concerning dog bites. The first legal category pertains to the States who hold to the common law doctrine of the "one bite" rule. The rule essentially means that the dog owner must have knowledge of a vicious nature of the dog before the owner can be held liable for any resulting personal injury. If the bite is indeed the first, there likely is no liability on the part of the owner. <br>  <br>  Other States have nullified the "one bite" rule. These States impose a standard of strict liability for the dog owner. The law generally states that the owner is liable for the personal injury caused by a dog, regardless of the owner's knowledge of any viciousness. In these cases, even if Fluffy was the sweetest dog on the block, if she bites you there is a valid case to recover damages. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|76nTvO4iaa	WHO is suing you?  The post office, the delivery service, the mailman as an individual?<br>  <br>  Your dad needs to call his home owner's insurance company now and tell them about this.  They will tell him what to do & may even handle the issue for him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:<br>  <br>  If this happened while the mail carrier was on duty, his "injury" would be covered by workmen's comp and he should have no reason to be suing you.<br>  <br>  Call the homeowner's insurance company!  Tomorrow!|`|JsBb732Maa	If anything the dog will have to be put in isolation for a certain amount of days because if the bite. If it's the first bite he should not be put to sleep.A lawyer talked to my dog club and said that the beware of dog sign is a bad idea because it gives the impression that you know your dog will/might bite. That was a surprise to me, I've always had a sign up.
fboC1N7gaa	Invest in a hepa filter. Keep it on while she visits. I've had people with serious cat allergies over and they have little to no reactions with the air filter on. Iq air is a really good brand. The filters are quiet but work very well.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Brushing the cat is good......also you can wipe it down with a damp cloth right before the cousin comes over.....but, SHE may need to take some allergy medication before she comes, anyway ( cousin, I mean ).  <br>  <br>  There are some good ones available......Zyrtec, Clariton, etc. and some of them have "no doze" options.......others will put you to sleep!  Need to check the label for warnings.<br>  <br>  Don't try to "doctor" the CAT........have your cousin get the medicine for herself!  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps......Good luck finding the "right" cat for YOU........|`|Nj36OUPFaa	She can take allergy medication while she is there that will help. <br>  Also when i was a child i was very allergic to cats and dogs i would break out with hives, get runny a noes and watery eyes, I just recently got a cat and a dog and for the 1st 2-3 weeks the allergy's were bad but now they have gone.

5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	get her to the vet to be spayed right away|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It doesn't take much to get a cat pregnant - a few minutes left outside will do it. You definitely need to have her spayed ASAP. You can still get her spayed even if she's pregnant. Be a responsible pet owner and make an appointment with your vet, like today. Or take her to a shelter where she will be taken care of.|`|435c271Kaa	It is hard to tell with cats. Either take her to the vet, or wait and feel her belly after a few weeks.|`|AA11625368	Keep an eye on her for the next 2 months. If you don't want kittens, call your vet about having her spayed. She will remain in heat until she is bred. Also, cats can go into spontaneous estrus cycles. So, if she is not bred this time, she will continuously go into heat until she is bred or spayed. Also, after she has her litter, while still  nursing, she may go into heat again. Good luck!|`|sqbuYfJQaa	It's kinda difficult to tell right away unless you take her to the vet. I see alot of pregnant strays that roam in my area and it's obvious that some are pregnant because their belly's are bigger than than normal. If you don't want kittens, you should take her to get spayed regardless if she has been outside a few times.|`|Sru8JnBBaa	Kitty will start craving weird things like pickles and ice cream, and probably start being really moody for awhile.|`|HAT8jivxaa	check her tummy every now and then for kicks.|`|LvJyrN2daa	Well if your cat went into heat and you let her out with males in the yard more than likely she is pregnant. But the way i could tell is if she stopped her meowing and ridiculous behavior that she had when she was in heat. When she's pregnant those behaviors will stop. Also her belly will be gettin big pretty soon.|`|LikrEW7Zaa	I'd keep an eye on her. Feel of her stomach.      Good Luck!! ;)|`|YzXuJOqUaa	Usually about two days before giving birth your cat's nipples will increase in size and she will begin producing milk. Your cat's temperature will decrease to about 99 degrees F and you may notice a drop in her appetite.   She may become restless and begin nesting in earnest. She may follow you around and become very affectionate or pace from room to room. Other signs are that she may begin purring, meowing, panting, licking her genitals and she may vomit. You may notice a vaginal discharge and eventually contractions. Not all signs apply to all cats.

50WCN0graa	Your brother is right. Bathing them everyday depletes their skin of essential oils. You really shouldn't even wash him weekly (unless he needs it). We usually wash our dog once a month (sometimes more if he gets real dirty or goes swimming, sometimes less if he has stayed relatively clean).|`|3zv2bbolaa	It is very drying to the skin and coat, as bathing strips away natural protective body oils the dog needs to keep skin and hair healthy.|`|eDySIDPQaa	It is bad to do it, it removes the natural oils from the coat and skin,,they will develop such dry skin, it will become flaky and the coat will get very dull.<br>  <br>  Dogs should not be bathed often..it is very drying.....unless dog gets really dirty or bad stinky, just brush out and use dry dog shampoo to spruce the dog up but don't use it too often either......bathe only every couple of months, unless is a show dog......or only if gets really messed up......|`|T1RZFeXJaa	yes....<br>  it can dry out the natural oils in their coat which helps it stay healthy and can also lead to skin rash and irritation.<br>  <br>  when i first got my puppy i was told every 2 weeks was a good time period between washes.|`|YxGyd2yZaa	-Your brother is correct. Bathing a dog everyday, even every week, is irritating to their skin. I would suggest maybe once or twice a month.|`|DOoHDBTiaa	Yeah it is.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Your brother is ABSOLUTELY right. 100% right. Unless the dog is being shown there is no reason to bather a dog more than every few months unless he rolls in something like cow manure. It is very very bad for the puppies skin.|`|mJUf5cnYaa	Over bathing can cause the dog to have dry skin, and remove there natural oils. Dogs only need to be bathed every couple of weeks or so. In between baths, you can use wipes to remove excess dirt.|`|48EwTYV6aa	Yes, I'd bathe them maybe once a week if you want the cleanest dog you can have. Dogs need the oils on their body to not make them so itchy. The more you wash, the more you'll notice dandruff.|`|jO4BsfbMaa	Don't bathe a dog too often - it leaves the skin unprotected by natural oils, leaving it too dry and open to rashes and infection.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Your brother is correct.  You will strip all the natural oils from the skin and coat and cause dryness and itching.|`|Do2pJx8Aaa	Its very bad indeed. A dog really only needs to be bathed at most 2x a month.|`|OrvTG44laa	yes, you're washing away natural oils.  They will smell worse.  I think it's hard on their skin too.|`|pjrPYAasaa	yeah kinda..... 1x per week  should be good.... and less traumatizing....|`|XG7zVTIsaa	Yes.. you are striping the natural oils from the dog.. Has the dog got an odour? or flea strike?<br>  <br>  If you are worried about an odour, then try using a scented dog wash.. If it is flea strike then get a good quality flea control spray from the vet or use Advantage flea control.. flea collars do not work well|`|BtEMrUFUaa	yes it is bad it takes away natural oils just like if you washed your hair everyday.   and to get a clean dog brush him/her everyday and keep him/her well groomed|`|LRPn5ykzaa	yes, because it does dry out the skin

You can talk to your vet about Acyclovir which is an anti viral drug.  Unfortunately the prognosis for puppy's born with or who contract herpes virus within the first 3 weeks is poor.  Here is a link to some information that may help you.  I wish you the best for you and your puppy's.<br>  Are you sure it wasn't puppy strangles?<br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/puppy-strangles/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/puppy-stran...</a>|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	It really does depend on the age of the puppies.  There is little hope if they are under 3 weeks of age.<br>  <br>  I have a puppy, now 11 months, which apparently contracted this virus, according to my Vet.  I don't know how old he was when he contracted it but he has been permanently affected.  Luckily this isn't severe, he has intention tremors (cerebellar hypoplasia) and his head shakes for a few seconds when he is looking at something intently.  He got out of it lightly, thank God.<br>  <br>  Just try whatever the Vet suggests and do some research online.  I wish you all the best.|`|JsBb732Maa	<a href="http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_canine_herpes_infection.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_can...</a>  I hope that you can save the other puppies, good luck.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Currently there is no specific treatment for canine herpes. All treatment is aimed at supportive care. Older puppies can be force-fed and treated with anti-diarrheal medication. The survival rate of puppies less than three weeks old is poor. Severely infected puppies will die rapidly. The remaining puppies should be kept warm (100oF) until the virus has run its course. It is hoped that a vaccination will be developed to protect against this disease.<br>  <br>  As a preventive practice, one should make sure the environmental temperature of the puppies is kept warm with whelping boxes, heat lamps, etc.|`|AA11887983	How old are the puppies?  If they are already exposed, which is sounds like they are, then there is probably nothing that can be done.  If the ***** is exposed to herpes virus within the last 3 weeks of gestation, or the pups within the first 3 weeks of life, there is a high risk of loss of pups.  The best thing to do is just keep them and mom separate from other dogs, especially any other pregnant dogs.  You may lose all of the pups.  I am very sorry.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Okay, your vet said that the Herpes caused the pups death, this is most unlikely, in all the years working with dogs and I am a shelter volunteer for 13 yrs, I have never seen this kill one dog not even a new pup.<br>  <br>  It can only be treated with an RX Medication prescribed by your vet, so if he did not give meds, then you need a second opinion, and the Herpes virus in dogs 9 of 10 cases is in and around the eyes, hoever can develop on the rest of the body.<br>  <br>  To back this up, before answering your post blind and to be sure of the facts, I called 8 vets and 4 are from my shelter, 1 is my personal vet and 3 are 24/7 er vet clinics, all say the said the same above that I did,.,,,,,it is most unlikely that the dog died from Herpes....<br>  <br>  And if your vet did not prescribe meds to cure it, then you need a 2nd opinion of the diagnosis, it may not be herpes at all per all 8 vets.<br>  <br>  Our biggest 24/7 ER VET clinic in Dallas/Ft. Worth, said they always keep the dog or dogs for a couple of days to make sure it is under control and won't spread to any other pets in the household...so again, if your vet sent home and no meds, you really need another vets opinion,<br>  <br>  It can spread to other parts of the body, however, it is mostly in dogs in and around the eyes of any age dog.<br>  <br>  hope your pups get well soon.....and hope you get a second opinion, if you need help in talking to the big clinic here, email me and I will gladly give you the number....a vet is on duty and I just spoke to them about the herpes virus.......<br>  <br>  all vets said, they seriously doubt the dog died from herpes, this is not something that happens with this virus.,,unless is born with it =, but can be saved if all precautions are taken, keep away from all other dogs, keep warm, fed correctly, but has to be on antibiotics.....<br>  <br>  we have an excellent team of vets at shelter and they have saved even newborns with it....but, I have never seen a pup die from it yet....but can happen.....<br>  <br>  good luck|`|tmckNa4baa	AWWH THATS SOOO SAD! :'( I dont know how but I wish u the best of luck! =D =P|`|bp41vdbPaa	all i know is that if a human has herpes and then gives birth normally to their child it can cause blindness and in most cases death. If you knew befor you could have had you dog have a cesarean section, but i dont think you can do anything now. im sorry. :(|`|69aae2afc5ec35c06042c874dc59e82faa	Survival of the fittest,do the right thing euthanize them, or you can let them suffer a long and painful life and infect other puppies|`|3rCvC4eMaa	all you can do is supportive therapy.  breathing treatments, fluids and anti-biotics, with prednisone.|`|XNxFBrbAaa	i am not sure if there is one.....did you let the male around the pups a lot?..i heard that when males sniff at the newborns thats how they can contract it...but again i am not sure of a cure...sorry|`|SUlkDzn3aa	LOL.. There is an ad with a lady kissing her puppy on the right.|`|zSpFXIrfaa	theres no cure :(
nBehRANyaa	My dog developed severe separation anxiety after our last move.  Here are some things that helped us get past it:<br>  <br>  - In general, make your comings and goings as calm and matter-of-fact as possible.  Pretend you're just stepping out to get the mail.<br>  <br>  - If the dog begins getting anxious while you're getting ready to go, try putting her outside (if you have a fenced yard), or in another room until it's time to leave.  My dog would work herself into a frenzy just watching us get ready to go somewhere.  She was so much better if she just couldn't see us.<br>  <br>  - Put coats, purses, keys, etc. in the car or outside the door ahead of time, so the dog isn't seeing you gather up all your stuff. <br>  <br>  - When you're ready to leave, have the dog lie on her bed, give her a treat, say 'be right back!' in a cheerful voice, and immediately head out the door.<br>  <br>  - Leave through a different door than you usually use.  My dog would freak out when we left through the garage door, but was less anxious if we used the front or back doors.  Note: This and some of the other suggestions aren't a matter of sneaking out or tiptoeing around the dog, but of temporarily avoiding the things that are most likely to trigger the dog's anxiety.  Think about the things that seem to trigger your dog's anxiety and see if you can find ways to do things a bit differently.  Once the dog is more secure about being left alone, you can gradually go back to your normal leaving routine.<br>  <br>  - When you come back in, *completely* ignore the dog for at least a few minutes.  Once she's calm, have her sit, give her a pat and say hello, and then go about your business.  You're trying to convey that your absence was no big deal, so don't make it a big deal with a prolonged greeting, or frustration when you see the mess she's made.<br>  <br>  - You can try leaving a tv or radio on.  This didn't do much for my dog, but it works well for some.<br>  <br>  - If she's been crated in the past and is okay with it, consider going back to crating for a while.<br>  <br>  - Talk with your vet about anti-anxiety medication.  It can really help you and your dog get past this.<br>  <br>  - Make sure your dog is getting enough exercise and training.  It will tire her out and reinforce your leadership, which will help her to better accept being left alone.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Do you leave the tv on for her during the day when you are gone?  I found that this really helped my dog.  I videoed him while I was gone to see what he would do - once with the tv on and once with it off.    When the TV was on , he would do one sweep of the house, then go and lay down by the door and sleep. Without the tv on, he went from door to door, room to room, window to window, and would sit and whine and cry the entire time I was gone. So now whenever I leave him alone, I make sure the TV is left on for him.  I also recently got a tape that was made especially for dog with soothing music for them.  I play this while traveling with him in the car and it does seem to relax him a lot.  I believe the tape is called Music for your Pets or something like that.   I got it on Amazon.com.|`|AA10265922	DOES NOT SOUND AS THOUGH YOU ARE LEAVING ENOUGH 'ICE WATER' FOR HER WHEN YOU LEAVE|`|psLk5fDGaa	She is probably freaked out by the new surroundings and will need some time to acclimate.

dMIoDfl4aa	I have been breeding guinea pigs professionally for around 5 years. I have bred hundreds of guinea pigs (all of which went to good homes of course). What yuor guinea pig is experiencing is completley normal. She is just stressed- this is more common in first time mothers. Taking her to the vet would only cause her to become more stressed- plus there are very few vest who are specialised in guines pigs. They only know basic information about rodents. The situation should rectify itself within a few days. <br>  If it does not then your guine pig may have mites. This is not realy a big deal. You simply need to purchase some IVOMEC.|`|jiZ6WD04aa	She might be trying to reach her vagina. if yah no what im sayin. Its normal i guess my guinea pig did it when she had her babies it stoped after a week or so. i never took her to the vet and shes fine.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	No this is not normal it is a pain response, please take her to a vet ASAP.<br>   Unless the cage is in real bad condition i would not bother her tonight, just add a little fresh bedding on top of what is in there and change her tomorrow before you put her back after taking her to a vet. Remember you need to find a vet that specializes in exotics as they are the only ones that understand guinea pigs.Guinea pigs are very fragile and can not be treated as you would treat a cat or a dog.They can only tolerate a very few antibiotics and as well as other medications
TdrgZwnoaa	My one cat stares out the window because she has not been out of the house for the last four months and she is getting 'cabin fever'. "Noel" was attacked by a fox or coyote in late October and almost lost a leg due to infection. And little 'Thomas' has not been out since we rescued him from -40F weather so he has no great desire to go out. He just sits in the window to keep "Noel" company.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Things ( people, cars, squirrels, birds, other animals, leaves, etc ) are all moving around outside the window.<br>  <br>  What's moving in the house?  A cat needs stimulation.......toys, a playmate, playtime with people, etc.....to stay happy inside.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.......|`|WfHfIOSAaa	This is just my idea... Cats are profound creatures. They love to sit and think, but they love to sit and NOT think even more. lol. My cat does that and watches every move in the neighborhood most of the time. Then, other times, she sits and her eyes are completely still and she stares up at the sky... either she's having a really good day dream or she's not thinking about anything at all. It's nice for them to do every now and then... Be free of all the stress of eating and sleeping eating and sleeping and sleeping and sleeping and pooping and sleeping. Ha ha!|`|AA11716381	I've always thought they do it for 2 reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Because they're so much going on out there (birds flying above, squirrels running around).<br>  <br>  And 2. It's like their TV I think. We sit in front of a TV for hours, they sit in front of the window. :)|`|zW5OWgXtaa	Becuase there is movment outside, it entertains them.|`|PKRZtwyHaa	lol my neighbors cat has its own spot by the window, don't know why try talking it out for a walk when its hotter outside|`|sdbc6OlYaa	MINE DOES THE SAME THING!!!<br>  <br>  I think, that it is their entertainment.

JxaE5r1Zaa	as long as they dont have a breeding box(a small box like a nest) they shouldnt breed.  i had a male and a female together for 2 years and they never mated and she never laid eggs.|`|blIUbMzaaa	Most parakeets will not breed with only two of them in the cage.  They require at least two pairs before they will breed.  If they are still very young it is impossible to tell the sex from the color of their cere as it can change color many times before they are finally mature and the cere remains either blue or pink/brown.  It also depends on the color of the birds.

50WCN0graa	As others have said, you really need to get him to a vet immediately. Has he been drinking water? If he hasn't, he is probably dehydrated by this point and that is extremely dangerous. <br>  <br>  A couple quick tests for dehydration..... 1) feel his gums with your fingers. If they are kind of sticky/tacky, then he is dehydrated. A dogs gums should be wet and slippery (same goes for humans). 2) pull up gently on his skin between his front should blades. If it lowers back to normal quickly, that is a good sign. If it lowers back to normal slowly, that is another sign of dehydration. If he is not drinking, do your best to get some water in him NOW! Try seeing if he will drink a tiny bit. If not, maybe wet a wash cloth with water or chicken broth and see if he will suck on that. Truly, if he is refusing liquid, he needs immediate help. Honestly, if he hasn't been drinking water these last 3 days, I wouldn't even wait until morning to go to the vet... I would take him to an emergency vet now. If he is taking liquids, you may be able to wait until morning.<br>  <br>  There are several possibilities regarding what could be wrong.... a virus, a bowel obstruction, infection, bad reaction to something in the vaccine. Some of these things are fatal if not treated quickly. Is he vomiting a lot? Is it projectile vomiting? Does he have diarrhea?<br>  <br>  How long ago did you take him for his vaccines? It is not uncommon that they are a little sick after vaccines (sleepy, don't want to eat). He shouldn't be this sick from it, though.|`|ydshiNrKaa	If this has been going on for 3 days, you should have already taken him to the vet.  Not eating and being lethargic are all indications that something is seriously wrong with your dog.  Even though you just had him to the vet you need to take him back as soon as possible.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	You need to take him back to the Vet.  This isn't normal and you shouldn't wait around any longer.|`|GaL66jbQaa	Don't wait around he needs the vet|`|CEgq26oHaa	It sounds like it could be parvo to me; <br>  <br>  What are the symptoms of parvovirus infection? <br>  <br>  There is a broad range in the severity of symptoms shown by dogs that are infected with parvovirus. Many adult dogs exposed to the virus show very few, if any, symptoms. The majority of cases of disease are seen in dogs less than 6 months of age with the most severe cases seen in puppies younger than 12 weeks of age. There are also significant differences in response to parvovirus infections and vaccines among different breeds of dogs, with Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and Labrador Retrievers being more susceptible than other breeds. <br>  <br>  The most common form of the disease is the intestinal form known as enteritis. Parvovirus enteritis is characterized by vomiting (often severe), diarrhea, dehydration, dark or bloody feces, and in severe cases, fever and lowered white blood cell counts. Acute parvovirus enteritis can be seen in dogs of any breed, sex, or age. The disease will progress very rapidly and death can occur as early as two days after the onset of the disease. The presence of gram negative bacteria, parasites, or other viruses can worsen the severity of the disease and slow recovery. <br>  <br>  A less common form of the disease causes myocarditis (inflammation of the heart).|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	They have medications at petco or petsmart that are for vomiting, if your dog doesn't get better, then a trip to the vet would probably be best she/he may have ingested something they weren't supposed to, I remember my dog got sick and when we went to the vet we found out she ate the stuffing inside of a stuffed animal, hope this helps!|`|XNxFBrbAaa	did he get his parvo?.....you should take him to the vets<br>  <br>  my shepherd mix that i adopted contracted parvo..i had em fer like 2 days and i noticed him bein funny(similar simptoms)....so i took him in right away and he was just on the onset of it....after 4 days in a row of vet trips....we  managed to save him...but parvo is a swift killer i would make sure he doesnt have it|`|T6SPad3Haa	Look carefully.. is their blood in his stool? If so he may have parvovirus. <br>  <br>  You should take him to the vet for more than just the vaccines and get some tests done because if he has something with those symptoms it could be fatal.|`|2WeT5ocWaa	I don't know how to type you this, but I think your dog is dieing....maybe you should take it to the vet.

He's definitely calico in color.<br>  <br>  Judging by the large head he may have some Persian or Himalayan in him. Also note he's cross-eyed and has the "dropped face/lips", which makes me want to lean toward a Himalayan mix. But still, very hard to tell. Try guessing again in 4-8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Very cute though! :)|`|4aAhEK9daa	That's Memebon <a href="http://www.memebon.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.memebon.jp/</a>  Those pics were from when she was only a couple weeks old.  The father cat was a Scottish Fold - the mother an Exotic Shorthair (their pics are on that site).  Not sure why they cross bred, but then again, that's Japan where cuteness overpowers ethical breeding.  She looks like an Exotic Shorthair though she wouldn't be able to have papers as such since she's mixed.<br>  <br>  The Exotic Shorthair's the shorthaired version of the Persian - a breed created in the 60's by crossing the Persian with the American Shorthair.  They have the cobby body shape, thick limbs and flat face of the Persian but with a short very plush coat.  They feel like stuffed teddy bears!<br>  <br>  I have one - Penelope - that I adopted when she was four years old.  SO sweet. Always has to be where I'm at.  Bonded with me the very day I brought her home!  If you're interested in an Exotic - check shelters first.  They get surrendered to shelters just like other cats.  And you'd be saving a life by adopting one.  <br>  <br>  The Exotic is a pretty expensive pedigreed cat.  Pet quality kittens will cost you at least $600-$700 for pet quality and show quality into the thousands.  If you want to buy one from a breeder do be sure they're a REPUTABLE breeder selling TICA or CFA registered animals and that they test for PKD.  PKD - Polycystic Kidney Disease - is a early onset form of kidney disease that Persians, Exotics and Himalayans are predisposed to.  There's now a simple cheek swab DNA test that can be done.  Reputable breeders test their cats and NEVER breed PKD+ animals.  Backyard breeders DON'T so they end up with entire litters of PKD+ animals.  A cat with PKD can go into renal failure and die as early as young as four years old.<br>  <br>  edit: there's no such thing as an "Irish" Fold the breed is SCOTTISH Fold.  Ragdolls have POINTED markings and they don't have a flat face.  Calico is a colouration - not a breed.  Persian kittens have MUCH longer fur than this kitten - an Exotic Shorthair.|`|ZZJKTV8laa	def a persian|`|ijLD9rZpaa	Awww! It's so cute! Calico cat. Very pretty!

6KxBqnstaa	I would call a wildlife rehabber in your area and tell of this as they can come take a look and try to catch it and get it care.It will need antibiotics as infection will set in and eventually kill it. If you see it again call a local vet and get number to rehabber and tell them what and where you saw it or see if someone can catch it with a net and get to a rehabber.  The bird could be in agony and will try not to show it because that will make it more vunerable to predators.|`|AA11887983	It may not have been torture.

YtBzRAxMaa	Sorry folks - look again - what I see is a horse that is over jumping by at least a foot. <br>   I'll bet he rushes them too - and is hard to bring back after the jump. <br>   Lay out some trotting poles before and after the jump and school this horse over a cross rail at the trot - he needs to chill so you can concentrate on jumping form rather than " OMG" as he flies around.<br>    A "slower" steadier pace and mount will give you the chance to work on your form.<br>    I totally agree with the toes - they need to point in the direction you are going. Your release is fine - you will not jerk his mouth. Your upper body shows control and is fine.<br>   To fix your legs - <br>  at the walk stand straight up using your fingers under the pommel to balance. I mean straight with no bends.<br>   Put all your weight in your heel with your toes facing forward - make sure your feet are NOT touching the sides of the stirrup (this is common with "duck toes")<br>   Use your knees to grip.<br>   Once you can stay up for a full minute -<br>   Slowly bend from the knee ONLY and sit down - do not move from the knee down or the hip up (don't lean forward or back)<br>  <br>   Straight line from the hip to the ankle - always.<br>  <br>   Now walk and trot in two point - keeping your feet in the right spot (if they slip, simply stand up and place them again) with all your weight in your heels. This will build your core strength and teach you to balance independantly (upper and lower)<br>   FYI this is one of the hardest things to master as you progress and is not an uncommon fault.<br>   You are doing GREAT!!!<br>  <br>  Your instructor might want to put a ground line on both sides...<br>  and maybe have you TROT over a jump that is barely a foot high...|`|lECtqGHSaa	the 2nd one is better but ur release over the jump is 2 big. its not a very big jump  and ur giving a release that's for a jump about 4 feet tall. my leg always slips back when i ride keep riding with out ur stirrups and jump without stirrups 2 that's wat i did and it made my leg really strong|`|OjeL1if4aa	I saw the problem before the picture even fully loaded... you are WAY OVER JUMPING. Your hips should be centered over the saddle and you should only be a couple of inches out of the seat... if that!<br>  <br>  You don't need to release near as much over small fences... just a small amount of give and release is all your horse needs.<br>  <br>  Also point your toes more forward and not out. <br>  <br>  Your leg isn't bad at all, once you quit over jumping and stay centered over the saddle your leg will be where it needs to.<br>  <br>  Something to help with the over jumping... touch your seat bones to the saddle just before you jump. Also lean farther back as you aproach the jump... you should be sitting up almost straight when you take off. You'll still go into your two-point, but you won't be so far ahead.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	first off, you need to work on pointing your toes forward, not out to the sides. what you are doing in these photos is using the back of your calf muscle. this is why your toes are out and your legs slide back. you need to go back to flat work for this because if it's happening over the jumps, then its happening on the flat too. i would try riding bareback as this REALLY teaches you how to use the right muscles. ideally, you want to hold your horse from your inner calf, not the back. to do this, wrap your legs around your horse's sides. make sure your toes are facing forward and really try and feel your horse's belly. it should feel like your giving your horse a BIG hug with your legs. <br>  <br>  =]]<br>  hope this helps & good luck!|`|ddVhUnuSaa	I see your problem, you are sitting too far forward. I used to have the same problem. I thought you leaned forward when jumping. WRONG. Jumping is just standing in your stirups a little bit and tucking your body in. Try lifting your chest more and sit back in the saddle more.<br>  <br>  You are also "hugging" the horse. Your arms seem to be resting on the horse's neck and your chest is too close to it's neck. Try lifting your upper body more up and sitting back.<br>  <br>  I also suggest riding bareback to help with balance and leg control.|`|OXA9s57Uaa	I used to have that same problem. Over smaller jumps like that, my trainer made me lean forward into your two point and keep my hands in the same position as when youre riding, and don't move them or reach. When youre jumping higher jumps you need to reach that far up the neck to really get off his back but here, just practice that. since youre not leaning so far up the neck, your feet should get a good feel of where they need to be.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	all what blake h said u should be in too-point which u r bring ur shoulders back just a tiny bit and dont lean all the way forward on his neck|`|780c50eb467560c6248a0ca6f53da60caa	i would suggest less reach with your upper body for now. Untill you get you lower half situated and sturdy, less reach. Looks like you hips are throwing you lower leg out to slip. The jumps are small, so work on waiting and having you horse come to you for your two point to ride the jump. Only work on getting you lower leg steady with a slight rock of the hips for the two point. Ride the jump and sit the landing. Work on you inner thigh becoming stonger (it will feel like its streaching) also work on your outer hip becoming stronger (Hip aductors and abductors) Thoes muscles will help keep your seat, which will be easier on you lower leg.... It really looks like you have a good calf and ankle and keep working on it. <br>  <br>  PS its good to be critical on yourself!! That way you are better, stronger, faster!!|`|u65h6DN6aa	From the photos, I can see that you are leaning far too forward for the size of the jump. Practise just standing up straight in the stirrups, if you fall forwards, backwards etc grab hold of the mane to steady yourself. Do it at the walk, trot, canter to get balanced. To get the upper body tipped more forward, when jumping assume the upright standing position, then give with your arms by offering them to your horse, not sliding them up towards his ears and resting them on him neck. By resting them on his neck, you are putting weight on his neck which causes your whole body to tip much more frward than you need to be. If you keep yourself light and balanced (without using the horse to balance on) you will be better prepared if he happened to leap over a jump or refuse|`|RloOJ43haa	It looks to me like you are jumping ahead. Your buttocks are WAY out of the saddle in both pictures. You are also pinching with your knee which makes it a fulcrum. When you throw your shoulders forward and your knee is the pivot point, your lower leg will naturally slip back. <br>  <br>  You need to wait for the horse to jump up to you. Remember that your horse can handle it a lot better if you are way behind rather than a little bit ahead. I bet that if you can stop jumping ahead, that your horse will get to be a better ride. <br>  <br>  I'm a bit concerned that your trainer has not been able to help you with this. Sometimes you can make progress on a problem by taking a clinic with a different trainer for a day or two. Sometimes when someone explains things in a different way or had new exercises, suddenly things make sense. I suggest you try to find one in your area.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Well i used to have a problem similar to this. My trainer said that i was "genetically programed" to ride the way that i ride and it wasn't going to change. (I had a lot of trouble sitting in a full seat). Make sure that your leaning back in a full seat till about 1 stride to the jump than don't rest your body on his neck whenever he jumps up into your hands, release but don't over reach. Just put your shoulders back, sink in your thighs, heels down, thumbs up, looking forward. Practice will only help on this, i did eventually get my full seat down. You'll be able to get your perfect 2 point someday. Just keep working with your trainer on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
Rx7wv4JLaa	Fleas are an environmental issue and there is no quick fix.<br>  <br>  Medications from the vet is the best and most effective why to get rid of fleas. The medication does one of two things..it either kills the fleas every time they bite your dog for food or it makes it so their eggs can not hatch. The medication is good and stay's in their system for about a month. It is important to continue treatment for at least 4 months.<br>  <br>  Fleas need the blood from your dog for food and for reproduction. B/c of this it is important to treat all animals in your house including cats and rabbits.<br>  <br>  Fleas baths and powders and home based ones like dish soap..these products only kill the fleas on your animal at that moment and do not kill any in the environment or that will feed off your pet a few hours to days later.<br>  <br>  Flea collars are known to be toxic.<br>  <br>  Flea spray's and bombing..these products can get rid of fleas but don't always and aren't always effective for kills their eggs which are deep into flooring.

iJtuhLMTaa	Yes it is possible especially of two larger minis are bred together.  Toy, Mini and Standard Poodles are all the same breed  just different  variates.  The varieties can be interbred and the offspring would be resisted poodles.  Their variety is determined by their size not what their parents were so if the offspring of 2 minis was over 15 inches  when full grown it would be classified as a standard Poodle.<br>  <br>  The same is try for any breeding of poodles, 2 standards or 2 toys could produce a mini or 2 minis could produce a toy.   It would obviously be unlikely for 2 toys to produce a standard or 2 standards to produce a toy but technically it could happen.<br>  <br>  Edit: Siberian I have to disagree about the Rough Collie Sheltie comparison.  They are 2 distinct breeds and cannot be interbred to produce a purebred dog.  Poodles are 3 variates of the same breed they have the exact same breed standard except for size and can be freely interbred to produce purebred poodles.  There is only one breed Poodle with 3 varieties toy, mini and standard, similar to how Dachshunds are all the same breed but divided by size and coat type or American Cockers are divided by color<br>  <br>  Edit: On a side note the KC and many other kennel clubs consider the different Poodle sizes  distinct breeds and not different variaties of the same breed.  In those countries they can't be interbred or an "off sized" dog registerd as another size it would just be out of standard for it's  breed.   Its similar to how  Schanuzers are with the AKC.  You can't breed a mini Schnzer to a standard Schnazer and has a purebred because they are different breeds and for that same reason you couldn't register a oversized Mini Schnauzer as a Standard it would just be and oversized mini. <br>  <br>     However  in the US where you are showing to be from the Poodle is registered as one breed with 3 variates  (with the AKC)  therefore they can interbreed and variety (toy, mini and standard) are determined by the size of the dog only not by paternity. <br>  <br>  How similar breeds are split varies from Kennel Club to Kennel club.   For example with the KC the Belgian Shepherd Dogs are all one breed with different variaties divided by coat type.  Where as in the US they are all distictive breeds|`|L22hVXTIaa	The answer to your question is "no."  But just like there is usually a runt in every litter, there is usually one pup that is the largest. Sometimes, the large pups are just the most dominant pup and get most of the milk while pushing others away. However, from my experience breeding dogs, the largest in the litter doesn't automatically mature to be the biggest dog.  It just depends.  Your big pup may grow to be larger than his litter mates, but that just makes him a large miniature poodle - not a standard.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	No, he's just a bigger miniature.|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	no|`|csDhZDvraa	Yes and no.

To say they are the same is like saying an over grown Sheltie is the same breed as a Rough Collie.

If you were a responsible breeder you would know this.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	If your mini female had been gotten to by a male standard the litter usually results  rather irregular sizes so some would resemble a mini and some more larger like a Standard.There is an easy way to find out just DNA the pup you suspect to the parents and you will find out what has happened,that is if you wish to go for the expense.When you have a litter of puppies scientifically speaking you should get 50% of Mum and the same from Dad.Sometimes if you are not careful as to your breeding practice you will get an uneven litter especially if it is a 'wild out cross'or 'in breeding 'especially if the two poodles are too closely related..<br>  In practice you sometimes do get one puppy that is significantly smaller than all the other puppies or much bigger than the others.What you have here is a simple play in genetics pure and simple you cannot get a standard poodle from a mating between two pure bred miniature poodles it does not happen that way.l am not sure whether you are asking this question for a joke or being serious.If you wish to breed just because you have a male and female of the same breed does not make you a Breeder.An awful lot of research should be made before mating dogs so you eliminate any hereditary diseases and produce healthy ,hereditary clear puppies and as you must know mini poodles do have some eye problems which the parents should be tested for before breeding|`|AA11887983	No, just a bigger poodle.

AA11625368	Staph infections are typically bacterial in nature. Antibiotics should work in killing off the organism. This staph may be developing resistancy to cephalexin. Maybe your vet should try a stronger antibiotic, such as Clavamox, Baytil, or Zeniquin. Might help in killing off the source. As for your dog living with this condition for the rest of his life, no one can predict the future not even your vet.

Most bacterial skin infections in dogs are secondary to another disease    Treatment for Staph Infection  Bacterial infections such as staph are often secondary to another problem. The possibility of parasitic infections, allergies, and hormonal abnormalities should be checked with your veterinarian. The skin is usually biopsied and/or cultured to confirm the diagnosis. Oral antibiotics are selected based on the test results, and may need to be given for several months if the infection is very deep.

I hope the does not... but if he does it may be manageable. We owned a beautiful Gordon Setter. He repeatedly had staph and yeast infections. after several years of various diagnosis and treatments our vet sent in a test and discovered the dog had an auto-immune problem. The vet said these pop-up occassionally. Some times they are random and sometimes they are hereditary. (FYI--- I checked back with our breeder and other owners of dogs from the same kennel and none of theirs had the problem ) We resolved the problems for quite awhile with prednisone unitl the doseage had to be increased to the point where the dog was miserable from the side effects.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	I hate to say it, but if your vet recommends him being on antibiotics to fight the staph infection, I think I'd do it.  Staph is a serious infection that can quickly invade the blood stream and infect the rest of the body causing him to go toxic.  It's a really horrible and out of the blue death.  I think I'd stick to the antibiotics, especially if they don't seem to be causing your dog any harm.  And maybe consult a different vet to find out what other options can be taken.

ickyq53aaa	Here is a breakdown of the basic minimum costs assuming you are keeping your horse or pony on your own property. These costs do not reflect the value of the property, land taxes, insurance, or property maintenance including barns and fences. The price of feed and professional services varies from one region to another so these costs will need to be adjusted for your area.     One half bale of hay $1.50 per day   Six month supply of loose mineral supplement $25.00 or 0.07 per day   Salt block $14.00 or $0.04 per day   Two two cup servings of inexpensive concentrate per day $1.00   Farrier every six week at $25 per trim or $0.60 day   De-wormer every 3 months $0.20 per day   Dentistry once a year at $75 or $0.20 per day   Annual basic vaccinations of vabies, tetanus, equine influenza, and rhinomune vaccines at $95.00 or $0.27 per day   Minimum cost per day to keep one horse $3.88 per day or 1416.20 per year.     The costs quickly increase with:     feeding more expensive concentrates or supplements   immunizing for other diseases such as West Nile Virus   a horse that requires shoes.   competing with your horse,   a horse that is ill or injured.   breeding your horse to produce a foal.   your normally good pasture is hit with drought or the price of feed is driven up by bad weather or other circumstances.    Horse and Pony Keeping By the Day, Week, Month and Year   Every Day  Provide fresh clean water.   Provide adequate fodder and concentrates.   Provide adequate shelter and blanketing according to the weather.   Do a visual check for scrapes, cuts, bruises and puncture wounds.   Do a visual check for signs of illness such as runny eyes or noses, or sounds of coughing or wheezing.   Clean hooves and check for bruising or cracks, or loose shoes.   Muck out the stall if your horse is stabled.   Every Week  Check the amount of concentrate, fodder and bedding on hand.   If horses are kept in a small acreage, clean manure from paddocks (could also be done daily).   Check fences for broken rails, loose wire, protruding nails etc.that could cause injury.   Scrub out water trough and feed buckets.  Every Month  If you board your horse at a stable make sure your board bill is paid on time.   Every Six to Eight Weeks   Have your farrier in to trim hooves or re-set horseshoes.   Every Two to Three Months  Administer de-worming medication.   Once a Year  Have teeth checked and floated by an equine dentist or veterinarian.   Have immunizations administered by veterinarian.|`|j5k0VRbPaa	tell her that when she gets older she not gonna want it anymore|`|ReHd1IlYaa	"No. get one when you are on your own"|`|xpP1PsAoaa	YOUR AN IDIOT|`|2vH6VktWaa	They do smelley poops|`|gXt0wdLuaa	you know hoow much the food costs for them? also somebody will have to get up early every morning to feed it, and muck it out everyday, and ater a while she will get boredd of it. try and distract her with something easier like a rabbit...  or get a cat:)|`|vow5ULxTaa	" i do not  think you are responible to enough to take car of a large animal yet."    i would suggest lessons and then leasing so that she can show she is responsible before considering buying.    and tell her the unquoted things in your own words.    i am 18 and goign to college with an equine major and my horse horse was mine i groomed it fed it rode it etc without help of my parents.    id suggest leasing a horse if she really wants one until she is 15 or 16 becasue i was a rare case and chose horses over boys when i turned 15.  most turn to boys and if they own a horse sell it.|`|9vPeyK6taa	sure|`|CAAcoqtYaa	How about you shut up and get on with life. :P    Or no you cannot have a pony.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	First of all owning a horse or pony is VERY expensive, you have to pay for food, the lodging, the horse has to be groomed and the hooves cleaned and taken care of, this can range up to 500.00 a week...get her a dog or cat instead.|`|AA11625368	Horses are very expensive to keep, require daily attention (2 to 3 times daily), and is a very important commitment.

Ponies are small horses and they still eat like horses and poop like horses.    Little girls often outgrow their ponies and horses.  What will your family do with the creature when she outgrows it?    Many years ago there was a forgotten pony who lived in a pasture near our house.  The little girl grew up and lost interest in the pony.  Her hooves were rarely trimmed and grew to the point where the poor creature must have been very uncomfortable.  The pony had lots of food and water, but was very lonely.  My sister visited Patches and took her carrots and apples and would groom her from time to time.  But the pony was neglected by her family.    Your family becomes the horse's herd.  Horses are very social creatures and thrive on companionship.  If you can't visit the creature regularly and give it lots of love and attention for twenty years or longer if you buy it as a foal, then there's the potential for another lonely neglected pony ten years down the line.    There are way too many neglected and forgotten horses out there.  Do you want to contribute to the tragedy?    Maybe your daughter can become a volunteer groomer at a nearby boarding stable.  Lots of horse crazy girls will do this.  My husband's niece did this when she was in middle school.  She's twenty now, and has outgrown her "horsey phase" and has other interests.|`|FIDAzKSPaa	Why would you say no? As long as you have the space for a pony and your daughter does the work it's a good thing. It will keep her busy and teach her to be responsible. As long as she does the work....    My sister got a pony called Jessie when she was 10. For the first few weeks she spent so much time with Jessie, it was summer time and she loved it. Then she got a little tired of all the work (cleaning out the stables, feeding, grooming etc) and my father started to do it more and more. When the winter came he was out there in the dark after work looking after the horse while my sister watched TV or did her homework. My sister still rode the pony but she left most of the work to dad. Eventually she grew too big for Jessie and we had to give her away. (Jessie, not my sister)    Basically, having a pony requires a lot more work than most animals, e.g. a dog. Maybe she could spend a few days helping out at a horse riding school to find out what it's really like to look after a pony. If she gets on good you could offer her a deal: As long as she looks after the pony and doesn't leave all the work to someone else she could get it. If she doesn't do the work let her know that the pony will be sold. If she knows the consequences and agrees then you are not being unfair.     Good luck|`|FFtlPjlbaa	I heard that pony's are mean...  why don't you try offering her another cute animal like a puppy or a kitten|`|F80jKUvYaa	Just tell her no. Tell her that right now a pony is alot to take care of as well as lessons to be able to learn to ride the horse and everything.

A pony, although it may be inexpensive to buy, the vet care and upkeep is costly, and you may want to research all of that before you agree. Find out if there are stable near your home and see if she can work with equines before she has a responsibility like owning one. alot of stables will gladly take in youngsters to teach them proper care for ponies and horses. It is important to take note that if the pony becomes ill, it can cost thousands to have it treated.

AA10029366	I'd suspect a petit mal seizure, or possibly an intermittent neurological disorder (possibly in the beginning stages?).

Usually by jumping up or down from a chair.  This will cause partial paralysis and the head bobbling and mild shaking would be a common reaction to the pain.  If he's been acting fine, it is possible that it was a temporary slip and somehow slipped back into place.  I'm not sure if your pup is allowed on the furniture or not, but maybe you can recall if he did any jumping last night.  It's probably hard to tell since you were in the kitchen, but the vet may ask you similar questions.  At any rate, best of luck with your baby!    Kim at: http://www.peaceful-organic-planet.com/n...|`|3urpilpBaa	That stinks :(  Could be a variety of things.  Keep a close eye on him and if it starts to happen again try to get it on video if possible.  Or write down exactly what is happening moment to moment.  It is difficult to recall back and vets need as much info as possible as dogs cannot tell them what is wrong.    If it happens again look at his eyes and note if they are rolled back or jumping from side to side.     Back legs could be nerve damage (back injury is very prominant in dachs) but bobbing head, spinning, etc can be neurological. Did he jump off the couch and land wrong?  Is he painful at all if you pick him up or feel his back and legs?  These are questions your vet may ask you.    Could be a toxin of some form, make sure all house plants are out of reach, and that there is no mouse/rat poison anywhere.  No pills (like a Tylenol) or drugs dropped or gotten into (Don't be offended-marijuana poisoning can look like this)? No leftover people food?     Good luck, I hope everything turns out ok!
fypgDK53aa	Not to negate helpful answers, but you'll find most people on here who are against spaying are breeders. This means that their rabbits are BRED and therefore allowed to act in more natural behaviours surrounding their hormonal does. In most cases, unspayed does don't really make ideal pets, and there's a few health reasons that are indisputable.     Aside from reduction of reproductive cancers, the behavioural benefits of spaying are huge.     Female rabbits may show hormonal behaviours like nesting, pulling out their fur, antisocial behaviour, territorial behaviour, biting, and spraying of urine to mark territory. Unspayed female rabbits can downight seem "moody" for thier desire to have a litter of kits.     The cost will differ vet to vet, but assume ~$200(CDN) or more. Some clinics will do this for more or less, but be sure that you have a rabbit savvy vet!

It will help prevent cancer in the future (which is very likely with unspayed female rabbits).. trust me you don't want that.    "Spay/neuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country. The low end of the range can be as inexpensive as $50-75 (often in spay/neuter clinics), while vets in major metropolitan areas, where rents and labor costs are very high, often charge several hundred dollars."    -http://www.rabbit.org/health/spay.html    Check out that site for more information

Try looking here to see if there is a Westie Rescue in your area:    http://www.westieusa.com/    P.S.  I have a Westie-Poodle mix and absolutely adore the Westie antics.

They have links to the various national and state breed clubs and rescue organizations. They work together to police their own ranks and help keep you contact reliable breeders and rescue people. Be prepared to travel or be patient. Local animals from reliable sources are not always available. I would never, ever consider any other "puppy search engines" found on the internet. In my experience most of them are backyard breeders at best and puppy mills at worst. I always visit a breeder in person or by proxy and talk to multiple references.|`|4b8fb7d13eab5f34e3a4f0ce4fbb2680aa	So sorry for your loss - go through one of the breed rescue schemes mentioned, somewhere there's a little Westie waiting for you.

I can tell you are grieving your girl.  I lost my beloved Scottie several months ago. I've been in your position. When we decided to bring another Scottie to our home, we viewed it as our love for our little girl allowed our hearts to grow and be able to love another. It wasn't a "replacement" since our girl would always live in our hearts.    I hunted petfinder and Scottie rescue, but could not find a dog available. You may be finding this with Westie Rescue. Not every state has a rescue and many won't consider adoptions out of state. It is good to check with the rescues though and look daily. Some people with Scotties also have Westies, so widen your search to include Scottie rescues as well. They occasionally get a Westie. I found a couple of wheaten colored Scotties incorrectly called Westies on petfinder--but they were cross country for me with no out-of-state adoptions.    Also, consider contacting reputable Westie breeders. The dog we got was from our male dog's breeder. I really didn't want a puppy. The breeder had a young adult female she had kept for breeding purposes, but as she grew, the dog wasn't exactly to standard and the breeder chose not to breed her. Good breeders will take dogs back, so it is possible for a breeder to have a dog that the owners could not care for. These are still good dogs.    Good luck. The right Westie will find you. It may just take weeks or months, but the right one will find you.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Did you try Petfinder.com or google Westie Rescue?  There has got to be a Westie out there needing rescue.  And try not to focus on the breed.  There are some mixes who would give you back love also.    When you rescue one dog your rescue two.  The one you take home and the one that comes from a shelter to a foster home to take it's place.|`|PgQ8dR7baa	I am so sorry to hear of your loss.  Its awful when you lose a pet in any circumstances.  You would not be unkind to her memory, in fact she would love you to give your home to another pet just like her.

No one can ever take away your memories, and she will love you forever.    I hope you find another pet soon, and your heartache eases soon.

IuYekkPVaa	They love the smell.  The root of the plant contains a terpenoid chemical - valerinone. Valerinone is a chemical very similar to catnip's nepetalactone (the active ingredient in catnip that cats respond to).     Many cats that don't respond to catnip go wild for valerian or honeysuckle.
e9gXZsKxaa	Never put 2 bettas together, even if it's a male and female. The only time they are put together is to spawn. Most male bettas will try to kill the female after they spawn so you still have to remove them. When you get a chance, get a 2.5 gallon with a heater and sponge filter. Bowls are inappropriate homes for a betta (it would be like living in a closet your whole life, which will suck). It's a myth that they like to be in tiny bowls, they are from the rice patties and swamps that are miles long (there natural habitat is huge, so the small space thing is irrelevant). Bettas come in all colors, orange is rare though. Females are not as colorful but have more energy in my experience and just as cool as the males. Hikari Betta-Bio Gold is a great and reputable brand, 4 pellets a day is about right, look at your bettas eye, that's how big his stomach is, so feed accordingly. Variety is important for bettas to thrive, once or twice a week, give them brine shrimp or bloodworms (my bettas love them). Feed them blanched peas a couple times a month to prevent SBS (swim bladder syndrome). Fast one day out of the week, this is good for their digestive tract. Bettas in time will recognize their owners and even their voices. Bettas are pretty smart, I've taught mine to follow my fingers, jump for food, swim through a hoop and push a marble around with her nose.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	Do not put even a male and female together unless it is to breed (once this is accomplished one or both should be removed).

If you get a little 5 or 10 gallon tank you could get some small tank mates for him, but not another Betta.|`|MWWKMsFIaa	Congraz on your new friend!<br>  And...<br>  If you get another Betta and get a girl don't put them together!<br>  It is VERY hard to breed them and they could kill each other.<br>  So if you get another betta boy or girl don't put them together.<br>  <br>  Thank you for reading|`|3BfNshHYaa	k first of all having the two bettas in the same bowl is a bad idea i think.  They fight and will probably kill each other lol<br>  <br>  I have a male beta (blue), and he eats very quickly, once i put the food in.  and usually he only eats 2-3 flakes tho.  also, u have to know that betas are eeeeeextremely lazy, they do nothing. all day.  they sit. they seem like they're dead! but its not so dont panick lol. once i left my beta for a week with no food cuz i went on vacation.  but it was fine still when i came back... so i think they can survive w/out food for a long time<br>  <br>  hope it hlps... btw u can ask me more questions about betas as i have one... <br>  <br>  oh yeah, and betas live in puddles... according to the internet... so a dirty cage for a while isnt that bad, bu i recommend still keeping it clean|`|YnCUyvK7aa	1)  and he is in this little bowl(i heard that they like small spaces) <br>  <br>  - Bettas don't like small places, stores just keep them in small bowls because they have to be kept separately to keep them from fighting.  A betta is a tropical fish, and needs to be in a heated [and preferably filtered] aquarium of at least 2.5 or 5 gallons.<br>  <br>  <br>  2)i'm going to petco tomorrow and i might get another betta.<br>  i might get another male(i know i have to keep them separate)<br>  but if i got a female i might put them in the same bowl. if i put them in the same bowl do you think they would necessarily breed? <br>  <br>  - Very bad idea!! The only time you keep a male and female togheter [at least without a divider] is when you're trying to breed them.  You have to condition the fish for a few weeks beforehand, and once the eggs have been laid, you have to remove the female.  If you don't she could eat the eggs, or the male could kill her defending his nest.  And expect torn and shredded fins just from the mating and courtship process.  If either fish isn't ready to mate and you put them together in a small space, 1 is going to be killed by the other [and it's not always the male that kills the female, I've had it happen where a female killed a male].<br>  <br>  <br>  3) do you know what color bettas are most common? <br>  <br>  - reds, blues, white/cream/pale yellow and mixtures of these<br>  <br>  4) least common?<br>  <br>  - a pure green<br>  <br>  <br>  5) easiest to find at petco or petsmart?<br>  <br>  - The Petco near me carries a better selection of tail types and colors but the either should have a good selection. <br>  <br>  6)  i also have a question about the food.  i have Betta Bio-Gold fish food.  i gave my betta 4 pellets.  i was wondering if they eat slowly or if you think he's just not hungry? (lol) but also he seems very shy.<br>  <br>  - This is probably related to his water temperature an being in a bowl.  Being a tropical fish, if the water temperature isn't at least 76 degrees F, he'll be lethargic and not eat as well.  Plus, it may take the pellets a while to soften enough for him to eat.  And some bettas are picky eaters, especially when they're new.  And in a bowl, the water quality can go bad faster and build up ammonia, and this keeps your fish from having a good appetite.<br>  <br>  7)  but like they said they would like recognize the owner and caretaker. so i was wondering if your betta does this, and if it does how long did it take for that to happen?<br>  <br>  - Yes, they will recognize at least the person who feeds them.  I never really kept track of how long it took mine to recognize me, but I would say it's 1-2 weeks depending if you're the only 1 doing the feeding.|`|NCWo1n9faa	if u get a girl u mite not want 2 couse the females r Very mean and they well bite the males tale but that is just her way of saying that she likes him|`|bDPVRtCNaa	1. Space requirements: It's a common misconception that, because they can live in small spaces, that they like them. Betta's can survive small spaces, but will thrive in appropriately sized aquariums. 2.5 gallons+<br>  2. Keeping a male with a female is not wise. This is especially true in a bowl where the female will have nowhere to escape to.<br>  3. Not before they killed one another. Even if the pair spawned, the female would eat the eggs.<br>  4. Most common: Red<br>  5. Least common: Black<br>  6. Petsmart sells veil tails and crowntails. Petco sells veil tails, crowntails, halfmoons, and deltas.<br>  7. Betta's will occasionally refuse food if their water is too cold.<br>  8. My fish swim up and down the sides of their aquariums when I walk by in hopes that I will feed them.<br>  <br>  ~A bowl has little surface area which means little oxygen is present in the water. There is no filter, so the fish waste will build up. They are too small to be fitted with a filter or a heater which makes them completely unsuited to house fish. Betta's can survive like this, but I'd rather have fish in my care thriving.<br>  <br>  ~The rice paddies of Thailand are not puddles. Bettas are built to survive the dry season, but should not be subjected to filthy conditions are a regular basis. It will shorten their lifespan. Also, the bettas sold in pet stores have never even seen a mud puddle. In fact, the water for a fry tank must be in perfect condition.

e9gXZsKxaa	Lower the water surface to about 2 inches, I never had a betta jump that high. They are jumpers but their long flowing fins prevent them from jumping high.|`|DJOEV2TDaa	I would say that people only say that because of some of the different "tanks" (I wouldnt even call them tanks) that people keep Beta fish in.<br>  <br>  Its horrible, just because the fish can breathe from the top of the water people keep them in all kinds of tiny, horrible little things with no tops on them.<br>  <br>  If you have a proper place for your fish to live... ie: a real little fish tank with a top and stuff, he'll be fine.|`|51St5GEcaa	they can only jump from the surface, so if the surface is low, they can't jump out. I recommend about 1 1/2 to 2 inches from the surface, but that's only if you have enough depth to spare. <br>  <br>  bettas are crazy.

The holes in the mesh still allow air flow and if the fish jumps he'll hit the mesh and fall back into the water. You can cut the mesh to size so that it's not so obvious to the eye. Besides preventing fish suicides (lots of fishes are jumpers besides bettas), it helps to cool the tank a bit during hot weather. Instead of a single big piece of mesh, which could be troublesome during feeding time, alternative is to use smaller panels attached together with plastic loop fasteners. Then you can open & close a single panel during feeding time just like a flap. Hope the above idea enables you to sleep in peace now!|`|A6MUoeJRaa	at the pet store they sell beta tanks designed to keep them from jumping. we had betas (now we have 1) most of them jumped and we found them. they jump because of something in their water they don't like or another beta is nearby and they can see it.|`|qoceyXTqaa	I would recommend a couple of floating plants as well, as they can give the beta something to hinder it at the top and therefore less likely to jump out.|`|NCWo1n9faa	get a new lid|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I've never had my bettas jump out.

rJF35zPKaa	It depends on the the size of the tank and fish types you have. But, you didnt mention our tank size. So, from the fish details you have given, the tank size should be atleast 20 Gallons(i assume) and if so, change 20%-25% water once in 3 to 4 days. Because your fish stocking is exactly fit now for a 20G tank. If your tank size is less than 20G you should change water more frequently and also thik about overstocking of fish... because frequent water changing doesnt support you to overstock your tank. And, incse if you have a tank of more than 20G, weekly water change would be fine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you. Take care about your fish and don't let them bothered with the water conditions... All the best..!|`|xUNwC1B8aa	The first reply is correct. You need to take out the carp (goldfish) because they are cooler water fish and the others are tropical fish that require warmer waters in about the 78 degree range.  As for the other reply NEVER change ALL the water in a tank. Get it stable after taking out the goldfish and do a 10-25% water change a week and only do up to 50% at a time in cases where the water quality has gone bad for some reason (fish dieing, uneaten food not cleaned up, power outs for long periods ext)  Your tank builds up a natural biological filtration that is more than just in your filter. It is living in your rocks, water and substrate and taking that out after you have established an aquarium is almost like adding fish to a brand new tank the day it is set up..

Wt61EclRaa	Yes we just adopted our third greyhound and it took him 3 days to learn how to do stairs.  He learned up after the second time.  We held a cookie in front of him.  Down was a lot harder.  He would literally sit down and not budge.  Finally after my husband carried him down like 3-4 times....I left him upstairs by himself and came down to get dinner started.  Next thing I knew I heard him come down.  At first he was very cautious...now he flies up and down all the steps in our house.  Our first two greyhounds(all were around 3-4 years old) knew how to do it after the first try.  I know the place we adopt from has stairs going in and out of the kennels-but there are only about 5 steps.  My friend got a baby boxer and she had to teach him to do stairs.  They are so cute when learning.  I LOVE doggies!|`|AA12205365	Any dog can have a fear of stairs if they haven't had experience with them.  My current dog a 7-8 cattle dog/dalmatian took months before he would walk up stairs.  The 1st time he went down them he crawled on his belly.  For a long leggy dog it's a bit scary.   Puppies are generally fearless enough to just have a go at it.|`|T1RZFeXJaa	i think its something every dog would hav 2 get used 2.<br>  My dog is 9mths now and th other week he had 2 walk down the stairs and it was the cutest thing even he was only going down 1 step at a  time but bringing his back legs on the step at the same time, its probs because the arent used 2 it and its a great height for them, compared to what it would seem like to us.|`|q0vKbocHaa	when people say greyhounds have issues with stairs, it is talking about full grown dogs that were formally racing dogs.

If dogs aren't exposed to stairs, they tend to be a bit afraid of them, especially going down.
AraBfesHaa	If you already have guppies, don't get any more fish.  Chances are extremely high, that if you bought any female guppies, they're already pregnant, and will give birth to up to 80+ fry in each batch, every 4 weeks for 6 months before having to mate again with a male.  You'll run out of room in no time with a 10-gallon tank.  One batch and it's already overcrowded, so be prepared to get many more tanks just to house them all!<br>  Now after having said that, tetras like to to be in schools of 6 fish of same breed.  That would be enough for a 10-gallon tank.<br>  If you add guppies, only get males.|`|xUNwC1B8aa	I would say about 8 total between the two types at the very most for a 10 gallon. Less if you want to do less is better but keep at least 3 of each kind with each other.<br>  <br>  Be aware that they are active live breeders and will most likely become pregnant and give birth many times in the life of the aquarium and that will effect the load of fish on your tank and if they fish get eaten by the others in the tank or not will effect this as well. But good choices for that size of tank, sounds fun and good luck to you. :)|`|9fEeteY0aa	The rule I've heard was "A gallon of water per inch of fish"<br>  <br>  But you should wait and read the other answers, since I'm not sure how true it is.<br>  <br>  Make sure to cover your tank with a mesh top, though! Tetras are known to launch themselves out of the water.

We don't know for sure how all this got started, but all life on Earth eventually goes back to molecules that figured out how to self-replicate. I say "figured out", but they had no volition or plan. They could've got their start in the nasty goop that hung out in tide pools waaaaayyyyyy back in the day, or they could've come from asteroids crashing into our planet. Who knows? So those pigs are our cousins. just a little farther from our particular branch than others.<br>  <br>  So pigs came from earlier species that gradually evolved into them, and those earlier species came from earlier ones, and on back to the slime, same as for us. Pigs were domesticated from wild boars. There's some evolution in action for you- domestication and animal breeding. <br>  <br>  so what we know for sure is pigs come from boars with selective breeding and befor bores we speculate an early mamal then an ooze or molecule collection of some sort

KToEYmwWaa	I think getting a new rats asap is a good idea, but I would worry that it would be very stressful to Lily.  Probably your best bet is to allow Fern to be alone for a little while and give her lots of love and attention and let her grieve (they grieve just like humans).  Then after a couple weeks get her a new friend.  It will probably be hard on her to accept a new rat because Lily will never be replaceable, but over time they will form their own bond.  This is always such a sad situation.  Just a bit of advice though, if you find a really good vet, they can spay female rats and this greatly reduces the chances of tumors.  It is expensive but I'm sure you'll agree that it's better than watching you little girl get sick :( <br>  <br>  I wish you, Lily, and Fern the best of luck.|`|OhpbLfdraa	it would be better if you stayed time with her when lily dies you should spend time with her like for 2 weeks because if you immediately buy another rat fern may become aggresive with the new rat because he/she is not going to know the new rat and he will miss lily very much after those 2 weeks you can try buying a new rat and let them meet each other carefully so they can become friends just like fern and lily it is  really probably they will become friends really fast bacause rodents are really social animals and thay like to be with each other but you also have to understand that fern is going to be really sad because he was probably really close to lili and he will miss her...good luck|`|TOGgD7XAaa	definatly, i have ha three rats and as soon as one dies, i get sad and so does my other rat.

But if you don't, your only rat may die before his time due to loneliness.<br>  <br>  So the best idea would be to buy another rat, although they may not get along at first, everything takes time. And try to get a rat that is around the same age as your current rat, age makes quite a bit of difference, or so I have heard from a Pet Specialist.
