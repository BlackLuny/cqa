20090203084526AAQbHx9	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Waiting for a 1099 and thinking it won't come...?	we are sort of in a pickle....my dh works a regular full time job, he did a side job for a company and agreed to be 1099'd since he hadn't set up any kind of official business - no tax id no or what not. so the owner said he would 1099 him this year. thats fine.      but we need to do our taxes and we have all of our doc's EXCEPT, of course, the 1099 that we need. AND since it will effect our overall return, i don't want to do our taxes and amend them down the road when it finally comes, cuz we will owe the gov't about $600 in taxes (i believe)....anyway, everything i read says he was supposed to have them mailed out by jan 31st - but its the 3rd of feb. and nothing.   i feel like the owner of this company is just dragging his feet to be a jerk and my dh has ALREADY mentioned to him in a few emails that he would be willing to work for him and finish this project (its computer related) and 'oh by the way, we are waiting for that 1099'....kind of thing...but we hear nothing back....which is why my dh stopped bothering with him to begin with!!! my dh had to literally sit outside his door waiting to catch him on the way to the bathroom --to get this gentleman to talk to him about ANYTHING...it was just too frustrating and he walked away from the project...he was only paid for worked he did DO - but there is a lot more to be done (which was never paid for)...so i don't think the owner really has gripe with him, just being lazy or (his usual) 'too busy' to think about it.      anyway, any ideas on this situation?  we don't know how long we should wait before we just give up and do our taxes anyway? and if we do our taxes april 15th and it comes in the mail july 5th, is it our fault or the employers????      sorry so long.

There was a 0% apr for 12 months on the card and the highest balance charged on the card, over time was $3200.   After the 12 months the APR will be 10.99%.   If I do not have the credit card at a balance of zero in time (by 12 months) they will of course charge me interest (deferred) for the previous months.  Do you know how much interest will be if I do not get the balance down to zero in time?

However due to the weather at the moment the school has been closed the last 2 days and will still be closed tomorrow. With the weather situation at the moment I won't be surprised if it is still going to be closed for the rest of the week. Usually I don't get paid over school holidays. Since this is an exceptional case I can't even look it up on my contract. Can I expect to get paid? I know I'd ask the agency but I'm sure they'll say no if I don't want to discuss that with them without knowing how to challenge them. Please help!

20090203110144AAg81yj	Business & Finance;Credit	Which would better increase the chance of an auto loan approval?	We applied for an auto loan and was denied due to too much debt already (we just had a baby a few weeks ago) but are receiving our tax return this week. We are paying off two of our biggest debts and still have about $1400 left over. Would it be better to put the $1400 toward the car and reduce the loan amount we're asking for, or to pay it on our student loan (the only other debt we have aside from the loan on our only other car) and drastically reduce the amount owed on it so it shows we have less debt? Any advice would be appreciated. We really need two vehicles with a baby, especially since the first is a 2 door and the trunk is so small the stroller won't even fit in it!      Also, does anyone know how long it would take to show on our credit report that those loans/debts have been paid off?
