ec38f4feb12dd01422eeeeb1fa7ed784aa	Alas I am afraid you do, under the Health and Safety Act 1974 Chapter 16 paragraph 14a sub clause 3b ( disposal of servants in pursuance of their masters wishes) clearly states that at all times a safety net must be provided when shooting servants from circus cannons. However, it does not say that the infernal contraption should be rigged, indeed it doesn't even require it to be there, just available. So shoot away old chap and have a good time. If I might be so bold as to ask permission to send my man Cuthbertson over for a test shoot, at 94, he is quite expendable and with luck you can get several shoots out of him before he expires.|`|ZcaC37sZaa	Of course you need the net, can you imagine the damage to the lawn and shrubbery, be more considerate of you gardner, man.|`|Kry7Nd30aa	I fear the housemaid will travel farthest, as habitual behavior bestows you, I gather she's always in the buff. Purely for efficiency regarding her work of course. Don't want the old girl sweating up now do we?|`|NZMqEciEaa	   A safety net is not required for these purposes. A safety net is only required if you have lied, cheated, deceived, absconded,overspent or mismanaged your, or anyone else's, money.Then the government(s) will try to make things right by spending the money everyone has lost or stolen or never had, to help those who cheated, deceived, absconded, overspent or mismanaged their or your money.The "fall back to earth", of your servants is part of the system of "divide and die!" system. Invest in Enron stock and trust Lehman Bros.|`|d168T6xvaa	No need for a net.You've mentioned you have a lake on your property.Simply aim the cannon there,so they'll be shot into the water.Makes it more interesting,especially if they can't swim.|`|30e7b808304ee867ce23c80d9216a4c6aa	From personal experience, I have found that a safety net is a total waste of money. You never know where the little blighter's going to land and you can guarantee that the net is never in the right place.    If I were you, I'd buy an extra case of champers for you and your chums and tell the serf to wrap himself in his flocking mattress. I'm assuming you provide them with such things, I can't for one moment imagine you forking out for a SPRUNG mattress for the ..... servants! (ptch - spit!).    Of course, if you're worried that it might look 'uncaring', you could always purchase head gear suitable for such an occasion. A tin hat of the WW2 variety would suffice I'm certain! You could even save yourself the money and use an old Peak Freans Water Biscuit tin. Stuff the lad's head in it, bash it about a bit to give it some shape and tie it on with a bit of bind-a-twine .... no problem!    Any possibility of an invitation? |`|xsRNvuINaa	 When I fire my staff,it's usually via a Howitzer! It is a hell of a lot more messier than a circus cannon,but I can assure you I have no comebacks legally,what so ever ! As to your situation sir,why the need for a safety net???|`|8BnaQrbdaa	   Not at all. Just take a lavish amount of Larva from a Mexican     Jumping Bean Moth and apply it rather generously to the soles of     their shoes and to the seat of their pants.    The cannonball will, no doubt, put them into the orbit, but once there     the Larva will take over, and then you just watch them take off and    add to the entertainment. Why spoil it by making them land when     they can soar and soar to new heights. |`|tEKqQj9gaa	To enhance the entertainment have the oldest of your house staff catch your human balls, If they fail to do so they must be fired from the cannon.|`|EWMQxpUAaa	you should have a safety net|`|ToVrhtraaa	you obviously need one if you don't want them to die. you will be i a lot of legal trouble if the servant gets hurt. if the servant dies that's even worse.|`|Xn1koGZPaa	Jolly good fun that is.  One would suggest requiring said servants to wear added protection.  Like say, a parachute or extra fluffy jacket.|`|rq8LbaQQaa	I wouldn't worry about a net at all, as the bounce upon landing would be just as entertaining as the actual flying through the air. and you could always use that as a side bet|`|HltUWMgOaa	If you fired them across the lake there would be no need for a net. If you got the angle right you might be able make them skip like a stone. Just think of the wagers you could have.  Jolly good fun. what?|`|oQ2Rn2hpaa	Yes, a net of some kind might be a wise precaution.  I recommend Boots The Chemist's economy hairnet pack - 75p for 2.  That way, when the servants hurtle past you, your hairstyle will remain unruffled.  Have a lovely day!|`|JPjsctU9aa	Do not forget to record this jolly good time.    To answer, a safety net is COMPLETELY optional.   IF you want to replace them, go ahead. Simply buy them life and health insurance and you're free.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Rotter.  Titanic, ice bergs, swedish twins, old ladies.  Just send me what drink you drink.|`|WT9cjXtIaa	I would gather that seeing them fly is your entertainment.

So spread some hay in the field and have at it!|`|AA11900069	fire the cannon at the road, and the Highways Agency will clean up any mess.  It works for me.|`|qdPtCBJeaa	You were a bad kid in school weren't you??|`|RluCMVUSaa	Of course a net is not needed, that would deter the fun. Up the wager by providing each servant an alternative safety measure. You not only wager as to which servant will go furthest, but also the most amusing "landing" and the best safety device. My recommendations for the safety devices are an umbrella, a pillow case, a yellow rain coat and a duck call (entertainment value only, I suggest this to the least liked servant), a pool float, a kite and a sheet. To quite any quibblingg you may suggest a perk to the wining servant, such as unlimited hot water usage for a week.  Just in case, you may want to contact a temp agency as well, you would not want to be bothered by the lack of service a broken hireling can create.  Happy cannoning to you!

WcBoKbQ5aa	deccopage (yeah i know i spelled that wrong lol) it's super easy and fun and people love it! mix 1 part elmer's glue to 2 parts warm water and mix very thoroughly. it should be almost clear but cloudy, but if it isn't runny, you need to add more water. it shouldn't be gloppy or thick. cut out pictures or words from magazines, newspapers, print something out, etc. make sure they're things that describe the person or send a message. it's a good idea to lay down some colored tissue paper for a background first. dip the paper pieces in the mixture and stip excess of with your fingers, then put it on a wood box, a picture frame, or whatever you want. when you're finished putting the paper on, paint a thin coat of the glue mixture on with a paint brush. let it dry completely (it shouldn't take long). when it's dry, you can add other things to the top, like dried flowers, beads, or anything else you want. if they're thin, you can just attach them the same was as the paper. if it's something like a dried flower, apply a small bit of blue to the bottom and glue it on, then paint it with the glue mixture. anything else should just be glued. if you want to add a glossy finish, paint over it with the glue. this is a project that makes a great gift and is pretty much free!    other than that, you can buy some inexpensive jewelry, maybe a giftcard to her favorite store, some cds or itunes giftcards, or anything else you can think of. good luck! hope i helped =D|`|3ffb3b89c4d7e5f341def84b65cd6d10aa	rope...don't ask|`|BjGa5Mklaa	jewellry   ring  necklace  earing   bracelet    school stuff  pencil case and pencils and all that stuff  bag   books|`|WEeJoq4oaa	jus get a big black dildo...nothing fancy...just oneof the rubber ones theyll come in handy !TRUST ME!|`|FTVfHor8aa	If you have a colour printer and some photo-glossy paper, download a photo image of her favourite group, singer, actor, etc. from the net and print out.

AA11993919	It can be important, but don't rely too heavily on it. Your opponent could present you with a big surprise revealing the weakness of your opening, and you basically spend the whole game defending instead of attacking(though defense can win a game, too). My advice is too study each opening, and learn its weakness and strengths, and how each can lead to a solid middle game. |`|AA11900069	Because your opponent will have one!  You have to have an over-view, right from move 1.  I start with my knights taking median squares, then establish a diagonal fence of pawns...  I seek to pressurise with my knights, I castle, and after keeping up a strong defence, I try to judge the moment to push for a major assault on one third of the board.  I triple-team pieces i want to take, and then make a push for the enemy king.      I have progressed from being creamed by Level 1 on my chess program, up to a 76% win rate on level 4.  I can occasionally win at level 5.|`|qQ3SLjHHaa	Very important.  Basically you get the centerfield in hand so you have good access to everywhere on board.    Surprise is sometimes good too, especially if you play against someone who's a beginner  and/or inebriated.

En tout cas, avec un jeu PAL, la console devrait reconnaitre la zone d'origine du jeu et donc te proposer le PSN adquat.    Mais rien n'est certain, c'tait seulement pour t'aider.

OZ0DgzrJaa	WoW is a monthly supscription-based program, you HAVE TO have your own copy of the game and your own account to play.  That account has to be linked to a valid credit card, or game card.    Because of that, this isn't a game you can pirate, and Blizzard takes great joy in deleteing accounts that they find out are pirated.    To create an account, install Wow.  When you first start it up it will ask you if you want to create and account or use a pre-existing one.  Choose create and you can create a user name and password while adding a payment method for use after the first free month expires.    (Note that your characters names' and your user account name do not have to match. You can name your characters anything that isn't vulger or heavily copyrighted.)

0970ccb714dfc02b7b183f3f7b73baaeaa	Emulators basically run a program on your PC that emulate the functions and processes of an old console. There are emluators for most of the popular consoles such as SNES, NES, GB, Genesis and MD. Now there are two parts you'll need in order to experience the old days of console gaming, you'll need the emulator program (hardware), and you'll need the ROM (software). Think of the emulator as buying the console, and the ROM as the games themselves. ROMs are hard to come by, so you might not find the game you're looking for. Try www.romnation.net for both ROMs and emulators.    Keep in mind that it is still ILLEGAL to download any ROM that you don't personally own. But like mp3s, I leave that decision up to you. ;)|`|qh2BXVZLaa	emulator can be a software or a computer chips.

bqpcecWXaa	I don't think that any game is bad for anybody as long as they don't imitate the actions that are occurring in the video game. I think she will be just fine. I started paying those type of games when I was just about her age and I turned out perfectly fine. Although, the The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rated the entire Halo series M for (Mature) because they consider the content is only suitable for persons ages 17 and older. But titles in this category(shooters) may usually contain intense violence, blood and gore, and sometimes strong language. The decision usually depends on the parent or guardian. Hope my answer help out! =D|`|ZWh1eQu2aa	yeah its appropriate  my little cousin whos 5 plays it with me all the time she loves co op cause i can help her  there is a little bit of cussing and alien blood but nothing to bad  it shouldnt be rated M|`|eyLyRenuaa	No is has to much violence and is rated M for mature.|`|BkxwJi3Qaa	i say halo's fine, pretty fun. just make sure she doesnt play it way too much|`|itabVvIMaa	Yeah Halo isn't very bloody and my friend is 8 and he plays it and I played it when I was 11(I'm twelve now not very different though).|`|CLmCxZniaa	YEAH|`|LNEWbymsaa	It actually depends... I LOVE HALO... but it depends on what you see as apropriate because compared to other games [ call of duty; left for dead; etc.] halo is actually very good!!|`|4c4LVaWEaa	wat do u think?  its rated M for mature(17+)  if ur a parent, its up 2 u  if ur a child, tell ur parents|`|yC9TKKghaa	well shes moving kind of fast to be already watching and playing that stuff so if u LET her do it already than its too late to be innappropriate|`|TsGq6aseaa	Well if you mind the unfriendly enviroment.|`|2Hg1O6uEaa	UMM........... Do i don't think that it's that appropriate i am older than that and i don't like it and plus it for 17 and up but if all u people want to know 1 of the reasons its M its because of live. I would Say NO!|`|p5khDWB7aa	if she watches gory movies then yeah... even if she didnt it would be fine.  there not really a lot of blood. just a little when you shoot people. and im pretty sure that there is a setting to turn the gore off. over all its not a very violent game.  but its an awesome game i would highly recommend it.|`|7SLjU62Baa	Games come with ratings.|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	Use your brain, they're all rated M.|`|i7axq25Maa	it depends how mature you are. but my bro has a mike and ppl can talk REALLY dirty on it, so i dont know.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	All 3 Halo's would be appropriate for a 11 year old. They're not bad at all.. it's not even THAT gory.|`|i8NZNgLPaa	I'm 11. On live if you could turn off the swearing then yes.|`|SBcxooLsaa	yes it is like some like 7 year olds play halo go on youtube theres this like 4 year old owning evveryyone on halo lol there all cussing at him calling him a hacker lol|`|3Jd9dGJgaa	Well, it doesn't really matter what Halo game you get for her (Halo Combat Evolved, 2, or 3). All three do have violence and mild language usage. If you say that she is used to seeing a lot of gore and scary movies, she'll be fine playing the game. I would most likely recommend Halo 3 because it is the most recent of the three and has the best graphics. Halo is REALLY not as bad as some adults think it is for their children. It includes a very interesting story line, A LOT of skill and brain power to complete on hard difficulties, and enjoyable game play. However, if you do get her the game and allow her to play online, make sure you keep an eye on her because she is still young and online play can be mentally challenging with older players.    Hope I could help!|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Uhhh Yeah , You Kidding ?  Halo Is Awesome :D|`|9RA6ugRbaa	YEAH|`|M8kNmWuAaa	The only one ive played is halo 1:combat evolved. Theres no real reason it should be rated m.

AA10119905	If you like crack, yes.  If you have an addictive personality and want to keep your social life, I wouldn't play it.  It's very addictive.  I've played it for 4 years.  It's very fun, you meet some cool people, but it's easy to become obsessed.  There's a reason it's so phenomenally successful.  It's worth every cent you pay.  But it can suck you in.    You buy the initial game.  There's also two expansions, so you'll eventually want those too.  I'd buy the Battle Chest for $40.  It contains the main game and the first expansion.  You get at least the first month free.  After that, it costs $15 a month.  It's worth the cost.      Actually, if I were you, I'd sign up for the free 10-day trial.  Try it out yourself and see what you think.  There's a lot of good resources for new players.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	i dont think it is because it cost so much but runescape is awsome because it is free and u can play 5 dollars a month to get a membership. and no u dont have to install anything on ur computer toplay it.    runescape.com|`|NjWKbAfSaa	It depends on what sort of games you're into really, if you like RPGs then you'll probably find it fun.    You have to pay the initial fee to buy the game then there's an additional subscription fee every month.|`|GexnMFKGaa	It's fun if you like an MMORPG that you can just pick up and put down whenever you want.    It's boring if you think doing the same quests for 60 levels isn't fun (I personally get bored).  I have more fun in Final Fantasy XI because it has a more rich story line, and not all of the quests are exactly the same for 70 levels.  But it's good if you have nothing to do and you just wanna hop on for an hour or two.    Yes, you'll have to pay monthly, $10/month.  Decent deal, 'cause you can make as many extra characters as you want, unlike other MMOs.|`|Kr1PY4PTaa	YES its fun i have a dk and man the power they have lol its super great

The designs are made for cards so not only are you doing a craft that is quick and easy (for those of us who like instant gratification) you can sell, share, give these cards for ANY occasion.  You'll never have to buy another card again and they are fun because you can add and do anything to them. I like to add different paper colors under it and shape them with ridged scissors.     Here is a link a book with patterns.

p7w5p7pVaa	The order of play in a game is usually decided by each player rolling a single die with the highest number throwing first, the second highest throwing second and so on. If an equally high number is thrown by two or more players they throw again. Seating may be rearranged so that the dice are always passed to the left (clockwise). Alternatively the player with the highest throw starts and the other players take their turns in a clockwise direction, regardless of what number they threw, without the trouble of reorganising players positions. Some games are exceptions to the rule and have their own particular method for determining order of play. These exceptions are described in the text.    want to try other casino games?    http://www.betterbettingonline.com/|`|xA0tsAr0aa	well i played this tons of times and lost  but wat u have to do is roll two dice and the one that gets the higher number wins the competition  there three rounds the kind i played it

6NQcoowPaa	That's hard to say, most official webkinz dealers are raising their prices now, i only wish i new why. So, you are going to have a hard time finding a webkinz for under 10. (most webkinz are $14.99) If you want to stay low on the prices you might want to get a little kinz for around 12 bucks.   You can also try ebay if you want because most times you can get a pretty good deal on some if you time it right. You just have to be careful you are buying a webkinz with an unused tag because most on ebay are just the plush.    God Luck! =)  --Fortune Cookie|`|nXTDkokuaa	I'm a huge fan of webkinz until I came across http://www.webkinzdiscount.com/  this might help you out with your webkinz stuffed animal collection.

They also offer this service to many other poker sites and its completly free. another great thing about this is they may offer you $100 but first you would only get $50. after making so many points you would get another $50 and be able to cash out.

If they don't obligate to finding your account again, just threaten them that you will tell everyone you know that Blizzard games are bad and to spread the news. It worked for me ;-)    Good Luck.

bwQaIGpZaa	Looks like you should have 24 stitches on your needle going into row 19.      "Row 19: K 2, yo twice, (k 3, yo twice) three times, k2 yo twice, (k 3 yo twice) three times,K 2"    Here's Row 19 with each stitch written out:    K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K K (loop your yarn around your needle twice) K K    You should have 40 "stitches" on your needle, but only 24 that you actually knit.  The rest are your loops that you will be dropping in the next row.    "Row 20: P 2, drop both yo (eyelet made), (p3 drop both yo) three times, p 2, drop both yo, (p 3 drop both yo) three times, p 2"    Written out this looks like:    P P (drop the two loops) P P P (drop the two loops) P P P (drop the two loops) P P P (drop the two loops) P P (drop the two loops) P P P (drop the two loops) P P P (drop the two loops) P P P (drop the two loops) P P    You should again have 24 stitches on your needle.|`|AA12042448	When it says (k3 yo twice) three times, it means you do everything inside the parentheses three times.

SzepLJubaa	You do not need to pay extra money for the upgrade.    Do the following if you have the store copy expansion:    1) Download and install the store copy of BC or WotLK.  2) In the middle of the download, it will ask you the username/pass of the account you wish to upgrade.   3) Put in the user/pass.  4)After the download and the super long patch after it is complete, you are all set!     This is what I did when I upgraded to BC, but I'm not really sure about WotLK. Good Luck ;-)
L8NIQmATaa	it should do that however i quit imob due to the glitching, play imafia its so much better..you can actually get respect points without buying it
rhANJ8nuaa	On the main menu there is a button on the top left. Once the console reads a disk it should light up and say 'Start Application' when you move on it. Press that and the game should load. If you just reset the console it should load the game without going to the menu first if i remember correctly.  If the game disk is not reading the Saturn might be faulty or the disk is scratched. Good Luck.

j0a1v9TZaa	Go to yard sales, garage sales, vintage/antique shops, Goodwill, Salvation Army stores, back of pattern books in the costume sections.      Ask Grandparents and old neighbors if they have any old hats.  I was once at a household auction where there were ladies hats from 100 years before.  I had no idea the owner would have had anything like those.      One friend who has a hat collection displays them in the bathroom on walls starting at the ceiling with small nails.  Good luck and have fun collecting these!|`|MeQHkPB1aa	i'd start by going to antique stores and garage sales.  i'm sure you could find some crazy ones.  i love hats from the early 1900s to like 1950s|`|eJIucizyaa	Most construction company's hand them out for nothing all you have to do is ask,they like to advertise.  Unless you are looking for a specific hat.  Be aware that 366 will be quite a hat collection and will take a bit of area to hang them all up or else they will become all wrinkled and deformed.  The garage sales was a very good answer.  Good Luck

Dso7k3sjaa	When is it telling you that you need a certain system?  Have you already extracted the files out of the zip or rar folder which they came in?    Here's a link to a tutorial that can teach you how to download and install custom content:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    When you first start reading that link, it seems as though it's only talking about PC's instead of Mac computers, but it also gives information about how to do it on a Mac as well.    As long as you have already gone into the game options and told it to enable custom content and then exited after you did that so those changes can take effect, then yes.    If this is the very first piece of custom content that you have ever put into your game, then after you get into a neighborhood, click on the options (...) and then on the icon that looks like cog wheels.  That's where you need to make sure the game will show the custom content in the game catalogs and if you have Nightlife or any newer ep, there will something to the right of that about showing a dialog box on start up.  You can either leave that enabled, or disable it.  Doesn't matter.  Below that you'll see a white star.  Click on it and make sure that Custom Content is marked.    Then, you have to exit for that change to take effect.  Once you have done that, you should be able to find the cc in the game.  If it's a sim then you'll find it when you make a sim in the Create A Family section -- it will be in the sim bin.  The sim bin in CAF looks like six little sims in the upper right hand corner of the screen where you see a sim standing there.

c3nyypRmaa	Yes they stay just as cute as the day you got them.   I have a miniature poodle named Sophie Noel she is 8 and a tan kind of color.       Toy poodles are so adorable but if you want something small        (REALLY SMALL) get a teacup poodle they are as small as a stuffed animal. But if you get a teacup poodle or a toy poodle you can't sit on them accidently it kills them as quick as can be. :(    They need a doll dog dish and they need a very small brush and please give them baths in the sick.   They are so adorable when they are older.  It's best if the toys you use aren't bones because they can choke them.  Don't give her any more treats 1 a day that could make them very VERY sick it give them diarrhea.   Don't sleep with them under any conditions.  They should either have a crate or a dog bed or both! :)  Witch either one you pick they both are very cute.  Toy poodles get cuter everyday you have them as long as you love them.  Teacup poodles are very small but they are very energetic and very good with kids.  Good luck with the puppy!|`|ncSd9jXDaa	since when have toy poodles been cute??|`|Xm5ab6F6aa	I am fostering a tea cup poodle (4 years or so) now for a no kill shelter, she was in a breeding farm that got busted in AL. It has taken me a month and half to bring her around to being a happy dog she is a great little 6lb black poodle. The first night she came to me she had 4 pups which all died because she was so skinny and under feed, I am used to birth pups I tried everything to save them.    She is a great sport house broke very easly, learn what treats are and toys. I have 5 Bichons which as well are non- sheeding dogs and she jumps over them and out runs all. Great fun little dog.|`|VGzi6KaFaa	no...|`|4npjIcPaaa	yes. if they are toy they always stay the same size.(well pretty much the same) & LMAO at your category. :)|`|2wptPP8xaa	My Mother had those yappy dogs,they weren't that friendly.|`|eyQBvbzraa	i am sure that they are and guess what...poodles dont shed. so you little mini dog will always be tiny and cute and will never shed which is a big plus.|`|HUskSEm6aa	yes, very..i have one|`|xp40696saa	i think they all r ugly. they r too puffy.|`|gypCmdWqaa	it depends yes if you keep then groomed  otherwise no they get nasty  you really have to clean there eyes like every few days     alot of upkeep|`|XDG9y8Aiaa	Yes they are very, tho i recommend getting a black one if your going for looks, white ones can look a bit scraggly when they get older, and brown ones just look like mutts.  Don't pick your puppy for just looks tho, make sure you pick a breeder with propper  credentials and that the parents have had proper health checks, look at the past puppy records, and never ever pick a timid puppy, they may look cute and u may feel sorry for it but timid puppies become a huge problem when they grow up. and dont go to puppy farms they are cruel places.stick with the breeders|`|zAlFrR87aa	Yeah they stay super cute and look almost the same as when u got them!!

KAuPPyxDaa	Cards like Mind Control was very useless before since when you control your opponent's monster, you cannot use it to attack or tribute. BUT today in 2009, the card does not say you can't use it for synchro summon, therefore the card's price went 5 times higher. Royal Oppression was use to be like a ****. Now it's like almost 10 dollars canadain for ONE.|`|mHWsuqjZaa	they sure are! they make of the best combos|`|XiOfPxpdaa	only HALF the old cards are unuseabul sevral of em can make grate combos are are even stronger then what they were befor thanx to new posibul combos, blue-eyes is no longer useabul but black magicain has become stronger tank to the new spellcasters in crossrode of caus the spell fusion now has a grate primer use in the hero deck even the gods they made 6 new gods based after the origanal and are legal in tornements theas are em and thair sats;    ravail lord of phantasms - dark, feind efect, 4000 attack, 4000 effenc, level 10,  efect - this card can only be summond by tributing 3 feind monsters, each time your oponent summons a monster you summon 1 "phantasam token" "dark, feind, level 4, 1000 attack, 1000 deffenc" the tokens can't attack by tributing a monster increas this card's attack by the tribute monster's attack till the end of the turn, this card is unefected by traps      homon lord of striking thunder - dark, thunder efect, level 10, 4000 attack, 4000 deffenc,  efect - this card can only be summoned by tributing 3 spell cards, if this monster is face up on your side this monster is the only monster your oponent can attack, when this monster destroys a monster by battle infilct 1000 damge to the oponbent's LP, this card is vunefected by spells    uria lord of searing flames - fier, pyro efect, level 10, 0 attack, 0 deffenc  efect - this monster can only be summoned by tributing 3 traps, once per turn destroy 1 spell or trap the oponent controls, this monster gains 1000 attack and deffenc for each trap in your grave, when this card is destroyed you can revive it at the end of the turn by discarding 11 trap from your hand    the wiked avitar - dark, feind efect, level 10, 0 attack, 0 deffenc  efect - this monster can't be spashal summoned, when this monster is summoned the oponent can't use any spells or traps for 2 turns, this card attack and deffenc id 100 ponts higher then the origanal attack of the strongest monster on the feild other then another wiked avitar    wiked ereaser - dark, feind efect, level 10, 0 attack, 0 deffece,  efect - this monster can't be speshal summoned, this card's attack and deffenc is 1000 for evry card on your oponent's side of the feild if this card is sent to the grave both players must discard all the cards i  thair hand and all cards on the feild are destroyed|`|wCGeer97aa	yes|`|o18WpWoUaa	.... yes... why wouldnt they be? 5d's is just the name of the tv series|`|VM5cTP4Jaa	Yes you can play with them of course but you will need to remember some new terms cos the fusion zone is now called the extra zone.Some cards also have their text changed,generally the old ones but it is still the same thing.|`|YJsBrnnaaa	you have to look at the banned list to see what is playable.
Zt2wk1FJaa	Just as one of the answerers had mentioned, you may be describing:    Provocraft CRICUT (three different types of Cricut machines, same purpose....cuts letters and shapes)....I own the small one and large one  (it is a great tool...they just came out with the medium size known as "Cricut Create")    THE SLICE  (check out www.memorymakingcrafts.com for video demo & details) This is a new one (I still like the cricut).    Then there's a third type of machine, same principle (forgot the name).    Check out another website for details and prices just to get an idea of what's out there re: scrapbooking and tools.    www.ohmycrafts.com  www.provocraft.com  (makers of the Cricut products & accessories)  www.cricut.com (specifically re: this machine)|`|UbwatASSaa	maybe the craftlite cutter???|`|f11cbdf4e19d96094d2aff5f280df68faa	cricut. i have one and it is awesome
4Vy7eeglaa	To build, you need to have control more supply centers than you have units at the winter adjustments phase.    If you have more units than supply centers at winter adjustments then you remove (disband) units. You may opt to disband a unit rather than retreat if dislodged and you may be forced to disband a unit if it is dislodged without a valid retreat or if you retreat to a province to which another unit retreats.    What you can *not* do is elect to disband a unit so that you can build a different one.
URo0IzMpaa	i just figured out street tunes it is "available"
3f573edfebb558b3d5840168b36252edaa	First of all, congratulations on finishing the tutorial. You've walked your first steps into becoming a legitimate RuneScape player. Well done.     Chat room, hmm... I don't recall there ever being a chat room but if you mean the chat box at the bottom-left corner of your screen, that simply shows you your ingame messages from players, the game's messages, trades, request assists, and allows you to report other players for breaking the rules (childish, I know).     After completing the tutorial, you may begin your adventure in the the wonderful world we call Gielinor. You don't begin with much. There are numerous things you can start out doing: training skills, starting quests, or exploring and learning about the game. There are numerous guides on how to start out, but I'll suggest one of my personal favorites; the Tip It Beginners' Guide:   http://tip.it/runescape/?page=beginners_...    After reading the guide, you may begin familiarizing yourself with RuneScape's interfaces and game play. Getting farther in the game is easy. I find it easiest to set your own goals, such as a certain skill level or a certain amount of an item (like GP, RuneScape's form of currency). However, you can choose whatever kind of goal you want.     RuneScape, as with most other MMORPG's, is a non-linear game. This means that there is no precise way to "beat the game" as there is in other console games like Call of Duty or Mario Kart. Simply do what you want to; may this be adventuring, questing, or skilling. Set goals and complete them, and you'll soon be finding your own purpose in the game.    P.S. Information on starting quests and training skills can be found in the guide I posted a link to. If you haven't already, click on it and your questions will be satisfied.|`|SBcxooLsaa	walk around look for the people who give quests like the cook you walk to other towns if your going to varrock dont go near the dark mages  ok  and just go around looking for the cook the farmers go around until you no everywhere find high level friends who will help you out look for people with crowns if you dont understand add goodmage127 but tell me your name im barely on though just to let you know|`|qNYzCKaZaa	Ok for starters, the chat box down the bottom of the screen will stay there permanently, so dont worry so much about that... now, talk to the wizard after youve completed the tutorial, he will send you to the mainland. You will land in Lumbridge Castle. Here is the first thing that i did, walk out the main gate of the castle and onto the street, turn left and you should see a big question make (this wizard will explain a few things if you are still confused. Keep following this road until you see a small brown pot icon, this is the general store. Go in here and buy a World Map. This should prevent you from getting lost.     To do quests, click on the little Star icon on your menu screen, a list of quests will come up, to see where the quest begins just click on the name of the quest, the one closest to you will be back in the Lumbridge Castle, this is the easiest one and you dont have to travel far to complete it, so i suggest you start here.     There is no real end to this game, the idea of it is to develop your skills and make money, complete quests ect. The more you level up your skills, the more things you are able to do. I have an account and am happy to show you the ropes. Let me know and i can log in:)|`|1WLSNzCSaa	To get of the island talk to the wizard and ask him to teleport you to the mainland.After this you have to explore the world and do what you want.The main point is to get the highest level possible and be the best player. On the runescape ting pick the icon that says quests and click on any one and it will tell you how to start one. The more you do (quests,up levels,more money) the more things will be available to you.|`|qD6h8GVyaa	You have to go to the shire and talk to Saruman.

For fishing/cooking, you need a small fishing net and a range or fire. Go to draynor (look on the map) and fish in the fishing spots. For woodcutting/firemaking, you need a bronze axe and a tinderbox. Go to almost anywhere where there are trees and cut. After, you can chose to keep the logs or burn them with the tinderbox. For mining/smithing, you need a bronze pickaxe and a hammer. Go to the mine in Lumbridge Swamp with the question mark (look on the map). Mine and then find a furnace (looks like a furnace in Al-Kharid, look on the map). Use the bars on the anvil (two are in Varrock, looks like an anvil on map). You do quests by clicking on the star button on the tabs. Then, click on the quest you want to do and follow the instructions. The main point of the game is to level up the skills you most enjoy and to have FUN!

These two decks have been designed already to win a tournament. ( for me at least )  They have really great cards too. Or you can get the Lord of the Storm deck, which is about the same price. Its a good deck, but its hard to play. The DD deck is a useful deck which you can build on, but might cost a lot. Try and not buy those new decks, ex. 5Ds.  These types of decks are cheap and soon be banned.   I suggest those decks though ...|`|QK50ERDJaa	I SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE 2 ZOMBIE WORLD DECKS IN COMBINATION WITH STRUCTURE DECK 2 (its a zombie deck as well) and you should be set. use mainly cards from the zombie world decks, all you need from structure deck 2 is vampire lord. so if you can find that card on its own for around 10$ your in good shape! but thats what all the noobs are doing with thier zombie decks. i combined mine with some old school cards i've had from back in the day. like Kuriboh, mirror force, monster reborn, and negate attack. make sure you put 3 books of life in it. but if zombie decks arnt your thing i suggest structure deck 4. fury of the deep. its one of the best put-together structure decks that i've seen so far. but if you dont like structure decks, grab some booster packs and slap a deck together. i've done that a few times and suprisingly i won quit a few tough matches like that. but w/e your style is, go with it!

SFNE also has Batman, The Dark Knight; Mind Eraser; and the Cyclone woodie among others. It's in western Mass. near Springfield, so it's an easy drive.     If you want to drive further, you can try Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, NJ. Depending on where you are in western MA, it might take 4 hours to get there. SFGA has more and bigger coasters than SFNE including Kingda Ka, the tallest in the world.     If you want to visit 2 parks, make the trip to SFGA, then go from there to Dorney Park near Allentown, PA.     ... or just bite the bullet and drive to Cedar Point in Ohio. From western MA on I-90 I'd guess the travel time to be around 9 hours. Cedar Point is one of the top coaster parks in the world.     peace|`|P4kae5A5aa	The above answer is spot on, both parks ROCK.

MN1xJSDiaa	Fable II is related nothing to Fable I accept that you play as a decedent of the character in Fable I. So no it is not needed to play the first one.          If you would like my opinion Fable II is a great game with a story line that makes you want to keep going. Plus most magazines and game websites say that Fable II is a 5/5,or a 9/10. My experiences with it are awesome and is very fun to play. I recommend it and in my and many others opinion Fable II is worth buying and is exciting.|`|1EL52GUuaa	It's worth buying, great gameplay and graphics. Also it has a lot of content. And no it's not really a sequel so you don't have to have played Fable 1.|`|enk57uOEaa	Fable II is a great game, it was one of the best game Xbox 360 have.and no you don't need to play Fable I first,The game is long and you can do almost anything in it.like story mode,change clothes,you decide between good or bad.you take decisions all the time,you can play online and all.

Hope it Works!|`|L8NIQmATaa	loved fable 2 however the glitches turned me off
sVPjp3dUaa	I agree with chanlin to a degree. Either one is fine for casual play. Here's what I've learned about precon decks. None of them have 1 or 2 big strengths, but they all do have ample weaknesses. This is done on purpose for a couple reasons. MTG wants to expose as many of their new cards as they can when a new set comes out. Precon decks will do that. They will show you as many new cards as possible, but they won't focus on any 1 particular card or combo. The creators will show you a theme or combo, but they leave it up to you to tweak the theme or combo in your own way. I suggest you play the deck as much as you can to figure out on your own which theme you like. Then you can decide how to add/switch cards so you make your new deck that much better. Also, try to keep the lands at 1/3 like chanlin said, 1/2 is just TOO MUCH unless you play a HEAVY mana dependent deck.|`|fPavekfeaa	If you are playing casually either deck is fine. Just pick whichever one sounds fun. The decks should have a description on the back of what their theme is and what they do.    If you intend to play in casual type II tournaments then go with Merrow Riverways as  Snake's Path is not type II legal currently.    As far as changing any cards out I would play with the deck a few times especially if this is your first time playing magic before trying to alter it. Altering a deck or building a deck effectively requires some understanding of how to play the game first.    Generally when building or altering a deck you want to choose cards that compliment its theme.    Also a good rule of thumb is to run 1/3 to 1/2 of the deck as land. You generally don't want to go under 1/3 of the deck (ie 20 cards in a 60 card deck) as being land as this can hurt your chances of being able to play cards simply because you haven't drawn any lands to play. This is especially true in decks that use multiple colors.

You know if the baby is happy by the hearts that pops up once you caress the baby. After that hold the rattle slightly above her head near her ear and just rattle till the baby turns her head.

Your teammate is opposite color, if he captures a piece he places it in front of you, instead of moving you may place "your" new piece on the board as long as it doesnt cause check or check mate. Both games are going on their own you dont have to wait on the other game to move or what not. If you win by checkmate thats 3 points for you 0 for opponent, win by forfiet 2 points and 0 points, draw 2-2 stalemate 1-1, scoring system could be adjusted. Also there is a thing called 3-d chess. and bobby fisher use to randomly place pieces on the board (only the first two rows for both side) and play normally.

qeu6vWCHaa	Xbox 360's are notorious for freezing up at random. They also get Disc Read Error's on newly released games, and have to patch it up to fix it. If your 360 freezes ALL the time, you should definitely excercise the warranty.    If it's once or twice every ~15-20 hours played you should think nothing of it.    Try keeping it elevated and the air vents clear. If it heats up it will freeze more often.
1YhbtB7Haa	Nope.    Your graphics card is integrated (built in to the motherboard), so your chances of running GTA IV on that is slim to none.    Here are the system specs:  OS: Windows Vista - Service Pack 1 / XP - Service Pack 3  Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8Ghz, AMD Athlon X2 64 2.4Ghz  Memory: 1.5GB, 16GB Free Hard Drive Space  Video Card: 256MB NVIDIA 7900 / 256MB ATI X1900    Besides, GTA IV is quad-core optimized. I've read on forums that many struggle to get good performance out of dual-core CPUs. Plus it uses up alot of RAM. 2+ RAM is best.    I have a Core2Quad Q8200 @ 2.33 Ghz, and even I struggle to get great performance. It's probably the most demanding PC game (performance-wise) available.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	By the looks of your specs    You have a STOCK GRAPHICS CARD...  and wont runt the game or either get a black screen        ....

CKY0rZUXaa	Go along with your parents. They have made their mind up on something, and will probably be really annoyed if you argue with them.     My advice is save up for your own PC/laptop (not a notebook), since Unreal tournament 2004 is a quite basic game graphicswise, so a basic PC should play it|`|3LPTLUczaa	That is the funniest excuse I have ever heard!! For a start, it only uses RAM when it is running and using RAM cannot harm your computer in any way. It is designed to be used!!    Is the hard drive close to being full? If not why does it matter? You can always un-install it if it gets full, or buy a new hard drive. It is possible to have more than 1 hard drive in a computer.     Now the virus excuse is my personal favourite, it is just so absurd!! Connecting to a game server is no more risky than going on any website. For a start why would these users PAY for a server to distribute virus? There are many easier and free methods to do so, email for example. Second, if you have an up to date anti-virus it doesn't matter anyway because it will just get deleted right away.     Why would virus makers target only gamers anyway!? People who play games online actually have computer experience and are going to be harder to fool for a start. They are also a very small part of internet users, one would assume the makers of these virus's would want to get it out to many many people, not just the few hundred people who play UT2004 online. The only way I can see you getting a virus on your pc from playing UT2004 is if you download bonus content (skins etc) from dodgy sites, or download cheats.    Your parents are obviously noobs and they are the ones more likely to download malicious content and harm the pc because of thier obvious lack of experience.    The only way installing UT2004 could slow down your pc is if the files need to be defragmented, in which case you run the defrag and problem is solved, uninstalling it will not help this, probably make it worse. without running a system defrag.    I would of course side with your parents if you are under the suggested 16 years of age to play the game.    Good luck!

Njom1Wbtaa	Before I proceed to the procedure of how to unblock your administrator security in that certain applications, there are things that I would like to confirm. There are:    1.) Are you using GT24 cable with the administrator's permission? If so, there is no way to unblock it.    2.) You need to buy an apparatus of devices to begin bugging the administrator's location. Try the DDR2, though it cost $2,000, with software of course, I guarantee you it will help you.    After this of what I said, the only way to unblock or terminate the security is to buy a cable wire (modern with 62 G+), go to pcworld.com ang try to download applications to change your IP address which corresponds to the devices you bought.

I like to get books from yard sales or second hand stores .|`|NWYdIIMHaa	Many excellent answers have already been given and this one will likely  repeat much of what has already been said but I'll try to add more....    I've been reading since I was in about the 4th grade.    I read both fiction and non-fiction.    For years I read mostly fiction. Even when reading a fiction book it is surprising the number of facts and trivia one can pick up. What kind of stories do you think you would like? There are romance, drama, adventure stories, spy, historical fiction, western, fantasy, science fiction, and more out there waiting for you to explore and discover.     There have been many times when I didn't click with an author. I tried to start reading a book but I just couldn't get into it. Don't let that kind of experience discourage you!! Move on and find another book and another author.    Even as an adult once in a while I might go over into the children's section to find a book to read. There are many good books that are more for older elementary through high school age children.    My mother in law loves to read those kinds of books but she also loves to read short stories. There are a lot of books available that are collections of short stories some are all by one author others are a collection from a variety of authors.    It sounds like you're not a reader so I would recommend starting off small. Choose a thin book that catches your interest. I would also recommend finding books at the library. The library is free to use so take advantage of it.     I read both fiction and non-fiction. What have you always wanted to know about, learn more about, or were curious about? Do you want to learn more about space, the planets, the universe? Do you want to learn more about a historic event or a particular time period? Do you want to know more about plants or animals? Do you want to learn how things are made? Do you want to learn how to make things yourself or how to draw or paint? Do you want to learn more about someone such as a well known leader, an inventor, an explorer? The library has it all!!    Non-fiction are the books about the real world. You can find books about just about anything at the library. Now and then I will read a biography about someone. When we homeschooled our children I learned right along with them. Children's books will simplify a topic. Then if I want to learn more I'll move on to books more suited for adults.    Most libraries have web sites that allow you to browse from home and you can reserve books while sitting at home. Sometimes the library doesn't give a good description of the book so I'll open another link and go over to Amazon.com and look it up there. They usually have a synopsis of the book and many times there are reviews by people who have read that book.    As for me a finished reading a book about Nikola Tesla (he invented alternating current which allows us to have electricity today, the first remote controlled submarine, was the first inventor of the radio, and so much more). Now I am reading a ficiton book. In fact it is the second I've read in a series. The next book after that will be another non-fiction book written by a retired FBI agent. Who knows what I'll be reading after that.    When I was in high school I read Gone With the Wind for the first time. By the time I graduated I had read that book 5 times. It is not for a book for someone who doesn't love to read or love that type of story.     If you want to start purchasing books you can get used books at thrift stores, garage sales, there are some places where you bring a book and can trade it free for another.    My husband and I have a collection of various types of books. We have the entire Left Behind series, mysteries, suspense, adventure, sci-fi, romance and more.    Ask friends and family what they are reading and enjoying. Sometimes when I'm talking to people they share what they're reading and it sounds interesting so I'll seek it out or ask if I can borrow it from them in the future.    Personally I don't generally read science fiction or fantasy books but my husband and mother in law both like science fiction. My two sons enjoy fantasy books. I prefer fiction stories that are about the real world. My husband and I both enjoy reading romance books, he reads them more than I do these days. I enjoy adventure, action stories, historical fiction sometimes.    So pick up a book that interests you and see where it takes you!!|`|9rdP7cmoaa	books are a doorway of imagination for the mind they keep us at ease dont let the media or friends tell u who u are be yourself|`|hwuamu91aa	read because the illiterate can destroy the world|`|kNTP6HWbaa	Reading is good for your brain, you get into a book by reading a good oone that you enjoy, find your type of reading|`|Vf8ADXitaa	used book stores are the best place to go. you dont get into every book. you really have to like what the book is about and enjoy reading it. its a good hobby bc you learn vocabulary, learn about people and how they interact, and its one of the most recommended ways to study for the s.a.t.|`|t043WEDIaa	to quote blind melon, "all i can do is read a book to stay awake, and it rips my life away but it's a great escape."  i like reading because the character's lives are always more interesting than real life. used book stores are a good way to get cheap stuff. also tag sales|`|AA10552086	Reading gives you something to do. It can make you a better writer and most people believe it helps intelligence.|`|AA11667605	Omigosh. I'm an avid reader-always have been, always will be. Reading helps withcreativity, and it gives you knowledge. Reading can connect you to certain things, or people.  It gives you somethinhg to do.    Used bookstores are always good, if you're in need of pinching pennies, or looking for older books. But stores like BAM and such, which gets new books all the time, are better for people who are always reading.|`|DUwhR7iyaa	i read fact books and do like them. Sometimes books are really boring but for everyone of those there are really good ones out there as well|`|MTl2NDNDaa	Read higher level books makes you learn more words. You get into a book by reading a subject you like or are interested in.|`|8oZEZIfbaa	Reading is very good for you. In some cases it helps you a lot with vocabulary cuz you learn bigger words that you maybe have never heard of. I like it. It's one of my best hobbies. It gives me somethin to do when i'm bored. And a best book for you would be one that best suits you, (gets your attention) and can easily read. Idk about the used store books.|`|XCrtAUTpaa	i recently learned that reading is fun   u just need to find a book that u would be interested in girls usually romance guys well i have no idea   i would suggest the twilight saga   i never read seriously NeVer read then i decided that since all   of the other girls in my school were reading twilight i would try it too.  i started reading it and it was really boring untill the 8th chapter  i ended up reading all four of the books in less than a week  reading can also be a really good escape when u r stressed or just don't have anything else to do|`|FprpWAH1aa	any book is good if its your genre. used book stores should be good cause the external quality is of no importance unless your a germophob. ( phobia of germs- dont like germs )   and they are probably cheaper|`|kNx0AWfXaa	reading makes yo smarter|`|a9OwtN7faa	Because when you read you can   1. expand you vocabulary  2. learn new things   3. find new ways of expression and emotion.    Because when you read it's like daydreaming in someone Else's thoughts. A book can lead you to a place only words can trigger your imagination..    Used book stores are a great place to start. Not only will you find something interesting but you will find it at a great value.    To become interested in a book first think of the one thing that you love the most, crafts medicine, healing, art, comics, vampires...ETC.   whatever it is that you like the most, then find a book on that very topic and I guarantee you that you will find yourself immerse the world of reading!  good luck!|`|DT7yF1roaa	I get into the book by first of all finding a book that looks very interesting.  And yes, used book stores are a good place to go because they have good deals. But they might not have up to date books.

Saints Row is better in storyline play but really suck in graphics and the other stuff.    id rather play GTA IV|`|R7x0qIqyaa	I prefer GTA because it's a lot more realistic than Saint's Row.  Saint's Row has tons of cheat codes, this is probably why people like this game.|`|AA11554181	I love GTA|`|GexnMFKGaa	I personally wouldn't play either one of them.  But GTA has a much bigger following, they've been doing it for longer, and probably better.

It is a mini-game available to free players. Check the exact location using www.runehq.com.|`|EEQ82aM5aa	cant..... master non member....you need to do fist of guthix...which isnt hard...but if your rune crafting ill highly suggest members...makes it go o so much faster.. if you need help my R.S name is igotalvl99....working on 99 thiefing and wc and fletching|`|CoJGCnnYaa	It's a reward from the fist of guthix minigame.
o3yFRnouaa	if you like characters who attack fast you should defenitly be a theif, a assassin as your second job advancement|`|wI9nWWE2aa	It depends on whether or not you're prepared to be a hardcore ms player    If you are just casually playing this, you might want the Mage and the Thief. They level up the fastest early on, but slow down later on (Level 90 or so)    Warriors are the BEST from level 10-15 but gets overtaken by mages and Thief's because of Magic claw and Lucky 7. They get insanely powerful (if you choose the crusader and dragonknight class) at level 70, due to the skill combo and crusher. Dragonknights slow down at level 130 because of lackluster level 4 skills, but Crusaders speed up due to advanced combo.    Bowman absolutely fails at lower/mid levels, and only gets good at level 130, where they max out hurricane. However they are VERY good from level 130-200    Thief's are brilliant from 1st job to 3rd job, but their fourth job skills are not very good, slowing down their kills.    Pirates are kind of average until the 3rd and 4th job for Infighter's and Gunslingers respectively. Infighters get the insane Transformation skill and Gunslingers get a very nice battleship cannon skill      I think I would suggest a Pirate (infighter, or brawler as GMS now calls it) for you. They have the fastest attack  out of all the races.|`|U5KuwJpKaa	Definitely the thief. At higher levels, you can fling shurikens three at a time and extremely fast.
yVAzOBARaa	Nidzilla army eh. might i reccomend substituting one of your scouts sniper rifles for a heavy bolter, the hellfire round was designed to combat tyranids after all, i cant see the loss when it comes tyo having a 2+ poisoned blast weapon to combat the larger enemys.      im assuming that the squad carrying the meltagun will be the squad that will be engaging the foe at close quarters. while the meltagun seems like a sound tactic for that kind of this, are you really wanting to allow the carnifex to engage with foot troops. doing so will rob you of your ability to blast it with the scouts. as such, concentrate as much firepower as you can on the carnifex, and engage the more massed gaunts with the attacking squad. on that note, since they will be attacking a more massed foe, i think a flamer might be a better option if your gonna target the gaunts with them, however i expect your going for the warriors with him, ide leave the carnifex to the guns.      now the last thing im gonna suggest is based entirley on your play style and what models you have. im a big artillery user, so i have a rather large amount of tanks. the greatest thing about tyranids is that they are so flimsy in the morale section. sure you have your synapse creatures (and quite a few of them i see), but thats all that makes them hold.    target the synapse creatures with you scouts and gunline ,blow the hell out of them and break the link to the hive mind. with that severed, replace your dreadnought with a whirlwind and use the pinning effect of the ordanance bombardment to pin them (that cruddy ld with a -1 is a real pain for nid players ive played) after the bombardment, charge the enemy with the captain/ attack squad and butcher them in close combat. if you get the chance, use combat tactics to fall back outy of cambat and then hit them with a barrage again.|`|kNx0AWfXaa	i love that!!!!!! dude thats amazing
AUCcZ8lQaa	The Announcer is the Male voice in the Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, and Halo 3 Multiplayer that shouts out certain phrases when the criteria are met (like the Announcer shouting out Medal names when certain Medals are obtained and general Events in the game).    The Announcer is voiced by Jeff Steitzer|`|9eouWphjaa	BLAH TRIPLE KILL|`|NjZghRpEaa	Lol, I really wish I knew. Every time he says "Double Kill" or something I laugh.
