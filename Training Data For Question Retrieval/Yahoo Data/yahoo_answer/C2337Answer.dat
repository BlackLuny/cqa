GBKaftrJaa	Usually muteness is associated with autism. And there are schools that specialize in autism. A person who is mute is generally given an assisstive communications device to allow them to communicate.  My son simply used a PECS book when he regressed to being mute for a couple of years.    edit: Clearly Miss Behavior deals with shy children and has never seen a child or perhaps an adult who is truly mute, which means they are NOT capable of speech. It can result from an autistic regression, stroke, injury, surgery to the vocal chords or tongue, etc.  And people who are mute are extremely stressed because they can't communicate. It's very stressful for them.    When I had behavioral services for my son (what a joke thoes services are!) the TSS's and BSC's would see my son's home movies and just gasp in horror at the evidence of his muteness shown there.  They would say I should make copies of that so they could show their employers. I said they had no bussiness providing services to autistic kids if they didn't understand what muteness was and Miss Behavior is a prime example of the bigoted people who attempt to be allowed near children who are severely disabled.|`|w9fyt27aaa	I wouldn't know, but I doubt it. I don't think being mute is really a disability.|`|0YhvsxReaa	If there are no mental defects (i.e.--mental retardation) or severe physical abnormalities, children who are "mute" or nonverbal communicators are typically educated in the regular education classroom.  These students are typically treated by a speech-language pathologist, where they can learn anything from sign language to using a computer to aid in communication.|`|ORonhAuvaa	This would be determined by your definition of mutism. Technically, mutes are people who can speak and do not have an underlying language or communication disorder. This is usually thought to be caused by anxiety. We see selective mutes, who are kids who choose not to speak, usually as a means of escaping frustrating or aversive situations.    To answer your question, there are no schools for mutes.

ymVNmC0Xaa	No.Even though it is a longish sentence,the "and " serves as a break between the two ideas.I have noticed however, that American texts often use a comma before an "and" but it certainly is not the case in English punctuation.To put a comma before "in" breaks the sentence in an unnatural way. Read the sentence aloud and you will see you would not pause before "in".|`|lQeYOqmDaa	no u don't
1JeO54hzaa	Spain is a multiparty system (unlike USA) whereby the monarchy is the head of state and the president of government is... well the head of government.    there are two chambers in parliament; congress and senate.  350 members in congress - under a proportional representation system  259 in the senate - not sure about election system for this      that is my limit of knowledge on spain, sorry.
O4oCqaKkaa	Check out the usual page|`|pjEC5qmnaa	First of all, the first problem was done incorrectly by either you or your teacher.  The proper way to solve a slope problem is by using the formula rise/run  or the change in y values/the change in x values.    Therefore, your problem should be:  (2-5)/(4-2)  which equals -3/2  not -2/3    The answer is negative because 2-5=-3.  Think of it this way  if you have 2 stars ** and you want to take away 5 *****, you can take a way 2, and that leaves you with zero, but you still have 3 stars to take away, so you have to take 3 less than   0,  which is 0-3  or  -3.      To find the slope of (-3,5)(2,5) use the same formula    (5-5)/(-3-2) which equals 0/-5.   O divided by any number is 0, so that answer is 0.    (2,-3)(-4,-3)    (-3- -3)/(2- -4)= 0/6  which equals 0.   The top is 0 because if you have a -3 and then take away that -3, even though it is negative, you are subtracting a number from itself and anytime you do that, the answer is 0.    (2,4)(-1,-1)    (4- -1)/(2- -1) equals 5/3.   Thinks about this: When you subtract a negative, you make something more positive by taking away the negative (bad) thing.  Therefore if you have 4 and take away -1, then you are "adding" 1  positive which makes it 5.      I hope this helped you. :)
bDLB2i7Raa	Escalate it, definately escalate it.  If you have an advisor (faculty member or someone in say an advising center) go there.  Otherwise, call the Department Chair's office for Geology, and ask who handles student complaints (could be the Chair him or herself, or there might be a staff person who does it).  The complain.  If you're in one of those ice-bound states, the school should make accomadations.      Be polite.  Don't vent.  Stress you are a hardworking student, you want to do everything you can to maximize your learning (this isn't just worrying about your grade), but you do feel you're being put at a disadvantage by this instructor's inflexibility and for yourself and your fellow students you are asking this higher up person to see if this instructor could be encouraged to allow those of you with real documented power issues to take the make-up quiz.  You do realize you are asking extra work from your instructor, but you are struggling to deal with a difficult situation (no power for a long period) as best you can and would appreciate a helping hand.    I'm one of those who DEAL with student complaints.  What I just wrote would work if *I* got it.  What you don't want to do is be a miserable mean complainer --- to the person you're asking for help, or *about* the instructor.  It always amazes me the number of students who are asking for MY help, who say the meanest things (to and about me).  Maybe we should treat everyone equally, but let me tell you the nice reasonable "please help us" folks get much more of what they want than the "satisfy me, you idiot, or I'll tell your boss".  My boss hates that, you get to my boss the answer is always "no".|`|AA11942204	We do this because it is our job to teach, not research people's excuses for not being in class. What I'd suggest to you is to get some hard documentation. Do you have a letter or e-mail from the electric company saying you can't leave for safety reasons? If you bring your instructor some good hard evidence that you were prevented from attending class plus make a concrete proposal to do additional work in lieu of that missed you might have a serious chance.

fz107eRDaa	The LSAT website actually gives you two free LSATs to download--one is the June 2007 test, and the other is the October 1996 test. But aside from those two, there are no other free LSATs you can download due to copyright issues.    Probably your best deal would be to pick up a copy of The Next 10 Actual, Official LSAT PrepTests. It contains 10 released LSATs, and it costs about $30. There are a couple of other books of 10 tests as well, but those exams are older. Pick them up after you finish with the Next 10.     Good luck!

As long as your teacher isn't smoking in class, I don't see that it's any of your business.    I can fully understand your concern about second-hand smoke...our society has become so obsessed with this matter that they've managed to instill an over-exaggerated fear into our youth.  The FACTS are in the source below...if you are truly concerned, take the time to read this.  I would also encourage you to spread the word with your fellow students as you young ones have been brain-washed since birth by the "do-gooders" in this country and you really should learn to study and rely on yourself for "factual" information.|`|28fd86ae8f5710704b6a01cc48ab5d33aa	If it is tobacco, and he/she is not smoking in school, then it is not a concern of yours. The consequences of smoking are well known. Self-inflicted harm by smoking is quite legal. It's where you smoke that makes it illegal. If it is in class then that is something the principal should know about.    .

I mean it, you've got all weekend to catch up!!! I read it 20 years ago, the first time.I continually read it to answer these questions.    Anytime we get to read about political scandal, we sit up and listen. Julius Caesar is jam packed with all kinds of issues that resonate in big ways with our world today.     Betrayal. Brutus places his ideals (Rome as a republic) over his friend, Julius Caesar, and is willing to kill Caesar to protect the Roman Republic.       Fear. Incredibly afraid of losing Rome as a republic, Brutus is willing to murder Caesar before the guy even does anything wrong. In his mind, it's better to sacrifice an innocent ruler than to risk him becoming a tyrant.       Political Turmoil. Things dont go according to plan. The politicians are like, the citizens are going to kiss our togas for eliminating the tyrant Caesar! Down with absolute power. And then the citizens are like, What! You killed Caesar? We liked him. Lets just say that the politicians arent exactly tuned in to the wants and needs of the citizens.       Passion vs. Reason. With his clear, cool logic, Brutus convinces the concerned public that Caesar was a tyrant, and he needed to be eliminated in order for them to be free. Yet Antony, with his passionate, emotional appeal, just as easily swings the public in the other direction, turning them into an angry mob determined to avenge their beloved Caesar.      Sacrificing Personal Morals for the "Greater Good." Brutus is well-known for being a moral and honest guy, yet he decides to commit murder and sacrifice his morals in hopes of ensuring a better future for Rome.       It seems like the main question is: how can you not care about Julius Caesar?

aiYPHUEWaa	I don't know about Davidson, but most of the liberal arts schools I have looked into seem to pride themselves on having well-funded, "creative" science programs as well.  I think that the quality differs depending on the school.  Why would it matter, though, if you want to go to a liberal arts school badly, whether or not they have a top science program?    And, as far as the PSAT, it's no real indicator of your acceptance chances, since the SAT or ACT scores are used by colleges.  If you add a zero to the PSAT scores, though, it's supposed to "tell" you what your SAT score will be.  I would say 2130/2400 would get accepted with strong grades and a rigorous schedule...|`|AA11604732	Davidson is an excellent school -- and would be a good place to study science.  Liberal Arts colleges do not usually offer business or engineering.  However, science is an important component of a liberal education and is offered by the best liberal arts colleges.    One of the smartest people I've ever met has a math degree from Davidson (he also has degrees from Oxford and Chicago).|`|y8LVlmlJaa	Yes you can. liberal arts means you will do gen eds (general education), as in you will have to take classes across all the disciplines... like you will have to take a few history, english, etc. classes.

(bachelors of science) in [chemistry or biology or physics or whatever you choose].     i'm not sure about PSAT scores... isn't that the pre-SAT? i'm sure they will want your actual SAT scores.    Good luck!|`|AA11942204	Yes you can study science at a liberal arts college. Davidson has majors in biology, chemistry and math.

But .. that being said, those rankings are overrated.  Don't just use them to figure out what school to apply to.  Do you like where Davidson is, are the programs that are biggest/most important for them match what you're interested in.  Look at the website, do you see yourself going to a school like that.

aiYPHUEWaa	Most people naturally assume that the "standard" language used by everyone must be the correct language.  This is definitely not the case, however, as many idoms and phrases used in everyday speech (i.e. "It's me") are technically illogical and incorrect.  Ironically, grammar usually changes to conform to usage in the long run.  So, as far as the "big picture" goes, I suppose "ummmmm" is a reasonable answer...|`|AA11942204	Because "grammar" is a well-understood term. "standardness" is not.

yGOmMQP7aa	I have personally talked to the guy that started this website (an ex Director of a college fin aid office) and his reasoning went something like this....    We help people do something very similar to what tax preparers do.  Sure an individual can do their own taxes for free, but many don't want to... and would rather pay to have it done to make sure it's right.    His logic and reasoning is completely rational... But if it makes it any better, the Dept of Education DID make him put that statement on the top right hand side that says:     "We are not affiliated with the Dept of Education"      Unfortunately, most college students don't know what the heck that means and put in credit card numbers anyway.      Personally I think they should make his website say:    "YOU CAN DO THIS FOR FREE ON http://fafsa.ed.gov "    That would help!!  lol    He also DOES easily issue refunds to those who finally realize they have been scammed.  Just call the Better Business Bureau in your area and they will help you get your money back.  I think that is how he has stayed in business for so many years.

In this case:    P1 =  3 atm  V1 = 1.5 L    P2 = 1 atm  V2 = X    when you solve, X=4.5 L    Depending on whether you teacher rounds up .5, the answer should either be 4 L or 5 L (to have the correct number of sig figs)- but my teachers will still take 4.5 L

N0CrYkv6aa	here's some for you    People who tell small lies are the worst ones. Hence they're compulsive liars.    Fibbing is a Lie in progress..The lie awaits to be let out.    It is double pleasure to deceive the deceiver... Niccolo Machiavelli    The hardest tumble a man can make is to fall over his own bluff. ambrose pearce    "The easiest way to be cheated is to believe yourself to be more cunning than others."Charron, Pierre     "Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools, that don't have brains enough to be honest."Franklin, Benjamin     Life is the art of being well deceived.Hazlitt, William    "The craftiest trickery are too short and ragged a cloak to cover a bad heart."Lavater, Johann Kaspar     He that will cheat at play, will cheat you any way Proverb|`|0E0OaibEaa	The first and worst of all frauds is to cheat one's self. All sin is easy after that. Pearl Bailey     In Hollywood people lie to each other and cheat each other and then go and play tennis. But I don't want to be a tennis player. David Geffen     A guy who'd cheat on his wife would cheat at cards. Texas Guinan     Integrity is not a conditional word. It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will. John D. MacDonald     Golf is like solitaire. When you cheat, you only cheat yourself. Tony Lema     Character is much easier kept than recovered. Thomas Paine    The measure of a man's real character is what he would do if he knew he never would be found out. Thomas Babington Macaulay          Character is higher than intellect. Ralph Waldo Emerson    A cheater cannot tell the truth, not even unto himself.  Unknown    If you have integrity, nothing else matters.  If you don't have integrity, nothing else matters.  Alan Simpson    Integrity is telling myself the truth. And honesty is telling the truth to other people. Spencer Johnson quotes    Integrity is doing the right thing, even if nobody is watching. unknown    I never had to cheat, I get them with what I got. Dave Winfield     Live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity, they think of you. H. Jackson Brown, Jr.    An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it. Mahatma Gandhi     A man told his grandson: "A terrible fight is going on inside me -- a fight between two wolves. One is evil, and represents hate, anger, arrogance, intolerance, and superiority . The other is good, and represents joy, peace, love, tolerance, understanding, humility, kindness, empathy, generosity, and compassion. This same fight is going on inside you, inside every other person too." The grandson then asked: "Which wolf will win?" The old man replied simply: "The one you feed." Anonymous.

Activities for students  - "Green Day" -  not only students can wear anything green on that day, its also a day where everyone becomes environment-friendly in whatever they do eg switch off lights, turn off taps, bring your own water bottle to drink etc etc after which, you can extend it throughout the year.    - Recycling Day - have recycling collection centres in your school. Collect not just bottles and newspapers but things like bottle caps, used envelopes, bread tags, buttons etc which can be used for art projects in school.    - Adopt a park (if your school is near a park) if not, beautify your school with plants, flowers, greeneries to make it more green-friendly and encourage love for nature & green finger.    3. Reach out to the community    1.

pjEC5qmnaa	Your ears pop in air planes because the air high above the surface of Earth is less dense than air near the surface, because air near the surface has all the air above it pushing down.     Some air planes can fly so high they require oxygen masks or a pressurized cabin, so the pilot and passengers dont pass out for lack of air.  Even higher and air planes cant fly because their wings require air to provide lift.     As you ascend in an airplane and the air pressure decreases, the air trapped in your inner ear will cause your eardrums to push outward.  This expansion causes not only the discomfort you feel before your ears "pop," but also a decrease in hearing ability, because the pressure on your ears drums makes the sound harder to transmit.     Your body can equalize the pressure between your inner ear and the atmosphere by allowing some air from your inner ear to escape through the Eustachian tubes, two small channels that connect the inner ears to the throat, one on each side.     When they open, you feel the pressure release and you hear the change because its happening in your ear.  This equalization of pressure is the "pop."     On the way down from an air plane flight, the air pressure increases, while your inner ear is still at the lower pressure it has adjusted to.  Now, the extra pressure pushes the eardrums inward.     Eventually, the pressure will equalize again, but many people dont wait, they just hold their nose closed, close their mouth and blow.  Because the air from their lungs has nowhere to go, it is forced into the inner ear through the Eustachian tubes, "popping" their ears.     This effect can happen to people driving through the mountainous areas or riding elevators in tall buildings, but it is more noticeable on airplanes because the altitude changes quickly and they fly higher than buildings or mountains.|`|fWDVxOkMaa	atmospheric pressure is lower in the air   ur ears rnt used to it and they pop from the change

Dh0JX2Onaa	Here are some suggestions.    1. Have all of your materials ready and in the place that you are going to study.    3. Study when its quiet. No music, no TV, No headphones, no nothing.    4. Do your most difficult subject fist or else you may never get to it.    5. Keep a calendar so that you know when a project is due or a test is going to be given.    6. Vocabulary is very important. Words have different meanings. You need to know the meaning for the subject that you are taking.    7. Study the relationship of things. How is the topic that you studied related to the unit that you are studying?    8. Your textbook has hints for you. Many books have important words or phrases in darkened or colored type, make sure that you know them thoroughly.

BUT in order to stack up your GPA, then the fun ways to study the school stuff are sharing notes with your friends, like sometimes you could test your friends and your friends could also test you, so you get benefited because that you have comunicated with friends and also you get the information that you needed. Also, you could make flash cards of those hard words, to define it, then try to study them. Another thing is you could also go online to find a course that you take in your school and click for games for study, some of the websites will have it but some of them dont. So this is a really fun way to study. Good Luck!

Write in an agenda, I know this is a very annoying practise, but trust me, over time it really does help. If you still have trouble remembering things, try writing on your hand, it also helps not to use a permanent marker when you do this...
O4oCqaKkaa	But Helens life was to change dramatically. In February 1882, when Helen was nineteen months old, she fell ill. To this day the nature of her ailment remains a mystery. The doctors of the time called it brain fever, whilst modern day doctors think it may have been scarlet fever or meningitis.    Whatever the illness, Helen was, for many days, expected to die. When, eventually, the fever subsided, Helens family rejoiced believing their daughter to be well again.    However, Helens mother soon noticed how her daughter was failing to respond when the dinner bell was rang or when she passed her hand in front of her daughters eyes.    It thus became apparent that Helens illness had left her both blind and deaf.    The following few years proved very hard for Helen and her family. Helen became a very difficult child, smashing dishes and lamps and terrorising the whole household with her screaming and temper tantrums. Relatives regarded her as a monster and thought she should be put into an institution.    By the time Helen was six her family had become desperate. Looking after Helen was proving too much for them. Kate Keller had read in Charles Dickens book American Notes of the fantastic work that had been done with another deaf and blind child, Laura Bridgman, and travelled to a specialist doctor in Baltimore for advice. They were given confirmation that Helen would never see or hear again but were told not to give up hope, the doctor believed Helen could be taught and he advised them to visit a local expert on the problems of deaf children. This expert was Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, Bell was now concentrating on what he considered his true vocation, the teaching of deaf children.    Alexander Graham Bell suggested that the Kellers write to Michael Anagnos, director of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, and request that he try and find a teacher for Helen. Michael Anagnos considered Helens case and immediately recommended a former pupil of the institution, that woman was Anne Sullivan.|`|gYA59h41aa	nothing that she knew of

AA11604732	No.    The DVM and MD are both lower degrees than a PhD, and are both higher degrees than a Master's.    A PhD is the highest degree that you can get.  Being higher does not make it better.  It is higher because it is an academic degree -- while the DVM and MD are both considered professional degrees.  For the same reason, an MBA is considered a lower degree than an MS or MA.

On the other hand, we have a teacher in our district who has Asperger's. She is quite pedantic and does not know when to shift gears. For instance, if there is a kid in the class with behavior problems, she will literally obsess on the child, calling in all kinds of help and then not using it.     However, she isn't a bad teacher and has done some very good things. She tends to obsess on small details, but sometimes that's a good thing.

T19HI9mFaa	I teach both English and ESL, and I've never heard that "I am not" could be contracted as "I amn't". The closest contracted form I've come across is "ain't", which isn't really used much anymore in proper English. It is the only contraction of the verb 'to be' that has one form: I'm not. All other forms of 'to be' have two contractions, for example, He's not / He isn't.    Having said that, your prof presents a good argument considering that all other forms of 'to be' in contractions simply add "n't" to the verb to make one of the two contracted forms. Until his "amn't" form gains wide usage and becomes accepted as a word, it will remain a non-word.|`|dL4x119gaa	tell him that am not is ain't    i am not going over there.    i ain't going over there.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	It isn't.

ejodXS5naa	You need to do things that show you are passionate about math and science.  What exactly that means depends.  But let me give you some examples.    Take all the math or science classes you school has to offer and then take even more classes at the local university (a community college is alright, but the better the college, the more this will help).  Also, I know there are some elective science and math classes offered at some high schools that don't really fall into the typical curriculum progression (genetics, math for future cashiers, etc).  You can take these classes if you are interested in them, but they will not help as much as the core classes.    Get involved in math/science competitions.  I don't really mean math bowl.  Everyone at Caltech does math bowl.  But there are some more prestigious competitions that will help set you apart from other applicants, especially if you do well.  If you are good at math, look into the AIME.    Do something productive over the summers.  There are some great math and science camps out there.  Go to one.  Again, if math is your thing, the top math camps are at Ohio State (I think) and Boston University (I think).  Also MIT and Caltech have summer programs.  So does Harvard and Stanford, but a summer program where you do research (MIT and Caltech) is better then a summer school.    Get involved in research.  Look at the websites for the science, math, and engineering departments at your local university and see if there are some professors who look like they are doing cool research.  Then contact them and see if they will let you work for them.  You can also contact the department chair or someone else in the office and ask them if they have any suggestions on professors who would be willing to take on a high school student.  Research is a big big big golden star on your application, especially if you can get published.    Other than that, do all the basic stuff.  Keep up with your extracurricular activities (especially the ones you enjoy).  Get good grades by taking the hardest classes available to you and acing them.  Do well on your SAT's.  Find teachers that like you and will write a great recommendation.  And write a killer essay.  To get into Caltech, you have to have a great application and be strong in every aspect.  But it is possible.      Oh, and the community service thing is a bit over-rated in my opinion.  I doubt it is as important as you think it is.  And it is certainly not a golden ticket to Caltech.

But if you realize that you don't have to accomplish a great deal in an unreasonably short period of time, and you simply begin from where you're at, very simply, the next steps will come little, by little, until you have completed your task.

It's probably great for the homeschooling mindset because you can skip around without completing one lesson if you feel you're up to it.  Unfortunately, it's really hard to describe what the program is like--it's best to experience it for yourself...you can download the trial version of their Spanish language program here: http://www.download.com/Rosetta-Stone-Sp...    I did enjoy pairing this program with the Pimsleur audio tapes for the Spanish I was trying to learn...combining the two forms seemed to solidify the concepts I was learning in the other one...especially the way the words were actually written, even though the Pimsleur folks expressly say that focusing on the written words is verboten.  I'm sure most folks will find that avenue totally out of their price range, though.    Incidentally, I got to review the Auralog system, too...it's ok...a bit more of what a traditional software title should be like, grading you on pronunciation and the like. Transparent Language had an interesting approach as well, but I'm unsure if there is a Japanese language component.  I think if you really want to learn a language, of course, there's nothing like total immersion.  Learn enough to ask the basics and just go and hang out for six months in Japan...again, not for everybody, though.|`|DiSOdCFXaa	yes because i learn a lot of stuff from rosetta stone more than i do about regular school. that's kinda crazy actually!
AA11604732	None of the schools in the CSU system are very selective or very good.  While they provide a reasonable education for the price for California residents, paying out-of-state rates to go to one would be crazy.  If you want a bad public university, you can find a much cheaper one in Kansas.    And Fresno is in the Central Valley?  Have you ever been there?  It is in the middle of nowhere -- three hours from LA and three hours from SF and three hours from the ocean in general.    If you want to go to school in California, go to a private university or a school in the UC system (University of California schools are all high quality).  If you really do want to be in the Central Valley -- try UC-Merced.

P77aCOvAaa	Some students prefer to attend a community college for their first one or two years because the tuition is cheaper. However, most community colleges don't have dorms, so you will either have to live at home or find an apartment.    After attending a community college, you can transfer your class credits to a bachelor-degree granting school. You will then have to attend that school two or three years, depending on how many credits the school accepts.    Overall, if you're concerned about the price of tuition, a community college is a good option. If you want the "full college experience" of living in the dorms, participating in student activities, etc, then attend a 4-year college or university.

pjEC5qmnaa	Yes it would help.  To get into any good college (I'm going through the process right now!!)  you need to have a well rounded resume.  Colleges want several things    High SAT/ACT scores  High GPA  Difficult/full course load  Clubs/sports, it is best to have a few you're really dedicated to instead of having lots you know nothing about  Community Service  is extremely important and colleges love to see that you help your community so do as much as possible.    To a lesser extent:    Traveling Abroad  Job Experience  High Literacy Level  Financial Need|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	not unless the kids are poor|`|zGtELDrnaa	Nittany Lions!! Lets. Go. P.S.U.!!!|`|sGQprLf8aa	As a current Penn State student, take this to heart:    Penn State loves volunteer work and extra-curricular activities, HOWEVER, grades, GPA, and SAT scores are the items weighed most when they select their students. And even though Penn State claims grades and test scores aren't everything, if you want to get into the University Park campus your first two years- they are! Anyone can get into a branch campus and go to Main starting their Junior year, but the ones who score high on the SAT and have about a 3.4 GPA in high school or better, are usually the ones that get into the main campus their first year. Apply early (by the end of September of your senior year in high school)! You have better chances. If you dont have the scores or the grades apply anyways! Because sometimes they will still pick someone with lower scores and grades (but for main campus this is unusual because of the high amount of people that apply every year.)    p.s. start saving now!!! (especially if you dont live in PA).  Penn State is one of the MOST expensive public university in the country! I will be paying back my loans for the rest of my life...and my kids will probably be paying them back too...  To the class of 2009! :)

Kansas does not mean People of the South Wind.  That would be Kanza.  Kansas lacks a meaning because it was a whiteman's mis-spelling of an Indian tribal name.    If you want an explicit definition of what Kansas means, ask any Okie, Coloraidian, Missourian, or Nebraskan.    For me, a lifelong resident of the Sunflower State, Kansas means honest hardworking people with a heart who reside in the midwest United States.
kLXgrjISaa	I remember sophomore and junior GPA was most looked upon.  Since you dont complete your senior year, they can only look at maybe your first semester grades from that year.    Keep in mind, to get into a UC, its not just GPA, its your personal statement, SAT scores, and whether or not you have additional extra curriculars.  Theres always ways to boost the chance of getting in.    Another thing i want to mention, is that the amount of people colleges are accepting in california is a bit lower because of the current state of the economy.  So it might be a lot more competitive, but also it might be better when the time comes for you to apply.

dteai1OOaa	If you have a cellphone,text in class!  Make sure to hide it behind a book,or in your jacket,so the teacher won't see you. I know this isn't what you wanted,but passing notes really can make time go faster! But make sure that you don't do it in markers while doing classwork,because the teacher would get suspicious,and come over and take it. (Trust me,this happened to one of my best friends just the other day!)  Also draw,and bring a coloring book to keep yourself occupied when you finish your work. So if your teachers ask,tell them that you finished all the work.  Also,if you're allowed,listen to your ipod or something to stay focused. Or you could read a really good book!  Take your time,have fun! And good luck! =)|`|BJERgbM5aa	If you don't do the class work (which makes time pass easier), then eventually you will be trying to pass 'dead time' in the deans office.|`|0d377d0d2a45168d89fa1c2edc51f4e0aa	Nothing makes the time go faster than reading...|`|Sn4ldoifaa	one word:doodle draw whatever you like..i do that sometimes when i bored:)|`|yaJ2481maa	Bring puzzles like Sudoku or word finds or something of the sort.

fOAcibLeaa	YES. just do it man lol. don't let others discourage you just because they may have got higher than u.i got 2A*'s 8A's and 1C a few people got higher than me but that's not going to stop me lol. just make sure you do well in your AS levels which is what i intend to do and you'll be fine lol. universities are actually looking less and less at GCSE's. if you get AAAA at a level they're more likely to accept you over some who acheived 10 A*'s and got BBBB at AS. Just do it and see what happens....|`|JJ8HQTtwaa	If you can get AAA then you always have a chance, it will show them that you are an improving student and that you will work hard.     However, you need to have alot of extra cirricular activities to get in. There are around 20 applicants per place so it is very competitive.     Relavant work experience e.g. Hospital, volunteering work, mentoring or something at your school, musical instrument, sports etc etc.     This is the sort of thing which will put you above other candidates as it shows your commitment|`|JX2Kmgr1aa	Yes. Probably, but they take into account how good your school was. If you did much better than your school average you have a much better chance.

First, check and see if they allow or request interviews. That will give you the opportunity to explain to them that they are your first choice and a lot of the time character and personality factor into a college's acceptances. You can also address your grades in your essay if they require one. Don't make excuses, but you could offer an explanation of why your grades aren't all A's...such as the fact that you're taking extremely hard classes. Another thing you could do is schedule a tour. While you're on the tour, make a point to track down an admissions counselor. Talk to them and get their names too. Then when you get home, email them thanking them for the time they took to talk to you. I did this with a school I applied to and got accepted the week after i applied. Good luck! I hope you get in =) and good choice of major... it's my major too!

d36da7bbff05d23acceb010110cea63eaa	Congratulations on having one of the most well-written and articulate questions I've ever seen here. Since you clearly have some background in literature and maybe plays, you'll understand the term "the fourth wall". Every play has a wall behind it and on either side, but the fourth wall is in front of the audience, allowing them to distance themselves from the action on stage and allowing the play to be performed without acknowledging the audience. Wilder wanted to tear the fourth wall down forcing the audience (in which he planted actors) and the actors on stage to interact. By removing the fourth wall, Wilder hoped to bring a freshness to each performance that is usually impossible to maintain. Finally, Wilder was deathly tired of standard American play-writing. He longed to be as iconoclastic as Pirandello, but until "Skin of Our Teeth" was still bound by ordinary theater conventions.

There's very little that you can do in the psychology field with just an undergraduate degree.  You should be able to take some of your undergrad courses at a community college, but you'll need a four-year degree from a regular university to go on to grad school.

bf83119e024ab64c983c6074c0bb966caa	Your EFC is your estimated family contribution, ie- what they expect you to pay out-of-pocket to go to school. How much money FAFSA gives you (in the form of grants, which you do not need to pay back, or the form of federally subsidized loans, which you must pay back after graduation with a small amount of interest) depends on a lot of things. What state you attend school in, how much money FAFSA has to offer, how much money your school has to give in aid or scholarships, how much money your state has to give in grants, how much it costs to go to your school, and how much you (and your parents if you are under the age of 23 and unmarried/without children) make per year. There isn't a very good way to estimate how much financial aid you will receive, however, know that FAFSA expects you will have to pay 3500 out of your own pocket to go to school.    Hope that helps, and best of luck in school.

If you do not have a current IEP but are in high school then you can have your parent make a parent referral to the EC department at your school IN WRITING AND DATED. The school will then have 90 days to test you and determine your special education eligibility. If you are found eligible you may then go through the process to utilize accommodations on your SAT.    If you are no longer in high school then you will have to resort to private testing to verify your disability and based on results you will have to complete the necessary paperwork to utilize accommodations on the SAT.    Good luck to you!

RUf73hG1aa	First of all, do not act on any feeling you might have.  You can get him in A LOT of trouble for having a relationship with a student.  You might be a favorite student of his (I am a teacher and I have several students who I can talk to and joke around with more than others).  I talk to my favorite students more than the students who don't seem to want to get to know me or talk to me.      If you said you forget about him when he's not your teacher, then there is nothing going on.  You just enjoy being in his class.  He will probably be one of the teachers you will remember forever, but please do not act on any feelings.  If you are wrong about him and he does not like you, then things become really awkward for you at school when you are in his class.  If he does like you, then he is setting himself up to be fired and to never teach again if he gets caught.  If he really is a good teacher, do not give him that problem.  Good Luck.|`|9g734Pjaaa	Is this teacher making you uncomfortable? I know it's hard to have a crush on a teacher, or any adult, really, but it is still inappropriate for a teacher and student to have any kind of sexual relationship (whether it is simply holding hands and looking into each other's eyes or more than that). Can you discuss this with a parent, an older cousin, a counselor (perhaps a school counselor, although I can imagine why that idea might make you uncomfortable), or a trusted adult friend -- such as the parent of a classmate? I imagine that your feelings for this teacher will eventually loosen, lessening the heat of the crush. It is hard, though, and I could be wrong -- maybe your feelings won't pass. But either way, you would be well advised to tell someone how you are feeling and, if your gut tells you this man really is interested in you, get help from an adult to put a stop to it. Sometimes this takes courage -- i.e., if you have to take it to the principal, you might feel nervous. But your safety needs to come before anything else. It is better to be safe than sorry (or, as I word it, it is SAFER to be safe than sorry).|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	"and when he does attendance he always just says my name to himself loudly and automatically says "shes here".

I say consider community college.|`|NaI2wAHzaa	When you sign up for the SAT and ACT, I remember that there was a spot to check if you wanted the test organization to forward information to schools which they think would be interested in you, even if you aren't interested in them or even heard of them.  I got mailboxes full of stuff from all sorts of Division III and NAIA schools all over the country that I had never heard of before.  Instead of flyers in the snail mail, today you probably get email information left and right.    There are plenty of schools out there that want to increase enrollment, whether to combat a recent drop in students or a desire to add additional programs.  One of my alma maters, a big ten school, is receiving record applications.  The other, a missouri valley school, is battling a slow erosion of enrollment.  They are actively recruiting students there.
lbQkV9QKaa	Well i don't know how to find the answer your way, but I understand what you mean, I don't think your suppose to use completing the square for this problem though. Here is how I would solve it.    4x^2+4x = 3 (Since it is quadratic, move everything to one side and set it equal to 0)  4x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0 ( now factor)  [(4x +6) (4x - 2)] / 4 = 0  [ 2( 2x + 3) 2 ( 2x - 1)} / 4 = 0 ( divide out)   ( 2x + 3) ( 2x - 1) = 0 (now to make the whole equation equal to zero we have to set each binomial to 0  2x + 3 = 0  2x = -3  x = - 1 1/2 ( -1.5)    2x -1 = 0  2x = 1  x = 1/2 ( 0.5)    So x equals both -1 1/2 and 1/2|`|yko1tx4jaa	subtract 3 from each side. use the quadratic formula.    should get .5 and -1.5|`|cIDY7lYuaa	If you need to solve it by completing the square, do this:    4x^2 + 4x = 3  x^2 + x = 3/4  x^2 + x + (1/2)^2 = 3/4 + (1/2)^2  (x+1/2)^2 = 3/4 + 1/4  (x+1/2)^2 = 1  x = 1/2 or -3/2    Hope this helped, and by the way, I think you just had a calculation error or forgot to add (1/2)^2 on both sides.

c231bbpTaa	I just graduated from College last may, so no I'm not a parent, but I'm familiar with paying for it.<br>  <br>  First of all you should have her ask her school about any scholarships that she can apply for. Have her apply for all that she can qualify for. <br>  <br>  She will probably have to apply for some loans as well. Things you want to check with loans is if they are privatized or not. If they come from a private company it's really hard to find someone to consolidate them. I couldn't find anyone who would consolidate my private loans. Federal loans can be consolidated. Also interest is something to look at. How much is it? Is it a fixed rate or not? And another thing is how long after she graduates will she have to start paying them back? I've found that most are around 6 months. <br>  <br>  As for who takes out the loan, it will probably be either you or you will have to be a cosigner. Because most kids don't have credit history when going into college, companies don't want to take the risk of them no paying. This happened with my private loans. I got a couple of Stafford loans through the government that I signed alone without my parents. But with my private loans, if I pay everything on time for about 4 or 5 years the parents can be taken off the loan.<br>  <br>  Also you might want to see if your state or the state of the college your daughter is going to have a student loan organization. In Vermont we have the Vermont Student Assistant Corporation (VSAC) that I did my private loans through. They have many choices though and help you out with getting loans for college. Though since we are in a tough economical crisis it might be hard for her to find a loan.|`|k96aZXY2aa	I am just about to graduate from college.

AA10333093	"Personification" would be the word if the qualities in question were human.

But it is giving HUMAN qualities, not animal qualities, to inanimate things. It means treating something as if it were capable of the same things as a PERSON is (emotions, heart-beat, intelligence, etc). Of course, you could argue that animals have emotions, heart-beat, intelligence, etc. too but that is a weak argument, really, until all people treat all animals with the same exact respect as they treat human beings.
3lEMNFFzaa	I have no idea what 'Ask Shirley' is, but I am assuming it is an advise colum, like Dear Abby or Ann Landers?   It's a rather personal assignment... most people write anonymously asking questions about relationships or what not.  Google around a bit searching for old  'Dear Abby' colums, or old 'Ann Landers' ones.  Then read thru a few, choose a few crazy ones, and combine them, changing the names.  I'd make it funny and goofy.... have fun with it.  For example, have it be someone who is writting concerned with horrific body odor.  They have no freinds, the dog won;t even come near them, they shower 4 times a day and nothing helps the stench, the neighbors even moved away because they complained it was like living next door to the local landfill (they in fact moved next door to the landfill, and have called to tell them it is such a wonderful change to breathe the fresh air!), etc.  Just be outrageous with it....lol|`|TxecTL1aaa	i would say maybe something like are you dating and who and why that is all i got and aren't they suppose to ask the question|`|5oAU7S9zaa	Right about problems in your life and in your friends lives, and then write about how you think you could solve them.|`|YxLw8Aa0aa	Ask some advice on what you need help with.

QBFANhXaaa	Grade inflation is where the average grade for any given class at a college is above a C. A C is technically supposed to be an average, but if all the students get B's it's not fair because they can't all be exceptional. It basically means the grade averages are boosted so that a B is the new C. What does it mean for students? It gives them a false sense of accomplishment. A C grade tells them where they stand (average) but if they get all B's and A's ...well it's like the saying, You're special just like everyone else.
lQIKWXDuaa	Dont take time off. Get school over with. Enroll at a  community college to start, trade school of a four year university.

lEmKvS50aa	I believe that college is a necessity.  It's the best way to advance your career opportunities.  College provides a vast wealth of knowledge.  By attending, you will become more responsible and learn to be independent.  You will mature in ways you never thought possible.  However, college has become more and more expensive.  Yes, there are grants, loans and scholarships but sometimes these options just aren't enough.  I firmly believe tuition is the key issue and it should be lowered.  When you are able to conquer the financial side of college it pays off in the end.  It may take a while to feel as if you are accomplishing anything because there are so many classes unrelated to your major but staying focused is the key.  College is very challenging and demanding.

ZWzcrdn0aa	From the official GRE FAQ webpage, www.ets.org:    When are scores reported?    If you take the computer-based General Test, you can view your unofficial Verbal and Quantitative scores at the test center; however, because of the essay scoring process, you will not be able to view your Analytical Writing scores at that time. Verbal, Quantitative and Analytical Writing scores on the computer-based General Test will be sent to you and the institutions you designate within 10 to 15 days of your test administration.    If you take the paper-based General Test, you will not view any scores at the test center.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I skipped my every  graduation since High School, and I would have skipped that if I could have. To be honest, I sort of regret that I did because it was very anti-climatic just getting my diploma in the mail. You need to do something, but I would advise not spending a lot of money on it.<br>  <br>  The reason I skipped my college (and later law school) graduations was  that I had been forced to attend my sisters college graduation when I was a kid.  Sis went to the University of New Mexico, a big state school. (It has something like 18,000 undergrads now. It was smaller back then, but even so it was pretty big.)<br>  <br>  Now they break graduation up into different colleges (If they didn't it would take forever. Do the math on handing out 3,000 diplomas. Even if you can do 4 a minute, that's still a LONG time). Even so,  there were still a LOT of people getting diplomas, they did the ceremony in the basketball arena. She didn't know most of them, (I didn't know ANY of them, I was 8 or so) and we all sat there, through  all the speeches, and then through them calling out all the hundreds of names, with everyone walking up, getting the diploma, and walking off.  I remember it as the most boring experience of my life...and there is some pretty stiff competition for that title.<br>  <br>  So it depends on the size of your school.  If you have a small school you might want to do it. You will know most of the people and it won't take to long. If you go to a big state school, I'd advise skipping  the graduation part.<br>  <br>  I think you are wise to go to the convocation only.  You need to do something ( it felt very empty just getting the diploma in the mail). Perhaps a big party at home with your family and friends would be an option. Still spending several hours sitting through several hundred strangers getting diplomas left me with a distaste for graduation ceremonies that stayed with me for the rest of my life.

f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	It's a disease, usually affects the lungs but can affect other body parts. It's been pretty well wiped out but it's ugly head  around once again.<br>  <br>  Dictionary definition of a turbercle:<br>  <br>  A nodule or swelling, especially a mass of lymphocytes and epithelioid cells forming the characteristic lesion of tuberculosis.<br>  <br>  And is is an INFECTIOUS disease too.|`|Wpulf29Maa	Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus or Tuberculosis) is a common and often deadly infectious disease caused by mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1]. Tuberculosis usually attacks the lungs (as pulmonary TB) but can also affect the central nervous system, the lymphatic system, the circulatory system, the genitourinary system, the gastrointestinal system, bones, joints, and even the skin. Other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canetti, and Mycobacterium microti also cause tuberculosis, but these species are less common.<br>  <br>  The classic symptoms of tuberculosis are a chronic cough with blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Infection of other organs causes a wide range of symptoms. The diagnosis relies on radiology (commonly chest X-rays), a tuberculin skin test, blood tests, as well as microscopic examination and microbiological culture of bodily fluids. Tuberculosis treatment is difficult and requires long courses of multiple antibiotics. Contacts are also screened and treated if necessary. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem in (extensively) multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Prevention relies on screening programs and vaccination, usually with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG vaccine).<br>  <br>  Tuberculosis is spread through the air, when people who have the disease cough, sneeze, or spit. One third of the world's current population has been infected with M. tuberculosis, and new infections occur at a rate of one per second.[2] However, most of these cases will not develop the full-blown disease; asymptomatic, latent infection is most common. About one in ten of these latent infections will eventually progress to active disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than half of its victims. In 2004, mortality and morbidity statistics included 14.6 million chronic active cases, 8.9 million new cases, and 1.6 million deaths, mostly in developing countries.[2] In addition, a rising number of people in the developed world are contracting tuberculosis because their immune systems are compromised by immunosuppressive drugs, substance abuse, or AIDS. The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe with about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries testing positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5-10% of the US population test positive.[1] It is estimated that the US has 25,000 new cases of tuberculosis each year, 40% of which occur in immigrants from countries where tuberculosis is endemic.[1]<br>  Treatment for TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are rifampicin and isoniazid. However, instead of the short course of antibiotics typically used to cure other bacterial infections, TB requires much longer periods of treatment (around 6 to 12 months) to entirely eliminate mycobacteria from the body.[8] Latent TB treatment usually uses a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics, to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.[42] People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. However, treatment using Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide is not risk-free. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notified healthcare professionals of revised recommendations against the use of rifampin plus pyrazinamide for treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, due to high rates of hospitalization and death from liver injury associated with the combined use of these drugs.[43]<br>  <br>  Drug resistant tuberculosis is transmitted in the same way as regular TB. Primary resistance occurs in persons who are infected with a resistant strain of TB. A patient with fully-susceptible TB develops secondary resistance (acquired resistance) during TB therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately, or using low quality medication.[42] D

gbCB0ohJaa	I bet you're thinking of a listing after a person's name, like this.    Random O. Professor, University of Toronto, Ph.D.  J. Typical Lawyer, Yale University, J.D.   Yetta Nother Graduate, University of Sussex, A.B.    The letters are the abbreviations of degrees.  Ph.D. means an earned doctorate that isn't a doctor of medicine or dentistry or veterinary or something like that.  It stands for doctor of philosophy in English, and philosophia doctor in Latin.    J.D. is the usual abbreviation for a law degree in the USA, juris doctor.  Traditionally in Canada and other common-law countries, a lawyer's first degree is the LL. B, bachelor of laws, although some universities are changing to call their degrees JD.      A.B., or B.A. at some universities, is a first degree in arts, artium baccalaureus or a bachelor of arts degree.

I called my advisor/salesperson and told her I wanted to withdraw. She then transfered me to the assistant dean of the center. She processed my withdrawl request, but not before trying to keep me in. She sent me a letter of intent and I had to reply saying I wanted to withdraw.     They then send that to the admisions center, and the request is processed. Even though you have withdrawn, they will continue sending junk mail. Make sure you request that it is put to a stop. I did that, but they continue sending it, so I will have to request again. Good luck.

UspK4SQBaa	There are a few schools that will accept you with experience in the field.  They are few and far between.  A lot of these programs will only award the degree on the condition that you complete your bachelor's first.  What you can do is speak to an adviser at your community college, to help you through the application process, help you choose schools, and decide on an accelerated learning or online program to earn your bachelor's while earning your master's.|`|tJoeIalKaa	nope!|`|mGubEYTRaa	I'm pretty sure you will need to get your bachelor's degree first.

What you COULD do is contact Western Governors University, Charter Oaks State College or Exelsior (college? uni?). There may be ways for you to earn credits towards the bachelors based on competency.    All are appropriately accredited.|`|FK9GZblCaa	nope.  You have to get the bachelor's degree.

wbO7iyHMaa	What do you mean by locating CLEP tests?  They have to be taken at a college that administers CLEP tests in their testing center.  You can find your locate CLEP testing center on the College Board website:    http://apps.collegeboard.com/cbsearch_cl...    That same website will also provide you with detailed information as to what CLEP tests are, what test subjects are available, and information on how to prepare for the test.  There is also a search available to find out what colleges grant CLEP credit.      However, make certain that you check directly with the college you're interested in attending.  Each college's CLEP acceptance policy is different.  Not all schools grant credit for all CLEP tests, some will only allow you to earn so many credits through CLEP, etc.  It's very important that you contact the college BEFORE taking any CLEP tests to determine what their specific policy is.  Otherwise, you run the risk of wasting time & money studying and testing for something that they may not grant credit for.
8078b060eeeeedad269ae982e11dfc38aa	It is a love poem.  He is giving himself and everything that is him to his love.  He is promising her everything that she might ever desire.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	I'd say it's about his intention to make love to her, and that she's a virgin (a 'maid'). But that he realises that in doing that, he's giving her as much as he's taking. It's a grown up poem about mating, about the way that each gives, and each takes, and there is pleasure and satisfaction in both the giving and the taking. It's physical and sensual and aware that sensuality can be both sweet and sour. I would say it is an epithalamion, a poem for the bridal chamber, as if written by the husband / groom, in this instance (traditionally they are often written by a friend of one of the wedding couple). Some parts are more obscure than others, the five pips for instance ... at a guess, five children ... to look after her in her old age? I'm afraid I don't know enough about Louise Bogan's life, or when this was written, to know how closely this might relate to events in her life, or a loved one's, but it may be purely an invented, idealised scene ... and that would be my guess.

AA10276327	The black veil is a symbol of secret sin. This could be representative of the secret sin that all men carry in their hearts, or it could be representative of Mr. Hooper's specific sin, adultery. Edgar Allan Poe speculated that Minister Hooper may have had an affair with the young lady who died at the beginning of the story, as this is the first day he wears the veil, "and that a crime of dark dye, (having reference to the young lady) has been committed, is a point which only minds congenial with that of the author will perceive." Also, he is unable to tell his fiance why he wears the veil due to a vow he has made, and is unwilling to show his face to the young lady even in death. Also, two funeral attendees see a vision of him walking hand in hand with the girl's spirit.

Don't push yourself too far if it will risk your health.    I would say you can do it if you know how to study, ie. pick out the key points that will help you answer questions and revise in a helpful way.  You will need to sit down and look at what is required in terms of coursework and exam questions, what are the texts in question etc, and work out for yourself if you can do it.  Allocate time for each topic on paper and see if it is realistic.  If you do go ahead, it will be helpful to convince your teacher you are putting in the work and are determined to try, and that you would like her/his support to do the best you can.  Alternatively consider just taking some exams and delaying others - you are young at this point to do them.|`|BEmhEDcGaa	If you want to, you are going to need motivation.

Lewis Black explained the issue in Red, White, & Screwed MUCH BETTER then I ever could...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWqtpqQjN...    There is still the nonsense about school funding... In Chicago, inner city schools get $11,000 a head while in the "rich" outer areas around the city they get $17,000 a head...    Their arguments are negated by the fact that outside of Chicago, in towns in the rest of Illinois, they are getting by with $9,000 or LESS and yet they still have a 96% graduation rate with a majority of graduates going on to secondary education of one form or another.    If kids in a 'po-dunk' town can get by on $9,000 and still have a good education... Do you think it might be the PEOPLE in the inner city schools that are the problem and not the funds?

With the current state of the economy, I suggest that you stay in school the extra year and see if somehow you can land a nice internship along the way.

WJ4e4NYzaa	I'm assuming how often does February 1 land on a Sunday and have 28 days in it ( 4 weeks exactly ).    The last time this happened was 2004. It doesn't happen every "so many years". If it's leap year obviously there cannot be a perfect 28 day month even if the first day is a Sunday.     Non- leap years push the dates one day ahead the following year. For example, if Jan 31 1 fell on a Friday this year, next year it would fall on a Saturday (perfect Feb 1 on a Sunday!). If this were to happen on a leap year however, next year Jan 31 would fall on a Sunday causing the perfect Feb not to happen.    So, a perfect 28 day February beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday (exactly four perfect weeks) happens every six years until Jan 31 falls on a Saturday on a leap year; then we wait 5 more years.    There is either 6 or 11 years between. There is a random pattern of   6's and 11's. The long stretch is caused by Jan 31 falling on a Saturday in a leap year sending Feb 1 to start on Monday the next year as opposed to a Sunday if it were a non-leap year. So then we had to wait for the cycle to run through all days of  the week again and until Jan 31 fell on a Saturday in a non-leap year.    Perfect February's since 1970, next was 81, 87, 98, 09. Next one is due in 2015.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	every forth year there is a leap year so three years|`|KYaM65gzaa	3 times in every four years. there are 28 days in feb once but once every four years the leap year there are 29.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Three years out of four.    In the fourth year (Leap Year) there are 29 days rather than the more usual 28 for a perfect four weeks.  To be absolutely perfect it would need to have Monday for Feb 1st as Sunday is the last day of the week!|`|lbQkV9QKaa	well the chance that the first lands on a sunday is 1/7. The chance that we have 28 days and not 29 days is 3/4.   So 3/4 x 1/7 is 3/28.  So, approximately in every 28 years, it happens 3 times.|`|zmPifLEhaa	since the year 0000, this has happened 221 times.  I wrote a computer program to determine this.  The criteria is:    1) the year cannot be a leap year  2) Feb 1 is on a Sunday  3) Feb 28 is on a Saturday.    It happened on the following years:    9  15  26  37  43  54  65  71  82  93  99  105  111  122  133  139  150  161  167  178  189  195  201  207  218  229  235  246  257  263  274  285  291  303  314  325  331  342  353  359  370  381  387  398  409  415  426  437  443  454  465  471  482  493  499  505  511  522  533  539  550  561  567  578  589  595  601  607  618  629  635  646  657  663  674  685  691  703  714  725  731  742  753  759  770  781  787  798  809  815  826  837  843  854  865  871  882  893  899  905  911  922  933  939  950  961  967  978  989  995  1001  1007  1018  1029  1035  1046  1057  1063  1074  1085  1091  1103  1114  1125  1131  1142  1153  1159  1170  1181  1187  1198  1209  1215  1226  1237  1243  1254  1265  1271  1282  1293  1299  1305  1311  1322  1333  1339  1350  1361  1367  1378  1389  1395  1401  1407  1418  1429  1435  1446  1457  1463  1474  1485  1491  1503  1514  1525  1531  1542  1553  1559  1570  1581  1587  1598  1609  1615  1626  1637  1643  1654  1665  1671  1682  1693  1699  1705  1711  1722  1733  1739  1750  1761  1767  1778  1789  1795  1801  1807  1818  1829  1835  1846  1857  1863  1874  1885  1891  1903  1914  1925  1931  1942  1953  1959  1970  1981  1987  1998  2009|`|buJCtC54aa	every 7 years? not sure but then a leap years once every 4 so maybe every 28 years

A "trained seal" wouldn't be able to play a violin, and in your sentence the writer is saying he believed the child would not be able to play the violin with any kind of skill at all.<br>  <br>  2. I think you mean "PREformed vitamin A," retinol. Preformed ("already formed") means it is the pure vitamin alone, rather than that which is found in food (like carotene in carrots), which must be converted to vitamin A (retinol) by the body.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Performed vitamin A means you can use it right after eating it.  Some things like carbs, they say eat the day before for energy the FOLLOWING day, and perhaps other vitamins need to be "processed" before they get into the bloodstream and to your organs etc.  So these get to work right away.<br>  <br>  As for what number 1 means, I think it's refering to playing without emotion or feeling. A trained seal just copies what it sees.  So I'm assuming the girl wasn't very GOOD!!

As for the questions you could think about this: 1) Did the Oompa Loompas willingly agree to work for Wonka, knowing the tasks that they had to do? 2) Do the Oompas seem to look mistreated? 3) What are the Oompas getting out of working for Wonka?|`|gun0Pt8jaa	If you're wanting questions on how Willy Wonka is treating the Oompa Loompas like slaves, you could go with; They don't get health benefits, they don't get paid for their services, no vacation time, did they even want to go with Mr. Wonka after they were discovered? Were they kidnapped or held against or tricked into leaving their native land? Threats into doing what they are told, maybe you can branch off more from that<br>  I hope that helps little, its been awhile. Good Luck!
bPC0xo6Jaa	you should not consider about how much will you pay. it's a matter of passion and enthusiasm. if you are determined enough of being a teacher, you will not consider what for example are the benefits you will get. what matters most is what and how you impart knowledge to your learners. the impact you have on them is the best. <br>  <br>  actually, teaching in the early times do not have pay. it's pure service. for teaching is not just mere profession. it's a vocation and a mission.<br>  <br>  so go for being a teacher then.<br>  <br>  teachers are like candles, they consume themselves to light the way for others... unknown|`|TanAU2aAaa	You shouldnt think about the pay for work bc if you really love your job you never work a day in your life. the average pay for teachers differs slightly by whether the school is<br>  public or private<br>  first or secondary<br>  high school or college<br>  what subject<br>  how many periods you teach.<br>  what state ( if in the US)<br>  In my school you dont get paid extra to coach a sport but in the catholic school you do.<br>  the average pay for a high school teacher is $52,113. middle school is 48,754 with 19 years or under of experience.

Make sure you really want to become a teacher before deciding on that career path - it's a tough job and I've seen many teachers burn out quickly because they weren't 100% sure they really wanted to teach. Teaching is incredibly rewarding, but incredibly frustrating at times, too! I don't want to discourage you, of course! :) If you really love teaching, you'll make it work even when the pay might not be as much as somewhere else. :D|`|4IKvranzaa	I would suggest going to a local school district and ask if you can look around.  They will normally allow you to observe classes and ask all kinds of questions.  In my school district, any teachers can coach at any grade level but normally coaches coach where they teach.  Most school districts have their salaries posted on their websites so you can look around.  With school budgets being cut, jobs are going to be tough to find this year...so hurry and get your foot in the door!

D4XWrwuaaa	I would just call it out directly so there is no question.<br>  <br>  If your time at a place was short, do not leave it for the future employer to guess why. Most of them will assume you either job hopped because you were there a short time, or you were let go because you did not work out.<br>  <br>  If you explicitly say you were let go because of layoffs/downsizing, then they know it wasn't because you were a bad employee.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your job hunt!|`|6mVpfmR6aa	I would not try to sugarcoat the wording.  State the truth on your resume and perhaps be a little bit conservative (understate the truth).  Describe the short term assignment as "temporary".  Describe the lay off as a "termination", then leave it that way. If they call you, then explain why you were laid off.  <br>  <br>  This way you won't get interviews that lead to nothing, you will get few interviews.  However. with those few, the interviewer has already heard the worst about you before they met you and you have nowhere to go but up.  <br>  <br>  Trust me it is not worth taking a lot of interviews that lead nowhere.|`|TcMa4a7paa	A resume is a road map of your experience and should serve as a tool to sell yourself.  Never reveal on a resume reasons for leaving an employer.  <br>  Your resume should include your personal info, education, the name of the company (companies) you worked for, the dates of employment, your job title, and a list of responsibilities and/or accomplishments.  Save reasons for leaving a job for the interview.  Even during the interview, only volunteer reasons for leaving if you think it will clarify doubts the interviewer may have.

gbCB0ohJaa	As soon as you've been granted your degree, you can use the degree initials (Ph.D. or M.D. or DDS or whatever) after your name, or Dr. before your name (not both at the same time).  You don't use the title before the graduation ceremony.  And it's not really considered appropriate for a Ph.D. holder to use the title socially in a non-academic setting -- but it's kind of fun anyway, at least until the first thrill wears off.  <br>  <br>  You can get an earned doctorate in just about any field, but not at every university.

It has taken enough confidence and courage of individuals against the Church, resulting in a critical incident, divide the Catholic Church will Forever. Martin Luther, an Augustine monk bold, not only to start a their own and the most powerful institutions, but in the world led to a revolution, will be torn up throughout all of Western Europe apart from the dramatic reform and encouraged by the position of the people, they think what. <br>  The Black Death in 1348 from a fatal plague, also known as the Black Death, the entire Western European region rampant, resulting in around one-third of Europe's population. The disease, one of the towns and destroyed without any warning, last for at least two hundred years. Therefore, Europe experienced a great surge in piety remained throughout the 1400s. Ignorant people of God to punish them reason to believe that the criminal act. Mired in uncertainty and suffering, which will corrupt practices the Roman Catholic Church. In the beginning of the thirteenth century, the early Protestant reformers began to indicate thought, but it does not affect the Luther I (Linde August 9). <br>  In 1409, Jan Huss and Hussites, a large group of humanism, is the first Western European Christians to strive for and safeguard its independence in the Roman Catholic Church. Three years later, in 1411, Huss was condemned as heretics and burned at the Council of Constance is not recanting his teachings lead to the dissolution of groups. The concept of people-oriented, a religion, based on Greek and Roman philosophy and think, contains all the lessons of life to determine right and wrong, however, began to affect the thinking of scholars and students (Lohse 11 12). <br>  By the sixteenth century, two great scholars, Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus, the teachings of philosophy and its predecessor, mainly of the school system no longer continue. New scholars, such as challenges威廉奥卡姆synthesis of philosophy and theology, and led to some people turn to Germany with a human touch. In Italy, the Pope of Rome, Italy to enjoy the wealth of Italian Renaissance (Lohse 15). <br>  Need to change the Roman Catholic Church are inevitable. Beginning in the 16th century, questioned the practice of the Church, but many of the issues under siege. Financial abuse of the Pope. Clergy of the Church did not consider their responsibilities seriously. Bishop is one of the world consider themselves the rulers of, rather than priests. Not to practice chastity.

At each Congress a list of the German Empire, thus violating the Church has always presented, but has not been reformed. Fifth Lateran Council under Pope through a number of resolutions and reform from 1512 to 1517, but failed to prevent the sale of church offices or to prevent individuals from holding multiple offices. These acts and events are a harbinger of what to start a religious and political revolution, a monk and Pope (Lohse 10).<br>  During this time, the birth and life of Martin Luther change the course of history forever. Luther was born in November 10, 1483 in Eisleben in Thuringe, Lower Saxony, Hans and Magarethe Luder. Luther's parents are very strict and devout, the fear of God, Lutheran, also gave him the best education possible, hoping that he become a lawyer. Luther attended the University of Erfurt from his bachelor's degree, 1505. He will major in law, but the key moment of his life forever changed this decision (Somervill, Lohse). <br>  In the spring of 1505, Luther are back from spring break near Erfurt, lightning struck him and he vowed to become a monk. "St. Anne help me! I will become a monk!" (Somervill 9), he cried for fear. He gave up his education and joined the Augustinian monastery, the most stringent order of monks. "I really was a good monk and the rules to maintain order so that strict, I can say: If any passage of a monk monasticism heaven, I always think of the people," (Janz 77). Life such as monks, composed of self-discipline, punishment, daily prayer, repentance. When Luther suffered despair and are suspected of God, the head of John Frederick Augustine Staupitz orders to become a Lutheran pastor and a doctorate in theology. In 1507, Hart was appointed, and began teaching the University of Wittenburg. He will later imagine the conflict between their own and the Pope (Somervill, Janz 77). <br>  In 1517, to raise funds to rebuild St. Peter's Cathedral, Pope Leo X Pope funds to increase sales of plenary indulgences, it is believed that such assistance are the people in purgatory and go from purgatory.

An case example of an issue usually helps, because it makes the story easier to identify with.  E.g. <br>   Everyone loves a cute little puppy jumping up and down, trying to get the humans' attention, as it wags its tail and twists its body to show how much it wants attention.  The playful yips, floppy ears and paws that are much too big for the rest of the body complete a picture of a happy pet that is a joy to the new owner.  It is that sentiment that drives the unscrupulous breeders to produce pups in puppy mills, where the animals become a commodity and a source of income, and are discarded the moment they can no longer bring in a tidy profit.

oLI2SJ08aa	Roommates don't sleep that close together...me and my roommate organized it so that our beds are as far away as possible, but our desks are next to each other.<br>  <br>  My roommate and I are pretty chill. We have had a few "leaks", but we shrug it off and move on. It's happened to every girl at some point and it's not a big deal between females. If your roommate bugs you about it, then she's got some issues.<br>  <br>  If you don't get along with your roommate, there are ways to avoid her. You can be totally neurotic and memorize her schedule so that the two of you are never in the room at the same time, except for sleeping. Less extreme things would be to study somewhere else and only go in the room when you really need to.<br>  <br>  Discuss issues with your roommate EARLY. Especially little things, like turning on the light when you're sleeping or having guests over. If they do something that seriously bugs you, talk it out. Do not wait until the middle of second semester before you bring up how they always have their boyfriend over and it's distracting to you. If you two make a rule and she continually breaks it, talk to your RA. It's what they are there for.<br>  <br>  You cannot force your roommate to clean up their side of the room, but you can ask that if they are messy and you're neat, that they keep their stuff on their side.<br>  <br>  Designate what can and cannot be shared. Me and my roommate share food, textbooks and medicine, but not clothes. In general, it's nice to ask before borrowing any of your roommate's things.<br>  <br>  The best place for me to study is at the end of the hall. My dorm has a room at the end of each floor with couches and whiteboards and desks and chairs that is meant for group study. We also have all those things in the lobby and in the basement, near the laundry machines. It's pretty convenient. If you don't have this, try the library or a random hallway in an academic building that doesn't get much traffic. The laundry room itself is pretty quiet when it's not the weekend.<br>  <br>  I have a private bathroom that connects the bedroom I'm in with the bedroom next to me, so I can't answer anything about public showers.|`|8tLS1XDWaa	Its cool..I'm a junior in college and I went through this same thing when I lived in dorms, what I did was put a towel on top of my sheets before I went to bed.. Generally girls will understand if your on your period, just be clean about it and dispose of your hygenic products properly.. If you dont get along with your roomate you can always get another one.. its not a big deal... But I'm sure you'll get along with her... Dorm normally have a kitchen a lab and a laundry room on the floor and they can be same sex or both sexes... The showers look like showers.. lol.. and yes there should be a place to put your clothes while you study... The bathroom stalls are like those in a gym ... thats the best way to describe it.. the best place to study would be the library or a classroom or lab.. Good luck!!!
oLI2SJ08aa	'Miss' is a rather strong word...I have grown to appreciate my family a lot more while I have been in college. I no longer have to interact with them every day. Now, my relationship with my family is much more voluntary on my end, which has improved it tremendously. I actually talk much more to my family now that I'm in college than when I wasn't.<br>  <br>  If you really miss your family, invest in a web camera. There are a lot of free Internet video chat services (ooVoo, Skype, GTalk, etc). It's more personal than an email or a phone call. Allot time to visit them, but don't go home all of the time or you'll miss out on the college experience. I try to go home about once or twice a month.<br>  <br>  The first few days (or weeks) of college are hard, when you're adjusting. But you usually find your niche after a while, get into a routine and life is great! Join some clubs, reach out and make new friends, really take advantage of the opportunities you have.|`|AA10939258	my mom passed away about 3 years before i went to school, but i didnt miss my family too much.. you get soo busy with school and extracurricular, and you don't really have time to think about that stuff...you may miss them, but getting a good education at a school you really love is more important than not seeing family every day (just think of all the people you will meet, and someday, you wont be living with your parents hopefully, you will have a life on your own, so why not practice now)

However, it takes a lot of time and it really is a serious business as you are dealing with lives.

Surgeons definitely make more money than psychologists, but if you are considering raising a family in the future maybe it would be too demanding time-wise. If you really do want to be a surgeon though, consider being a plastic surgeon because their malpractice insurance is much less, and you get to set your own schedule the majority of the time.|`|rwSF29Izaa	The rewards for both are too numerous to mention. Here are a few negatives to consider:<br>  <br>  Surgeon: Lots of liability -- people are sue-happy these days, high liability insurance premiums that double every 4-5 years, death of the general surgeon (most people specialize), total years of college = 14; 4 undergrad, 4 med. school, 4 residency, 2 surgical fellowship.<br>  <br>  Psychologist: High burnout -- extremely mentally taxing profession, surgeons' patients get well with tangible results; psychologists patients can be ill for decades or get worse/deteriorate, personal guilt/personal involvement of professional relationships difficult to separate from personal relationships.<br>  <br>  Interesting question.<br>  <br>  <br>  ******** Note regarding what poster wrote about plastic surgeons**********<br>  <br>  Most doctors file insurance and are at the mercy of what insurance companies agree to pay; i.e. "reasonable and necessary" is code for "as little as we feel like paying".<br>  <br>  Most plastic surgeons work with elective patients and receive 100% of their charges up front. Most other doctors receive a $20 copay and whatever the insurance company feels like paying months down the road. Plastic surgery is an excellent option as a surgeon.|`|AA10952792	it takes years and about $100,000 to become a surgeon. Or maybe even more money than that. and to be a psychologist, you really need a Ph.d or at least a master's since since a B.A. in psychology is really a dime a dozen if you want to further in that field. Both are going to require time and money, but i think a surgeon requires more of both. and plus it depends on whether or not you can handle being a med student with little or no social life.

J.P. was a willing student. J.P. was educated at Boston's English High School, and then he enrolled in Germany's prestigious University of Gottingen. By the time he was 15, J.P. had traveled throughout much of Europe, and had already begun collecting art, which would remain a passion throughout his life. When he was 20, he graduated from Gottingen, and returned to New York to begin his career in finance. He started as an accountant for Duncan, Sherman & Co. in New York City. This position provided a good base for J.P. Morgan's introduction into the world of banking and finance, especially because of its ties to the powerful London firm of George Peabody & Co. As the Civil War broke out, Morgan joined his father's financial ventures, and operated out of both New York and London, all the time increasing his personal holdings. From 1864 to 1871 he was an increasingly influential member of the firm Dabney, Morgan & Co., and in 1871 he became a partner in Drexel, Morgan & Co. In 1895, this firm became J.P.

Id4OLpIZaa	That's a tough decision. Do you think it will open a few doors to a better job? Or will it make you overqualified for your current job? Your boss may see your advancement as a threat to his/her own job, thus may make life harder on you forcing you to quit. On the other hand, getting a masters can also open the opportunity to salary increase and promotions.<br>  <br>  Also in this current economy, you must consider job security. If you feel uncertain, a masters degree may be beneficial to help you stand out from the crowd if the unspeakable (laid off) happens. In the downside, you would have to devote time to both work and school and can hurt your performance at work, thus giving a reason for laying you off from work. <br>  <br>  Do you also have a family to care of? If so, you might want to think twice or consult with them.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, Best of luck. Only you could decide.If it was me, I would do it just for the prestige to say I have a masters. And perhaps go even further and get a Ph.D just for the sake of being called Doctor. hahahaha.|`|nZynoCVKaa	yes, if u are going to get one, it will create better and more job opportunitys|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	Of course, it is!

5qvWITGkaa	I have noticed that some upstaters sound a little Southern. I once attended a certain church in New York City for several weeks, and from his speech I kept wondering if the preacher was from the South. Turned out he was from upstate. I have noticed this particularity in others from that area as well. I have not studied it, but this closeness probably comes from a similarity in the pronunciation of vowels.<br>  <br>  If you are from Noo Yoik City, I have no answer other than perhaps you just like the sound from hearing it in movies, and when you are "relaxed" you subconsciously imitate it. This also could pertain if you are from upstate, as well.<br>  <br>  Anyway, most persons like the sound, so just keep ohn, sugah.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	yes. a REAL country....<br>  <br>  Maybe your from the south?|`|5UpTGrFZaa	maybe you were raised around southern people when you were really young, too young to remember

BSnwIJ0oaa	Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti<br>  <br>  Brahma = Supreme Entity (from brhat, meaning "great")<br>  Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti.<br>  This is the basic concept of A'nanda Ma'rga philosophy -- that the Supreme Entity is One but has two aspects: the Cognitive Principle and the Operative Principle, Shiva and Shakti. It is impossible to conceive of one entity without the other; Consciousness and Its Energy of creation are as inseparable as fire and its heat, as milk and its whiteness, as two sides of a piece of paper. This concept has often been depicted symbolically in the image of a hermaphrodite (man and woman in the same body), or in Indian sculpture as two lovers locked in a tight embrace. In this su'tra the term "a'tmakam'" has been used to express the relationship: Brahma is the composite of, the combined name of, Consciousness and the Operative Principle. Brahma is not a third entity.<br>  The one same Entity To the limited, clouded human mind, the pure Consciousness and the creation which is the product of Shakti seem to be different and separate; but through meditation this duality is transcended and the sa'dhaka (spiritual practitioner) perceives both as the one imperishable Brahma. The saint Ra'makrs'n'a tells the following story: "Once a king asked a yogi to impart knowledge to him in one word. The yogi said, 'All right; you will get knowledge in one word.' The king then saw the magician moving two of his fingers rapidly and heard him exclaim, 'Behold, O king, behold.' The king looked at him amazed when, after a few minutes, he saw the two fingers becoming one. The magician moved that one finger rapidly and said, 'Behold, O king! Behold!'" The implication of this story is that Shiva and the Primal Energy (Shakti) at first appear to be two. But after attaining knowledge of Brahma, one does not see the two. Then there is no differentiation; it is One, without a second -- non-duality. Are Shiva and Shakti two different entities? No, certainly not. Of course, in philosophical discourse, to make it intelligible to the common people these two terms are employed separately, out of great necessity aforesaid, but verily they are not only inseparably related but are interdependent just like milk and its whiteness, and like fire and its consuming power. In the course of sa'dhana' (intuitional practice), when the aspirant finds Shakti<br>  receding into Shiva then he comes to himself. So long as he entertains distinction between Shiva and Shakti and consequently between Brahma and self, he tries in vain to attain the bliss and goes on entangling himself more and more in the web of sam'ska'ras [potential reactions to one's actions]. The more you go ahead in your sa'dhana' of Shiva, the more you will observe that the Cosmic Force (Shakti) gets merged in you in a surrendered state. The ancient scriptures proclaim, "There is nothing whatever that is not divine... to know all as illusion is ignorance, to know all as Consciousness is knowledge." Thus the spiritual aspirant does not bemoan the transitoriness of the world; to him, change itself reveals the Spirit that inspires the changing forms.<br>  Nirgun'a and Sagun'a Brahma<br>  Brahma exists in two states. The first is a completely transcendent state, not "qualified" or affected in any way by the Operative Principle and Her three gun'as or binding energy forces. Here Brahma is called "gun'atiita" or "beyond the gun'as" and Shakti is unexpressed (anucchu'nya'). Thus Nirgun'a Brahma is not associated in any way with the creation (except through Ta'raka Brahma). The second state is Sagun'a Brahma, a state "qualified" or operated on by the three gun'as. In Sagun'a Brahma, Shakti does influence Shiva. She is often portrayed symbolically as dancing on the body of Shiva, for in the infinite body of pure Consciousness She plays, transforming that pure Consciousness into cruder vibrations, so that creation may come into existence. Shiva is merely lying flat, not acting, merely witnessing Her dance. In this state Shakti is called "ucchu'nya'", "expressed", "manifested", or "exhausted" -- because in the process of creation She exhausts Herself. When She is influencing the pure Consciousness thus, She is also called "Prakrti", the "force creating kinds or diversity": "Pra" (kinds) "karoti" (does, creates) "iti" (thus) "Prakrti". Sagun'a Brahma and the creation which issues forth from it are like icebergs of qualified Consciousness in a vast ocean of unqualified Nirgun'a Brahma. But these two, Sagun'a and Nirgun'a Brahma, do not represent duality; they are rather two different states of one Entity. In one state, Brahma is sleeping; in the other it is wakeful. A person is not a different person while sleeping and while awake; similarly Brahma is the same Entity, but existing in two different conditions.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Brahma is a highly respected major god figure.

855fc218880a34479886ce4e939ad8dbaa	Your debate will have a main point that you have to show. In today's society, a manly man is not emotional. He is logical and strong. Being lead by emotions is a female trait. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but we all know that sensitive guys are hardly the strong manly guys that we think of. This is the point you have to make.<br>  I wrote this going up and down, up and down, so I might have repeated this, or explained things twice, etc.<br>  <br>  So, here are some points:<br>  Today's "manly man" has quite a few qualities that make him such, things Romeo does not seem to possess. While being physically strong has remained a constant manly quality over the centuries, emotional and intellectual qualities have changed dramatically. Today, being emotionally stoic is seen as a male trait. Romeo, however, is a very romantic man. He is highly sensitive and cries multiple times in the play, which is a sign of weakness.<br>  <br>  He lets emotions completely drive him. While many feminists would like to disagree, feminine traits are seen as weak, especially in men. Romeo is instantly enamored by Juliet when he first sees her. Such strong emotions are indicative of femininity. Also, instead of following logic, he commits suicide after hearing of Juliet's "death." Also, poetry reciting is something we see today as being bizarre, and while women might find it sweet, it is not manly.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rebuttal:<br>  Should the opponent mention something about how sensitive men are seen as a good quality, you could come back with how sensitivity is something many people associate with gay people. This might bring up a huge "WHOA!" but it is true. And you have to assert your position, because it is true. And make sure you get them to understand that while it is a "shocking" thing to say, you make them understand that in the back of their minds, they know that you are right. There is also the emo trend that many seem to look down on and are rarely seen as a manly quality. Assure them that it is not a negative trait, but definitely not a manly one. No one associates a strong man with sensitivity, except in those random sayings where they say "It takes a big man to cry" and nonsense like that.<br>  <br>  If they say something about women liking men who are sensitive, and how that is seen as a manly thing, assure them that attractiveness to the opposite sex has nothing to do with this. Women might like the idea of a man who shares emotions, but time after time, women seek the attention of the so called "bad boy," who seems to take control of the woman because that is what women today perceive as what a natural man should be. <br>  <br>  He might go into the idea that Romeo was physically strong, being able to kill Tybalt in a fight. But we have to look at the situation here. Today, there is a subtle connotation that men follow logic while women are more prone to follow their emotions. During calm times, Romeo was able to keep away from Tybalt and even refused to fight him because he was in love with Juliet, which was a fairly logical decision to make. However, when Mercutio was killed, emotions took over and all logic was thrown out and Romeo was lead completely by emotions. Once again, being lead by emotions is a feminine trait, making him look like a weaker man in today's eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  REMEMBER! What women might like does not indicate manliness. Make this point clear. Your opponent might use this very strongly and try to convince that this is what makes a man. You have to note that women might want that "good sensitive" guy out of practically, but are still strongly attracted to that "bad boy" manly man.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

f225326bcf00f7734680a1c78941fabbaa	The real problem you're facing is time management. Don't think about doing ONE problem in 1 min and 30 seconds, the mere fact you know that means you are stressing too much on one problem. The trick is to do problems that don't require much work first. Even if you know how to do one problem, it might require too much time that will add to your time problem and also create some mental stress telling your mind that you are running out of time. One you finish all your easy/fast problems, go BACK to the ones you know. After you finish these, go to the problems that require the most work. Once you realize which problems are fast and which aren't, you will master time management.

AA10067221	Booker T. Washington Biography<br>  Educator<br>  Born a slave and deprived of any early education, Booker Taliaferro Washington nonetheless became America's foremost black educator of the early 20th century. He was the first teacher and principal of the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, a school for African-Americans where he championed vocational training as a means for black self-reliance. A well-known orator, Washington also wrote a best-selling autobiography (Up From Slavery, 1901) and advised Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft on race relations. His rather flaccid nickname of "The Great Accommodator" provides a clue as to why he was later criticized by W. E. B. Du Bois and the N.A.A.C.P. Washington was principal of Tuskegee Institute from 1881 until his death in 1915; it was originally called the Normal School for Colored Teachers and is now known as Tuskegee University. <br>  <br>  <br>   “Washington worked tirelessly to persuade black and white people that the surest way for black people to advance was by learning skills and demonstrating a willingness to do manual labor.”[xv] Washington, virtually single-handedly, ran the Tuskegee Institute; hard work was pushed as the means for African- Americans to earn respect within society. Washington’s diligence led to the growth of the Tuskegee Institute; he garnered vast educational contributions from the wealthy, which he used to help the college expand. <br>  <br>  Beyond his accomplishments in the field of education, Washington well regarded and formed connections within both the black and white communities. He became a prominent leader whose political connections reached all the way to the White House. Throughout his life, he remained a pragmatic conservative who sought to assist African- Americans in expanding their economic success in order to take responsibility for their future as a people.

BHIiO22taa	This is a great topic to research! How about looking into the number of people who have cell phones now vs several years ago? In the early 90s having a "car phone" was a huge deal and now it seems everyone on the road is chatting on their cell. Also look at marketing - technology is being marketed to younger and younger age groups, teaching them to become dependent on it an lazy at younger ages. Also you could argue that technology aimed toward children makes parents lazy -- they just stick junior with nintendo and don't play with them themselves. A lot of research can be done by looking at advertisements. In a Sunday paper, make a tally of how many ads are selling technological products that make people lazier? Good luck with this!

kPeLbKr1aa	Well, there are several ways to look at this question.  First is whether or not one believes in "The Great Man" view of history.  This is the idea that history was shaped by the actions and decisions of singular individuals, in which case one would argue that Hitler was calling all the shots and is directly responsible for the consequences of those decisions.  <br>  <br>  Another way to look at this is that everyone involved in both the starting of the World War II and those that executed the Holocaust are responsible b/c the action of systematically killing people or starting a massive war are evil.  Is the person who led many Jews to the gas chambers just as responsible as the policy maker (in this case Hitler) who ordered the killings?  The answer seems to be no b/c the Nuremberg defense (or the defense that "I was just following orders") was not adequate defense for those charged.<br>  <br>  A third way to look at this is to view history as a collection of several factors that are independent of any individual's actions.  Was it the great depression and excessive punishment's from the Treaty of Versailles that led Germany to initiate WWII?  Was it some sort of ingrained anti-semitic cultural attitude that had existed for centuries, coupled with new ethical understandings and technological advances that allowed hate to manifest itself in the form of the holocaust?  Were these actions inevitable?  <br>  <br>  I think, as with most things in history, it's probably a combination of all factors.  You have the historical/cultural setting that allows for someone like Hitler to come to power and makes those underneath him amenable to certain acts that might normally be unthinkable.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Cheers!|`|Z41B2MwSaa	It is Hitler's fault for establishing the practice and giving the order.|`|GLMiQUcGaa	The first person who answered should get there facts straight america was the only country that did not impose reparations on Germany we thought the Versailles peace agreement was much to harsh, so it was in no way America's fault we can be blamed for many things but that's not one of them. Also Reparations for war damages was standard practice in europe for a long time leading up to this so Germany would have done the same thing had they won.<br>  It is both Hitlers fault, and the people who went to along with it. No excuses for them not saying that everyone in germany was bad, but they defiantly are at fault for turning a blind eye.

I did this for a project in college and everyone loved it. You need to know what you are going to say though.

Something along those same lines<br>  Games- Make a game out of the subject and let the whole class participate. Examples would be memory,.. jeopardy, zonk, etc.<br>  Food- anything to with food.

p3Er94Smaa	The best thing is to sit down in a quiet place or have your music on if you like to multitask. I know how this feels, I take 3 AP courses plus i have a job that takes a lot of my time. Don't feel frustrated, trust me just make a list of all you have to do, begin with the easiest first or the hardest whatever makes you more comfortable and set a specific time to finish. For example give yourself an hour to finish the math, work 45 minutes on the term papers, leave the studying for last and so on. Then  you can check off your list whatever you get done and also don't forget to treat yourself. Reward yourself by eating a cookie after finishing an assigment or whatever you feel or maybe a 5 minute break. Now get off from here and get down to business ;)|`|lzEuuseJaa	Prioritize!<br>  Do it in writing, not in your head.<br>  <br>  Write down which assignments are due when.

Otherwise, go with metaphor.|`|vjC5FVDaaa	Metaphor. <br>  <br>  Definition of a metaphor is comparing to completely different things that have obvious or inobvious means of relation without using like or as.<br>  <br>  If the sentence continued to talk about parrots, it would become irony.

2Y9pejG6aa	2.  Don't start the sentence with when.  Start it with 'She'.<br>  3. 'Who's' is wrong.  It should be 'whose'.  'Belong' should be 'belonged'.  But the sentence is a bit funny anyway - as she is wondering 'whose body a corpse belonged to'.  It should probably read 'She was tormented about whose corpse she had found'.<br>  5.  You need another 'for'.  Otherwise it sounds as though she had been searching her father, not searching FOR her father.  The sentence should read 'she realized it was her father's body, who she had been searching for for weeks'.  Or if you don't like the sound of the repeated word (I don't), you could say 'she realized it was her father's body; she had been searching for him for weeks.'  Using a semicolon is always nice.|`|uiRL7K2Oaa	100%|`|I3ZehRGEaa	2 is grammatically incorrect (sentence fragment).

xdtrl0nSaa	If you think you can handle it, I'd say go for it.  But know that it will be rigorous and will require time and commitment from you as in any other endeavor.  Try and reflect what you would like to go into as a career after graduating from high school (I know it's too early yet but you might be one of those whose got his plans all laid out for the future).  This class can be mighty useful in the field of sciences and engineering. So, decide for yourself and not because you have friends who are taking it, too.  Know your strengths and limitations.  If the grades you stated here are not the inflated ones, then you are certainly quite qualified to take this class.  Have fun with it.  Freshman year is usually the time when a lot of things happen and most students get into trouble because they have a lot of time in their hand.

El Salvador did not have sufficient industrial technology for making powerful arms to fight against the communist threat or against the guerrilla. Cuba also helped the guerrilla by training people for fighting against the government, etc. USA did not want the communism to spread in Latin America, and El Salvador was in danger, according to the American intelligence. So the United States did get involved in the war, and Cuba did it too. The war lasted 12 years, from 1980 until 1992, so as you can imagine, there is a lot of information about this war on the Internet, and you will not have problems for finding tons of documents about it. But remember that every person saw the war from a different point of view. Some people think the guerrilla was right, and some other people think that the government was right. So you could find biased documents, and probably even lies about what really happened.

ljzb6fZBaa	I used to be very quiet and shy when I was in secondary school. I seldom talked in class, and I would go home after school, instead of hanging out with friends. I was not sociable, and I would just concentrate on my studies to get good grades. It is only in university I started to open up a bit, and I was invited to join a christian fellowship group every week to participate in their Bible study. I didn't consider myself a Christian then, but I think that experience helped me to be comfortable with myself, and be open to God. A few years later, after starting work, I was invited to a church again, and I decided to accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour. Today, I am not so shy, and I am trusting in the Lord on how to relate to people instead of trusting in my own confidence. Maybe the first step you can do to improve your people skills is to find a church nearby or christian fellowship group in your school or neighbourhood. I believe the believers in Christ are friendly and will welcome you in their midst. You will make new friends easily, and you will find faith and new confidence in being the person whom God made you to be. What you need is the love of God in your heart. When you know you are loved by God, it will be easy for you to love other people too. You will unconsciously break out of your shell and talk to people, wanting to help them or know them better or make their lives better, all because He first loved you.<br>  <br>  God bless you, my friend.|`|IHIiyyCTaa	You just need to break the ice then you be fine...|`|0iZ0tRDOaa	I used to be exactly like you a couple years ago, but when I was a freshman I enrolled in Junior ROTC in my high school.

05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	You take the lyrics of a song and just change them by using science words. The song should still make sense and fit the tune.

gbCB0ohJaa	Why do you need to convince your father?  You shouldn't give your father the idea you need his permission or approval.  Just let him know courteously what you are going to do - e-mail sometimes makes this kind of thing easier.  <br>  <br>  I see now that another respondent considers the possibility that your father is supporting you financially.   Are you prepared for the possibility that he might try to withhold money in order to get you to do what he wants?  Do you have alternatives that would make you less financially dependent, such as going to school part time and working part time?  <br>  <br>  One option that some people's parents find more palatable - and which can be a healthier situation for young couples as well - is to look at both living in a house or apartment with other people, instead of just the two of you.  Or to spend next academic year living in different households in the same neighbourhood, which would still give you more time together than you have now.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Here are my comments. Definately nothing abusive.<br>  <br>  1 - Fathers expect their daughters to remain virgins all of their lives. Even when they get married. That's what the man thinks. But of course, he knows that is not the case but that is his fantasy.<br>  <br>  2 - You did not state whether your father is paying for your tuition. If he is, forget the plan. Just have bf stay over and be a "half live-in". Hmmmm...well...you need the place off campus...so...you both have to sign.<br>  <br>  3 - Okay. You are of age to have this relationship including the physical one. You say this has not happened yet but 99% of girls say that and the remaining 1% just lie. My opinion is, that you have a physical relationship. So what. You're a grown up.<br>  <br>  4 - Dad may be more accommodating than you think. A dinner date with dad - without bf - would be the way to tell him. That way the matter can be discussed and you have to assert your grownupness during this time. You seek his approval and he will see that.<br>  <br>  The only snag is, that if he is paying for your schooling. He could threaten to pull the financial plug. In that case, consider how much this means to you and if you really feel he will cut off finances forget the whole idea.<br>  <br>  But there is hope. Fathers change their minds after they warm to the idea :))
0lnamekJaa	Which one?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_clark" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_c...</a><br>  <br>  The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1803–1806), headed by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, was the first American overland expedition to the Pacific coast and back.<br>  <br>  The Lewis and Clark expedition was only the second recorded transcontinental crossing of North America north of Mexico by a person not of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, having been preceded to the Pacific coast (on July 20, 1793) by a Canadian expedition led by explorer Sir Alexander Mackenzie. Mackenzie had previously crossed North America in 1789 as well, but had turned north at the Continental Divide, also becoming the first European to reach the western Arctic Ocean.<br>  <br>  In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase sparked interest in expansion to the west coast. The United States did not know just what it was buying, and even France was unsure how much land it was selling. A few weeks after the purchase, President Thomas Jefferson, an advocate of western expansion, had Congress appropriate $2,500 for an expedition. In a message to Congress, Jefferson wrote:<br>  <br>  "The river Missouri, and Indians inhabiting it, are not as well known as rendered desirable by their connection with the Mississippi, and consequently with us.... An intelligent officer, with ten or twelve chosen men ... might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean..."[1]<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson had long thought about such an expedition, but was concerned about the danger. While in France from 1785–1789, he had heard of numerous plans to better explore the Pacific Northwest. In 1785, Jefferson learned that King Louis XVI of France planned to send a mission there, reportedly as a mere scientific expedition. Jefferson found that doubtful, and evidence provided by John Paul Jones confirmed these doubts. In either event, the mission was destroyed by bad weather after leaving Botany Bay in 1788. In 1786 John Ledyard, who had sailed with Captain James Cook to the Pacific Northwest, told Jefferson that he planned to walk across Siberia, ride a Russian fur-trade vessel to cross the ocean, and then walk all the way to the American capital. Since Ledyard was an American, Jefferson hoped he would succeed. Ledyard had made it as far as Siberia when Empress Catherine the Great had him arrested and deported back to Poland.[2]<br>  <br>  The American expedition to the Pacific northwest was intended to study the Indian tribes, botany, geology, Western terrain and wildlife in the region, as well as evaluate the potential interference of British and French Canadian hunters and trappers who were already well established in the area.<br>  <br>  Jefferson selected Captain Meriwether Lewis to lead the expedition, afterwards known as the Corps of Discovery. In a letter dated June 20, 1803, Jefferson wrote to Lewis<br>  <br>  The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, and such principal stream of it as by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct and practicable water communication across this continent for the purposes of commerce.[3]<br>  <br>  Lewis selected William Clark as his partner. Because of bureaucratic delays in the U.S. Army, Clark officially only held the rank of Second Lieutenant at the time, but Lewis concealed this from the men and shared the leadership of the expedition, always referring to Clark as "Captain".[4]<br>  <br>  Native American relations<br>  Another achievement of the Lewis and Clark Expedition was that it established friendly relations with some of the Native Americans. Without the help of the Native Americans, the expedition would have starved to death or gotten hopelessly lost in the Rocky Mountains.[12] The expedition was especially indebted to a Shoshone woman named Sacagawea, who served as a guide and interpreter. The sight of a woman and her infant son would have been a reassuring sight to Native Americans who might have mistaken the armed explorers as a group on a warlike mission.[17] For the most part, encounters between the three dozen Indian tribes and the expedition were successful.[12] Author James Ronda states "Lewis and Clark matter today because they act as a benchmark by which we can measure change and continuity in everything from the environment to relations between peoples".[18]<br>  <br>  Lewis and Clark may not have found the elusive Northwest Passage and were not the first to explore the west, but as Robert Archibald states, "they were the first United States citizens to have described the place officially".[19] The fact that they were a scientific expedition was extremely important, especially during the age of the Enlightenment. The new knowledge they obtained about the Northwest's geography, natural resources, and native inhabitants sparked American interest in the west, and strengthened the nation's claim to the area.|`|uiRL7K2Oaa	lewis and clark, but thomas jefferson came up with the idea|`|y1FqSk0haa	Sacagawea|`|8VBU5gjEaa	sacajaweah right (killed that spelling)|`|oDAN4WkBaa	with some help of sacagewea    <br>  idk if thats spelt rite
yJZeRu5Vaa	be more interesting|`|V8qlpkoZaa	This is a hard one to answer because-as typical as it sounds-everyone is unique. You can't just follow the actions of an interesting movie star because then you're just copying them, and it's individuality that is interesting. What you CAN do is to watch a lot of interesting movie or TV characters, watch a lot of comedians (best with more appropriate, less sexual-joke-based. My favorites are Mitch Hedberg and Eddie Izzard) and see how their STYLE makes them funny. Just having their own way of talking, their own way of  expressing themselves.<br>  A big part of being interesting is knowledge-based, which is GREAT because that's something you can easily acquire! learn about interesting topics that you can talk to others about. Learn about the topic your peers are interested in so that you can discuss it with them.<br>  <br>  To be able to be interesting be bing your unique self, you have to figure out who you are, what makes you different, why you like the things you do, etc. And embrace it! Be different and enjoy it! Be one of the people who thrives on life instead of getting down about every little thing. People watch and learn to see the intriguing differences in other people. <br>  <br>  That's all I've got for now, I hope it helps, and good luck!
TG7mwNRfaa	It means to hit someone. <br>  <br>  Like, my mum used to tell me if I was doing something bad, "If you don't stop, I'm gonna crack you one!", aka, I'm gonna beat your butt unless you knock it off!<br>  <br>  It can also be used in a more violent sense, of course, as in: "Man, I hate that girl, she's such a brat. I could really crack her a good one sometimes." Basically meaning, "I'd like to slap/hit/beat her sometimes."<br>  <br>  Of course, this particular sense of meaning for the word could just be a localised thing. It may not mean quite the same thing where you come from.|`|HUopAh4iaa	It means "Break someone down."

o96wvl3naa	It means you've seen/heard it but haven't registered that you've seen it.<br>  So if a TV program hides the message "go make a cup of tea" within the program you mind wouldn't register seeing it but your subconscious will make you go and make a cup of tea. It is a difficult thing to understand but i hope i have helped.|`|jgPJtlEaaa	Well because subliminal is something occurring in the brain it's hard to define. I don't know if breathing counts because it's automatically controlled by the brain but we can think about it (bring in into consciousness) and change it. Another subliminal phenomenon was in older movies. There would be ads flashed in between film frames that the brain would see subliminally and you would feel the desire to go buy popcorn or a drink or something. Hope that helps.|`|P4I2dCS5aa	Not particularily hidden, but unbeknownst to a target audience. This correlates immediately with the concept of existing or operating below the threshold of consciousness; wherein a concept or idea is fed to an audience without their consent or foreknowledge.|`|8eMM6l13aa	it means that its not out in the open... hidden in other words.<br>  kinda like subliminal messages... how they were messages put in a movie but you would have to pay attention and look for it. It wouldn't be obvious..<br>  :)|`|eRQ5MX2aaa	www.dictionary.com|`|IRb2riTraa	hidden|`|HUopAh4iaa	okay take the example "Subliminal message" they used to do this when you were watching a movie in the 50's and 60's. They would flash words on the movie screen for a nano second between the actual pictures. You- the conscious you did not see it. But your subconscious saw it and would react to it. They flashed words like "Popcorn or Coke" or Quiet. It was a form of control. Not used much today for fear of a law suit but anyway. Hopefully you can understand the meaning now.
zCHnMeXbaa	This is going to upset some people, but oh well.<br>  <br>  Teenagers do not effectively contribute to society.  <br>  They do not pay taxes to support society.  <br>  They have not yet established an occupation.<br>  Our society is premised on an individual earning his or her place in society; their social identity.  Teenagers are just starting to earn their place in society since they have yet to graduate high school.<br>  Our societal norms are based on what is considered adult maturity in decision making.  Society does not consider teenagers responsible and mature enough to make decisions regarding voting, alcohol and cigarette purchasing.  Teenagers are still under the guardianship of their parents or other adults until the age of 18 or in some cases 21 years of age.|`|XaAlNqjXaa	Don't worry yourself about whether or not someone is offended every time you pose a question...<br>  As for the debate topic, I would create a defense based on facts.  In other words, teenagers are victims of the statistics that are compiled year after year on their driving records.  There's no need to stereotype when the facts prove that they are the drivers getting into the most accidents and so on.   If adults were driving more dangerously, then they should be the ones paying more for car insurance.  <br>  Also, based on their driving records, the right to buy alcohol at that age should be based on the facts only.|`|JoyIIiZ6aa	It may seem that teens are victims of ...., but upon closer examination one can easily see why it is necessary for the laws and the society to see teens in a way different than younger children, or adults.  Teenage-hood is a time of tumultuous changes, both physical and emotional.  In many ways there seems to be a disconnect between the brain and the emotions, as teens lash out, allow themselves to be manipulated and exploited, or fall prey to unscrupulous adults.  Therefore, what seems like prejudice or discrimination is simply a way of society to protect the teens both from the undue influences and their own immaturity.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|PiQKC4COaa	It is interesting to note that throughout American history the age that a person is considered an adult has gone up from 13 to 15 to 18. Why is this? It is because not only has the life expectancy increased but it has been proven that teenagers are irresponsible. During the teen years it is a known fact that teenagers are hormonal and are still developing into the people they are meant to be. Why would you want to trust the decision of voting to someone who can not even care for themselves? If we are to lower the age at which a teen can vote & buy cigarettes they should also the age that they are considered an adult.|`|qAGeCYVlaa	Well number one decreasing car insurance rates and promoting drinking is a very stupid thing to do, because teenagers are already drinking and driving and it's not even legal! Also, everyone is a victim to stereotyping and teenagers are the ones who are usually doing it.<br>  <br>  I also recommend that you research some points that would agree with those statements so that way you know what your opponent has to throw and you and you can discredit them ahead of time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nE6QAFSlaa	umm some ideas might be.....<br>  <br>  -they don't really care about who runs the country at 16<br>  -if they have alcohol sooner the year they start drinving, more drunk driving accidents may occur...<br>  <br>  yeah that's all i got. sorry.
O3CrGKw4aa	While still in high school, you should plan a strong college preparatory program with courses in English, humanities subjects, mathematics, including geometry, trigonometry, algebra, and pre-calculus, and physics.<br>  <br>  Art courses - drawing, painting, sculpture, or photography - will be helpful in developing your ability to visualize and conceptualize, both important skills to an architect.<br>  <br>  Elective courses in computers and business will be extremely helpful in preparing for a career in architecture.<br>  <br>  In most States, the professional degree in architecture must be from one of the 114 schools of architecture that have degree programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. However, State architectural registration boards set their own standards, so graduation from a non-accredited program may meet the educational requirement for licensing in a few States.<br>  <br>  Three types of professional degrees in architecture are available: a 5-year bachelor’s degree, which is most common and is intended for students with no previous architectural training; a 2-year master’s degree for students with an undergraduate degree in architecture or a related area; and a 3- or 4-year master’s degree for students with a degree in another discipline.<br>  <br>  The choice of degree depends on preference and educational background. Prospective architecture students should consider the options before committing to a program. For example, although the 5-year bachelor of architecture offers the fastest route to the professional degree, courses are specialized, and if the student does not complete the program, transferring to a program in another discipline may be difficult. A typical program includes courses in architectural history and theory, building design with an emphasis on CADD, structures, technology, construction methods, professional practice, math, physical sciences, and liberal arts. Central to most architectural programs is the design studio, where students apply the skills and concepts learned in the classroom, creating drawings and three-dimensional models of their designs.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|z2IUgVOXaa	not sure about the college years but focus on art and math. lots of math.

trKgx3Ukaa	The GPA is most important immediately after graduation and you are looking for your first 'real' career job. This applies not only to the big multi-national firms of any description, but pretty much any firm that takes on graduates straight out of college/university. The reason for this is that a new graduate usually doesn't have much of a track record in the workforce relating to the particular job on offer, and so they need to find ways of differentiating all the applicants. A GPA is very clear cut, and some firms take this as the first cut-off point for selecting for an interview. <br>  <br>  However, once you have become established in your career and are looking for your next career move, nobody looks at your GPA anymore. What really matters at this stage is how well you performed in you most recent job post-graduation. At this point, you can pretty much pack away your transcript, other than to prove that you have a degree (rarely necessary due to you having proven track record in your chosen profession). <br>  <br>  In conclusion therefore, yes, a strong GPA is important immediately after you graduate. After that, it is of no further consequence other than to open doors to graduate study. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|vyVDWIehaa	If you are planning on working for Big 6 accounting firms or in investment baking at top competitive firms, they will probably ask for your GPA.<br>  <br>  Outside of that, having a low GPA might cost you a particular job, but you can ALWAYS find a similar job where they won't ask you for your college GPA.  So, essentially, yes, it only matters for grad school.<br>  <br>  However, most people who have near a 4.0 from college, will attempt to go to grad school of some sort sometime in the future.  And people with 2.0s probably won't even try at least at first, so it's not like GPA is useless.

AA10276327	The annual camping trip of Imperial  Racoon Lodge had begun..  It was the 2nd anniversary for Ralph who looked forward to this weekend.  As they gathered around the campfire, he broke into song, “ Poison iv-y-y-y-y, poison iv-y-y-y-y” (1).  The bittersweet memories of years gone by, when he had used those leaves for toilet paper came rushing back. He quickly checked his back pack, “Compass, band-aids, lip balm.....Thank GAWD, moose repellent” (2) and, he thought to himself  “a roll of Charmin.“<br>  <br>  “Hey Ralph, you remember when you brought Alice on this trip?” said Ed laughingly.  “She just vanished.....Like WHOOSH, man (3) when she heard a few hootie owls that first night. <br>  By the way, Tell that hillbilly with the missing front teeth to stop playing "Dueling Banjos" on his harmonica!! (4) Who brought him as a guest anyway?”<br>  <br>  The lodge members looked at each other, No one claimed him.  The music stopped. It was just then that twigs cracked, thunder crashed and a howl from the depths of hell echoed throughout the valley. (5) <br>  <br>  Ralph was the first to speak. “It just occurred to me, I have an appointment to get my hair cut.” Ed chimed in too” Saddle up, boys.(6) We can’t let Ralph face the follicle surgery alone.”<br>  <br>  With those words, the Imperial Racoon Lodge packed up their tent, walked across the lawn and went in the backdoor of Ralph’s home.

Yes, go to a rich white-majority school, and they meet AYP. Go to a minority school or poor school and they don't. So, do you want to be a segregated rich-school teacher or a hero who tries to overcome the inequalities? Either way, you won't be able to even buy a house, with the thousands you spend each year on supplies--if you teach at the poor school. Think this through carefully. Not all schools are like the one you attended, and public eduation in this nation is a disgrace.

But you can convince her that there is a lot more that you can do than becoming a nurse. Its just a matter of making her understand your goals. You need to tell her about your dreams. You can do that by telling her all the good qualities that you have for pursuing a good career in graphic designing and he tough and vulnerable life of nursing. Though, both these careers are good but the you need to go for what you are passionate about. <br>  I'm giving you a link where you will be able to find all about nursing and graphic degrees. You can tell your mom about the good opportunities that are available for you. Moreover, you can also apply for online degree for graphic designing on this site.

I went through that stage, hated the program I was in and left school for a year. Then I decided to go back for something I wanted to do and I'm doing much better now. <br>  <br>  She's your mum and loves you and has undoubtedly done a lot for you.

636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	how about a speech that touches on the facts about progeria as well as the social impact--i.e., what is it like to have this disease or to have someone in your family who has it? this is a disease that afflicts small children, right? what kind of life do they have? do they go to a regular school or a special school? do other children point, stare, taunt them? i think you should appeal to your audience's hearts as well as their minds.

(sometimes initial capital letter) any of the bodies politic which together make up a federal union, as in the United States of America. <br>  4. the body politic as organized for civil rule and government (distinguished from church ). <br>  <br>  With that being said, any country other then the US is considered a state.   <br>  <br>  Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Japan, Kuwait...   =)
Icoa7T2raa	Nope, but adding Fire I & II training would increase your salary down the road and open more opportunities. I would try to get into an EMT program as quickly as you can.  There are going to be some major changes with the way an EMT is trained, licensed, and recognized in 2010.  The National Registry is trying to get EMS workers more professional credit in the world of healthcare.  Many colleges require EMT students to take several prerequisites before a student can enter into the EMT-Basic program.  Paramedics will require a 2 year degree just to get into the program.  <br>  <br>  All this may sound bad, but it is not.  There is a high turnover rate in the EMS field and these steps are aimed at increasing the salaries and improving retention. Make sure you get and keep your National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians status current. That makes it easy to transfer you EMT license from state-to-state. A licensed EMT can also find a job!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ECphQqetaa	no. to be certified as an EMT you do not need any firefighting training.|`|rwZVtoYaaa	no, EMT and firefighting are both different. there are EMT firefighters, but that's different. it probably does matter which state. the best thing to do is look for the requirements in your state.|`|Inwfx0MAaa	its separate to be a emt im a firefighter with eca (first responder) and that class was difficult so i imagine emt is harder.|`|K0TgUvvDaa	no, its its own class, one semester, offered at most community colleges but its no joke, its a tough class

But lawmakers made the exceptions after bar owners and casino advocates said it would hurt business. Local communities could still pass tougher restrictions if they choose.<br>  <br>  Supporters say a strict ban would protect people from secondhand smoke and lower health costs.

He thought that she had afforded him all these luxuries so that he could be the perfect suitor for Estella.  Because of his dream he refused to associate with anyone he thought wasn't sophisicated or wealthy enough for his attention (what he is referencing about Joe).  When Pip discovers that his benefactor was in fact the common criminal, who he scared into helping, it shatters his dreams and disgusts him.  In this passage, he sees the criminal as a man who loved him for saving his life.  The criminal repaid him graciously for his help and Pip finally appreciates the generous act.  He sees past his exterior into his heart.

AA10572259	I think your idea is good but sounds like its too young for grade 10.  I was thinking of one the other day but now its totally slipped my mind.  I did science projects every year but my senior year and always got 1st place in school and then 1st in the county science fair too.  I enjoyed them a lot.  Though one year, I can't remember which I did something with ants and they all died but I faked the rest of the project and still won.  Okay off topic.  You could do something about plants and different types of fertilizers, like maybe one that is just the soil, two that are from the store and then some animal based ones.  I know could be nasty but interesting anyway.  I did a few growing mold, but after a while I think they said that you had to use cultures and couldn't actually grow mold on foods.  Mine were like the differences between types of mold on organic vs. non organic foods.  You could do something with greywater which is the water from sinks, dishwashes, bathtubs.  Its water that was used for washing but not from the toilet.  Maybe see if it could really be re-directed and used to water plants in your garden.  You could compare it to plants watered with rain water and regular tap water.  <br>  <br>  Another good idea is to look at projects from lower grade levels and see if there is a way to make that project more advanced.  If I think of anything else I will let you know.  Good luck.|`|4KRSUhXLaa	I'm in 5th grade, and a kid in my class did this. Trust me, it's not some kid retarded project.

h0ypk4Dtaa	Not a problem. Pre-med is an ambiguous major. It just means that you will take 4 specific classes. General chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and biology. Although some schools are beginning to require biochemistry, also.<br>  On top of those 4 classes, you need to earn your undergraduate degree. Many people go for a BS degree because they are already taking so many science classes. However, you can graduate with a BA degree as long as you fulfill the pre-requisites. The 4 pre-med classes can be finished within 2 years, and you typically apply to medical school 1 year before graduation. So depending on where you are in getting your degree, you could apply to medical school within a year. After the pre-req classes, you will need to take the MCAT (standardized medical school entrance exam).<br>  Talk to your guidance counselors about your classes to make sure that you are on track. Also talk to a medical school near to you and find out about shadowing a physician to see what it is like.<br>  Keep your grades up and do well on the MCAT. That will get your application on the committee desks. Then you need to have something that sets you apart, so keep your hobbies and get involved in community service. The admission committees want to see that you are a community-minded, well-rounded person who will make a positive impact on the healthcare community.<br>  Good luck!
AA11663288	I would say they have the same basic meaning, with slight differences in connotation.

zewYoUM4aa	I think he really cares about you, but doesn't want to get too attached to you before he is deployed. He wants to remain friends for now so that when he goes off he won't be too distracted. He might also feel it wouldn't be fair to you. It wouldn't be fair to be in a relationship with you while he is gone so that you are taken but aren't actually in a relationship because he isn't there. He wants you to have freedom while he is gone and not feel entirely committed to him. Anyways this is just my spectulations- I'd talk to him if you want a definite answer.|`|J0PTYGAmaa	i think its obvious that he does|`|Tp795k5taa	I am in the military and I broke up with my boyfriend while I was in training because it is so stressful that you need to be able to focus on what you are doing there. You can't be wondering in the back of your mind  if they are being faithful or not. You need to give him some time to let things settle and let him see if he thinks he can handle the deployment with out the stress of a girlfriend back home who may not be able to understand everything that is going on. A deployment is tough on everyone involved and he might just be trying to spare you the pain while he is away. Just keep talking to him and maybe let him know you are getting mixed feelings about the way things are. Tell him you care about him and that if he needs someone to talk to while he is gone you will always be there. People in the military need to know that the people they choose to be in their lives can and will support them in their decisions. They need to be able to understand that when Uncle Sam calls they have to answer. Even though I am in the military myself it is still very hard every time my husband gets called to go. Just let him know you can handle it.|`|rq6lNH4Iaa	I think that the response from Sunshine is ideal, but not so likely. He probably likes you a lot, but wants to keep his options open and not be tied down. For many people it is very difficult to stay loyal to a person at home with the distractions that come with traveling for months and years at a time. How long have you dated for? Did you used to express your love for each other? If it's less than six months and there was no sincere "I love you's" from both sides, then it seems very unlikely to me that he will want to stick with someone at home while he is off on adventures. If it is more than six months (somewhat arbitrary number) and there was lots of "love," involved, then there is a chance that he will want to stick with the person at home (you), but is again uncertain.<br>  <br>  As far as MySpace, he is probably just maintaining the status quo. MySpace and Facebook are the ultimate stocking devices and he knows that you're watching his every move on there (I have been in both situations, in which I can't help but watch another person's moves, and in which another person couldn't help but look at everything I did)|`|JV0i77uiaa	He seems to like you, however, be aware when he told he wants to be a friend for now.  You don't want to be friend with benefit.  Play a little hard to get.  Don't have any intimate relationship until you find out what his intention are.
8yE2sYGeaa	It could be a simile if not a metaphor|`|WrJBUNVqaa	i have no clue! but it is not a metaphor cause it doesnt compare two things.|`|rqn92vLIaa	No. I would not exactly call it metaphor, but it is a tricky one. It's not a metaphor as a metaphor literally uses another noun to describe a person, implying that the latter embodies all qualities of that noun. <br>  Eg: She is an angel. -->implies that the girl in question has all the <br>                                   qualities that an angel has (innocence, goodness)<br>        He is a lion at home. -->probably referring to the man's aggressive<br>                                           and fright-inducing tendencies, if you get<br>                                           what I mean.<br>  "Slay with a smile" fits the class of PERSONIFICATIONS better. Personifications are used to give a lifeless object a life-like quality. So in this case, the smile has no life of it's own but figuratively makes someone weak in his knees. Other examples of personifications are: "the trees danced in the wind" and "her shadow crept up on her" - to put it simply.

On the other hand, with a B.Com, you will have to spend more time studying and hunting for a job. <br>  I'm giving you a link where you would be able to find more about careers and scopes and importance of these degrees. <br>  best of luck!|`|lZa9R7IFaa	BBA is about management and done basically by students who wish to do management work in organisation, and is generally followed by MBA.<br>  <br>  B.Com is all about accounting, and hence followed by students who wishes to have career in accounting and finance field and later do studies in either CA / ICWA / CS / CFA etc., and also MBA (esp. MBA Finance).<br>  <br>  Comparatively, BBA limits your area to management side, while B.Com has wider options. And MBA can be followed by students from any stream, hence MBA is also an open option for B.Com, and as such MBA depends on the the fields of choice of students, regardless of graduation background.<br>  <br>  a brief on Commerce and its prospects with comparisions among courses is given in the below link -<br>  <br>  <a href="http://genwis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://genwis.com/</a><br>  <br>  So, you can choose according to your choice and as per the skills you possess.<br>  <br>  all the best !!!!|`|W8VaAxdJaa	hey buddy<br>  As You are completing your Final year exams...<br>  you should definately select B.B.A. for moving further in life...<br>  As if you compare B.B.A guys and B.com guys then there is a deep differences between the two of them as the guy who has done B.B.A seems more knowledgeble then B.com one...<br>  So i seem that you should go for B.B.A.. Also for your info.. I have also done BBA and look i am settle n happy with this step..<br>  So dont go for b.com n go for BBA...<br>  bye|`|QYXFai9Kaa	If you are VERY GOOD student willing to study in a highly competitive environment, you may consider joining BBA in a good USA school with a goal to be awarded a merit scholarship covering entire cost of your education.

Sozc3MyFaa	Simply, get the college catalog & see what's required for graduation as well as for pre-pharm major & enroll in the beginning classes.  We can only tell you non-specifics like you will need english, chemistry, etc.  The course catalog will tell you EXACTLY what classes to take (it will list them). Don't forget you need general ed classes as well.  Many people take those the first semester.
us0vbS6Jaa	I would change it to: In times of troubles, the government advocates that citizens should take on more responsibilities.<br>  The original sentence is perfectly acceptable however|`|PPwsaeUxaa	Yes. Advocate may use that followed by a clause. It may also be used with gerunds, as such:<br>  <br>  <br>  The Surgeon General advocates drinking plenty of water when you are sick.<br>  <br>  So you could say your sentence like this:<br>  <br>  The government advocates citizens taking on more responsibilities in troubled times. <br>  <br>  Advocate may also be use this way:<br>  <br>  We advocate the use of force in apprehending the criminal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :)|`|5qvWITGkaa	Yes, it is correct. However, the following is "more correct": The government advocates that citizens, in times of trouble, should take on more responsibilities.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	It's not incorrect, but it is formal.

yv1dRwF9aa	Haha well, one way is to wait until the last minute, then you will have little choice. I'm graduating from college in May and I have yet to find any enjoyment from writing. I've had some success by converting my anger into humor. I try not to become too cynical, but adding a little sarcasm to my writing seems to add some entertainment value for me. I've written an entire paper about how much I hate writing. Just start off slow, with an outline or something, and it will be much quicker to throw together.|`|K4FVyJuXaa	start on the paper the day it's given.  you dont' have to finish it, but just start it.<br>  <br>  add to it whenever you think of something relating to it, or when ideas come up along the way.<br>  <br>  Use this whole time to collect, organize and write out your thoughts into a draft<br>  <br>  upon your finishing touches, turn it in before the deadline.|`|zKsW2xtXaa	A while ago, I found out I was failing. Why? I was like you, I had no motivation to write a boring paper. But when I saw that F Packet, I was horrified and wished I could do this or that over again. But think about it, doing that paper could bring your grade up. Don't let things distract you. Imagine this, imagine your teacher reading your essay and loving it. Strive to be top of your class, strive to get that "A"! Telling my parents, "I got an A!" feels good! Nobody wants to say they got a C. You are the only one aware of the power within you. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Use it wisely ;)|`|R7PxCWAVaa	my sister is the same way! what she does is put on some of her fav. music and gets herself in a really good mood so that when she begins to write, she is no longer bummed out about the whole thing. hope that helped!

kDUWc9liaa	If its not on the test why read it ...correct?<br>  Look through notes and somewhat through those 100 pages and make your own study guide by writing down important things you need to know.<br>  (this isn't your first test Im guessing so you should know basically what the professor is going to put on the test.  If it is your first test for for this class I suggest using your best judgment on whats important and whats not..) Then after you finish the study guide study that and make note cards from index cards for the things you are having problems memorizing.<br>  Make sure you understand the concepts of the chapter though...because many questions aren't just Fact questions but comprehending and understanding questions...<br>  If its about anatomy and things look for things like pathways such as air pathways, blood pathways, etc...but if these aren't part of your 10 chapters don't worry about it.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S...Tomorrow? try not procrastinating next time...it will be a big help!

p37qSWkraa	Out of those schools, University of Chicago is definitely the most challenging academically. I'm afraid I don't know all that much about Loyola or University of Illinois at Chicago, but I've toured University of Chicago. It's very competitive and U.S. News and World Report ranked it 8th in the nation (Loyola is 116th, and University of Illinois Chicago isn't ranked). However, as for which is most likely to accept you, Loyola has the highest acceptance rate out of those schools and University of Chicago has the lowest. I'd said University of Illinois and Loyola would be sure bets for you, and you'd have a good shot (but not for sure) at University of Chicago.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|4gqogGlFaa	The best school would definitely be UofC but it's very hard to get into. I have heard from some people that they hate it because it is alot of work. I had 2 family members that went there and I went to a very good high school and still didn't get in. You just have to apply and wait to see if you get in but don't get so worked up about getting into your dream school because there are so many people applying and there's just so many a school can take. However, I got into UIC and Loyola. Loyola has a nice campus, it's right on the lake and they also have a downtown campus.|`|AA11123333	University of Chicago is the best school out of the 3.  Next is Loyola, and UIC is last.  <br>  U of C is more challenging and harder to get into.<br>  I think you could easily get in both UIC and Loyola.  UIC has a good med program though.

cBuYvBy2aa	I think that they do...sometimes.<br>  Say for instance, if your mother died and someone was talking about your mother in a bad way. That would hurt, right? Or like if your brother was a little person and someone was making fun of him. That would hurt emotionally versus if someone slapped you in the face. It'd hurt physically for a few minutes but then you'd get over it.<br>  <br>  Or maybe it's the other way around. I guess it just depends on what kind of person you are and how you take things.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	You mean you couldn't figure out that the answer to this question is "sometimes, and sometimes not"?<br>  <br>  How come?|`|yDnBqGheaa	Actions, because words can be empty promises.

zgTsCicNaa	How does the selection process work?<br>  There are several ways in which students are selected to participate in the NSLC. Teachers, counselors, and NSLC alumni nominate outstanding high school students from across the United States and around the world. Candidates may also be selected from one of several national talent identification surveys, including the College Board Student Search Service and the ACT EOS.<br>  Interested students who possess a strong academic record and have demonstrated leadership potential may also apply for admission to the NSLC on a merit basis.<br>  <br>  Applications are considered on a rolling basis. As programs fill quickly each year, students are encouraged to apply for admission at www.nslcleaders.org/enroll.html to speed the application process and help ensure first choice of session.<br>  <br>  Who is eligible to attend the NSLC?<br>  The NSLC seeks outstanding high school students from around the world who demonstrate academic excellence and leadership ability.<br>  Students must be attending 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th grade and maintaining at least a "B" average at the time of enrollment.<br>  <br>  ?
