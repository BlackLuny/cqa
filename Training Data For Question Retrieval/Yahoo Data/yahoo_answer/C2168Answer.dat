AA10302911	Balderdash is easy for anyone to reproduce with a decent dictionary. Just pick a list of obscure words, and have people make up definitions.  Then read all the definitions, including the correct one, and give everyone who guesses the right definition 2 points, plus give anyone whose definition fooled other people 1 point for each person who guesses it.  If people take turns being the one to read the answer, then you don't need to have a moderator.    Another game you could try is Apples to Apples.  Make some cards on green paper with adjectives and others on red paper with nouns (you will need about 10 nouns per adjective).  Players take turns being the judge, and on each turn the judge plays an adjective, and each player picks the noun that best matches that adjective.  Players put their nouns face down, and then the judge chooses the one he/she likes best.  Whoever played that noun card gets to keep the adjective card, and whoever collects a preset number of adjectives (a lower number the more players you have) wins the game.  I've played this with groups of anywhere from 4 to 20 people, and it honestly does get more fun the more players you have.  You can customize it by letting people write their own cards either before or after playing, and shuffling these into the red and green decks, so that the more often they play, the more relevance the game has to them.  I like this game fine right out of the box, but I once played a version in which the adjectives were straight out of the box but all the nouns were characters, props, or places from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which was hilarious with that particular crowd, but in your context, you can use things like "the cafeteria line," "that creaky reclining chair," etc.|`|3078cd70f433dfb3bb90750ecbb76adbaa	I can tell you this - don't use Twister!

You deal the entire deck out to each person playing. The goal is to be the first one with no cards.  Going in numerical order starting with Aces, the first person announces how many of that  card they are putting in the discard pile, truthfully or not. If another player knows or suspects that person isn't telling the truth that person says "Bullsh*t", if the person with the Aces is lying then they have to pick up the cards in the discard pile. If they are telling the truth the person who said "Bullsh*t" has to, the game continues on. If no one says it then the game continues on the 2s, then 3s, and so on and so on. It can really on be played with 4 or more people to make it really exciting! The more people that play the harder it is to tell whether the person is "Bullsh*tting!"

cd2afb7ad5ff34feaa7498d674b38c5faa	The offseason is where championships are built. It's where teams can make that one acquisition that puts them over the top. And while much is made over the signings of prospects at the Major League level, what's often overlooked in the world of videogames is the roster of producers and designers. The people who make the team that shape the face of the game.    In terms of baseball videogames, 2K Sports may have just made a Carlos Beltran-like signing.    Ben Brinkman, the lead gameplay designer from EA's MVP series has jumped teams, signing with Kush Games to help re-create, re-shape, and re-think the MLB 2K franchise, beginning with 2K7.    "When I was interviewing for the job at Kush to run the MLB 2K franchise, they asked me: 'What did you like about the game, what didn't you like about the game?' My answer was I liked most of the stuff you guys did, what I didn't like is that you guys only did it most of the way," Brinkman said with a laugh as he met with reporters before the recent Game 3, Twins/A's, Marco Scutaro (Oakland's answer to Mark Lemke) trademark performance. "I didn't feel like a lot of the stuff was done, polished, tuned the way it should be, and that was something that I look at, something that if you build the game properly, you have plenty of time to do that stuff at the end, and that's actually what we're doing now. For example, the precision pitching, cool idea, but it looked like it only got about 75% of the way there. There were about two or three little things they could've done which we're doing this year, and I won't get into too much detail, but it will take it into completion and make it a lot more fun and a lot more interactive."    Brinkman, like many baseball gamers, had his pet peeves about the 2K games. "One of them is the high hat (they all look like Fred McGriff), and the other is the batting. Guys would swing then completely slide and then start running. They'd be looking in left field when the ball was going to right fieldstuff like that."    Brinkman joined Kush in June and has already eliminated the McGriff clones and changed the batting animations, not to mention cleaning up the throws. "You would use the same throw everywhere. You would pick up the ball near the wall and you would use the same throw if you picked up or barehanded a ball and were throwing from third to first."    And like the transition Brinkman witnessed from the Triple Play franchise to MVP, he realized it was time to take a step back and not add features, but clean up the ones that are already there. Make the gameplay actually feel like you're playing a baseball simulation.    "We've gotten back down to bare basics. We're not adding a ton of bells and whistles this year, we're going to take what we have and add some cool stuff to it. We're also going to pull stuff out that takes away from the authenticity of the game. Showboat catches come to mind. Turbo baserunning. We're getting back to making a game that plays a really great game of baseball. It's what people want that play baseball games. Same for people who play football games or play basketball games. Look at 2K7 basketball, that's why people love it, it plays a real good game of basketball. Same with hockey. That's what we're trying to do. Those are our models. We're looking at those and seeing what they do, and it's simple stuff, play a good game of baseball."    The focus is finally back on the diamond.    "First year, drill down to the core and get the core baseball game going," Brinkman said. "Year two, add some cool features, maybe some tersely modes, maybe redesign franchise. The third year, just wrap it up into a nice bow and nail it. We hope to nail it every year, obviously, with everything we do, but we looked at High Heat, even going as far back as Baseball Stars. I play games, and I think that's a big difference that wasn't on the team last year. I play the game three, four hours a day. I sit there and if stuff isn't working, it gets fixed immediately. I was told last year that because of the hardware transition, they didn't get the game up and running until super late, so they never had a chance to play the game and work this stuff out. They got it running and then had a little bit of time to tune and bug fix and try to get it out the door. Fortunately, we've had the game running every day this year and as stuff is getting implemented, tune it and bug fix along the way to get to a point where we just hit Alpha a couple of weeks ago and now we can just tune and we can bug fix the items we need to fix. We're not adding a bunch of features after Alpha, that gets teams in trouble."    I asked Brinkman just how much of the game has been re-written from scratch and his answer was surprising.    "Gameplay, if you play the two side by side, it should be a dramatically different experience. We've added thousands of new animations. All new pitching, all new hitting, all new throwing, all new catching, all new tagging. The locomotion system last year that never really got tuned, we've spent a lot of time figuring out what was broken and what do we need to fix to get it playing and moving right. Different stuff that they did last year that was really cool stuff, let's harness it and make it play well. It's clich, and you've heard it a million times, but this is the next-gen baseball experience. All the stadiums redone, all the player models redone, faces redone. We've got accessories coming out our ***, no pun intended. Hats, all new hats, that was my one thing. We have to do hats. I'm tired of everyone wearing the same hat. So we'll have the crooked hat, the really firm bill, the sweat, the Derek Lowe sweat ring around the hat. Just little stuff like that. I don't want to get into it too much, but we really want to represent the game we're going to see today as closely and as authentically as possible.

Personally visit the place and you find varieties of requirements to you.
5b761b8d18486a083fcaf2c7fa0c309daa	I recently beat the game and I found that if you adjust your recipes by the demand that you can usually come out with out having to use the elephants      On the recipe screen it allows you to get the perfect combo of ingredients for a potion , but I made a note of the items that I use the most of and tried to overstock on those.    Like the fish heads , the itsy bitsy spiders, and the toadstools . the pixie dust is a common one as well.    Since u only get to use the elephants once its best to over stock the most common ones that way you dont need to use it. Also dont forget to adjust recipe, don't just buy ingrediants, by whats being demanded.

f6AsOyDbaa	To get a good answer, you need to have the instrument appraised by an expert.  Without knowing anything about the condition, it's really hard to say.  You could call the shop on the second label and see if they know anything about the instrument.  Honestly, original worth vs. sale value will probably not be too different for your average violin.    How much you should pay for a violin, used or new, completely depends on your level of experience, your purpose for playing (just learning vs. concert violinist) and your budget.  You can find decent violins for around $500, but a really nice one is going to run you at least closer to $1,000 and up from there.|`|AA10400832	http://www.violinist.com/blog/paulinefid...  http://www.givensviolins.com/audition/ti...

a7b64d0c0010d861a55cf40ec9776666aa	Well, first the easy part, where they come from. There are currently six sets of 'Tiered' Armor in the game. They are all gotten as drops from high level raids/instance bosses:    Pre-Burning Crusade drops (level 60 sets):  - Tier 1: Molten Core  - Tier 2: Hat from Onyxia; Pants from Ragnaros; the rest from Blackwing Lair  - Tier 3: Naxxramas    Burning Crusade drops (level 70 sets):  - Tier 4: Hat and Gloves in Karazhan; Legs and Shoulders from Gruul's Lair; Chest from Magtheridon  - Tier 5: Gloves, Legs, and Hat from Serpentshrine Cavern; Robe and Shoulders from The Eye  - Tier 6: Gloves and Hat from Mt. Hyjal; Shoulder, Legs, Robe from the Black Temple    For a lot of information about all the separate pieces for each class, check out:     http://www.wowwiki.com/Tiers    As far as whether or not they're better than PvP -- it's really a matter of preference. The PvP sets are, as makes sense, better for PvP. They give you a lot more health and resiliance than the Tier Armor sets do, and tend to reduce cooldowns and the like. They are great for making you able to take a lot of damage before dropping.    The Tier sets are PvE focused, so they aim at more balanced stats. They tend to have less stamina, but more other qualities.     So as to which is ultimately better -- depends on what you like, and what you tend to do the most. Do you have the most fun PvPing? Then work towards those sets. Do you like raiding instances? Start collecting your Tier sets.    Good luck.  =)|`|1cdsJ3lpaa	Raid armor sets are acquired from entering raid instances such as Karazhan - 10 man Serpentshrine-25 Magetheridon - 25 Man Black Temple - 25 Man. Currently gladiator sets are in between tier 5 to tier 6 to create balance between raid and pvp sets.|`|f24de72187c679e7bcd1a2d506c3ccc5aa	You get the sets by doing instances. :)  They are drops within.  Now for the rewards of them.  I believe that most of them are 'better' but it depends on what you are looking for.  I have a Tauren Hunter on Diskwood and I have two of the 60 PvP set and they work very well for me at the moment.  Although I am starting to go for the Tier 4 set for the Tauren. :)  Email if you want to go over more.  Cheers|`|xFmHltRWaa	the tier armor sets come from tokens that drop in high level raid dungeons    as for being better than pvp sets i'd say probably, however the tier sets have options open to multiple specs in classes.  for example there is a tier set that is geared towards a protection specced warrior or a dps specced warrior.  the set bonuses work for those certain classes.      the pvp sets are more geared towards pvp specific things like reducing cast times and cooldowns.    the gladiator set is a totally different animal, it is on par with tier 4 for armor rating and item bonuses.  still the set bonuses are more geared towards a pvp atmosphere.  not that big a deal if you are a dps class like a mage, warlock, or rogue but still no gladiator set for ultra-specific class specs like protection warrior or holy paladin
AA11749234	Sorry, I couldn't remember SIM City that clearly anymore. Too many years have passed so I might not be able to give a right answer, sorry...    I'm assuming that you have made yourself a nice, balanced city. It is a good thing to have a self-sustaining city but it also has its own drawback. The problem with such self-sustaining cities is that they halt advancement (for example : population growth) because they don't need anymore external input. An over-simplified example : if everyone is employed and every job has enough employee then it is not really that necessary to increase worker population anymore.    This is also a problem with another similar cities management games (for example : Caesar III)    To advance, you have to DISTURB that balance. Start by creating or bulding too many or too little of something. Off course, it take trial and errors to get it right, not too mention you'll have to fix any resulting disaster. But soon, it would pay off. You'll know what should be done.    With just the right nudge, your city would advance...    I hope this helps...

azZBZUwCaa	Argorok is easily one of my favorite bosses in this game.  True to form, he isn't that difficult, but he is fun.    After walking through the boss door, you find yourself  outside. (It'll take some Clawshot action to get up to him) Head  up to the top-most platform where the dragon awaits. You'll find  him plenty ready for you, flying around what looks like the arena  Cell constructed in DBZ. There are four huge towers flying  skyward on every corner of the arena... and even better, the wind  is howling. Notice that this platform is a giant rectangle, so  that two towers are very close to each other (relatively  speaking) at each end of the rectangle.    Use your double Clawshot to zigzag up the towers from one  side to the other, and when you get to the top turn to face the  dragon. The dragon will ready a huge stream of fire, so right  before he spits at you, attach yourself to the tower opposite of  where you are now. The fire will miss, and Argorok will need a  couple of moments to regain his strength. Aim and attach to his  tail with the Clawshot, then put on your iron boots. The added  weight will drag Argorok to the ground, where you can abuse him.  After doing this a couple of times, he'll throw a tantrum and  throw up a bunch of floating, spinning propellers that you can  latch onto with your Clawshot.    And latch on you will! Climb the towers again, and when you  get high enough, attach with your Clawshot to the first  propeller. Argorok will spit a stream of fire at you, so to keep  ahead of the flame, Clawshot as fast as you can from one  propeller to the next. Eventually Argorok will tire out and  you'll find yourself behind the boss. Target the weak spot on his  back and let yourself get pulled onto his back. Once on, press A  a few times to watch Link stab Argorok in the back with his  sword.    As a precautionary note, you have to do this twice, and the  second time around, the dragon tries to trick you. When you make  it to the propellers at the top and outrun the fire blast the  fire time, Argorok will immediately shoot a second burst of  flame, this time moving in the opposite direction  (counterclockwise) instead. After the second burst of flame you  may circle around Argorok and Clawshot to his back.    After the second time, Argorok goes down with a mighty roar  and is dead once and for all.|`|OIbBPz3Maa	i think you are talking about the one in the sky city right. well i dk but u have to climb the towers using the claw shot. and if its not htis one then i dk

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	It depends what animal you make, they start at $12 and go all the way up (not even sure how high they go). Accessories start at $3-$5, clothes start at $5 and go all the way up to $30+ for outfits. A koala for instance is $12, so is a small bear. A horse is $18. Prices vary by store, and animals vary by availability at each location. Best bet: buy the animal at Build A Bear, take it home naked, and buy the clothes on E-bay or at a craft store for a fraction of the price.|`|AA11808885	try buildthebear.com|`|Wz9Ybsy0aa	Go to www.buildabear.com Depends on which bear you choose, plus the clothes and accessories.

Good for a special treat, but a rarity for us!

Firstly, as a warrior you can make yourself healing potions, rage potions, potions of boost your stats etc. Secondly, selling both herbs and potions is a good way to make money. Thirdly, herbalism and alchemy are easy professions to "do" things in. While Burning Crusade has made all the crafting professions useful, all you have to do is look at the material list to know that it is still time consuming to make some of the more cooler stuff in the other professions.    However, you can always make simple but useful potions with minimum effort using herbalism and alchemy.

Riolus need happiness to evolve,otherwise it won't evolve at all. To make it happy, let it win battles and feed poffins to it.Or, you could have disrupted it's evolution.

En plus chez nous, la ps3 a t ampute de la plupart de ses fonctionnalits de rtrocompatibilit.    Amis europens bon matin !|`|5e57cc60b26e8d444cb4d34dbe2c8040aa	La PS3 vient de baisser de 100$ au US...  Pour le moment, et c'tait le projet de Sony initialement, une baisse du prix n'est pas prvue en Europe...  Mais bon, vu l'chec de la PS3 face aux autres consoles et  la baisse corrlative du prix de la nouvelle Xbox, je pense qu'ils ne vont pas pouvoir maintenir ce prix l trs longtemps...|`|Mo7EZzg4aa	mme si on me l'offrait, je la jterai aux chiottes moi la ps3!!|`|795068aec39f07958780a24ee6dcd08caa	Avec l'annonce de la baisse de prix aux Etats-Unis la semaine dernire, tout le monde s'attendait  ce que Sony allge le ticket de caisse de la Playstation 3 en Europe pendant l'E3. Mais le constructeur avait un autre plan. Un plan beaucoup plus con.    En guise de cadeau, Sony va finalement laisser sa PS3  600, mais garnir son pack d'une manette sans fil supplmentaire ainsi que de deux jeux : Resistance: Fall of Man et MotorStorm. L'opration commence ds aujourd'hui chez les revendeurs europens,  moins que vous ne prfriez attendre la sortie de la boite en carton officielle le 1er aout. Ou une "vraie" baisse de prix.      donc Sony prend bien les europens pour  des vaches  lait, ca ne fait aucun doute...

Or you can just check out the "What's new" section everyday. It gives you 50 points for the first time you check it out per day. Also, they used to have this game of chance that you could play but I'm not sure if it's still there or not.    Just check out the section in the top menu that says "Earn Credits". It lists all the ways to earn credits and gives you links.

0un1LkJCaa	i did not understand the question u asked but i will tell u some thing what i understood. i  know virtual villagers but after u complete ur trial version u have to buy the game for ever then u can play unlimited version so u can complete all the puzzles once the trial version is over u cannot do anything other than buying the unlimited version or u can download the trial version in different sites but u have the same time limit that is 30 min. May be in 30 min u cannot camplete all the puzzles so it is better to buy the unlimite dversion. hope this hels u.
fwnqB0dTaa	the reason you only get 30 minutes is because the site has to pay for it's upkeep.    That's why you pay for the code, and that is also why anyone giving you a code is breaking the law|`|0un1LkJCaa	for any game u have to buy after u play the trial version.  then u can buy the unlock version and u get a code then u type it u get the unlock version. hope this help u.
0un1LkJCaa	i think there is no activation code for the game talismania. when u complete the trial version of 30 min u can buy the unlimited version so that u can unlock the version and have a unlimited period. i think if u buy the unlimited version they give u a code so that u can type that code and play the unlimited version. hope this help u.

When you're in the neighborhood, (MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS WHEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD!!!)  type in :    boolprop TestingCheatsEnabled true    2.Enter Create A Sim.    3. hold the shift button as you type the letter N.  You should get a message telling you that you are now in "debug mode", which means you can get the alien skin, along with some sims University costumes. (don't ask.)      4. To leave "debug mode", just hold the shift button while you type the letter M.     Now, I found this out when I was making my characters name, (Nathan) and again when type=ing my other characters name, (Mylon). So I don't know if you have to do it when typing in the characters first name or not, but I'm assuming not.     Have fun! :)

vB5azkJNaa	Well...since there are 3 new games that are coming out [that are know...358/2 Days, Coded, & Birth By Sleep], the release date isn't guranteed yet...But I think KH3 is probably going to come out in 2 or 3 years [around 2010].    Why? Because, remember when KH1 came out...4 years later KH2 FINALLY came out in 2006.     I can't wait for all of the new KH games to come out! Especially 358/ 2 Days cuz it's about Roxas! :D|`|WsFMhGZlaa	I dont know when but I think somewhere near fall u can try looking at this fansite of kh  http://www.kingdomhearts3.net/|`|to82OuNdaa	i dont know if there is one but if there is i hope sooo... go check gamespot.com....|`|ttOFh0xPaa	Well, i know that it's coming out for ps3 for certain, but there have been rumours that there is going to be a kh3 for the Nintendo wii. But im not sure, you'll have to wait for a release date and then look into it. This all i know about the new games that are coming out (Birth by sleep, 358/2 days and coded) around this year to next year and then the big one, kingdom hearts 3. So here it is:    The game with the title 'Kingdom Hearts 3' will come out in 2-3 years, probably on Playstation 3. So no one nows the plot, characters or where it's set. But according to the ending on kingdom hearts 2, Kingdom Hearts 3 will be about Sora, Riku, and Kairi on Destiny Islands when they recieved the message from King Mickey.     There is also a rumor about the front cover of Kingdom Hearts 3. APPARENTLY it's going to be one of these:http://www.vgboxart.com/boxes/PS3/5530-v...  http://img154.imageshack.us/img154/4255/...    Whereas there are three more games comming out in the next year or so for mobile phones, psp and nintendo ds. All very different.    Right, the first one to be realised out of the three is a game for nintendo ds called 'Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days. (pronounced 358 over 2 days) This is all about Roxas's time in Organization xiii (WOO!!!) from when he gets his name to the begging of Kingdom Hearts 2. All the Organization xiii members will be playable (which are in numerical order: Xemnas, Xigbar, Xaldin, Vexen, Lexeus, Zexion, Siax, Axel, Demyx, Luxord, Marluxia, Larxene and Roxas.) aswell as Roxas. (main character) Also, there will be a fourteenth member joining (!) which is apparently a new female member. This will be realised this summer in JAPAN. the date estimated for the UK is around november-December. *sigh*  click here for a preview - http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zTrgAvyM6l...    The second one to be realised out of the three is for mobile phones. It's called Coded and It is set in the time of Kingdom Hearts 1. Sora is in his 'old' clothes. the plot is about Jimminy finding a misterious message in his journal, and he and Sora going out on a mission to find out what it's all about. The only playable character is Sora, but King Mickey is there as well. Donald and Goofy will not be joining you on this journy. *sniff* This will be realised around Autum in JAPAN. But i think that this one will stay in Japan, and no come to the UK or USA. click here for a preview - http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=I2fGLE3qrq...    And last but not least,the psp game which is being realised last out of the three. It's called Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep. It follows the keyblade war and the adventures of three heros by the names Ven, Aqua and Terra. This game id a bie of a mistery as the game takes place ten years before the first Kingdom Hearts. There is a character that looks ALOT like Roxas, but don't be fooled, as it is not him. Nobody actually knows the plot for this game-being the last to be realesed. This game will be realised around the end of december to spring in Japan. So aroun summer for the UK.  click here for a preview - http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=DsNEwm0Vp8...    I can't WAIT for these to come out!!!    I hope this was the information you were looking for!!     ~Larxene

It was worth it for me cause she rated the hotels, rides, attractions and gave directions to an Outlet that sold Disney souvenirs.      She wasn't selling tonight, but I noticed there were others.  One person was selling a CD for $20 about Disney World Discount Guide.     She wrote, "One family spent $7,500 for their Disney World vacation. The other spent $2,700.  What was the difference?  They read my guide." 170268684204

That is, you can't split the toons off one account and put them on another account. Before you get too bummed out about this, consider having your brother send you a Recruit A Friend invitation.     You can use that code to start your own WoW account, and while you and your brother play together in the same party (or you drag his toon around by double boxing) you will get 3x experience until you are 60th level, or three months have passed. You can also teleport each other to your location with a 1hr cool down.     Your brother also gets 1 free month of game time after you convert your RaF trial into a full account. He also gets a Zhevra mount after you pay for two months of game time on your new account.    You will level up fast, especially since you already know the game.

Other games do not, the rating is on the outside of the box and has a listing of the rating. If you want to make the system not be able to play it then you go in a use one of the presets for the game rating (family). To the best of my knowledge, or based on my experience COD WAW is the only game that I own that actually allows you to remove or decrease the level like this. Most other games do not have this option. Good luck, and hopefully you will find some games that are enjoyable and meet your rating requirement.    PS, if you don't like the language of the game, based on my experience I would suggest not even getting anywhere close to online as it only gets worse by the people you play against.

SFILhVYraa	dont get a 360 especially if u want live get a used or refubished from gamestop ps3 online internet is free both have good graphics  almost the same  |`|WyiOhCsjaa	1.The main difference is the hard drive: You don't get one with the arcade (it used to be called core), the 20gb is called a pro, I am pretty sure you have to buy the 60gb hd seperatley but that's because I haven't seen it in stores. The 120 gb is called an elite, and it also features a better, cooler, faster CPU, as does the Halo 3 special edition.    2. The pro is the basic "worth it" model. I have one, but I would like an elite now that they have the new chips. But, if you get one of the coolers that are like $10 in most places, there isn't really a huge difference.    3. The arcade is $199, the pro is $299, and the elite is $399. I haven't seen it cheaper than that anywhere, besides a used or refurbished one.     Basically, the arcade version is for people who just play little games, or do not want to game online, the pro is for people who want to game online, but not store alot of movies or music on their HD, and the elite is for someone who keeps alot of movies on their HD with the added benefit of the new chip.

i9uSn4CUaa	there is this store called build-a-bear. it allows you to have a fun experiance building the bear then, you can add anything you want like clothes accesorys, you can even get things to keep your bear in mint condition if you like. the bears are really neat and they are cheap too. price ranges vary between 10$ to 20$ but the 20$ are the rare bears and sometimes they have other animals like cats or bunny rabbits. when you have decided the bear/animal you like from the "unstuffed" section you want to bring it over to a stuffing machine where you can decide if you want a bear/animal sound placed inside your animal so when you press a sertian part of the bair then it says what YOU want it to say.(ex: the voice box may be placed inside the paw of the animal.) then you can add what you want like what clothes you want.

Isso evita um super-aquecimento do video-game, pois o PS2 Slim N?O tem cooler interno.     H vrios modelos diferentes de PS2 Slim e o seu deve ser um dos mais "antigos". O primeiro eles lan?aram com uma ventarola(um tipo de ventilador) pequena para ventilar. Depois com uma maior. At chegar a um modelo com duas ventarolas.  Esse ltimo  mais resistente e esquenta menos, mas mesmo assim  bom n?o jogar por muito tempo seguido.  Verifique qual  o seu modelo, se n?o for esse ltimo ent?o  normal esquentar tanto. Ent?o o jeito  jogar um pouco e deixar esfriar pra que n?o queime. Fazer o que.  no meu eu coloquei um ventiladorsinho e eu jogo o tempo q eu quiser nuca deu problema  Realmente o ps2 slim ele queima mas facil do que seu antecessor aquele grand?o isso se d devido o grand?o possuir um sistema de ventila??o ao contrrio do slim que n?o possui, por isso recomenda-se n?o jogar mais de 3 horas consecutivas no slim, e  por isso que as locadoras preferm o grand?o afinal ele  mais resistente e nessas locadoras passam vrias horas ligados.|`|rqwFVBpIaa	A minha ainda n?o queimou! :p    Jogos: Black, Pes2009, motoGP 4, Gran Turism 4, Resident Evil 4, Gof of war 1 e 2,......................|`|PZn5w6Adaa	Cara ja tive u m,caixotao e um slim eu era viciadasso nisso mas resolvi parar de jogar nao por enjoar mas pra acbar com o vicio!!!

JxDyEY4Aaa	Estes s?o os meus preferidos    Aventura e/ou ac??o    God of war 1 e 2. O 2  o meu jogo preferido de sempre.  Ico - aventura sublime. Jogo excepcional que passou ao lado do xito. Obra de arte autntica. Genial.  Extermination - outro jogo pouco divulgado, que merecia maior sucesso.  Gta, todos eles. O melhor  jog-los por ordem: gta3, gta vice city e gta san andreas.  Devil may cry 1 e 3.   Onimusha 2 e 3.  Max payne 1 e 2 - pena os grficos deixarem algo a desejar e haver slowdowns.  melhor jog - los em pc.  Resident evil 4. Muito bom, renovou completamente a srie.  Resident evil code veronica.  Baldurs gate dark aliance 1 e 2. rpg de ac??o para todos os pblicos.  Soul reaver 2. Aventura gtica de grande qualidade.  Metal gear solid 2 e 3.  Prince of persia , todos. Original, muito bem conseguido. Aqui e acol algo dificil.  Serious sam next encounter - fps superdivertido.  Splinter cell, todos. Espionagem pura, sem nunca ser chato.  Tomb raider legend e aniversrio.  Primal - aventura  la tomb raider.  Headhunter.    Desporto    Pro evolution soccer, principalmente o pes 4, 5 e 6. Melhor jogo no 1x1  Gran turismo 3 e 4. Os nicos jogos de condu??o que realmente valem a pena.  Fight night. Detesto boxe, mas gosto muito deste jogo.  Ready to rumble 2. Boxe outra vez, muito divertido.  Virtua tenis 2 e 3. Segundo melhor jogo no multiplayer a seguir ao pes.  Burnout, do 3 em diante.  Nhl da EA, qualquer um.    Plataformas     Ratchet and Clank, todos. O primeiro  o menos conseguido.   I - ninja - plataformas do estilo do ratchet. Pouco conhecido mas bom.  Jack and daxter 1 e 3. Bons mas difceis. O 2 N?O, por ser demasiado frustrante.  Pitfall lost expedition    Outros    Soul calibur 2 - muito melhor que os tekken e dead or alive.  Crazy taxi - divertimento puro, embora curto.|`|7dbce6da70fe92dadd37d6fb25f6bad7aa	de corrida reealmente a srie need for speed  imbativel o melhorna minha opini?o o underground o 2;agora aventura god of war;pitifal muito bom tbm;colossus pelografico e jogabilidade e at indicaria o     devil may cry mais estou oferecendo o que agrada de forma     geral ;outro o Resident Evil 4 muito bom jogo ;esportes ai depende eu     gosto muito do Voley (pois  dificil)e fora o futebol  mesmo o     melhor ;este video game ainda conta com excelentesjogos de terror com bastante a??o e jogabilidade otima (ai esqueci o hitman muito bom tbm)silente hill;fatal framee obscure"!    abra?os!|`|slaFtNriaa	Ba tm muitos como   punisher,50cent butletproof,castelvani,ultiment alian?a mutant,resident, motoqeiro fantasma,,beach volley ball;nba live 07,king of fighters,need for speed carbon....  voce tem que acha um estilo que voce mais goste.vai testando ai|`|kN7KF8XFaa	Need for speed undergroun ou pro stret  Senhor dos neis  devil my cry 1,2,3 e o 4  e pesquise na google tb jogos pe play station 2  vai achar varios|`|vNVxjRTuaa	resident evil 4  god of war 1 e 2  midnights club 3 dud edition remix  def jam fight for ny  etc  para muito mais va em www.baixakijogos.com.br    por favor coloca como melhor resposta|`|cWSlgYNeaa	te aconselho o residente evil ; piratas do caribe .gran turismo gta san andreas. jogos praticamente perfeitos para ps2.|`|Zq0NGlnGaa	De corrida tem o Need for Speed, Drive, Gran Turismo que s?o timos.

An 11 year old is going to want to play games, they are not going to want or need a laptop.  While you can play video games on a laptop, it is no where near the quality and quantity of games that are availible for the xbox 360.     You can also get an xbox 360 for much cheaper than a gaming laptop, and an 11 year old would still be happier with an xbox 360.      And yes, the xbox is internet ready out of the box, as long as you have high speed internet such as DSL or Cable.

If not, X Box 360. Computers are sometimes complicated and frankly, they have potential to be unsafe for children. You have to be very careful as to what your child does on it.    As for X Box, that seems more what a child would be into. It's simple, straightforward play and I can imagine that would be more enjoyable for a child. Online will cost you extra, You should look into X Box Live, which is the online (internet) service. Regardless of this, you won't be able to actually browse the internet (as far as I know) with the X Box the way you can with a laptop. I know Wii can, as it has an internet channel, but X Box 360 I'm not sure about.

fbbed5b7bd7dd4a791277a234313a93daa	he is very hard to defeat.  I tried this and it woked.  I used the drive forms. But don't use wisdom. Wisdom dosn't do that much damage.  when Demyx says " Dance, water dance" you have to defeat 10 of his clones in 10 sconds. Demyx says it twice. The first time he says it i think you have to defeat 50 clones in 40 second and the second time you have to defeat 10 clones in 10 seconds. And the best thing is to use is your reacion and drive forms. Don't waste your drive form. listen to dance water dance then use them.  When he said " come on. kick to the beat" alot of geysers apear around him and he runs towards you which if you don't watch out you can die. When demyx says "water"  he unleashes a blast of rain that can hurt you.  The battle is almost over once you defeat 10 clones in 10 second. After you defeat the clones attack him more times and the battle is over.|`|AA12308686	I HATE that battle.    My best advice is to spam the triangle button and use donald's limit breaks when you're fighting the clones and heal yourself when you're not under a time limit.    If you're a mage type you could try thunder magic, it SHOULD work pretty well on water enemies.    If you get really desperate, you could try swearing at the PS2, that ironically enough usually helps me when I'm stuck on something.|`|AA10891563	combos combos  make sure you have the donald auto limit break ready  that is the best limit to use against him, you will stop him from attacking you, and the limit has the best combo for that time.The hardest part of this battle is|  |trying to defeat all of the water clones|  |in time. The Reaction Command can either|  |be really useful or very bad. After|  |getting rid of the clones, Lock-On to Demyx|  |and start hacking away. When he does the|  |girly chuckle of his, make sure to|  |get out of his path. Again, the|  |hardest part of this battle are the water||`|AA12260442	Try to be on level 30 or higher.He still has his water people.Keep whacking.Try to use reaction commands.Use master form.It's the best form.Try your best attacks.Soon he will fall.I thought he was hard too.

c571700abb3725af4b2421e0d285c271aa	Use drive glitch... that would be when the drive limit is full then you drive, run back to a save before the drive runs out and level the world, reenter and it will be full.     Valor (get it automatically) - is number of hits, the more you hit something the more exp it gets... bosses are great, also equipt you lowest damaging keyblade... like the honey pot.    Wisdom(get it automatically) - kill heartless, first board of the world that never was... bunch of weak heartless.    Master (get that automatically) - drive orbs.... goto land of dragons where the town is, go through and kill all the enemies up the mountain (first stage where the covered wagon are.) drive and use the drive glitch running back and forth destroying those carts, when drive gets to almost one run back to save then exit, reenter and the gauge should be refilled.     Final (fight xemnas after the event memory skyscraper and before entering the last stage, when you attempt to drive final form should be there to select, or it may happen after you defeat him... i got mine automatically when i activated the drive, it happens at random but once you get it then i becoems selectable. this is near the end right before you go into kingdom hearts called memory skyscraper.) - Kill nobodies, the best place i found is the land that never was.    Beyond that if you ever run out of drive energy just goto the collisum and enter a cup like pain and panic, you dont have to finish that cup... just exit out. Also be careful while drive boosting, make sure you have final form or you will turn into the anti form often. When you repeatedly go anti-form just use the final a couple of times to decrease the anti-form percentage.|`|AA10891563	depends on what drive  if it is valor and wisdom you need to kill a certain amount of heartless if it is Master you need to collect a certain amount of yellow orbs and if it is Final you need to kill the nobodies|`|4a3864f7acf1277e3a348e7abf2fc5ebaa	It happens automatically, just keep playin through the story.

AA10891563	this is from personal experience  equip auto limit on fantisa for donlad  also equip one more chance so that if you are about to die you still have one hp left, that gives you time to heal.  you'll begin by being sniped, use the warp snipe reaction command to defeat this and get him down  then keep on pulling off combos on him, that is the important thing  the fields will constantly change. you want the field to change to a striaght long field, that run up to him and when you get close to him use the limit that i asked you to equip earlier.  keep on bashing him and using the reaction commands. he will increase his speed and soon you will enter a field where he shoots in a circle and showers his bullets at you, jump over when he shoots in a circle and run around when he tries to shower his bullets at you. once he is at his last health bar, use any drive form and kill him.  i used healing magic and potions, no need to use exlirs in this battle     equip once more and second chance on yourself if you have either of them|`|AA11702708	lvl 52 and have reflect on short cut, and be ready with items save you magic for reflect.

Try equiping some Lucky Lucky abilities, this improves your odds of getting items from enemies. There are a total of 7 Lucky Lucky's that you can get. 3 are learned abilities (One for Sora, One for Donald, and One for Goofy), 3 are bestowed on weapons ( Sweet Memories Keyblade [obtained in 100 Acre Wood, after completing Spooky Cave mission], Meteor Staff [found in a chest when the Interceptor crashes in Port Royal], and Genji Shield [obtained by completeing the Titan Cup in Olympus Coliseum]) and 1 on an accessory (Lucky Ring [obtained by completeing the Pain and Panic cup in Olympus Coliseum]) With all these equipped, your chances of obtaining items increases, but it isnt guaranteed that everytime you defeat one, you'll get an item, just keep trying.|`|AA10891563	Air Pirates are located at the base camp in Mulan's World|`|c9c94bc1bb9f2e4b29808869aba63ac6aa	he is rite the guy b4 me listen to him i ask and he help me like every time i pass the levels i needed|`|edc0a189f4f52486e5a95e9775caaaeeaa	Okay, stay with me here.  This is going to be a bit long-winded.  Equip the lucky ring and the Sweet Memories Keyblade from the 100 Acre Wood to Sora, the Meteor Staff to Donald from Port Royal, and the Genji Shield to Goofy from the Titan Cup.  Also equip the Lucky Lucky ability to everyone.  Now go back to The Land of Dragons and enter the cave where you found Shan-Yu(near the village).  In there are about three Air Pirates and they are ready and willing to fall to your Keyblade and give up one or two Dark Crystals.  If you do not get them right away, do not fret: simply jump back into the Gummi Ship and land right back to the save point almost directly in front of the cave.  I hope this helps!

AA12364032	OMG i would love to answer this Q Ok Kingdom Hearts 1 is the frist game of the series it starts off with a young boy named sora and his friends Riku & Kairi they live on an island and they wounder why they are here and they go to new worlds and something big happens to there raft and there island sora wakes up and riku and Kairi are gone later on sora gets the wepon the keybade and he gose along with donald and goofy to fight the heartsless the bad guys and the story has twist and turns and its realy cool wont tell the rest Kingdom hearts 2 is about them agin and new enimies called nobodies and sora is a teen now and lokks much cooler and it is sooooo much bedder than the frist but Kingdom hearts 2 is like $50 and kingdom hearts 1 is like $20|`|89224a130c4bb9046756628410c5c45daa	Well its about a boy named Sora who is chosen to be the keyblade wielder. The heartless and nobodies are most of the villains. They are created when a humans heart is spilt ad the dark takes over. The heartless is created from the darkness and the nobodies are the empty shell that is left behind. The story of these two game =s are too complex to be explained easily so I suggest to go to wikipedia or play the games yourself.|`|1780c717e6890d3b0c210a04c519d697aa	They are about 40 hours of time you will need to finish them. LOL|`|AA10891563	Kingdom Hearts begins on the lush, tropical islands called "Destiny Islands", home to the main characters Sora, Riku, and Kairi. The trio wish to leave the islands that they have been confined to all their lives, so they build a raft to escape. The night before their planned voyage a storm sweeps through the island, and evil shadow-creatures called the Heartless appear. The three friends are separated. When Sora finds Riku surrounded by darkness, Riku disappears and Sora has to fight the Heartless. After the battle, Sora receives his weapon, the mystical Keyblade, and sets out to defeat the Heartless and reunite with his friends.    in kingdom hearts 2    Kingdom Hearts II begins where Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories left off. Sora and his companions have been asleep for about a year, regaining their memories. When Sora awakens, he eventually arrives in Twilight Town, the place where a mysterious boy, Roxas, lived before he left suddenly. Gaining new clothes and powers, Sora began his journey anew, unaware of the events that have taken place in Chain of Memories. Sora continues his quest by unlocking paths to new worlds, fighting the Heartless and Nobodies, as well as facing the remaining members of the mysterious Organization XIII. As the game progresses, Sora learns how much he and Roxas have in common

I will tell you the MASTER secret to beating him.  you MUST have both of these 2 things.     1) you have to have at the very least 5 elixars, when he uses his heartless angel on you, you'll be glad you did.    2) this is the secret one.  you also have to have reflectaga.  when he starts his main combo on the ground, right before he hits you use reflectaga from the shortcut menu and use it in succession 3 times (counting the first).  after he stops and you stop, just sit back and watch the damage fly.|`|AA12144055	Hm...try leveling up a little more maybe to level 75 and try again.  Sephiroth in KMH2 is MUCH harder than he is in the first game.  Good luck.

The person you will need them the most for is Sora.  I'm really far into the game and Ive beaten Sephiroth, and the entire time i only EVER used AP boosts on Sora. Yet, still, i don't have enough AP for all of his moves, and i have over 100 AP.  Definitely give them to sora, Goofy and donald aren't as powerful in this game as in all the others.  Goofy only becomes noticeably strong when he gets his final weapon.|`|AA10752736	the ap boost is permenate. and i always use it on the person who needs more abillitys for themself. most of the time i use it for sora|`|AA12167422	AP boosts increase your ability points, yes they are permanent...and you should use a majority of them on Sora and Goofy...Donald isn't really important in this one...
c05230c38b6213fa197e4b831dba9851aa	The poster duty minigame is SUPER tough.  I completed it by going to youtube and just doing exactly what somebody else did to get it under 30 seconds.  Dont forget-you need all your drives MAXED before you can do it (or at least it makes it MUCH easier)  So first max your drives, then imitate what somebody did on youtube.  (just search poster duty)  Here is a video of somebody:  http://youtube.com/watch?v=XPqvnZOEsfs&s...  With practice, it is doable.  Good Luck! EDIT:  Watching a video is alot easier than somebdoy explaining it in words, thats why i gave a link to the video.  (in case you were wondering)|`|AA10891563	yes, just max out( or level 9 ) on all your drives  you will gain the abilities of super jump, arieal dodge, quick run and glide  these are the ablites you will need to make poster duty much faster

(edit: that may just be for Kingdom Hearts 2, I don't remember if thats how it works on Kingdom Hearts 1.  Scratch removal may probably your best option if there are any more problems with the game.  Some video stores have a scratch removal machine that does a pretty good job at removing scratches.  If that doesnt work then you are probably out of luck.

Aber ich kenne das mit meinen 9j?hrigen Zwillingen, wenn ich mit denen auf die Kirmes gehe, sind 100 nichts. Wir haben durch Zufall erfahren, das Geburtstagskinder egal welches Alter in vielen Freizeitparks freien Eintritt haben. Wie schon gesagt, ich habe Zwillinge und mein Mann haben alle drei am gleichen Tag Geburtstag, wo sich das wirklich auch lohnt, sodas nur ich den vollen Eintritt zahlen muss.  Man muss ja auch bedenken, so ein Park verschlingt ja auch Unsummen um zu bestehen, ich kann das schon manchmal nachvollziehen. Andersrum kann ich mich nicht dran erinnern, im Freizeitpark jemals ber 50DM bezahlt zu haben.   Aber immer noch gnstiger als auf eine gro?e Kirmes zu gehen.  Einmal Wasserbahn kostet auf der Palmkirmes pro Person 6,00. Bei vier Personen schon 24,00, fast einmal Eintritt. Und man geht doch auch nicht jedes Wochenende in einen Freizeitpark.

Du wirst doch nicht wirklich hier dein Vorhaben ?ffentlich machen wollen???    Beim Roulette habe ich allerdings gelesen soll es m?glich sein die Zahlen vorher zu bestimmen. Vor einigen Jahren kam in Bericht im Spiegel, ber einen Prozess gegen einen Spieler, der mit einem Gel?ndewagen in das Casino Baden-Baden gerauscht ist.    Der Spieler wurde letztendlich nur sehr milde bestraft wegen "Fahrens ohne Fhrerschein - nicht auf ?ffentlichen Strassen - sondern auf Privat Gel?nde.."    Das Casino verzichtete auf Schadenersatz, weil der Angeklagte im Gerichtssaal einen Roulette Tisch aufstellen liess und unter richterlicher Aufsicht vom Staatsanwalt gewnschte Zahlen erspielte.    Es soll mit einem so genannten "Zielwurf" funktioniert haben.    Also vielleicht bevor man setzt ein paar Jetons "pour le personal"....    Viel Glck dabei    Bea

Die H?lfte der Teilnehmer hat alkoholfreie Getr?nke die andere H?lfte alkoholhaltige Getr?nke bekommen. Alle Getr?nke hatten jedoch den gleichen Aufdruck und Geschmack und alle wurden als alkoholhaltige Getr?nke verkauft.  Das Ergebnis: Alle wurden besoffen.  Es ist wohl so, dass die Psyche da eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Wenn du denkst dass du alkohol trinkst, dann wirst du auch besoffen. Einfach weil dein gehirn denkt du wrdest welchen trinken und dann auf den Zustand, den es in dieser Situation kennt umstellt. Ich k?nnte mir vorstellen, dass es sich ?hnlich auf einer Party verh?lt. Man ist es gewohnt auf Partys Alkohol  zu trinken und deswegen wird man besoffen. Wenn du jetzt auf eine Party gehst und keinen trinkst, dann erkennt dein gehirn dennoch die Situation als Party, verbindet sie mit Alkohol und l?sst dich besoffen werden.  Ein weiterer Grund k?nnte sein, dass du dich auf deine Mitmenschen einstellst, und weil die besoffen sind und es ansonsten ziehmlich anstrengend und langweilig fr dich w?hre schtzt du dich quasi selber und spielst dir vor auch besoffen zu sein.  Ich hoffe dann nurmal, dass du dir am n?chsten Morgen nicht auch vorspielst einen Kater zu haben ;-)|`|0a84cf83fc0d2003907ca8d0778f4d56aa	Das liegt an der Musik, den Lichtern, der bermdung.

Aus eigener Erfahrung kann ich sagen, dass auch allein dieses allgemeine Verhalten, wenn alle betrunken sind plus die berm??igen Sinneseindrcke reichen, um mich pers?nlich betddelt zu machen. Da ich keinen Alkohol trinke, kann es, zumindest bei mir, nicht dieses Erinnern an vorherige Zust?nde sein. Vielmehr sind es die Einflsse, die sonst noch wirken.

36579647ad286946325afd56ea213ae1aa	"There is a legend that, "either George Hansburg or a anonymous German was traveling through Burma when he meet a poor farmer with a daughter named Pogo. Pogo wanted to go to temple every day to pray, but couldn't because she had no shoes to wear for the long walk through the mud and rocks. So the poor farmer built a jumping stick for her, and when George Hansburg or the anonymous German returned home, he made and sold a similar jumping stick of his own."     Yes, the above story is just a legend and not true, however, George Hansburg did patent the first pogo stick in 1919.    A boatload of wooden pogo sticks were exported from Germany to the US based Gimble Brothers Department Store in 1919. However, the wooden sticks somehow rotted and warped during the journey. That same year, Gimble asked George Hansburg, an Illinois baby furniture and toy designer, to improve the design of the wooden pogo sticks. Hansburg created a painted all metal, enclosed-spring pogo stick, and manufactured them in an Elmhurst, N.Y. factory.     In an effort to promote pogo sticks, George Hansburg taught the Ziegfeld Follies girls how to pogo. In 1920, Ziegfeld featured a marriage performed on pogo sticks. The roaring twenties proved to be the height of popularity for pogo sticks and all kinds of pogo stick stunts and publicity tricks occurred.    In 1947, George Hansburg invented the Master Pogo, an improved steel pogo stick with a longer-lasting spring."|`|f89a587bcc67f03594b0230198e3729faa	It was invented by Joe Hopkins in 1720s|`|0390637e103bce15bc2599b4d0b8f810aa	SBI Enterprises, located in Ellenville, NY, is the original inventor of the Pogo Stick.  n|`|bff15dcdf2900a8af41410c897fd01a1aa	Good question.

54be9b6526936cef554d9a764ff83efcaa	To raise your health you have to feed your person a healthy diet consisting of all 5 food groups every day. The 5 groups on Mills are protein, grain, dairy, vegetable and fruit.    I use two different diets to keep up my health and my health on all my accounts is at 100%.    Diet  1:  If your hunger level is grumbly or 'lower' eat the following:  1. Fruit Salad  2. Green Salad  3. Cheeseburger    If you are still not 'completely full' after eating those three items try adding another salad or fruit salad.    Diet  2:  If your hunger level is comfortably full or higher.  1. Lasagna (found on page 2 of the deli section of the grocery store)  2. Fruit Salad    Then if I'm still not "completely full" I supplement with the cereal from Chip's Grabbing machine.    You can also groom to raise your health 1 point per day. Put one of the toiletry items in your house (i.e. a hairbrush) and click on it. On the menu that pops up in the lower left hand corner you will see a 'groom' option. Click that and it will pop up a window that says grooming contributes to good health and it will raise your health 1 point. It can be done only once per day.     If you eat this diet every day you should see your health rise. It will rise more quickly if it is low (in the 20s for example) than it does when it is high (in the 80s for example) but it will eventually reach 100%.    I've done some testing on the idea that drinking water or changing your clothing raises your health level, but I've found that it has no impact whatsoever.|`|ec98d07bfe5bfe255a0b28efc34464ccaa	buy healthy foodz at da grocery store|`|61067fedf264463ca62586a8d1d24170aa	Go to the store and buy something to eat.
