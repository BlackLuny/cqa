m1cEbzBcaa	tons of them around LA    honestly as many recommend... don't waist the money... for the $500-800 that it usually costs for these "schools" you can stock up your bar, buy a $5 book, and host some great parties.  you will get experience, learn what people in your area are ordering, and maby get some more friends!    much better than a piece of paper that most bars don't care about.
FxWppY7Baa	Yes unless they are organic.     Many people who buy pastured eggs cook most everything they eat and do not buy many processed food products such as mayo, cookies, etc., as there are a lot more horrible industrial ingredients in processed food than just the eggs from factory farmed hens. There is high fructose corn syrup chocked full of mercury, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc..|`|XHnpraaxaa	If they have a product that had Free Range Eggs in it it would say it was Organic or say it had these kinds in it or other wise it would be the regular kind of eggs.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	They most likely are made with battery farmed eggs.|`|YdjX5fOWaa	I'm not sure if vain is the word you wanted to use there.

Palmin is the same as Copha, except there are two varieties: one comes in a tub, which is almost spreadable, and the other comes in a block like Copha.    The blocks come in 250g (1/2 pound) portions. Available in many European delicatessens in North America.    Substitutes  Coconut butter or 2 parts shortening or lard, with 1 part creamed coconut.

After proper sanitation it should be fine to use again, unless you notice serious discolouration permanently left on the pot (like really bad oxidization of the metal or rust).|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	Scrape the rice out into the garbage.

Blend it all together.|`|2vkVQ3F6aa	I don't feel you ever need a recipe for something like this...    Throw some ice in the blender (fill it up), add your milk, yogurt, and strawberries.  Add honey to taste, but you won't need it if your strawberries are already sweetened    You can also substitute any juice instead of the milk, and add any other fruit you have around to add taste or nutritional value.    There is a Mexican smoothie ("liquado") that is simply tons of ice, milk, and strawberries blended... topped with a little whipped cream and cinnamon.  You can never go wrong, and it's whipped and smooth and creamy.
y32e7AoRaa	I found it on this review site  http://newherbalremedies.com/acai.html    where its rated pretty high. Been taking it for a week and I feel like it gives me a boost. Looking forward to weighing myself tomorrow.|`|eksHt5jnaa	They claim that you will "lose weight, and reverse the effects of aging".    Basically the active ingredient is caffeine.  The only real benefit may be the antioxidants, but you can find just as much in other fruits such as blueberries.  I think acai is only appealing because it is unfamiliar to most people in North America and Europe.
O2GRn8oOaa	for  1  homemade is the best     2  no it wont be a carrot cake without carrots but i dont like raisins in mine       3 no olive oil has a certain taste and it would taste nasty|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I've heard that the Decadent one was the very best, and haven't heard bad reviews about any smells.  If the raisins are in there separately, toss them in a little bag with some flour, to coat them, and they won't sink (or just add extras).  Don't use olive oil, unless you want to have a slight olive flavor to the cake.....  Sorry I'm not a better help:)  I've always made them from scratch|`|2TEDmxPXaa	I use that particular one myself and i like it..... but i do change what gets added a little bit.     For instance if it calls for 1/4cup  oil, what i do instead is use at least half a cup of margrine and lessen the water added just a smidge (you lessen the water cause margrine is whipped up oil n water basicly)...and as a matter of fact i use milk not water....    and what you do so that the raisins dont all sink to the bottom is....coat them throughly in flour first...before you add them to (the already mixed) batter...this way they stay suspended....its the same for all cakes with fruit in them...they have to be throughly mixed/coated in flour first.    and no @ using olive oil....it tends to burn and your cake will most likely be scorced on the bottom....to make sure that never happens...line your cake pan with paper....doesnt have to be a special parchement...you can use brown paper bags if you have it....coat it in oil.....then pour your batter....never sticks...and the paper just peels right off when you tip it out|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	Make it like this...

This is because the tylenol and alcohol are processed in the body through the liver, so having both of them in your system taxes your liver.    I would send juice boxes, coffee (though it doesn't cure a hangover), and junk foods. Put all that in a mini trash can and you can write inside the bottom (puke here!) or something.
cGYJq3Udaa	There are many different ways to make meatloaf.  Here is an easy basic recipe.    1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef  1 cup bread crumbs  1 egg  1/2 cup ketchup   1teaspoon mustard   1/2 onion---chopped small   1/2 teaspoon salt  1/4 teaspoon black pepper    Heat oven to 350.   Mix all the ingredients in a  bowl.  Squish it all together with your hands until thoroughly blended. Pack into a  9x5x3-inch loaf pan and bake for 45 min-1 hour at 350 degrees.     About 15 minutes before the meat loaf is done you may like to spread about 1/2 c of ketchup over it.  I often add some brown sugar to the top sauce.     You may also like to use BBQ sauce either in the meatloaf or on top.  Some people grate or chop chunks of cheddar cheese in it.    You may like to put green chiles or chili power in.    Be creative!!!  Enjoy!!|`|pP7iRc2Daa	Easy and quick;Mix 90% ground beef with 10% ground pork, add some herbs and or spices.

I get a lb. or so of ground beef or ground chuck, mix in two slices of fresh grated bread, an egg, a little mustard, a little catchup, some grated onion and shredded green pepper. I form a loaf out of it and cook it at 350 for about 45 minutes in a casserole dish. When it's almost done I pour some good tomato sauce on it. Even spaghetti sauce works well. Some people like a non-saucy meatloaf, but I love it really juicy with lots of sauce. I make mashed potatoes to go with it. My bf loves to pour the sauce all over the potatoes.|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	EASY ITALIAN MEATLOAF       2 1/2 lbs ground beef or chuck  2 large peppers, red or green, coarsely chopped  1 16 oz can diced tomatoes  1 large sweet onion, chopped  4 slices bacon  1 1/2 cups Italian breadcrumbs  1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  2 tablespoons minced or pressed garlic  1/2 teaspoon basil  1/3 teaspoon oregano  1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley (do not substitute)  1 teaspoon seasoned salt or beef bouillon powder  2 eggs  1/3 teaspoon ground black pepper  1/3 cup ketchup (or more as needed)  onion and garlic powder to taste    Preheat oven to 375F.

Baste occasionally with additional ketchup during cooking, being careful not to allow oven to get cold or additional cooking time will be required. If desired, cover with thinly sliced onions.

Be sure the pan has high edges.      Bake for 30-45 min outside should be brown and inside should be cooked through.

They put that poison in most gums and mints as well.    Aspartame is an addictive excitoneurotoxic carcinogenic drug that interacts with virtually all drugs because of damage to the mitochondria. It makes you crave carbohydrates so you gain weight. It's a chemical poison and you can't drink one diet soda a day. The free methyl alcohol converts to formaldehyde and embalms living tissue as the Trocho Study has shown. "If you want to get fat NutraSweet is where its at." Also the Ramazzini Study shows aspartame is a multipotential carcinogen. I notice this is on men's health. One might consider that aspartame damages the hypothalmus and triggers male sexual dysfunction. Aspartame should be immediately banned. There is a 1000 page medical text on it called Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic by H. J. Roberts, M.D., www.sunsentpress.com Furthermore, the movie Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World, www.soundandfury.tv explains how Don Rumsfeld got it on the market after the FDA had revoked the petition for approval.

Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in coffee crystals and vanilla until well blended. Stir in melted chocolate. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the dry ingredients just until everything comes together. Cover, and let stand for 35 minutes so the chocolate can set up.   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into walnut sized balls, or drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets, leaving 2 inches between cookies.   Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies will be set, but the centers will still be very soft because of the chocolate. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.     OMG! Sweet!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	These are super easy, and YUMMY!

In-fact having too much can be bad for you.  The *only* people in the world who get protein deficiencies are those in countries with famine, as they can't get enough calories to live.     Take a read of  http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/protein.htm  and  http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/prote...|`|WtZXICMEaa	You should read the book "Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy." It's based on Harvard University research on diet and nutrition. It's not geared towards crazy weight loss--only long-term health, longevity, and healthy weight.     What stands out is their stance on protein and dairy products. Essentially, they stipulate that the whole "calcium emergency" is a myth and that dairy products are by no means essential. You can get protein, and calcium, from a host of other foods, like leafy greens for calcium and whole grains and legumes for protein. In moderation, (the occasional yogurt) dairy is fine, but by no means do we need to be drinking cow's milk as adults (it's just weird, anyway, isn't it?), and shouldn't be eating dairy in excess or as a purported substitute for "protein." It is high in cholesterol and a prime suspect in the causes of high cholesterol, heart disease, and breast cancer. (Yeah, the French eat cheese all the time and are healthy overall, but people don't realize they eat it in much smaller portions and with red wine.)    As for protein, there is no emergency either. The study shows how Americans, of all people, vegetarian or not, are the least of cultures that need to worry about protein intake! We get more protein than we think, with the array of meat and dairy that we're offered growing up; and the image of the mother serving a roast beef or roast chicken to insist that we get enough protein in our diets is an outdated 50's concept to being with.     Seriously, read the book. It's intelligent and written by scientists who are implicating the vegan philosophy even though they're not vegan or even vegetarian.    I hate to be redundant, but high-protein vegetarian foods are soy and soy milk, legumes, nuts (and nut milks), fruits like avocados, and WHOLE GRAINS. No doubt all of which you've heard before. If you still feel hungry, you should probably just be eating more of it to get your required protein.

Heat  oil in a deep fryer or large pot. drain a small amount on paper towels, put in deep fryer and cook until brown. Salt after taking them out. ( the reason to dry them before frying is you don't want the oil to splash because of the water)|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	OVEN FRENCH FRIES       1 tbsp. oil    Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Peel potatoes and cut into long strips about 1/2 inch wide. Dry strips thoroughly on paper towels. Toss in a bowl with oil as if making a salad. When strips are thoroughly coated with the oil, spread them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and place in preheated oven for 35 minutes.  Turn strips periodically to brown on all sides. If a crispier, browner potato is desired, run under broiler for a minute or two. Sprinkle with salt before serving.    Makes 6 servings.|`|iOYCCaoYaa	Well, first here's a awesome recipe for some.    Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries    INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)  2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled   1 cup all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon garlic salt   1 teaspoon onion salt   1 teaspoon salt   1 teaspoon paprika   1/2 cup water, or as needed   1 cup vegetable oil for frying    Add to Recipe Box   My folders:     DIRECTIONS  Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they won't turn brown while you prepare the oil.   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, sift the flour, garlic salt, onion salt, (regular) salt, and paprika into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon.   Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together. Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.    You cook them by a Fry Daddy, or a big pot with boiling oil.|`|lNueekgcaa	NOPE|`|pP7iRc2Daa	Cut your potato to the desired shape and size, skin on or off.  Stand the cut potato in very hot water for about 10 mins.This helps to fix starches which will result in a crispier fry. Ideal temperature is about 70 degrees C.  Drain and dry the potato.  Next fry the potato in oil at about 130 degrees C until the potato is cooked.Lift and drain them. This is the stage most shop bought fries are at.  Now turn up the heat on the oil to 185 degrees C and return the potato and fry till crisp and golden.  If you have little or no kitchen experience I would advise against doing this in a pot of oil as it can be EXTREMELY dangerous. Please use a purpose made deep oil frier.|`|207cmemGaa	Chop your potatoes, pour vegetable oil in a pan and fry'em.

Put onto a hot grill and brown on both sides.    In a Dutch oven or cast iron fry pan, add 1/2 stick of butter, onions, mushrooms and salt. Place lid on top and allow them to sweat.    Add beer and place steaks in pan. Allow to stew until tender.    Combine the thyme, parsley, nutmeg, remaining butter and flour together. Use this to thicken the sauce so as to be able to coat the back of a spoon.|`|4dntstR9aa	Take the meat out of the fridge, season with whatever you want, and let sit at room temperature.  Then when it is come to room temp, BBQ or grille it and when it is cooked the way you like on the grille, let it sit for at least 5 minutes to let the juices redistribute.  This way you will get a juicy steak.  Otherwise you cut into it right off the grille and the first bite is the only one that is juicy, the rest will be dried out.    This is a good tip to remember about any meats.  It works on everything.|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	LONDON BROIL       London Broil cut 2 - 2 1/2 inches thick  1 can cream of mushroom soup  1/2 pkg. onion soup mix  1 beef bouillon cube  1/2 c. water    Mix in a bowl: dissolve beef bouillon cube in 1/2 cup boiling water.

Also, you may want to consider all natural and pesticide free if you can't find organic - the cost of being certified organic is very expensive for smaller farms and companies.  It's about $20 - 40 k to become certified.  Also, you may want to seek out farmers markets and natural grocers.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Why organic?? that is the very most expensive way to eat.

asXq2cFDaa	It should be the other way around. I also think hunting for sport should be banned, that is truly disgusting!    Edit:Carlos, you do know she meant go out and kill your own food?  And do you also know how much food goes to feed animals, if we replaced the land used to farm wiht land to grow carops on, tada, enough food to feed everybody! Enough to feed the starving, to feed Africa!|`|uSqc6bUuaa	im against it|`|9HRkwzruaa	I'm not against it; honestly, the animals are going to be hunted either by us or by an animal predator.  If someone's going to eat meat, it's better for that meat to be raised naturally rather than in some commercial shed where it is fed antibiotics and hormones from its youth, continually impregnated in order to produce milk, or has spent its life with a feeding tube down its throat from day one.    Honestly, there's no fear of the chase in hunting...there's more fear of the chase in nature.  Hunting nowadays involves a hunter staying very still and shooting the animal.  They tend to aim for a part of the body that will kill the animal very quickly, both to keep it as humane as possible and to avoid chasing an animal half a mile through the woods.    I'm not saying it's the best thing ever or anything, but I also don't think it's morally wrong.  If someone chooses to eat meat (which I don't), it's a lot more humane than the alternative.    JMHO...|`|dHHhmcyfaa	I don't think vegetarians have a right to ban hunting just because they have different ethics to other people.    For some people hunting is a pasttime which reconnects them to nature. They have to track their prey and catch it.

AA11490722	my favourite winery of all time here in australia is Brown Brothers Vineyard at Miliwa    my next favourite is St Leonard's and All Saints Estate- both these wineries are owned by the same family and are about 5minutes aways from each other in Wahgunyah in Victoria.    Brown Brothers Cienna is my favourite wine closely followed by their moscato    St Leonard's Muscadello is deliciously light and fruity    Branbock Station Wines are good too- they are pretty cheap- their winery in South Australia is beautiful and the good thing about them is that they donate a percentage of their profits to land-care.

The riper the banana, like just almost totally black skin and really mushy fruit, is the highest sugar content and therefore flavor of any banana. They are best for flavoring cakes and puddings and pie fillings.    Green bananas not having the sugar content don't have much flavor. Green or unripe apples are extremely tart.

UY3zl9dFaa	If you leave any green pepper (jalapeno, bell, etc.) out of the refrigerator it will turn red or orange. It's fine to use. If you didn't buy it too long ago there should be little or no change in flavor.|`|36a3ynpJaa	All peppers eventually turn red,yellow or orange when they are fully ripe.  In fact the only difference between red bell peppers and green peppers is that the red ones have been on the plant for longer.    The reason why they pick peppers green is that the plant will continue to grow new peppers if they are picked unripened.  When they ripen the plant puts more energy into the pepper so it's seeds will be mature when it is taken from the plant or drops off. But in doing so it stops making any more new peppers.|`|9gcZzGtKaa	i used to grow jalapenos and i found that the red/orange unes were not as hot in fact slightly bitter but still good|`|tAD171Uiaa	There will be no change in flavour.    In general, the green peppers (bell, jalapeno etc) have been picked earlier than the red ones.    It will be fine.

Kvass is a beerlike drink that's made mainly from rye bread, although it can be made from grain and fruit, too. The most common way to make kvass is : soak dry, toasted rye bread in water with sugar and lemon, let ferment slightly and drink while still fermenting. You can also make it from rye flour. Below are a few recipes. There are more kvass recipes at:  kwass  And a thread of messages about kvass at:  Kvass    Phaed      Black Bread Kvass    1 1/2 pounds stale black bread, cubed    1 1/2 tbs. dried mint    1 small lemon, cut into chunks    10 cups boiling water    1/2 cup sugar    1 tsp. cream of tartar    1 package active dry yeast    8 grains of white rice      Place the bread cubes on a baking sheet and toast in a 325     degrees oven for about 20  minutes, or until dry.

To the liquid add the sugar,     the cream of tartar and the yeast, which has been dissolved in     a little of the liquid. Stir well to mix. Cover the container,     let stand undisturbed for 8 hours. The next day, strain once     more through cheesecloth and pour into a 1-quart bottle. Add     the 8 grains of rice. Seal. Let stand for 8 hours more at room    temperature. Then strain once more through cheesecloth into a     clean bottle and refrigerate until ready to use.

Honey kvass is brewed for weddings and other festivities.   ----------------   Kvass      This recipe is from the book "Wines, Beers and Spirits by Maurice     Hanssen and Jacqueline Dineen, Baronet Publishing Co. New York, 1978.     Kvass is very refreshing on a hot summer's day and is quickly made     from black bread and yeast. It is quite like weak beer and is     fermented and slightly alcoholic, but must be stored in the     refrigerator using corks, not screw-in stoppers or else it will go     on fermenting and blow.      This, to me, looks very similar to the Sumerian recipe which Anchor     Brewery of San Francisco recreated a couple of years ago.       Ingredients: (for 10 bottles)    1 pound (1/2 k), Dry Black Bread     24 cups, Boiling Water     1 1/2 lbs (3/4 k) Sugar     2 ounces (56g), Fresh Compressed Yeast     1/2 cup, Sultanas (yellow seedless raisins)     Procedure:    Put the bread into a large container and then add the boiling     water. When the mixture is lukewarm 
xrRZeROmaa	Google Yin and Yang of Chinese cooking, and you will find a dearth of information about the methods and reasons for their use in Chinese cooking.    "Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance."  (Confucius)    Written by Rhonda Parkinson    Yin and yang. Hot and cold. Male and female.  The philosophy of yin and yang lies at the heart of Chinese culture. The first references to yin and yang come from the I Ching, the five classic works compiled and edited by Confucius.  Taken literally, yin and yang mean the dark side and sunny side of a hill.  People commonly think of yin and yang as opposing forces.  However, it is really more appropriate to view them as complementary pairs.  The Chinese believe problems arise not when the two forces are battling, but when there is an imbalance between them in the environment.  Floods, divorce, or even a fire in the kitchen - all can be attributed to disharmony in the forces of yin and yang.    This is the traditional symbol for the forces of yin and yang, sometimes described as two fish swimming head to tail.    How does the concept of yin and yang relate to food?  A basic adherence to this philosophy can be found in any Chinese dish, from stir-fried beef with broccoli to sweet and sour pork. There is always a balance in color, flavors, and textures. However, belief in the importance of following the principles of yin and yang in the diet extends further. Certain foods are thought to have yin or cooling properties, while others have warm, yang properties.  The challenge is to consume a diet that contains a healthy balance between the two.  When treating illnesses, an Oriental physician will frequently advise dietary changes in order to restore a healthy balance between the yin and yang in the body. For example, let's say you're suffering from heartburn, caused by consuming too many spicy (yang) foods.  Instead of antacids, you're likely to take home a prescription for herbal teas to restore the yin forces.   Similarly, coughs or flu are more likely to be treated with dietary changes than antibiotics or cough medicines.    Almost no foodstuff is purely yin or yang - it's more that one characteristic tends to dominate.  This is why there is not complete agreement among experts as to which foods exhibit yin or yang forces.  It also reinforces that it is not so much the individual ingredients, as the the balance and contrast between ingredients in each dish, that is important. Interestingly, cooking methods also have more of a yin or yang property, as the list below demonstrates.    Cooking Methods:     Yin Qualities:        * Boiling      * Poaching      * Steaming     Yang Qualities:        * Deep-frying      * Roasting      * Stir-frying    Types of Foods:   Yin Foods  /       Yang Foods  Bean Sprouts / Bamboo  Cabbage  /        Beef  Carrots           /        Chicken  Crab          /        Eggs   Cucumber   /       Ginger  Duck         /         Glutinous Rice  Tofu         /         Mushrooms  Watercress   /       Sesame Oil  Water           /       Wine|`|fd69272cc2b6016b2264e570e7b7a247aa	wikipedia got excellent information!|`|JPBggXcwaa	chinese food has LOTS of oil and sodium....they use a lot of seafood and they like to use fire to cook.....like fire in genaral....if u know what i mean...

F8GUqsqiaa	Chocolate is not healthy, unless it is dark. It's really not that great of a snack, probably full of calories since almonds already have a ton of calroies for a little bit, and the chocolate just piles on more calories.|`|1hciyvKdaa	To me its a healthy snack if you want something chocolate that is at least a little healthy.  I like real ingrediants, real sugar, real chocolate, real nuts.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	so good|`|bJoUNoUoaa	They are good if you would like to get some energy adn they taste good.Plus they are lite so they wont ruin a diet.|`|AA10625089	Not too bad of a snack if you ask me. Almonds are good for you and chocolate releases the "feel good" hormone serotonin. Even better if you get the dark chocolate which contains anti-oxidants.
0XgUvNApaa	you over mixed the batter.     and by the way the difference between cake, pastry, and bread flour is the protein and starch content.. not how small it was milled.. and all purpose flour is just a mixture of bread and pastry flour.   bread flour is usually 12-14 percent protein  cake flour is 5-8 percent protein  pastry flour is 8-9 percent protein  a.p flour is 9-12 percent protein    anyways, dont slam the pan down because that can cause the cake to not rise as well.  When you mix your batter mix it until it is just together, dont keep going and going becasue it will add extra air to it and then make tunneling, or big holes, in your cake|`|NRg4dreTaa	If you have an oven light, leave it on to check the cake, rather than opening the oven. Make sure you don't slam any doors or run in the kitchen, the result will make you cake fall, as in it will be flat.|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Leaven it correctly|`|GJJbk023aa	Be sure you add the leavening correctly and after you pour it into the pans, smack the pans on the counter to get out any extra air bubbles. That should help.|`|Qh5Pollvaa	Are you sure its not suppose to be like that?    Make sure all of the inregients were the right amount and they were all in.     Make sure everything is clean and make sure you dont open the oven door until its atleast nearly done.    ^-^|`|qaMrAspCaa	You should double check the recipe to make sure you did everything right.  You might have over mixed it, under mixed it. Sometimes if your flour is really old or a brand your not used to it will actually be a little dry and it'll absorb more of the liquids than it is suppose to causing a different outcome. There are so many things that could have happened.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	sift all dry ingredients together three times. this blends them correctly and makes sure the leavening agents are all spread out.    Cake flour is the finest milled of any flour. All purpose flour gives larger holes texture to the cake. Bread flour gives really large holes texture to the cake.    If the cake says to beat the egg yolks into the batter, and beat the whites stiff, then carefully fold the whites into the batter.    Not knowing what your recipe was, this is as much help as I can give you.    The end result is the taste of the cake, not the texture.|`|OuPC3s0Daa	I recently took a cake decorating class and had the same problem.

(drink your daily dose of Vitamin C with the remaining 1/2 cup.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	Well see how many cans of water go into a can of concentrate.    For example lets say that 3 cans of water go into a pitcher to use up all the concentrate.  And a can is usually 335mL in volume.  So that would equal a total of 1340ml of water and frozen juice.  There are 250mL in a cup so it would take approx. 1/5" of the can to make one cup of juice (or 67mL).    You can do the same calculation for imperial or if it requires more cans of water.    But it is way easier to just make the juice in a pitcher and drink it for the next day or two.  Because where are you going to store the remaining frozen juice?    EDIT:  There are 8oz in a cup so 3oz is just over 1/3 cup.
n7KCez59aa	Hi !    Veganism is a diet and lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose.Vegans endeavor not to use or consume animal products of any kind. The most common reasons for becoming a vegan are an ethical commitment or moral conviction concerning animal rights, the environment, human health, and spiritual or religious concerns.     Of particular concern to many vegans are the practices involved in factory farming and animal testing, and the intensive use of land and other resources required for animal farming.    Vegetarianism is the practice of a diet that excludes meat (including game and slaughter by-products), fish (including shellfish and other sea animals) and poultry.There are several variants of the diet, some of which also exclude eggs and/or some products produced from animal labour such as dairy products and honey.    Most vegetarians consume dairy products, and many eat eggs. Lacto-vegetarianism includes dairy products but excludes eggs , ovo-vegetarianism includes eggs but not dairy, and lacto-ovo vegetarianism includes both eggs and dairy products.    Semi-vegetarianism consists of a diet largely of vegetarian foods, but may include fish and sometimes even poultry, as well as dairy products and eggs. The association of semi-vegetarianism with vegetarianism in popular vernacular, particularly pescetarianism (also called pesco-vegetarianism and described as a "vegetarian" diet that includes fish, has led to what vegetarian groups cite as improper categorisation of these diets as vegetarian.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	vegetarians don't eat beef, chicken, pork or fish.  vegans don't give any money to animal abusers|`|HuJmTs8xaa	Vegetarians cut out only meat from their diets and vegans cut out everything that comes from an animal.

It simply does not work like that.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Vegans eat no animal products (such as dairy, eggs and meat and even honey), and no products containing animal derivative (such as gelatine).

pumHU9s9aa	Your Tim Hortons snacks are not healthy and full of sugar.  Most of your diet sounds good, but I think need to get some more protein and vegetables.  You also need calcium.  If you don't like milk, try using spinach or another deep, leafy green.  You need to eat more and eat a more balanced diet than fruit, fruit snacks, and sugary high-glucose treats.  You should be eating 3-5 servings of fruit and vegetables each day, 3 protein, 3 dairy (calcium) servings, and more high quality starches, like whole wheat cereal, whole grain breads and so on.   Balancing out proteins and carbohydrates will help you feel healthier.|`|dCUOdbEbaa	are u serious O_o that is WAY healthy|`|KBCFVZVNaa	Thats food is like really healthy!!!|`|sSiGcBPdaa	you're way under weight! unless you're like 4 ft. 6 in. you should eat more.

You are eating too much sugar for one thing. Fat-free  doesn't mean sugar free.   You have no whole grains therefore this is unhealthy.  Your lunch is BAD. Sugar bad, fruit good.  The snack is terrible. More sugar and white flour. No good.  Have you thought of adding some more veggies to your  diet. Carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, brocolli.  How about some fiber-rich legumes such as chick peas,  cannellini, kidney beans?  No dairy I notice. Are you lactose intolerant?  You can get lactose-free milk and cheese.  What are you drinking? Nothing?  No water, lemonade, vegetable juice?  Is that fish cake fried? If yes, bad.  Fish cakes have a lot of breading, usually.  You eat a lot of processed food.  You will not develop good bones and muscle with  this diet.  Do you eat apples, oranges, pears, melons?  Do you eat cereal ever?  Do you eat mainly packaged food?  I learned to cook at age 10. You could  learn to cook now rather than eat processed/  packaged food ... unless, of course, you made that  Japanese pancake dish, which I doubt.  Do you eat whole wheat pasta?  What about LEAN meats and chicken?  Or baked or broiled fish instead of those fishcakes?  You can go to your public library and find books  on nutritous food.  Otherwise, if you continue eating like you describe  you will ruin your teeth, bones. hair, and skin.  Look up what a Mediterranean diet is.  You just might like it.  Good luck and pay attention to what you  put into your body.
DFXS4SB4aa	In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed in solvent that contains as much of the chemical composition of coffee as possible without also containing the caffeine in a soluble form. The process is repeated anywhere from 8 to 12 times until it meets either the international standard of having removed 97% of the caffeine in the beans or the EU standard of having the beans 99.9% caffeine free by mass. Coffee contains over 400 chemicals important to the taste and aroma of the final drink; this effectively means that no physical process or chemical reaction will remove only caffeine while leaving the other chemicals at their original concentrations.|`|AA10911217	the beans are steamed then the caffeine is removed probably using solvent

I wonder if that's why we're all feeling ill now. There's some in the freezer too......<br>  I think I'm done with them.

AA12336927	I like Paula Deen's recipe for a quick and easy one      Bobby's Goulash    Ingredients:        * 2  lb  lean ground beef      * 2 large onion, chopped      * 3 cloves garlic, chopped      * 3  cup  water      * 2 (15-ounce) cans tomato sauce      * 2 (15-ounce) cans diced tomatoes      * 2  tablespoon  Italian seasoning      * 3 bay leaves      * 3  tablespoon  soy sauce      * 1  tablespoon  Paula Deen's House Seasoning ( I keep this on hand)      * 1  tablespoon  Paula Deen's Seasoned Salt ( I just used Lawrey's)      * 2  cup  elbow macaroni, uncooked       Directions:    In a Dutch oven, saute the ground beef over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Break up the meat while sauteing. Spoon off any grease. Add the onions and garlic to the pot and saute until they are tender, about 5 minutes. Add 3 cups water, along with the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, bay leaves, soy sauce, House Seasoning, and seasoned salt. Stir well. Place a lid on the pot and allow this to cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Add the elbow macaroni, stir well, return the lid to the pot, and simmer for about 30 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the bay leaves, and allow the mixture to sit about 30 minutes more before serving. Serve with garlic bread and a salad.    Prep Time: 15 minutes  Cook Time: 1 hour 35 minutes  Difficulty: Easy  Yield: 6 servings (unless Bobby's eating, then only 3 servings)|`|MS6IzOPLaa	I never liked goulash until I tasted my mother-in-laws recipe.

Add 1/2T garlic salt, 1/2T italian seasoning for every 1 lb noodles.  When the noodles and hamburger are done, combine in a pot and add V-8 juice until it is the consistency that you like.

If you don't have one of the ones with a removable liner for browning, start it off in a heavy skillet and transfer it to a Crock-Pot, or just make it the old-fashioned way in a heavy cast iron Dutch oven. Great for camp fire cooking!  Cut pork into 2 inch cubes, removing all traces of fat. Heat bacon in a heavy dutch oven until crunchy, then crumble. In same skillet, saute onions and cook, stirring constantly for 3-4 minutes of until soft and golden. Add garlic and paprika; cook, stirring for 2 more minutes (do not let garlic brown).    Add vinegar, pork, salt and caraway seed, stirring well. Add enough broth to barely cover the pork. Reduce heat to low setting and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour or until pork is almost, but not quite tender.    To thicken, stir in Wondra flour. Add sour cream; stir well.    Cover; simmer for 20 minutes, or until meat is tender. The sauce should have a consistency similar to heavy cream. If the sauce is too thin, cook without cover until sauce has thickened; if too thick, add a small amount of broth.    Serve with boiled baby potatoes or over buttered noodles or steamed rice.    About 6 servings.|`|6kFiajUQaa	Hi Rosie!     I have never made a goulash dish but it does sound interesting.

Parboil the tomatoes for one minute in boiling water that has just been removed from the burner. Drain. Using a sharp small knife, remove the skins of the tomatoes. (If the tomatoes are too hot, you can protect your finger tips by rubbing them with an ice cube between tomatoes.) Once the tomatoes are peeled, cut them in halves or quarters and remove the seeds and juice from their centers. Also cut out and discard the stem area. Why use plum tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes? The skins are much thicker and there are fewer seeds and less juice.<br>  <br>  2 Make sure there is a top rack in place in your oven. Turn on the oven to 450°F to preheat. <br>  <br>  3 While the oven is heating, chop up the tomatoes finely. Put tomatoes, garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, vinegar in a bowl and mix. Add the chopped basil. Add salt and pepper to taste.<br>  <br>  4 Slice the baguette on a diagonal about 1/2 inch thick slices. Coat one side of each slice with olive oil using a pastry brush. Place on a cooking sheet, olive oil side down. You will want to toast them in the top rack in your oven, so you may need to do these in batches depending on the size of your oven. Once the oven has reached 450°F, place a tray of bread slices in the oven on the top rack. Toast for 5-6 minutes, until the bread just begins to turn golden brown.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can toast the bread without coating it in olive oil first. Toast on a griddle for 1 minute on each side. Take a sharp knife and score each slice 3 times. Rub some garlic in the slices and drizzle half a teaspoon of olive oil on each slice. This is the more traditional method of making bruschetta. <br>  <br>  5 Align the bread on a serving platter, olive oil side up. Either place the tomato topping in a bowl separately with a spoon for people to serve themselves over the bread, or place some topping on each slice of bread and serve. If you top each slice with the tomatoes, do it right before serving or the bread may get soggy.<br>  <br>  Makes 24 small slices. Serves 6-10 as an appetizer. Or 3-4 for lunch (delicious served with cottage cheese on the side.)

Any type of seafood, should not be eaten as leftovers even after being refrigerated for more than 2-3 days.  The next time you have leftover Salmon, here is a tip....find a good Salmon spread dip recipe (there are many online).  This way, you do not waste this good food either.  Throw that bad boy in your food processor along with the other needed ingredients & follow the recipe which you choose.  Then place it in a sealed-tight container back in the fridge & let it chill for at least 2 hours.  Get yourself some crackers & maybe some wine if you'd like & enjoy.  Just make sure you do use the Salmon Spread Dip within 3 days, even if the other ingredients are fresher.  I am originally from New Orleans, so I do know a lot about seafood.  Seafood is a very hard thing to trust.  Quite frankly, the sooner you eat it after preparation the better. Do not ever listen to anyone that tells you, "if it smells good eat it".  Many people have suffered severely, even from restaurants with food poisoning after eating food that tasted good & had no foul smell. If they had known the food was contaminated, they certainly would have not eaten it.  Leftovers on most fish do not even taste the same later.  However, what is worse....it can cause you some very horrible health issues....seriously. Hope this idea & my tips for in the future really help you.  As for now, throw it out as it is just not worth it! Try my idea & remember my tips for the next time you have leftover Salmon. Good luck in the future.|`|AA11767076	Fish lasts 2 days refrigerated, tops, after being cooked.

They are really easy to make.  Simply cut potatoes into wedges, shove them in a bag with a generous helping of oil and some seasoning (I usually use chicken seasoning) shake them around a bit and then spread them out on a big baking sheet.  They need about 45 mins in a hot oven to cook, but you can speed them up by giving them 10 mins in a microwaveable dish before throwing them on the baking sheet and then they'll probably cook in the same 30 mins as your pie.<br>  <br>  I usually serve it with steamed broccoli, carrots and peas.

I cook venison steaks slightly less than beef...if you cut into it and its too rare for you, you can always put it back on the fire, but its hell to try and un-cook it!    If you are talking back strap, leave it whole...sprinkle with basil, thyme and black pepper and place in a dish with soy sauce and a little red wine. Marinate at least 20 min...I like to let it set on the counter covered until it reaches room temperature. Grill on an insanely hot charcoal fire 'charred rare'...Cooking times can vary depending on thickness of the piece of meat and temp of the fire...let stand about ten minutes and slice into medallions to serve.  Another good grilling cut is the first steak off the ham.

36a3ynpJaa	I think you could do several batches with different amounts of yeast and then put your results in your paper.      Try a brewer's supply store for your ingredients.  1/8 tsp per gallon is enough, but you also need some other equipment like a bubbler and some fructose sugar.    http://www.alpharubicon.com/kids/makesod...    You can't overcarbonate it.  The amount of gas the soda can hold will depend on how cold it is.  The colder it is the more CO2 it can hold.  Ask your teacher about this.  Any extra will bubble away.    We used to make soda using dry ice.  You put the dry ice and mix in a pressure cooker and let it go until it stops rocking(don't put it on the stove!)  Try an Ice cream store for dry ice.  It is about $2 a pound and your soda will taste better.  Your teacher can help you find it.  It doesn't last though.  It is also nice since you can make it in under half an hour instead of three days with yeast.   Try Salvation army for a pressure cooker if you can't find one to borrow.  You can use a plastic container and lid with a small hole in a pinch, but it won't be as fizzy.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	you are only going to need a tiny amount of yeast, a teaspoon of dry yeast would be more than enough for a gallon of soda.  It is critical that you do not use too much sugar if you do your bottles will explode.  You can us artificial sweeteners but you will only need a teaspoon of sugar to carbonate a twelve ounce bottle of soda.|`|6QJe4Mlyaa	I just saw this on the Food Network last night.  Alton Brown made a ginger "beer" using ginger, water, sugar and yeast.  I am sure the recipe will be on their website check there.  I know there was not much yeast used.  He did say that after it is done you have to open the bottle every so often so as the bottle does not explode.  Pretty sure you could use the same "recipe" for other flavors of soda if you don't want the ginger flavor.

This is a big question because there is a whole world of spices that have developed for uses in different cuisines.  Some spices (hot peppers and chilli) will promote sweating, which can be useful to cool you in hot climates.  (They will also make your nose run and that can help a cold).    Many spices (and herbs) have a calming effect and will reduce flatulence and aid digestion so are eaten in dishes with pulses.    The medicinal properties of some are not generally known.  For example extract of star anise is used in the manufacture of anti-bird flu medication.    Nutmeg is banned in prison kitchens because apparently if you ingest a large quantity it can give some sort of high (dont try it)    In short the advice to bear in mind is to try and understand the original recipes and consider why a spice might be there.  Think about fish and chips - we know that you need some kind of acid with it to help digestion, whether it's tomato sauce, vinegar or lemon.  Someone from another culture may not know that and if they eat it would think what greasy indigestible stuff it is.    In the same way we might look at a recipe for curry and, not knowing what asafoetida (Hing) is might just leave it out. It may be that particular spice that makes the recipe combination taste right - and the spice is a known digestive aid. So we make the recipe without and wonder why it isnt good and repeats on us.    Spices and herbs both need to be considered as the same thing. For example Dill seed is a spice, Dill leaves are a herb.  Herbs are just green spices.    Some spices are a useful source of protein - like sesame seed    Turmeric is the big one at the moment.  It doesnt add much flavour and for years people thought it's main benefit was to add colour to a dish. However, now it is being promoted as a preventative for lots of things like arthritis and especially Alzhiemers.    The soruce below is for culinary use of spices not medicinal but has good explanations of each herb and spice and how you can use them.|`|tUu5N2vcaa	if you eat spicy food in moderation it is good for you  eat too much and a hole in your stomach may occur.|`|rU8M25IKaa	Just like any other food as long as you don't over do it..

When you drop the tortilla pieces into the boiling 'chicken soup' , the excess flour will cook and thicken the broth|`|URyg465Eaa	you can make a roux which is equal parts of butter and flour.  If you use 2Tbs of each you can melt the butter in a pan, mix in the flour and let the flour cook for a few minutes without getting too brown and then you can whisk some of the broth in and return it to the pot.  Or use a blend of water and cornstarch.  Mix it separately to stir out all the lumps and then add to your broth.  It will get thick when the broth boils.|`|762867c9c785bebe44cfcfcc94149f3baa	Make sure the soup is really hot.  Melt 1/2 cup of butter and add 2 T of flour and mix well.

Add the salt, celery, pepper, carrots, celery and potatoes. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 40 minutes.   In a mixing bowl, prepare biscuit mix according to package directions. After simmering soup for 40 minutes, drop rounded tablespoonfuls of the biscuit mixture into the pot and let them cook a bit between additions of dumplings, so that they do not stick together.   With a wire whisk, mix together about 1 1/2 cups of water with the flour, then add flour mixture to the soup pot until the broth has the consistency of gravy. Dig in and enjoy the meal!
TJOHxhEUaa	If you have any other apertif, like vermouth or St. Raphael, use that.  If not, use some dry white wine.

I am trying to get away from that corn syrup junk, too.|`|ZIYdGasPaa	We use Stevia around here, have for about 3 years now. You may have seen the recent commercials for a product called Truvia? Just a brand name for the Stevia. I don't know how good Truvia is, because depending on how they process the Stevia it can be sweet or sort of bitter. I know our favorite brand is sold by Stevia Smart. We use the powder, not the liquid.    I thought I'd check and see if they sold Coffee Flavors as well, and they do! http://steviasmart.com/stclfl.html I can't attest to if they're any good, but I do know I love their Stevia in my coffee w/a pump of flavor by someone else that doesn't contain sweetners. So I would assume that their coffee flavors are good! I think I'm going to have to get me some of their Peppermint drops!     Stevia is super concentrated, and if they say it isn't it's because they've put a filler in there with it. I found that the perfect measurement for me is 1/2 of a dash per 6-8 oz's.     I'm allergic, horribly, to aspartame, and even sometimes I have a negative reaction to sucralose. Stevia works great for me, and I'm so happy I found out about it. It took me a little while to adjust to the flavor, because it is a little different from sugar, but after a couple days I couldn't have told you the difference. It definitely didn't have the awful taste that diet products have.|`|N94BrWymaa	These are the ingredients to liquid coffemate flavored creamers    Ingredients: WATER, SUGAR, COCONUT OIL, SODIUM CASEINATE (A MILK DERIVATIVE)**, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, MONO- AND DIGLYCERIDES, ARTIFICIAL COLORS. **Not a source of lactose.

qkYv5c6uaa	It depends on the brand.  I did find one recipe online that does not use gelatin: http://find.myrecipes.com/recipes/recipe...
ZS7Ew7F3aa	For me, the basics are:  vegetable bouillon  garlic  onion powder  salt  pepper  & a dash of cinnamon (yes, in everything!)  I also like fresh rosemary, which can be available in your garden all year long!    The key to any soup or stew is to start with a rue.   In the same pan you will be making the soup/stew in melt a couple of tbsp of butter/marg or oil, stir in diced onion & all ingredients listed above...and any other spices you want. Make sure there is always enough butter/oil to keep everything from sticking to the bottom. If you plan on adding mushrooms to the recipe, now's a good time to add them!   Once onions are cooked (clear) start adding your water, then whatever other ingredients to complete the recipe.   If you lose too much flavor with the water, just add a little more of each spice until it's to your liking.  A rue is the key to a flavorful broth!    EDIT - Leftcoast, I believe you're right about rues & cream sauces. I always start with a rue for cream sauces but over the years I began making a rue for almost everything & have learned that it intensifies the overall flavor immensely! Not sure if it's traditional or not but I love what it does for my dishes!!|`|ODf41iN4aa	Mighty depend on the type of soup.  I like cumin like Melissa, but not salt.  Cumin would be good with beans & diced green chile peppers.  Yum, yum.  Would be good with corn bread.      For an Indian lentil dahl or split mung dahl, I might add cumin, but I'd definitely add curry powder or mix my own.  Dahl is good as a soup, or if allowed to thicken a little, over rice.    With vegetable broth or vegetable stew, I'd be more likely to add dried tarragon leaves unground or dried rosemary (from a big shrub in my garden, dried & then ground in a coffee grinder) or fresh cilantro (grown in a clay pot) or fresh basil (grown in a clay pot or purchased fresh) or fresh or dried sweet marjoram.  Cumin or curry powder would be fine, too.  It depends on what you like & your mood.    The rue Bein' Cheeky suggests is interesting because cooks in India often release the flavor & beneficial qualities of herbs by sauteing them in oil or ghee (clarified butter) before adding other ingredients for curry or dahl.  However, I associate rue with a white sauce or a creamed soup, adding milk to a mixture of oil, butter, & flour that has been sauteed in a saucepan.  It has to be cooked very carefully to avoid burning the flour.  The amt of milk added would depend on whether you want a white sauce or a creamed soup.  Now I'm inspired to look it up.  She could very well be correct, or it could be that we're both right.    Mmm...I love carrot soup & squash soup, & the ginger with orange zest that Steph suggests sounds yummy.  I also like sweet potato soup but prefer minimal seasoning such as a tiny amount of tarragon or sweet marjoram & perhaps ghee to avoid over-powering the sweet potato flavor.    Your question totally made me hungry.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	carrot and squash soups are nice w/ginger & orange zest  veggie soup w/fresh rosemary & basil  potato and leek w/lavender     All the Mrs Dash blends are nice to and salt free.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	bay leaf|`|NNiN0tK0aa	it depends on your personal tastes...  i adore cumin and add it to everything.....cumin and salt together are magical....

doz7RIoeaa	No.   The cause of hunger and starvation in many places is not the use of land for animal farming. It is the gross uneven distribution of wealth inefficient food distribution and an over-sized population.   For example Africa, a continent plagued with starvation problems for centuries has a very small animal farming industry but has extensive crop farming industry. They grow enough food. But the people cannot afford it or have no access to it. And if you go to places where starvation is a common occurrence, meat is hardly a staple. And realize that because people have land, they can plant anything they want on it. Food crops cannot be grown just anywhere. But animals can be raised almost everywhere.     Countries like the US on the other hand, have a huge animal farming industry yet rarely suffers from starvation. And they throw away 100 million tons of food a year, Not inedible, not leftovers, perfectly good food that has gone past it's "prime" or "best consumed before" date. How many people can you feed with 100 millions tons of food?  And why can't locals in other countries afford their own food? Because US food companies have either bought the land or have outbid them for the produce. Why sell quinoa or soy beans for 50 cents a lb to a local peasant when you can sell it to US companies for triple so they in turn can sell to US consumers as the new wonder food and as cruelty free veggie burgers for even more?    Simplistic ideas like that may seem ideal but reality says otherwise.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	Raising animals for food is an extremely inefficient way to feed a growing human population. The U.S. livestock population consumes enough grain and soybeans to feed more than five times the entire U.S. population. One acre of pasture produces an average of 165 pounds of beef; the same acre can produce 20,000 pounds of potatoes. If Americans reduced their meat consumption by only 10 percent, it would free 12 million tons of grain annually for human consumption. That alone would be enough to adequately feed each of the 60 million people who starve to death each year.

I believe we would have enough food, but I know that can not be good for the environment.   A Cornell study shows that eating small amounts of meat rather than large amounts of meat is actually better for the environment than is even vega/tarianism-- which is only "the best" when taken as individuals, not as communities.     Additionally, it is important to recognize that raising crops requires the use of pesticides, which kills insects, and birds, and leeches into local water supplies. Even organic pesticides are lethal (or they wouldn't work), and kill local wildlife, pollute local waters that wildlife require to drink from, and have detrimental affects on all of the smaller cycles of life (insects, birds, reptiles, etc.).|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Yes.    For one, you wouldn't need to feed an overpopulation of farm animals crops and water to support an overpopulation of human beings--  over 10 billion land animals per year in the US alone (HSUS).  That doesn't include seafood.|`|8cfJKISGaa	why would everyone in the world be vegetarian? i love meat and for every animal that you don't eat, I'm gonna eat three.|`|AA11525569	if everyone was vegan (im going to assume youre talking about the true meaning of the word vegetarian.. not consuming or using any animal products or by products, otherwise known as vegan) there would be plenty of food!!!    10k of grain is fed to cows to produce 1kg of beef. it's just being thrown away. feed the grain to the starving nations directly, not through livestock to overfed americans    and by getting rid of those factory farms.. there would be a lot more space to grow actual food like fruits, vegetables, legumes.. ect.     the amount of drinking water would increase as well.. as a vegan, i can leave my shower on 24/7 for an entire year, and i would still not waste as much water as someone who eats an animal based diet.     the environment would also improve, it takes an incredible amount of energy to raise animals as food. and factory farms create more waste then all the cars and planes in the world. and dont forget about all of the waste from the animals.. the requirements for the disposal of animal waste are far less strict than for human waste, its insane how much the waste from the animals pollute our oceans.     all of these things impact the worlds food supply.     so to answer your question, we would have wayyy more than enough food to survive if everyone in the world went vegan.

Season it with salt and sprinkle with lemon juice to taste (optional). <br>  <br>  Serve warm or at room temperature.|`|MIx1fSbdaa	Easiest recipe ever: patacones. Latin American. They're really just plantains you fry, squish, and fry again, but here's a play-by-play:<br>  <br>  1) Buy some green plantains (you ought to be able to find them somewhere; even we have them up in the North-Eastern US Caucasian-ville). They say you're supposed to cut the skin off first with a knife, but I like to heat them in the microwave a few seconds or cut them in sections first (heating them makes them easier to 'peel', as does cutting the sections first).<br>  2) Chop them into sections about an inch long (it doesn't matter much how long they are, so don't pull out a ruler or anything). Cut off the peel if you haven't already.<br>  3) Heat oil on a stovetop, medium heat<br>  4) Put the pieces in the oil for a bit, cut-end down. They don't even need to get brown.<br>  5) Turn them over (I use tongs), then take them out and let them cool a bit.<br>  6) Squish them down with a flat object (a large knife works well, or a spatula).<br>  7) Return to the oil, fry until golden-brown.<br>  Done!<br>  <br>  If the plantains at your nearest store are too ripe (dark yellow to black peel--black does NOT mean spoiled), just cut them in strips and fry them. Serve with a soft, mild cheese. <br>  <br>  Super-easy!|`|2luTwTkyaa	paella is delicious there are so many recipes i cant really choose but i have a web site for you<br>  <a href="http://www.spain-recipes.com/paellarecipes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spain-recipes.com/paellarecip...</a>

It is an excellent source or protein.  It has  fat, but it is the good fats:  the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).  It is also a good source of folate.

Peanuts have protein and other nutrients. In fact its VERY good for you. Its good for you if your into sports or if your dieting.

I think it was Peter Pan, or something like that. It's not Jiff or Smuckers though, because my cafeteria serves them for lunch on sandwiches sometimes. So certain peanut butters are good, and some are bad. Peanut butter is made out of peanuts, which are nuts, which are protein. So if you need protein, nuts are good!|`|bcDNHQqNaa	I am pretty sure it is.

A PB&J is a very good blend of protein, fat and carbs.|`|teIblDHiaa	Nothing is "good" or "bad" for you if (1) it is a whole food (unprocessed), and (2) it is eaten in moderation. Examples of whole foods: fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, raw nuts and seeds, legumes, fresh fish etc. But if you eat peanut butter everyday, you run the risk of developing an allergy to it. This is true for most foods. So don't eat peanut butter everyday if you choose to eat it. Don't stick to one nut. Alternate it with other nut butters, like almond butter, cashew butter, pecan butter, etc (by the way, they all taste just as good as peanut butter, if not better!) Give other foods a chance too!<br>  <br>  If you eat the same foods all of the time, you also can become deficient in certain nutrients. For instance, peanut butter is a good source of vitamin E but other nut butters are higher in zinc. So eating a varied diet maximizes the variety of nutrients you ingest.|`|AA10196782	it tastes good... lately there has been a salmonella recall for peanut butter, but i think that's over. you may wanna ask the people at your local grocery store, they'd probably know.<br>  <br>  hope i helped! =)|`|AA11402528	well its a nut, nuts are good for you because they have good fats. peanut butters high in protein as well. its fine to eat, but keep in mind how high in fat and calories it is|`|ILpp3ncYaa	In moderation|`|6627NijZaa	peanut oil is good for u but alot of it isnt thats y peanut or peanut butter is good for u once in a while

Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and set aside to cool; once cool shred and set aside. Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve discarding the onion pieces.<br>  <br>  Pour the broth into a measuring cup and add water to make 4 cups of liquid. Return it to the pot or skillet and add the rice, peas, carrots, green beans, ketchup, and salt. Stir well and bring to a boil. Let the liquid evaporate to just below the level of the rice, about 10 minutes, and then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender and fully cooked, 25 minutes.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the peppers and the remaining sliced onions and cook until they're tender, 8 minutes. Shred the cooked chicken meat discarding the skin and bones, and add the chicken to the vegetables.

She uses her own homemade tomato sauce in this recipe, and I think that that's one of the reasons why it tastes so good!

N4xd99Qaaa	Broth is simply just water that has been cooked with other ingredients. So anything can be made to use with broth such as vegetables, chicken, meat, fish. <br>  <br>  Chicken broth<br>  <br>  I saved the chicken bones, fat, and other parts from a chicken dinner I had. Cut up some celery, carrots, and onion. Also added a few pieces of garlic. I like the extra flavor added to the broth but you could just use chicken alone.<br>  <br>  It is best to use a large pot or a stock pot. You will want enough water to cover the ingredients and then some because as you cook some water will evaporate.<br>  <br>  Bring the water to a boil. Add ingredients and then turn down heat to simmer. Let simmer for about 10 hours. If water is decreasing a lot then turn down the heat. <br>  <br>  Afterwards put a strainer on top of a bowl, pot or any container. Strain the items in the pot separating the broth. Put the borth in containers to store until ready for use.|`|cKxZTNxxaa	You can make a vegetable broth like this:<br>  Dice (2) carrots, (2) stalks celery, and (1) diced onion.

Add salt, black pepper and garlic powder to taste and simmer about 20 minutes.

I don't blame you for not cooking with alcohol, I don't do alcohol myself. Not because of religion or anything... just alcoholism runs in the family! To make chicken broth just boil chicken in a pot of water,  you can add a little bit of salt for seasoning, I do and I use 2 tablespoons of butter too for seasoning. Broths are basically just boiling your meats in water to draw the flavor of the meats into the water to make it!

You can use chicken necks, backs, turkey wings or necks, when you go to the poultry section at the grocer they should be there, sometimes you will see the cases. Also towards the end of the meat section they have beef bones, that's if you want a beef broth. Place the chicken or beef in a pot cover with about 2 liters of water, add 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt or kosher, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. and turn the hot plate on to high. <br>  <br>  In the mean time coarsely chop 1 large onion, peel two carrots and cut in half, 2 sticks of celery, clean and cut into three, if you wish peel and cut a parsnip. add these to the pot with a couple of bay leaves. Bring it all to the boil for 10 minutes, then turn heat down to medium for about 15 minutes, then simmer for a good hour, taste for seasoning if it needs more salt or pepper add. by this stage everything should be cooked through, strain the broth into another container, and discard the rest if you wish. Allow the broth to cool, and you can divide it into containers and freeze.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|AA11990014	I always brown my bones in the oven before adding to water. This makes a nice rich color and taste to the broth. Broth can be made from chicken bones, beef bones, vegetables or fish.  Put bones on baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and shake over some salt and pepper.  Put in a 425F oven until bones are nicely browned, about 30 minutes.  Then put in a pot and cover with water.  Add some cut up carrots, onions, celery and add to the pot.  Put in a handful of whole black peppercorns.  Simmer for a couple of hours.  Strain and skim off fat when cool.  This broth can then be frozen in whatever quantity you want.  Use ice cube trays, clean small yogurt cups etc.

Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans. Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. <br>  In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. <br>  Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Then invert onto wire racks to cool completely. <br>  To make filling: In medium saucepan, mix together 1 tablespoon lemon zest, 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1 tablespoon cornstarch until smooth. Mix in 6 tablespoons butter and 3/4 cup sugar, and bring mixture to boil over medium heat. Boil for one minute, stirring constantly. In small bowl, with a wire whisk, beat egg yolks until smooth. Whisk in a small amount of the hot lemon mixture. Pour the egg mixture into the sauce pan, beating the hot lemon mixture rapidly. Reduce heat to low; cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes, or until thick (not to boil). <br>  Pour mixture into medium bowl. Press plastic wrap onto surface to keep skin from forming as it cools. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate 3 hours. <br>  To make frosting: In large bowl, beat confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 teaspoon lemon zest until smooth. Beat in milk, and increase speed and continue to beat until light and fluffy. <br>  To assemble: With long serrated knife, split each cake layer in half horizontally, making 4 layers. Place 1 layer, cut side up, on a serving plate. Spread with half of the lemon filling. Top with another layer, and spread with 1/2 cup frosting.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.<br>     2. Prepare the streusel:<br>     3. In an electric mixing bowl on low speed, using the paddle attachment, beat flour, sugars and salt briefly to combine.<br>     4. Add the butter, increase the mixer speed and beat.<br>     5.

Then you'd have a sweet dough. Try mixing the sugar with water, and letting the strawberries soak in it, to get strawberry juice of a sort. Plus the strawberries will be super sweet. Make the biscuits. Form the sweet dough into round flat balls, then push the middle so there is a large indentation in the middle. Cook them. Then, take the biscuits and spread some of the strawberry sauce on them. Place the sweet dough, with large indentations in the middle, on top, letting the strawberry sauce sort of form an icing.

AA10024510	They are the same yeast animals, the bread machine yeast is just produced in finer grains, so they activate faster.  Old-fashioned "active dry" yeast has larger grains mostly due to the old form of drying the grains.  In old recipes you would activate your yeast before adding it to the flour, but the activation period was only a couple minutes anyway.  Since you've already gone back and forth, you've undoubtedly noticed they really make negligible difference in the machine.  Don't worry about it, use 'em up, and get whatever is on sale.<br>  <br>  Side note, since it wasn't really in your question, but:  rapid rise is much the same as bread machine yeast, just produced in finer grains, and *may* (depending on brand) contain some additives to help the yeast grow faster.  Save your money ;-)|`|eL268hETaa	Bread machine yeast is rapid rise.  You can use the quick rise ones in regular recipes, but I don't think they can be switched vice versa.

0dbbb948636ec1c95b44b9e48d12e2cfaa	I think I know what you mean. When rice cooks it gives off a starchy smell (like when you microwave it). There are 2 things you can do: switch varieties of rice, and rinse you rice. Jasmine rice has a good smell when cooked, sushi rice doesn't hardly smell at all, and wild rice smells strong, no matter what you do with it. Also before cooking your rice, you should rinse it in cold water and rub it between your fingers to remove the extra starch. This will also help you if you use the pan method to cook rice, you can use an extra tight fitting lid and it wont boil over! Less steam, less odor.|`|iOAl0n4taa	I never noticed a smell when cooking rice???|`|7cUDstdjaa	Suggest you don't use a pressure cooker for rice.<br>  <br>  Put it in a Pyrex dish, cover the rice with 1 inch of water (bowl size is unimportant as long as the water surface is 1 inch above the rice)<br>  <br>  Put the lid on the dish and microwave it on high for 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  After the microwave has finished and switched off, do not open the door for about a further 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Your rice will be hot and all the smells, if any will have gone by then.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Cooking rice hardly gives off any smell.

Also, steamed rice and pasta, but pay attention to the serving size.  Most people think a serving of pasta is a plateful, but it is really only 1/2 cup.  Flavor your food with seasonings such as garlic, thyme, rosemary, oregano and boullion for your rice and pasta instead of butter or margarine.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	sandwiches and soup|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Well, you might realize by now that I don't believe in "diets."  I believe in lifestyles.  You definitely don't have to only eat salad!  I think theres a healthy way to make almost anything.  Lets take spaghetti for example- Cook a Spaghetti squash and fix it like spaghetti with sauce, a sprinkle of parmasan cheese, even turkey meatballs.  Or burgers, get whole grain burger buns, and use ground turkey patties.  You could also add a slice of 2% Milk cheese +mustard, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, onion, tomato.  That would actually be a really healthy and well balanced meal.  Something like Mac n Cheese would be a little harder to make healthy, since all of the ingredients are fairly fattening.  You could lessen the fat though by using a mixture of fat free cheese (tends to be sort of rubbery) and 2% milk cheese (to take away the rubbery feel, and add more flavor).  And you could use whole grain noodles.  Oh also most foods which say you can fry, like french fries and chicken nuggets, you can bake them.  I make my own chicken nuggets by taking fresh chicken, cutting into nugget size pieces, then either rolling the nuggets in bread crumbs or good ol shake n bake lol...then bake in the oven.  I eat everything I want, I just make my recipes a healthy way.  Let me know if I can help with any of your fav foods.

Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans. Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. <br>  In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. <br>  Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool in pans on wire racks for 10 minutes. Then invert onto wire racks to cool completely. <br>  To make filling: In medium saucepan, mix together 1 tablespoon lemon zest, 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1 tablespoon cornstarch until smooth. Mix in 6 tablespoons butter and 3/4 cup sugar, and bring mixture to boil over medium heat. Boil for one minute, stirring constantly. In small bowl, with a wire whisk, beat egg yolks until smooth. Whisk in a small amount of the hot lemon mixture. Pour the egg mixture into the sauce pan, beating the hot lemon mixture rapidly. Reduce heat to low; cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes, or until thick (not to boil). <br>  Pour mixture into medium bowl. Press plastic wrap onto surface to keep skin from forming as it cools. Cool to room temperature. Refrigerate 3 hours. <br>  To make frosting: In large bowl, beat confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 teaspoon lemon zest until smooth. Beat in milk, and increase speed and continue to beat until light and fluffy. <br>  To assemble: With long serrated knife, split each cake layer in half horizontally, making 4 layers.

My suggestion is to go easy on the rice. A little bit of rice will make a lot of rolls. If you add too much your rolls will come out chunky! I also suggest getting a lot of roe.

You might also want to try a test run just to see how it comes out.<br>  <br>  I don't know how you'll do yours, but I suggest going traditional with the seaweed on the outside.

OxWmtBSYaa	You can put the fondant right over the cake. It does stick. <br>  <br>  Leave the cake out as long as you cover it.|`|xUNowEfQaa	Yes, put a light crumb coat of buttercream on your cake, then the fondant.  The buttercream works like glue to keep the fondant on the cake.  It also gives an icing for flavor, since most people peel off the fondant before eating.<br>  <br>  I usually refrigerate my fondant cakes, then let them return to room temperature in my COLD, OFF oven.  The oven is cold, and off, but is a large enough area to fit the cake and the door seals out moisture from the air nicely.  So the cake can come to room temp without condensation, which is what makes the cake sticky.  The cake should be fine once you seal it in the fondant.

DT2mU1jOaa	No.<br>  Actually that is my analogy Coke is the bottom of the barrel. Dark or darker beers utilize a variety of specialty grains that impart dark colors and grainy to Chocolaty to coffee flavor notes to a beers' flavor. The grain is roasted in an industrial oven until the desired degree of color is achieved. Many of the roasted grain does not add to the beers alcohol potential but to color and flavor only, but this does depend on the actual specialty grain used.<br>  <br>  This malting company gives a nice picture of what I am attempting to explain.<br>  <a href="http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Products/Default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brewingwithbriess.com/Product...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Specialty_grains" rel="nofollow">http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  To add, through the brewing process further gains and loses of dark color from the wort/beer does occur. In the brew kettle heat causes a reaction which darkens the wort and thus the beer. But this is countered a bit due to precipitation of color pigments during something brewers call a break. Finally, color also settles out of the fermented beer in the fermentation process. This is very subtle and is of no concern to the final color of the beer. <br>  So to end, the beers color is derived from the grains which is regulated by type and amount of the specialty grain used as well as some other minor color contributing processes.|`|a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	No, Dark Beers are made (for the most part) with roasted malt, or roasted barley... though some unsavory brewers add caramel coloring also.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Just FYI Lagers are make with bottom-fermentation yeasts, and Ales are made with top-fermentation yeasts... so ACTUALLY, the lighter colored beers come from bottom-fermentation yeasts|`|8OREBeRdaa	I call allabullshit on that one.

0maJCeLCaa	This is how you get your answer:<br>  First find out how much corn flour goes into one tortilla - that's the easy part actually, You find a recipe, and divide the amount of corn flour by the number of tortillas the recipe makes.<br>  <br>  Then you find out how much flour one ton of frech corn makes. This may be a little trickier, because you'll have to decide if it's ton of fresh kernels or a ton of corn still on the cob ... <br>  But once you have decided on that, you can divide the amount of flour by how much is needed to make one tottilla. <br>  <br>  And voila! You have your answer ;)

FyLfEPv0aa	Several reasons.<br>  <br>  Conventional molding practices would make a thinner cross section right on the edges, ridges smaller than the thickness add strength needed in those areas.<br>  <br>  Ridges also help with ejection out of a mold by offering non-uniform surfaces to be pushed out by the ejectors.<br>  <br>  The glass/plastic gets cold as it travels down the face of the bottle, those ridges allow the cold plastic to move out into an area where it has no negative effect on bonding and curing.  (Otherwise you get a cure point called a cold joint or a cold butt joint where the glass/plastic can't bond as well since it's cold plastic on cold plastic.)<br>  <br>  It adds some break protection for glass by allowing a shatter point sub structure.|`|FjekAwGmaa	It's for grip.
