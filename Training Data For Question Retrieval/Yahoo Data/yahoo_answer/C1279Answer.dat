So if the height of both the cone and hemisphere is 15 cm, and the cone is 10cm, then the hemisphere alone is 5cm.  That means its radius is 5cm.|`|84sZpVwaaa	This question has nothing to do with surface area... If the hemisphere sits on the cone, it's height is exactly the radius of the hemisphere. So you get 15-10= 5 cm .  But this really depends on how the hemisphere sits on the cone. I'm assuming it's sitting with the flat surface against the tip of the cone.|`|QyYp46dAaa	It really depends on how does the hemisphere site (I imagine more logical way)<br>  <br>  all you have to say is height of the hemisphere alone is 15-10=5<br>  now what do you think <br>  the radius of the hemisphere is 5 cm if it site in other way then its radius is 5/2 =2.5

4ELJgnWbaa	regular diodes only let current flow in one direction, zener diodes also do this, but they will allow current to flow in the opposite direction if the voltage is greater than the breakdown voltage
oVz6sPsIaa	Ordinary diodes permit current to pass in only one direction.  They have many uses, one common one being to convert AC currents to DC currents.  <br>  <br>  Zener diodes when biased in reverse break down (ie, permit current to pass) at a particular reverse voltage.  They can be used as a voltage regulator.

The next best will be plain old KY, which does not affect sperm motility, but has some effect on the sperm DNA. This was a lab study, so whether this truly affects the conception rate is not established.
17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	I owned one of these scopes for a while, the SkyWatcher version. While it was a nice little telescope, its mount was flimsy, and its short focal length made it more an instrument for specialized low power viewing, rather than an all-around telescope. If you're interested in deep sky observing, you need to look at more aperture, say 8" or 10", and a better, more solid mount, such as a Dobsonian. The same money will buy you a 6" or 8" Dobsonian, a much better choice for a first telescope.<br>  <br>  Here are a few web pages with good information on beginner's telescopes:<br>  <a href="http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying_a_Telescope.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html</a><br>  <a href="http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.beginner.html" rel="nofollow">http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.begi...</a><br>  <br>  For more advanced information, read Phil Harrington's Star Ware, 4th edition (Wiley).<br>  <br>  You'll get the greatest value for your money with a Newtonian reflector on a Dobsonian mount, such as these:<br>  <a href="http://www.telescope.com/control/category/~category_id=dobsonians/~pcategory=telescopes/~VIEW_INDEX=0/~VIEW_SIZE=1000000" rel="nofollow">http://www.telescope.com/control/categor...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtinc/product.php?class1=1&class2=106" rel="nofollow">http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtin...</a><br>  <br>  Buy from a store which specializes in telescopes and astronomy, either locally or online; don't buy from department stores, discount stores or eBay as mostly what they sell is junk.

If you want to observe deep sky objects, then you really need to get something with a larger aperture. If you buy this scope, you will wish you had bought another one within a year. More aperture simply allows you to see more. Since you have been using binoculars, you already know how disappointing it can be to have a clear sky and not have enough aperture to see very much. M31 and M42 are really nice, but if you are buying a scope anyway, you might as well buy one that will provide decent views of objects like M1, M51, M104, NGC4565, and the Veil Nebula. You will not see those objects very well with this scope. You might barely see something, but it will be disappointing. With your background and your interest level, I would definitely recommend a scope with at least 10 inches of aperture. Good Luck and Clear Skies.

stAeoUeSaa	True Time vs. False Time<br>  <br>  Time is fractal in nature. It repeats itself in definite and regular patterns. That is why some prophecies can have double and even triple reference. You have probably heard the wise ole maxim: “history always repeats itself”. There’s more truth to that than you may know!<br>  <br>  False time ('Satanic Calendar') is the 13:20 ratio of the Tzolkin long count of 5,125 years broken down into 13 baktuns of 144,000 days each. This count only runs from right before the Great Flood til the 'abomination of desolation' (winter solstice 2012). It was given to the bloody Mayan pagans by Pacal Votan. Other parts of the world received it by meduimship, spirit conjuring, and divination like the Chinese I-ching for example.<br>  <br>  True Time is a dispensation of 7777 years that started back in 4762 BC. Joseph Scaliger came VERY close to this with his "Julian Period" in the 16th century. We add 4762 to negative BC dates to get thier True Time date and add 4761 (since there is no zero in our Gregorian calendar) to all AD dates. The 7777 years can be divided into 7 periods of 1111 years. 1111 whispers out in many ways to all ready for True Time understanding and no it is not a coincidence. It can also be broken down into 11 periods of 707 years. These are the 11 'weeks' of mankind's history referred to in the book of Enoch.<br>  <br>  The Tribulation will be from summer 6770pc - summer 6777pc (summer 2009AD - summer 2016AD).

kfuUL88Raa	It is because of the ratio between volume and surface. Cells need to get hold of the needed materials to perform metabolistic processes. These materials are introduced to the cell through the process of difussion. <br>  <br>  Now you can look at it like this: If a cell is a perfect cube with the lines 1cm. The surfuce of the cube is then 6 x 1 x 1 =  6cm^2 and the volume is 1 x 1 x 1 = 1 cm^3. Now lets take a cell with a bigger side line, for example 10 cm. The surface now is 6 x 10 x 10 = 600 cm^2 and the volume is 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000cm^3.<br>  <br>  From these results we can see that in the case of the 1st cube ( 1cm line) a volume of 1 cm^3 is supplied by 6 cm^2 of surface, through which materials can pass. In the second case ( 10 cm line ) the same surface ( 6 cm^2 ) has to supply 10 times the volumen, which is 10 cm^3. That is why cells need to be small.<br>  <br>  PS: the 1 cm / 10 cm lines were just examples for easier understanding, real cells are about 0.00001-0.00005 meters small.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	Cells need to be small because their metabolic reactions depend on diffusion of materials from one part of the cell to another.<br>  <br>  Also, as a cell gets larger,  its surface/volume ratio gets smaller until, at some point, the surface area is too small to allow for enough diffusion of materials into and out of the cell.|`|InoTLoBMaa	this is because their small size allows substances to pass through easily but some plasma membrane are impermeable to certain substances.they are also applying the hypotonic and hypertonic mechanism where hypertonic cells will pass the substances to the hypotonic cells through osmosis or active transport.|`|TN4dEatcaa	if cells did not perform metabolic reactions you would not have any energy. your heart would stop and you would die

9vpzIFBEaa	The 1st answer given is a correct definition of conjugation in spirogyra.  <br>  <br>  To more completely answer your original question I'll just add the following tidbits:<br>  <br>  Protoplasma (or protoplasm) = the cellular components located within the plasma membrane (cytoplasm, nucleus and organelles) <br>  <br>  Plasmogamy = the fusion of cytoplasm between a female and a male gamete. <br>  <br>  Karyogamy = the fusion of pronuclei of two cells, as part of fertilization.<br>  <br>  Formation of a zygospore = the point at which, after the two gametes have fused, that genetic information is exchanged and the founder cell of the new organism is created.<br>  <br>  Because conjugation (or the transfer of genetic information between two cells) includes the movement of protopsmplasm, followed by plasmogamy, then karyogamy, and finally, the formation of a zygospore a correct answer in this case would include #'s 2, 3 4 and 5*.<br>  <br>  *To be precise, conjugation is a separate process from zygospore formation (i.e. conjugation occurs and zygospore formation follows). So, as long as you demonstrate your understanding of the concepts, you could leave #5 out of your answer and still be correct.|`|sa8dElLZaa	Spirogyra can reproduce both asexually and sexually. In asexual reproduction, fragmentation takes place, and Spirogyra simply undergoes intercalary mitosis to form new filaments.<br>  <br>  Sexual Reproduction is of two types:<br>  <br>     1. Scalariform conjugation requires association of two different filaments lined side by side either partially or throughout their length. One cell each from opposite lined filaments emits tubular protuberances known as conjugation tubes, which elongate and fuse, to make a passage called the conjugation canal. The cytoplasm of the cell acting as the male travels through this tube and fuses with the female cytoplasm, and the gametes fuse to form a zygospore.<br>  <br>     2. In lateral conjugation, gametes are formed in a single filament. Two adjoining cells near the common transverse wall give out protuberances known as conjugation tubes, which further form the conjugation canal upon contact. The male cytoplasm migrates through the conjugation canal, fusing with the female. The rest of the process proceeds as in scalariform conjugation.
j4fK15gwaa	Your decimal is 0.501111...<br>  Let's call this value x and multiply it by 100 to give 50.111..., or 100x.<br>  If we subtract x from 100 x, we get 99x. 50.111... - 0.50111... = 49.61.<br>  99x = 49.61. Let's multiply both sides by 100 again so we're dealing with whole numbers.<br>  9900x = 4961.<br>  x = 4961/9900. <br>  This can be simplified by dividing top and bottom by 11 to give 451/900.<br>  If you punch that into a calculator, you'll see that it gives you 0.501111...<br>  So, n = 900.|`|txC0p30daa	Well, I don't think the answer is 1000.  <br>  <br>  501/999 would make n = 999, and 501/999 = .501501501501... which fits the requirments of the problem.

[who'da guessed it]|`|Ve4Iogxxaa	Actually, I think the question is asking for the smallest denominator that would give a decimal starting with 0.501. It need not terminate at 0.501.<br>  <br>  In that case, the answer would be n = 251, with a = 126, as 126/251 = 0.501992032.....<br>  <br>  You can get the answer through a simple trial and error method. You know that if a/n = 0.501...., then a/n is just slightly larger than 1/2. Thus, you can let n = 2a - 1.<br>  <br>  Doing so, you get [a / (2a - 1)]. Then you can try substituting a with increasing numbers, until the value first is 0.501...<br>  <br>  a = 125 will yield a/n = 0.502008032..., and<br>  a = 126 will yield 0.501992032.<br>  <br>  Thus, a = 126, and n = 2(126) - 1 = 251.

The astronomer Fred Hoyle suggested flu epidemics breaking out in remote wildernesses could be a consequence of natural virus seeding from outer space. Bacteria shows a great tolerance to outer space survival. It has been suspected that the 4.5 billion years old Earth is too young for the slow process of the evolution of life, a 13.7 billion years old universe has more chance. <br>  <br>  I suspect no little green men though, because of the vast distances to a possible life bearing planet which could be at least hundreds of light years distance. The energy and time required to make such a journey probably rules it out. Also, since intelligent life in the first place is so unlikely, it might be that we humans are the most advanced life in the whole observable universe. Another thing, first you have to discover a planet which already has life on it, before contemplating using up most of one's own planet's resources on such a venture, easier said than done. Manned space travel beyond the Solar System is most improbable this century, and interstellar travel almost impossible.|`|28fd86ae8f5710704b6a01cc48ab5d33aa	I like Bob B's answer. For most of our existence, we were single-celled organisms. If life exists, it is likely that it is simple. There is nothing to suggest that intelligence or technology are inevitable. The dinosaurs had 300 million years longer than us, and they didn't develop intelligence anywhere near us. If it wasn't for a stray asteroid hitting Earth 65 million years ago, they might still be around. <br>  So, aliens might well exist, but they might be simple cells, and/or so far away that we will never know for sure.|`|KNKLAmuNaa	It is EXTREMELY unlikely that any aliens know we exist. Here's why:<br>  <br>  1. The conditions for life to evolve at all are pretty hard to achieve, so life probably hasn't evolved anywhere near Earth.<br>  <br>  2. Even if it has evolved somewhere nearby, that doesn't mean Intelligent life. Remember that of the 4.6 billion years Earth has been around, humans have only existed for 150 000.<br>  <br>  So, based on the above, we can predict that the chances of intelligent life arising anywhere near our civilization are amazingly small. But, suppose intelligence arises elsewhere. How would they know where to look? None of our space probes have even reached the nearest star, and our radio signals would be almost imperceptible at any real range.<br>  <br>  And, even if by some miracle they found out about us, it is not possible to travel faster than light, so it would take them a VERY long time to get here.<br>  <br>  So, in short, it is pretty likely that aliens exist somewhere, but we probably aren't going to meet them for a long time, if ever.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	No, I don't believe that we have been visited by aliens -- there is no scientific evidence for this.

The small pores of the polyacrylamide gels, however, are not appropriate for larger DNA fragments or intact DNA molecules such as plasmids.

AA10655250	The Concentric ring model also known as the Burgess model is one of the earliest theoretical models to explain urban social structures. It was created by sociologist Ernest Burgess in 1925.<br>  <br>  This concentric ring model depicts urban land use in concentric rings: the Central Business District (or CBD) was in the middle of the model, and the city expanded in rings with different land uses. It contrasts with the Homer Hoyt's sector model and the multiple nuclei model.<br>  <br>  The sector model also known as the Hoyt model was proposed in 1939 by economist Homer Hoyt. It is a model of urban land use and modified the concentric zone model of city development.<br>  <br>  While accepting the existence of a central business district, Hoyt suggested that zones expand outward from the city center along railroads, highways, and other transportation arteries.<br>  <br>  In developing this model Hoyt observed that it was common for low-income households to be near railroad lines, and commercial establishments to be along business thoroughfares. Recognizing that the various transportation routes into an urban area, including railroads, sea ports, and tram lines, represented greater access, Hoyt theorized that cities tended to grow in wedge-shaped patterns -- or sectors -- emanating from the central business district and centered on major transportation routes.<br>  <br>  <br>  See the links below for additional information.

CYtMRC4eaa	A simple explanation is that hiccups are spasms of the diaphragm.  They can be caused by over-stimulation of the branch of the splanchnic nerve that innervates the diaphragm, but are more commonly caused by stimulation of the diaphragm itself, like after a huge meal, when the stomach presses on it.|`|InoTLoBMaa	A hiccup or hiccough (normally pronounced "HICK-up"; IPA: /?h?k?p/), is the spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating the "hic"  noise. In medicine, it is known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus.<br>  <br>  The term "hiccup" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern.<br>  <br>  List of possible causes of hiccup (singultus):<br>  <br>  Carbonated beverages <br>  Lack of water <br>  Eating too fast <br>  Being hungry for a while <br>  Taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal <br>  Burping <br>  Eating very hot or spicy food <br>  Laughing vigorously <br>  Coughing <br>  Drinking alcoholic beverages in excess <br>  Crying out loud (sobbing causes air to enter the stomach) <br>  Some smoking situations where abnormal inhalation can occur (in tobacco or other smoke like cannabis, perhaps triggered by precursors to coughing) <br>  Electrolyte imbalance <br>  Talking for too long <br>  Clearing the throat <br>  Use of some of the stronger opiate/opioid painkillers such as heroin, morphine, methadone and oxycodone <br>  Lack of vitamins <br>  Overstretching of the neck <br>  Laryngitis <br>  Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux) <br>  Sensation that there is food in the esophagus <br>  Irritation of the eardrum (which is innervated by the vagus nerve) <br>  Pressure to the phrenic nerve <br>  Chemotherapy <br>  General anesthesia <br>  Surgery <br>  Bloating <br>  Tumor <br>  Infection <br>  Diabetes <br>  Standing up too fast <br>  Vomiting <br>  Seizure <br>  Lack of Oxygen <br>  Drinking Soda|`|VRSUyeqbaa	it happens when you swallow air while drinking or talking|`|saqIaJlOaa	if you dont drink water for like a hour or 20 min|`|jjkikyZFaa	it is a spasm of the diaphragm|`|NIb8zWEHaa	Hiccups   occur when a spasm contracts the diaphragm, a large sheet of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. This spasm causes an intake of breath that is suddenly stopped by the closure of the vocal cords (glottis). This closure causes the characteristic "hiccup" sound.<br>  <br>  What causes hiccups?<br>  A very full stomach can cause bouts of hiccups that go away on their own. A full stomach can be caused by:<br>  <br>  Eating too much food too quickly.<br>  Drinking too much alcohol.<br>  Swallowing too much air.<br>  Smoking.<br>  A sudden change in stomach temperature, such as drinking a hot beverage and then a cold beverage.<br>  Emotional stress or excitement.<br>  How long do hiccups last?<br>  Hiccups usually stop within a few minutes to a few hours.<br>  <br>  Hiccups that last longer than 48 hours are called persistent hiccups. Hiccups that last longer than a month are called intractable hiccups. While very rare, intractable hiccups can cause exhaustion, lack of sleep, and weight loss. Both persistent and intractable hiccups may be a sign of a more serious health problem and must be checked by a doctor.<br>  <br>  There are many known causes of persistent or intractable hiccups, including:<br>  <br>  Central nervous system problems, such as cancer, infections, stroke, or injury.<br>  Problems with the chemical processes that take place in the body (metabolic problems), such as decreased kidney function or hyperventilation.<br>  Irritation of the nerves in the head, neck, and chest (vagus or phrenic nerve).<br>  Anesthesia or surgery.<br>  Mental health problems.<br>  How are hiccups treated?<br>  Most bouts of hiccups go away on their own within a few minutes to a few hours and do not require any treatment.<br>  <br>  Many home remedies are used to treat hiccups. Most of them involve increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which usually stops hiccups. Some of these remedies include:<br>  <br>  Holding your breath and counting slowly to 10.<br>  Breathing repeatedly into a paper bag for a limited period of time.<br>  Quickly drinking a glass of cold water.<br>  Eating a teaspoon of sugar or honey.<br>  The treatment for persistent or intractable hiccups depends on the underlying cause of the hiccups and may range from medicine to acupuncture or hypnosis. Sometimes several treatments may be tried before persistent or intractable hiccups are controlled. If you have hiccups that last a few days or longer, your doctor may conduct tests to rule out a more serious problem.<br>  <br>  Who is affected by hiccups?<br>  Hiccups affect males more often than females. Hiccups occur in practically every human being, including babies and older adults.

6KaMW1Vzaa	There are very few circumstances in which diuretics are indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, but they do exist. However, you've started out on a wrong path: hyponatremia is also almost never because of a loss of sodium, and when it is, diuretics aren't indicated. In general, when you approach the subject of hyponatremia, one of your first decisions is deciding whether the patient is dehydrated or overhydrated, and you'd be surprised how many people with hyponatremia have it because of a retention of free water in excess of sodium, without an overall decrease in total body sodium.<br>  By the way, the answer about SIADH is wrong: diuretics aren't part of the treatment of that syndrome. The places you'll see diuretics used will be special areas like nephrotic syndrome, where diuretics are only a part of, and not the primary, treatment.|`|12272f49d6c0da0443855ea3602a455caa	For syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone they are appropriate as they alter osmolality.

InoTLoBMaa	Acid rain is rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic. It has harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals, and infrastructure. Acid rain is mostly caused by human emissions of sulfur and nitrogen compounds which react in the atmosphere to produce acids. In recent years, many governments have introduced laws to reduce these emissions.<br>  <br>  Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pHs and are killed.The enzymes of these microbes are denatured (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize toxins, e.g. aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals.<br>  <br>  2H+ (aq)+ Mg2+ (clay) 2H+ (clay)+ Mg2+(aq) <br>  Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as sugar maple (Acer saccharum).<br>  <br>  Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.<br>  <br>  Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death|`|k82Intj3aa	Frankly, you're better off reading it here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#Surface_waters_and_aquatic_animals" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain#S...</a>|`|zf6mknuRaa	Most (if not every) plant/animal life becomes accustomed to living in an environment with a particular pH, if there's enough acid rain to significantly alter the pH of the environment (in this case, the sea) then there's a good chance they'll die.<br>  <br>  For instance, one problem with pine forest plantations is their leaves (needles?) are very acidic, so when the forest is cut down the soil is left with a very low pH, and it's very hard to get anything else to grow there.

Electrolysis of a hydrogen containing compound (like water)<br>  <br>  Numbers 1 and 2 are easy to do, however they have their cons. For example, the reaction will occur very quickly and you will end up with a lot of gas, however, most of that gas will not be hydrogen. Instead it will be highly corrosive hydrogen chloride gas (if you used hydrochloric acid) with only a some hydrogen gas in it. Overall, this would not be very flammable. These reactions are also exothermic, which means they release heat as they react. This heat can rise above 90 degrees celsius and possibly damage something if you are not using good quality laboratory glassware. You would also not be able to let go of the filled balloon and see it rise to the ceiling because there is just not enough hydrogen in the balloon and too much gas that is denser than the hydrogen. <br>  <br>  Number 3 is a very difficult experiment, yet the hydrogen gas produced could be over 99% pure. Because electrolysis of water produces both hydrogen and oxygen in a 2 to 1 ratio, you could collect both of these gases in the balloon which would make it very flammable. This experiment would take several hours to just produce one liter of flammable gas. Of course if you increased the size of your electrolysis vessel, you could produce much more gas.

InoTLoBMaa	Chromatography (from Greek χρ?μα:chroma, color and γραφειν:graphein to write) is the collective term for a family of laboratory techniques for the separation of mixtures. It involves passing a mixture dissolved in a "mobile phase" through a stationary phase, which separates the analyte to be measured from other molecules in the mixture and allows it to be isolated.<br>  <br>  Chromatography may be preparative or analytical. Preparative chromatography seeks to separate the components of a mixture for further use (and is thus a form of purification). Analytical chromatography normally operates with smaller amounts of material and seeks to measure the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>  Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.<br>  <br>  In 1978, W. C. Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called flash column chromatography (flash).The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.<br>  <br>  A spreadsheet that assists in the successful development of flash columns has been developed. The spreadsheet estimates the retention volume and band volume of analytes, the fraction numbers expected to contain each analyte, and the resolution between adjacent peaks. This information allows users to select optimal parameters for preparative-scale separations before the flash column itself is attempted.<br>  <br>  In expanded bed adsorption, a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.<br>  <br>  PAPER CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>  Paper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a jar containing a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.<br>  <br>  THIN LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>  Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely-employed laboratory technique and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantitation, high-performance TLC can be used.<br>  <br>  PLANAR CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>  Planar chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed (paper chromatography) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate (thin layer chromatography). Different compounds in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase . The specific Retardation factor (Rf) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.

GASTNilgaa	Everything you have written up to the point "but X is only an element" makes perfect sense and is correct.  (If your purpose was to calculate the set {X intersect A: X in P(C)}, you left out a few calculations: for example that {1,2,3} intersect A is {1,2}, that {1,3} intersect A is {1}, that {2,3} intersect A is {2}, and that {3} intersect A is the empty set.)  All of it makes sense.<br>  <br>  "But X is only an element not all the elements" makes no sense.  What is X here?  (The previous lines make perfect sense because they each tell me what X is; this line doesn't.)  What distinction is being made between "only an element" versus "all the elements"?  What does this have to do with the problem?  To disprove the set equality R = S, you need to do two things:<br>  <br>  (1) Show that R is not a subset of S by exhibiting a specific element of R and a proof that it is not an element of S.<br>  (2) Show that S is not a subset of R by exhibiting a specific element of S and a proof that it is not an element of R.<br>  <br>  Taking R = P(A) and S = {X intersect A: X in P(C)}, these goals become<br>  <br>  (1) Exhibit a specific subset S of A and a proof that no subset X of C satisfies X intersect A = S.<br>  (2) Exhibit a specific subset X of C and a proof that X intersect A is not a subset of A.<br>  <br>  If you haven't done (1) or (2), you haven't proved that the sets aren't equal.  (In fact, your calculations are almost all of what you would need for an explicit proof that the sets _are_ equal.)<br>  <br>  In fact you can't disprove the statement with one example because the general statement is true.  How do you prove it?<br>  <br>  (1) Show that every subset of A has the form "A intersect X" for some subset X of C.  (Not too hard: if S is a subset of A, it is also a subset of S, and S = A intersect S.)<br>  (2) Show that every set of the form "A intersect X," with X a subset of A, is a subset of A.  (This is simple also: [any set] intersect A is a subset of A.)<br>  <br>  What you might have been troubled by is the fact that any element of P(A) is actually of the form "A intersect X" for _several_ different elements of P(C).  For example the subset {1} of A is A intersect {1}, and it is also A intersect {1,3}; or the empty subset of A is A intersect emptyset, and it is also A intersect {3}.  These statements, while true, have nothing to do with the equality of the sets P(A) and {A intersect X: X in P(C)}.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped

Amateur astronomers have discovered powerful supernovae, gorgeous comets, planets orbiting other stars, and many of the same things the professionals have.  There are far more amateur astronomers than professionals, looking at far more of the sky at any one time, and the quality of amateur equipment is good enough that the major difference between well-equipped amateurs and professionals is whether or not they get paid for their telescope time.
GgClh7dbaa	Unconvincing.<br>  <br>  Like most people, I'm not qualified to validate or debunk the claims of Godel's critics. But an awful lot of other people are, and until at least a sizable chunk of the mathematical community vets these claims, you have to remain deeply skeptical.<br>  <br>  I have read G?del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter, which makes the case for the incompleteness theorem. It is understandable to lay people like me, and you might like to read it yourself.<br>  <br>  I looked at your link. I am also not qualified to evaluate it properly. But I was unimpressed by what I read, which was simply repeating over and over that G?del's work was invalid because it uses an invalid premise.<br>  <br>  Also, I was deeply unimpressed by comments like the one at the top of page 3, "A case study in the view that all views end in meaninglessness." LOL. Are they serious? All views? Like the one they're expressing? By the way, how about a subject to go with this predicate. That's not even a sentence. <br>  <br>  And what follows is no better. The next sentence, besides beginning with an unnecessary word ("As"), is nonsense: "As an example of this is G?del's incompleteness theorem." G?del's incompleteness theorem is not a view, it is a mathematical theorem. <br>  <br>  Then comes this gem: "G?del is a complete failure as he ends in utter meaninglessness." Intelligent people don't write like this. You might say, "G?del's theorem is invalid because . . " but not G?del himself is a failure. No, a COMPLETE failure. And why is this man a complete failure, because his theorem is invalid? Worse. It ends (do theorems have an end?) in utter meaninglessness, the worst kind. LOL.<br>  <br>  When you write like this, it undermines your credibility. Throw this crap into the fireplace.|`|1da3bf2575e7b0729442de82450266caaa	True, it was later shown by Ramsey that it is unfounded, but in the same book, Foundations of Mathematics (1931), he also proved that it is not *needed*.<br>  <br>  Apparently the writer of those 61 pages didn't know that....<br>  <br>  Edit: not *needed* in G?del's proof: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%...</a>|`|nKCMRLysaa	That paper is just a rant. The author lists a long string of his qualifications, but they don't include any in mathematics.<br>  <br>  He shows his complete ignorance of mathematics early on, when he says "mathematicians are still disputing whether the axiom of choice is true or not". If he actually knew what an axiom was, and if he knew that the axiom of choice has been proved to be independent of the other axioms of elementary arithmetic, he would have realized he's talking complete garbage.<br>  <br>  I stopped reading it at that point. <br>  <br>  There is no doubt whatever among mathematicians that Godel's incompleteness theorems are correct, and a lot of work has been done to nail down exactly what it is about arithmetic that makes them correct, and to give alternative proofs many of which apply to more general systems than Godel's original paper, which was only concerned with the axiom system given in Russell and Whitehead's "Principia".
f1beDbKIaa	Sure.  But it's a long time.<br>  <br>  In 4 to 5 billion years (4x10^9) the Sun runs out of ready hydrogen fuel at the core and expands to a Red Giant.  After that, it shrinks to about the size of the Earth in a white dwarf phase.  At this point it's quite hot, but does not fuse anything anymore, so it just cools.  However, the surface area of the Earth is very small compared to the surface area that that Sun is now, so it stays hot for approximately a trillion years.  At some point, it's so cool that in visible wavelengths it's essentially black.  We call that a Black Dwarf.  The Universe isn't old enough to have any Black Dwarf stars at the moment.<br>  <br>  There isn't an event, like a supernova, that signals the end of the Sun.  That is unless it hits something else.<br>  |`|DOShS8q0aa	Yes the sun will give out but not for another four to five billion years. What will happen is the sun will run out of hydrogen in its core and it will have to fuse helium in order to keep burning. Thus with less energy the sun will cool and expand engulfing most of the terrestrial planets. Then when it gets to the point of fusing lead in its core it will collapse on itself and form a blue dwarf star but not before its nova has destroy the solar system|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Every star in this Universe eventually gives out, so will our Sun, in approximatelly 5 billion years.

f0b92abaf764442976b61fda75028f7caa	Es dificil de determinar, ya que el tiempo que transcurre desde que una gota de agua abandona la nube hasta que toca el suelo depende de muchos factores. Pero se puede hacer una aproximacion. En principio, sobre la gota actuan dos fuerzas: su peso y la resistencia al avance que opone la atmosfera. Esto es asi siempre que supongamos un escenario ideal en el que la gota sea esferica y indeformable, que la velocidad sea constante y que no sople el viento, para que la caida sea perpendicular al suelo. Con estas salvedades, Newton propuso una formula que permite calcular la velocidad de caida y por tanto el tiempo que t arda una gota en descender desde una nube situada a una altura concreta. Por ejemplo, una gota de 5 mm de diametro que cae desde 1800m de altura tarda en estrellarse sobre la tierra unos 4,5 min.<br>  a mayor velocidad, mayor será la resistencia aerodinamica y las gotas mayores caen mas rápido que las peque?as.<br>  En definitiva no es totalmente preciso.<br>  <br>  ???|`|aad6f0bd61c1c65cf569e8ba7eb0c7ceaa	1 minuto, depende de la fuerza de que salga de la nube|`|bb9f1cf9fd18d09adb24e377896d1701aa	Hola ?<br>  <br>  Depende de la altura que caiga, ten en cuenta los siguientes datos:<br>  <br>  *  La velocidad máxima a la que una gota de lluvia puede caer es de 28 km/h.<br>  <br>  *  Dados que las gotas de lluvia crecen a medida que caen, su área superficial aumenta y, por lo tanto, se incrementa la resistencia a su caída.

Or is each individual grain of sand in the Sahara Desert a non-living "thing"? Is a rock lying on the groud a non-living "thing"? Or is it just a small piece of a non-living "thing", the nearby mountain it broke off from?<br>  <br>  My point is that it is much harder to classify non-living matter into specific "things" than it is for living organisms.

Some people are just attracted to animals, the same way some are attracted to men, some to women, some to both, etc. I don't think it's to do with big penises - not all animals have large penises, and men who have sex with female animals obviously aren't thinking about penises. I don't think it's to do with not getting any from people, either - I mean, would you go and have sex with a dog or a horse or whatever if no humans wanted to do it with you? I certainly wouldn't! Animals are just what 'does it' for some people. There are people who are into all kinds of weird things, after all - for example, some find cars sexually attractive, and there's a woman who married the Berlin Wall!

6HDOG32Kaa	It's the transition between your waking consciousness and sleep, termed 'hypnagogia'. Don't worry about it-- in fact, consider yourself lucky: many people strive for this 'astral projection'. Everyone experiences this on a daily (or nightly, in this context) basis, but are just unaware of their body running the aforementioned visual and audio tests. If this continues, don't be frightened if you see blurry, distorted images and/or loud noises. <br>  <br>  P.S. you may experience sleep paralysis, a condition where you cannot move your body.

4ELJgnWbaa	the glass has a higher index of refraction (n) than the air in the bubble, when light goes from a material with a larger n to one with a smaller n, it refracts away from the normal, when the light exits the bubble it refracts back towards the normal, such that the light is exiting the bubble at the same angle as it entered the bubble, this means that the light rays aren't convergent anywhere on the other side of the bubble as the light source, this is the same as a concave (diverging) lens

The Moon is the only celestial body to which humans have travelled and upon which humans have performed a manned landing. The Moon will most likely be the first location of the permanent outpost for humans in the outer space, providing a base for interplanetary travel, research and for many other purposes.<br>  <br>  While it would be relatively easy to resupply a lunar base from Earth, in comparison to a Martian base, the Moon is likely to play a large role in the development of long-duration closed-loop life support systems. Duplicating the ecology of Earth so that wastes can be recycled is essential to any long term effort of space exploration.

p6ddcjxCaa	My friends and I just finished our design for a school that is located on a farm, in Redlands Ca. In my opinion the design was awesome. I can't wait to get it started. The overall process was actually pretty fun. We used the basic Permaculture principals, with observation first to design the whole thing. I didn't really see any problems, because in permaculture the problem is the solution. So we turned most of our problems into productive ideas, but I'd say time is always the problem.<br>  The advantages of our design is the children at the school were using, are going to grow up learning an effective way to spend their resources and manage their waste. They also are going to be able to generate an abundant amount of income, while having the resources to live off their own land efficiently
YPGsPRtPaa	I recently took a week long intro to permaculture and forest gardening course and it was fantastic. I learned more in a week than I have an entire semester at college. It was so good i signed up for a three week permaculture design course in May. I highly recommend reading PERMACULTURE: A Designers' Manual by bill mollison. The benefits of a permaculture education are numerous and range from the knowledge of self sufficiency to in depth understanding of complex ecological processes.

The sides of a triangle that come together at a vertex form an angle. This angle is called the interior angle. In the picture below, the angles a, b and c are the three interior angles of the triangle. An exterior angle is formed by extending one of the sides of the triangle; the angle between the extended side and the other side is the exterior angle. In the picture, angle d is an exterior angle.<br>  <br>  The exterior angle theorem says that the size of an exterior angle at a vertex of a triangle equals the sum of the sizes of the interior angles at the other two vertices of the triangle. So, in the picture, the size of angle d equals the size of angle a plus the size of angle c.

1i6aF5Tdaa	I went with a 8" Zhumell about 2 years ago, mainly because it was so less expensive than the Orion. The Zhumell is almost all GSO made (Taiwan), and good quality. There are only 2 firms that manufacture all the big company's tube Dobs, and they are about the same in quality. You will have an advantage over me, because the new Zhumell mount is superior to mine, which did not have ajustable tension and has had some issues (albiet small and easy to fix). Truely, save your money and put it towards a good widefield 2" E.P., like a 32mm meade 5000 plossl ($150 new, about 100 used), or a more expensive Televue Panoptic or Nagler.

Easy to pick up and add later for the Orion.  Some people prefer a red dot or Telrad finder.  I'm not one of them.  The Orion has a 1200 mm focal length, where the Zhumell is 1250.  Now, you might think that 50 mm makes no difference.  But the Orion fits across the back seat of my car without much extra room.  That would make me a bit nervous. But it's not the focal length, but the tube length that matters.  They're related, but not identical.<br>  <br>  I'd go with the Orion, mostly because i have prior experience with the company, and can say first hand that their after sales support is excellent.<br>  <br>  But what i bought was the xt10i.  That is, the xt10 with the computer.  Unfortunately, the xt10 is not upgradeable to the xt10i.  They give you a different mount.  The xt10i is $700.  But they give you a 9x50 finder scope too.

Why a 6-inch F/8 Refractor, regardless of who builds it. From my years of experience as an astronomer who has used a variety of telescopes of different types along with using very rare large apertures of 8-12 inches. I have found the 6 inch F/8 refracting telescope is the optimum design for lunar, planetary, and solar observing. The telescope’s size makes it the best instrument in my opinion for advanced observers to use and simple enough for elementary observers to use for their viewing. An observer can master the telescope system with relatively few instructions, and yet the system is large enough to provide optimum viewing in city astmospheric conditions. Furthermore for more advanced observing the 6" F/8 refractor with it’s accessories provides opportunities for photographic and spectroscopic work as well. Observatories and educational institutions usually have found the 6-inch F/8 refractor to be the finest instrument for deep-sky, lunar, planetary, and solar observing.

The microtubule spindles pull the chromosomes apart.|`|i4ThsyUCaa	The microtubule spindle, or spindle fibres, are tiny tube-like structures made of protein that form in prophase during mitosis in the cell cycle, and stretch across the cell from centrioles (organelles that "organize" spindle fibres during mitosis) to attach to the centromeres of the chromosomes. In metaphase, the spindle fibres pulls the X-shaped chromosomes into a single line across the middle of the cell, and in anaphase, they contract and shorten, pulling the centromere apart, allowing halves of the chromosomes, aka sister chromatids, to separate.
lMN59lv2aa	The answer is (D); Chromatin is the combination of DNA and associated proteins.<br>  <br>  The "associated proteins" in this case are histones, which form octomers around which DNA wraps. The octomers themselves are organized into a spiral shape, creating a 30-nm chromatin fiber. These fibers themselves are further compacted around a "scaffold" of non-histone proteins.<br>  <br>  The result is that a DNA molecule that may be almost a meter long is compacted into a chromosome that is only around 8 μm in length.<br>  <br>  Chromatin (with an N) should not be confused with chromatids (with a D), which would be answer (B) above.

HTmj2BXDaa	Paul P is right although his explanation is a little off.  Most chemical reactions do go faster the higher the temperature.  All atoms and molecules are moving all the time (unless they are cooled to absolute zero).  So increasing the temperature causes them to move faster and that increases most chemical reactions.  It is technically correct to say that most things expand when heated and, in the case of an iron nail, as the nail heats up, it expands.  Because Fe is able to expand without cracking but Fe oxide is not, increasing the temperature (or changing the temperature up or down) creates cracks in the Fe oxide which uncovers fresh Fe to oxidize.  The reason most steels have to be protected from corrosion is that Fe oxides (there are 3 types, FeO, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4) are not very strong so they crack and break off and allow more corrosion.  Stainless steels and other metals form oxides that stick really well so, once they form they prevent any further oxidation.  Other things that increase with increasing temperature include chemical solubility and diffusion rates.  Hope this helps|`|Ozw47krzaa	Heat speeds up almost all chemical reactions as the heat makes molecules move slightly.. (hence expanding) This creates more collisions between the different molecules. In this case the Iron molecules and the Oxygen molecules... If you move around in circles your far more likely to bump into someone :P This is the same for the molecules. You could also argue that as the Iron expands it provides more surface area. More surface area and moving molecules = more bonds!   o-fe-o  Think of it like making a cup of tea...

An ionic compound is a compound whose molecule is formed by the chemical combination of a positive ion (cation) with a negative ion (anion). For example, a sodium ion with a +1 charge combines with a chloride ion with a -1 charge to produce a neutrally charged molecule of the ionic compound sodium chloride.

Its very nature is entwined with his culture, lifestyle, and character.<br>  <br>  In Philippine mythology, the origin of the first Filipinos came about after a small bird pecked on a large bamboo trunk until it cracked wide open in the middle where a man called Malakas (Strong) and a woman called Maganda (Beautiful) emerged. Unlike the story of Adam and Eve where the latter was formed out of Adam's rib, the Filipino creation myth highlights the importance of both man and woman being born out of one source, different from yet equal to each other.<br>  <br>  In the face of typhoon winds or crisis, the Filipino, like the bamboo bends back without breaking, exhibiting a resiliency as a race.

A curve in space implies a change in direction.  A curve in space-time implies a change in speed, since velocity is a function of both space and time.  Gravity is therefore a space-time curvature in the way that objects accelerate in a gravitational field.  Acceleration traces a curve in space-time, whereas gravity is a curve in space-time itself, forcing all objests within it to follow that curve (making them accelerate)..

UFteXlqwaa	Having sailed all my life, I can see that this is partly true, at least for the sailor, i.e. at sea.<br>  <br>  Red sky with a low sun is observed when there is much moisture at the clouds' level. The sunlight is then absorbed by the humidity and we mostly see the lower frequency of the spectrum, i.e. the red one.<br>  <br>  But if the moisture is at all levels, like when it is hazy of foggy, then very little light reaches us so it has to be: moist air over dry one.<br>  <br>  That happens when the sun has warmed the sea during the day and moist air has been rising aloft. That happens also at the lee side of a mountain range; also a place where "red sky" is often observed when the air falling down the mountain warms up and dries out adiabatically.<br>  <br>  So, red sky at night is considered normal. But during the night the air near the surface cools down and the relative humidity is higher at the sea level than aloft. That's why we get morning dew and even morning fog, when an inversion happens.<br>  <br>  But if the sky is red in the morning, it could mean that a warm front is on its way. You are still in the cold sector, hence dryer air. But aloft, moisture from the warm sector has been lifted up the slope of the front.<br>  <br>  Then there is the other saying: "Mackerel skies and mare tails make tall ship carry little sail." So, if after a red sky morning, you see alto-cumulus (mackerel sky) and cirrus with their "tails" all in one direction, then you are certain that a low pressure with its warm front is moving in. Lower the sails, latch everything on deck and prepare some food and drink. The galley (boat's kitchen) is the last place you want to be in a storm!  ... been there, done that! :-)|`|pk9JbCE8aa	It is remarkably, very accurate.

Most storms tend to move from west to east, so a "red sky at night" often means that the setting sun is shining on the clouds from a storm moving off to the east.  Likewise, a "red sky at morning" is often caused by the rising sun lighting clouds approaching from the west.  It's not an absolute law, but it's common enough that the saying remains in use.|`|rQd7QuRcaa	It's true.. it has to do with dust in the atmosphere.. which is common sunset, but over night the dust settles and in the morning, the skies should be clear.

Farmers have an easier time working when there is daylight.  Other things like people driving to work in daylight hours instead of darkness making it safer were things add to the "list" later on.|`|Atm74ULtaa	Daylight Saving Time does not really save any daylight, it just shifts the amount of daylight from the morning to the evening so that people can enjoy more daylight at the end of the day, after they have come home from work or school. If you live near the equator, day and night are nearly the same length (12 hours) throughout the year. However, elsewhere on Earth, there is much more daylight in the summer than in the winter. The closer you live to the North or South Pole, the longer the period of daylight in the summer. Thus, Daylight Saving Time is usually not helpful in the tropics and so countries in this region generally do not change their clocks. This is probably why Arizona and Hawaii do not observe Daylight Saving Time.<br>  <br>  As for the "saving electricity" argument, I don't believe it because you may use less electricity in the evening, but you probably use more in the morning and so overall there is likely no savings.<br>  <br>  Why do we still have it? That's a great question, without an easy answer. The reason is probably because we have been doing it so long that it's hard to stop now. As the saying goes, it's hard to stop a juggernaut. However, maybe one day we will get rid of Daylight Saving Time.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to adjust your clock tonight!<br>  <br>  :-)|`|J3TGyOnDaa	Daylight saving started during World War II as a form of psychological warfare.

lMN59lv2aa	In terms of phenotype, the answer is (almost always) yes.<br>  <br>  The Y-chromosome includes the gene SRY (sometimes also called TDF or Testes Determining Factor). The presence of this gene causes the gonads to develop as testicles. Once the testicles develop, they begin producing high levels of testosterone, which directs the development of secondary sexual characteristics.<br>  <br>  There are a number of nondisjunction genetic disorders, however, that can cause unusual sex chromosomes. In Klinefelter syndrome, for example, a phenotypic male may have as many as 5 X-chromosomes. People with Klinefelter develop male genetalia, but they tend to have low fertility, feminine voices, and sometimes developed breasts. Klinefelter is more common than you might think, occuring in one out of every 500 male births.<br>  <br>  It is possible that a mutation in the SRY gene could result in no functional gene product. This would most likely be a lethal mutation, but in extremely rare cases, it is possible to have both a non-functional SRY and Klinefelter syndrome. Such embryos would develop as probably infertile females. Such an individual would have an XXY karyotype.|`|8f592156315459070d71ebb56042dc31aa	No. It also depends a lot on the hormones. Intersexuals tend to have these things mixed up a bit.<br>  <br>  If a child is born with male genitalia and has XX chromosomes than the doctors usually change inter-sexual child into a girl. And if a child is born with female genitalia and has a Y chromosome than they give it a suitable penis to become a boy. They're all of course on hormonal therapy as well.<br>  <br>  But chochromosomese just from biological sex. We all know that a great deal in determing if a person is a boy or girl is also gender's fault. And some theorists say that biological sex is somewhat gender. When we are born, parents usually put boys in blue and girls in pink. Also the girls are told how pretty and gentle... they are. The boys on the other hand are told how tough and strong they are.<br>  <br>  And if you look at transsexuals you can also see that you are not defdefinitelyboy if you are born with a Y chromosome. Transsexuals in general feel like they're the wrong sex. Thus men feel like they're actually women and vice versa. They all feel which gender they are although their biological sex is different. And usually they change their sex with surgery and hormonal therapy.|`|ZFUvQUk5aa	If you have a xx chromosome you're a girl and if you have a xy choromosme ,then you're a boy|`|8y72SEoLaa	some hermaphrodites have both|`|kfuUL88Raa	Well, the sex of an individual actually depends on a small gene inside the Y chromosome, which is called SRY, whene this gene is present the baby will evolve into a boy, when it is not, into a girl.<br>  <br>  However, there can be difficulties.

AA10818712	The author you cite clearly does not understand G?del's proof. G?del showed that every system in which arithmetic is defined contains statements which that system is incapable of proving true or false. This is NOT to say that those statements are meaningless. It is to say that the system is incapable of demonstrating the truth or falsehood of those statements. This distinction is apparently lost on the author.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	>>what do you think?<br>  <br>  I think I've seen WAY too many people misuse the theorem for stupid philosophical reasons.  Especially here on Y!A.  So I have a hard time taking it seriously.|`|7lpS0h7Paa	In mathematical logic, a (formal) theory is a set of statements expressed in a particular formal language. Most theories of interest are infinite. Some statements in a theory are included without proof (these are the axioms of the theory), and others (the theorems) are included because they are implied by the axioms.<br>  <br>  Because statements of a formal theory are written in symbolic form, it is possible to mechanically verify that a formal proof from a finite set of axioms is valid. This task, known as automatic proof verification, is closely related to automated theorem proving; the difference is that instead of constructing a new proof, the proof verifier simply checks that a provided formal proof (or, in some cases, instructions that can be followed to create a formal proof) is correct. This is not merely hypothetical; systems such as Isabelle are used today to formalize proofs and then check their validity.<br>  <br>  Many theories of interest include an infinite set of axioms, however. In order to verify a formal proof when the set of axioms is infinite, it must be possible to determine whether a statement that is claimed to be an axiom is actually an axiom. This issue arises in first order theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic, because the principle of mathematical induction is expressed as an infinite set of axioms (an axiom schema).<br>  <br>  A formal theory is said to be effectively generated if its set of axioms is a recursively enumerable set. This means that there is a computer program that, in principle, could enumerate all the axioms of the theory without listing any statements that are not axioms. This is equivalent to the ability to enumerate all the theorems of the theory without enumerating any statements that are not theorems. For examples, each of the theories of Peano arithmetic and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory has an infinite number of axioms and each is effectively generated.<br>  <br>  In choosing a set of axioms, one goal is to be able to prove as many correct results as possible, without proving any incorrect results. A set of axioms is complete if, for any statement in the axioms' language, either that statement or its negation is provable from the axioms. A set of axioms is (simply) consistent if there is no statement so that both the statement and its negation are provable from the axioms. In the standard system of first-order logic, an inconsistent set of axioms will prove every statement in its language (this is sometimes called the principle of explosion), and is thus automatically complete. A set of axioms that is both complete and consistent, however, will prove as many theorems as can be proved without containing a contradiction.
2lQ8DJAcaa	Red foxes generally have a white belly and almost always have a white tipped tail, black ears and paws, called socks, are common. The red fox does have a wide range of possible colors. Some have a light grey color -- the light silver fox. One color phase that is prized is the black silver fox -- the fox is solid black with specks of white hair on the hind side and the typical white tip. Most Arctic foxes have a solid white fur color in winter -- however, some have a solid black or dark blue fur color in winter. These blue color phase foxes, called Blue Foxes, generally live along the coast. The Arctic fox's fur changes to dark brown in summer.|`|D2VcfTi4aa	I don't think that there is a species called the blue fox.  Its a name for a type of fur sold by furriers.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Crawfish, like shrimp or lobsters, belong to the scientific class Crustacea. Their hard outer shell, called the exoskeleton, does not grow with the crawfish and is shed periodically. In Louisiana, two species of crawfish -- the red swamp and the white river -- provide for the harvest. Crawfish are harvested from both wild habitats (natural rivers, bayous, swamps, and lakes) and controlled, managed crawfish farms. Harvest takes place from November through June, with baited wire-mesh traps. Traps are checked daily, and the catch is packed into 50 lb. onion sacks for delivery to processors. Only the tail meat is recovered from processing. The claw meat is tasty but very meager and difficult to pick out. Tail meat can be purchased fresh or frozen, with prices varying with the time of season and supply.<br>  <br>  Both species of crawfish occur naturally in the Mid-Atlantic region, but crawfish farming is a very recent development here. Small, shallow ponds have been stocked with red swamp crawfish and are managed for commercial production. The harvest takes place during spring and summer, coinciding with the tourist season. Production is still very limited, but there is considerable interest in exploring the potential of crawfish farming as an alternative crop.<br>  <br>  Crawfish can be purchased whole and fresh, raw or pre-cooked, for immediate use of for your own crawfish boil. If you purchase whole, fresh crawfish, make sure they are alive. Dead crawfish decompose rapidly, resulting in mush, discolored meat.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish</a>

0r06xEiVaa	There was no matter at the beginning of the Big Bang.  There was only energy; matter actually condenses out of light, according to the theory (this is where the equivalence of energy and matter comes in).    <br>  <br>  The human mind believes in ordinary causality.  There has to be a beginning.  Any effect, such as what we see, must have a cause.  <br>  <br>  So here are your options.<br>  <br>  1.  You can attribute the beginning of the universe to God.  The unexplainable problem here is what caused God.  To say that God always is/was/will be, is really no different than #2.  You've got to posit that there is this someone/something that has no cause and is forever.  That's an effect (God) with no cause.<br>  <br>  2.  You can say the universe has always been.  This could be in the sense that Hoyle said, that is, that the universe we see has been around forever, and will always be around forever.   Now you have to imagine all this stuff as always having been around (stars, galaxies, worlds, comets, planets, etc.) without anything ever having caused it.  So now you have eternally-existing matter instead of eternally-existing God.  Eternally existing matter is just as incomprehensible, in terms of cause and effect, as eternally existing God.  This is an effect (matter, the universe) with no cause.  Incidentally, in the latest issue of Astronomy there is a theory of the universe as endlessly cycling through decay and big-bang regeneration in a trillion year cycle.  That's an always-existing thing with no beginning too.<br>  <br>  3.  So 1 and 2 are both effects without a cause.  Now, you can have a cause with no prior effect.  That's what Big Bang is.   There was no space and no time; the creation of matter, energy, space, and time, are all linked to the same event, the Big Bang.  Asking about the "before" doesn't exactly make sense because time itself is part of the moment of creation; there is no time, and no before-ness, until the universe is created.    If you want to say God did it or that there is a trillion year cycle then you can go back to #1 and #2.<br>  <br>  In each case, what you do is you run up against something that is incomprehensible.  #1 offers an incomprehensible being that has no cause.  #2 offers an incomprehensibly vast and forever expanse of always was, is, and will be.  #3 offers an incomprehensible event that can have no cause because time itself doesn't even exist before the universe is created.<br>  <br>  Now if you want to distinguish these views, as science, from pure belief, the answer is that science gathers data.  We have learned a lot about how time, space, and gravity interact in the past century.   We have collected data about an energy background in the universe that is consistent with the big bang.  So at least some of the theorizing is informed by data collection, and tests are made of the theories.   That's what distinguishes the science from the religious faith: we have a certain distribution of galaxies, for example, in the observed universe, so we can tie that distribution into other data and propose a theory that accounts for the known facts. <br>  <br>  BUT, when all is said and done, these forces, whether due to "nature" or some all-powerful being, are all well beyond our powers of comprehension.|`|FT4mVJMzaa	There is absolutely no accepted scientific theory that claims to be a theory of origins.

In fact, most theoretical physicists and cosmologists think that there WAS indeed a supernatural force behind it because by all accounts the creation of the universe does not scientifically make sense because, like a black hole, all of physics and everything we know cannot explain it.

b20518aff8ed05a57be53803c67262afaa	Hi Darl, The Earth's Crust Is Made Up Of Tectonic Plates Which Can Move Together And Rub Against Each Other Either Like Rubbing Your Hands Together Which Will Be Felt As An Earth Tremor. The Other Kind Which Usually Causes More Damage Is Where One Plate Is Pushed Up Against Another Which Doesn't Move. Instead The Moving Plate Rises Up And Causes More Friction Like If You Put Both Hands Face Down On The Table Keeping One Still While Trying To Push It With The Other. A Sudden Movement Of A Plate Under The Ocean Would Be Like A Giant Wave Machine Pushing Vast Amounts Of Water In Front Of It Causing A Tsunami.<br>  I Don't Know How Clear That Is Darl But It's Not As Easy As I Thought To Put Into Words.

A tsunami is caused by an earthquake that has happened under the sea.|`|e7yFahGraa	A really simple way to put it is there are things called tectonic plates, and they move.

2OQuDVYvaa	It is the process of injecting a fluid or medicine into the rectum.  Mostly used for treatment of severe constipation or fecal impaction; but, also used by some for other reasons (alternative medicial practices or erotic stimulation). <br>  <br>  There are different types of enemas.  Most of the advice posted for you so far is based around using a disposable saline enema.  Those are chemicals that are designed to draw moisture into the rectum.  I personally do not care for them.<br>  <br>  Another choice is a large volume tap water enema (1 to 2 quarts or more).  You can buy a either a fountain syringe or combination hot water bottle/douche/enema which are typically found near the feminine hygiene section in the pharmacy.  (Do not use the same bag for douching as you use for enemas.)  <br>  <br>  For a tap water enema you should use warm (not hot) water with a teaspoon of salt per quart. Lay on your left side with the right knee drawn to your chest (sims position). The bag should be hanging 18"-24" above the point of insertions (your anus). Be sure to open the clamp and let the air out of the tube before inserting in your anus. Open up and let it flow slowly. If you begin to cramp, stop and pant like a puppy until the cramps subside. The open the clamp again. Continue until you have taken at least 1/3 of the bag. Roll to your back (or stomach), open the clamp and take another 1/3 of the bag. Finally roll to your right side and finish the bag. Roll onto your back again and lay there retaining it. Panting helps with the cramps and massaging the abdomen helps you retain the enema. You can do this by yourself; but, having a close friend give it to you may provide an enjoyable experience.    <br>  <br>  Sometimes fecal matter in the rectum creates pressure and you may have to stop and expel the waste. After that start over.|`|2WUKnRQyaa	an enema is a solution that is inserted through the anus (i know gross right) it is used for cleaning a person out if they need testing done or to help with constipation. it normally doesnt hurt, but you may have some cramping afterwards. if you were to use one at home yourself, i would sit on the toilet and do it, can be messy and you will need to empty pretty fast.|`|z0torDIWaa	It is a medicine like thing that is inserted into the, well, but crack to be used when you cannot go to the bathroom...<br>  It is done through a dropper-like object and can be performed alone but it is best to have someone do it for you, awkward as it may be, to ensure that the fluid is squeezed in correctly.

When we want to induce fission in heavy nuclides, we send a thermal neutron into them. As they're thermal, they're likely to be absorbed thus creating a heavier less stable nucleus.

cWuumdy7aa	In 1965, Jane earned her Ph.D in Ethology from Cambridge University. Soon thereafter, she returned to Tanzania to continue research and to establish the Gombe Stream Research Centre.<br>  <br>  It is hard to overstate the degree to which Dr. Goodall changed and enriched the field of primatology. She defied scientific convention by giving the Gombe chimps names instead of numbers, and insisted on the validity of her observations that animals have distinct personalities, minds and emotions. She wrote of lasting chimpanzee family relationships. <br>  <br>  Through the years her work continued to yield surprising insights, such as the unsettling discovery that chimpanzees engage in a primitive form of brutal “warfare.” In early 1974, a "four-year war" began at Gombe, the first record of long-term warfare in nonhuman primates. Members of the Kasakela group systematically annihilated members of the "Kahama" splinter group. <br>  <br>  Dr. Goodall would also chart surprising courtship patterns in which males force females onto consortships in remote spots for days or even months. And she and her field staff in 1987 would observe adolescent Spindle "adopt" three-year-old orphan Mel, even though the infant was not a close relative. <br>  <br>  The Jane Goodall Institute<br>  <br>  In 1977, Jane founded the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education and Conservation to provide ongoing support for field research on wild chimpanzees. Today, the mission of the Jane Goodall Institute is to advance the power of individuals to take informed and compassionate action to improve the environment for all living things. The Institute is a leader in the effort to protect chimpanzees and their habitats and is widely recognized for establishing innovative community-centered conservation and development programs in Africa and the Roots & Shoots education program in nearly 100 countries.|`|sJXjzgh5aa	she's the one that chilled with the chimps for like 5 years yeah?

Wasting water, whether it's through leaky pipes or hosing down your driveway every day, makes the effects worse simply by reducing the amount of water available.<br>  <br>  The drought situation in California right now may be the worst in over 30 years.

Hence the diagonal across one of the faces of the cube (not across the whole cube) is going to be root(s^2 + s^2)  or root(2s^2)  by the Pythagorean theorem.  Then take that squared plus one of the sides of the dimension you haven't used yet squared and you'll find the whole diagonal of the cube.  Say you first found length squared plus height squared.  you'll then have to use that plus width squared to cross the third dimension of the cube.  Thus, you'll have root(root(2s^2)^2 + s^2).  This simplifies out to root(2s^2 + s^2) which is root(3s^2).

In short, every prediction of doomsday in 2012 is unscientific garbage without a shred of evidence to support it.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	'Some people' don't think very much.<br>  2012 is the end of a long period in that old calender.<br>  That's all.<br>  They even predicted events which were to occur after the <br>  'turning of the page'.|`|De4vgWXPaa	The Mayans completely failed to predict the end of the world for 2012.

Please, name one scientist that has supported this. I dare you.<br>  <br>  Yes, the Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is real. It does not end, because it is circular<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=aztec+..." rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=aztec+...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.azteccalendar.com/azteccalend..." rel="nofollow">http://www.azteccalendar.com/azteccalend...</a><br>  <br>  The Aztecs conquered the Mayans and absorbed the Mayan culture. There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.

kfuUL88Raa	If you are referring to the chromosomes that look like two V's attached to each other, it is because the cells puts them that way, when the cell wants to duplicate itself and the double V structure is best for it, since one chromosome in this structure consists of two identical molecules of DNA, which can then easily be seperated , especially for meiosis, since it can come to crossing over ,which is great for natural variety. <br>  <br>  When the cell is not duplicating itself "chromosomes" look like unarranged strings of wire which fill up the cells nucleus, commonly known as chromatin.|`|AA10467858	Depends upon what features of the chromosome you are talking about...<br>  <br>  The chromosome in constricted in the centre because of the centromere that is necessary for getting them attached to spindle fibres during cell division...<br>  <br>  They have chromatids because chromatids are necessary for crossing over of genetic material...<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your question...

If so, it is to detect if there are any genetic faults such as aneuploidy or transposition of parts of the chromosome via flourescent in situ hybridization know as FISH. Staining allows us to see which parts of the chromosome are readable by the replisome, due to readable DNA being less condensed.<br>  <br>    If however you are talking about on a smaller level such as looking at the genetic make up of the chromatid, then this will be because the reading of the code will show which chromosome it is, if any mutations have occurred in it and if loss of heterozygosity has taken place.

qgBF1xk6aa	To save the earth, study hard. Learn enough science and math to be able to tell when ideas about saving the earth are true, false, or just someone's opinion. You must also learn about economics, so that you can figure out the real-world impact of your actions in terms of costs. <br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do is to learn how to think critically. <br>  <br>  For example, some people may urge you to not drive your car. Sounds like a great idea. But if you need to drive to get to work or school, assuming you're far away and the weather isn't always nice enough to walk or ride a bicycle, and if there isn't public transportation (not always environmentally friendly anyway), that's not a practical idea. <br>  Ask yourself: What are you really accomplishing for the environment by not driving? True, using less gasoline means that less fuel will be burned and that will reduce the emissions going into the atmosphere, but by a tiny amount. Meanwhile, if enough people stop driving, the demand for gasoline will decrease, so the suppliers of gasoline will cut back on the amount they produce. That means that the price of gasoline will go up, so when you have to drive, it will cost you even more. In addition, consider that a car that sits unused for a long time will suffer--tires will dry out, the battery will discharge, corrosion will take place around the battery, inside the engine and in the exhaust system. That will lead to repair and replacement costs that you will have to pay. See what I mean? It's not so easy figuring out the real-world effects of what seems like a simple answer.|`|ZTbrnMFJaa	by the way  today if someone having concern for the earth can be considered something great .<br>  GOOD U DO HAVE CONCERN<br>  daily whatever u use ,see to it that it is fruitful and that u  wont waste any resource on a large scale until unless it is inevitable<br>  Hope the earth lives for ages<br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|pkSB2UAVaa	Avoid using plastic bags.|`|ZNO2fG5uaa	i think using our natural resources properly and limitedly and even if possible try to re use from the used one. so by this way we are saving the resources of our earth.<br>  <br>  for example water,eletricpower etc...........|`|Ru3PBiAbaa	Plant a tree and water it.<br>  <br>  Do not use vehicles when not needed.<br>  <br>  Keep your vehicle's emission level as recommended.

Ftkr9jqYaa	THIN LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>  <br>  This page is an introduction to chromatography using thin layer chromatography as an example. Although if you are a beginner you may be more familiar with paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography is equally easy to describe and more straightforward to explain.<br>   <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Note:  I'm taking a simple view of the way that thin layer chromatography works in terms of adsorption (see below) which should be adequate for students doing courses for 16 - 18 year olds. The reality is more complicated and the explanation will vary depending on what sort of solvent or solvent mixture you are using. Some similar problems are discussed on the page about paper chromatography, but I am unwilling to do the same thing on this page which is intended as a fairly gentle introduction to chromatography.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Carrying out thin layer chromatography<br>  <br>  Background<br>  <br>  Chromatography is used to separate mixtures of substances into their components. All forms of chromatography work on the same principle.<br>  <br>  They all have a stationary phase (a solid, or a liquid supported on a solid) and a mobile phase (a liquid or a gas). The mobile phase flows through the stationary phase and carries the components of the mixture with it. Different components travel at different rates. We'll look at the reasons for this further down the page.<br>  <br>  Thin layer chromatography is done exactly as it says - using a thin, uniform layer of silica gel or alumina coated onto a piece of glass, metal or rigid plastic.<br>  <br>  The silica gel (or the alumina) is the stationary phase. The stationary phase for thin layer chromatography also often contains a substance which fluoresces in UV light - for reasons you will see later. The mobile phase is a suitable liquid solvent or mixture of solvents.<br>  <br>  Producing the chromatogram<br>  <br>  We'll start with a very simple case - just trying to show that a particular dye is in fact a mixture of simpler dyes.<br>  <br>  A pencil line is drawn near the bottom of the plate and a small drop of a solution of the dye mixture is placed on it. Any labelling on the plate to show the original position of the drop must also be in pencil. If any of this was done in ink, dyes from the ink would also move as the chromatogram developed.<br>  <br>  When the spot of mixture is dry, the plate is stood in a shallow layer of solvent in a covered beaker. It is important that the solvent level is below the line with the spot on it.<br>  <br>  The reason for covering the beaker is to make sure that the atmosphere in the beaker is saturated with solvent vapour. To help this, the beaker is often lined with some filter paper soaked in solvent. Saturating the atmosphere in the beaker with vapour stops the solvent from evaporating as it rises up the plate.<br>  <br>  As the solvent slowly travels up the plate, the different components of the dye mixture travel at different rates and the mixture is separated into different coloured spots.<br>  <br>  The diagram shows the plate after the solvent has moved about half way up it.<br>  <br>  The solvent is allowed to rise until it almost reaches the top of the plate. That will give the maximum separation of the dye components for this particular combination of solvent and stationary phase.<br>  <br>  Measuring Rf values<br>  <br>  If all you wanted to know is how many different dyes made up the mixture, you could just stop there. However, measurements are often taken from the plate in order to help identify the compounds present. These measurements are the distance travelled by the solvent, and the distance travelled by individual spots.<br>  <br>  When the solvent front gets close to the top of the plate, the plate is removed from the beaker and the position of the solvent is marked with another line before it has a chance to evaporate.<br>  <br>  Measurements are then taken:<br>  <br>  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS writing, go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chromatography/thinlayer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chro...</a>

When you time travel either back, or forward you cant meet or run into your past or future self because you "are" your past or future self when you time travel. So if you're 25 years old now and go back in time 5 years you will just be yourself at 20 years old. And not have much knowledge of it except for some memories.<br>  <br>  Another thing about time travel is that time travelers cant recall much of their travels once brought back to current time. So you could basically be here from a past or future time and not even know it.|`|f29682f37e62ce0c97dbbcb7b4e7a137aa	Time can't be linear if time travel is possible.  Like your example above if shot, then dead, then no travel back in time.  You'd need to think about time as more of a point on a grid and you are traveling to different points, not 'back and forth'.|`|4uOWeRbtaa	jeezes id like to know that to id like to win the lottery buy playing the winning numbers just an hour ago lol :D pick all the numbers HAHAHAH|`|VPAMzE3uaa	The notion of "time travel" is based on Einstein's observation that "time" is represented by the light that bounces off the face of a clock.  It does so at the speed of light.  So, he theorized, if you traveled away from the clock at the speed of light, you would be traveling with the clock reflection and thus time would stand still.  It is further theorized that if you traveled away from that clock faster than the speed of light, the clock would appear to go backwards.<br>  <br>  The "travel" part of this is that in order to do this, you would have to be heading away from whatever you're looking at at the speed of light.  Even if that did mean "traveling back in time", you'd also be traveling away from earth, this galaxy, universe, etc.<br>  <br>  I don't think Einstein really believed time travel was possible.  There is no theory that I've ever heard that allows time travel without getting very far away from your present existence.<br>  <br>  So, your question is moot.  It is impossible to meet your pasts self, let alone interact in any physical way (like shooting yourself in the face).|`|oVz6sPsIaa	"The laws of time travel" ????  What laws?

So I'm gonna tell why there can be life on earth. Circumstances. Extreme luck. Out of a million planets you might find 5 where life might could exist. <br>  For life to exist you need just the right rotation speed of a planet, the right size (gravity and all that), you need water, <--oxygen obv, you need just the right distance from the right kind of a sun, you need a protecting atmosphere from all the radiation, from meteors and several other things, the planet can't have too much radioactive materials, you something solid to lie over the lava, you can't have too many volcano eruptions and so on. And even after that there are dozens of more life and death critical things. And after that "life" needs the planet to remain stable for about ONE BILLION YEARS to evolve. Beyond all this I have probably forgotten to mention like a hundred things.. That's why it's so difficult to find a planet where life can, will or has existed.

15mbP1hqaa	I suppose you refer to water vapour and ambient conditions (T=25 C and P=1 atm).<br>  <br>  In general, the error is asociated to the extent the gas is deviating from the ideal gas behavior. The compressibility factor (Z) is a useful thermodynamic property for modifying the ideal gas law to account for the real gas behaviour. It is extremely difficult to generalize at what pressures or temperatures the deviation from the ideal gas becomes important. As a rule of thumb, the ideal gas law is reasonably accurate up to a pressure of about 2 atm, and even higher for small non-associating molecules.<br>  <br>  At ambient conditions the compressibility factor of water is rather close to 0.9-1 and thus, behaves closely as ideal gas.

UIpV1g3eaa	Images are formed with pictures. A picture is "drawn" on the screen one line at a time. The line is a piece of signal that has been decoded and is being drawn from left to right, top to bottom. (Of the screen) The picture itself is formed of thousands of pixels. Think of a pixel as a square that has three lights (red, green, and blue) that can light up individually to make any color (all the colors at once makes white light). The signal turns all of these lights into a picture by changing what lights are on or off depending on what color that part of the picture calls for. Every time that a picture is "drawn", the screen has been "refreshed". By refreshing the screen various times per second, the still picture can turn into a moving picture. The faster the refresh rate, the smoother the picture will animate.

p0SOWgb5aa	If you are looking for a well paying, 'guranteed' job, marine biology is not for you I am afraid to say! <br>  <br>  For pay you are looking at ￡15 000 entry level with a BSc. ($30 000) and maybe ￡20 000 entry level with an MSc. ($40 000)<br>  It increases with work experience, some universities pay quite well and it's a fairly stable job but these jobs are hard to come by, marine biology is an extemely competitive field...<br>  See also:<a href="http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Marine_Biologist/Salary" rel="nofollow">http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=...</a><br>  although I think they are being a bit generous with some of their estimates...<br>  <br>  Time spent in college varies, 4 years for a BSc. in the US (3 in the UK), 2 years for an MSc, (1 in the UK), time to do a Phd. varies, I would say 3 minimum. <br>  You are generally recommended to get a least an MSc. so your're looking at 6 years of college for an MSc. if you do it all in one go and don't take a year off to work/volunteer/travel as a lot of people do. You don't need to do a Phd. straight away, even if you would like one, some employers actually let you do it while you work.<br>  <br>  Some people do not do Marine Biology straight away at undergraduate level because they know they want to go on and do a Masters and want a more broad foundation in science, either way is perfectly acceptable. <br>  Reccomended undergraduate degrees would be biology, zoology, botany or something related to environmental sciences or oceanography, or obviously marine biology. I personally think joint degrees are great, say Marine Biology WITH Zoology, it gets you the broader knowledge but you can do what you want straight away.<br>  If you are planning to do a Masters, where and what you do at an undergraduate level does not really matter that much as long as you can get into grad school, postgraduate degrees are what makes the difference.<br>  <br>  Schooling is not the only requirement though, to be competitive you usually need a lot of experience as well; volunteering or interning at relevant places greatly increase your chances; aquariums, marine labs or even natural history museums, any experience is good experience.<br>  Some universities, especially in the US will also allow you to an internship for credit, a friend of mine goes to College of Atlantic and interned at Mote Marine Laboratory and Beam Reach Marine Research while doing it. <br>  Other schools like Eckerd cooperate closely with marine labs (Mote in this case) and allow you to get practical experience there.<br>  <br>  It should probably also be pointed out marine bio is nothing like what television makes it out to be, most people think, marine bio= whales, seals, dolphins, sharks. That is not the case, a tiny minority of marine biologists do work in that field but most work in with algae, plankton, invertebrates and fisheries....<br>  <br>  For more information, check out this site:<br>  <a href="http://marinebio.org/MarineBio/Careers/" rel="nofollow">http://marinebio.org/MarineBio/Careers/</a><br>  Or to ask more questions:<br>  <a href="http://planktonforums.org/" rel="nofollow">http://planktonforums.org/</a><br>  Also check out:<br>  <a href="http://cetaceanchatter.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cetaceanchatter.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://planktonforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4936" rel="nofollow">http://planktonforums.org/viewtopic.php?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkOj7w3a.Um312eaIkYPkUDty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080829081650AAvqrJT&show=7#profile-info-yk71WuvXaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Apar1jaZ6eBkNrCE4NYt.5zty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081030154938AAgcOXz&show=7#profile-info-hFyodb4Daa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  For information with a slight comedic spin...<br>  <a href="http://www.lovelab.id.ucsb.edu/biologist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lovelab.id.ucsb.edu/biologist...</a>|`|0zmMikKHaa	www.bls.gov/OCO/ <br>  <br>  Check out that site.

8oCwrIR2aa	His take home should be: ￡ 883.70.<br>  <br>  You find that by starting with the gross pay and subtracting the credits. That leaves a taxable remainder. If it is less than the ￡700 cut off, then you multiply it by the 20% rate to find the tax withholding and subtract that from the remainder after taking out the credits. That's his take home pay.<br>  <br>  If it's larger than the cut off, then you have two taxable components: the cut off total that you multiply by the 20% rate, and the difference of the remainder after subtracting the credits and the cut off. That amount is multiplied by the higher rate. Both withholdings are subtracted from the gross and that's the take home pay.<br>  <br>  That's what's in store here. His gross, ￡1,200, minus the credits,  ￡70, is ￡1,130. That exceeds the ￡700 cut off so you have two more calculations to do:<br>  <br>  (￡1,130 - ￡700) * 0.41 = ￡430 * 0.41 = ￡176.30<br>  ￡700 * 0.20 = ￡140<br>  <br>  Added, that is: ￡176.30 + ￡140 = ￡316.30<br>  <br>  Then subtract that from the ￡1,200:<br>  <br>  ￡1,200 - ￡316.30 = ￡883.70<br>  <br>  Looking at your answer of ￡925, I think you hit a 3 on the calculator at a point in the calculation when you should've hit a 4. I think it was like this:<br>  <br>  ￡1,200 - ￡70 = ￡1,130<br>  <br>  ￡1,130 - ￡700 = ￡430<br>  <br>  Then, when entering the multiplication of the ￡430 remainder, I think you entered ￡330:<br>  <br>  ￡330 * 0.41 = ￡135.30<br>  <br>  and with the ￡140 from the ￡700, you would subtract ￡275.30 from the ￡1,200. That gives ￡924.70.<br>  <br>  I admit, that only explains it if you were rounding to the nearest ￡, but I think it's the likely problem.

9BbV2xqIaa	The ideal gas law has some postulates:<br>  (1) gases consist of small particles (molecules) which are in continuous random motion.<br>  (2) the volume of the molecules present is negligible compared to the total volume occupied by the gas.<br>  (3) intermolecular forces are negligible.<br>  (4) pressure is due to the gas molecules colliding with the walls of the container.<br>  <br>  under ordinary conditions, deviations from ideal gas behaviour are so slight that they can be neglected. the gases the deviate are called non-ideal gases.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	An ideal gas is a gas which would follow both Boyle's Law and Charles' Law perfectly.

SvmZlLdaaa	Like all reptiles, snakes have a cloaca - a single opening through which they excrete, mate and lay eggs/give birth. Males have two penises, often referred to as hemipenes, which under normal circumstances are inverted inside his cloaca. When he is about to mate, they are everted and one is inserted into the female's cloaca. Sperm is deposited inside her, where it fertilises her eggs. In some species, for example pythons, these are then coated in shell and laid, and will hatch after an incubation period. In others, for example rattlesnakes, the eggs are retained inside the mother's body, without shells, until the young are fully developed, when they are born alive.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Like all reptiles, the female lays eggs.  The male fertilizes the eggs.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	How do snakes reproduce?<br>  <br>  Pretty much the way all other vertebrates do. Snakes are all either male or female, though it may be hard to tell which is which unless you're trained, or unless you see the snakes in the act of mating. The male has two structures called hemipenes, either of which he may use in mating with the female. The female may either lay eggs (oviparous) or retain the eggs in her body until they hatch and the young emerge alive (ovoviviparous). Baby snakes are ready to go as soon as they are hatched or born. There is no parental care in terms of feeding, though the females of a few species may remain for a few days after hatching.|`|33ppbrMJaa	They lay eggs which, like a chicken egg, is fertilized by the male snake. There may be reptiles that actually give birth by carrying their young in their wombs...if they have wombs. I don't know about that.

vTvsgVJiaa	Hmm... sounds to me like your poor kitty has been invaded by space aliens.  My best suggestion is to get your hands on a good ray gun, and some sort of protective ooze-suit for yourself.  Throw your kitty out the window to the yard so the aliens don't have to destroy your house when they come to take her back.  Then when they are on the yard, jump out from the closet (with your ooze-suit on) and shoot em with the ray gun.  Then steal their spaceship, fly it back to their planet and destroy it.  You are our only hope so please save us from the kitty aliens!!!|`|5nYC6RM1aa	Lmao! You really made my day.

X0e6p9Ilaa	The names of the products will depend in part on the acid/base theory being used.<br>  <br>  Arrhenius theory:<br>  acid + base --> salt + water<br>  <br>  Bronsted-Lowry theory<br>  acid + base --> conjugate acid + conjugate base<br>  <br>  The most common explanation of acid/base reactions in beginning chemistry classes is the Arrhenius theory.

kWJkhm3gaa	Well...that's a broad question...the digestive system and circulatory system are related due to the fact that the circulatory system absorbs nutrients from the digestive system. This is done pretty much by the lacteals and villi. Generally speaking the villi absorb the nutrients into the blood and the lacteals pretty much absorb fat into the lymph system, which is a part of the circulatory system, which can then be carried up the lymph system and released into the blood system. The hepatic portal vein carries the blood from the digestive organs to the liver where it is more or less filtered and the glycogen is made. They have the common feature of supplying organic molecules and other essential substances to the body.  The digestive system takes it into the body and the circulatory system takes it to individual cells.  Um, I guess that's a basic idea. Hope it helps you some. :)|`|3CSoSRmtaa	I haven't studied this, but from my observation the blood warms the stomach making the digestive system run at a smooth pace.  Like warm air moves quicker than cold.  Digesting in a cold setting would slow the movement of food.  In other words circulation helps the digestive process through warmth.|`|kO91ckv7aa	The energy from the food goes into the blood (abbsorption) from the small intestines, part of the digestive system. I guess that is the relationship-....absorption.

4c54zUjuaa	Many African nations that have elephants are actively working to conserve and support the species. In many parks, these effeorts have been so successful that the elephant herds are getting too large and causing damage to the habitat. These herds must be "culled," meaning excess elephants are killed by game wardens. When this is done, the meat is typically donated to local communities. The same happens when trophy hunters kill elephants legally on game reserves. Some countries where this happens include Namibia and Botswana. South Africa may have to begin culling herds soon.<br>  <br>  There have also been reports that the Zimbabwe army cancelled it's contracts to provide beef to it's soldiers because it was easier and cheaper to provide elephant meat.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	It's not particularly tasty I would imagine, and for the most part, it's illegal to kill elephants.

z7BiMSWmaa	Mitochondrial Eve is a concept.<br>  <br>  Mitochondrial Eve represents one of the most poorly understood scientific ideas of the 20th century. In its time it has been feted and condemned, frequently by the same parties at different times. The premise of the idea is that we can all be traced back to a single woman living in Africa approximately 200,000 years ago.|`|pKfX2ZXnaa	Mitochondrial Eve<br>   <br>  <br>  A comparison of the mitochondrial DNA of humans from many races and regions suggests that all of these DNA sequences have evolved molecularly from a common ancestor sequence. <br>  <br>  Under the assumption that an individual inherits mitochondria only from his or her mother, this finding implies that all living humans descend from one woman - possibly one pre-human woman - who researchers have dubbed Mitochondrial Eve. <br>  <br>  Based on the molecular clock technique, Eve is believed to have lived about 150,000 years ago. Family trees suggest she lived in Africa. <br>  <br>  Although researchers named her after the Biblical Eve, mitochondrial Eve was not the sole living female of her day. Researchers believe as many as 20,000 individuals of Eve's species may have lived at the same time as her. But of the females of her day, only Eve produced an unbroken line of daughters that persists today. As a result, only Eve's mitochondria have descendants in the cells of living humans, and only from Eve do all living people descend along their maternal lines. <br>   <br>  <br>  Chain of events<br>  This surprising circumstance is assumed to be an effect of chance rather than selection. Essentially, the hypothesized process by which all lineages but one disappear is the same as the genetic drift of alleles. As with genetic drift, the process is much slower and much less likely to reach completion in a large population than in a small one. If Eve had lived among a million or a billion other females, it is very unlikely that the matralineal ancestries of all humans alive today would converge on Eve (or any one contemporary of Eve's). <br>  <br>  Why might the community of Eve's peers have been so small? One possibility is that the world population of humans in Eve's day passed through a bottleneck. Another is that Eve lived in a subpopulation of humans that came to supplant all others. A still more extreme version of this latter scenario is that Eve lived shortly after whatever isolating event caused the speciation of anatomically modern humans. Of the ancient "hominoid" remains discovered so far, in fact, the oldest that match the bones of living humans date from around the time that Eve lived.

Latent heat is the energy added to or lost by a body to cause a phase change. In a boiler the phase change is the water going from liquid to gas. So you could say there is a "transfer" of latent heat occurring inside the boiler where the phase change happens.<br>  <br>  So what the previous answer actually describes is the location of thermal energy. Heat is specifically defined as a transfer of energy due to a temperature difference.

There is quite a lot of difference between cell types, but most cells have certain features.<br>  Animal cells seem simpler to study than plant cells, because they are not made up of so many parts. Most animal cells have three main components. <br>  <br>  You should be able to label the 3 main components of this typical animal cell, on the labelling lines.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Points marked with an asterisk below are important connections with the next topic. Cytoplasm is a fairly transparent jelly-like substance consisting mainly of water* and protein as well as many other dissolved substances (solutes)*. It may contain granules, globules etc, e.g. glycogen, fat. It seems shapeless and it may appear to flow about. Under high magnification we may see small structures or organelles with their own functions, e.g. nucleus, mitochondria. Most of the biochemical processes of the cell, e.g. respiration, take place here. <br>  <br>  N.b. Animal cells are unlikely to contain many or large vacuoles, as shown in some textbooks. <br>  <br>  The nucleus [plural- nuclei] is round in shape, with a nuclear membrane on the outside. It controls the development and activities of the cell, especially cell division. It contains structures called chromosomes made of protein and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) which carry genetic information from cell to cell, and from generation to generation. <br>  <br>  N.b. There is always a film of moisture* on the outside of an actively growing living cell. The cell membrane (plasma membrane) is a very thin, flexible and rather elastic layer around the outside of the cell. It is made of fats and proteins. It is said to be selectively permeable* as it holds in the cell contents, as well as allowing useful substances to pass into and waste substances out of the cell. <br>  Movement of substances into cells is partly by diffusion* and partly by active selective processes (active transport). <br>  <br>  Name some (specific) substances useful to the typical (animal) cell, which may enter via the cell membrane. <br>  > oxygen<br>  > glucose <br>  <br>  Name a waste substance from a typical (animal) cell. <br>  > carbon dioxide <br>  <br>  Give the name and function of the 2 special animal cells below. Label and explain the parts of each cell concerned with that special function.<br>  <br>   <br>  cell name: [motor] neurone (nerve cell)<br>  cell function : to transmit nervous impulses [to muscle/gland]<br>  [fatty sheath - insulates & speeds up messages] <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  cell name:sperm cell<br>  cell function : to fertilise egg cell <br>  <br>  Both animal cells and plant cells share the same 3 features. However, plant cells usually have the following features in addition:<br>  <br>  A cell wall - normally composed of cellulose- on the outside of the cell. This is rigid, so it gives the plant cell its shape. It is made of several layers of parallel fibres, and the gaps are filled in with jelly-like substances, e.g. pectin. This means it is usually freely permeable to many molecules, especially gases and water. In some parts of a plant it may be impregnated with other substances e.g. lignin for strength in wood, or suberin for waterproofing in bark.<br>  <br>  The cell wall gives most plant cells a fairly regular many-sided outline. The cellulose is secreted by the cytoplasm when a cell divides and it gradually thickens up as more materials are added. It stays soft and extensible until the cell stops growing, then it becomes tougher. It is non-living and not part of the cytoplasm. Normally, the cell membrane is pushed tightly against the inside of it, so that it is practically invisible, but it may be seen when the cytoplasm shrinks.<br>  <br>  A vacuole is a cavity, usually in the centre of the cell, containing a liquid, known as cell sap. This may be a store of water and dissolved substances, e.g. sugars and metabolic by-products. The vacuolar membrane is similar to the cell membrane. Sometimes it is said that animal cells have a vacuole, but these are usually much smaller and only temporary.<br>  <br>  Because it has a vacuole, the cytoplasm in a plant cell is usually pushed to the outside of the cell, so that it forms a thin layer inside the cell wall. The nucleus is also displaced to the edge. <br>  <br>  Chloroplasts may be present in the cytoplasm, in different numbers, e.g. cells of leaves contain more than stems, and roots usually contain none at all. Chloroplasts are green, due to the pigment chlorophyll, and are said to be the site of photosynthesis, which only goes on in green plants. Label the diagrams below, and colour in as appropriate.<br>  Name and note the functions of the cells, and explain their specialisations.<br>  Cell name : palisade mesophyll cell<br>  Function : to carry out photosynthesis<br>  Specialisations : many chloroplasts containing chlorophyll - regular columnar shape enabling close packing for efficient absorption of light and water<br>  <br>  Cell name : root hair cell<br>  <br>  Function : to absorb water and mineFunction : to absorb water and mineral ions from soil<br>  <br>  Specialisations : projecting section has large surface area for absorption of water and minerals from soil water - no chloroplasts<br>  <br>  <br>  CELL SPECIALISATION<br>  <br>  In both plants and animals, individual cells cannot get much bigger than a certain size. Therefore, in order to grow, an organism must increase the number of cells it is made up from. This is done by cell division, i.e. by individual single cells dividing repeatedly so that each one gives rise to two cells.<br>  <br>  At the same time, cells may become specialised according to the tasks they have to perform. These specialisations usually involve some modifications of the structure described above, and the process of changing is called differentiation. <br>  Many similar cells may be grouped together to form tissues. These may then be combined to make organs which have major functions , and several of these work together to form organ systems.<br>  So an individual living organism (plant or animal) is said to be made up from all these sub-units. <br>  Name at least 3 types of cells from the human body, and briefly mention any special characteristics that enable them to perform their functions.

Some of the transplanted nuclei were from frogs of different colour varieties. After this, the eggs were usually able to develop normally, and tadpoles hatched out and grew into adult frogs.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Keep in mind that ammonium hydroxide only exists in an aqueous solution and it only exits in equilibrium with dissolved ammonia gas and water.  And the equilibrium lies far to the left, meaning that there is little ammonium ion or hydroxide ion, just enough to make the solution basic.<br>  <br>  NH3(aq) + HOH(l)  <==> NH4+ + OH-<br>  <br>  Since the "ammonium hydroxide" solution is slightly basic with any salt that will produce an insoluble hydroxide.<br>  <br>  One of the more interesting reactions is to slowly add a solution of ammonium hydroxide (which is actually a solution of ammonia) to a solution of copper (II) nitrate which is blue.  At first, a blue gelatinous precipitate forms as which darkens as NH3(aq) is added.  Then the precipitate gradually dissolves as the solution becomes a dark purple.  With enough NH3(aq) the precipitate will be gone and the solution will again allow light to pass through, although it will be a very dark purple.<br>  <br>  This occurs because the ammonia molecules replace water molecules as the ligands which surround copper (II) ions.<br>  <br>  Cu(OH)2(s) + 4NH3(aq) (excess) --> [Cu(NH3)4]^2+ + 2OH-

That means that the angular acceleration N/I decreases with height in proportion to h.  So, the middle is only falls at half the rate that it would if the upper half where absent. This causes the middle to effectively retain half its weight during the fall which must be supported by the rest of the structure. This stress breaks the chimney.

4fWZL4TRaa	About these NEMA specifications (from the link below):<br>  The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standardized four basic design categories of Induction motors to match the torque-speed requirements of the most common types of mechanical loads. These basic design categories are Design A, Design B, Design C and Design D.<br>  <br>  The Design B motor serves as the basis for comparison of motor performance with other designs. It has the broadest field of application and is used to drive centrifugal pumps, fans, blowers and machine tools. It has a relatively high efficiency, even at light loads, and a relatively high power factor at full load.<br>  <br>  The Design A motor has essentially the same characteristics as the Design B, except for somewhat higher break-down torque. Since its starting current is higher, however, its field of application is limited.<br>  <br>  The Design C motor has a higher locked-rotor torque, but a lower break-down torque than the Design B. The higher starting torque makes it suitable for driving plunger pumps, vibrating screens and compressors without unloading devices. The starting current and slip at rated torque are essentially the same as that for the Design B.<br>  <br>  The Design D motor has a very high locked-rotor torque and a high slip. Its principal field of application is in high-inertia loads such as fly-wheel equipped punch presses, elevators and hoists.<br>  <br>  The Design D rotor has relatively high-resistance, low-reactance rotor bars close to the surface. Design B and Design A have low-resistance with high reactance at the deeper bars.

E0U2yII3aa	By definition, a planet should be orbiting a star and has mass lower than that of brown dwarfs' theoretical minimum mass of 13 Jupiters. A planet can be kicked out from a planetary system by many reasons like death of a parent star specially when the planet is far from the star itself, gravitational interactions with more massive objects (Jupiter-like planets and brown dwarfs) in the planetary system and gravitational disturbance by another star specially in globular clusters (remember Methuselah in M4 though it remained with its parent star). The planet will wander through interstellar space without a star never to return again.|`|UkjnSyAvaa	You can see the same stars from any planet in the solar system that we can see from earth.

E0U2yII3aa	The sun's surface temperature is around 5780K. This temperature gives it a yellowish color. By the way it is on main sequence. <br>  <br>  Red dwarfs are also main sequence stars that have temperatures only as high as 3700K. They have masses to only as high as 40% that of the sun. Their usual radii are around 10% that of the sun or around Jupiter's. They are pretty common but they have luminosities less than 5% that of the sun. That is why not one of them is visible to the naked eye. The nearest star, Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf but is 500x less luminous and about 20,000x less bright.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf</a><br>  <a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~jkaler/sow/rigil-kent.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~jkaler/sow/ri...</a><br>  <br>  Red giants and red supergiants on the other hand are stars near the end of their lives. Red giants are for less massive stars while red supergiants  are for the massive stars. Like the red dwarfs, the reddish hue/color is a product of lower surface tempearture usually around 3500K and below. Red giants have diameters between 30 suns to as large as 200 suns. Famous examples for this type of star are Gacrux and Mira. Red supergiants are even larger sine their progenitors are massive as well. Some supergiants even exceed the 1000x radius mark like that of Betelgeuse.

Many are red dwarfs which are smaller and much less bright than the sun. There are no red dwarfs that we can see with the naked eye except for Epsilon Eridani, and it's relatively large for a red dwarf and not as red as most. The ones we can see clearly are red giants. They are stars which used to be "normal" main sequence stars but have expanded and cooled in the later stages of their lifetimes. The sun will become a red giant one day. It won't be as hot as it is now, but because it will extend out probably to the orbit of earth, that will mean the end of life here.|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	o_0; You mean red giants?

If you only want to light up one LED at a time, you can use a 4 bit to 16 bit decoder, or two LS138s. <br>  <br>  If you need to light up any combination of the 16, you need to use 16 latches, like LS74s or LS273s, one latch per LED, and then use combinations of the 8 input bits to latch them. For example, 4 of the data bits can be decoded to 16 combinations, with the other 4 as the actual data. Thus you can latch up to 16 x 4 bits. <br>  <br>  .
dEpcj06raa	Neptune's blue color is largely the result of absorption of red light by methane in the atmosphere but there is some additional as-yet-unidentified chromophore which gives the clouds their rich blue tint. <br>  <br>  Neptune's composition is probably similar to Uranus': various "ices" and rock with about 15% hydrogen and a little helium. Like Uranus, but unlike Jupiter and Saturn, it may not have a distinct internal layering but rather to be more or less uniform in composition. But there is most likely a small core (about the mass of the Earth) of rocky material. Its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium with a small amount of methane. <br>  <br>  After the discovery of Uranus, it was noticed that its orbit was not as it should be in accordance with Newton's laws. It was therefore predicted that another more distant planet must be perturbing Uranus' orbit. Neptune was first observed by Galle and d'Arrest on 1846 Sept 23 very near to the locations independently predicted by Adams and Le Verrier from calculations based on the observed positions of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. An international dispute arose between the English and French (though not, apparently between Adams and Le Verrier personally) over priority and the right to name the new planet; they are now jointly credited with Neptune's discovery. Subsequent observations have shown that the orbits calculated by Adams and Le Verrier diverge from Neptune's actual orbit fairly quickly. Had the search for the planet taken place a few years earlier or later it would not have been found anywhere near the predicted location.|`|Sj7aMQXIaa	Planet Neptune Is blue because of the Frozen Methane gas that is the biggest constituent of its outer layer.

A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane occur at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder aquamarine. Since Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Neptune has a methane-rich atmosphere, and the methane absorbs the red light in the colour spectrum, making the planet look very blue.|`|ROPLbLW9aa	Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance, or because its sad and lonely. i dont know which|`|QMhl2DGQaa	coz of the water and ice

A wet cell, on the other hand, is a cell with a liquid electrolyte, such as the lead-acid batteries in most cars.<br>  <br>  While a dry cell's electrolyte is not truly completely free of moisture and must contain some moisture to function, when it was first developed it had the advantage of containing no sloshing liquid that might leak or drip out when inverted or handled roughly, making it highly suitable for small portable electric devices. By comparison, the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top, and needed careful handling to avoid spillage. An inverted wet cell would almost certainly leak, while a dry cell would not. Lead-acid batteries would not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell, until the development of the gel battery.<br>  <br>  A common dry cell battery is the zinc-carbon battery, using a cell sometimes called the dry Leclanché cell, with a nominal voltage of 1.5 volts, the same nominal voltage as the alkaline battery (since both use the same zinc-manganese dioxide combination). Multiple cells are commonly connected in series within a single case or battery compartment within a device to form a dry battery (or dry cell battery) of greater voltage than is provided by one cell. A well known dry battery is the 9-volt "transistor radio battery" (PP3 battery) which is internally constructed of a standard stack of six carbon-zinc or alkaline cells, seven nickel-metal hydride cells, or three lithium cells.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Increasing the resistance will NOT increase the voltage.<br>  <br>  In fact, the voltage applied to your electrolytic cell is constant, and is a function of the power supply or battery.  It maintains the same difference in potential energy.  <br>  <br>  When you increase the resistance of the electrolytic cell by increasing the distance between between the electrodes, you decrease the current.  Current is the "rate of flow of charge".  This means that there will be fewer electrons available to interact with the copper.<br>  <br>  This is all explained by Ohm's law:<br>  I = V / R<br>  where I = current (amps), V = potential difference (volts), R = resistance (ohms)<br>  <br>  For a constant V, as R increases, I decreases<br>  As I decreases, your rate of reaction decreases.
Gnfc4wRlaa	In an oceanic-continental boundary, the two plates (the oceanic plate and the continental plate) ram into each other, causing the oceanic plate to subduct beneath the continental plate because of the difference in density. The magma under the Earth’s surface is less dense than the oceanic plate running into it, so it rises and forms a chain of volcanoes on the surface of the continental plate.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	The ocean slab is denser than the continent slab.  If the two plates are moving toward each other, the ocean plate will be over-ridden, will slide under the continent.  melting of this slab is generally the source of the volcanism, and since magma tends to rise upward, it will migrate up into the continent.<br>  <br>  A second effect is that the outer edge of the continental mass tends to crumple and rise when it encounters anoth plate, and this is also a mechanism that leads to volcanism.<br>  <br>  And finally, the more silica rich rock of the continental masses tends to melt at a much lower temperature than the silica poor material of the oceanic crust and upper mantle, so it is easier to melt the continental material than the oceanic material (it is the sediments that are mixed with water that tend to melt from the ocean slab when it descends, eh).

Is earth unique or one of millions of others like it in this galaxy alone. <br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems is that a planet that can sustain life isn't the size of Saturn which is so small that you can only see it when it is between us and its sun.. compared to something on earth that is like detecting a mosquito in front of a very strong headlight of a truck.. detecting an "earth" is like detecting a very small flea in that same headlight. <br>  <br>  Everything considered I think it's a waste of time and money.

Well for one so we can answer how common those types of planets are in the universe. Secondly, we want to find out if life is common in the universe or if earth is unique. If we can find planets similar to earth, we can determine if there is life (as we know it) on those planets. This is a profound and fundamental question that could shed light on the origins of life on earth. Finally, we know that our sun will one day die which would mean the end of our solar system and life on earth. It would be nice to find another planet that humans could colonize (unless others already live there) to continue our species.

Kinetochore microtubules now start moving chromosomes toward the middle of the cell <br>  <br>  [3] Metaphase - Chromosomes line up along an imaginary plane called the metaphase plate <br>  <br>  [4] Anaphase - Centromeres split and sister chromatids are pulled toward opposite poles of the cell.

Nuclear membrane re-formation begins [variably included: cytokinesis follows at this time]<br>  ----------<br>  MEIOSIS<br>  <br>  In meiosis, the nucleus of a cell divides twice [meiosis 1 and meiosis 2]. A single cell produces four cells by the end of meiosis. In sexually reproducing diploid animals (having two sets of chromosomes per cell), meiosis occurs during formation of the gametes (sex cells – see sperm and ovum), so that the gametes are haploid (having only one set of chromosomes – half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell). <br>  <br>  Meiosis I and II are each similar to mitosis, especially meiosis II. They all use the same language to describe similar processes, such as prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. Genetic material forms clumps called chromatids.They both use spindles, kinetochores and microtubules. Nuclear membranes break down, genetic material lines up at the metaphase plate, divides and is segregated. Then new nuclear membranes form around the daughter chromosomes and this is followed by cytokinesis and cleavage of the cytoplasm.<br>  <br>  But there are two dramatic differences: <a href="http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/bi/1991/meiosis_dance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/bi/1991/...</a> <br>  <br>  [1] There are two divisions instead of one. <br>  [2] The chromosomes line up separately on the spindle for metaphase of mitosis, but at the first division of meiosis the chromosomes pair in a process called synapsis. In synapsis, homologous chromosomes pair tightly along their length and then move to opposite poles so that only one of each pair of chromosomes ends up in each cell after the first division.”<br>  <br>  INTERPHASE: replication of DNA (4N)<br>  PROPHASE I<br>  Leptotene: condensation of chromatin<br>  Zygotene: pairing of homologues<br>  Pachytene: crossing-over and recombination<br>  Diplotene: synaptonemal complexes dissociate<br>  Diakinesis: chiasmata disappear and homologues begin to repel<br>  METAPHASE I: one face of each homologue centromere binds to a spindle fiber<br>  ANAPHASE I: homologous pairs separate and begin to move<br>  TELOPHASE I: chromosomes migrate to each pole, cell division (2N)<br>  PROPHASE II: spindle fibers rearrange and chromosomes recondense<br>  METAPHASE II: chromosomal pairs align along spindle equator<br>  ANAPHASE II: sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles<br>  TELOPHASE II: each daughter cell nucleus has one set of chromosomes (1N)|`|NIb8zWEHaa	<a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/ge/genie/vgec/he/cellcycle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.le.ac.uk/ge/genie/vgec/he/cel...</a><br>  see this and you will get all what you want|`|9dcd19c7dec39b3d7b8127a4328d3eccaa	I hate to tell you that there is no simple explanation when learning mitosis and meiosis.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	1) No, according to the wierd math of special relativity, when you add velocities, 1+1 does not equal 2.  1+1 = 1.  More generally, when you add velocities, v1 and v2 (measured in units of c), you get:<br>  vtotal = (v1+v2)/(1+v1v2)<br>  <br>  2) Now this question opens up a bit of a can of worms.  While nothing can travel through space at speeds faster than c, it may be possible for space/time itself to expand faster than c.  In fact, it appears that the universe did this early on--expanding much much faster than c.  We call this phenomenon inflation, but we have no idea what mechanism drove it.  It's one of the big open questions in physics.  This is why the universe is less than 14 billion years old, but its size in light years is much bigger.|`|t1hlab8Kaa	I think that the limit on the speed of light was set at the speed of light  times itself or squared (C x C) in Einstein's equation: <br>  --------         2<br>  E=MC<br>  ---------<br>  In other words, light may be able to go C x C but not anymore than this.I assume that this has to be a possibility in order for the equation to work especially at the very small atomic and subatomic level.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Google or wiki 'Big bang inflation'.<br>  At one time, the expansion is thought to have exceeded C, <br>  but the parameters of space time had not yet been set.<br>  In our current space/time nothing exceeds C.<br>  Yes it would be possible to emit particles in both directions <br>  whose combined velocities relative to one another would <br>  do so, (even a simple light bulb does this with photons), <br>  but those particles cannot effect each-other in any way, <br>  and, in a sense no longer exist for each-other.<br>  It's one of the paradoxes of relativity.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	1) open question, but generally it is NOT possible.  Quantum physics has identified events that occur that appear to defy this restriction.<br>  <br>  2) even if the light or objects are propogating at light speed, only their relative movement exceeds the speed of light, not their actual movement.  In fact, the one object will never be aware of the other as long as both continue moving at light speed.<br>  <br>  3) apparently the physical universe is constrained by the limit of light speed, so the big bang could not have propogated faster than the speed of light.  However, presumably one side (if there can even be a side) may have been moving relative to the other at faster than c, as per question 1.|`|m4nKkFDUaa	Absolutely not. Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. Ever. You're referring to a photon's speed relative to that of another photon, which is not the photon's actual movement, therefore it's not really going 2c.|`|7QtKAp7jaa	According to Einstein's theory of relativity nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.|`|KByIWbysaa	At present technology it is impossible. DO yu know that you can see things because they they emit waves/particles in phase with the speed of light? And if you can travel faster than the speed of light and if you are traveling towards a distant planet, your travel will somehow give realization to time machines. It is because the light emitted by the stars travel light years therefore you may still see a star up in the sky but that start at present might have been but a black hole. The distance is so long that light needs a very long time to travel.

IPS3hWweaa	Kind of.  A lot of living things are in danger, from forests to insects to birds and small animals as well as humans. We are making this planet harder for us to live on by continuing our destructive ways.<br>  <br>  The Earth isn't in danger, it'll still be around. But humans are going to be forced to adapt to a world which will become far different than what it is today. Can you imagine the Earth with no ice on it's surface? With higher sea levels and different weather patterns?<br>  <br>  Things are gonna get wacky and it's gonna happen in our lifetimes.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	so far its not that bad.<br>  <br>  but when the ice capeds (spelling might be wrong) start to melt in the north pole or south pole, things could ugly.|`|hlpdeiFuaa	Quote: "I don't believe in global warming, the earth can adapt to anything and its definately getting colder not warmer!"<br>  <br>  Here's one troll within' 10000000 ones that spitted something that she doesn't even know the meaning. You better get back in your books and search for the real meaning of Global Warming. Ignorant.<br>  <br>  Our planet gives us space for living and existing...I think it's already a big gift from God. Then Humans came...and the result is obvious: destroying it. Destroying its forests, polluting its water, melting its glaciers, polluting its atmosphere. Some of the things, the Earth is doing it...but it's like a computer...it does what YOU tell to do...and HOW you want it to behave. And WE behave very bad...so Earth does. Quite logical.<br>  <br>  The Earth has its own natural cycle....so with Humans or not, it would have happened a day or another. The fact is that, us Humans are INTENSIVELY accelerating the process and not only that, but bothering it. Unfortunately, we took our Planet for granted. That nothing bad could happen...we live and die...but the Planet continues. NO! If we do not take care of it, she'll die and make us die too. Also logical.<br>  <br>  But now, we shouldn't really talk about Global Warming anymore...it's here and passing...letting space to a Global Climate Change. We'll be hearing it soon on TV. I'm expecting it sooner or later. Before finishing, i'll just give you an example: i'm living in Kuwait, i'm doing some statistics and graphs on temperatures recorded day by day, monthly yearly on a 20 years basis (1989 until 2009). I have already astonishing results but i need to study them further and get an explanation to it. With an eye blink, average monthly temperatures in general passed from 3-4 degrees above and lower ones (depending on the month) from 1989 - 1998 numbers. January / february = -3 to -4 degrees less in average compared to 1989; May / June = +3 to +4 degrees plus in average compared to 1989. That's huge...and I haven't finished...I'm very worried about the results i'll get with other graphs i'll do.<br>  <br>  But one thing i'm quite sure of is this: 4 seasons are disappearing...there will only be 2 seasons (summer and winter), passing from one to another very quickly. Winter is pushing itself further with years passing...and summer is pushing itself further also, until the day it won't have any space anymore when it will confront winter period. One more proof: in Kuwait January and beginning of february was the coldest...now january + february + beginning of march are the colder. June + July + August were the hottest, now July + August + September...<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	Global warming is a political agenda to transfer wealth from producing countries to non-producers.  It's a trendy ploy that takes advantage of the environmental movements with the goal of making money for some individuals, and power for some groups. - since no one is against "saving the earth".  But the earth is not in danger from CO2 since it's what plants need to live, and what humans exhale.<br>  <br>  The GW movement exploded in the media before the common sense opposition had a chance to react.  That's changed now - more and more non-government scientists - ones that don't depend on gov't grants for their livelyhood - are coming out now to contradict Al Gore's scam with accurate data.  Don't worry, the earth will be fine.|`|mV1YscV7aa	There is no doubt that temperatures at the north pole and at altitude in East Africa, have been rising. This is well documented.<br>  <br>  However, it is clear to me that it has NOTHING to do with increasing levels of Carbon dioxide. When I was at school in the 1970s, I was informed that there was 0.03% atmospheric carbon dioxide which was ESSENTIALLY needed by green plants to photosynthesise.<br>  <br>  The rise in global temperatures are part of a natural cycle which has nothing to do with human influence on the environment.  <br>  <br>  Today, it is difficult to find data about CO2 atmospheric levels but, where these are found, they indicate an almost identical level of CO2 as 35 years ago. And it doesn't matter whether a particular molecule of CO2 has been generated by a coal fired power station or from the 4% CO2 that we humans exhale from our lungs, green plants can use these molecules just as well to grow and produce food.<br>  <br>  CERTAIN research scientists have a hidden agenda.

bIlPMK2laa	This unusual pairing will definitely be leading to alteration in the width of the DNA. The constant width of DNA is maintained because a purine always pairs up with a pyrimidine i.e. a monocyclic base is always paired with a bicyclic base pair. If you put 2 monocyclic or two bicyclic base pairs then the width of the DNA will be altered, at some places it will get too thick and at some places too thin.
lMN59lv2aa	Greetings, Jabberwocky. 'Tis a brillig question, to be sure. I shall gyre and gimble in attempt to provide an answer that will satisfy the borogoves and mome raths!<br>  <br>  You have it backwards! Synthesis is always in the 5' – 3' direction. The reason it's always in this direction is because all known DNA and RNA polymerases require a free hydroxyl group. These are always found on the 3' end of DNA or RNA; the 5' end has a phosphate group.
TMB4d3FAaa	Not when they are preying on them.  I have a picture I received in my email that shows an Eagle with a wolf or large Coyote lifted off the carcass of a deer. I haven't looked at it for a while but, the front feet may still be on the ground. There is a crow watching ,not to terribly upset about the attack. Even lions pick their victims and attack strategies. Why should an Eagle be any different? I've watched TV series where the prey chased the lions.  Water Buffalo.  Tolling dogs, usually red for some reason, are used to call in geese.  Who knows why the dog is harassing the Eagles?  One attack from an Eagle that the dog doesn't see coming will either kill the dog or make it wary of Eagles from then on. Nature isn't static and she's always coming up with great surprises.|`|EQdDkSw0aa	I think it depends on the what type of Eagle your talking about.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	I am neither an ornithologist nor a dog expert, so this is just my opinion.  I have noticed that all species of eagles attack land animals that normally do not make loud sounds (and usually small ones).  A dog, even a small daschund, barks loudly when chasing something.  I believe it is the noise of the barking that caused the eagles to disperse, plus the sight of a charging animal at them.|`|FLgDn3OTaa	All predators, and eagles are no exception, tend not to pursue aggressive prey. Some dogs, therefore, are too much hassle to attack for an eagle to bother with, I wouldn't say they're scared as such: they will put up a good fight, but in the end, if the dog is persistent in its defense (which they often are) the eagle will leave it. They, after all, have the power to fly away. The dog doesn't and it knows this, so any air-based attack will be seen as a threat.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Flying dogs have more of an advantage over non-flying dogs when it comes to going up against eagles.|`|SFai2Eb9aa	haha omg yes:D|`|HJnpx7KGaa	no

The highest temperature recorded was 32.9 °C (91.22 °F) at Greycrook, Scottish Borders in August 2003. <br>  <br>  In general, the west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. So, it is likely to be warmer in the south west of Scotland during the summer time (June, July and August).

C8u2jBu7aa	well, let us assume it is indeed possible. for time travel, i assume you mean a object or person moved to another point, in either past or future. if you were to follow the theory of Conservation of Matter, matter is neither created or destroyed, correct?  Therefor, when any object is moved, the atomic makeup of that object would have to exist multiple times at one point in existence. It would also mean that the atomic makeup would be missing from it's original time period. Something like that is obviously completely undocumented, and it is in my belief that it would cause some sort of collapse of existence. Idk. Just a random thought.|`|57CW5UPYaa	Time travel is a very tricky subject and there are a lot of theories.  Here are the ones I tend to subscribe to though.  Assuming time travel is possible...<br>  1) It would not be possible to travel to a point where the time machine itself did not yet exist.  Consider that the earth will not be in the same place today as it is tomorrow because it revolves around the sun, which moves about the galaxy, which itself moves through the expanding universe.  There must be some point of reference about which to travel through time, or else you'd end up traveling through space as well, which would probably land you in the void between galaxies with no proof that the time travel worked.<br>  2) Nothing could change history.  Any attempt to change history would either fail or become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Time has no memory; if a time traveler altered something nobody would know that it had happened two ways, so the simplest explanation is that any temporal tampering must already have been done.|`|1GXG9PIRaa	let me give you an alternate view point on weather time travel is a possibility<br>  <br>  I personally believe that it is not possible <br>  <br>  Hypothetically speaking, if time travel were possible, all of us would always exist. let me explain. In common thought, yesterday "I was".<br>  Today "I am". Tomorrow "I will be". Or, yesterday "I existed", today (now) "I exist", And tomorrow "I Will exist". <br>  <br>  If the "time line" is all encompassing, if every thing that ever happened or ever will happen, exists continuously within the "time-line" and could be visited by someone with a time machine, then we could be visited by people who would live 100 -200 -1,000 or even 1,000,000 years into the future. And, therefore, we would "exist" in a continuous, never ending section of the "time-line". <br>  <br>  What this would mean, is that instead of --- yesterday "I existed" today "I exist," and tomorrow "I will exist", <br>  It would mean that --- yesterday "I exist" today "I exist" and tomorrow "I exist" --------all simultaneously.<br>  <br>  Does this sound possible? Can every one and every thing that ever was or ever will be, continually exist all at the same time????? <br>  <br>  I personally believe that this is to fantastic of a notion to be a possible.<br>  <br>  I believe that "time" as we know it, is simply, a perception of the living and intelligent mind that we and other creatures posses. Each perhaps having a different perception, yet still just a perception.<br>  <br>  I would also like to say that the first two answers both make good points as well.

They are well accepted all over North America. The founders of the breed have followed a planned program to develop a breed of cattle that suits today's needs for fast growth and lean carcasses. The goal has always been to produce cattle that solve many of the management problems in beef herds and are hardy and economical to maintain; show high fertility and outstanding carcass merit. Cows must calve regularly and raise calves that show a high proportion of the cow's weight. <br>  <br>  The BueLingo breed is well adapted to the vast range areas of the West as well as lush farms of the central plains. This is the perfect breed for the operator who must have a profitable farm or ranch operation yet may not necessarily own a large acreage. <br>  <br>  BueLingo cows are extremely fertile and reach puberty at an early age.  They are known for their docile dispositions, and for their ample supply of rich milk. Birth weights of the calves mostly run under 75 lbs. with 205 day weaning weights running as high as 650 to 700 lbs. The cows show excellent femininity. Poor udders are almost unheard of as is vaginal prolapse and many of the other common beef cattle problems. <br>  <br>  BueLingo is a breed now open to producers where BueLingo semen or bulls can be used on other breeds. Offspring with a correct belt are eligible for registry. Likewise, BueLingo females can be raised from bulls of other breeds.<br>  www.buelingo.net <br>  <br>  The first Miniature Panda cow, named “Precious”, was born April 27, 2000. The result of years of development and a happy accident. The Happy Mountain Farm in Washington state had earlier developed a miniature bull only 36 inches tall. A crossbred Irish Dexter and Belted Galloway, his full white belt seemed like a perfect invitation to experiment. The farm bred the bull with one of its miniature cows and ended up with a very small heifer sporting a very wide, white belt. With a panda-like face, all white with large black circles around both eyes, the world’s first Miniature Panda Cow was born.<br>  www.ebertfarms.com/fun/breeds.html|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Some cows make milk, some cows don't.<br>  Some cows are reared for meat, some cows are not<br>  I think all cows eat grass<br>  Highland cows have lots of hair|`|gWM7ONhBaa	cows are a species of cow.|`|UiPfzlkTaa	a leg at each corner, a tail at one end and a head at the other, hope that helps you..++++|`|b02b38cdc8ae5b03ef91682d21321d20aa	<a href="http://www.buelingo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buelingo.com/</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|eKRoN1b2aa	The meat along a cow's spine can be cut into small round sections known as fillet steaks.|`|zXnyQx0iaa	it all depends what u need to know i know a lot about cows i milked for 4 years|`|jDPVcaKUaa	Ur mom <br>  <br>  A* grade|`|9p7eUgYqaa	Bluelingo cattle are beef cattle that were developed in North Dakota.

lMN59lv2aa	Crews? You're joking, right? You DO know that humans have never travelled beyond Earth's gravity well, yes?<br>  <br>  To date, there have been four UNMANNED missions to Saturn.<br>  <br>  Pioneer 11: Launched on Apr 6, 1973. It first flew by Jupiter on Dec 4, 1974, then flew by Saturn on Sep 1, 1979.<br>  <br>  Voyager 1: Launched Sep 5, 1977. It also flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn. It visited Jupiter on Mar 5, 1979 and flew past Saturn on Nov 12, 1980.<br>  <br>  Voyager 2: Launched Aug 20, 1977. This spacecraft flew the "Grand Tour" of the outer planets, taking advantage of a rare planetary configuration that allowed gravity assists from each planet on the way. It flew by Jupiter on July 9, 1979; Saturn on Aug 26, 1981; Uranus on Jan 24, 1986; and Neptune on Aug 25, 1989.<br>  <br>  Currently, the Cassini-Huygens mission is still underway. The spacecraft consisted of an orbiter (Cassini) that is currently circling the ringed planet, and a probe (Huygens) that descended to the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. The mission launched on Oct 15, 1997. Cassini went into orbit on July 1, 2004. The Huygens probe landed on Titan on Jan 14, 2005. The mission was originally scheduled to end in 2008, but was extended until at least 2010. Unlike the other three Saturn spacecraft which are on their way out of the Solar System, the Cassini spacecraft will continue to orbit Saturn after the mission ends.<br>  <br>  There have been two unmanned missions to Mercury.<br>  <br>  Mariner 10: Launched Nov 3, 1973. After a Venus fly-by on Feb 5, 1974, it flew by Mercury three times: Mar 29, 1974, Sep 21, 1974, and Mar 16, 1975. The spacecraft is still orbiting the sun.<br>  <br>  The MESSENGER mission is currently underway. It was launched on Aug 3, 2004, and had a complex trajectory of gravity-assists that included an Earth fly-by on Aug 2, 2005 and two Venus fly-bys on Oct 24, 2006 and June 5, 2007. It made the first of three Mercury fly-bys on Jan 14, 2008 and the second on Oct 6, 2008. The third will be on Sep 29 of this year, and finally, on Mar 18, 2011, it is scheduled to go into orbit around the smallest of the eight planets. (Man, that still sounds weird to this long-time astronomy buff...)<br>  <br>  The achievements of these missions are far too numerous to list here.

However the other sentence ("A line passing through the origin has slope 2.") does make sense.<br>  <br>  The general equation for a line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.  Since the slope is 2, that means y = 2x + b.  And since (0,0) is a point on the line, then 0 = 2(0) + b, so b=0.

Our electronic emissions have relatively short transmission range of detectability in space. As someone already said, by the time that "we" detect such signals from another world, the intelligence that sent the messages is probably long dead and gone.<br>  <br>  Advanced planetary societies are not likely to still be using radio waves as a functional means of communications; they are more likely to be using technology based upon enhanced remote viewing or communications based upon quantum entanglement or quantum holographics, or simply warping space-time for some form of teleportation process. Our technology would be likely 1000s of years more primitive compared to theirs.  It would be similar to someone in the 1860 using telegraph wire and code key to try and intercept one of our moder satellite cell phone links.

The problem is that the vastness of space will give us some grief in finding anything interesting... and even if we did detect something the odds are that the species who emitted it is already dead.<br>  <br>  For example if we detected radio waves and found out that it came from the Andromeda Galaxy (the closest galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy) then the radio waves would have been emitted at least 2.5 million years ago. In 2.5 million years, their planet may have already been engulfed by their sun... and be long since dead.<br>  <br>  So SETI is only really useful in searching for intelligent life in our own Galaxy... and given the rarity of life, I would say that the odds of finding an 'intelligent' neighbour in the Milky Way alone is quite slim.|`|6da136429953fa0aaf7405c93b94bdb5aa	Trying and failing is not failure.<br>  Failure is not trying.<br>  All science advancement is based on trial and error.<br>  As Thomas Edison replied when asked about the time and effort and money he spent inventing the light bulb, " I have not failed, I have just found 10,000 ways that don't work."|`|KHSOVxViaa	If we find something, society will judge no.<br>  <br>  If we don't, then they'll say yes.<br>  <br>  Taxpayers are fickle and expect forward hindsight.<br>  <br>  Personally I think it's a good idea; even if we don't eventually find anything, we were right to try.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Yes, waste time and money, if life of other planets, it probably not send messages, NASA not have SETI.|`|iraiRVT1aa	no it is great and terrific effort!

Most exams are targted to a region, let's say the lumbar and sacral spine.  Sometimes,however, your physician will want a full spine which may take as much as 45 minutes or so to do.<br>  <br>  3) After a scan, the results are generally made available to the ordering physician in 48 to 72 hours.<br>  <br>  I wish you well and hope this was somewhat helpful.

AA11403032	No.  He can never get out because he can only ever jump half the distance needed to get  out.<br>  <br>  The highest he can ever get is 20 metres from the top.

THIS ANSWER IS CORRECT.  THE ONES ABOVE ARE HOPELESSLY WRONG.<br>  <br>  UPDATE...now Jake has it right too.|`|Ub7RlKAAaa	He starts off by jumping 30m and then falling down 15m. So the first term is 30 - 15 = 15. <br>  On his next jump he jumps 22.5m, so he reaches 37.5m, and then falls down half of that, to leave him at 18.75.<br>  On his next jump, he jumps 20.625m leaving him at 39.375m before falling half way down.<br>  So the distance he gets every time goes 30, 7.5, 1.875. So this is a geometric progression with first term 30 and common ratio 1/4.<br>  Sum to infinity = a/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.<br>  S(inf) = 30/(3/4)<br>  = 40<br>  So he gets 40m up the wall at one stage, which is 2/3rds of the distance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you and your son! :)|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	The frog's position after he slips back at the nth try is (1/3)(1-1/4^n), which means it will end up jumping up to the 40 meter mark only to slip back to the 20 meter mark, like almost all the answerers have pointed out.<br>  <br>  I doubt if this is "your son's home work" if he's still in some public school in America.|`|Sn9KZ8ANaa	Since he jumps only half the way no matter where he is, he'll never reach the top.

He then slides down half the distance of the bottom to his location e.g. for the 2nd jump again, he is now 37.5m from the bottom, so half of this is 18.75m, and he slides down for this length which is 37.5m - 18.75 which leaves him at 18.75m from the bottom.<br>  <br>  1st jump = 0m + (60/2)m - [(60/2)/2] = 30m - 15m = 15m<br>  <br>  2nd jump = 15m + [(60 - 15)/2]m - {[15 + (60 - 15)/2]/2}m = 15m + 22.5m - 18.75m = 18.75m<br>  <br>  3rd jump = 18.75m + [(60 - 18.75)/2]m - {[18.75 + (60 - 18.75)/2]/2}m = 18.75m + 20.625m - 19.6875= 19.6875<br>  <br>  4th jump= 19.6875m + [(60 - 19.6875)/2]m - {[19.6875 + (60 - 19.6875)/2]/2} = 19.6875 + 20.15625 - 19.921875 = 19.921875m<br>  <br>  sorry about all the brackets, but I didn't want to skip any steps and confuse you as a result<br>  anyway, as you can see the distance the frog is covering is increasing every time, but the amount it increases by gets smaller and smaller every time. But notice that even though the decimal gets smaller and smaller, it will never reach 0. That means that the frog will eventually get up to the top (i think, or it could be one of those things where he will approach it but never reach it..) but it'll take him a lot of jumps. Actually, I think he'll get nearer and nearer to it but never reach it. yep.<br>  <br>  sorry, I hope you understood some of that, and I hope it helped|`|ISKM1z8iaa	In theory, the frog will never jump out of the well, he will get closer and closer each time, but will never leave the well.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Mathematically, the frog will never get out of the well, since it will always only jump half of the remaining distance. When it gets to a fraction of an inch, it will still be only half of that from the problem's premises. Practically of course, this is an "impossible" problem. If the frog can jump 30m on it's first jump, it can certainly jump a fraction of an inch for a last jump...

lMN59lv2aa	Humans are the only animals that appear to naturally use a complex, symbolic language.<br>  <br>  However, there have been language studies with other animals, chiefly with other great apes, where it seems they can be taught to understand and use language.<br>  <br>  The most famous of these is probably Kanzi, who is a bonobo (sometimes called a "pygmy chimpanzee") of the species Pan paniscus. Kanzi communicates via a keyboard that contains "lexicons," which is kind of like a heiroglyphic writing system. Unlike many previous ape language studies, Kanzi has show the ability to understand abstract concepts. Also in contrast to many previous studies, Kanzi was not intentionally taught to use lexicons at first. As an infant, he was present with his mother while she was being taught. Apparently, like humans, bonobos have a "golden age" of mental development, during which they can quickly learn communication skills. Kanzi began using the lexicons spontaneously, and only then did researchers focus on teaching him further.<br>  <br>  Kanzi has a rudimentary grammar in his sentence construction, following a general pattern of subject–action–object. He also shows a high aptitude for understanding spoken English. There are several videos available on YouTube:<br>  <br>  Kanzi repeating spoken words on his keyboard:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxmbjLoUnhk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxmbjLoUn...</a><br>  <br>  Kanzi following spoken instructions:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dhc2zePJFE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dhc2zePJ...</a><br>  <br>  Great Ape Trust channel:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GreatApeTrust" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/GreatApeTrus...</a><br>  <br>  Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, who has worked with Kanzi since his infancy, claims that Kanzi also attempts to vocalize in English, and although I'm not aware of any proper experiments with controls (which would be difficult, as his vocal tract doesn't allow for pronunciation of most consonants — as with children with severe speech impediments, only people intimately familiar with his vocalizations are able to understand him), it does indeed seem that when Dr. Rumbaugh responds to these vocalizations, Kanzi is pleased with the result.<br>  <br>  Other great apes who have shown some degree of linguistic ability include Washoe, a common chimpanzee, and Koko, a lowland gorilla. In both of these cases, they were taught to use words from American Sign Language, but neither has shown nearly the aptitude that Kanzi has demonstrated, perhaps because they were not exposed to language as infants.|`|fF1WbPltaa	That's more or less correct.

IR57GfWUaa	Both are acid-base reactions -_-|`|2guacbkWaa	Agreed with the first answer. It is acid base reactions. But there are some needs correction. 1) NaOH doesn't change to salt and water just by its own. It's need to react with acid in this case is Chloride Acid or HCl. The reaction between NaOH and HCl is known as reaction between strong acid and strong base and also known as neutralization reaction.<br>  <br>  2) Reaction between H+ and NH4OH can be consider as strong acid and weak base reaction but also can be consider as weak acid and weak base reaction depend on the type of H+. If H+ is HCl or HNO3 or H2SO4 or HBr means that H+ is strong acid. But if the H+ is H2CO3 or CH3COOH means that H+ is weak acid.<br>  <br>  In chemistry every reaction needs to be correct and balance, or we will never achieve the right answer.

2lQ8DJAcaa	How do the movements of the sun and the moon affect tide? The gravitational pull of the moon tugs on the surface of the ocean until its surface mounds up and outward in the direction of the moon. When the mound of water has reached its highest point it is called high tide. On the opposite side of the earth from the moon, the centrifugal force caused by the earth's rotation produces another mound of water and high tide. Between these two high tides are two flat areas on the surface of the ocean which are the low tides.<br>  <br>  Each day there are two high tides and two low tides. The time between high and low tide is a little over 6 hours and the entire tidal cycle repeats itself four times each day. The regularity of the tides corresponds to the regular orbit of the moon around the earth and the rotation of the earth as it orbits around the sun. <br>  <br>  Depending upon the position of the moon relative to the earth and sun, a moon can have different phases. The phases of the moon are also very regular, and have been used for thousands of years to keep track of time using the lunar calendar. In addition to the daily movements of the moon, these monthly lunar cycles can also impact the tides.|`|De4vgWXPaa	Yes, it happens to be the major cause of them by exerting gravity.  That pulls the water upwards towards the Moon, and results in tides.|`|AA12198742	It does indeed!  Any object with mass has gravity (even if it's minniscule) and the moon is no exception. That gravitational pull does attract the water and so when a part of earth faces the moon, it has water piled up on that side. As the earth rotates throughout the 24 hr day, different parts have water piled up. Oddly, when one side of earth has a high tide, the exact opposite side does as well.|`|c3Q5Oxvfaa	Yes.<br>  <a href="http://videos.howstuffworks.com/hsw/10000-the-moon-tides-video.htm" rel="nofollow">http://videos.howstuffworks.com/hsw/1000...</a>

lQao8Wt0aa	The earth's gravitational pull on the moon is nearly 200 times the sun's !

Asking 'Why doesn't the Sun pull the Moon away from the Earth?' makes no more sense than asking 'Why doesn't the Earth pull astronauts away from the International Space Station?', and for the same reasons.|`|UkjnSyAvaa	So when the moon is on the sun-side of the earth, you would think it would get pulled away. After all, the moon *is* being pulled more by the sun than by the earth when it is on the sun-side. This was one of Ralph Rene's reasons for claiming that Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation was flawed.  However...<br>  <br>  If the earth was not orbiting the sun, the moon *would* be pulled into the sun. So would the earth. The reason they both stay in orbit is because they are moving around the sun at an average speed of 30 km per second.  The moon's orbital velocity around the earth is only about 1 km per second. So at new moon, it is moving at about 29 km per second WRT the sun. At full moon, it is moving at about 31 km per second WRT the sun. In other words, if you removed the earth completely, the moon would continue in a nearly circular solar orbit on its own.<br>  <br>  This is one of the many things the very outspoken Ralph Rene didn't have a clue about.|`|TuR5vMuzaa	Its bcz the gravitational pull of earth on Moon is much greater than  the  sun has it on Moon.More ever what matters is distance.If moon is at 2.25 million miles sun is at 9 million miles away.<br>  In fact when Moon was first formed it was much closer to earth .<br>  Moon is slipping away from earth  at the rate of 1 to 2 inches per year.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	Mas attracts mass not repel it.|`|ANOkEVoPaa	Because the moon is much closer to earth than the sun, the gravitational pull of the earth on the moon is much stronger than the gravitational force of the sun on the moon even though earth and moon are held in space by the sun. Remember that the moon revolves around the earth once every 28 days (or close to that) and so the moon spends only a few days between earth and sun (which is why we get solar eclipses). When sun, earth and moon are nearly perfectly lined up with the earth between the moon and sun, the moon experiences both the gravity of earth and sun in the same direction. But the moon doesn't come crashing into earth because of the centripetal force caused by moon's revolution around earth. It is the balance of earth's gravity and the centripetal force of moon's motion that keeps the moon in earth's orbit.

Its two record-setting spans of 521 m (1,710 ft) were the longest in existence until 1917. The arched Eads Bridge over the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri, designed by James Eads and completed in 1874, was the first steel bridge in the United States. The Eads Bridge has three main spans. The center span is 160 m (520 ft) long, and the spans on either side are each 153 m (502 ft) in length. At the time the Eads Bridge was built, it was the longest structure in the United States. By 1890 the strength and lightness of steel had made it the material of choice for bridge building.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	and American Chinese T.Y.

Tancred–Arrol, constructed the bridge, robustly designed in the aftermath of the Tay Bridge disaster by civil engineers Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker. The balanced cantilever principle was adopted. The main crossing comprises tubular struts and lattice-girder ties in three double-cantilevers each connected by 105 m. (345 ft.) ‘suspended’ girder spans resting on the cantilever ends and secured by man-sized pins. The outside double-cantilever shoreward ends carry weights of about 1000 tonnes to counter-balance half the weight of the suspended span and live load.

qFdS8YzQaa	I don't see any environmental issues with Scots Pine or Beech Wood.<br>  <br>  Pines<br>  The Pines are a large and diverse group of evergreen conifers with over eighty species in the northern hemisphere and across the equator to Java. The Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) is the only native to Britain, however, there are a large number of other species commonly planted as garden, park and forest trees, many of which grow to a similarly large size. Pines are important wildlife trees, particularly in the north, where they provide some of the last outposts for the endangered red squirrel in the UK.<br>  <br>  The Scots Pine is distinctive because of its ornamental, bright orange bark in the upper crown and pale greenish–brown needles. It grows rapidly and can reach heights of around 115ft. It rarely exceeds a life span of 250 years except in exposed areas, where its growth is stunted and thereby slowed. <br>  <br>  The native Scots Pine woodlands are now a rarity, as the timber they produce is of a high quality and in great demand. It is a tree commonly found in the Highlands and the lochs and rivers were ideal for floating the logs to be processed. The timber is used for buildings, ships' masts, charcoal, flaming torches, chipboard, boxes, fencing, telegraph poles and furniture and the tree has also proved a good source of turpentine, resin and tar.<br>  <br>  The Corsican Pine (Pinus nigra var. maritima) is an evergreen conifer which is native to Corsica and Southern Italy. It is widely grown in parks, gardens, church yards and as shelter belts or commercial plantations in the UK. As a plantation, they provide very suitable habitats for deer and birds. It is found on most soil types including heavy clays, sand, chalk and shallow peats. <br>  <br>  The Corsican Pine is a large tree reaching an average of 115ft in height, the tallest recorded in the UK being 145ft tall. However, the trees need plenty of light to grow quickly and in plantations they need to be thinned out carefully.<br>  <br>  The timber is used to make pit props and in general building work. As plywood, thin strips of wood are shaved from the log in a spiral and glued together to form layers. The opposite angled grain in successive layers provides its strength.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Beech<br>  The Common Beech (Fagus sylvatica) is a native tree to southern England and is typical in size and form to forest trees. Its smooth, silvery trunk can be stunning and seen from miles around. It grows well on chalk downs or acidic soils and is an expert at seeking water. The Beech bears more shade than any other native tree except for Holly (Ilex spp) and Yew (Taxus spp) and although it can grow up under any tree, none other can grow in its shade. The tallest recorded tree in England is 150ft and Beech can reach 20 feet around their stems. The oldest surviving tree in Britain is said to be over 320 years old (although the average life span is around 250 years) and the tallest maintained hedge to be found is up to 105ft.<br>  <br>  Beech play host to an unfortunately large number of wood decay fungi and other pests and diseases and mature to over mature trees can die quite quickly following infection from certain fungal species.<br>  <br>  Beech wood is very pliable and bends easily, making it ideal for turning or furniture making.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Pinewoods in the UK, especially Scotland, are home to some important plants such as Linnaea borealis (Twin Flower) and Moneses uniflora (One-flowered Wintergreen). Birds such as Crested Tit are rarely found anywhere else whilst the Scottish Crossbill occurs no where else in the world. Scotland's pinewoods are also home to some spectacular insects, with hoverflies such as Melangyna ericarum and Hammerschmidtia ferrugineum restricted to these forests.<br>  <br>  Beechwoods are also home to rare plants such as the Ghost Orchid (Epipogium aphyllum). The Yellow Bird's Nest (Monotropa hypopitys) rarely occurs outside beech or pine woods.<br>  <br>  Environmental issues should involve the proper management of these woodlands in order to safeguard their wildlife.

At least one Babylonian tablet states that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the perimeter of an inscribed hexagon is (in modern notation) 1:0.96, implying a value of p=3.125, a value that is too small by about half a percent.

Around 480, the Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi gave the approximation π = 355/113, and showed that 3.1415926 < π < 3.1415927, which would stand as the most accurate value for π over the next 900 years."<br>  <br>  π is a letter in the Greek alphabet.<br>  <br>  "The Greek letter π, often spelled out pi in text, was adopted for the number from the Greek word for perimeter "περ?μετρο?", probably by William Jones in 1706, and popularized by Leonhard Euler some years later."<br>  <br>  (22/7)/π - 1 = 4.024994e-4<br>  3.14/π - 1 = -5.069573e-4<br>  so 22/7 is more accurate, but not by much.<br>  355/113 - 1 = 8.491368e-8, which is more accurate by nearly 4 orders of magnitude.|`|97ca6663adad94c1f5fa4d010bf0ce51aa	<a href="http://ualr.edu/lasmoller/pi.html" rel="nofollow">http://ualr.edu/lasmoller/pi.html</a>|`|QMhl2DGQaa	greek|`|GHD8JicSaa	You could say the Greeks were the first to us Pi as it was one of their letters so they used it as a letter.

It got voted down.   <br>  <br>  The Egyptians used measuring wheels to determine length.   As you rolled the wheel along,  it automatically "added" in the exact measurement of Pi.   Of course the Egyptians did not know that.  However if you go and measure the pyramids and reduce down to the lowest common denominators in the measurements,  one of the numbers is Pi.   That has led some to believe that the Egyptians knew exactly what Pi was.   They did not,  it just came about from using wheels to measure stuff.  <br>  <br>  However, there was a reference in a Middle Kingdom Papyrus scroll from 1650 BCE that gave it as 3.1604.

uPVnqbE8aa	I'm afraid "Kayla" is wrong on some issues.<br>  The female Black Widow Spider (Latrodectus mactans) does not have a red hour glass on her "back", it's on her ventral surface under her abdomen.  She does only occasionally eat the male, but not always.  If he breaks some kind of spider rule  then she grabs him and he becomes a good source of protein for her soon-to-develop eggs.<br>  Neither Black Widow Spiders "or" Coral Snakes bite people very often and both are non aggressive.  <br>  It is hard to say which venom is more serious, since a lot depends on the health and age of the victim.  The venom of Black Widows causes a great deal of pain and discomfort and attacks the red blood cells as well as the nerves, and this creates problems for the doctors trying to cure the effects.<br>  The venom of a Coral Snake, on the other hand, is entirely neurotoxic and attacks only the nerves.  It is far less painful than that of the Black Widow, and the anti-venine that most hospitals carry will take care of it if injected within a reasonable time.  <br>  People "can" die if bitten by either animal but it is rare.  Coral Snakes are very docile and will not bite unless handled, while, on the other hand, Black Widow Spiders often hang around human habitations and get into places like empty shoes or closets where they can come into contact with a human being and therefore bite out of self defense.  Neither animal will chase humans or seek them out, or bite for no reason.  And, both creatures are good for the environment.  The spider helps control the insects pest populations like Cockroaches, Termites, Flies, Fleas, Gnats, Mosquitoes, etc.  The snake helps to keep the mouse and rat populations under control, along with other small rodents and Mammals.  <br>  The venom of both the Black Widow Spider and the Coral Snake is to aid them in catching and killing their prey, and is not "intended" to hurt humans.|`|Rc7Gyqj9aa	im sorry, i'm no scientist, but i have dealt with black widows before. black widows are very venomous for all I know. they are usual spotted black with a red hourglass on its back. you see female spiders the most because they eat the male spiders after the give birth, which is why they are called widows. females and males both bite, but the females is worse. also, they are so dangerous because people don't usual realize they they are bitten, so they don't get medical care right away. <br>  coral snakes on the other hand are lethal. they can't bite through thick material such as jeans, so people are rarely bitten by these snakes. <br>  so i would say coral snakes are worse, but people get bitten by black widows more

The relative concentrations of these carbon-containing species depend on the pH; bicarbonate predominates within the range 6.36-10.25 in fresh water.<br>  <br>  All waters in contact with the atmosphere absorb carbon dioxide, and as these waters come into contact with rocks and sediments they acquire metal ions, most commonly calcium and magnesium, so most natural waters that come from streams, lakes, and especially wells, can be regarded as dilute solutions of these bicarbonates. These hard waters tend to form carbonate scale in pipes and boilers and they react with soaps to form an undesirable scum.<br>  <br>  Attempts to prepare compounds such as calcium bicarbonate by evaporating its solution to dryness invariably yield the solid carbonate instead: Ca(HCO3)2(aq) → CO2(g) + H2O(l) + CaCO3(s). Very few solid bicarbonates other than those of the alkali metals and ammonium ion are known to exist.<br>  <br>  The above reaction is very important to the formation of stalactites, stalagmites, columns, and other speleothems within caves and, for that matter, in the formation of the caves themselves. As water containing carbon dioxide (including extra CO2 acquired from soil organisms) passes through limestone or other calcium carbonate containing minerals, it dissolves part of the calcium carbonate and hence becomes richer in bicarbonate. As the groundwater enters the cave, the excess carbon dioxide is released from the solution of the bicarbonate, causing the much less soluble calcium carbonate to be deposited.<br>  <br>  *** Copied from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_bicarbonate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_bic...</a> ***|`|YVmAKb8Eaa	Calcium carbonate is a salt.<br>  <br>  Its most common natural forms are chalk, limestone, and marble, produced by the sedimentation of the shells of small fossilized snails, shellfish, and coral over millions of years.

57iuuloVaa	In the 4th Century B.C., Aristotle proposed that earthquakes were caused by winds trapped in subterranean caves. Small tremors were thought to have been caused by air pushing on the cavern roofs, and large ones by the air breaking the surface. This theory lead to a belief in earthquake weather, that because a large amount of air was trapped underground, the weather would be hot and calm before an earthquake.<br>  <br>  A later theory stated that earthquakes occurred in calm, cloudy conditions, and were usually preceded by strong winds, fireballs, and meteors. There is no connection between weather and earthquakes. They are the result of geologic processes within the earth and can happen in any weather and at any time during the year.|`|2eztcCO0aa	Does that happen?  I've never heard of that.

lMN59lv2aa	Unfortunately, there is not such a simple method for determing strong acids from empirical formula. However, if you have access to a table of their dissociation constants (pKa), the determination IS simple... if the pKa is less than or equal to that of the hydronium ion (H3O+, pKa = –1.74), the acid is strong.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, the only recourse is to memorize the common strong acids.

Quantum theory suggests that if an atom A emits a photon, which is later absorbed by another atom B, it can be said that atom B has absorbed a photon because atom A emitted, and it can equally be said that atom A emittied a photon because atom B is going to absorb it.  In other words, an atom in a distant star has emitted a photon because millions of years later I'm here to discern it!  So far, no experiment has debunked this crazy finding, and yet nobody in the physics community has been able to explain it in an intuitive way, only that the mathematics works out.  This is related to non-locality experiments in quantum physics, something Einstein had predicted would NOT prove to be true, after he showed that such experiments would be predicted by the mathematics of quantum physics.  <br>  <br>  It is one of the great ironies of physics that Einstein had so loathed quantum mechanics, and yet was responsible for two of its most important discoveries, the photoelectric effect and the EPR "paradox".|`|UkjnSyAvaa	The biggest mystery of all is how it all began.

Again, the word "caused" might not even be applicable, as our vocabulary and ability to conceptualize are both contained *within* the universe and there is no "outside" from which to perceive it.<br>  <br>  By the way, I wanted to say that I appreciate the kinds of questions you are asking today. We get so much brain-dead stuff and all those questions about Nibiru and 2012, etc. And then there are the lazy people who want us to do their homework for them.

In my opinion time is a man made thing, it had be created in to permit the calculation of speed. Have a look at the big bang. When the singularity cooled to the point where the fist sub atomic particles formed, three things took place, one, gravity was created, two space was created, three motion took place. All that a particle required for motion was space, time was not needed. When the first particles began to move this was the beginning of events taking place. Time is nothing more than the sequence of events, there is no way to measure any delay in events, there are no. delays. Earth is a mere speck in the universe. Why does it need time zones?|`|AA10349979	what is one of the biggest mysteries a about space-time is what was before the big bang considering that space & time was non-existent before that event had happened.|`|AA11564934	what is gravity?

UFteXlqwaa	You are right, when hanged, the person falls and die from breaking the neck. The rope is only to hold the head while the weight of the body snaps the vertebrae of the neck thus severing all nerve impulses from the brain to the body.<br>  <br>  This is called in French, "le coup du lapin" (the rabbit's strike) and apparently a normal way to kill rabbits by a blow on the upper vertebrae of the neck.<br>  <br>  However, and until the end of Franco's regime, Spain had still "la garota" as a way to kill people. That was a steel stripe that was slowly tied around the neck of the person, suffocating him or her, very slowly. <br>  <br>  In that case, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen and goes fibrillating, which, in turn decreases the oxygen to the brain and one faints shortly before the heart gives up and stops beating.|`|AA10119874	With hanging the neck is broken so all muscles below the neck don't work.

79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Actually, if I recall correctly, some extrasolar planets smaller than the Earth have been discovered. However, both of them are orbiting a neutron star and are not good candidates for having native life forms.<br>  <br>  However, the Kepler space telescope, which was just launched yesterday, is designed to detect terrestrial-type planets orbiting other stars. It will spend several years staring at about a hundred thousand stars in a particular patch of sky and measuring the light levels of each star to find transiting planets. Although the vast majority of terrestrial-type planets orbiting those stars would not be transiting planets (i.e. their orbits would not take them between their star and the Kepler telescope), a hundred thousand stars is still enough stars to get a fairly good statistical sample, and astronomers expect to see at least a few dozen to a few hundred terrestrial-type planets using the Kepler telescope.<br>  <br>  >Is there a chance that our closest neighbour star might have an Earth orbiting it but we just can't spot it yet?<br>  <br>  That is extremely unlikely. The closest star to us is Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf star on a very wide orbit in the Alpha Centauri system, which also contains two other stars. The chances of a planet forming and surviving in a stable orbit in such a system are quite small.<br>  <br>  That said, you don't have to go very far, in an astronomical sense, to find nice planets. Two of the best candidate planets for life forms outside the Solar System are orbiting a solitary red dwarf star called Gliese 581 a, about 20 light years away (five times as far away as Proxima Centauri).<br>  <br>  >Also, if we did find a planet today in the 'goldilocks' zone, and of the proper size, is our level of technology good enough to determine if there is water, or even life on that planet?<br>  <br>  Possibly. If the planet was a transiting planet, then during a transit it would be possible to look at the light coming from the star and being filtered through the planet's atmosphere, and from the absorption lines in that spectrum we might be able to determine what chemicals are present in the atmosphere. This has already been used to find evidence of some chemicals in the atmospheres of certain extrasolar gas giant planets, but it would be harder to use on a smaller planet due to having a smaller atmosphere cross-section to work with. Furthermore, it would only give us information about the planet's atmosphere; whether or not oceans or life forms existed on its surface would be far harder to discern from where we are.|`|AA11863643	Yes.  Once such planets are located, for example by the upcoming Kepler mission,  it will be fairly easy to analyse their emission spectra to determine what gasses are in their atmosphere.  This will allow us to determine if life is present.|`|BuvQ8tuuaa	Almost, but not just yet.  Within 20 years we should be able to more adequately locate Earth-like planets but we will probably still be unable to make any further determinations such as water content, atmospheric composition, and whether or not life exists on said planet.  <br>  <br>  Even if we found an Earth-like planet tomorrow we couldn't do anything about it, except try to send radio messages there...and wait around 50 years for a reply, presuming there is anyone there detecting the signals we sent out.|`|xFdz9CMKaa	Short answer apparently is yes.|`|VYGViBb6aa	well yes if it is close enough then we can send a probe to drill down infact they sent up a telescope today to look for new planets like our own but if we find a new one it would need clean water atmosphere light plants meat and most of all oxygen but i think there probably is a planet like ours out there i mean they think mars once held life because it used to be the same temperature as ours!!|`|flGXcxwGaa	Yes and no,<br>  <br>  We have the technology to be able to find planets and to analyze their atmosphere, use satellites to doing image analysis, and many drone type robots and robots with enough imputed knowledge to drive around and so on and analyzing the soil, air, checking for water and so on even with cameras to take pictures and so on. So we have the technology to do so.<br>  <br>  No however on us being able to find one. So far we have not found a earth like planet but we have found ones similar in some ways just has somethings like poisonous gases and so on.<br>  <br>  I do believe however that we have not found any suns of the right size, heat, and distance from their surrounding plantets to support life.<br>  <br>  Earth has the right atmosphere and resources and the sun if the right shape and heat and distance. We are a low chance on the statistics.<br>  <br>  However if Einstein was correct about other times and universes that abide by different laws then maybe other planets are closer then we think we just can travel fast enough or no how to do it. Then it would not be a matter of distance but speed.|`|udPENhCxaa	I hope we don't find it. Humans are parasites.

lMN59lv2aa	H2O3??<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure the problem said "H2SO4"... so I'll assume that's what you meant.<br>  <br>  1) The first step in this type of problem must ALWAYS be to balance the equation. Don't take this for granted, or it could nail you on an exam. In this case, it already is.<br>  <br>  2) Since chemical equations show MOLAR ratios, you must next determine how many moles of H2SO4 you are attempting to neutralize. To do this, divide the mass by the molar weight.<br>  <br>  The molar weight of sulfuric acid is 98.08 g/mol. So:<br>  <br>   49 g<br>  ————— = 0.4996 mols of H2SO4.<br>  98.08 g/mol<br>  <br>  3) The next step is to look at the molar ratios (the coefficients) in your balanced equation. In this case, for every one mole of H2SO4, you need two of KOH; so the molar ratio is 2/1 or simply 2.<br>  <br>  Multiply the moles of H2SO4 by this number to determine how many moles of KOH you need:<br>  <br>  0.4996 x 2 = 0.9992 mol KOH<br>  <br>  4) Next, determine the mass of KOH by multiplying the number of moles by the molecular weight:<br>  <br>  0.9992 mol x 56.11 g/mol = 56.07 g KOH.<br>  <br>  5) Finally, remember to round to the appropriate significant figures. Since you only have two sig figs given, your answer must be given with 2 sig figs:<br>  <br>  1.0 mol KOH required<br>  56 g KOH required<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

sKXzYvaRaa	Power dissipation = i^2 * r<br>  <br>  So if you can trade off current for voltage you will have less loss in your power transmission.|`|SYZQZGesaa	Simple answer - voltage is the force. Imagine you have a water pipe and it has a small hole. Only so much water can flow out of that hole in a period of time. If all of your flow were equal to or less than that rate, then all the water could flow out. If, on the other hand, you use high pressure water, then the hole will not lose that much.  Think of the venturi effect.|`|oXPDFw4daa	Higher voltage translates into lower currents.<br>  <br>  If currents are lower, resistive losses (I^2R) are therefore lower.|`|57iuuloVaa	P= IR.............1<br>  <br>  P = .........2<br>  <br>  Where R is the resistance of the transmission system (not the load)<br>  <br>  So for a fixed transmission resistance<br>  <br>  Equation 1 tells us that the power lost increases with the square of the current, multiplied by the transmission resistance, R<br>  <br>  Equation 2 tells us that the power lost increases with the square of the voltage divided by the transmission resistance, R<br>  <br>  These equations further tell us that the power loss due to any increase in current will be multiplied by the resistance, whereas any increase in power loss due to an increase in voltage will be divided by the resistance.<br>  <br>  So the more we increase the current the more we multiply the power loss, the more we decrease the current and hence increase the voltage the more we divide the power loss.<br>  <br>  So high voltage reduces power losses in the transmission lines (only when the power is constant)...|`|278PAUbkaa	voltage is not lowered by the resistance in the lines unlike current is. if you sent a high current the power would be lost due to heat caused by  the resistance in lines. think of voltage as pressure, and current, as well, current. if you put a dam in a river, the pressure of the water is not changed, but the current is significantly reduced, think of the resistance in power lines as a dam.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	The higher the voltage the lower the current over the resistance of the lines.E=IRthe power is the current times the voltage.
AWPaPV4Eaa	You could see what the oxidation potential for one (or all) of those metals is as you vary the pH of the solution.  So your independent variable would be pH, and your dependent one would be oxidation potential (it is very difficult to reduce Al, Zn or even Fe in aqueous solution, so your experiment should probably oxidize these metals).  I would expect the potential to vary with pH because different species will be formed by metal ions in solutions of different pH (eg. Al(OH)4 - vs Al3+ for aluminum(III) ions).  Since all of the metals you can use are more reactive than silver, an Ag/Ag+ electrode would probably be good as a reference.<br>  <br>  So to set up the experiment, you could put the testing metal in a beaker with a 1M solution of a salt (should use the nitrate, as this will be soluble with the Ag+ in the other beaker) of that metal (ferrous salt for iron, rather than ferric).  Next, place an Ag wire in a beaker with a 1M solution of AgNO3, and then connect the two beakers with a salt bridge.  Connect the two electrodes through a voltmeter and measure the potential difference.  You could then vary the pH of the beaker with the metal you are testing in it by adding nitric acid or sodium hydroxide, measure the pH, then measure the potential again.  An electronic pH (itself an electrochemical device) meter would be useful here.<br>  <br>  If you find a metal that has a predictable response to pH, then you could propose this system as a good one for a pH meter to use - by measuring the potential difference, you could figure out what the pH is.<br>  <br>  Note that Fe, Zn, and Al will dissolve in strongly acidic media (weak/dilute acids should be fine) and Al and Zn will dissolve in strongly basic media (again, weakly basic solutions should be fine).
3zZ6nyuRaa	just remember your dependant variables are what happened when u switched bowls. the independant variables are what you did to make the experiment (procedure, technique) like modifying what he was drinking out of, switching it and so on
