20090308105829AAJIePK	Consumer Electronics;TVs	LCD TV SIGNAL PROBLEM?	I have a Toshiba 23hlv87 ( a 23 inch Toshiba LCD w/Built in DVD)   Worked fine on all levels for two years.It has been mounted so no fall/drop or damage has occurred, however warranty is out now...and it will play DVDs from an HDMI source and games as well (works fine with my PS3 for games/movies) but when trying a TV signal from a variety of input sources (HDMI,S-VIDEO, & ColorstreamHD) I am able to get sound...but the screen freezes with a bunch of colors...no picture. I've tried the same tv signal input on a different lcd tv and it worked just fine. ALSO, the same issue (I get audio but no video) occures when using the built in DVD player...but again playing DVD's from outside source works fine.   I am not too knowledgeable about TV related things...but my wife took it to some repair guy who barely looked it over but said it seems the motherboard is out and replacing it would run about as much as it would cost me to buy a new one on sale. I'd like to know if it's possible AND realistic to simply purchase a new motherboard for it, and try replacing it myself. I tried looking up LCD TV motherboards via Google...and usually find stuff for the laptops...so no luck there. EXPERTS....ANY and ALL feedback/insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and have a great day!

Hi,I have a 60GB Xbox 360 that has already been updated with the New Xbox Experience update(I did it yesterday).      You may be wondering why I took soo long to get this update,it because I'm not connected to Xbox LIVE.      That means ALL updates and patches will not be present in my Xbox 360 console.

20090306220027AAp4R9q	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Questions About XBOX 360?	So im thinking of getting a standard 60GB XBOX 360 but i want to know a few things first.      1. What resolution are (most) games in? full-HD?      2. Secondly what type of cables does the standard xbox 360 come with to connect to a TV? I have an HDTV so i'd be opting for a HDMI cable. Does the standard xbox 360 come with an HDMI cable? And, do i need a seperate cable for audio (e.g optical/digital) or can i just use the same HDMI cable?      3. Next, will i be able to play XBOX 1 games on the 360? I've heard you can download them from XBOX Live, is this free?      4. I've also heard that you can copy games to the hard drive so you dont have to use a disc anymore. Is this true? And can you do it with XBOX 1 games?      5. Relating to the questions above, how much hard drive space would a game (XBOX 1/360) take up? Also, with the standard 60GB how many 'retro' XBOX 1 games would i be able to copy/install and download from XBOX Live (if it is even possible) to the 360?      6. Does the standard 360 come with XBOX Live. i.e, will i have to pay anything to play online. I'm a bit sketchy with the XBOX Live details, I've heard you have to pay/subscribe...but the standard 360 comes with XBOX Live silver membership? Does this mean i dont have to pay?      7. What type of internet speed (minimum) would i need for online? I have ADSL 256/64...which i hate and will probly change to 1500/512.      Thats probably all for now x]. But yeah thanks!

20090307003319AAcoKtu	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Handbrake questions? IS IT the best for ipod?	I have sent up a board to determine wither or not I get an ipod or Zune. I am sure that I have made my mind up for ipod. BUT I need to know something. My main concern is framerate...what can I do for it to play perfectly without frame removal whatsoever? I noticed everytime I convert a dvd frames are missing (as my quicktime shows me) This is a main concern to me. The video plays alright on my computer. But it was most certainly noticeable on my nephews ipod chromic nano (I used Ipod legacy for highest quality when I put it on there. Should I have used basic?) So in short I don't know what to think of handbrake anymore or if I SHOULD have used basic over legacy on his ipod ( I converted the Dark Knight and found lots of frame skipping) please help. P.S. All dvds I rip are my own and payyed for so I'm not doing anything illegal. thank you
