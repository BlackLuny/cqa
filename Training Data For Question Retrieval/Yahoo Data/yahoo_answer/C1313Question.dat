There are two HUGE water mocassins living under there! I need to get rid of them by late summer when they reprodue, and they have around twenty kids. calling animal control wont help. I already did and they cant do anything because where i live they are protected. around now they start to lay across open branches of trees, where they will land on thier prey. Also, they stand their ground, and wont scurry off and will attack. What shpuld I do that wont put me in danger?! (they also chase my lawn guys.)

20081001072303AAOKzfR	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Should'nt our weight decrease during HIGH tide?	Now, if the moon is strong enough to pull water. When we weigh ourselves during HIGH tide we should be lighter.      Someone answered that this is true, but our machine isnt sensitive enough, plus our weight fluctuates alot with water loss and input. This is indeed very excellent logic. However I still dont agree.      As for the latter case, let's not take our weight as an example, but say a simple chemical preparation that I have to do in my lab. Say I have to weigh 30g of Na. If I weigh this during noon, then it is not a true 30g, but heavier actually. Isn't it?

20090130093935AAGxtrz	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Hippocrates "let your food be your medicine"?	Many great minds in history were vegetarian.     There is a connection between our digestive tracts and our mental well-being.  The connection lies in what some call the 'enteric' and the central nervous systems.   Stating our bodies have two nervous systems, both affected by our food.      Now, aside from our mental well-being, there are the cases of people who have become vegetarian after being diagnosed with lifelong diseases, and were able to reverse the condition and in many such cases, cure themselves, such as diabetes and cancer.      Not to mention most centenarians were and are vegetarians and usually only eat/ate natural foods.   Early communities who believed in such strict diets and work/exercise  were the Pythagorans, Essenes and Therapeutae to name a few, often reaching ages older than our modern super-centenarians.      Why, then, Doctors only receive about 10-12 hours of these nutritional courses, learning instead, to cover our symptoms, thus creating new ones?

Please give an example of this mechanism in real life. I think a perfect example is the human ability to call any number of things one.      My reasoning is simple:   (1) The extent of everything is infinite.   (2) The number of every thing within everything is infinite.   (3) So how much of everything would be prescribed to each thing if I were to equally divide everything among every thing.      I am a thing. How much of everything do I get?

I put my Ipod back on and changed to a different song.. when I did, the noises stopped, so I changed back to the first song. Then the noise was outside my bedroom window. So I changed the song again., and it stopped... so I chaned it back... and the noise didn't come back, but I was really tired, so I stopped the music, put it away, and closed my eyes. When I closed my eyes, I saw a man's face. It was blue though, kind of like outlined. It was amazingly clear and it scared me, so I opened my eyes and kinda gasped. Just as I did that I was slapped. It slapped me almost right across the nose, and it physcly turned my head when it happened... I laid there for a while very worried, but eventualy got to sleep..
