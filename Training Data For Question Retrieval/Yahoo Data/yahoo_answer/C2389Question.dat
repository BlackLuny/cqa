20090128152957AACc4Cy	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I am 33 years old will be turning 34 in March. Should I pursue my 2 year MBA or not ? Please help!!!?	Dear Sir,      I am 33 going to turn 34. I am a resident of India. My Date of birth is 1st March 1975. Time: 9.45 am Name: Vibhas Mehta. City & state of birth:Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Country: India Throughout my 6 years career, I am have not made any progress, only recently in the last 1 year, I have won awards and honor and increased my pay package at my current company. But I feel (as I have been trying for last 4 years but procrastinating) that I should move on and leave this country for good for pursuing the 2 year full time MBA with a decent university in USA which was always my dream and change my line from BPO collections industry to marketing, even though I am doing well now in the third party collections industry. If I stay here then there is a good chance in the next internal job opening to become a team leader, but the salary of a team leader (around 30,000 a month) will be half or even less of what I am earning at the basic collector level on an average after taxes, as the incentives are good at the basic level. Secondly, the growth after being a team leader is not fast. My hunch tells me it is slow after that to reach the next ladder will take some time. I earlier read in a horoscope that those born in 1975, their destiny lies in USA and wealth waits them. I don’t know how true this is. But my parents want me to get married and settle down here. The logic my father gives that I will spend two years pursuing my full time MBA and will not be earning, thus a loss of money, secondly after completing my MBA I will be age 36 or 37 and will be competing in the market with colleagues i.e. people younger to me around their 20s. I will be starting again at scratch.....I don’t know how long will it take me to get a promotion how fast will my career grow after the MBA ..And whether I will get a job there after my MBA Will it be worth investing 2 years of my youth? Will it benefit me in the long term or not ? I do not want to take a decision that I would regret later. But my father, since the last 3 years was ready to support me financially, since I can borrow a little bit from my sister who is working in Boston, USA currently for my MBA fees. The idea of going to USA to pursue my MBA came to me some years back when I was going nowhere with my career and I thought that maybe my luck will change if I change my environment and leave this country. But looking at the pros and cons, I am not sure what to do now. This confusion is killing me and I am depressed. I don’t know which decision will be beneficial for me in the future. Our family pundit on the other hand says that my luck will change for good as soon as I get married. In the meantime I have been searching for a partner who is willing to pursue her higher education with me in the States and then we get married and settle there. Seems impractical as per my father. Since I have been procrastinating taking steps to gain admission and give entrance exams for the MBA for the last couple of years my father is now advising me not to pursue MBA he believes that I cannot shake my laziness and do it, he feels that I am just using it as an excuse to while away time. Meanwhile I have started taking some concrete steps like contacting the universities in the States and asking questions related to admission. At the same time age is passing me by. I always wanted to do MBA from a good university abroad, but I guess I regret not doing it earlier when I was younger. I guess I am at a dead-end. I want to increase my earning power and I am a hard worker at office. The problem is that I am also very ambitious and materialistic unlike a typical Piscean. I want to catch up with my competitors and schoolmates some of whom might be at good positions at work. Right now I am in the last position in the race of life. Will I get a chance to overtake my fellow racers in this race of life? There are a few rounds left. Please guide me. My father tells me he will support me in my decisions, but he tells me he does not feel going abroad to pursue MBA is a good or practical decision, as I will loose two years of my life. If I pursue my MBA will I get married at age 37? In fact will I ever find the right partner? Or will it be too late. Please help. This is a question of life and death. I don’t want my career to go down the drain and one wrong decision will ruin my career and prospects of marriage. I’ve been thinking and thinking ...my mind keeps on going here and there like a see saw. At the same time it would have helped if I could have found a 1-year MBA course, which I have been unsuccessful to find. Please let me know what the stars indicate and which decision will be fruitful. What will the future be like? The basic question is will pursuing my MBA be beneficial or will I later regret loosing 2 years of my prime youth? Earlier some time back the idea was an ideal career launcher, but now I have to look at the ground realities. Please provide me some insight. I am stuck and if I don’t

20090128154804AARIkB8	Education & Reference;Special Education	Helping a parent come to terms with having a child with autism?	I'm working with a parent of kindergartner who I'd bet has autism.  The school secretary even stated it when they came to register over the summer.  He's receiving special education and speech (he carry on a basic conversation), but there's a lot more I could get for him with a diagnosis of autism from several different sources.  He's having major outbursts because of the lack of visual aids, etc. My small school only has 30 kids with disabilities and most are LD, of course.  Anyways, mom refuses to take him to a doctor, for even check-ups, because she doesn't want him diagnosed with autism.  (Yes!  She actually said that!!)  I don't know how to say or what to say to help move her past that.  I really do want what is best for her son and give him the kind of resources that will help him the most.  He's quickly going to force a move to a behavior class because of lack of cooperation.

20090128154021AAaIvgJ	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone EDIT this short paragraph?? easy 10 points!? EDIT!!?	Look at yourself. Are you skinny? Are you fat? Or are you in between? You see people all around you in all different sizes, but you notice the fat ones the most. Did you ever wonder what they've been eating? The answer lies right here in these schools. Everyday most of us here eat junk food at school. You're thinking, what? I'm just eating a little; there is nothing to be worried about. But don't get too cocky yet, the more you eat this stuff, the fatter you get. It can also lead to childhood obesity, and other problems caused by unhealthy eating such as heart disease, tooth decay, diabetes and more. Maybe you don't see it yet, but the people around you will. It's also a matter of self- confidence. Can somebody with these problems actually feel proud of themselves? People will take one look at you and find you disgusting. So don't do this to yourselves. Open Your Eyes! Say no to Junk food!   --------------------------------------...   Guys change the words if you want but make it sound better and if i have a grammar problem just fix it! Use big words it you want. Keep the questions so the reader gets thinking and doesn't get bored. Grade 8 students are the audiences!

I'm stuck in a rut between two colleges: South University and Savannah State University (HBCU-Historically black college/university). Savannah state's curriculum for a bachelor's degree in business seems wayyyy easier than South University. Basically why is that...I mean would it look better on me if I went to a school with more classes and a tougher curriculum and does it look like I copped out if I go to an HBCU which has a fairly easier curriculum? I just don't know what to do...any reasonable suggestions?   Thanks      BTW, what's the diff. between a bba and a ba at both schools they're considered bachelor's degrees!

20090128160821AA5JyOt	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Is taking 4 AP classes in senior year too much?	I am a junior now, so that'll make next year my senior year. I am taking APUSH, Health Services 5-6 (Medical class), Senior/Junior Literature, Physics, Pre-Calculus, Art, and Chemistry. And here's what I want to take next year:  AP Psychology  AP English  AP Calculus  AP Chemistry  Government and Economics  Spanish 3-4  Health Services 6-7    I am not sure if I should take all of them, the subjects that I am required to take are Health Services (because I want to major in the medical field), Government and Economics, and one English/Literature class. I don't have to take the rest, but I really love math and science, and AP English and AP Psychology sound sooo much fun! I don't have to take Spanish though but my last year's Spanish (1-2) teacher recommends me to take Spanish 3-4. What I am dreading is Government and Economics because it doesn't seem very interesting. I talked to a teacher and she said it's alright if I can manage my time, but my friends are all saying that it's too much, especially that it's going to be my senior year when I will have to write a lot of essays and letters for college applications and scholarships. Yet I want to take all of those classes though!  My plan is to preview AP Psych, AP Chem, AP Cal from now and throughout the summer and possibly ask the teacher for the list of the books we will read. Then if it's possible probably I will see what we'll learn in AP Cal. And I am going to study Spanish 3-4 beforehand and look through what we'll learn in Gov/Econ beforehand. Also, I think I will write application essays in the summer (some people recommended that because most of the essay topics are similar) and if I need to I'll change them in my senior year.     However, I am still not sure if I can handle all of those classes though. I know I will have to manage my time extremely well and do not procrastinate. I don't mind staying up late for homework unless it's 1 to 2+ in the morning. Although once in a while is fine.    So please give me suggestions, I really need those.  Thank you!    P.S. I am thinking of taking those classes anyway at the beginning of the school year and if they're not too much then I'll stay, if not then I'll drop out. I am hoping my schedule will work out and the school's next year's subjects schedule will work out for me...

I have a job now and I was looking to save some money before I started college and if I go to UF I won't be able to continue working.

20090128170336AAOM7kC	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I am really mad today.How do I deal with someone calling me dumb and that I dont deserve to be at a university?	Today, I just saw someone from my old high school. He was one of my classmate and my old best friend's friend. He introduce me to his roommate.Then he ask "why I was here?" and I was like "What do you mean.(i go here now)" He then call me "Dumb " and that he never expect I would be here. (his roommate was laughin) All I could do was punch him in the arm. But that upsetting me the whole day. I asked him some question to find out why he call me that. His gpa is 2.3ish and he doesnt work and he think he smarter than me (he blame his professor for his grades being low and sometimes he is too lazy to do hws) because he been going to the university longer than I have.       It really upset me because this is my first quarter at the UW. I used to go to the Community college and worked two jobs at time to support myself and I manage to get 2.88 overall and  got accept to the university because I worked hard at my jobs (nordstrom shoe salperson n student government as well as mentoring students)  and go to school fulltime despite having a learning disability. It frustrate me that he doesnt have a learning disability and doesn't even have to work hard and then have the nervous to call me dumb.       It makes me so piss off that all I want to do is excellence in school (especially now I dont work anymore,I am taking out student loan so I could do well to get into my major). This first quarter is so intense because of class loan and it takes me twice as long to understand the class and take the test.       I am trying to solve phys right now but all I could think is, why do I have a learning disability. But I am not going to give up because someone call me dumb.          I just want know why on earth would he be so rude to me??? He even have to ask me about my roommate and if she would hook up with him (he doesnt know her and she has a boyfriend, is he implying that I am ugly too).       It just doesnt make sense. Even my old best friend think she should be here and not me. I dont understand. I work hard and never give up to be here, only be hated on because I am at my dream school.

20090128171543AANqXCt	Education & Reference;Homework Help	How does my essay sound, and what corrections need to be made?	The Steinway Grand Piano is the most prestigious piano on today’s market. They cost from the upwards of $52,000 for the US built version of the piano and twice that amount for the Hamburg built version. These pianos are owned by the extremely wealthy and/or fantastic pianists. Steinway Grand’s are used in the top music conservatories and universities in the world. No other piano’s quality can surpass that of a Steinway. The process of making a Steinway has not changed much since it was founded in 1853 by Henry E. Steinway.       The making of a Steinway is a one year process. The first step of making a Steinway is selecting a matured maple tree from Steinways personal “Piano case maple forest.” Once the maple has been selected, it is soaked and steamed for two weeks. During this time, the wood expands and becomes slightly pliable. After the steaming process, the wood is taken out and formed around a steel casing of a piano. It takes twelve to fourteen full grown men to bend the maple around the form and use bolts and straps to secure it to the form. After three days of air drying in the factory. It is brought outside (summer only) and allowed to expand and shrink around the mold for one week.       After the wood has taken the shape of the mold, it is released and put in a room with two hundred other grand piano cases. Each case stays in the temperature controlled room for two months. If you take the case out too late or too early the piano will not have Steinway quality and is rejected. This happens only about once every three years. During the two months of curing, the action is made. The action is the part of the piano that the keys are attached to. When you press a key, the action moves a hammer, which in turn, strikes a string. The making of an action is a delicate process. The action contains 8,800 moving pieces (100 pieces per key). Very few people are qualified to make a Steinway action. Also, during the time the action is being made, and the case is being cured, the bridge, soundboard, and veneers (only for pianos with wood grain finish) are being made.                 The process of bridge making is well kept secret. Only 3 men in the US make bridges for Steinway. These men are special craftsmen; they are able to create a bridge that will fit perfectly inside the piano without measurements. The bridge is attached to the soundboard. The sound board is the “heart of a Steinway piano.” The soundboard is made of specially selected spruce. The spruce it cut into strips that are 6 inches wide and they are beveled and put together. Once the soundboard has been put together, it gets ribs and is shaped; then the bridges are attached. Once all of the piano pieces are made and painted they are put together.       To assemble a Steinway, you first attach legs to the case. Then you lower and attach the soundboard to the case. Then you slide the action in, lower in an iron casting and bolt it into the case. Once an inspection has been made and passes ALL of the tests, the piano is strung and tuned. When the piano is tuned properly, the stings exert a force of 10,000 lbs on the piano. The iron casing keeps the piano from collapsing. After the assembly process has been completed, the piano is shipped out to various dealers, schools, recital halls, and Steinways one and only “Steinway Hall” in New York City.       The Steinway piano is the best piano money can buy. Steinway’s goal is to “Build the best piano possible, [and] sell it at the lowest price consistent with quality.” For over a century and a half, the world’s most accomplished pianists have preferred to express the musical talents on a Steinway & Sons piano. Though many people believe that owning a Steinway & Sons piano is exclusive to the virtuosi, it is in-fact “a world open to all who share a love of music, fine craftsmanship and enduring quality.”            Please let me know what you think and what corrections need to be made. thank you!

"Quotations introduced by ‘that’ are indirect discourse and are not enclosed in quotation marks."      Could anyone explain what those two mean? And also, what is an "attributive phrase?"

20090128170039AA0yfZF	Education & Reference;Teaching	How to deal with sons teacher?	My son is in the 4th grade and he's B/C student. This year his teacher is constantly telling me that he is not trying hard enough and his grades are slipping.  But the truth is he has never tried harder. She gives about 2 hours of homework, expects him to read for at least half an hour, then write for another half and hour and then she wants him to repeat his multiplication facts every night. We have no time for anything else.  I have enrolled him in Kumon and we have been doing everything she suggested, but it's still not enough. He gets no positive reinforcement whatsoever from her.  I see the improvement but for some reason she doesn't.  He tries really hard and all this negativity is very discouraging to him.  What should i do in this situation?

20090128164211AA8WWze	Education & Reference;Teaching	Teacher sent my daughter down to the office?	My thirteen-year-old daughter got sent down to the office by her supply teacher today – she says it was because she didn’t want to play ball in gym and wanted to study some more for her math test instead. She says the supply teacher was rude to her and started yelling and saying, “Do you think you’re special?” and getting really upset (which I do believe since she and my son have had many difficulties with this particular supply teacher – my son, who has special needs, gets sent down to the office every single time this teacher subs for his class, and from what I’ve seen and heard, this supply teacher has anger issues and should not be a teacher). And my daughter told this supply teacher she didn’t like the way he was talking to her, and he said, “Are you deaf? I told you to play!” She shrugged and went back to her work and he sent her down to the office.      My daughter talked to the principal about this, and as my daughter is a good student and rarely gets into trouble, the principal believed her and told her she’d talk to this supply teacher and it isn’t right for him to talk to her that way and said that my daughter could stay in the vice-principal’s office and do her math if she wanted, which my daughter did. But what should I do about this? Should I punish my daughter for being rude to a teacher, even if it was just a little? What should I do, if anything, about this supply teacher?

Like a lesson, stratagy, activity or something like that. I'm in her class during two of her classes, and they can get pretty noisy, so they cant really handle group work.

I've already paid $2000 (private school) out of pocket for it, even though it shows a pending financial aid.  Because the class is only 3 units, I know the financial aid won't get completed.        I'm attending another school, taking post-bacc courses for med school.  I wanted to take Spanish but it conflicts with my work schedule.  I figured maybe I could take it at the school I'm graduating from, that way I can transfer it over and have the time to take it.  This would also make me eligible to take the financial aid that's still pending.  Only thing is, they're now telling me, because the Spanish course doesn't apply to my degree, I would have to pay for it out of pocket and financial aid still wouldn't cover the applied degree course I already paid for.      They told me to talk to financial aid tomorrow to see if they'll let my financial aid go through for the classes. Should I bother explaining why I intended to take the Spanish class?

20090128181424AAgCN1E	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I need advice on my roommate dilemna?	So, I literally went from having no one to dorm with in college to two people both thinking i am living with them in just a day!  The first is my closest friend and another girl in our 'group.'  They plan on living away from our campus meaning i would have to depend on a shuttle to take me to public transit to take me to class.  I'm weary if the shuttle didn't run I would miss class because parking is impossible.  When I went on vacation with her last year she drove me crazy though, and I don't want to ruin our friendship.  The complex is top notch, furnished, and includes a lot of extras that I probably wouldn't use (tanning bed, pool table, etc.)      My second possibility is with someone i am close friends with and the location is pretty convenient.  She is set on this building and since there are only a few vacancies we must act fast.  The price is actually pretty good and I'm going to see it tomorrow.  It looks nice but is unfurnished and I have never spent the night with her before...      I'm really leaning towards the second one, but am just lost inside.  How do I tell my closest friend that I am not going to live with her.  I feel very bad because without me, she and the other girl may not be able to afford two bedroom places.  I want to remain close to her throughout college because I feel like she is one of my lifelong friends and I just don't know which to pick and what to say to each.

20090128181936AAjbIig	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Can't Seem to grip HS Spanish- help!?	I am a High School student in 11th grade taking Spanish II (In New York City if it matters). I have been struggling with Spanish since middle school, but I have never failed the class (passed with a C/C-).       This year, however, I have a very strict teacher who doesn't seem to want to deal with my struggles. I've failed every quiz and test and her class and I'm honestly just overwhelmed to the point of a nervous breakdown. Every time I go to her for help, she seems to get annoyed. She teaches in Spanish and I honestly don't understand what is going on half the time. I'm a very intelligent person, and outside of this class I am doing relatively good in school (passing all my other classes).      What should I do? This has been causing me high levels of anxiety for months, and she seems very combative about helping me... Won't sit down with me to explain things, won't give me extra review, she says she sees absolutely no effort so she has no will to help me at all. But I am trying!      She has her own style of teaching and she gives us her own vocab in each unit. She refuses to give out study guides or textbooks.      I want to get a grip on this subject and at least pass. What can I do?

20090128182812AA3UPbm	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I want to go to boarding school. How do I talk to my mother about it?	I live in a town with two high schools, both of which are unable to accommodate my academic needs. I've taken higher-level classes, tried different teachers, and researched schools in the area, but my best bet is a high school that has fantastic academic program, but 20 students in it. After much struggle, I've decided I can't stay here, but I don't want to go to a school with 20 students in it.      I've been looking at my options and have briefly gone over them with my mother. The first time I brought boarding school up, it was an immediate no- "That's where parents dump their kids off!" "I need to raise you" etc. Over time, I've mentioned it again to be met with a shrug, so I've begun research and am finding places I'm really interested in.      However, I have yet to talk to my mother about it. In the past, we have moved toward change, but she always loses momentum and decides the way things are is better; she doesn't like change, or the idea of her kids leaving her. It doesn't help that I'm the oldest and she has yet to experience the "going away to college" thing, though all three of us kids leave for the summer (divorced parents) and she survives.      SO! I need to find a way to bring this up with my mother where she won't feel immediately threatened. I don't know if I should do my research first and present things positively- "Merit scholarships, independence, I can use my laptop and cell phone"- or present the idea gently, again positively, and then do the research with her. Any thoughts from mothers, boarders, or other out there?
