If theres a better way than TextIO to read and write (I think there is, I just haven't learned it yet) please tell me. However, the main thing I'm trying to accomplish is writing to (and later reading from) file via an applet.   If I left something out or there needs to be any clarification please say so.

I know it sounds gross, but it's true. =(    First of all, I don't eat at my laptop. It's actually really clean. Today I opened the bottom to look inside and ants were crawling out everywhere! They also laid (what I think) white eggs all over, it was disgusting. Most were found in the area with the air vents. I ended up blow-drying, wiping with peroxide (only thing I had), and tapping around to get them to come out. Are ants attracted to electricity or something?     I know how to get rid of them (very tedious too), but how do I prevent it from happening again? They are becoming quite a problem and may soon cause problems for my hard drive.     Thanks for reading

20071217155216AAg9R9a	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Lista de palabras en espa?ol!!!?	Tuve que programar un corrector ortografico para un cliente y quedo bastante bien salvo por un detalle. Mi lista de palabras del diccionario esta un poco incompleta y por ende marca como errores ortográficos palabras que estan bien escritas!!!      Tengo tres opciones:       1 - Escribir un programa que se alimente de libros digitales (lo cual no es fiable porque muchas veces un libro contiene errores ortograficos o palabras inventadas por el autor) y despues corregir a mano los cientos de errores que encuentre... =S      2 - Meter a mano todas las palabras del diccionario y pasar navidad digitando ='(      3 - Que alguno de mis amigos en Yahoo respuestas me diga si por casualidad conocen de un recurso o lista en internet que contenga todas las palabras del espa?ol (o por lo menos las mas usadas) =D      De momento estoy tratando de entrar en la base de datos del sitio web de la RAE. Pero por si fracaso en mis intentos quisiera ir ganando algo de tiempo...      GRACIAS A TODOS DE ANTEMANO!!!

Hi,    Could someone please solve the problem i'm having for the past 3DAYS!!!    Here's the scenario:    My hard drive gone dead about a week ago (Seagate ATA IV 80G).    So i went and bought a NEW hard drive (WD SATA II 640G). I connected all the cables correctly (using power cable converter for connecting the power for the hard drive, and data cable connected to the mother board)    Note: the BIOS/DOS does not detect my SATA HD when i boot up my comp.    Then i tried to install Windows Vista.... following the prompt....    and till the stage when you partition your drives, it shows that it detects the drive and i can also partition the drives, but it says it requires a software/driver?!?!    And so i went to WD official website and downloaded "Data Lifeguard Tools 11.2 for DOS" and also "Data Lifeguard Diagnostic for DOS".... thought this would work (i.e. would include drivers for WD hard drives)    Sorry if i sound like a computer n00b..... but are those files the right ones which i needed? Or can someone provide me with a link with the correct driver i need!    Also please let me know how can i make my computer detect my new SATA HD.    If anyone can help me out with this that would be FANTASTIC!!!    Thanks in advance!

To resolve this:          If you have firewall or security software installed please ensure RuneScape/Java is allowed to open outgoing network connections on ports 43594.          Note Windows XP Service Pack 2 has built in firewall software. If when loading RuneScape this asks if you want to allow the connection, you need to say 'yes'.          If that doesn't help then an external firewall may be causing the problem. Please ask your network adminstrator/ISP to open port 43594 for TCP traffic.             I did everything they told me to do installed everything and even firefox but I dont seem to be able to load it   XP (( security is disable )

Basically, we have 2 buttons -   1 :- This sends the information back to the same script - re-showing   the same information   2 :- This button sends the information to the part to store / add to a   MYSQL database....

I'm usually a web designer but have done this sort of thing before.   I've been asked to make an a4 flyer which will be printed both sides. I understand that I will need to make 2 300dpi A4 documents at 210x297... is there anything else anyone can empart? Best colour modes, good practises to make printers lives easier? I need it to be right the first time it goes to the printers so if I'm prepared I feel I'll be ok!       Cheers

20090129011345AARqmWw	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	PHP: Putting dynamic values into an array?	I have a script that calls array(A,B,C,D) where the values A through D can be anything. I prefer to have them inserted dynamically, not hardcoded, using the GET method.      The problem is that when I do call array($_GET[x]), it only pulls the first value for x. So, if the querystring is x=A,B,C,D, only A is being displayed. It's not displaying B,C, or D. I need all of these to display.       So, to sum it all up, I need    A,B,C,D    to be inserted into array()   so that it will look like this   array(A,B,C,D)         Thanks.

20090129011116AAO6lhM	Computers & Internet;Software	Can anybody help with an excel macro/excel fill down query?	I recently posted a question regarding why I could not use the fill down function on excel whilst autofilter is on. I have discovered that one of the problems is because I import data from access into excel as if I do this when I import data from excel to excel it works fine. I tried instead recording a macro whereby instead of using filldown i simply dragged the cell down. I am dragging text/numbers and also formulas down. When I run the macro it runs fine filling in the first cell but does not replicate the dragdown of the cell. I need to do this as each time I refresh excel and it imports the data from access it wipes all the previous days work and I have to start again. Does anyone know why this happens? I hope this makes sense. Thanks in advance.

Hi,      I have a website and it looks fine in internet explorer browser, but in Firefox there are a few things (like the spacing of the headlines and font sizes) that are distorted.       1. Do you know why this happens?       2. And is there a website or something that makes your website compatible (free hopefully) with all the main browsers? My main concern is Firefox...      I would appreciate all help!      Thanks so much!!!
20070526060146AADXYPz	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Can anyone explain the below to me ?...its about Java programming...?	Normally, arguments passed into a function are passed by value, which means that a copy of the passed value is given to the function. When you change the value of the argument in the function, you are changing the copy, while the original value stays the same. However, some arguments are passed by reference, which means that the original object is passed to the function. In this case, changing the argument's value in the function changes the original value, too.

I install the software like they say in the installation guide, but half way they ask me to activate my copy of Kaspersky Int. Sec. online, by using the activation code on the reverse side of the CD envelope. Like they said, i did everything, i wrote the right code and clik next. But suddenly a small window showed up and tell me that the activation was unable to connect to the server. I did not understand because my  internet connection was ON, and i could go on the net as much as i wanted.   So, is the code that they gave me WRONG? Or is there something that i missed? Or is the code already USED? Please answer me, i really need help. Thank you.      (By the way, i can not also access to the Kaspersky official web site for help, is there any reason too?)

Everything on my Ubuntu system seems to work great...  except when I run aMule for a long period of time (many hours), the video performance goes to heck.      Top shows there's enough memory, nothing is eating up CPU time, no zombie processes, and everything that DOESN'T require a graphical interface is responsive and acting as it should.      I can play audio without any difficulty, but I can't so much as scroll through a list of files without a perturbing delay.  Playing video is totally out of the question.      Reboot and it works fine again.      I'm not over-using aMule (a dozen or two downloads and upload capped at 10kbps)...  what should I be looking at to troubleshoot this?      Thanks!
