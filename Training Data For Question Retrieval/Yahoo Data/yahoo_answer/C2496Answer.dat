F4wao6ZHaa	I would go have them professionally fitted it may be worth- if you live in england to go to the 'move it' exhibitions as lots of pointe shows will be there with discounts and professional fitting and advice if not definitely go for gel it is so much more comfortable than sponge this can normally be bought with the shoes. so go to your local dance shop explain what sort of pointe you do and they will get the best shoes for that. the sizing thing is where they measure all different parts of your foot and 'mould' the shoe to that shape so it fits securely and supports your ankle. hope this helps :) x|`|Ddfff5psaa	OK well first of all there are 3 different shanks, i suggest medium since you just starting... There are different sizes of point too ask the dance store to further explain it to you.  The sizing ranges depending on the brand of point shoe, but you need to be able to pinch 1 inch off the back of the slipper when you are on point( room for inserts.) For example i usually wear a 7 in street shoe, my point shoes ( which are Capezio brand) are a size 9. You should buy gel inserts to cushion your foot, but there are a million different options.  Everything from toe cushions to full sized ones.  I tape my toes, some girls don't.  I feel i need to.    However I suggest you get some kind of tutorial since you can really hurt your Archilles tendon and knees with just your own instruction.

PmiZUblCaa	Try and go for a used one first. Then once you get really good and get used to drumming, go for the new. <br>  <br>  Reason for used first is because you can bang the living crap out of them, and not waist money. Drums do have a tendency to break if your not carefull. Plus it'll help you take care of the newer set, because you'll know exactly what your doing with them.<br>  <br>  As for leaving the kit in the garage, it's ok. Just make sure to cover them up with a large blanket to keep the moister of the cymballs. Moisture and metal don't mix. The blanket can keep them from getting moisture on them and make the kit last longer.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the lessons :D <br>  <br>  AA|`|IGcS9K62aa	Get a used one. You'll probably be able to get decent quality for a lot cheaper (and you can just replace the heads as needed, way cheaper!). Then once you know whether or not you're going to stick with it you can invest in a better one. By then you will probably have opinions on which makers/pieces you like the best. Then you'll be able to get exactly what you want--and not be stuck with a start model just because you had to buy new right out the gate.

Arthur Miller was writing about his own involvement in tribunals to where he was accused of being a Communist.  The only way out of this was by confessing your guilt and/or to give up the names of other associates, testifying that they had communist involvement themselves.  If you look at the play in that context, then you will see that he denounces these acts as society fueling the fire through panic and without any hard evidence that any of these people are communists (or witches)
AA11803994	Hi - I have always been into art but my parents always encourage me to do something artistic that paid. I love doing paintings and watercolors and printing, etc. I ended up getting a degree in Graphic Design. It was computer based but I could bring my own handmade art into it by scanning in pieces that I painted or illustrated and then work with it on the computer. Depending on your location, Graphic Designers can make very good money. You won't ever struggle with money in this field since everything is so computer based now and everyone needs help promoting their business.<br>  In Graphic Design you can create logos for companies and direct mail pieces, advertisements....the opportunities are quite endless. You can work in Hollywood on CD campaigns for singers or you can work on billboard ads for non-profits companies. I suggest doing some research online.<br>  I would check out jobsites and type in graphics, art, illustration, etc.(whatever kind of art you like to do) in the keyword search and see what it comes up with. That way you can see what kind of artistic jobs are out there and most likely the job description will have a salary posted with it.<br>  <br>  It's very smart of you to start thinking about this now BEFORE you go to college! :) Good luck!!|`|K4rP4A0naa	Depends what sort of art you like. If you're into illustration you can do animation or graphic design, video game or movie art. There's lots of money in all of those.<br>  <br>  If you're into painting or sculpture you can also work in those industries but there's probably fewer positions and most painters and sculptors aspire to make enough money to be a practicing artist. It's a struggle for most but if it's what you love, go for it. This would involve creating canvases etc. and exhibiting. If you can make a name for yourself, big corporations and collectors will commission your work. <br>  <br>  You can make the most money like this but only a small percentage of artists do make it big.

7Srd7Pliaa	If you have light you will have shadow, but there are a few things you can do to make the shadow less noticeable.  The quality of light refers to how sharp your shadows are going to be.  Smaller lights that are further away will make very sharp, crisp shadows that are very noticeable.  Larger lights that are close by will make fuzzy, less distinct shadows.<br>  <br>  You can make a small light "bigger" (for the camera's purposes) by using some sort of diffusion.  For example, window sheers that let light in but provide privacy will diffuse the light from outside--making the light inside more desirable.  If you place one of those between your light source and the subject the shadows will be less noticeable.<br>  <br>  You can also place the light above the subject which provides a small shadow below them.  It doesn't work too well with people because if the light is too contrasty the people will look like they have raccoon eyes.<br>  <br>  The best way to think about it is this: the shadows will always be opposite of the light.  If the light is in front of your subject, the shadow will be behind them.  If the light is behind your subject, the shadow will be in front of them.  If you are using a flash, the light will be very hard (crisp shadows) and it will always be behind the subject.  That's because a Kodak point and shoot can't move its flash away from the camera.  It's also why you tend to get red-eye with it.|`|JBTYfyleaa	its all about lighting if the light is on the object there is going to be a shadow behind it.. u cant get rid of the shadow unless its dark or maybe the light is right over the object.|`|K4rP4A0naa	I take it you are shooting still life? If you are, all you need is lights placed in the right spots to wash out the shadows. You can use cheap desk lamps for this but will obviously get better results with pro equipment.<br>  <br>  You can apply the same technique outdoors by placing your subject in front of the sun but then you may need flash. You can also use reflective boards to do the same thing as the lamps do indoors. You could make one cheap by sticking foil over card.|`|3r9bgYuSaa	Microsoft digital image software removes red eye, blemishes, adds light, you can remove things from pictures.

That first evening they celebrated at the camp, staying up all night, and at some stage during the evening the fossil AL 288-1 was nicknamed Lucy, after the Beatles song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", which was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp."

AA11101806	ask someone else to do your homework.<br>  <br>  if you have to cheat, use Yahoo or Google.
7Srd7Pliaa	I highly recommend the book "Understanding Exposure" by Peterson to help understand the creative effects and trade-offs of which aperture and shutter speed you want to use.  Most of the time landscapes don't change, and the detail you capture is the most important aspect.  Since landscape photographers prefer the sun to be low in the sky (morning and evening hours) to provide a nice favorable light, it is also less intense.  These factors are why landscape photographers tend to use longer exposures to compensate for the other aspects.  You can capture more detail with less grain (or digital noise if you use digital cameras) if you use a low ISO.<br>  <br>  Add to that the fact that you can get some really cool results with wind blowing through a field of grain or water flowing through a brook when you have longer exposures, it only bolsters that preference more.  It really has less to do with preferring long shutter speeds as it is preferring smaller apertures and low ISO film/capture.  BTW, film photographers can use ISO 25 film that rivals the most advanced digital sensors, of course that is only if you shoot black and white.|`|k8AcVixTaa	Not if you were using the proper f stop to match the shutter speed.  For my landscapes I generally shoot at F64 at 1/2 second shutter.  I use Ilford Delta Pro film which is rated at ISO 100.  I generally rate mine at ISO 200 and then develop 30 seconds to a minute longer.  I also use the Zone System for exposure and development.|`|AA12185092	Landscape photographers tend to use small apertures to maximize depth of field, and slow films to get sharp detail and fine grain, thus necessitating slow shutter speeds. If you need a longer exposure in order to capture motion blur, you can use neutral density filters.|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	Not if you used the right aperture size. What determines whether or not an imagine is exposed correctly isn't just the shutter speed, but a combination of shutter speed, aperture size, and film speed. A long shutter speed used with an appropriately small aperture would result in the same correct exposure that a short film speed coupled with a large aperture size would.<br>  <br>  Landscape photographers use long shutter speeds because it allows them to use very small apertures, which gives their images lots of depth of field. They also use wide angle lenses because these lenses also give great depth of field.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	There are different reasons for using different shutter speeds.<br>  <br>  If you're taking a picture of a stationary scene, depending on how much depth of field you need, you will need to adjust to a higher number in your aperture (less light in) which will require a slower shutter speed.<br>  <br>  If you are photographing a waterfall or water, and you are interested in the "misty" water, you will need to photograph at a slower shutter speed to capture more movement in the water.  To do this, you use what's called "neutral density" filters.  This has a sunglasses type of effect on the photo in the sense that it restricts the amount of light getting in.  In this case, exposures can be much longer and not run the risk of overexposure.|`|a25d33c1f7915100af903f928df66e3caa	it really depends on the aperature that your using for the landscape. you want to use a very small aperature for landscape to get rid of the depth of field. so at f/22 or even, if you can, f/32, the shutter will be really slow. if you are near water/river/etc... the long shutter will make the water really interesting too... good luck|`|P7Ae8j2Xaa	It depends on your picture, if it's a picture of the night, then yes, you need a long shutter. If you want to give it a try during the day though, i would recommend using a higher f-stop (smaller apperture of the iris)

ceBTTCPwaa	In Cold Blood is a 1966 book by Truman Capote, an American author.<br>  <br>  The book details the 1959 slaying of Herbert Clutter, a wealthy farmer from Holcomb, Kansas; his wife, and two children. When Capote learned of the quadruple murder before the killers were captured, he decided to travel to Kansas and write about the crime. Bringing his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee along, together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes. The killers, Richard "Dick" Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested not long after the murders, and Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book. It is considered the originator of the non-fiction novel and the forerunner of the New Journalism movement.<br>  <br>  The plot weaves a complicated psychological story of two parolees who together commit a mass murder, an act they were not capable of individually. Capote's book also details the lives of the victims and the effect the crime had on the community where they lived.

shVgCizBaa	Fall of Constantinople Date April 2, 1453 – May 29, 1453 <br>  present-day Istanbul <br>     The Fall of Constantinople was a siege in which the Ottoman Empire under the command of Sultan Mehmed II attempted to capture the capital of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople which was defended by the army of Emperor Constantine XI. The siege lasted from Thursday, 5 April 1453 until Tuesday, 29 May 1453, according to the (Julian Calendar), when the city fell to the Ottomans. The event marked the end of the political independence of the millennium-old Byzantine Empire, which was by then already fragmented into several Greek monarchies.<br>  <br>  Following his accession to the Ottoman throne in 1451, Mehmed had been applying pressure on Constantinople and the Byzantines by building forts along the Dardanelles. On 5 April, he laid siege to Constantinople with an army numbering 80,000 to 200,000 men. The city was defended by an army of 7,000 of whom 2,000 were foreigners. The siege began with heavy Ottoman artilery firing at the city's walls while a smaller Ottoman force captured the rest of the Byzantine strongholds in the area. Ottoman attempts to blockade the city completely failed at first owing to the boom blocking the entrance to the Golden Horn thus allowing four Christian ships to enter the city. Mehmed had his ships rolled into the Golden Horn on greased logs and a Byzantine effort to destroy the ships with fire ships failed, allowing the Ottomans to seal the city off.<br>  <br>  The Turkish frontal assaults on the walls were all repulsed with heavy casaulities and the Turkish attempts to undermine the walls were all countered and abandoned. Mehmed's offer to lift the siege, if he was given the city, was rejected. On 22 May, the moon rose in eclipse prophesying the fall of the city and a few days later Constantine received news that no Venetian relief fleet was coming. After midnight of the 29, the Ottoman army attacked the walls. The first wave of irregulars was thrown back. The second Turkish wave of Anatolians managed to breach the Blachernae section of walls. The defenders pushed back the Anatolians and managed to hold out against the Sultan's elite Janissaries. During the fighting, the Genoese commander, Giovanni Giustiniani was fatally wounded and retreated to his ships with his men. The Emperor and his men continued to hold off the Turks until the Turks discovered an unlocked gate upon which they flooded into the city. Constantine reportedly fell leading a charge against the invaders, though his body was never found. The last defenders were subdued and the Turks proceeded to loot the city.<br>  <br>  This battle marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, an empire which had lasted for over 1,100 years. The city's fall was a massive blow for Christendom. Pope Nicholas V ordered an immediate counter-attack, but his death soon after marked the end of the plan. Mehmed made Constantinople his capital and proceeded to conquer the last two Byzantine states, the Despotate of Morea and the Empire of Trebizond in 1460 and 1461 respectively. Many Greeks fled the city and migrated to other parts of Europe, in particular Italy. This move is thought to have helped fuel the Renaissance. The Fall of Constantinople is seen by some scholars as being a key event in leading to the end of the Middle Ages.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Con...</a>|`|4ilM2hCwaa	Here are some sources for you to work with:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://middleeasternhistory.suite101.com/article.cfm/the_fall_of_constantinople_1453" rel="nofollow">http://middleeasternhistory.suite101.com...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Medieval/war/FallOfConstantinople.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Medieval/w...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displaystory.cfm?story_id=346800" rel="nofollow">http://www.economist.com/diversions/mill...</a>|`|MHphepQPaa	Rio de Janeiro, Brasil.<br>  <br>  A queda de Constantinopla foi a conquista da capital bizantina pelo Império Otomano sob o comando do sult?o Maomé II, na ter?a-feira, 29 de maio de 1453. Isto marcou n?o apenas a destrui??o final do Império Romano do Oriente, e a morte de Constantino XI, o último imperador bizantino, mas também a estratégica conquista crucial para o domínio otomano sobre o Mediterraneo oriental e os Bálc?s. A cidade de Constantinopla permaneceu capital do Império Otomano até a dissolu??o do império em 1922, e foi oficialmente renomeada Istanbul pela República da Turquia em 1930.<br>  <br>  A queda de Constantinopla para os turcos otomanos foi um evento histórico que segundo alguns historiadores marcou o fim da Idade Média na Europa, e também decretou o fim do último vestígio do Império Bizantino.<br>  <br>  Constantinopla (em latim: Constantinopolis; em grego: Κωνσταντινο?πολη) é o antigo nome da cidade de Istambul, na atual Turquia. O nome original era Bizancio (do grego Bυζαντιον, transliterado em Bizancio). O nome da cidade era uma referência ao imperador romano Constantino I, que tornou esta cidade a capital do Império Romano em 11 de Maio de 330.<br>  Constantinopla era, até o momento de sua queda, uma das cidades mais importantes no mundo. Localizada numa proje??o de terra sobre o estreito de Bósforo em dire??o à Anatólia, funcionava como uma ponte para as rotas comerciais que ligavam a Europa à ásia por terra. Também era o principal porto nas rotas que iam e vinham entre o Mar Negro e o Mar Mediterraneo. Para explicar como uma cidade deste porte caiu em m?os estrangeiras, é preciso voltar a séculos antes de 1453 e detalhar os eventos que enfraqueceram o Império Bizantino.<br>  <br>  A partir do século III, o centro administrativo do Império Romano tendia a voltar-se mais para o Oriente, por múltiplas raz?es. Primeiro pela necessidade de defesa das fronteiras orientais; depois porque o oriente havia se tornado a parte econ?mica mais vital do domínio romano; por fim Roma era uma cidade rica de vestígios pag?os, o que agora era inconveniente num império crist?o: seus edifícios, sua nobreza senatorial, apegada à religi?o tradicional. Assim Constantino decretou a constru??o de uma nova capital, nas margens do Bósforo, onde havia a antiga fortaleza grega de Bizancio, num ponto de grande importancia estratégica, nas proximidades de dois importantes setores da limes: a regi?o do baixo Danúbio e a fronteira do Império Sassanida. A nova cidade, que recebeu o nome de Constantinopla, isto é, "cidade de Constantino", foi concebida como uma "nova Roma" e rapidamente tornou-se o centro político e econ?mico do Império. Sua cria??o teve repercuss?es também no plano eclesiástico: enquanto em Roma a Igreja Católica adquiriu mais autoridade, em Constantinopla o poder civil controlou a Igreja. O bispo de Roma p?de assim consolidar a influência que já possuía, enquanto em Constantinopla o bispo baseava seu poder no fato de ser bispo da capital e no fato de ser um homem de confian?a do Imperador.[9]<br>  <br>  Durante a Quarta Cruzada em 1204, foi capturada e saqueada e depois recapturada pelas for?as de Niceia, sob o comando de Miguel VIII Paleólogo em 1261. Come?ava a decadência que quase dois séculos depois levaria ao fim definitivo do império.<br>  <br>  O declínio do Império Bizantino decorre principalmente da expans?o dos turcos seljúcidas e dos conflitos com os húngaros. Porém, a primeira vez que Constantinopla foi saqueada o foi pelos crist?os ocidentais, e n?o por seus inimigos tradicionais. A capital do Império Romano do Oriente foi tomada pela Quarta Cruzada em 1204. O ataque foi feito pelo mar, e a cidade foi saqueada e incendiada por três dias, e nem tesouros da Igreja Ortodoxa e supostas relíquias crist?s, riquezas acumuladas por quase 1000 anos, foram poupados.<br>  <br>  As raz?es da tomada de Constantinopla s?o variadas e complexas. Em 1190, a Terceira Cruzada, formada por contingentes das potências ocidentais, n?o recebeu dos bizantinos o apoio esperado quando se dirigia à Terra Santa, o que levou a um forte ressentimento. Tal fato se deu porque os bizantinos, acreditando que o líder dos turcos, Saladino (principal inimigo dos cruzados instalados na Terra Santa), fosse invencível, preferiram manter a maior neutralidade possível a fim de evitar um futuro ataque aos seus territórios. Outro fator a ser levado em conta é o cisma religioso existente, o qual n?o foi aplacado pelos esfor?os da Igreja Católica Romana (latina) e da Igreja Católica Ortodoxa (grega). Também deve ser considerado o costume de se distribuir entre os generais e seus soldados o butim de guerra, neste caso formado pelos lendários tesouros e famosas relíquias. Por outro lado, os venezianos exigiam um pre?o pela sua participa??o nas cruzadas, e os cruzados viram na capital bizantina a única fonte de recursos disponível para satisfazer os venezianos.<br>  <br>  Além disso, existia um crise sucessória no trono bizantino, que facilitou a investida cruzada. Depois de uma revolta bizantina, em
KADDz1EPaa	In the middle ages torture was practiced<br>  <br>  By a i|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Hope you have a strong stomach. . .<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjYFaJPju8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjYFaJPj...</a>|`|ZBV5TET7aa	The Rack, also known as the Duke of Exeter's daughter, is the most common torture device known, whereby those who are subjected to it have their arms and legs bound and stretched. They could be stretched to the point of joints separating if they don't talk. Other devices include the Scavenger's Daughter, the Captain's Daughter(Cat O Nine tails), and the Gunner's Daughter. Of course, there is the Iron Maiden, a human-shaped coffin with spikes inside.|`|vOay8F4Yaa	I could put a list on here if you'd like, I'll explain each one for you;<br>  <br>  -The Rack, This is probably the most famous one. It's a wooden frame, with a handle, rolls and spikes randomly attached. Arms and legs would be chained to the top and bottom, And the torturer would pull the handle once in a specific time. Limbs would eventually be torn off.<br>  <br>  -Boiling, The name says enough I think, A large cauldron was filled with water, oil or any liquid that could be made extremely hot (boiling) And the tortures would put the victim in.<br>  <br>  -Rats, The most cheap and effective way. A few variants are known, But the most seen one was the one when rats were forced into the body (the intestines) The victim lies fully restrained on the ground, the rat or rats are placed on the stomach covered by a metallic container (or any other material, But the rats shouldn't be able to escape) Tortureres would heat this container and the rats would naturally start to panic and look for a way out. Good guess. Through the victim's body.<br>  <br>  -Live Burial, this method consists of exposing the victim to nature's elements. <br>  <br>  -Judas Cradle, The Judas Chair is a pyramid-shaped seat. The victim was placed on top of it, with the point inserted into their anus, vagina or scrotum, then very slowly lowered by ropes. Some theories suggest that this was meant to slowly impale the victim.<br>  <br>  Hopefully I've helped you with this.

We're not contributing to anything larger, it's just a bunch of people on a planet trying to get along for awhile. It's just more fun having life around than having absolutely nothing.|`|TyJuZnZhaa	There isn't really a purpose. There is just things that are suggested for you to do. Or sometimes, forced.<br>  <br>  <br>  Humanity is like a set of blocks to a pyramid, the younger ones are formed in hopes to support the older ones.|`|uxExLJUMaa	no all you have to do is live there is no purpose|`|d265DZbHaa	no - it just is.|`|8LBIeeomaa	nah.no purpose..just try to live a good life..be happy..dont make others sad...and thats about it...|`|jOiS7RpVaa	My own personal opinion of life and death; Heaven and Hell; and God and Satan is as follows: I do not believe there is a God(nor Satan) that is out there. I believe we consist of three parts or three rings as Ram Dass said; the outer ring would be the ego, the inner ring is our soul and the inner inner ring is awareness. When we die the ego obviously goes along with the body and soul dies as well but the awareness that was within the soul lives for eternity. I think that when we die we will see whatever it we expect to see when we die whether it be Jesus, being consumed by a bright light and then just pure extacy, or hell it thats what you truly think you will see when you die. Some may even think that there is nothing after death so they'll just be stuck in a coma/dreamstate of nothingness until they finally realize that their awareness still exists. After this depending on what it is you need to learn or experience to better yourself (to become more aware, to become closer to the God mind) will dictate where you go next (there will be awareness that are further along the path to the god mind that will help you choose your next incarnation) whether it be another physical incarnation or a plane of existence completely different from this one; and if there is nothing left to learn then perhapse you get to live in a spiritual plane for eternity where you are one with God, everywhere and everything at once (the God mind) yet nothing at the same time; this would be a place where time and space do not exist, you simply think and you are. People often look at the conditions in which we live on this earth and become very sad because they look at the people dying of starvation and aids in Africa and such but they're looking at it from the wrong perspective. Our existence on this plane is but a mere vapor in the totality of our awareness of time. It is truly a beautiful thing because they are doing what they came here to do. They chose where they would be born, their parents, the people they're around and the conditions they would live in to better themselves in fulfilling their mission of becoming of the God mind. This doesn't mean don't help people; do everything you can, but just understand that you shouldn't feel sad about the situation; you should be filled with joy that you and they are here fulfilling our role. I think that all the souls of awareness together make up what we call God and we are as the fingers of God experiencing itself. My perspective is different than your perspective and though we may disagree both perspectives are Gods perspective because he is total awareness. Love is the engine that propels us to the God mind.
cxDbdhELaa	With experience, you will learn that their is a right time and place for everything.  Unfortunately, it is usually not when it's most convenient for you.<br>  <br>  Don't try to "force" your apologies onto people.  What's more important to them is that you FEEL the ramifications of what you've done in your soul.  Do not suppress these feelings, rather let them live within you.<br>  <br>  This will help you build character and patience.  An important part of the guilt process is the waiting one must endure...the biding of your time until the right moment is manifest.|`|46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	In and of itself, I do not think it is every too late to apologize.  Having said that, I can imagine a circumstance in which you really hurt someone long ago.  It may be the case that, by apologizing, you will make that person relive a moment he or she would just as soon forget and leave in the past.  <br>  <br>  In the end, these situations likely have to be judged case-by-case.  However, the key when you feel guilty about your past is to make things right with yourself.  Thus, even if you never apologize because you fear it would do more harm than good, it is okay provided you recognize that this is why you are not apologizing.  Atoning for one's transgressions is important, but sometimes this atonement is an internal process, not an external one.|`|AA10895669	It's never to late for anyone to make an apology for anything. In fact an apology if after some time often has more meaning then one given in the moment. Because it says that you have been thinking about it, and it lays heavy on your mind, which means you really regret what you have done have a willingness to repair what you have done and have an extreme amount of remorse over what you have done. (those are the three R in the jews faith that make an apology valid) Regret, Remorse, Repair. Also if you ask for forgiveness three times and the person you have wronged does not accept it, the weight of the wrong is on his/her shoulders and you are absent from any sin involved in the dead.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Like others have said before me and you yourself might know this already.  But it's never too late to apologize when one sees that they themselves are wrong.  And it's made more awesome when you either surprise them for it or they themselves apologize or they are pleased to have that happen.   Life is too short as it is.  May as well walk with a light heart and a happy smile on ones face because of the peace and goodwill that is in your own heart and mind and soul and body.<br>  <br>  Great realization.  Later.|`|2r8iRceQaa	I can just see me saying : "Dude I'm sorry for sleeping with you wife."<br>                                         "Dude I'm sorry for sleeping with your wife."<br>                                         "Dude I'm sorry for sleeping with your wife."<br>                               "Honey, I'm sorry for sleeping with your daughter."<br>  I'd be dodging bullets for the rest of my life.. Sometimes it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.|`|ZhKYHRqpaa	this will be interesting for me to say, well, I have never seem dirty singapore government doggies apologies to me for what they have did leh? agree? imao......apology? u sure?|`|9f3e662ced5c3455403ad740118b4e2baa	It is never too late to seek to make amends. It may be too late to get forgiveness but that does not mean you should not try.|`|8ekoa6szaa	Many long years ago I worked with a woman who was the proverbial Mrs. Nosy Parker.  She was our switchboard operator back in the days when we had pegboards (ask your grandparents if you don't know what one is!!!).  She would listen into conversations and spread the good news far and wide.  I hated that woman with a vengeance.  Well, some years later, long after I had quit that job and moved on, I ran into somebody who told me that Gladys had cancer and was dying.  As luck would have it, I ran into her shortly after that.  While I didn't say "I'm sorry" (for all the hard times I had given her) we did have a very pleasant chat and I ended up hugging her right before we parted. I believe I forgave her and she forgave me during that brief interlude and I know that when I heard of her death a few months later I was glad that we had that last conversation.<br>  <br>  It's never too late to say your sorry.  Just mean it when you say it and learn from your experience.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GyBeE7ofaa	No, it's never too late to apologize, even if it's something you did decades ago. Of course the other person might not accept your apology, but that's their problem, not yours. It will relieve your conscience and that's the purpose of it.|`|ZWk5plojaa	well there is a an old saying its better late than never:) so i don't think its ever 2 late to say sorry to some 1:)|`|9VAnsWYUaa	No, it's never too late. Life's short and there's no fun holding something against ourselves. The right time to apologize for a wrong is yesterday.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Its never too late, even if the other person has moved way beyond the issue and has all but forgotton about whatever it is that you are apologizing for. Let them know that it bothers you and you feel a need to apologize for it. You will feel some relief regardless of whether your apology has an impact on them, because you felt you needed to say it and so you did.|`|GBRmOem8aa	Well dear.... I am not going to give you a pity speech.... so I honestly think that you need to ask yourself that, you need to look deep within yourself and you need to divide the people that you were considering apologizing to in 2 groups, of the people that would forgive you, and of those that would not forgive you..... you need to think deeply and thoroughly about this.... and this is something that is going to either change your future for the good or for the worse... you need to decide, and you need to choose whether or not you are going to apologize.... You cannot let others decide this for you.|`|5nYC6RM1aa	Why would you think that you're apology isn't enough? When you apologize, apologize from your heart and mean it, I mean really MEAN IT. That's all you need and if you try to do anything more, just seems artificial.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	not everythiing can be apologised for because these damages created are beyond repair n sorry for. e.g. can i say sorry after raping u? hahaha....ruin your futuren youth  n say sorry i screw up?|`|YmtNel5haa	The only time it is too late is when one of you die.<br>  You know that old  cliche, better late than never....

I can think of a few:  financial/economic, social, governmental, personal relationships etc...<br>  You can't live your life worrying about disaster. I agree you want to have some grip on things but at the moment not much is secure and safe. <br>  Until this morning my life was heading for definite disaster as I was going to go for a head on with my employer because of rumours spread about me.  Talking to someone in the know I now feel that there is another perspective and it makes me willing to hang on.  <br>  Sometimes we need to forget about "disaster looming" and just make the best of it.  It may pay off.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Well you might be, but I am heading towards bed, in a minute or two.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Yah, it depends on how you define disaster. Financially, economically, and materialistically, it seems to be a stong possibility now. But this might not all be bad; a complete cleansing of our current system could cause people to "wake up" to the other aspects of life they may have ignored in the comfort of their materialistic, money-controlled perceptions, and see the greater, more human sides of life. Who knows?|`|doeg7JSaaa	We are already there if you believe the media, but its not all doom and gloom.

We will all end up dead.|`|AA11219693	We think so, but we hope not. Our expectations are even worse, as they remain subjective to the trepidations of our whims and fancy. The best way forward we find is only in our methods of caution and care. We make sure that we do good things in life so that we may reap good reward, so that the same good may come round to protect and safeguard us from any mishaps in the offing.<br>  <br>  The future of everything is uncertain in the mind, for this is the nature of the mind as of this world, but within the very uncertainty remain possibilities for all things alive, for in certainty absolute, all things would end, nothing new would ever happen. Then yes, we are all unwittingly head towards disaster, as we all aim for certainty in life.<br>  <br>  We are all unwittingly head towards disasters except in the acts of our faith, as the certainty we find in form of a good faith is certainty of truth. This is as opposed to the aforementioned certainties of a mere materialistic existence whereby we measure the situations and circumstances of our life in terms of materialistic possessions, successes and achievements.|`|GyBeE7ofaa	Yes, indeed we are. You dont' need to be a scientist to see that within merely 200 years, humans have destroyed a large chunk of Earth's biosphere and are currently using up its resources faster than ever. Such lifestyle cannot be sustained for long. The result won't be merely the global warming, but also mass migrations, economic collapse, civil strife, wars and famine. It's not just doomsaying, it's just common sense.

"was british empire a good thing?Economically it was good for England.The commerce with colonies flourished.Great Britain purchased the raw material from the colonies, brought it in England to supply its manufacturing industries and the finished was sold back to the colonies.Great Britain after the defeat of Napoleon  enjoyed a century of effectively unchallenged dominance, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe. It became  the biggest (maritime) power in the world.Millions of people from Great Britain emigrated to the colonies ----------------------------------------... Empire<br>    The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom (UK), that had originated with the overseas colonies and trading posts established by England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922, the British Empire held sway over a population of about 458 million people, one-quarter of the world's population,[1] and covered more than 13,000,000 square miles (33,670,000 km2): approximately a quarter of Earth's total land area.[2] As a result, its political, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was often said that "the sun never sets on the British Empire" because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous territories.<br>  <br>  During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Spain and Portugal pioneered European exploration of the globe and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires bestowed on Spain and Portugal, England, France and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (following the 1707 Act of Union, Britain) the dominant colonial power in North America and India. However, the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America in 1783 after a war of independence was a blow to Britain, depriving it of its most populous colonies. Despite this setback, British attention soon turned towards Africa, Asia and Oceania. Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of effectively unchallenged dominance, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe. Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies, which were reclassified as dominions.<br>  <br>  The growth of Germany and the United States eroded Britain's economic lead by the end of the 19th century. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, for which Britain leaned heavily upon its Empire. The conflict placed enormous financial strain on Britain, and although the Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the war, it was no longer a peerless industrial or military power. Despite emerging victorious, the Second World War saw Britain's colonies in South-East Asia occupied by Japan, which damaged British prestige and accelerated the decline of the Empire. Within two years of the end of the war, Britain granted independence to its most populous and valuable colony, India.<br>  <br>  During the remainder of the 20th century, most of the territories of the Empire became independent as part of a larger global decolonisation movement by the European powers, ending with the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. After independence, many British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations, a free association of independent states. Some have retained the British monarch, currently Elizabeth II, as their head of state to become independent Commonwealth realms. Fourteen territories remain under British sovereignty, the British overseas territories.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Emp...</a>|`|AA12095483	Wars are never good things - whether they are British wars, or American wars or Tongan wars. People get killed, things get destroyed, and in the long run, the problems are seldom solved. <br>  You might want to look at the more positive aspects of the British Empire - it was basically developed through trade and it brought many new things to Britain that they might not otherwise have experienced - everything from foods (such as oranges, pineapples and bananas) to fabrics (silk and cotton) to toys (like the yo yo) as well as the more important technical and medical advances.

The upper and lower frequency poles are higher (closer to the string) and the mid-range poles are set lower (further away from the string).

Those troops were in a pocket, after counter attacks by the Russians on the flanks.  Hitler refused to allow it.

Plus the German goalie was rubbish.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	There are many reasons, here are but a few that you can research for your essay:<br>  <br>  Inferior forces - much of the German flanks were made up of Hungarian, Romanian, and Italian troops, who lacked the equipment and training of the German forces<br>  <br>  Lack of mobility - one of the strongest assets to the German army was its mobility, its capability to move and amass forces too quickly for the enemy to react.  This didn't work in Stalingrad, as most of the fighting took place within an urban environment.<br>  <br>  Weather - Russian fall/winter.  Enough said.<br>  <br>  Germany was stretched too thin - the German air force was vital to its success early in the war, but as more and more territory was claimed they began to spread too thinly, greatly reducing their effectiveness.  <br>  <br>  An interesting side topic - the 1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment<br>  It should allow you to squeeze another couple of paragraphs out.|`|AA11304025	Entirely due to the interference of Hitler.<br>  The generals wanted to pull back from Stalingrad once they felt the strength of the Russian resistance as they did not want to be caught there fighting a winter war far from their supply bases.<br>  Hitler was obsessed with taking Stalingrad at all costs because it was named after Stalin and he thought would be a significant boost to german morale.<br>  The outcome was that the Russians were too brave and smart to be defeated in the city and eventually Russian troops encircled the city from north and south cutting off the germans from being resupplied and the germans surrendered on February 2 1943|`|6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	Russian Doggedness, plus they were surrounded on three sides, eventually four, short of supplies, reinforcements, ammunition and food, not to mention they didn't have winter clothing. Secondly they were told they couldn't withdraw while they had the opportunity to do so and thirdly the flanks of the German salient were manned by second rate Axis allied troops.|`|AA10438532	the winter was the biggest problem. they were short on supplies plus the bitter winter. they were freezing to death and starving.|`|WZNaNvplaa	Simply put, not enough supplies. Stalingrad lay at the end of a very long supply line. While Germany was able to reach the city, it wasn't able to funnel enough troops or supplies to the city to finish pushing out the Soviets. Instead, the Soviets were able to gather enough troops to counterattack and cut off the 300,000 or so Germans in the city. As pointed out earlier, Hitler would refuse the military commanders in Stalingrad to attempt to break out. With the Wehrmacht lacking the manpower to send help to break the encirclement, and the failure of the Luftwaffe to supply the trapped Germans, it was only a matter of time before they were defeated.<br>     One point about winter fighting. This was not the first year, but the second, that Germany had been fighting in Russia in winter. The troops were in fact better prepared and adapted for such fighting. Nor was this winter as harsh as that of the year before, nor were the troops as far north, where the climate was colder. So while the season made for a more miserable time, it was not a deciding factor in the siege.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	The reason why Germany lost at Stalingrad (Russia) was because they couldn't take the cold Russian weather, the Germans didn't know the lay of the land well (the Russian forces did), they had run out of supplies, and almost every town that they came upon in Russia was burnt by the Russian army so that they couldn't get any supplies and food from the town(s). <br>  <br>  The German troops were weary and homesick and couldn't over throw the Russian forces.|`|c12ff2f01aee1d7228df9c10d0d77908aa	All of the above, especially about the 2nd rate foreign contingents.  Another factor, not covered, was the lack of armoured support.<br>  <br>  Originally, the 6th Pzr army had more troops allocated to it.  I.E. they actually had a pretty reasonable armoured contingent.  This however, was dispatched to secure the Caucasian oil fields.  This left 6th Pzr Army understrength.  Also, although the original orders were to get to Stalingrad, no reasonable thought had been given to getting into the city and so, the understrength infantry sat around for a while and when they did attack, it was into the centre.  <br>  <br>  Stalingrad was, primarily a long, rectangular city that followed the river.  If the 6th Pzr had attacked from both ends at once, the Russian defenders would have been hard pushed to deal with them.<br>  <br>  The second problem was Hitlers national pride.  He wanted the city taken and overturned the man on the ground, ordering them to expend their force in taking the city.<br>  <br>  The Germans, as pointed out, were not equiped for winter.<br>  <br>  Goring swore on a stack of bibles that the Luftwaffe could supply the troops on the ground.  The reality was that he did not have enough aircraft to supply 1/4 of the troops on the ground, even allowing for enemy action.<br>  <br>  As also pointed out.  Hitlers stand and hold order.  If the Germans had bypassed the city, cutting it off on the vine and retaining mobility, then the German Army could have dealt with the city later.  As it was, by standing in a slogging contest, they allowed just this to happen to them, as the Russian reinforcements bypassed the city and cut off 6th pzr army.<br>  <br>  Hitler did not allow the 6th pzr to break out of the city (See Goring above).<br>  <br>  In short, some really good troops, as well as the other foreign contingents allowed themselves to be cut off and surrounded.<br>  <br>  Luck|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	The answers concerning the cold and the poor tactical position are quite accurate, but when it comes down to it, an invading force of some 400,000 German troops who really dont know why they are fighting against some 3 million Russian troops defending their homes ... well ... you do the math|`|cwJrCcguaa	One reason was that Stalingrad had become a political objective by both Stain and Hitler, although it hadn`t any real strategic value, both Dictators were determined to win and the Russian forces were more numerous.|`|hkLdUjznaa	The transport aircraft the wermacht were relying on to supply the garrison from the air were destroyed by the british and US air forces in the latter stages of the tunisian campaign.|`|UuQAPHJtaa	because they were weaker than the people they were fighting|`|9030d7e77c630401d23f5177b57f3d36aa	Geography, Weather, Supply Lines all were factors in any siege. <br>  But for a short answer there were more Russian Bullets flying than Russian Bodies falling which had to be demoralizing to German troops.
d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	It's just spin; it's a lot harder to be proud of fighting to defend a terrible thing like slavery than a noble idea like states rights. The problem with the states rights argument is the Fugitive Slave Law that the Southern States demanded as their price for allowing California to be admitted to the Union. It would be hard to imagine a law that trampled on States Rights more than this one, which "made any Federal marshal or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave liable to a fine of $1,000. Law-enforcement officials everywhere now had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a runaway slave on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf. In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Slave owners only needed to supply an affidavit to a Federal marshal to capture an escaped slave. Since any suspected slave was not eligible for a trial this led to many free blacks being conscripted into slavery as they had no rights in court and could not defend themselves against accusations." <br>  This law was actually opposed by some Southerners, but not because it infringed on States' Rights, but because it didn't infringe on them enough. The position of the Southern states was always consistent; they favored States' rights to protect slavery against the Federal Government, but they supported the Federal Government to counter any limits to slavery in other states or territories.|`|AA11563787	I would contest that Lincoln was a "radical northern abolitionist" at the time he was elected.  Most historians agree that he was OK with slavery in the states in which it already existed, but did not want it to expand into the territories or any new states.  This is not the stand of a radical abolitionist.<br>  <br>  The southern states seceded because they felt that the federal government was trying to tell them how to run their sovereign states.  The Civil War was fought, first and foremost, to preserve the Union.  Lincoln realized that if the Union was successful the slaves could be freed, hence the Emancipation Proclamation.|`|haWw3B8aaa	People need something to cry about. They always will. The more they cry about something, the more they'll start to see things that aren't there or tend to stretch things.<br>    Almost like people getting " probed " by UFOs.|`|WZNaNvplaa	You are correct. Though I'm not sure I'd categorize Lincoln as a "radical" abolitionist. His speeches and writings make it clear he considered holding the nation together to be a higher priority than the ending of slavery. While he would certainly move towards that particular goal, the Southern states largely overreacted to his election and chose to secede rather than seeing what he would actually attempt to do. <br>     But you have to remember, the majority of Southerners were not in fact slave owners. For them, it was more about the threat the North was to their economy, which was in fact slave based. What most of the soldiers of the South would fight for was the fact that Northern soldiers were setting foot on Southern soil, and trying to forcefully impose political changes on the South. It was this that drove many, if not most, Southerners, to fight. Robert E. Lee himself chose to fight for the Confederacy because he considered himself first a Virginian, then an American.<br>     So yes, slavery is the  elephant in the room when it comes to why the war was fought. But it was an elephant with a giant tablecloth on it. Many people simply looked at the tablecloth and considered it an very strange table, rather than peeking under the cloth to see the truth beneath.|`|AA10344737	Actually, Lincoln was a rather racist man and couldn't care two cents if there were slaves or not.  He used the liberation of slaves as a political pawn that helped the North win (by turning the war into an issue of slavery and not states' rights, England refused to come to the aid of the South, which they were since that is where they received their cotton.  However, once the reason changed, since they were against the concept, they couldn't morally help the South).<br>  <br>  The south also used slavery for their states rights.  With the 3/5 compromise, they had a greater majority when it came to politics because of population.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying slavery wasn't an issue, it very much was.  They just didn't like Lincoln for other reasons.|`|AA12071655	It WAS fought over State's Rights. The instant issue was slavery, yes, but it could have been anything that per the Constitution should be a State's right. The issue goes deeper too: remember that the House of Representatives is elected based on the population of a given state. The Southern states were largely agricultural and had a significantly smaller population than the industrialized northern states. This meant the South was significantly under-represented in Congress. The North was using this advantage to tax the snot out of the Southern states and there wasn't a thing they could do about it. Things came to a head when the South tried to include blacks in the population count - this led to the Missouri Compromise which allowed that slaves counted as 3/5 a citizen. That is, fives slaves counted as three citizens in population to determine the number of representatives.<br>  <br>  Only thing is, the number 3/5 was specifically chosen by the over-represented North to still not allow the South to have an even footing in the House.<br>  <br>  Slavery was almost a side issue but was used by the North to gather an emotional appeal for the cause. When Lincoln freed the slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation he didn't do so because it was the right thing to do but because of the unrest and instability it would cause in the south.<br>  <br>  Don't let the emotional appeals warp your thinking: the whole thing was about power and politics, period.|`|5bzJUmh4aa	It was about states' rights - a state's "right" to own slaves!   <br>  <br>  Lincoln was not a radical abolitionist, but he did strongly oppose the EXPANSION of slavery into any new states.  This was the issue that caused the South to secede.  They knew that any new states admitted under Lincoln would be free states, so the slave states would become more and more outnumbered in the Senate.  <br>  <br>  The previous answer's characterization of Lincoln as not caring at all about slaves was a bit harsh.  While it is true he did not support full equality for blacks (very few whites back then did), he did state on several occasions before the Civil War that slavery was morally wrong.<br>  <br>  It is also true that Lincoln did not campaign on a platform to abolish slavery, but that is only because he did not believe the President had the Constitutional authority to do so.  Lincoln could only issue the Emancipation Proclamation because the Southern states rebelled.  By rebelling, this gave Lincoln broad powers to suppress the rebellion, which included confiscating the "property" of the rebels.<br>  <br>  Oh, and the 3/5 compromise was part of the original Constitution, long before the Missouri Compromise.  And even with counting 3/5 of their slaves in their population for the purposes of seats in the House of Representatives, the slave states were still outvoted in the House.  They really just wanted to keep at least equal representation in the Senate.

iJzIIEdfaa	Modern Croatia lies on Illyrian/Dacian lands. However that is not to say that is what they are descended from. The Macedonians fought with them (Japodians) almost constantly and successfully established colonies there, as did the Romans (Dacian Kingdom under Burberista). <br>  <br>  The Hunnic invasion forced tribes in Attila's path to migrate which is probably where the Slavs would enter the equation. The Avars would also move through the area warring on the Slavic tribes in the vicinity.<br>  <br>  As for the Iranic origins, I don't think they migrated that far west since they would have to have done it very early on, and the Hittites were in their way.
46492533ddbb2d578f91de5478f1e7f3aa	There is a logical fallacy called "Post hoc ergo propter hoc."  Translated this is "After this, therefore because of this."  In essence, this fallacy explains that it is wrong to conclude that, simply because Y follows X, that Y was caused by X.<br>  <br>  One somewhat interesting illustration of this fallacy involved a man who, in days long past, indicated that he was able to create rats.  He would take a box with a small amount of food and old (read smelly) socks in it and leave it out overnight.  Sure enough, every time he did it, he'd have rats the next day.  This was the man who could create rats out of a small lump of food!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, if one could demonstrate that X always prcedes Y when Y occurs, and the Y always follows when X occurs, it is tough to state that X is not a cause of Y.  However, until one can demonstrate beyond a mere temporal link that X results in Y, it strikes me as a recipe for sloppy research to assume that 100% correlation implies causation.<br>  <br>  One more thought that parallels this theme:  I'm a lawyer and work on civil cases in the United States, in which one must prove his case by a "preponderance of the evidence," which means anything more than 50%.  Having said that, if I know someone was hit by a blue bus, and I can prove that 80% of the blue buses that travel where this person was hit are run by XYZ Corp., I still have not established the evidence I would need to win my case.  It is not enough to demonstrate that the correlation is 80% sure.  Some greater evidence of real causation is required, even in a field where 50.01% is enough to win.<br>  <br>  It's an interesting question, and I'll look forward to reading the thoughts of others.|`|CIkNuSZ8aa	Are you thinking of the mind/body problem?  <br>  I would use the brain/mind as an example of using correlation to attempt to establish causation.  <br>  However, even when you have 100% correlation you do not have identity, since a cause is never the same as what it causes.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Correlation of what--that they have the same colors?

Edward Seymour, Earl of Somerset declared himself Royal Protector, he was a radical reforming protestant and this had a major impact on images.<br>  <br>  When any new monarch came to the throne every parish was investigated and reported to determine the beliefs, images and property of every church. It was taking stock of religion. It was also an inventory of the churches riches, 'purely out of interest' although two years later all the riches of the churches was taken by the state.<br>  <br>  Injunction 28 from Edward Vi’s Royal Visitation of 1547, addressed to the parish clergy (W.H. Frere, Visitation Articles and Injunctions (Alcuin Club Collections XVI, London, 1910), II, p.107):<br>  <br>  Also, That they shall take away, utterly extinct and destroy all shrines, coverings of shrines, all tables, candlesticks, trindles or rolls of wax, pictures, paintings, and all other monuments of feigned miracles, pilgrimages, idolatry, and superstition: so that there remain no memory of the same in walls, glass-windows or elsewhere within their churches or houses. And they shall exhort their parishioners to do the like within their several houses.<br>  <br>  Injunction 28 was much more sweeping than the previous one, it said that all images must be destroyed (or those that were abused). Destroying stained glass was not even done in the rest of Protestant Europe. Note it even includes people's private houses. The following year, 1548, it was further clarified as all images and 1548 was the year of mass destruction.

Im not trying to be big headed but i was better than most of the others in our squad. I do gymnastics and that really helps!! Especially with tumbling and basic moves like cartwheels etc.You should try to startstretchingg to do basic things like the splits. You could also start to dance, take a jazz or street dance class to get used to learning moves fast and performing them fast. Why not see if there is a cheerleading camp on so you get some extra stuff? or you could ask someone who cheers if they could help you out and give you some tips.

I even think the science fiction and fantasy writers website has shady agent listings.<br>       A critque of a manuscript is a critical analysis or evaluation of a subject, situation, literary work, etc.  It isn't editing or correcting the work but merely the person telling you if they like it and why or why not and what they think can be done to make it better.  Be wary if your 'agent' recommends someone or a company that you have to pay for.  Similarly if the agent charges for editing the manuscript or critique find someone else.  All of your fees should come out of your 'signed' publishing contract and watch out for if you are charged a 'mailing fee' or 'presentation fee' again even if you pay for them once you are signed with a paying publisher these aren't costs that aren't a part of an agents normal overhead.|`|02O0SnUWaa	you shouldn't have to pay for anything untill your book is out in the open and published, so i wouldn't send it to anyone here on yahoo answers. and your agent should help you with that.  but i don't think you need to pay anything! unless its like new york times or something...|`|AVYBazOEaa	The agent should read it for you.<br>  Do not pay for it though, there's no need at all.<br>  If the agent is for real, they will read it for free.<br>  Don't send it to a random person online.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	I suppose almost anything is possible.<br>  <br>  But consider that it is almost a trivial exercise to also collect a room-ful of moral abolutists, each of whom have DIFFERENT standards of right and wrong.<br>  <br>  Does this suggest that all of them are mature, but all but one of them (or perhaps even all of them) are just wrong?  Or does it suggest that 'figuring out the difference between right and wrong' is not so elementary as some might make it seem?<br>  <br>  Perhaps moral relativists are just those who choose to abstain from a position rather than assume what is likely to be an incorrect one.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	I think they are operating under the assumption that reality can be contained by rational intelligence, rather than understanding that rational intelligence is an aspect of reality.  In other words, since absolutes cannot be defined, they must not exist.  These people have never pursued analysis of relative intelligence to a point of discovering that relative definitions are ultimately self-reflexive, e.g. sunyata, and thus have never had the need to question the validity of the first assumption.  After all, "When left unanalyzed, the goal we all accept."|`|f6xuH9P9aa	Those who follow relative theory may eventually reach the conclusion that in 'the grand scheme' there is no right or wrong but can nonetheless still find their own meanings for right and wrong within the context of their lives and so live amiably with other people.<br>  <br>  I would separate how someone understands the world from how that someone acts within the world.  Hypocrisy is rampant in that people with 'immature thoughts' nonetheless hold them in for the sake of other people.  Immature relativists act immaturely.  Mature relativists, on the other hand, believe what they do but act within the context of society.|`|AA11532374	There simply are no objective right and wrong as far as we know.<br>  <br>  Absolutists... are they simply vain?

(i am bad at poetry) <br>  perfect poetry is sort of .. out of place and unnatutral i think...<br>  <br>  but yours is bloodyy fabulouss :)|`|qhAef3LQaa	Wow.. verrrrry good.<br>  Fancy taking a look at mine?<br>  Would appreciate it <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtgVXSUPbJaZ9TRqMXnNiGkgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226111521AAS4lhL">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a> :)<br>  Seriously well-written poem you've created though, very well done xx|`|KTjweTuiaa	its excellent|`|88a2e933993f652ca67674dcbd1fceacaa	I liked it, very unusual for a 13 yr old - such extensive vocabulary!<br>  The only part I didn't like was 'lungful tweet', the imagery just didn't work for me. Of course, it's your poem, so if you like it that's all that matters for now.|`|AA10862145	Good meter, rhyme is a bit weaker. Some nice phrases, but it lacks a little cohesion, as if it is strung together rather than crafted. The imagery is not quite there.<br>  <br>  But given you are 13, I would say it would stand out against your peers.|`|LhV10HZcaa	I really like the poem apart from the line "his working limbs", this line breaks the otherwise very nice flow of words. <br>  If it wasn't your intention to break the flow, I'd rewrite the poem.<br>  Good piece of writing.<br>  E <br>  X|`|HJe6PbVkaa	this is really good,<br>  great couple of phrases<br>  keep on writing! <br>  if you wouldn't mind looking at some of  mine i write too?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlyFfNC7tbLCZAMxz4GagAbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225141659AAcJgha">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11635487	4th stanza, 2nd line doesn't seem to scan too well (to my ear) BUT it is otherwise excellent.

I've recommended it to many people. But just so you know, it has some mature themes in it.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?

A4qtTlKSaa	Kingston University is meant to be one of the best in the country and competition is fierce.<br>  <br>  Also Norwich, Bath Spa, Falmouth, Brighton and Bournemouth are good.<br>  <br>  An art foundation course is the best way to get into a good University. Its kind of a stepping stone between school and university and plus the tutors on your course are usually in the know about which is the best route for certain courses.<br>  <br>  Of course the foundation is not essential but it is good as you can have a taster of graphic design, along with other design courses and get plenty of guidance and information from your tutors who work within your chosen industry.<br>  <br>  Go to as many open days as possible.

AA11918249	Hello:<br>  <br>  I forget the specifics, but I will give you the general stuff and really philosophy is all about learning different ways of thinking so that you can refine your own way of thinking...so telling you the answer really doesn't do any good because the point is to help you understand.  But yeah.  <br>  <br>  Berkeley was an Empiricist and ran counter to Descartes Rationalism (experience vs thought respectively).  While Descartes thought that the senses couldn't be trusted while Berkeley felt all we have are our senses.  While Descartes might say "this wax its melted now, its solid then, it smells funny, whats the deal with this wax?" Berkeley trusts his senses and studies the wax and uses what he learns to form an idea.  <br>  <br>  Really they both use their senses to study the wax, Descartes need his proofs to know he can trust his senses and then do what Berkeley does anyway.  Berkeley needs god to be there to keep looking at the wax when he doesn't have time to so it doesn't go away.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  Rev Phil
iiudu8Beaa	Both. It hindered them in that it confirmed many peoples [especially men's] opinion that women were too emotional and tempremental to vote sucessfully. However it was definately a much faster way of getting what they wanted - compared to the suffragists. Many suffragists decided that their methods were too slow and so formed the suffragette group to get what they wanted faster. <br>  <br>  Although their militant methods did confirm many opinions that women would not be suitable candidates to vote, it did also, however, impress many people in that the women were passionate and fought hard for their beliefs.<br>  <br>  So violence was both a hinderance and a help to the suffragettes.|`|NYU37jfGaa	It is my opinion that the violent tactis used by the militant suffragettes hindered them, since their actions aroused great public hostility.  Peole who might otherwise have sympathised with their cause were put off the whole thing by the vandalism etc.
iw9yogtMaa	Depending upon the experience and the talent of the crew and cast, pros and cons may be quite similar.<br>  <br>  The director faces the biggest challenge in most productions because it falls to him.her to choreograph the production so that it is not static. There will be movement so that the actors play to the entire audience. Those productions often use microphones so that no one in the audience misses anything.<br>  <br>  In this way every actor onstage is ON all the time - for a professional, that is obvious, for amateurs, perhaps not so obvious and perhaps more difficult.  It should make for a unique acting experience if you have a chance to be in this type of production because you should rapidly learn that you truly do act with your entire body.  Your back, spine, shoulders, neck become much more important than you might have realized as they must express as much to the audience as your face and voice.<br>  <br>  Theater in the round has been around for a long time.<br>  <br>  Here's a Wikipedia article link:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_in_the_round" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_in_...</a><br>  <br>  The scenery and the lighting will be designed differently and that can be challenging.  Set design has to take into consideration that changes will be made in blackout conditions - in some productions by the actors and not the crew.<br>  <br>  For the audience, round is sometimes considered more intimate. If the production is good, that can be a plus.
xdWzrpiOaa	The advantages are that the audience feel included in the play, and equally the actors on stage feel included in the audience. Traditionally, end-on staging is best for plays that don't break the fourth wall (don't interact with the audience), whereas it is easier to interact with the audience in the round because they are all around you and are usually closer to you.<br>  One disadvantage is that it is very intimidating having all those people completely surrounding you; it kind of gives the feeling of claustrophobia, because there is no where you can onstage to be away from the audience. Also, having your piece in the round means you have to be much more careful about how you structure your piece, because you have to think of if you will be able to be seen by the audience. You have to have actors in diagonals rather than straight lines, and you will always have your back to one side of the audience, which is a disadvantage in terms of watching a piece of theatre in the round.<br>  Overall though, if you want a break from the traditionary staging, in the round is nice to go see and always challenging to perform in. Hope that helped!|`|3H7i5LQYaa	Advantages are that the audience has a much more intimate experience, there is less division between actors and audience. <br>  The biggest thing in acting in the round is total body engagement because you have be acting to the people behind you. You can not get away with face acting in the round. Also, you must have impeccable voice work, diction, volume, etc.<br>  It can be very challenging to perform in the round
t5Nrj6Txaa	The "secret" is really akin to a spiritual placebo.  By baiting people with material rewards in addition to using various persuasive techniques and trying to sound like science, "The Secret" can convince all but the most cynical materialists (those who don't understand that a positive outlook improves the quality of life) to improve their mental environment and learn how to focus the attention.  For example, the most die-hard fan of the secret I know is also the most negative person I know.  It's no surprise then, as she learned to shift her focus from everything that is wrong with her world to a more positive outlook, her quality of life improved significantly--making her a huge fan.|`|AA11564934	wow, ask this a few thousand more times please|`|A01w1dHqaa	We perceive what we believe. That doesn't mean it's true.|`|urIm4YaBaa	The law of attraction isn't a law: it's a hook designed to catch the desperately gullible.<br>  <br>  Reality is objective. Things are what they are. No amount of wishing will change these facts. Thoughts are not causally sufficient for change. Thinking, without any corresponding actions, will never make a car drive to you as its new owner, it will save a person from a heart attack, or bring food to starving people. If you want something, you need to work for it.<br>  <br>  Understand, having a good attitude does count for something when it comes to continuing motivation and presenting yourself in a positive light. However, that doesn't mean that success automatically manifests for people with good attitudes just because they had a good attitude. They still have to invest the time and energy into getting what they want.|`|AA11935914	Being attractive to the people you judge to be deserving of your values, is all you need to concern yourself with.  How to judge them is the main question.  Of course being true to your own values comes first.<br>  The Secret lovers, like religious folks,  hate judgment.  They are attempting to cheat reality|`|66eKcJE3aa	I absolutely believe it.. our thoughts and what we tell ourselves will turn into our reality for the most part, yes i do believe this!!! :)|`|McwWG9EHaa	We become what we think about.

When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains.

You could also try Unfinished Tales by Tolkien.<br>  <br>  Other ideas? Gothic Tales by Elizabeth Gaskell. The Virgin Of The Seven Daggers by Vernon Lee. The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse. The Woman In White by Wilkie Collins.<br>  <br>  If you want vampire like stories, there is Dracula by Bram Stoker, but Stoker wrote other novels. The Lair Of The Whiteworm is quite unusual, and there is also Jewel Of Seven Stars, which is a Egyptian style story which inspired a few mummy films.<br>  <br>  One idea could be to try second hand book shops, because there you could buy books cheaply and if you weren't keen on any at least you won't have spent too much.|`|BzMQejGxaa	I agree with Aba.

wEEOvu5Waa	I base my image of vampire from the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice.<br>  <br>  I believe that vampires should be abnormally beautiful, but not in the 'hot' kind of way everyone thinks Edward is. A vampire is first and foremost a predator, and humans are its prey. What attracts a human? Beauty. Even if a human was relatively ugly when they were transforms, we would perceive them as beautiful.<br>  <br>  Every movement they would make would be graceful, dramatic, but almost as if they were not really moving. Every movement would lure you, would dazzle you. They would appear so inhuman, so incapable of their own easy movements, like dancing water, that we would be unable to comprehend it. It would be like we were drunk, or on a high. Everything about them would be graceful and lean, but full of strength. They could be compared to a crouching tiger, beautiful yet deadly. Cold, and calculating.<br>  <br>  Not once did I ever see Edward being described like that.<br>  <br>  Then, the blood. I refuse to believe that a vampire would go on the veggie diet, feeding off of animals. Maybe as a last resort, but not because they chose to. A vampire needs blood, and they want it. They crave it. Not only is it like a delicacy to them, but they relish in the feel of life blood pumping through their dead veins. They crave it. For a vampire to give up human blood...ha.<br>  <br>  For the sun thing and all of their powers, I dislike that each vampire she had was given a unique power. They're vampires, not super heroes. A vampire is strong, fast, their senses are sharp. I believe that some can read minds, but nothing like the vamps in Meyers book.<br>  <br>  I also see power coming from age. With Anne Rice, if you were made by an old vampire, who would usually be strong, you would in turn be slightly stronger than the average one. Lestat was made by a very old vampire, and drank blood from the first vampire (in the series mind you), Akasha enough to where he was almost as powerful as the ones who were over centuries and centuries years old. He even goes into the sun for a few minutes to tan himself so he can better blend into humanity. Since the older you become the paler, colder, and more statue like you become. Power becomes of age.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	I picture beauty: but not a teenage girls fantasy beauty.  I picture gothic, classical beauty... dark, piercing eyes, long, tied back hair (must have picked up this feature from Anne Rice), a waxy, pale tinge to their skin- not abnormally cold, just... cooler than normal.  Not incredibly strong, and bold looking; actually, looking graceful, light, and at peace with the world.|`|x5NzYL8Taa	I picture them like Stephanie Meyer. Pale, Good looking, Dark hair and eyes, Some sort of power (seeing the future ect.), Act like normal people, Not very sociable, Sunlight make them look evil and changes their personality :)|`|otsuH97Jaa	Beautiful in daylight.. not sparkling but gorgeous nonetheless. Thats how I imagine they get prey... and by night I believe they resemble the ugly corpses their bodies have become over the many years of their life. :P|`|sUgrGy78aa	Definitely not how Stephanie Meyer portrays them.<br>  <br>  Real vampires don't sparkle in sunlight.

Stephenie Meyer comes into it, as does the classical count Dracula and I find my image of a vampire is much closer to you average person than terrifying beast.<br>  <br>  -Skin is pale, flawless, dry (as there are no human body fluids to hydrate the skin) and cold. Not ice cold. Like strolling around the park on a winter morning. <br>  <br>  -Eyes are dark hollows in the face. Usually black and the white part is, well, white as white can get. Between the iris and the white part is a thin ocean blue line which can only be spotted if you look really close. Think black lashes and a natural, almost eyeliner effect.<br>  <br>  -Lips are blood red and provide a shocking contrast to the paleness of the skin. Thick, with a prominent cupids bow.<br>  <br>  -Sharp teeth, two of which are perfectly pointed, but unnoticeable so.<br>  <br>  -Fluid, calculated movements.<br>  <br>  -No so much strength, more power which runs through their bones. Like when the President walks into a room; everyone is quiet at this mighty figure, even though it may only be the word president that implies that power.<br>  <br>  -Sharp mind<br>  <br>  -Thirsts for human blood, but animal will do, but the thirst will only be subsided for a short time, so to keep it at a satisfactory level, feeding must be regular.<br>  <br>  -Sunlight causes damage, like sunlight can cause humans damage, but in a faster and more brutal form. Consequences are sketchy at the moment.<br>  <br>  -Can fit in among humans but a natural instincts in humans alert them that these so called 'people' aren't normal, but they cannot decided what. This causes isolation, but all a vampire itelectually craves is a humans company as they find them amazing in the way the feel so much and can control so many emotions. Of course, there's the constant physical thirst. So there's always the conflict of physical and itelectual cravings going on inside.<br>  <br>  sdj x|`|n4CTT2NUaa	Tall,<br>  <br>  Pale, (this one is a nobrainer)<br>  <br>  I think they have dark hair,<br>  <br>  Dark, almost black eyes,<br>  <br>  Graceful, (well if they dont die then well, you sort of learn how to become more graceful)<br>  <br>  Savage sometimes. (come on, they thirst for your blood. they have to be savage.)<br>  <br>  Muscle-ey. (well, if the are going to suck somethings blood they might as well get good abs for it)<br>  <br>  I dont think nesesarily fast. They dont have to be speedy.<br>  <br>  Thats sort of what I picture vampires to be like.<br>  <br>  <3 sammyh|`|k9wpYE7Caa	I wrote about vampires for a time...I was really addicted to the European vampires; the ones in the legends. I'd imagine them to look like humans, but with paler skin, perhaps thinner. Their eyes would be animal, and when you looked into them you knew they weren't human. They move with grace almost like they're dancing, and are fast, with wild instincts. They would be smart, have attitudes, and generally evil. (I vant to suck your blood!!)|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Well. I actually imagine a vampire as....well, basically....I don't really know how to explain it. Of course, though, vampires are not real and are luckily very, very, very, very fictional. I think that they are like normal people, beautifully pale, kind of vicious, and can be good or bad, they DO have fangs and suck blood and can't go out in the sun and that's why their skin is so pale. So....yeah lol ha ha that's it!!!!|`|59ZESSfPaa	i think that vampires(if they did indeed exist) would not be able to go out in the sun so they would live some where were it's always dark they would live among themselves and wouldn't bother humans, because they could drink each others blood. i think that they would live in peace with themselves and that they could create vampire in two way having a baby vampire or creating a vampire by biting a human.|`|L0Jrx5anaa	As they aren't real that's hard to answer but I don't think of them sparkling in the sun but I also don't think the sun would kill them. A lot of it comes from old myths that were really uneducated explanations. Even Bram Stoker uses the belief that they would bloat after they fed which came from the dead decaying bodies being dug up by villagers.|`|2BpcRwnTaa	when i think bout a vampire i do picture stephenie meyers idea of a vampire now.

The fangs descend from gums.<br>  <br>  But to me, vampires are dark, frightening creatures that would sooner eat you than say hello. They're ruled by bloodlust and insatiable hunger.<br>  <br>  They also aren't horrifically ugly or disturbingly beautiful. They, for the most part, look like everyone else, so you never know who's going to come and bite you. And since the fangs descend, they can hide easier.|`|zgtVxtgtaa	I'm currently trying to come up with my own version.

a9wRfuuSaa	You might like some of the books from the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett or the Xanth series by Piers Anthony. They are suitable for your age and contain lots of humor, but aren't too "fantasy-ish" - some magic and mythical creatures, but nothing too heavy.<br>  <br>  I would recommend starting with The Color of Magic or Equal Rites (Terry Pratchett) or A Spell for Chameleon (Piers Anthony) to start with. <br>  <br>  If you want something a little more challenging, I would also recommend The Hobbit by JRR Tolkein. It is a shorter read and easier to manage than the whole Lord of the Rings and you should be able to finish it.<br>  <br>  You might also like some of the books of Anne McCaffrey, such as the Dragonriders of Pern or the Acorna books.|`|FAUPZeSxaa	His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman:<br>  The Golden Compass<br>  The Subtle Knife<br>  The Amber Spyglass<br>  <br>  Maximum Ride by James Patterson:<br>  The Angel Experiment<br>  Schools Out Forever<br>  Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports<br>  The Final Warning<br>  Maximum Ride: Water Wings (March 16)<br>  <br>  Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare:<br>  City of Bones<br>  City of Ashes<br>  City of Glass (March 24)|`|MNus8Qsiaa	I recently finished this book for AP language, and I really liked it. It's The House of Spirits by Isabel Allende. <br>  1) You could show your teacher that you are reading an AP (college) level book. <br>  2) You could analyze it really well (I can help you further with that if you need my help...let me know...I'll check back on your question later)<br>  3) It's not a boring book at all; it has an interesting plot that actually is very fun to follow. Usually, school books are filled symbolism, and the books are not good at attracting readers with their plots solely. But this one makes you want to keep reading until you finish. <br>  4) If you take AP Language & Composition someday, you would have already read the book, so you won't have to work harder to finish reading the book on a fit schedule. <br>  5) The book is not really fantasy. It has magical elements in the novel, and these elements are meant to be taken seriously. It's magical realism: look it up or ask me. So it is kind of fantasy, but then the story changes a lot, so it's not completely fantasy. So there, you have a semi-fantasy-ish novel. <br>  <br>  I hope you choose the book; it's a great read. You'll have fun. <br>  PS: it's a little inappropriate sometimes. You will have to let your teacher know before hand or something. You should tell her that the worth of the book, in helping you understand and analyze these kind of language arts related things, are more valuable. So a couple of inappropriate passages (they are not that graphic, so it's ok) should not matter as much. Especially if you never mention it to the class in your presentation or paper or w/e you will do on the book. <br>  <br>  Good luck whatever choice you make!!|`|Q70iyG0yaa	try watership down. i read it in 7th. it's a good book from the point of view of rabbits.
Qxx0svOVaa	Take it one line at a time! Once you have that line add another and keep repeating the 1st one u memorized and the 2nd...once u have those 2 down, go on to a third...etc.<br>  <br>  It is also good to record someone saying your cues and then your lines...then you can listen to it over and over again! Writing them down helps and you can also recite them as fast as possible. If you can say them fast without stopping, then you have got them down!|`|iw9yogtMaa	People learn their lines in different ways.<br>  I used to have someone read with me and simply go scene by scene to get the flow.  (One line at a time did not cut it for me because there was no continuity and no way to move and expanf anything.)<br>  <br>  Later I began to mark all the blocking into the script to make sure that my body learned the lines as the character literally moved through the scene..<br>  <br>  Other times I would mark my inflection patterns into the script because I needed that motion of sound to help my memorization and to project the inner workings of the character.<br>  <br>  It is important to understand exactly what is going on when you are speaking and how you are listening - reacting when you are not speaking.  Both are equally important on stage, it is just important to have the lines down.<br>  <br>  Rehearse intently at the rehearsals as well side rehearsals before and after with the other cast members who are available.<br>  <br>  One time our drama coach had the idea that memorizing the lines on the page did not help character development and so she had us make the entire script into a pictograph.  We each made our own.  Mine was a total disaster.  I just didn't learn that way. I found that for me it broke the entire rhythm of the scene.<br>  <br>  Another thing that really helps the total package is understanding the character as you, the playwright and the director see the character.  Get you background and understand how that character will react to the changes in the action, the other characters, herself.  Learn your lines as the character.<br>  <br>  Everyone's memory works differently.  How did you learn other lines?  Because that should be the least of your challenges for a role.<br>  <br>  You are concerned...which means that you will find your way and be just fine.<br>  <br>  Just remember, there are no small parts...only small actors. Dopy and Doc are just as important as Snow White...and probably more fun to play.  So have fun.<br>  <br>  Break a leg.

To those Twilighters, Edward is that perfect man. He's the guy they dream about. He's apparently strong, passionate, protective, and sweet, and that's what they like.<br>  <br>  I don't know if it's fair to say that they all only like Twilight because of Edward. That could be a main reason, but I don't think it's the only reason.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well, that's what I mean. The perfection has to do with personality, as well as looks and everything.|`|JnSrN3guaa	i understand completely!!<br>  <br>  no offense, but i hate the fans that parade about Edward's "hotness" because that's not the reason Steph created the books! I think that the romance is cute and that the plot is pretty exciting! i was at the edge of my seat when i was reading all the books! Twilight should be appreciated for its literature (which i think is amazing and captivating--just my opinion, because i know that ppl say it's ghastly, and i know there are mistakes in her writing, but stephenie is human, and i love her ideas) and not because of the movie Edward, or the fictional Edward.<br>  <br>  I mean, i like Edward, but he's not the only reason i'm a Twilight-fan!

The little twelve year old girl who run around with the newer, movie versions of Twilight, only do it because of Edward/Robert Pattinson. <br>  I hate the kids who like the books for those superficial reasons.

And it annoys people to the point that they diss the book because of it's popularity.|`|cwzH7DVvaa	Gah, I know!<br>  <br>  Angsty telepathic vampire Edward who goes through more mood swings in an hour than a pregnant woman does her whole term. While we have very little clear idea what Bella looks like, we get to hear about Eddiken's gorgeous, transcendental face and body over and over and over again. He's impossibly frustrating because he's been crammed with so many character traits, depending entirely on what the author wants him to be like at the time. He's wicked and teasing on his better occasions, but then swings violently to anger or despair or whathaveyou depending on what someone said to him the second before. You would think 100+ years would teach him to even out that temper a little. He calls himself a monster and thinks he should have died all those years ago, but then totally (but nobly) lords his awesomeness over the mundane humans. And he is awesome. Lest you forget it, he's even awesomer than the rest of his vampire family at everything. And for some reason, he doesn't mind taking high school over and over again - which some would describe as a kind of hell.<br>  <br>  But the worst part about Edward is how he treats Bella. He is initially attracted to her because her smell is particularly attractive to him (okay, I'll bite) and because he can't read her thoughts. (Trust me, Eddikens, I'm lookin' right at 'em, and there ain't nothin' up there worth wondering about.) He knows he's a danger to her (woe!) and tells her straight off that it's better if they not be around each other (sorrow!)...and then he proceeds to hang all over her! And he invites himself on a car trip with her and pulls her to a private lunch table and whispers sweet nothings in her ear but keeps telling her she should go away. Yeah, right! She's 17 and horny, and you're hot and interested! He berates himself once every few pages for putting her in danger but never has the balls to fix the matter because he "just can't stay away from her" and "[she's his] life now." *wretch*|`|phH2dVYZaa	Sorry, you like the PLOT?

(from Wikipedia article; see sources below)<br>  <br>  The key point about Caesar's crossing of  the Rubicon was that by deciding to do so he was making an irreversible decision. Once he and his army were across that stream that was it. The die was cast. He could not go back (without being treated as a rebel).<br>  <br>  Other points that may be important for your question..<br>  <br>  1) Caesar's decision to do so was (ultimately) not any old "irreversible decision" (eg a woman contemplating divorce deliberately flushing her wedding ring down the toilet) but an historically momentous one as well, with ultimately affected large numbers of people and which hadg all sorts of other ramifications (eg the fall of the Roman republic and its replacement by what was essentially a dictatorship: the Principate (aka the Roman Empire)).<br>  <br>  2) Given that the crossing was one Caesar himself made (albeit doubtless after consulting his senior officers and other advisers, not to mention the auguries) by "equivalent" you may be restricted to something similar. Namely, those decisions taken by a single person and/or small group.<br>  <br>  (3) Does success matter for it to be "equivalent" to Caesar's, at least with respect to the crossing's immediate objectives?<br>  <br>  For example, a recent Hollywood film "Valkyrie" told the story of a small group of German officers who crossed their own Rubicon when they decided to blow up Hitler. Unfortunately, unlike Caesar's their plot failed and most were executed.<br>  <br>  That said, just what were Caesar's objectives in crossing the Rubicon anyway and did they all succeed?<br>  <br>  Doubtless they did not include his death! Yet crossing the Rubicon set in train the chain of events which ultimately led to his assassination in 44 BC it could argued that even his crossing did not, in a sense, fully succeed, albeit only in the longer term.<br>  <br>  But of course, his death only occurred later, after a Rubicon of a different sort had been crossed, one which made a restoration of the Roman republic impossible, at least for all practical purposes.<br>  <br>  4) Then there is that word "modern", a highly vague term at best. The American settlers crossed a Rubicon in 1776, for example, but since that was over 200 years ago that may not be modern enough! Let us suppose "modern" restricts us to events within, say, the past 100 years.<br>  <br>  So if assume some those restrictions--irreversible, by a single person and/or small group, short-term success required, events over past 100 years only--and reject the rest are there any possibilities?<br>  <br>  You bet!<br>  <br>  But I am not going to write your school/college essay/assignment for you. Make a list of major historical events of the past hundred years and check out their credentials.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sjMIFH9Faa	I can't say that their are any. Historians, beyond the high school level anyway, are pretty critical with making compairisons between the ancient and modern world.<br>  <br>  My point is this. Because we live in the 21st century, we enevitable try to put a 21st century point of view on historical events. The problem with that is that people in the 1st century BC thought of the world in a completely different way. Its hard to compair ancient events with modern ones, because, although the event may be similer, the manner of thinking during the event would be entirely different. In ancient times a solor eclipse may end a war because its a bad omen, nothing like that would ever happen in the modern world. <br>  <br>  Lets take Hitler and Caesar as an example. Caesar overthrough he Roman Republic and set up a dictatorship, and Hitler took over the Weimar Republic. Pretty similer, right? Well no, Caesar took over with force of arms, while Hitler was elected. Caesar took over because the Republic wanted to prosecute him for illegial warfare, Hitler took power because he wanted to make Germany the pearl of civilization. Hitler was into pureifying the German race, while Caesar didn't really see the world in those terms. <br>  <br>  If you compair them personally, they are seperated by two thousand years of scientific discovery. Hitler saw the world as a globe dominated by societies. Caesar thought of the world as spanning from Spain to India. <br>  <br>  So, although events may be similer throughout history, it is very difficult the compair them side by side because so much has changed, and the way people think about the world is just totally different.
iNXqiDIYaa	Plot Summary<br>  A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings is a short story that begins with a couple, Pelayo and Elisenda, finding a very old man in their courtyard during a stormy afternoon. They watch in astonishment the enormous wings attached to the body of the old man as he struggles to get up from the mud. The couple attempt to communicate with the old man but are unable to as he speaks in a different language. Their neighbor comes over and lets them know that the old man is an angel who has come to take their sick child. Pelayo locks the angel in a chicken coop overnight. Early next morning the local priest, Father Gonzaga, with the rest of the community in town, tests the old man to determine whether he is really an angel, with debated results. Elisenda, tired of having the community at her house, decides to charge an entrance fee to see the angel. The family becomes rich and builds a mansion with the money collected. The crowd soon loses interest in the angel as another freak has arrived in the community. The new town attraction is a woman who disobeyed her parents when she was young and was transformed into a tarantula, and now tells her misfortunes to the audience. In order for her to continue telling her stories, the people of the town tossed meatballs into her mouth as it was "her only means of nourishment." Meanwhile, no longer trapped in the chicken coop, the angel is free to roam around the house until one day he leaves the house and flies off away into the distance.
BjXdRRuLaa	wide angle lenses distort features and they are a big no for portrait work.<br>  you need something around the 80mm length.<br>  <br>  j|`|bxlYleZkaa	You could, if you wanted to give all your subjects big noses and funny shaped heads!! Seriously, this is a wide angle lens and as such will inevitably give a noticeable peripheral distortion. A 35 mm would do at a pinch, ideally something between 70 and 85mm f1.2  if you can get one!|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	Yuck, no! If you had to capture a huge group of people, then sure. But not for individual portraits - they would not appreciate the distortions.<br>  <br>  Get yourself a little 50mm f/1.8 lens - they are cheap and tacksharp, wonderful little portrait lens on a 1.6 crop factor camera!|`|JXc0O8G9aa	You'd be surprised at the quality that 50 mm f/1.8 produces... Especially for the price.  It's pretty much the best lens per cost you'll get.<br>  <br>  The 10-20 will distort the image quite a bit and is not recommended for real portraiture work.  That being said, getting in nice and close to someone's face (the 10-20 focuses at a ridiculously close nine inches) and snapping a photo produces some pretty memorable images.  I think you'd be safer to consider the 10-20 as a "fun" portraiture lens but not to be used for anything serious.<br>  <br>  There is a Flickr group for the Sigma 10-20.  There's a thread in the group's forums dedicated to this topic specifically and has some great examples.|`|cBNjgxW9aa	If you can cover the 80-135 mm range you should have enough latitude as far as focal length and still stay within general portrait parameters-I was told once that 105 mm was the ideal focal length in 35 mm.  Although that is about right, other sources say differently, the 'ideal' portrait focal length is at least a little subjective.<br>  <br>  A 50 mm focal length is really too short for portrait work; contrary to popular belief, the 1:6 crop offered by the digital sensor doesn't affect the perspective. Just for purposes of example, a 1.5 multiplier effect on a 50 mm lens does give you an effective 75mm focal length, but the relationship(s) of the internal lens elements do not actually change, therefore the perspective remains the same as if the shot were taken at 50 mm.|`|4e55bf2d7b472d9d927ddf7c3220c25caa	Definitely NO.<br>  If you are on a budget, then you can get a Sigma or Tamron 70-300 for about ￡100, albeit being f4-5.6, but should still be ideal for your portraits, as the best length to use is between 70-100.<br>  Also, having the extra length, will be great for wildlife shots also.<br>  They may not be the sharpest lenses, but that is easily overcome. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Nx0KZfoCaa	You are getting a 5D mk2.......but only have the lens that came with you 400D.  Personally I'd forget the 5D for a bit and get a decent set of lens first.  A 5D is not going to get you far without any lens to use with it!|`|duyHLEEnaa	Hey, some photographer like the image that a wide angle lens offers, but you have to keep in mind that if you use it for portraits, you can make your model feel uncomfortable because you need to be really close plus the image will be distorted alot, e.g Big Nose. what it does is emphasises the objects that are closer to you and you will also get alot of the background in it and it wont look im perspective,<br>  <br>  Some of the images look really cool tho.<br>  <br>  the best lens i find for portraits is a 70-200mm f2.8. you can get load of different shot in the same position apposed to a 50mm f1.8, you have to move alot<br>  <br>  Daz XD<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and you kit lens is ok for portrait too.|`|1e9f5631c92a337ee235542a574c8bfeaa	no, i agree with the others - you should stay away from the 10-20 as a serious portrait lens....and if you're going full frame in june you'll just have to get rid of it anyway. <br>  <br>  a 50mm is always a good lens to have, and i'd also consider looking at the tamron 28-75 f/2.8. i'm in the process of getting a nikon-mount one for my d90, and it comes highly recommended. it covers the portrait range - 42-110mm on a crop camera- quite nicely....and you'll still be able to use it on your 5d mkII. oh, and it's only about $300.
ceBTTCPwaa	Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, generally known as Frankenstein, is a novel written by the British author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Shelley started writing Frankenstein when she was 18 and finished when she was 19. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in 1831. The title of the novel refers to a scientist, Victor Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. In popular culture, people have tended to refer to the Creature as "Frankenstein", despite this being the name of the scientist. Frankenstein is infused with some elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the "over-reaching" of modern man and the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The story has had an influence across literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films. It is often considered the first fully realized science fiction novel.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Frankenstein" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Frankenstein</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/frk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/frk/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/frankenste..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/frankenste...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/frankin2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/frankin2.html</a>

B9udEXIIaa	My educated guess would be that it started in the early 20th century, and more specifically right after WWI, which gave birth to the fads and fashions of the 1920s.<br>  <br>  Before that, youth and beauty were almost always used as a symbol for innocence. Even as late as the Victorian Era, young beautiful people, especially women, are a symbol of innocence, both about the ways of the world, and about harsher realities, such as disease and malnutrition. Their innocence is depicted as a kind of beauty in itself, and one that is all the more precious because it will undoubtedly fade very soon.<br>  <br>  The post-WWI era is the first time that I have ever seen where there was a definite shift toward maintaining youth. For example, it's the first time I can think of when women's fashions really demanded young, almost sexless bodies. Full bosoms and hips, which had been in fashion just a generation ago were suddenly seen as undesirable, and undergarment manufacturers started marketing bindings for the breasts, not to shape them, but to make them disappear. Similarly, if you read mail order catalogs or magazines from the period, there is a definite shift to staying young, rather than re-capturing lost youth. Before that period, there were a lot of products marketed to both men and women which promised to restore youthful things, such as energy for women in menopause, or sexual function for aging men. Suddenly, there was an influx of products that promised eternal youth and beauty if you just used the right cream or took the right medicine. And again, in the books of that period, you see a shift from older people being honored for their age and wisdom to them being dismissed simply because they are old. <br>  <br>  I think that the trend which started in the West in the 1920s just continued to grow as the century progressed. Unlike other fads, which come and go, that one stuck. If you even compare magazine print ads from say 1905 and 1945, you see a marked difference. In 1905 the respectable homemaker who was the target of ads for things in the home, such as housewares and appliances, was an older woman, and I would guess from looking at them that she was about 45 to 50 years old. By just after WWII, the very same types of ads showed women who were clearly much younger, with models who appeared to be in their early to mid 20s. I suspect part of it, in advertising, at least, was that the target audience in 1945 were men who were coming home from war, marrying, and settling into domestic life, and that was their age group, but I also think it's indicative of a larger cultural trend. <br>  <br>  Even now, it continues. Have you noticed that advertising icons such as Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker have become younger and younger? When I was a child in the 70s, the pictures of these women on packages of food showed older women with wrinkles and gray hair that clearly stated "Trust me and my products, because I have experience". Now, if you can find the older images and compare them to the newer ones, you see drawings of women who are significantly younger, and free from bothersome wrinkles and grays. <br>  <br>  The saddest thing in all of this, for me, at least, is that what started out as a trend in the Western world is slowly but surely being exported, and has been for some time. I was reading recently that Asian women in Southern California are a huge source of income for plastic surgeons. Traditionally, light skin was highly prized in Asian countries, as it meant that women did not work outside in the sun doing menial labor. The article I read said that about 15 years ago, they started also having a lot of procedures to remove signs of age. This was a real surprise to medical people, as before then treatments consisted almost entirely of skin bleaching and whitening. Doctors have rushed in to supply the need, however, and are now helping 50 year old women look like they did when they were 28.|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	In ancient China, the 4-inch "lotus foot" was considered a sign of perfect beauty. The practice of foot-binding, uncommonly seen today, involved breaking the bones of the forefoot and folding them forward, then tying the misshapen appendage to prohibit growth.[5] Foot-binding caused severe pain, imbalance, and falls, and eventually osteoporosis, because afflicted women were unable to bear weight and ambulate correctly. Other consequences included hip and knee osteoarthritis, chronic pain, and even joint replacement surgery.[6] Chinese foot binding was also a form of subjugation; as a class, women were even less able to take advantage of already limited educational and economic opportunities.<br>  <br>  For ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Persians, sparkling eyes were considered beautiful and they applied the heavy metal antimony to make their conjunctiva sparkle.[5] A woman with a high forehead was considered beautiful during the Elizabethan era, and upper-class Elizabethan women plucked or shaved their frontal hairs to achieve this look. These women also covered their skin with ceruse (lead-based) makeup, which caused peripheral neuropathy, gout, anemia, chronic renal failure, and disfiguring scarring, requiring the application of more ceruse makeup.[5] Chronic users, such as Queen Elizabeth I, acquired a misshapen appearance. Upset over her grisly visage, the Queen banished all mirrors from her castle. Her servants sometimes painted a red dot on her nose, an inside joke mocking her clown-like appearance.[5]<br>  <br>  In the court of Louis XVI, noblewomen drew blue veins onto their necks and shoulders to emphasize their exalted status ("bluebloods").[7] In the 16th and 17th centuries, the wealthy used belladonna eyedrops to dilate their pupils.[5] Users acquired an "attractive" doe-like appearance, but they also risked retinal damage, glaucoma, and blindness. During the 18th century, vermilion rouge, concocted of sulphur and mercury, achieved popularity. Users lost teeth, suffered gingivitis, and (unknowingly) risked kidney and nervous system damage from mercury -- not to mention their having to deal with the unpleasant smell of sulphur.[7]<br>  <br>  Corseting, popular from the 14th to 19th centuries, originally involved compressing the bosom and constricting the waist with tightly wound whalebone on a steel frame.[5] Shallow breathing, combined with inadequate venous return, produced fainting and swooning. Hiatal hernias caused by overly tight corsets are termed "Sommerring's syndrome" -- after the 18th century physician who first warned of the dangers of tight lacing.[8] Christina Larson points out, "the corset facilitated a pernicious association between physical beauty and virtue, as upright posture and a slender waist came to be regarded as evidence of discipline, modesty, rigor, and refinement. Ladies who abandoned their stays were scorned as both lazy and immoral."[9]<br>  <br>  Ideal body weight and shape have fluctuated throughout history, from the rotund Venus of Willendorf of antiquity, to the statuesque, leggy flappers of the 1920s, to the ultra-thin "Twiggy"-inspired look of the 1960s and the "heroin chic" cachexia of the 1990s. In some cultures (eg, Hawaiian royalty), women voluntarily consumed or were force-fed excessive quantities of food to maintain their corpulence, a sign of fertility and power.[5] At other times, women, including those with and without anorexia and bulimia, have dieted, induced vomiting, abused laxatives, and exercised excessively to lose weight. Famed opera singer Maria Callas deliberately infected herself with tapeworms to produce a malabsorption syndrome to maintain her lithe figure.[5]|`|NmvaEmKBaa	Historically speaking, youth, beauty, age, and wisdom pale in comparison to the "ability to motivate people with violence".

People can try to help, but really, its all up to you.. it's your decision. I will, however, give you my best advice(which is pretty rubbish):<br>  Do you have to notify them before the audition that you're going? Or can you just turn up on the day? If its the last one, you could wait till you know the alternative day, or if you don't find out before the audition-go to the audition! If its that important to you, you'll have to miss the lesson. <br>  You could warn your Horse Riding teacher that you may not be able to attend on that day-if you have to notify the audition people before the date. Wait until a few days before but do give time, then if they haven't given you an alternative date you'll have to decide whether to go to the audition or not.<br>  <br>  And about the limited absences: I'm sure they won't expect you to go to Horse Riding lessons if you have a contagious illness. <br>  That's all I can think of. I hope you get to go to the audition, and if you do, Good Luck with getting the part!
5jNBb8Dyaa	If TRUTH were True, there would be Duality. If no TRUTH, then, no Duality as there would be no NON-TRUTH either.  Believe what ever sentimentality strikes your fancy , including the concept of Truth or Soul...or Non-Truth or Non-Duality for that matter.   No harm done.  It is still only belief. No one to believe it anyway.  Get my drift? Great question!|`|AA11635601	This is a fuct example - the soul certainly does exist.

Or use dogmatic ideas about the soul and heaven to start wars and annihilate and torture people. <br>  <br>  My fiance believes in the soul, but acknowledges it is primarily because he wants to. He is not the least bit dogmatic about it, nor does he try to convert other people to believing what he believes, and I don't see a problem with it there. Maybe some slight delusion, but I think we all have that in some measure. For some people, believing in a soul may enhance their life, but for many others, it is actually more dampening as they miss out on a lot of truth that is just as awe inspiring. I myself prefer to study the brain and see how what we once thought was the soul is really this area of the brain doing x, y, and z, but I know not everyone feels that way.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	You are free to believe in anything you want to even when it is proven wrong if that is what you want to do.<br>  I believe in things till I am proven wrong and I do not think they have proven that we do not have a soul yet.  <br>  You are free to feel and believe any way you want to and there is no harm to it unless you go around telling everyone it is only your way of feeling.<br>  I personally hate to see people not believe in God because if he truly is our lord and savior then they are lost forever and that is what bothers me most, but I would not force them into my way of thinking.  They are free to feel the way they choose to feel and so am I.

They believe that to call this physiological phenomena "soul" is to to imbue it with the supernaturalism they are trying to get rid of.<br>  <br>  Nothing could be further from the truth. We all know what our souls feel like. We all know how important they are to our concept of who we are, and to our understanding of own individuality.<br>  <br>  The soul does not have to be metaphysically anything more than something that develops as we develop, and that dies along with us.

K5lWkSNOaa	That's a good question although you're vague in the general sense of which "people" you seek thoughts from. Are you asking the average Joe (of today) what he thinks about the works or scholarly artists/art historians, collegiates, children...who are you referring to? Your answers will also differ according to which century these people are from. <br>  <br>  You may want to also consider the fact that art historians get a pretty good grasp (judgement) on art created after half a century it was created. And their opinions on works will certainly influence the "people" of the time. <br>  <br>  You can find the 'reaction' response of the public in Florence by picking up an art history book highlighting the Renaissance or better yet, Michelangelo himself. Typically in art history cultures are studied as well as paintings and other things. Why not have a source from the period itself?<br>  <br>  If you can answer the first question, I'd be happy to help more.<br>  <br>  ~*~Edit~*~<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A681680" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A681680</a><br>  <br>  Although it is BBC and not a profound scholarly web site, I think you'll find some answers, if not a good start to answering your questions.

VsaEOX9vaa	In Marx view capitalism would eventually collapse and give way to communism because of the class struggle under which workers lived. The workers would have revolutions to bring down capitalist factory owners. He stated that all people would become communists and live in a classless society.<br>  <br>  To a large degree, he was correct, as workers formed unions to bargain for better deals for themselves. What Marx didn't bargain for was the fact that as workers got better conditions for themselves, they too became capitalists, rather than communists!<br>  <br>  When the workers conditions became so good they also became landowners or factory owners and exploited their own workers, who were possibly originally fellow workers.<br>  <br>  Marx ideas were ideals that couldn't possibly be met because he didn't allow for the human character. Even in communist countries the workers who were in charge of other workers found ways to exploit, steal and embezzle, defraud the system, which was only taking away from their fellow communists.<br>  <br>  So, although the basic ideals of communism are good and humane, where all are equal and have similar pay and conditions, it won't work as long as the human character is the way it is. Basically, humans are money-hungry and greedy without thought for those who have little, or nothing. It's probably a basic "survival of the fittest" gene that we can do little about and we are all stuck with it.<br>  <br>  It's just good that there are some people in this world who care about those in need and help in some way, because most people care very little for those worse off than they are.<br>  <br>  Marx goes into my list of heroes, for his thoughts, although unworkable, great thinking.

OYWqaDtOaa	What about Taylor Swift's Love Story or Rod Stewart's Young Turks?  They kind of fit because Hermia and Lysander are running off together.  Also, what about Beyonce's If I Were a Boy?  It fits after Lysander turns on her and falls temporarily in love with Helena.  Maybe Jason Mraz I'm Yours for at the end when she's getting happily married?  Instead of focusing just on her personality, maybe it's easier to find songs that fit her emotions at different parts of the story.  Hope this helped.  Have fun!

VNBJoC89aa	I'd say the responsibility is split between woman A and the drunk driver. Even though the cop and woman b were the ones who ensured that she would be standing in that place at that moment, the same could be said of anyone who has had a small influence in her life. As for the guy's friends, they did not force him to drive drunk, just to leave. Ultimately, it was the negligence of the drunk driver that caused the injury. However, considering the fact that the woman's decision not to have a blood transfusion was what prevented her from living, I would not charge the driver with negligent homicide, but with negligent injury. But imagine trying to argue that to the woman's family?|`|v88EVB9Caa	we did this in law - n in an exam the the answer would be person C because he was the one that actually caused death. however from my ethical point of view, i would say person B, the woman who made an illegal U-turn. if she hadnt have dont that none of this would have happened. <br>  so in a way ur right, from the law's point of view, its perfectly clear. but <br>  from a morality point of view its not clear about who is responsible. <br>  oh and the drunk driver would is definitely guity of homocide, no doubt about that, but who started the chain, now theres a debate starter.|`|nCP2maFfaa	driver B's fault for getting dirver A pulled over in the first place where she got hit by driver C who was to blame for speeding and being irresponsible.

The battle ended soon after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe and the subsequent threat of the Germans to bomb the other large Dutch cities if the Dutch refused to surrender. -----------------------The Battle of the Netherlands (Dutch: Slag om Nederland) was part of Case Yellow (German: Fall Gelb), the German invasion of the Low Countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and France during World War II. The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until 14 May 1940 when the Dutch main force surrendered. Dutch forces in the province of Zealand continued to resist the Wehrmacht in the Netherlands until 17 May. Nazi Germany then occupied the Netherlands; the last Dutch territory was liberated in May 1945.<br>  <br>  The battle ended soon after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam by the Luftwaffe and the subsequent threat of the Germans to bomb the other large Dutch cities if the Dutch refused to surrender.

iBYSd94Caa	-Jealousy.<br>  <br>  Goose bumps covered my skin. My whole body shook uncontrollably. I gritted my teeth and held my breath and tried to control it, but nothing helped. I had tied up my hair off my neck with the hair band I had kept about my wrist since I'd gotten to St. Barths, so the soaking strands were no longer hitting my shoulders. That was something, at least. But how long had I been standing there? How much longer was I going to have to wait? Every moment seemed like an hour.<br>  <br>  And then voices. Angry voices. Adrenaline instantly warmed me. It was Upton. Upton was shouting at someone.<br>  <br>  "...stupid, immature, ridiculous thing to --"<br>  <br>  "We were just having ab it of fun," Sienna's voice replied.<br>  <br>  My blood boiled with anger. I was going to scratch those girls' eyes out the moment I saw them.<br>  <br>  "You should be ashamed of yourselves," Upton scolded, his voice just outside now. "Reed! Where are you?"<br>  <br>  "Right here!" I said meekly, lifting my arm so it could be seen in the space between the top of the door and canvas roof.<br>  <br>  "Are you alright?" Upton asked.<br>  <br>  A towel appeared over the door and I whipped it down, wrapping it around my shoulders. My eyes closed in ecstasy as warmth radiated over my skin.<br>  <br>  "I'll live," I replied.<br>  <br>  "Here are your clothes," Upton said, folding my dress and bathing suit over the door.<br>  <br>  Oh thank God. I quickly stepped into my dry bathing suit and yanked the T-shirt dress on over my head. They felt so warm-like they had been tumbling in a dryer for over an hour-but that was probably just in contrast to the frigid temperature of my skin. I took a deep breath to calm the trembling, and I opened the door.<br>  <br>  "I'm so sorry," Upton said immediately, pulling me into his arms. I closed my eyes and pressed my cheek against his chest. The warmth of his body chased away the last of the shivers. "They said you'd gone back to the Langes'. That you'd come down with a headache."<br>  <br>  "I figured," I said, glancing over at Sienna, whose arms were crossed over her chest as she look imperiously out at the ocean, as if she owned it. Amberly, Paige, and Poppy weren't there. I wondered how Sienna had ended up taking the blame solo, but honestly, I didn't care.<br>  <br>  "I believe Sienna has something to say to you," Upton said, loosening his grip on me.<br>  <br>  i don't want to type anymore..

"Oh my God! You are a total manwhore!" <br>        "Reed-"<br>        "Is there any female on this planet you haven't had a thing with?"  I asked lifting my palms to the sky.  "Maybe it would be simpler for you to list your non-hookups."<br>        "Reed, none of that matters," Upton said, reaching for my hands.  He held them both in his and looked into my eyes.  "You're the one I want to be with now.  Only you.  I swear it.  All of that is in the past.  It doesn't matter anymore."  <br>        I was amazed at how sincere he made it sound.  For a second I almost believed him.  And maybe a ear ago I would have.  But I wasn't that naive anymore.  Reed Brennan had gone through some changes.<br>       "It kind of does matter when i spend over an hour freezing  my @ss off in a dark showers stall," I told him, yanking away my hands.  "This was supposed to be a fun little vacation fling.  And the fun just offcially ended.

"We were just having some fun." She offered me her hand and arched her perfectly waxed eyebrows. "Friends?" <br>  Anger clenched my chest and I pulled away from Upton completely, stepping toward her. "You and I were never friends, and we're never going to be friends," I said, causing her face to fall. "In fact, you and your little posse can stay away from me for the rest of the trip. Far, far away. And I suggest, for your own sake, that you do." <br>  Sienna's thin lips parted in indignation as I turned on my bare heel and stormed off toward the pool and the restaurant behind it. The sun was just dipping behind the hotel. I needed to find my friends and vent before I exploded. <br>  "Reed! Wait!" <br>  Upton caught up to me near the shallow end of the pool and grabbed my arm.<br>  "Thanks for finding me and everything, but I really need to talk to Noelle right now," I said, wresting myself from his grasp.<br>  "Wait. I just wanted to say I'm sorry," Upton told me, his eyes pleading. "Sienna's just being a spoiled child. She doesn't know how to handle jealousy, you see--"<br>  "Jealousy? Wait a minute. I thought she was new here too. What's she jealous of?" I asked, a niggling feeling of ignorance gnawing at the back of my neck. <br>  Upton bit his lip and looked away. "Yes, well...we kind of had a thing last term when she and Poppy came to visit me at school..."

In lieu of roses, wear the red nightie.  There's always an equivalent gesture.<br>  <br>  We do these things to attract and keep the women, just as they do many things to attract and keep us.

I find it fair and I like my guys like that =D!<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|ioLun57Caa	My wife sometimes likes me doing all that stuff for her, but sometimes she gets a little irritated like when I refuse to take the last bagel.|`|fKco44yxaa	Lol....when was the last time a gentleman got the girl over a prick?|`|AA10217752	Simple gentlemanly actions are acceptable such as the "ladies first" thing, opening the door for a woman, or offering your seat to a woman (regardless of age).<br>  <br>  There are, however, "gentlemanly" things men do that I found unnecessary, such as carrying the woman's handbag or shoulder bag, to the point that they sometimes look gay. (Imagine a boyfriend carrying his girlfriend's pink shoulder bag. Que horror! Besides, it's not as if the bag weighs like a sack.)<br>  <br>  On your question of trading places just for a change, this can be done, but with limitations, of course. Paying the restaurant bill once in a while is okay, as long as the man doesn't abuse. Giving a red rose to a man is kind of cute. This can certainly be done. But carrying a man? Come on. Even if the man weighs lesser than me, I wouldn't do it. I doubt if the man will ask that of the woman either (if the man is not you, that is). :)<br>  <br>  Furthermore, you can't say that women have been terribly spoiled. It just works that way. A man needs to be a man, a woman needs to be a woman. Period.|`|RCpkdx4haa	What's fair is fair. Modern women want so desperately to be on an even playing field with men in the workplace, they shouldn't demand anything on a date. If the man pays, she should be grateful, it shouldn't be expected. Independent women, right? The determining factor, in my opinion, should be WHO ASKED WHO OUT?! I've been asked out by women, and I assure you that they sealed their fate after we went out and I was expected to pay. Not even a "fake" grab to their purse. That ain't right. I do, however, treat women with the utmost respect. Compliments, holding doors and opening their doors, skootching up their chair, etc.|`|TA48c3Uiaa	well.. im a type of girl that loves to be shown respect and i do expect my guy to always be a gentleman, but i never demand more then the respect, now bout paying the bills at restaurant, at first i do believe that guys should treat the lady, but no i wouldnt expect that to b like that forever, but it does show that the man is taking care of his lady.. =).|`|xr8j9Tjhaa	many of us have been spoiled. <br>  <br>  i do love gentlemen but i also like doing things for my man. to me it is important to pay the bill, give him surprise gifts, flowers..but i don't know about carrying him in my arms i don't think i can? <br>  <br>  to me it is about balance and finding the things your partner likes/needs and doing those things for him|`|JpfBoRggaa	no, women never liked that. those men are BORING.<br>  who want's to hang out with them? white bread, safe as milk mama's boys...|`|kTBE4dYEaa	I'm a feminist and i don't think women were spoilt, it was more like a business deal. men paid for dinner to "woo" them and once married women did what their husbands told them. the reason women changed their last names upon marriage is because they were passing from their fathers property into their husbands so it makes sense that a potential husband pay for dinner and treat his date nicely because once married the woman was his property. i think paying for dinner was the least he could do!<br>  <br>  nowadays i think the bill should be split, any woman who expects a guy to pay for her is a freeloader and obviously has no pride. and would men like to receive flowers? what would they do with them? i can't imagine what my dad or brothers would do, probably stuff them in a vase and then let them die and turn into compost on the coffee table.<br>  <br>  anyway, "ladies first" is just the remnants of chivalry and women like to be treated nicely. obviously they should treat men nicely in return, but i think carrying a man twice my size is probably a bit optimistic.|`|mXUKca6naa	...98% agree-women enjoy the simple pleasures of manners...<br>  ...2% disagree-women would not appreciate it...

X6nQFXj6aa	It's quite interesting! It grabbed me at the beginning and I wanted to read more. I thought a little of your description was a little cheesy and out of place with the rest, e.g 'See what I mean?' Maybe if you changed it to 'SEE what I mean?' to accentuate the point you just made. I thought that originally and was very entertained.

Maybe, you could continue with the Aunt having to move into your room with you (you, as in the character)  while her new condo is "in escrow" but it turns out: she gambled away all of her money and has to stay longer, or at least until you scream at her for being so selfish because she won't stop complaining about her life, and she goes to your mom, but the mom takes your side and kicks her out.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Hot Zone, A Terrifying True Story is a best-selling 1994 non-fiction bio-thriller by Richard Preston about the origins of incidents involving hemorrhagic fevers and both the Ebola and Marburg viruses. The basis of the book was an article written by Preston for his 1992 New Yorker article "Crisis in the Hot Zone".<br>  <br>  The filoviruses Ebola and Marburg are both Biosafety Level 4 agents (because they are extremely lethal to humans and very infectious), that are often found in central Africa. Along with describing the history of these two illnesses, Preston describes an incident in which Ebola was suspected to be found in a Reston, Virginia, monkey storage facility.<br>  <br>  The original Reston, Va facility located at 1946 Isaac Newton Square was torn down sometime between 1995 and 1998.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hot_Zone" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hot_Zon...</a>
Iwk92vqyaa	<a href="http://www.amazon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com</a><br>  If you are referring to "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair, the reason for the horrible scenes in it wasn't to expose bad food, though the book certainly did that, but rather to expose the cruelty of child labor. You'd see the scenes causing working children a great deal of hardship. It wasn't about general "workers" or "unions."<br>  <br>  The book, if you were to read more, didn't result in the FDA but did cause (ADD: yes a look at the food, but more importantly: ) ...it made a significant contribution for a closer look at child labor laws. That resulted in abolishment of many laws allowing it.<br>  <br>  ADD: As you know, Sinclair Lewis didn't write this book... Ah: the first answerer has now changed her authorship designation for this book to the correct one. Good for her.|`|XHNbU7RWaa	Your reaction is similar to the reactions of most people back then, too. The funny thing is, Upton Sinclair was only trying to get more rights for the workers and unions, not clean up the food industry. But instead of caring about the conditions that laborers had to work in, the public instead was absolutely horrified by the condition of their food- hence, politicians immediately pushed for passing the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906) and established the FDA for safe measure.
9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	Like a lamp shining in a dark room, the philosophy of Enlightenment was supposed to open the eyes of the world's poor and free them from unjust rule. Excited writers and poets believed the spirit of Enlightenment could lift the world from an age of darkness and ignorance into a world of science, rationality and equality. The Enlightenment spread throughout the European continent and even helped inspire the American Revolution. Of all the countries, France most eagerly embraced the ideas of this new philosophy, but what started as a movement for reason, rationality and brotherhood turned into hysteria and slaughter during the French Revolution.???<br>  <br>  The Enlightenment grew popular throughout Europe during the 18th century. To its supporters, the Enlightenment was much more than a philosophy; it was a way of thinking that stemmed from faith in human reason and progress. Enlightenment thought was the culmination of many scientific advances such as Isaac Newton's laws of gravity and writings from Europe's most famous thinkers. These supporters believed that humankind was coming out of ages of darkness and superstition. They foresaw a future where all people were educated and free and liberty reigned as the supreme law of the land. Pamphlets, essays and newspapers filled the streets of Europe all forwarding a new and brighter era - The Age of Reason.<br>  <br>  Enlightened thinkers believed that through reason humanity could advance into a new and wonderful world. These thinkers lived in many different countries and came from many different backgrounds. The most famous Enlightenment thinker was a Frenchman with the very long name of Jean Francois-Marie Arouet to which he later added Voltaire. This writer, playwright, poet and scientist was a friend to kings and queens all across Europe. Voltaire often used humor and ridicule to criticize those he did not agree with, and was the most admired and feared writer of the 18th century. Voltaire's main enemy was the church, which he believed was corrupt and stifled the freedom of thought.|`|zPHo7Ociaa	cheese|`|DnwhJ4F6aa	Government is a contract between ruler and subject; its power is derived from the consent of the governed.

f4Nn0W1xaa	Well, I won't go so far as to say that it's bad but it certainly is unusual. I have never even remotely read that poem in the way in which you did and I had to work pretty hard to fit your thoughts on to it. <br>  <br>  It seems to me that you most likely decided that the wistful melancholy sentiment with which it is laden is inherently feminine. That's too bad, if true, and does a great disservice to the truly masculine. Or maybe, if you're female, you were just identifying, it's hard to say.<br>  <br>  Who knows, maybe being so far off on this read will open your eyes to possibilities you never saw before. In that case it would be a wonderful thing and not bad at all. Find a bright side, every mistake is one more thing learned.

CDmybNeOaa	For what?|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	A query letter should be addressed to a specific editor--spell their name correctly, make sure they read your genre of writing. State the length of your manuscript, the genre and whether it is finished. The body of text should read like a book's back cover copy, summarizing the story in two short paragraphs. These paragraphs should entice the editor. Polish. Rewrite and polish again. Conclude with a paragraph that states your relevant expertise or publishing background or professional organizations. Do not go over one page. Don't forget to include a self addressed stamped envelope for a reply.<br>  <br>  ---  Then prepare to be patient. Answers from agents and publishers can take awhile. If you don't hear anything from a letter, send another in about six weeks. If you sent requested material, and you haven't heard anything in about eight to twelve weeks, then call and check on it. Just ask for the status; they should be able to tell you without it being a big deal.
lGByR3lcaa	I'm sure you have to be at least 18, and in some clubs, depending on laws with alcohol and whatnot, you have to be older than that. Personally, I don't think a 16 year old should want to be a stripper yet, I'm 19, and I'm a stripper. It's not as easy as they make it look on TV and movies, we joke around that working in a strip club is like joining the military(no disrespect to the military personnel), you have fun, you get paid, but it's also uncomfortable and physically demanding. You'll have to deal with bruises, scars, loud music, a lot of drama, strange men grabbing you. It's not like you go home with hundreds everyday, especially in this economy I've seen girls walk away with 30 dollars, take away 20 dollar house fee and that's 10 dollars pure profit. Think of that after the 5 hrs required work, you have to be willing to deal with that too.|`|G73jI8QSaa	i'm not going to bother telling you why you shouldn't strip... u probably won't listen.<br>  it's illegal because of nudity from a minor. you have to be 18.|`|ACG8cTpLaa	18|`|AA10236979	It's 18 in all states.|`|MLlTCJhdaa	I think you have to be at least 18...but I'm not so sure|`|8vfCRg7Caa	nooooo way. im willing to bet against it.

X6nQFXj6aa	I think it's excellent research and not disrespectful, if you're not writing anything disrespectful about the actual people who died, by name. It's the only way. Plus, the experience will help you convey the feelings and bring more depth to the scene that you probably would otherwise not be able to convey perfectly.|`|DsOUrvu3aa	i think it is cool that you want to do real life research but if you do go to someone's funeral that you dont know be very discrete and extremely respectful|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Probably best to imagine the funny stuff yourself - there probably aren't that many funny scenes in real-life funerals and you'd have to go to a lot, not to mention gatecrashing a stranger's funeral isn't a good idea, it's considered a bit rude and weird. If you go, be discreet.<br>  <br>  You can watch "Death at a Funeral" too.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|pvKbsrzaaa	welll i was at a funeral once and there was another funeral going on also.<br>  while my funeral was done we were walking out and the funeral next door was interrupted by a cellphone ringing.<br>  turns out it was the dead mans cellphone ringing.<br>  he interupted his own funeral -___-<br>  & once my cousin went too a funeral were some little kid jumped in the casket wit the dead lady cos he wanted too take a ''sleepy poo''<br>  lmao|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	I haven't personally experinced anything the least bit funny at a funeral. I think it might be a good idea to attend someone else's whether you know them or not. But just stay on the down low (I don't suggest hiding.) some people would be very offended if they knew what you were doing. Yet again, a writer has to do what a writer has to do!|`|cvTzLEoBaa	I don't think it's funny, sort of ironic, but..  A guy died, and at his funeral his cell phone rang.

I've never heard of sakar or digital concepts. You can pay a few bucks more and get special coatings and all that too if you like that is supposed to cut down on all the reflections that filters cause. The easiest thing is just to leave it off.

LPsmRI5Oaa	They didn't want to provoke Hitler into declaring war on them.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	The American people were completely disinterested in European affairs.  The horrors of the WWI trenches combined with the day-to-day misery of the Great Depression.  In Britain, who had, after all, taken even more serious losses in WWI, the effects were magnified.  Moreover, both the British and French were willing to try to trade away land (including land that didn't belong to them, like the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia) in order to purchase peace.  Another large scale war was just too horrible to contemplate.  Finally, you have to remember that nobody really knew until too late just how bad Hitler was.  He was elected to office, and became Fuhrer by popular acclaim.  How could the democracies of Europe convince their citizens that a popular and elected (even if not elected to the office her eventually held) leader was reason enough to go through another great war?  <br>  <br>  In hindsight, we can see that each concession the British and French made to Hitler only made him more popular and emboldened him further, but at the time, this was certainly not clear.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	People didn't want war. They preferred to hide their heads in the sand.<br>  <br>  Same same as today with Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. No one wants to acknowledge the clear and present danger.|`|kTBE4dYEaa	it was easier not to interfere.<br>  <br>  Germany had a lot of restrictions put on them by the treaty of Versailles after WW1, so they were only allowed a small army, weren't allowed to take any more land, had to pay millions upon millions of dollars to the allies among other things. the people of Germany were desperately poor and Hitler promised them he could fix their problems.<br>  <br>  so when Hitler started breaking the rules the allies were like oh we'll let them have a bit more land, it's not worth fighting over. and when he started putting the Jews in ghettos they didn't know, but later they were just like well they're not dead so we'll let it slide.<br>  <br>  WW1 was so devastating no one wanted to go to war again. so although the US and Britain were far more powerful than Germany they didn't want to take drastic action.|`|dbgQgYscaa	The POWERS that emerged victorious from World War I made a second war almost inevitable by the peace conditions they imposed upon Germany. That second war was later made certain, not by the intentions of Hitler but by the determination of his enemies to destroy the new Germany that he had created.<br>   <br>  By the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919 and the Treaty of St. Germain on 20 September of the same year, the German people were thoroughly humiliated. The British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, wrote: 'The international bankers swept statesmen, politicians, journalists and jurists all to one side and issued their orders with the imperiousness of absolute monarchs.' <br>  <br>  The Daily Mail reported on 10 July 1933: 'The German nation, moreover, was rapidly falling under the control of its alien elements. In the last days of the pre-Hitler regime, there were twenty times as many Jewish government officials in Germany as had existed before the war. Israelites of international attachments were insinuating themselves into key positions in the German administrative machine.' Resentment and resistance began to build up against the alien horde and in the year before Adolf Hitler came to power Bernard Lecache, President of the World Jewish League, stated: 'Germany is our public enemy number one. It is our object to declare war without mercy against her.' <br>    <br>  On 24 March 1933, on the front page of the London Daily Express appeared the main headlines: "Judaea declares war on Germany: Jews of all the world unite", and followed with: 'The Israelite people of the entire world declare economic and financial war on Germany. The appearance of the Swastika as the symbol of the new Germany revives the old war symbol of the Jews. Fourteen million Jews stand as one body to declare war on Germany. The Jewish wholesale dealer leaves his business, the banker his bank, the shopkeeper his shop, the beggar his miserable hut in order to combine forces in the holy war against Hitler's people.'<br>   <br>  The German government was removing Jews from influential positions and transferring power back to the German people. This declaration of war by the Jews on Germany was repeated throughout the world. The first boycott of Jewish business concerns came after this Jewish declaration of war in April 1933. "The German nation is a threat to us Jews." <br>  <br>  --Emil Ludwig Cohen wrote in his book The New Holy Alliance, Strasburg, 1938: "Even if Hitler at the last moment would want to avoid war which would destroy him he will, in spite of his wishes, be compelled to wage war."<br>   <br>  Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had given an assurance that: "The British Government would never resort to the deliberate attack on women and children and other civilians for the purpose of mere terrorism."<br>   <br>  However, his successor Winston Churchill appointed as his personal adviser the Jewish Professor Lindemann. Lindemann, later Lord Cherwell, suggested the bombing of German cities and that working class areas were legitimate targets, and from then onwards the last vestiges of civilised decency in warfare were abandoned.<br>   <br>  These bombings began on 10 August 1940 with the bombing of the small open town of Freiburg on the Swiss frontier. Fifty-three civilians were killed, including twenty children playing in the park. It was reported by Mr. Taylor of the American Red Cross in the New York Times of 3 May, 1940. This was before the Germans began bombing British cities. Mr. J. M. Speight, CBE, Principal Secretary to the Air Ministry, wrote in his book The Splendid Decision:<br>   <br>  "Adolf Hitler only undertook the bombing of British civilian targets reluctantly after the RAF had commenced bombing German civilian targets. It gave Coventry, Birmingham, Sheffield and Southampton the right to look Kiev, Kharkov, Stalingrad and Sebastopol in the face. Our Soviet allies would have been less critical of our inactivity if they had understood what we had done... Hitler would have been willing at any time to stop the slaughter. Hitler was genuinely anxious to reach with Britain an agreement confining the action of aircraft to battle zones."<br>  <br>  In 1941 a Jew, Theodor N. Kaufman, wrote 'Germany Must Perish.' Kaufman set out a plan for the total destruction of the German population by a very simple method: the mass sterilisation of all German men and women between the age of puberty and sixty years. He described the construction of the organisation for doing this. This book was the basis of the Morgenthau Plan for the total destruction of German industry and the enslavement of the German race. Naturally these intentions of Germany's enemy got into the hands of the German propaganda minister Goebbels, and it stiffened the resistance of the German nation to avoid defeat. The Morgenthau Plan formed the basis of discussions between President Roosevelt and Soviet leader Stalin acting through his liaison officer, the Soviet Jew Zabrousky, and also formed the basis of the Yalta Agreement.|`|dSLCH5gHaa	The US and Britain were only aware of Nazi germany annexing other nations but they werent aware of the holocaust until after the war.|`|lUzonjLfaa	If Hitler didn't interfere with them why should they interfere with them ?'<br>  Hilter wanted to emulate the Jews  not the others until he went crazy with the 1000 yea old reich.
cgz85foTaa	No, they're just very close and care for each other a lot.  People might get the wrong impression while reading it because at times it does seem like "incest", but it's pretty much the way that it's worded.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	I'm not quite sure but I think there is a little bit. They kiss and that's it.
cgz85foTaa	Louis and Lestat feel as though Claudia is their daughter; they are all a family, so no, that is not pedophilic.  Armand was taken by Marius when he was around 16 or 17.  Pedophilia is when the child is really young such as anywhere from 3-12 years old. It does not include teens such as Armand.  There was a sexual relationship between them, but it was not pedophilia.|`|kYgU8NHAaa	It's been a long time since I read these books, but I think yes, maybe Marius was a pedophile.  But I don't think you could say that about Louis and Lestat.  Claudia is a little girl when she's turned into a vampire, but she is very old by the end of the first book.  It's a strange relationship, and there's nothing like it in real life.  But I wouldn't say there's anything immoral about Louis' love for her, although it was immoral, in my opinion, for Lestat to turn her into a vampire at all, because until her death, she's a very old vampire trapped in a child's body.

cKzfxE0Zaa	You shouldn't use romance as the genre of your first book because it will sound flaky to older readers who have, you know, actually had lovers and been married a time or so and have known how real people act in situations that you can only dimly imagine.<br>  <br>  Instead, your first story should be pure fantasy. How about writing about a planet run entirely by girls, ages baby through 25. There aren't any older girls because at age 25 or 26 the vampires come down in their starships and take them away to another planet where they are put into a big factory and converted into "blood soda" (think of huge razor blade choppers, corpse compactors, and strainers to filter out the bones and stringy bits).<br>  <br>  Girls from ages 18 to 25 are the mommies to the next generation of girls. They get prego by the "rapists" who zoom around in flying cars. Of course some of the girls don't try too hard to get away because the vampires will leave them alone if they're pregnant.<br>  <br>  You can throw in Mad Scientists who like to do experiments on girls, often involving some sort of potion that does something weird (and usually fatal) to whoever drinks it. If a girl tries to get away from the Mad Scientist, he presses a button on his black top hat, and the lid of the hat opens and a mechanical arm comes out with a gun on the end and shoots the escaping girl. Bang. Shoulda took her chance with the potion.<br>  <br>  And of course there are monsters. There's the Swamp Demon, the Mangy Mangler, the Abominable Snowman, and Oscar the Ogre, just to name a few. (Feel free to invent more!)<br>  <br>  There are also witches, who are evil older women who the vampires allow to live on the condition that they serve as a kind of eugenicist, culling the girl herd of diseased or defective girls whose blood isn't all that good-tasting. The witches are taught a kind of magic that lets them fry girls brains. Actually, it's a kind of microwave gun, but the girls think it's a magic spell.<br>  <br>  The girl society refuses to admit how hapless it is, and there are all sorts of girlie groups who are organized to "fight back." A few of these are the GUTS rangers (Girls Undertaking Tasks Suicidally) and the Sisters In Service Saving You (i.e., the sissies).<br>  <br>  Now with THIS kind of universe you can have some FUN! Just think up a heroine for the story and let her have lots of adventures while her mates get killed off left and right, while the heroine muddles through without ever quite getting bitten on the neck or zapped into a crispy critter by a witch. Focus on writing scenes that show the girls interacting socially. Eventually, you'll want to do something more serious, but you probably aren't ready for it yet. This kind of silly-fantasy universe will sharpen your writing skills without betraying that you don't yet have a high level of skill. Nobody knows what to expect of your characters because they are so far out of tune with real life, so you can get away with a lot of unrealistic stuff.|`|E0chY1b5aa	Oh yeah; you'd really have to "Live" it..|`|ZNRYqss9aa	Don't use twilight, it's badly written and the storyline actually sucks.<br>  <br>  No offence but this isn't your story it's someone else, your not using your imagination, change it completely explore the world of stories and please don't write the way Meyer does.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Try writing about like fairies not being what you think they are.

Why not make one character fantasy and the other real. The fantasy character falls in love with the other but the other is not interested. Your twist on vampires could be a comedy. Think about it, a vampire that wants love not blood. The conflicts could be endless! If vampires are your favorite genre, go for it but put a different spin on it. Get strange like, Vampires On America Idol or My Neighbor Is A Vampire. What about a storyline where a vampire gives birth to a non vampire? Get weird like, a vampire is in charge of the country's blood supply.

You probably just have vampires on the brain, which is normal if you've been so inspired by the book to write another.<br>  Brainstorm.  Ask some questions.  What powers would you want to have?  Be creative.  You can create your own creature.  Where do you want it set?  When?  Do you want a throwback to the 80's or is the setting modern?  At 13, you should keep it modern since you weren't alive in the 80's or before 1995.  <br>  Maybe you should start with a short story.  Write a few and expand on the one you like the most.<br>  The important thing is to write often.  It's half talent and half hard work.|`|3yRSWwd8aa	Really, your best bet is going to be your imagination.  The cliff idea is fine, although its been done in movies and books several times already.  Creating a book isn't so much about having original moments or original scenes....but it is making them feel unique to the reader by how you represent that idea with your words.  Do you decide to show it from the viewpoint of the aggressor, a bystander, or a hidden character that noone knows about until the last chapter?  Don't worry so much about an original storyline or setting, but worry more about how you will convey those images with your words and how they will be interpreted by others.|`|7kbrbFxPaa	Every author is different. They all have their own style of writing. It just takes a while to get into your own unique writing style. <br>  <br>  Inspiration comes randomly! Just going around to the store, or sitting alone in your bedroom, anywhere inspiration can hit! So, I suggest you always carry around a notebook just in case you have an author's inspiration moment. It is also good to research your book setting, and the kind of characters in your book. Good luck!|`|E0GfSbFsaa	Girl falls in love with an angel. Or the other way around if that sounds twilightey.

You go from there.|`|YDB8kpUAaa	I know what you mean. Just relax and get away from all those damn twilight books and posters and songs and everything! Go outside and think for a while. Go to the mall and observe people. You can find pretty interesting characters there. Read a few other books and seperate your mind from constant twilight. I know it's a great book, but you don't want to rewrite it. Don't be too afraid of sounding like it - a lot of books have plots like Twilight. It's more of just the talented way the Stephanie Meyar portrays her characters and spins words around your mind. Everyone has their own unique way of writing, and I'm sure you'll find yours. Good luck! :)|`|ZugTPhnzaa	Okay I'm 16 and I am in the process of writing a novel right now too. Just put Twilight out of your mind. If you are serious about writing a book it's important it's original and all your own ideas. For inspiration, I like to go to places where I am writing about. If I'm writing a chapter in a mall let's say, I go to a mall. Pick up on conversations, take notes on the atmosphere and the surroundings. Or if there's a part set in the woods, or by a cliff, etc.. It's also important to know about what you are writing about. DO YOUR RESEARCH. I tried for years to write a good novel but failed every time because I didn't have the knowledge on the subjects I was writing about to really feel comfortable and confident with the words.<br>  First you need to story board. You need to get some things straight like the year you are setting your story in, where it is set, what you want to achieve, a basic plot, questions you want to raise, characters, twists.

Me kicking someone else simply because I don't like them isn't acceptable...because apparently it just isn't...<br>  2. Me kicking the Midget interferes with his human rights...human rights are a paradox...you cannot do what you want without harming another persons human rights...but then that goes against ur right to do whatever you want...<br>  <br>  <br>  tbh philosophers try to rationalize things like this into greatest happiness or most useful or crap like that...we should be allowed to do whatever we want whenever we want but understand anything can be done to us back (Hobbes - the state of nature)

Ok, make sure to do it sooner than later. Don't be scared, the sooner you do it, the more thrilled she/he'll be. The later, the more upset.

Now you only have half a semester to prepare for some sort of audition. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|35GfsJ3Paa	I was pretty apprehensive about telling my teacher (this was about 3 years ago, part way through high school). I stammered out "I aahh ahh, w-w-want to be a music major..." My teacher answered, "Well, then you need to be practicing a whole lot more." And I did. And, well, now I'm a clarinet performance major/English education major at IU. It worked.<br>  <br>  Definitly tell her ASAP. She can't help you prepare if she doesn't know that this is your goal.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to hear a variety of answeres from your teacher. She might tell you "go for it" or she might have some major concerns about things you need to do first. It is your teacher's job to be supportive, of course, but it is also her job to be realistic.
QkFnEIWSaa	Technically, they knew that the Earth was round for a very long time. They knew it even back in Aristotle's day, due to the shadow cast by the Earth on the Moon during an eclipse. The Earth as the center of the Universe lasted a bit longer, since they did not realize that gravity is a property exhibited by all matter. They thought that there was some point in the Earth that drew everything towards it.

9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	A renaissance man or polymath is a person who is skilled in multiple fields or multiple disciplines, and who has a broad base of knowledge. The term renaissance man is largely based on the various artists and scholars of the European Renaissance, (starting in about 1450 CE), who pursued multiple fields of studies. Perhaps the quintessential renaissance man of this period was Leonardo Da Vinci, who was a master of art, an engineer, an anatomy expert (for the time), and also pursued many other disciplines with great success and aplomb.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	A term still used for one accomplished in many of the arts - a reference to the style of gentleman in Quattrocento italy who was interested in arts and sciences - particularly architecture and design.|`|fF1WbPltaa	Leonardo da Vince is a very good example.

C0xGFq2Qaa	I agree with Stephanie completely.<br>  <br>  I'm in college and I've been playing clarinet for 7+ years now, since the beginning of middle school.<br>  Anyway, by year 4 I started getting bored with my instrument.  Band class was no longer really interesting me, the pieces were too easy, and like you, I would start getting really bored.<br>  My fifth year I started taking private lessons with another tutor.  He was amazing.  These lessons made the clarinet feel new again. I suddenly Wanted to practice and I saw a huge improvement in my playing and music reading.  Try to get a good private place for music and do see if you can get another teacher or tutor.<br>  I also suggest trying another instrument if it interests you at all.  Even with the new lessons, the clarinet still felt like a school thing for me.  I picked up guitar on my own about 2 years ago and since then it's become my biggest hobby.  The guitar made music so much fun that I even found myself playing more of my clarinet as well just to keep my music styles varied.  Consider it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  :D|`|5737f0111f183aa3e07767b0362ccc9caa	1)  Research shows that people who start at young ages (like 4 and 5) tend to "burn out" at about your age.  9 years is a long time!<br>  2) Practice can be forced, but music can't.  <br>  3) I'm a music teacher and a performer, and I feel so stressed at the thought of your mom's expectations and comparison with your friend that I can't bear it already...  <br>  <br>  I have two thoughts:<br>  1)  "Crosstraining."  That's the magic word to use with your mom to explain why exploring some other instruments now would actually help your violin playing.  Look up the biographies of some of today's good players, composers and conductors.  Many of them took breaks (sabbaticals, vacations, whatever you call it).<br>  2)  Use your instrument to express Your emotions.  For example:  Just thinking of you possibly only playing your Level 4 requirements makes me angry and frustrated.  Hey, I can play that emotion!  I'm afraid that maybe your friend plays better.  I'm very sad that life is so tough and booooring and that any of us can be made so helpless like this.  I think it's amusing that I can tell people exactly how silly I think all of they're "requirements" are without them ever knowing that I'm "sassing back" with the notes.<br>  3) "Wrong notes" -- do you have access to YouTube?  Or, do you have some other presentation of the music that you could play along with?<br>  4)  Ask your mother what her expectations are from the money she spent.  A chair in the orchestra?  A professional career?  National fame?  Make sure she knows that you care how she feels, and don't want to disappoint her.|`|zl0YHMD5aa	i would try another instument i play flute it is very fun and drums is to so i would try flute as grade 1 is very very fun<br>  xx amz|`|dtqmM7dWaa	i used to play recorder then the violin then i played the trumpet an finaly the bass guitar, an then i realized i didnt like music XD but seriously i think something more modern like the electric guitar i found guitars fun but i didnt have the time to practice. or mabye you could try something like music production, i gave that a go but im not dedicated to anything so i quit, but it was fun download fruity loops i heard tht was good for begginers or reason which is alot better but harder. hope this helps.|`|uW8B2T7Waa	As a music teacher, it's easy for me to see the answer to this. You're getting too much outside pressure....and there are other reasons as well.<br>  Number one: Tell your mother that in order for you to grow, and that's what she wants, you have to have the full room to be your self on your instrument without anyone else's involvement, no disrepsect intended. <br>  Number two: You may be seriously in need of a transfer to a different teacher. I've had a student stay with me for ten years, but if you are not motivated any longer, than you need a switch. If you are thinking of giving up your instrument, try switching teachers first, and don't be embarrassed about it. Print this answer and tell your mother it's coming from a music teacher from a highly prestigious music school. <br>  Number three: Try for a little while, playing something different, perhaps not totally classical. I bet that's all that you're doing right now. I'll never forget learing Scott Joplin after the birth of my second child! It also increased some of my technique although I never would have suspected it at the time.<br>  Number four: As far as talent and the number of years you've been playing: The girl I taught for ten years was talented, but not as talented as one I taught for four years who went on to a college professor. The second student was more endowed with talent. All students have different amounts of talent. Don't belittle yourself on your gifts. I hope you will be happy you've got the ability in the first place, and believe me, I've had numerous students who had no rhythm. I can see you've got plenty of rhythm!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. <br>  I know your frustration.<br>  Do go to your mother with this letter and reconsider what your doing. You need space and consideration. You certainly don't need a yelling mother. For you to be going online at Yahoo states that you've got a serious difficulty with gaining space and respect with your mother! Take courage in stating that to her. I know. My own mother disrespects me. But I've overcome much.<br>  Good luck!|`|vIwBlWDDaa	tricky situation and i'm a vocalist and had a break for a year from vocal coaching and stuff and felt the need to come back so if you stop violin, theres a big possibility that you will regret it so what i did was before going back to lessons i joined the tees valley youth choir, so maybe you should join an school orchestera or strings orchestera or something like that, just a thought :)

WLizHwtkaa	Almost certainly. As the link for the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust below states: "John Shakespeare was a prominent citizen, serving on the town council for many years and becoming Bailiff, or Mayor, in 1568. Besides his craft as a glover, he traded as a wool dealer and was also involved in money-lending." It's unlikely he could have been mayor without being literate.
yvyewZrWaa	I recommend "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Baroness Orczy -- it's more in the classic vein of the romance-adventure genre, but still very enjoyable. If you want more of that sort of "dark" romantic stuff (similar to "Twilight"), you should read "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Bronte (assuming you haven't already).|`|wKSvnna2aa	OUTLANDER by Diana Gabaldon, but it's an adult book. My favourite love story.|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Evermore by Alyson Noel<br>  Ever was a normal high school girl living a pretty good life. But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?<br>  <br>  I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I'v never read it before but I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too|`|E0GfSbFsaa	It is semi-romance, sort of, but read ''Pretties" by Scott Westerfeld.

Russia also ceded the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan.<br>  Only five years after the war, Japan de jure annexed Korea as its colonial empire, and invaded Manchuria in the Mukden Incident 21 years after in 1931. Russo-Japanese War<br>      The Russo-Japanese War  10 February 1904 – 5 September 1905) or the Manchurian Campaign in some English sources, was a conflict that grew out of the rival imperialist ambitions of the Russian Empire and the Empire of Japan over Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea.<br>  <br>  The Russians were in constant pursuit of a warm water port on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The recently established Pacific seaport of Vladivostok was operational only during the summer season, but Port Arthur would be operational all year. From the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, and 1903 negotiations between the czars's government and Japan had proved futile. Japan chose war to protect its exclusive dominance in Korea. Russia, meanwhile, saw war as a means of distracting the populace from government repression and rallying patriotism in the aftermath of several general strikes.[1]<br>  <br>  The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the balance of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government and proved a major cause of the Russian Revolution of 1905.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War#Assessment_of_war_results" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japan...</a>
AA10923178	I just looked it up for you. The Treaty of Shimonoseki ended the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). The Treaty granted independence to Korea.<br>  Japan received the Liaodong Peninsula in northeastern China and the island of Taiwan. The Chinese also agreed to pay Japan about $150 million and allow the Japanese to run factories in China. But Russia, France and Germany forced Japan to return the Liaodung Peninsula to China and accept an additional payment instead. I hope that this has been a help to you.

For example, while I'm really quite against censorship, I don't see why elementary schools would feel the need to own a copy of Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales because there are honestly more age-appropriate (ie more interesting and accessible for children of that age group) fairy tale books and anthologies available.  However, banning books in general just leads to trouble, so I wouldn't be in favor of it.|`|zgXpomfCaa	I don't think it should.

ZmdIlkpQaa	The Anglo American forces (which included the US, Canada, Great Britain, the Free French and Free Polish forces) overcame the Atlantic defenses with the use of massive naval gunfire, some air power and the bravery and determination of some hundreds of thousands of Allied forces.  Keep in mind that while well fortified, the German forces holding the wall were actually low-quality troops for the most part.  Additionally, the parachute drops of three divisions of troops inland greatly limited the ability of the Germans to move up reinforcements, as did the complete dominance of the air by the allies.  It should also be noted that Allied efforts at deception had been very successful, and as a result, Hitler and much of his high commend believed that Normandy was merely a feint, and thus did not order the powerful tank armies held in reserve to the North (at Pas de Calais, among other places) to push into Normandy.  Finally, the fact that the Allies could simply pour such huge numbers of men and such massive amounts of materiel and weapons into the fight was also critical.  For example, by July 25, a month and a half after the landings, Allied strength was more than 1.4 million men.|`|MI22i1Bwaa	The British bombed the coastal batteries, and shelled them from their ships.  Then, the British, Americans and Canadians fought their way off the beaches.|`|LPsmRI5Oaa	Shear manpower. Wave after wave of men and equipment. Ask anyone who was there.

Iz4hQXXRaa	Wicked! it's the best broadway play ever! (if you've read the book, don't let that discourage you; the play is way better)|`|dqrT2m9uaa	If you want the old-fashioned type Broadway, go to Gypsy. Then, you can see Patti LuPone... legend.<br>  If you want a more modern show, go to In The Heights. It's rap and musical theatre all in one. However, it has lots of Spanish, so if you're not fluent or learning, it could be hard to understand.<br>  Wicked is always a good standby. I saw it on tour and thought it was amazing. <br>  Another favourite of mine is Avenue Q. It's a little... interesting and out there, so I recommend knowing the plotline before hand.<br>  West Side Story and South Pacific are good, older shows. <br>  <br>  I'm hoping you enjoy these options!|`|ALpevPl9aa	WICKED! if it is there, then there is absolutely no other option. you HAVE to see it. it is absolutely amazing.

Any other recommendation is simply wrong.|`|ftI1Hny8aa	Do either West Side Story or Avenue Q. They've both won Tony awards and Sondheim is a theater god (him and Patti LuPone). Avenue Q is kind of "out there" though, so it's not the best for everyone. I personally found it hilarious, and one of the writers said there have been elderly women going up to them and saying that they loved it. West Side Story is just plain fantastic. Chicago's really good too, the music and and choreography are amazing and the lyrics are clever. IMO Wicked's not as good as everyone makes it out to be. The plot was okay and the effects were good, but I started getting sick of all the forced Wizard of Oz jokes, cheap rhymes and made-up words by Act 2.<br>  <br>  Wow that was pretty long, sorry.

Based on English and French passivity, he sent troops into the demilitarized French controlled Rhineland with the order to withdraw at the sight of any opposition. France offered no such opposition, and Hitler knew that he would have free reign of Europe for the immediate future. In that same year, he supported the Fascist regime in the Spanish Civil War, led by Francisco Franco. This was mutually beneficial, as it gave Franco's regime the edge over the Communists that they needed, and gave Hitler the opportunity to test out his new weapons and strategies. This proved to be extremely successful, and convinced Hitler that he was ready to meet military opposition.<br>  His initial goal, at least the one that he announced to the world, was to unite the German speaking people of the world.

Personally, I find it funny when Lysander wakes up and professes his "love" for Helena. <br>  <br>  With Puck and Bottom the humor takes place when Puck puts the "***"/donkey head on Bottom. Not only does it say something about Bottom's personality, but the way the lines he's given after he's been transformed are quite funny.

nJ0MRH24aa	All major battles are linked to patriotism in that they are about someone trying to defend his home/family/country. The battles that come to mind are those lost by the defenders against great odds after a prolonged fight involving great heroism by the defenders. This heroism comes at a time when their country need it for propaganda, and it gets exagerated. Which battle that would be depends on where you are from. Consider:<br>  <br>  Texas: The Alamo. Recall the bit about Coronel Trevor drawing a line in the sand and offering to let anyone leave who wanted to go.<br>  <br>  Mexico: The defense of El Castillo de Chapultepec. Recall the ninos heroes. <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%B1os_H%C3%A9roes" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni%C3%B1os_...</a><br>  <br>  Britain: The Battle of the Imjin River. If you recall this battle at all, no comment is needed.<br>  <br>  USA: The Battle of Midway. This is a little different in that the USA prevailed against the odds. However, the attack on the Japanese fleet by small squadrons of dive bombers, many without bombs, but only to draw fire was amazing.<br>  <br>  Japan: Iwo Jima. The island was defended against impossible odds with no hope of relief, escape, nor victory to nearly the last man. The reason is that Japan was suffering fire bombing, and allowing the island to fall into American hands would result in its conversion into an air base that would greatly increase the rate of fire bombing in Japan. It was critical for the Japanese to stall for time there.<br>  <br>  Ukrane: Stalengrad. This was the bloodiest battle of WW2. Men fought through the city house by house. Again, this is unusual in that the USSR won that battle, but it has become the great patriotic battle.<br>  <br>  Australia: Seige of Tobruk. The Australians held this important real estate against incredible odds for 5 months.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tobruk" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_To...</a>|`|KHSOVxViaa	How about the First Battle of Thermopylae?<br>  <br>  This is the famous battle where a relatively small force of Greeks from different city states, but notably Sparta, held off a much larger army of invading Persians, allowing time for a larger army to be mobilised.<br>  <br>  The Persians had been regarded as fairly unstoppable before this, steadily expanding their empire westwards.  The Greek lands were next in their sights.<br>  <br>  While the city states frequently argued and fought with each other, they came together when faced with a common foe.  The Spartan King Leonidas led a force of 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans and an unknown number of auxiliaries to the narrow pass at Thermopylae, the only route into Greece.<br>  <br>  They fought off the Persians for several days, inflicting disproportionate losses, but the rearguard were eventually eliminated and the Persians poured in.  However, they had received such a bloody nose that their operations in Greece were limited, and they were unable to breach the defences at Corinth which the Greeks had had time to reinforce.<br>  <br>  A Greek (mainly Athenian) navy defeated the Persians at the Battle of Salamis, preventing them having the naval ability to reinforce and attack where they wanted.  The Persians withdrew much of their battered force, leaving behind the least demoralised troops to finish the job.  However the Greeks by this time had mobilised a large army, and defeated the Persian force decisively at Plataea.  The westwards Persian expansion had been checked for good.<br>  <br>  All because a bunch of quarrelling Greeks looked beyond their differences and fought to the death for their homeland.
i5FP4Vbraa	If I remember rightly, the press thought that Winston would easily win.  It actually came as a really big shock and surprise the next day to find Labour had won the 1945 election with a massive landslide victory.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/2049.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/204...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/26/newsid_3572000/3572175.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates...</a><br>  <br>  I remember a broadcast by the BBC made somtime back in the 1960s of a retired senior civil servant who had gone into the cabinet room at No.10 to find the Labour cabinet of 1945 all seated in total silence.  This was on day one of them being in government [1945].  The PM, Clem Atlee asked this civil servant, "what do we do now"?  The Civil servant then explained that they, the government simply issued instructions to the civil service and these instructions would be carried out etc.<br>  <br>  Right, let's do it then.  And by 1947 the new NHS was in place and up and running.<br>  <br>  Quite amazing really.|`|AA11304025	This was the first election since 1935 and people remembered the mess the Conservative party made of domestic and foreign affairs before the war.|`|shVgCizBaa	United Kingdom general election, 1945<br>  The United Kingdom General Election of 1945 was a general election held on 5 July 1945, with delayed polls taking place on 12 July and in Nelson and Colne on 19 July. It was ultimately counted and declared on 26 July, due in part to the time it took to transport the votes of those serving overseas.<br>  A khaki election held just months after VE Day, it was the first general election to be held since 1935, as general elections had been suspended until the Allied victory in the Second World War had been assured. It resulted in the shock election defeat of the Conservatives led by Winston Churchill and the landslide victory of the Labour Party led by Clement Attlee, who won a majority of 145 seats.<br>  <br>  The result of the election came as a major shock to the Conservatives,[1] given the heroic status of Winston Churchill, but reflected the voters' belief that the Labour Party were better able to rebuild the country following the war than the Conservatives.[2] Churchill and the Conservatives are also generally considered to have run a poor campaign in comparison to Labour; Churchill's statement that Attlee's programme would require a Gestapo-esque body to implement is considered to have been particularly poorly judged.[3] Equally, whilst voters respected and liked Churchill's wartime record, they were more distrustful of the Conservative Party's domestic and foreign policy record in the late thirties. Labour had also been given, during the war, the opportunity to display to the electorate their domestic competence in government under men such as Attlee, Herbert Morrison and Ernest Bevin at the Ministry of Labour.<br>  <br>  The Labour Party ran on promises to create full employment, a tax funded universal National Health Service, and a cradle-to-grave welfare state, with the campaign message 'Let us face the future.'<br>  <br>  This was the first election in which Labour gained a majority of seats, and also the first time it won a plurality of votes. If it had won another 68,767 or 0.3% of votes it would have had over 50% of all those cast: the closest any party has come a majority of all votes since 1931<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_King...</a>    .----------------------------<br>  1945 General Election                                                         The 1945 British General Election was held in the aftermath of the Allied victory in Europe and the result was a huge shock to wartime leader, Winston Churchill. For this general election, the Conservatives, led by Churchill, had played on his inspirational wartime leadership skills – the man who had taken the country through the threat of defeat and invasion, heavy bombing and ultimately to victory. Winston Churchill had world-wide fame and respect. The Conservative's major opponent, the Labour Party, was led by Clement Atlee – reasonably well known in this country but not outside of it. <br>  The war in Europe ended in May 1945. Churchill wanted the wartime coalition government extended until Japan was defeated. Atlee wanted a fresh start with a new party-based government in power.  The election date was set for July 5th 1945 and campaigning started on June 4th. The result was not known until July 26th as there were many servicemen stationed abroad who had the right to vote but the sheer logistics of getting their results back to London held everything up. <br>   Labour got 393 seats in Parliament, the Conservatives 208 seats and the Liberals 12 seats. Therefore, the Labour Party had a majority of 173 over both opposition parties. By any standards, this was an overwhelming electoral victory for Labour – and a severe defeat for the Conservatives.  <br>  Why was Churchill rejected after his wartime leadership? Why were the Conservatives so badly defeated? <br>   <br>  Many people believe that the election campaign for a post-war government actually started in 1942 with the publication of the Beveridge Report. The Labour Party was very much associated with the report with its slogan "Freedom From Want". The Conservatives were less associated with the report and by 1945 were still associated with those who did well out of society. The chronic social ills of Britain in the 1930’s had been put to one side as the country pulled together during the war with one common enemy. Towards the end of the war and immediately after it, these social ills took political precedence again.  <br>  "I remember very well indeed the numbers of men home on leave who came on to (the election) platforms in their uniforms, quite against regulations, who were saying they did not want to resume civilian life under the conditions they had had before they went into the services. There’s no doubt about this impact of life in the 30’s upon these young men."  <br>   <br>  Lord Robens speaking in 1970. He was elected as a Labour MP in 1945.<br>   The failure of Churchill had also been linked to his approach to the Labour Party during the campaign. Churchill unfavourably compared the Labou|`|tFfUMQtyaa	DUH!!!! MORE people voted for the Labour party, Therefore they won!!!!

shVgCizBaa	Who dreaded the change upon hearing of President Lincoln’s death and the rise of Andrew Johnson as president?Abraham Lincoln  has since consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest U.S. Presidents.Andrew Johnson   is consistently ranked by historians as being among the worst U.S. presidents -------------- Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th President of the United States. He successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis, the American Civil War, preserving the Union and ending slavery. As the war was drawing to a close, Lincoln became the first American president to be assassinated. Before his election in 1860 as the first Republican president, Lincoln had been a lawyer, an Illinois state legislator, a member of the United States House of Representatives, and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the U.S. Senate.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lin...</a>                                                    Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 – July 31, 1875) was the 17th President of the United States (1865–69), succeeding to the Presidency upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. He was the first U.S. President to be impeached.<br>  <br>  At the time of the secession of the Southern states, Johnson was a U.S. Senator from Greeneville in eastern Tennessee. As a Unionist, he was the only southern Senator not to quit his post upon secession. He became the most prominent War Democrat from the South and supported the military policies of US President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War of 1861–1865. In 1862 Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee, where he proved to be energetic and effective in fighting the rebellion and beginning transition to Reconstruction.[2]<br>  <br>  Johnson was nominated for the Vice President slot in 1864 on the National Union Party ticket. He and Lincoln were elected in November 1864. Johnson succeeded to the Presidency upon Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865.<br>  <br>  As president he took charge of Presidential Reconstruction – the first phase of Reconstruction – which lasted until the Radical Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. His conciliatory policies towards the South, his hurry to reincorporate the former Confederates back into the union, and his vetoes of civil rights bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with some Republicans.[3] The Radicals in the House of Representatives impeached him in 1868 while charging him with violating the Tenure of Office Act, a law enacted by Congress in March 1867 over Johnson's veto, but he was acquitted by a single vote in the Senate.<br>  <br>  He is the most recent President to represent a party other than the Republican or Democratic parties, having represented both the Democrats and the National Union Party. He is consistently ranked by historians as being among the worst U.S. presidents. Today, historians generally regard Johnson as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history.[34][35] Eric Foner called him a "fervent white supremacist" who foiled Reconstruction.[36] Sean Wilentz wrote that he "actively sided with former Confederates" in his attempts to derail it.[34] This has been a modern trend of dis-esteem, primarily as the Reconstruction program itself has come to be seen as a "noble" effort to build an interracial nation.[35][36]However, it should be noted that W. E. B. Du Bois, had proposed this view in his pioneering study, Black Reconstruction first published in 1935 (to which Foner and other recent historians are heir).<br>  <br>  The Dunning School of the early 20th century saw Johnson as a heroic bulwark against the corruption of the Radical Republicans who tried to remove the entire leadership class of the white South. In their view, Johnson seemed to be the legitimate heir of the sainted Abraham Lincoln.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  By the 1930s a series of favorable biographies enhanced his prestige.[37] Johnson's Republican critics of the 1860s appeared as disreputable to liberal historians as did the Republican critics of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Furthermore, a Beardian School (named after Charles Beard and typified by Howard K. Beale) argued that the Republican Party in the 1860s was a tool of corrupt business interests, and that Johnson stood for the people. They rated Johnson "near great," but have later changed their minds, rating Johnson "a flat failure".[36] The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s brought a new perspective to the practice of history as well as to civil legislation. Historians noted African American efforts to establish public education and welfare institutions, gave muted praise for Republican efforts to extend suffrage and provide other social institutions, and excoriated Johnson for siding with the opposition to extending basic rights to former slaves.[36]<br>  Johnson's purchase of Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867 is believed to be his most important foreign policy action, with the purchase proving it

q33FiROraa	It's difficult to put simply and I'd advise you to look it up but the basics are that it is referring to a period in the 18th century approx. 1700 - 1745.<br>  The Augustan term refers to the fact that the writers of this age found parallels in writing styles and subject matter to the writers of the Roman empire under Augustus...writers like Ovid and Virgil. <br>  <br>  The subject matter of writers of Augustine literature was 'new' and included political satire and criticism. It was written with wit and sarcasm and the tone was different to what people were used to.<br>  <br>  Writers such as Pope, Dryden,Swift and Defoe were important writers of this era. <br>  <br>  Gullivers Travels is a good example of  Augustan literature - it was a novel (not yet a popular form of writing at the time) that appeared to be a childrens story/fantasy book but it was really a social satire.<br>  <br>  This is incredibly simplified - really would advise you to look it up!
iIFXY9jHaa	Well to start it is really hard to pick up dancing at that age i say you should take ballet because it is the building block to all dance you may want to take some private lessons because what the kids are doing in class may be hard for you to catch up to you may also start in a mot as known place because the more known the harder it can be but after a year of ballet start taking other classes like jazz(it does have some hip hop thought most schools have hip hop as another class) but i must say any dance requires a big commitment|`|mb1CZfuEaa	prolly jazz would be good its not that hard and doesnt take a big commitment like Ballet|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i started around 13, but i started with everything and anything. All the people around me used to know how to dance, now im older and in a different environment and dancing isn't a big deal any more. Id say start out with some of the latest dances and youtube. You can practice any dance you want if you just youtube and go from there. It takes a lot of practice, but its fun.|`|AA10335589	usually high school folklorico is not such  major commintment and is easy and good excersise give it a try!<br>  good luck! ;)|`|dnMvibooaa	jazz would be good since youve never danced before. compared to other forms, jazz is less structured and i think youd have a lot of fun with it.|`|maEk3Ui1aa	hip hop all the way<br>  and it's really good<br>  but it's your decision<br>  i love dance tooo|`|vEVtXftTaa	Hip hop classes are a blast.  That's what I suggest.|`|UediSxFbaa	If you want to develop a technical background go for Ballet and then move onto others, otherwise if you just wanna have some fun and do someting upbeat do jazz.|`|V2v66A7Waa	jazz is probably the best (: Its fun but its not as strict as ballet. Also how about tap? thats also fun! <br>  i hope you really go into dance because its so much fun!<br>  good luck

kfOpbbCyaa	No, there were only three movies/miniseries made - thus the name trilogy. :)<br>  <br>  Actually, I didn't think Patrick Swayze made an appearance in the third. See <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000664/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000664/</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_and_South_(TV_miniseries)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_and_S...</a>|`|KDigMCfZaa	That was a good trilogy. I don't know if they've made or plan on making movies of these, but Mr. Jakes wrote a couple other Civil War novels: On Secret Service, Charleston, and I think there's another but I can't remember the title right now.
ZB9zkbxxaa	Francisco Madero, Pancho Villa, Pascual Orozco, and Emiliano Zapata amassed supporters, and in 1911 Madero was declared president, but his slow-paced reforms alienated both former allies and foes. He was deposed by Gen. Victoriano Huerta, whose own drunken and despotic dictatorship quickly fell to Villa, Venustiano Carranza, and álvaro Obregón. Carranza declared himself president in 1914 over Villa's objections and, after further bloodshed, prevailed. He oversaw the writing of the liberal constitution of 1917 but did little to implement its key provisions; in 1920 he was killed while fleeing a rebellion. With the election of the reform-minded Obregón, the revolutionary period ended, though sporadic clashes continued until Lázaro Cárdenas took office in 1934.

uRCbwSIlaa	You're definately talented that's for sure. ;)<br>  However, the best art pieces reach out to people of all sorts in different ways. Art means more when it touches the viewer, calling upon any personal experience they have so that they can connect with the piece. <br>  <br>  I think a lot of the problem lies in where your inspiration for drawing comes from. Is it just a doodle that looks like a cool image in your head? Or is it brought forth by strong emotions, real problems and thoughts? <br>  <br>  The easiest way to begin incorporating these things into your work is to choose a problem, dilemma, situation or emotion that is universal and using THAT as the focal point of your art. Themes that everyone can relate to include death, love, family, moments of happiness, etc, etc. And the symbols that represent them, not just obvious ones such as a heart or skull. But rather color and placement of objects. Think about everything you do. Color, texture, Line- all the elements and principles of art evoke a different feeling from each person viewing. Make sure you have a clear understanding of what your message is, and choose the elements that best illustrate that. <br>  <br>  The more personal and expressive a piece of work is, the more it will inspire and have meaning. <br>  <br>  Sorry, it's long.  Hope it helped! :D|`|AA11239863	You need to make them mean something to you first... If your art is just a drawing with no emotion then it is a computer image... what is memorable and unique is what means more to you... you understand... and once your passion comes out... your art will speak and you will speak for it... <br>  I also was in AP art... Im not the best artist... but to me my art was a 120 out of 10... because it meant more to me than a grade... Believe me it will show...|`|fKco44yxaa	hmm it seems a little dull...<br>  <br>  Try framing things better? Ever heard of the rule of thirds? google it, it might help - adds a level of human appreciation<br>  <br>  Its a good picture...it just doesn't really have any flavour|`|3eI0vYHgaa	IDK, I looked at some of the other pics of yours and I think they're pretty cool. I don't know what to do to make them more appealing, tho. Sorry, dude.|`|amcqJkWhaa	Well it seems you got some good answers so far.<br>  To draw what has meaning to you, so that your intensity and feelings about the subject somehow shines in your art. <br>  Maybe you can just try to draw well, instead of worrying about styles. You can always improve your art by trying to draw well.... so it is appealing in the way it looks with some drawing skill behind it. <br>  But it seems, perhaps you just have to love what you do... maybe you're not fully being joyful when you draw. So, instead of trying to make things more meaningful to others, you could try to make drawing more valuable to YOU... I think the only reason why people draw and make art is because they like to be alive, and to create, so if love shines through your art, I think it'll brighten up people's days, even if what you draw isn't very clever or very... different. <br>  Look at the works of Frank Frazetta... his drawings are like women, war, gore, and muscly men, but yet, he seems to embrace all aspects of life, and so he's pretty popular. He has a vitality in his drawings, like he loves life, like he affirms life, so that... is pretty inspirational in itself. Nowadays, the feeling of love for life has become buried under rules and such like that, like it doesn't feel alright to live. We have to worry about our carbon footprints and what our ancestors did, and have to make up for it, because those poor folk in the past were so rudely treated. No mind about LIVING, and living in the present at that, making the best of things... nooOOooo... so it's a refresher, if that feeling of life can be found in art... Also Frazetta made lots of money I guess. <br>  I know that that's not so very romantic, that perhaps you want to draw art that touch people, and inspires feelings, but, well, it's a matter of taste, too. Everybody has individual taste. And if you like what you do, because that value has much value to you, then to you, your art will be valuable, and to you, it won't seem like a waste of time, and I think that's the biggest part in all this. <br>  I wonder if this quote will have significance here... <br>  'Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it.' ~ C.S Lewis<br>  <br>  The point is not to find a purpose in things, the point is to feel better about it. Because if you logically try to deduce things, it takes all the fun out of everything. It's like, if you go on vacation, you go to have fun and to have insights, not to get thing's done, so if you were to logically figure it out, you'll cause yourself more trouble if you go exploring, so you might as well stay where you are. But, that's not much of a vacation, right? <br>  <br>  And, you're always going to offend SOMEBODY with the things you do, so trying to appeal to everyone, well... can't really do that, likely. What's the point of art if it's to be inoffensive? It wouldn't be very realistic then right? <br>  <br>  Oh and, you might want to look up some books on Disney animation, because in some of the books there are many interesting thoughts on 'appeal', design appeal, gag appeal, stuff like that. The books by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, old time animators, are especially good resources, and I recommend the Illusion of Life. I believe 'appeal' is one of their 12 principles they listed.
cvvJGahOaa	you should do your diorama on the fight scene with James. It would look really cool if you made the dance studio and then placed bella, james and edward in. You could also do the scene when they are in the woods and edward shows himself to bella in the sunlight. <br>  Let me know if that helps!|`|w3yrnDEiaa	You should do your diarama about the novel Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones. You could do the castle with Howl Sophie and Markl standing on it. That story would make a great project.<br>  <br>  It's 'school' not 'skwl'
wUq7oinGaa	Actually it wasn't a Greek empire.  It was Macedonian, which was directly north of the Greeks.  Alexander the Great conquered Greece, Turkey, Palestine, Egypt, Persia, and the Punjab region of India.  After his death it was split between the most powerful of his Generals: Antigonus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy.  Antigonus got Macedonia and Greece, Ptolemy got Egypt, and for a time Palestine, and Seleucus got Turkey and Persia.  India returned to governing itself.

iqyNCVwIaa	Since this is in the photography section I'm wondering if you mean film as in movies or film as in photography but either way if you're completely sure this is what you want to do with your life...go to art school and major in it! There are so many great ones...RISD, SVA, FIT, PRATT, SCAD, UARTS...just visit as many websites as you can and if it sounds like somewhere you might like go take a tour!

F5GyrdQfaa	Also, the middle ages, once known as the Dark Ages for the noticeable decline in living standards, was a time in between two comparable civilizations. While the Romans didn't have electronics or mass-production, they did possess running water, sewers, high literacy rates, something resembling our 'rule of law', and organized bureaucracies.<br>    This contrasts sharply to the middle ages, when rule reverted back to 'strong-man' monarchs and tyrants. During this time cities were often dirty, water unclean, and the 'rule of law' consisted of the men with the shiny swords demanding your money. Also there was increased superstition, the selling of 'holy relics', and a decline in the commoners education (i.e. none). Pretty much all of Europe would have resembled the Appalachians. <br>    What we now know of as medieval is more consistent with the time between 1100 and 1400 AD, just before the Renaissance. Here the various Warlords were consolidated by fuedalism into Kings and Vassal states, and the modern nations of Europe began to solidify. In contrast to the prior 600 years, it was an exciting time of increased greatness for Europe that, sadly, would not have happened except for the Crusades, which allowed the Europeans to come into contact with the Middle East, where ancient knowledges had been preserved.|`|5i8rabuAaa	Still stalking your gym teacher?

Donald's origin was as a Scottish clan name. It didn't go far beyond Scotland until the great migrations in the 1700's to the new world. So, unless he is in Scotland in 1500, he probably wouldn't have been a Donald, and even then only rarely as a first name. Miles is equally modern. It has older roots is the Germanic Milo and Nordic Milu, but the modern spelling of Miles didn't really come about until the 1700's.<br>  Were there many black men becoming their own merchants in Europe in the 1500's? save for Spain, Europe was pretty white. Where? What names did that area use? Is he coming out of Africa? If so, he'd probably have a more African name. There aren't many Egyptian Berry's running around (did you mean Barry).<br>  <br>  It seems you need to first decide where this happens (or at least where he was born) and then research names common to that specific area at the time.<br>  <br>  One concern with a "period" piece is that you lose some flexibility with some things, like names. You can't just use a name that you like just because you like it. You need to pick a name that fits the time or the piece, even a comedy piece, can lose credibility and believability.

3ZFUl8Ygaa	You've read Twilight, and if you're big into vampires there are lots of, let's face it, truly terrible books concerning them. Some vampires books that are actually good might be "Vampire Diaries" or the "Night World Trilogy", both by L.J. Smith. "The Morganville Vampires" series by Rachel Caine is a  bit more explicit, and you might want to check with your parents before reading the "Vampire Academy" series by Richelle Mead, but those two books are really good!<br>  <br>  If mystery books are what you're craving, try :The Face on the Milk Carton" by Caroline B. Cooney, "The Invention of Hugo Cabret: by Brian Selzneck, or "Password: Murder" by Norah McClintok. Similarily, the "Harry Potter" books by J.K. Rowling are suspenseful and much better then the movies (in my opinion) and "The Summoning" by Kelly Armstrong has it, too.<br>  <br>  Two amazing books set in the Victorian ages are "A Great and Terrible Beauty" by Libba Bray and "Catherine, Called Birdy" by Karen Cushman. A separate historical novel about Canadian/ American history is "The Youngest Spy" by Barry McDivitt, which, despite it's boring cover, is actually really good.<br>  <br>  Would you like to check out some mythical books? If so try "Wicked Lovely" by Melissa Marr, or "Love is Hell" by a collaboration of authors. Fabulous books set in mace-up kingdoms are " The Goose Girl" by Shannon Hale and "The Swan Kingdom" by Zoe Marriott. Two peaceful books about death are "Ghost Child" by Eve Bunting and the must-read "The Five People You Meet in Heaven", written by Mitch Alborn. If you only read two books I give you please let them be "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins and "Uglies" by Scott Westerfeld, because they are just simply the best. Books. I've. Ever. Read.<br>  <br>  If you like animal books, the "Warriors" series by Erin Hunter or "The Tale of Despereaux" by Kate DiCamillo would be suffice. "I'd Tell You That I Love You But Then I'd Have To Kill You" by Ally Carter is not about animals but rather spys, and is quite good.<br>  <br>  More realistic books about teenage girls what you looking for? "Just Listen" by Sara Dessen, "Guitar Girl" by Sarra Manning, "Stargirl" by Jerry Spinelli, "Fame, Glory, and Other Things On My To-Do List" by Janette Rallison, "It's a Mall World After All" by Janette Rallison, "The Clique" by Lisi Harrison, "The Confessions of Georgia Nicholson" series by Louise Rennison and "One of Those Hideous Books Where the Mother Dies" by Sonia Sones are only a few. Add "Perfect" by Natasha Friend to the mix and voila!

I'm sure she kept notes as she had many drafts for each book.

Don't go into too much detail. Just give a basic outline of the movie.<br>  Secondly, you'd answer questions about whether you liked the movie or not, what you liked/disliked about it, how you felt about the quality of the acting, the setting, action, etc. Just state your opinion, but don't waver on how you feel. State clearly whether you liked it or not. Otherwise, you're readers will not be interested in reading your review.<br>  I think this covers it, but if you need anymore help just ask.

This was a 4 book series, but they condensed it into 2 and republished it)<br>  <br>  The House of Night series-P.C Cast + Kristen Cast. EXTREMELY GOOD!!!! It gets better each book!! First book: Marked. This has alot of cussing and dirty talk, so only read this if you are very mature.<br>  <br>  Uglies series- Scott Westerfeld. An amazing sci fi. Truly amazing. First book: Uglies.<br>  <br>  Midnighters-Scott Westerfeld. I didn't really think it would be good, but I was out of books for the moment so I checked it out, and it was really good! Better than I thought. Scott Westerfeld is an awsome writer.<br>  <br>  Maximum Ride-James Patterson. Really good!!! Prepare to soar, literally! First book: Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment.<br>  <br>  Skinned- Robin Wasserman. Another cool sci fi. <br>  <br>  Warriors series-Erin Hunter. If you are a cat lover, or enjoy animal stories, then you would probably like this one. There are three separate series in this, so be sure to get the very first one. It is Into the Wild.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Most of these are becoming movies, too! You should also just browse Barnes & Nobles, too.

TAIlyvgyaa	Change the placement of 'home' and 'house' in the first line, making the sale of 'house' and the keeping of the 'home' have more impact.<br>  <br>  'would be sure to be' is clumsy, change it to 'would surely be' or 'surely would be' .<br>  <br>  Change 'to move where' to 'to move to where'.<br>  <br>  'Sarah refuses to give in' is better and change 'to be submissive to the idea' to 'to submit to the idea'.|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	You have a good start. I'm guessing its for a novel or shorty story???<br>  <br>  I would suggest adding more descriptive words and just more description to the paragraph in general.<br>  <br>  Example: Sarah refuses to sell her family home because it would be like selling a family heirloom or a treasured piece of jewelry. Sarah's home is not just a house, it is where she and her husband raised their children. It represents love, loyalty and family. Special memories are burrowed inside. It would be heart breaking for anybody to have to pack away those kinds of memories. Despite her husband's attempts to convince her to move where he believe they will be more comfortable and enjoy life more, Sarah continues to refuse to give in. Even the attempts of her children to get her to be submissive to the idea fails.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and best wishes with your story!|`|qgs155HNaa	Sarah was desolate.  Her home was her collection of her memories, of her life's associations, of her time with her loving husband and children.  She could not just surrender it,  pack things away, and move. Anyone's heart would break at such a complete surrender of everything meaningful.  Oh, her husband tried to persuade her that a new home would be more comfortable and enjoyable,  but Sarah could not accept such cold reasoning.  Even her children could not persuade her.<br>  <br>  Still amateurish, I'm afraid, but it's more personal.  Try to think as Sarah would.|`|QBNRbODBaa	I don't know what you mean about making it more appealing.

To move away would be heart breaking for anyone with such a strong sentimental attachment. Despite the attempts of her husband and children, Sarah still refuses.|`|eG0Rhqv3aa	Sarah refuses to sell her home because for her, the house represents a collection of memories and associations of her life there with her husband and children. To sell the house, pack things away, and move would break their hearts. Despite her husband's attempts to convince her otherwise, believing they will be more comfortable and enjoy life more elsewhere, Sarah stubbornly refuses, determined not to sell the house; even when her children try to pursuay her, she still refuses to sell their house.<br>  <br>  Is this okay? :)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!!! :)|`|y4vUsDPsaa	sarah refuses to sell her home. the house was a collection of memory's. her life, her husband, her children. how could anybody let that go? no one can convince her, not even her children. <br>  <br>  its shorter though|`|ghbaAWOCaa	The thought of selling her house triggers a certain sense of poignancy within sarah. It is no longer just a building as t had once seemed to her; a simple glare at it evokes the many memories it has lived through, sentiments all wrapped up within it. She holds it to her heart tightly affixed to its place its place-just where its meant to be. Her husband and children touching mention on the issue of selling it seems infuriatingly hurtful as it releases form within her an inklng of resentment that she cannot get herself to submit to her childrens protests of selling.

Sarah refuses to move despite her husband's attempts to convince her they will be more comfortable elsewhere. Even her children’s attempts have failed to persuade her to consider the idea.
YzUQMXJ0aa	You're Queen of the Fairies. You are AWESOME!!!<br>  This is Shakespeare. Don't be afraid to be dramatic. Forget your shyness and focus on the character you are playing. You can have some fun with this (after all, it is a comedy), so forget your regular life and have fun getting caught up in the wonderful world of Shakespeare! Be sure to deliver all of your lines with confidence, even if you are nervous. You'll become more comfortable and you'll feel empowered.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I love that play.

3ud5O9SXaa	Bit tricky - which Battle of Ypres, as there were three ?  You could curse the British commanders like 'Butcher' Haig for putting you in the trenches to be slaughtered, where soldiers feet rotted, though more soldiers got STDs then foot rot ! Maybe you could write about the famous Christmas truce when the troops played soccer together and shared gifts till the C.O.s found out - "you can't have a war if you make friends with the enemy !!!"
AA10303012	Not at all.  First, many of the colonist thought of themselves as Loyalists, loyal to the king.  Second, even those who favored the revolution and were called Patriots, did not imagine themselves as fighting for their independence from Britain, at least at the start of the war.  At the start of the war, all they wanted from England was  a renegotiated place within the kingdom, one which allowed them representation in Parliament.<br>  <br>  At the start of the war, all of the colonists still considered themselves British subjects, it wasnt until the war was well underway that they began to talk of independence.

The first answerer is right but so are uou with the video games and pizza...its basically what I did all through High School. Just let him laugh it off and go on....but it keeps coming back, or he has the dream multiple times. Its cool for him to think about it just don't let it "bother" him or scare him.<br>  <br>  But you are right that most guys, masculine ones anyway, wouldn't stress over a dream at all. It might bug him in the back of his mind but he wouldn't let it ruin his day or anything. If it really bothers him...he may talk to somebody but you gotta be careful because its rare and starts to sound feminine when guys talk about "scary dreams". He could be convinced to tell his girlfriend, like she could notice he acts distracted and ask him to tell her. With a girlfriend is a way a guy can be feminine acting and it not count because guys act differently around their girls.   Just don't let him cry or loose sleep over it....very feminine. Its just a dream.<br>  <br>  Don't know enough about the characters or storyline to suggest things to keep the story from dragging...|`|lDGG6Jvoaa	Guys talk about sex and play war games and sneak beers from cupboards lol.

W1h3w5gdaa	Wow, now THAT is a doozy of a question. Punk is basically the antithesis of formal guitar instruction. It's a genre of music that gets its sound specifically from players who don't "know how" to play guitar. (I put that in quotes because I don't really believe in a "right" or "wrong" way to play any instrument.)<br>  <br>  I can kind of give you an online lesson right now, actually. <br>  <br>  1) Pick an open-chord shape (most likely E or A.) <br>  <br>  2) Move it up a fret and barre.  <br>  <br>  3) Slam down on the guitar strings repeatedly.<br>  <br>  4) Move your hand to another position on the fretboard.<br>  <br>  5) Return to step 3.<br>  <br>  And I'm only being half-facetious here. The idea behind punk is to "buck the system." Guitar lessons, by nature, are instruction on a system. <br>  <br>  And I'm not knocking them; I make my living teaching guitar.  I also love punk rock. All I'm saying is that anything that claims to be "teaching punk guitar" is really kind of a paradox.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to listen to a lot of punk and try to imitate it. Listen to the classics, like the Sex Pistols and the Clash, Ramones, stuff like that. (God help me, not this new pseudo-punk crap that is actually emo pop.)<br>  <br>  Rock on dude!!

B0GujA9Aaa	Rubym's post is great. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Here's my two cents worth. <br>  <br>  Flappers were a symbol of the changing attitudes of what was socially acceptable. <br>  <br>  Women were give more freedom to be social amongst the male dominated society. They could dress lightly, smoke, drink, cuss, drive cars and do what the guys were doing (socially).|`|gW0nD5cEaa	They represented a freedom for women, though in later times they would have been seen as sexist (I don't know the right term, women who men would think of as sex objects), but they were more liberal and less moral than previous generations of women. In later years, they may not have seemed like real pioneers for women's rights, but they were in some ways. But most were just trying to have fun, not make political statements. And until then, women tended to be at home until they married, and almost always married the man their parents approved of. Now women were getting out and dating different men. Unlike the 60';s and later, marriage was still the main goal, but they might have had more to choose from. <br>  <br>  Times were changing, women were getting the right to vote, they were wearing shorter dresses, not a big deal now, but a very big deal then; even wearing their hair short was a big deal to the older generations. I think the 20's generation and the 60's may have had more in common when it comes to rebellion than the 40's and 50's. <br>  <br>  I don't know if that's 3 things, but things in general were just more liberal with jazz, prohibition bringing 'speak easys' and 'bathtub gin', etc. men and women both were just more liberal and maybe immoral or amoral.<br>  <br>  Thanks Chedvah|`|shVgCizBaa	Roaring Twenties  <br>  The 1920s in the United States, called “roaring” because of the exuberant, freewheeling popular culture of the decade. The Roaring Twenties was a time when many people defied Prohibition, indulged in new styles of dancing and dressing, and rejected many traditional moral standards.flappers  A nickname given to young women in the 1920s who defied convention by refusing to use corsets, cutting their hair short, and wearing short skirts, as well as by behavior such as drinking and smoking in public.Flappers in the 1920's <br>  Kacey Davis<br>  Mr. Finley<br>  US History Project<br>   <br>  Flappers in the 1920’s we defined by their short hair, short skirts, turned down hose with powdered knees, who often offended the older generation. The Flappers were women of the Jazz age, who were very rebellious to their parents and other authority figures. They looked as other women had never looked before, with boyish figures; short, dyed and weaved bobs instead of the traditional long hair usually worn by women of the time. The clothing also was very different from the usual attire adorned by women, instead of being fitted at the waist and being curvy at the hips and bust, the dresses were straight and slim, usually covered in beads and fringes. <br>  <br>  Young women of the 1920’s who were caught up in the Flapper era stopped obeying the “rules” of society, and created their own. Driving their own cars, drinking, and petting with people they weren't’t married to, became common practice.<br>  <br>  When people talk about the Flapper generation, usually the name Clara Bow comes up in the conversation. Also known as “The It Girl” by many, Clara Bow was the cross between America’s Sweetheart and The Vamp. Clara was the first actress who openly flaunted her sex appeal; she was very open and carefree. In a comparison, Clara could be called the Marilyn Monroe of the 1920’s. Many future actress and sex symbols idolized Clara Bow; some of them include Louise Brooks in the 1920’s, Marilyn Monroe in the 1950’s and Madonna in the 1980’s. Her confidence and open sexuality attracted many people. However, life was not all fun and games for her, she grew up in poverty, depression and abuse, and rose above it all to become the success she was. Even though she was so famous and idolized, in the end she went back to being alone and ended up dieting by herself like the way she always danced.<br>  "All the time the flapper is laughin' and dancin', there's a feelin' of tragedy underneath..." ~Clara Bow<br>  <br>  The Flappers were important to the 1920's because they defined for the first time women and their independence breaking the "rules" of the common society where women were looked down upon. They set the pace for women of the future and made it so independence became more accepted and easier to accomplish.<br>   <a href="http://www.msad54.org/sahs/socialstudies/finely/1920s/1920kd/flapper.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.msad54.org/sahs/socialstudies...</a>

Its one of the funniest books i've ever read. It really cant be described to anyone, you have to actually read the book. The reason it cant be explained, is because it is completely random. if i were to tell you about one thing, it wouldn't make sense, unless you read the parts before it, and sometimes even the parts after it. As soon as you think you're starting to get an idea of whats going on, it changes, and the characters are onto some other random "adventure". One of my favorite parts, is something that i had made into a decal, and i have it on my car. it talks about flying. the book specifically states that "Flying is the ability to throw yourself at the ground and miss". basically, it says you just have to throw yourself at the ground, or fall, then somehow completely distract yourself, and make yourself forget about the fact that you're falling. Because if you forget that you're falling you wont be falling anymore, and you'll have missed the ground and will be flying =D.......confused?...........i figured........lol|`|Rc4Chlw3aa	Harry Potter !

tCZkiYpgaa	The theory is that wolves imprint to carry on the blood line (to produce more wolves). Therefore a wolf will imprint on the person that gives them the best chance of doing that. I think that because Bella was destined to become a vampire (and so wouldn't be able to have children anymore) Jacob could not have imprinted on her. However I'm not sure if that is a link to why it was Renesmee he did imprint on or not - it could have just been a random coinsidence. But this does tell us that Renesmee is human enough to have children.<br>  <br>  That is why Leah believes that Sam did not imprint on her; because she was destined to be a wolf and therefore could not have children.<br>  <br>  Deffinately Jasper Hale!<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful!|`|m3rt9x8Caa	They are soul mates like Bella and Edward are. Imprinting is imprinting at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  Jasper, after Edward.|`|F7ubafH1aa	It's because he's just found 'the one' and it just happened. He didn't have any control over it. And about Bella, no. I always wondered that, but she just wasn't it. And the sexiest..JAMES!! lol. ;)|`|G4iHDhpvaa	Through out the series it says that they believe you imprint to either carry on the line or make you a stronger wolf. I never thought he was going to imprint on Bella and when I found out she was pregnant I knew he would imprint on her kid if it was a girl, I had a feeling. I think he was always meant to be a part of her life in some way.<br>  <br>  Hmmmm... either Emmett <3 Him! <br>  Jasper oh HALE yes!, because everythings bigger in texas :P (random quotes that I have on shirts :P)|`|hfr9rLjkaa	Yeah i agree with the top answer..They always had a connection Jacob and Bella..But its just like it just wasn't meant to be.... That's why he imprinted on her daughter...<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh it has to be Carlise!!! lol wow what a hottie!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The Cullen boys rock! x|`|AA10981338	I guess you could say that Bella and Edward were destined to be together that's why Jacob couldn't imprint on her. <br>  <br>  Jasper, I love Jasper!|`|GZtdISjNaa	Why are leaves green? It wasn't a CHOICE. Why is it that I only have to explain that to the twilight FANS?|`|KvVTmlLWaa	Ok, Bella's "kid" is called Renesmee. So anyway, Jacob's a werewolf, and as explained in New Moon, all werewolves imprint on someone, and it is something that they can't prevent or stop, it just happens. Jacob was around Renesmee alot of the time in the book, so he could help Bella, so he saw Renesmee alot. He imprinted on her when he was about to attack her, then Renesmee looked at him straight in the eye and that's when he imprinted. Sorry for the pretty rubbish explanantion of Imprinting but that's the best I could think of, because it's pretty hard to explain. And as for the best male vampire in Twilight apart from Edward, I'd say Jasper. Don't know why, he seems pretty cool :L x|`|2IMF3okYaa	He imprints on Bella's baby  Reneesme because he like Bella but at the time Edward had liked her so he decided to imprint on the baby<br>  Probably he would have imprinted on Bella only if Edward wasn't going out with her at the time<br>  When Jacob is not on set just regular like him self he looks so hot to me though but Eward looks totally cute<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0Xl4wZpMaa	Because jacob thought hes sould mate was bella. it seemed like that also throught out the whole series its just at the end he realized that he was in love with bellas child. thats all. and i think jacob is the hottest after edward. lol .|`|56nOQvnWaa	Because in the long run Jacob & Renesmee were meant to be together! They are soulmates Bella and Jacob aren't because<br>  Edward and Bella are soulmates. <br>  <br>  and i say Emmett or Jacob.|`|xiIk7p8aaa	Jacob loved Bella as much as he did because she would be the one to carry his imprint. <br>  Probably Jacob or Emmett :)|`|52pZj3WFaa	Haven't read it YET, need to get it, BUT I reckon James.

W1h3w5gdaa	In its simplest form, tab is nothing more than lines and numbers. For a six-string guitar, you'll have six lines.<br>  <br>  As you look at that sheet, the line on the top is string 1, and it moves through in order to the bottom line, string 6. On your guitar, string 1 is the thinnest string, closest to the ground as you hold it. String 6 is the the thickest string, closest to the ceiling.<br>  <br>  The numbers on the lines indicate frets. Frets are the vertical bars that are perpendicular to your strings. As you hold your guitar and look down at it (and assuming you're right-handed) fret 1 is farthest to your left. Moving to the right, the next fret is 2, then 3, 4, 5 and so on, up to 19-24, depending on your guitar.<br>  <br>  So, when you read tab, if you see a 2 written on the top line, that means play string 1, fret 2. A "4" written on the third string from the top would be string 3, fret 4. Make sense?<br>  <br>  Numbers that are listed horizontally are meant to be played sequentially (i.e., one after the other.) Numbers listed vertically are meant to be played simultaneously (i.e., strummed.)<br>  <br>  The X simply means "don't play it" or play it "muted." To mute means to touch the string lightly so that when you play it, you get a percussive sound instead of a note.<br>  <br>  A side note about tab: it's really, really slow and tedious to learn just by reading tab. My advice would be to take some group guitar lessons to get the basics down, get the mechanics efficient, and go from there.<br>  <br>  The key is to eventually learn your pentatonic scales. Once you have those down, tab makes a lot more sense. It becomes intuitive, rather than just memorization, because you'll understand what the artist is doing in the song, rather than just "put-finger-here-play."<br>  <br>  Beyond that, learning the major scale and its modes will expand your tab-reading ability even further.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12253037	<a href="http://guitar.about.com/library/blhowtoreadtab.htm" rel="nofollow">http://guitar.about.com/library/blhowtor...</a>|`|LGJgs1XRaa	yah
rmek0hhjaa	Yes, casting is complete.<br>  <br>  <br>  New Moon by Stephenie Meyer<br>  <br>  newmoon<br>  <br>  "Shoot," I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut.<br>  <br>  It all happened very quickly then.<br>  <br>  Edward threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table...<br>  <br>  I tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. I felt the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow.<br>  <br>  Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm—into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.<br>  <br>  ****<br>  <br>  The Story Behind the Writing of New Moon<br>  <br>  **A note: I don't pull any punches here, so if you haven't read New Moon and you don't want to be spoiled, don't read this.**<br>  <br>  Writing a sequel is a very different experience than writing a story. It was for me, at least.<br>  <br>  If you've read the story behind Twilight, then you know that I didn't set out to write a novel or begin a career as an author. I was just writing down a story for my personal enjoyment, letting it grow as it would and lead where it would. No pressure, just fun.<br>  <br>  The first sequel I wrote to Twilight—Forever Dawn—was more of the same. I wasn't planning a sequel any more than I was planning to write a book in the first place. Originally, Twilight had a more defined ending. But, when it was ended, I started writing epilogues. After I'd written three epilogues, all of them over a hundred pages long, I realized I wasn't ready to stop writing about Bella and Edward. One of those epilogues turned into Forever Dawn.<br>  <br>  (People often ask me if I'm ever going to make Forever Dawn public. The answer is no. For one thing, it's not great—it's downright embarrassing in some places. However, some of the content will work as a loose outline for book four, so I can't tell you what happened, either.)<br>  <br>  I was about three hundred pages into Forever Dawn when my life got turned upside down. Twilight was going to be published. People were going to read what I was writing. More specifically, young adults were going to be reading what I was writing. Unintentionally, I'd written a young adult novel. I realized pretty quickly that Forever Dawn did not follow the rules of YA. Because I was caught up in the story, I finished Forever Dawn anyway, knowing that it would never see the light of day; I gave it to my big sister as a birthday gift. And then I started on the real sequel.<br>  <br>  The biggest non-YA thing I'd done with Forever Dawn was this: I'd pretty much passed over the rest of Bella's high school experience entirely, skipping ahead to a time in her life with more mature themes. So, as I began to sketch out New Moon, I went back to Bella's senior year of high school and asked my little cast of characters, "What happened?"<br>  <br>  I swiftly regretted asking them for the story. Because they gave me a story I wasn't expecting. More specifically, Edward told me something I didn't want to hear.<br>  <br>  I should probably mention here that I am not crazy (that I know of), it's just that I am a character writer. I write my stories because of my characters; they are the motivation and the reward. The difficulty with strong, defined characters, though, is that you can't make them do something that is out of character. They have to be who they are and, as a writer, they're often out of your control.<br>  <br>  As I started plotting New Moon (untitled at that point), it became clear that Edward was Edward, and he would have to behave as only Edward would. And, because of that, Edward was leaving.<br>  <br>  NO! I didn't want Edward to leave. I pitched a fit every bit as violent and tearful as those I've seen in New Moon discussion forums. I tried to talk him out of it. I presented him with other plot options. I begged. Edward remained unmoved.<br>  <br>  Someday, when Midnight Sun (Edward's version of Twilight) is available, I think you'll understand better what was going on in the boy's head. See, just as Bella doesn't think she's good enough for Edward, Edward sees himself as a soulless monster destroying Bella's life and endangering her afterlife. The incident with Jasper acts as a catalyst, forcing him to act. He is determined to save Bella. He thinks the best way to do this is to take the vampires out of her life.<br>  <br>  Is he being silly? In some ways, yes. But he can't see any other way to protect Bella. Edward's dealing with the idea that if he hadn't been quick enough, if he hadn't read Jasper's thoughts just in the nick of time, then would that—death—have been better for Bella than a life with Edward? If she died at eighteen and went to heaven, wouldn't that be better than an immortal but soulless and damned existence? Edward thinks so. However, he knows he'd never be able to watch her die. Consequently, he'd better get away from her before something happens that makes biting her a necessity...<br>  <br>  So there I was, wit|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Done and dusted.|`|OrKLpzenaa	Casting is pretty much done since they have ideas of who they want to play each character.

yvyewZrWaa	The theme of resurrection within "A Tale of Two Cities" is intended to reflect the human capacity for change. The aforementioned characters exemplify alteration for the best after a period of darkness; Dr. Manette awakens to care and happiness after nearly two decades in solitude, Sydney Carton finds meaning after a life of ennui, Charles Darnay manages to leave his unpleasant connections behind him and start afresh after a long, grueling trial/imprisonment. The characters' personal resurrections serve to mirror the circumstances in France -- Dickens suggests through the repetition of the idea that the Reign of Terror was only a necessary period of darkness, before the country could be reborn as a far better place.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I left anything out -- it was quite a lot to process. Anyway, hope that helps.|`|2M4FhPVwaa	The theme of resurrection first appears when Mr. Lorry replies to the message carried by Jerry Cruncher with the words "Recalled to Life". Then, during Mr. Lorry's coach ride to Dover, he ponders repeatedly a hypothetical conversation with Dr. Manette:("Buried how long?" "Almost eighteen years." ... "You know that you are recalled to life?" "They tell me so.") He regards himself as the vehicle for Dr. Manette's revival, and imagines himself physically "digging" Dr. Manette from his grave.<br>  <br>  Jerry is also drawn into the theme: he himself is involved in death and resurrection in way that the reader does not yet know. The first piece of foreshadowing comes in his remark to himself: "You'd be in a blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!" The black humour of this statement becomes obvious only in hindsight. One stormy night five years later (in June 1780[13]), Mr. Lorry reawakens the reader's interest in the mystery by telling Jerry that it is "Almost a night ... to bring the dead out of their graves". Jerry responds firmly that he has never seen the night do that<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The theme of resurrection first appears when Mr. Lorry replies to the message carried by Jerry Cruncher with the words "Recalled to Life".

Compromises were made to placate those States/Regions that insisted on maintaining Slavery.  These States, or rather the men speaking for these States, said that if they were not allowed to keep the institution of slavery, then they break away and formed their own nation.  The framers of the Contitution felt it was better to have  a nation  with slavery than to break up the current compact between States.  <br>  <br>  Peace///////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Such as dialogue, plot, climax, point of view, setting, descriptive writing, character development etc.  An exercise can include a sensory test, describe the item you just touched in the brown bag; or a look at the picture and write down the first thing that comes to your mind; or pick anyone in the room and write a paragraph about them.  It could be a grammar exercise where you are asked to place punctuation in sentences.<br>    -----  Writing prompts are more free writing.  A sentence or subject and you're off with a limit of 500 words or 1 chapter.  Most of the time the scene and specifics are left up to you.  ie:  Oh my goodness I can't believe that!  Now you add more to that one statement.  You can use any of the elements or none of the elements that are from the exercises.  You can use the point of view techniques you've just learned about or stick to what you are most comfortable with.<br>  ---  Ideally prompts are to get your juices of creativity flowing in a fun, unpressured way.

Portugal was the first to sail around Africa to India, and Portugal also established relations with the African kingdoms.<br>  <br>  Spain went west.  Columbus believed that he could get to the East by sailing west and he would have been right... except that America was in the way.  After Spain established a presence and began to bring back gold, other countries began to follow suit.|`|xb14WQdwaa	(this is by memory) there were several reasons:<br>  <br>  because of the renaissance there were inventions that helped the journey (i think compass) and then there was the need for a new route to asia

Kate Brian hasn't released her rights to put online, I don't think she believes in that, but I totally see where your coming from. <br>  <br>  But for your sake, I got the early release for it, and was totally disappointed by it. I won't give any spoilers for you, but I'm just going to say to not be to excited for it, it might let you down.

mbXHkf1maa	> What page is this on in the Odyssey?<br>  <br>  There's no standard answer.  The page number varies with different editions, and the Odyssey is anyhow divided not into pages but 24 Books. However, the section you want is in Book XII, when they've just got past the Sirens, and the crew are getting scared about Scylla and Charybdis.<br>  <br>  This section starts a bit after XII:205:<br>  “‘Friends, hitherto we have been in no wise ignorant of sorrow; surely this evil that besets us now is no greater than when the Cyclops penned us in his hollow cave by brutal strength; yet even thence we made our escape through my valor and counsel and wit; these dangers, too, methinks we shall some day remember.<br>  (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136&layout=&loc=12.205" rel="nofollow">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/pte...</a> )<br>  <br>  In this slightly different translation (The Odyssey, Homer, A.

But here's a way to find it no matter what translation or edition you're looking at:  It's in Book 12, and in Richmond Latimore's translation it's lines 208-213.  The line numbers may be slightly different in other translations, but if you look for line 210, you won't be far from it.
3kdBGLxCaa	I have read Eragon and Eldest. Eldest was harder but thats because the author (Christopher Polloline) was 18 when he wrote eragon and he was like 20 when he wrote Eldest so he was more a more experienced writer wich led to Eldest being a harder read.

BiXxJd2Faa	It depends exactly what is meant by "humanity" in the first sentence. But it talks about separate systems for plants, trees etc, all of which are interconnected and so ultimately form one system obviously.  So if it's talking about humanity in the same way, it means our existence on the planet as a species and in a relationship with the environment.<br>  <br>  So it's saying there are parallels between the humans in nature and the rest of the natural world, but of course they're part of the same thing anyway, so bound to be parallels - just different parts of the natural world.  <br>  <br>  Anyway perhaps included in "humanity" here is some of the processes that arise out of the coming of civilisation and so on, and these, though they might appear separate sometimes, will include processes which are connected with and have parallels with the natural world.  It might also be talking about our consciousness of ourselves and nature which is an extra factor different (apparently) to the rest of nature, hence the comment about stewardship.  <br>  <br>  This is one attempt to analyse it anyway, and probably flawed.  It would help to know exactly what is meant by the "systems of humanity", in the first sentence, but I've tried to give some pointers.|`|dL4x119gaa	for every action there is a reaction.<br>  <br>  everything affects everything else.<br>  <br>  humanity and nature are reflections of each other.|`|UDQqY3pHaa	sure|`|AeZMqTEVaa	Parallel = Similar (In mathematics, two parallel lines going in the same direction, never meet or intersect. Think of this as two things always being the same distance apart, so they are ALWAYS similar.) In this case, humanity and nature (trees and animals) are very alike. Sentence two just goes deeper off this point, saying how one thing always changes another thing. Sentence 3 goes right out to say that -- an imbalance (something going wrong) in one system upsets another. Think of it like a domino effect, if one domino piece falls down, it hits the next, and the next, and soon that one domino piece has caused a huge disaster.<br>  The next sentence says that nature works to our benefit. It would be something like a hand holding the first domino up so that it does not hurt the rest. The hand would be 'the natural world'.<br>  Sentence 5 just talks about balance in the systems; the systems depend on each other. It's like the saying "can't live with it, but can't live without it". Sentence 6 talks about how (once again) the systems between humanity and the natural environment are dependent on each other, and manage each other by watching out for each other's backs like two good friends.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped. What was it for? Hope I was right :)|`|pnoQFcT4aa	That, although humanity may believe that it is superior in most respects, it is only so with the grace of nature.

draNVjbkaa	Unless you have a CELEBRITY endorsement, several appearances in major films and television shows, you DON'T have a chance with CAA, William Morris, UTA, ICM, and Endeavor. You also DON'T have a chance with B Agencies like Gersh, Paradigm, and Stone Manners without the things mentioned earlier. These agencies DON'T take new talent.<br>  <br>  To get an agent in general, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them. By showcase I do not mean scammy conventions like IMTA, Proscout, or Best New Talent. I mean legit ones like at TVI, Reel pros, etc.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do. Agents usually make 10% on film/tv and commercials and 20% on commercial print<br>  <br>  There are FAKE agencies like John Casablancas, Barbizon, and JRP. John Casablancas, Barbizon and John Robert Powers are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.<br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.
rT22hTL0aa	That is dependent on your soundcard or the keyboard/synth you are using for playback.  First of all, set it to channel 9 or 10 (which are usually the percussion channels -- although my synth also has a channel 16 percussion).  If you have info (manuals) from your sound card or synthesizer you should find charts in them to show you where the instruments are.  If you don't have the manuals, you may be able to download them from the website of the company that makes your soundcard/synth.  If that is not possible, then you may have to use your ear.  Place a note on every spot of the staff (including ledger lines below and above) and listen to the playback to determine what they are).   A couple fairly standard things:  Bass drum is usually the C below the bass clef staff.  Snare drum is often the E just above that.  The hi hat is usually the Bb (2nd line bass clef) and Crash cymal is often C# (2nd space bass cleff).  Triangle is often on A (ledger line above the treble staff) and wood block is often E (fourth line treble staff).  Hope this helps!

qqnC3Xinaa	It isn't spiritual at all, really.  Everyone is quite focused on propriety, but that is largely due to the era and the fact that they live in a relatively small community.  Both Mary, the daughter who lectures on virtue, and Mr. Collins, a clergyman, are seen as fools.<br>  <br>  The mood of the book is by turns romantic and comic.

RQfLKOPQaa	Well it shouldn't be banned. It's a story written by a great writer, and with relevant content for the time when he lived. It provides useful information for anyone wanting to learn how life was in the old days. It also provides a background  to compare current events to, and teaches us lessons that otherwise might be forgotten. <br>  If history is hidden from us, how can we learn from the mistakes of the past? We must be able to learn from all possible sources, so that we can compare, if not we are throwing our freedom of thought away, and just following what the majority wants us to follow, regardless of what is right or what is wrong. I am against censorship in all it's forms, if someone censors, then it's because someone read it. And if someone read, and say that you can't read, then they are just saying that they can do it because they are better and smarter, and you can't read it because you are more stupid and would be unable to deal with it. Well I am not stupid, I can read just fine, and am perfectly able to understand literature, I don't need a censor to tell me what's good for me.<br>  <br>  As for reasons to ban the book. You can say that you don't want to be protected from what happened before your time, and you would rather not know.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	There are no good reasons why *any* book should be banned. But nonetheless, hyper-PC school administrations have often banned it from their libraries, basically because Twain's characters use a pejorative term for blacks, and because Twain assigned what we could consider stereotypical forms of black speech and mannerisms to Jim. <br>  <br>  The problem I have with the debate is that Twain's characterization was not intended to be racist or inflammatory. In fact, it probably didn't raise any eyebrows at all when it was published. That was simply the way American culture was at the time. It's a valuable piece of literature because it gives us a snapshot of America in Twain's time -- you just have to approach it in context, rather than by applying modern tastes and sensitivities to it.|`|sbKWMMv9aa	It is banned for the frequent use of the N word.|`|TU7vDI95aa	Are you trying to say it SHOULD be banned?  Because that is completely ridiculous.|`|79YQAbSRaa	Banning the book for use of a racial slur or because it depicts slavery doesn't erase the concept from American History.   <br>  <br>  I have heard of people trying to ban it from a public school's required reading list, but banning something considered offensive to some caters to those easily offended.   Reading a work of literature as part of a class in probably the best way to deal with sensitive subject matter.  Raising a public outcry over it leads to an increase in the negativity which  is counter-productive.   <br>  <br>  If you have the assignment of taking the pro side in a debate over the banning of this particular book, it would be a hard sell at best. I honestly can't think of a reason in favor of banning.|`|aGynBPbCaa	Why would you want to ban huck finn?  I swear.... kids see worse stuff on tv!  video games, movies... thats an American classic.

Since these two arguments counter each other it might be best to chose which one you feel you can argue.  <br>  <br>  For many people that is the obvious use of n*****.  Etymology-wise this word actually is fairly neutral; however over the years it has come to carry negative connotations if spoken by a non-black person because (though not always howbeit our culture associates it with this) it is hostile term of abuse or contempt.  This definition of n*****  along with the way Jim is treated is demeaning towards blacks.  It teaches kids that it's okay to use that term.  Thus it should not be used in the classroom.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with the argument above and I appolize that I can't argue it full-heartedly.  However, I hope it help you come up with some ideas.

What many people don't realize is that he only freed slaves in Confederate states (which he really didn't have the authority to do, but that's another question entirely).

xOtILqjSaa	Alright I'll take a swing at this ;D<br>  <br>  Ok so God made man, and while doing so he also gave us free will and logic of which people have and use all the time. Free will and common sense are the tools with which we act but of which God has no control over, only influence. Therefore god cannot be held accountble for human action because even if his influence is sinful we are armed with common sense and the free will to rebuke his orders.<br>  Thus God cannot be held accountable for any act of humanity or inhumanity. He is completely unliable for any sin or great deed any person has achieved because when it comes right down to it every person decides for themselves whether they'll sin or not.So individually, we decide the sins and great deeds we commit regardless of Gods influence. <br>  Taking this idea that common sense and free will are the tools we use to determine if we will or have sined or not you can also state that God can also be held fully responsible for every human action because he gave us these gifts in the first place.<br>  <br>  Good luck on you're essay =)|`|fzANVpWqaa	If one believes in God and that he created Adam & Eve (original sin) than he's responsible to the extent that God instilled in us free will, the choice whether to sin or not.

P5K41vYbaa	Henry VIII created the Church of England for a quite strange reason: he wanted to divorce from his wife and marry another woman. The only one that could undo a marriage at that time in the Catholic world was the Pope, and he didn't accept. So King Henry separated England from the Catholic world by creating a new Church, which he structured so it would be righter than the Catholic one.<br>  <br>  I don't know how Queen Elizabeth restored religious peace in her kingdom, but she probably used very strict laws to her advantage.<br>  <br>  At the time of the Reformation, more and more Catholics were turning to Protestantism. The Pope organized the Council of Trent to reform the Catholic Church according to the will of the Catholics themselves, so that he could limit the number of people escaping from his grasp.<br>  <br>  Some countries, such as France, wouldn't allow other religions than their own on their lands. The people of other religions eventually refused to leave, and violent battles exploded between the fanatics of different religions living together in the same cities. Even Paris, the heart of Europe, had blood running down its streets. In every country, the rulers' finally found ways of stopping the conflicts: King Henry IV's laws in France, Queen Elizabeth's strict politics in Great Britain, The Council of Trent and the Inquisition in Italy and Spain.

For a performance, you need the best you can get, and she will have to buy them for you.<br>  <br>  I'd ask her asap so she wouldn't get mad at you for putting it off.  Just tell her you're sorry, and that you understand their value and you'll take much better care of them this time.<br>  <br>  Or, ask your teacher to talk to her if she won't buy them, that always works.|`|EZHXhsLTaa	well ballet is expensive. try gaynor minden's. they are around 100 bucks but they last about a year.|`|0WASp0bHaa	pointe shoes are not made to last long.

X48z0Lwwaa	You are right to an extent.  You are suggesting that color is relative.<br>  Imagine if your eye could see the ENTIRE electromagnetic spectrum.  For us, radio waves would be deep red (long wavelength), and violet would be cosmic rays (very short wavelength).  The world would be a very different looking place.  Because the ability of the eye to perceive color is dependent on the sensitivity of our eyes to varied wavelengths of light, we see colors as they appear to our eyes and brains.  In other words, color is in our minds, not an inherent property of a given wavelength of light.  Light itself has no color, just wavelength.  We have evolved to perceive different wavelengths as different "colors".  We might say color is more a property of our eyes and brains than it is a property of light itself.<br>  <br>  I never really contemplated this question quite like this.  Thanks for asking it.|`|pnoQFcT4aa	Colour is a secondary quality of objects, meaning that it is not within objects themselves nor within the observer but a combination of both. Try reversing the question; Would colour exist without objects? The answer would be no, and the answer to whether colour exists without the observer, would also be no.|`|Y3haExcnaa	Actually, the answer is clear, surprisingly! <br>  <br>  If you were in a dark room without ANY light, objects would be CLEAR!<br>  Color is just the absorbed and reflected light. If light wasn't there, there wouldn't be color, therefore making it clear. <br>  <br>  :D|`|AA11635601	Good question.  There is no such thing as color except in human experience, as far as we know.  There is light of definite wavelengths, which in us triggers various perceptions of color, but color is not at all inherent to light or certain wavelengths of it.<br>  <br>  Bravo to you for making the distinction.|`|00dde3824bb31a5760d4b4cdc75e4641aa	Color itself is something that appears within your own consciousness. The entire external world from your perspective exists within you own consciousness. So without your perception of it.... color may not exist. (I'm not saying it doesn't, I'm just saying it might not).... I need to stop reading about solipsism....!

I can't wait for the film to come out.|`|LeFkaKhOaa	The Vampire Diaries-L.J. Smith. VERY GOOD!!!!! The first book is The Awakening and The Struggle (Two books are combined in one. This was a 4 book series, but they condensed it into 2 and republished it)<br>  <br>  The House of Night series-P.C Cast + Kristen Cast. EXTREMELY GOOD!!!! It gets better each book!! First book: Marked. This has alot of cussing and dirty talk, so only read this if you are very mature.<br>  <br>  Uglies series- Scott Westerfeld. An amazing sci fi. Truly amazing. First book: Uglies.<br>  <br>  Midnighters-Scott Westerfeld. I didn't really think it would be good, but I was out of books for the moment so I checked it out, and it was really good! Better than I thought. Scott Westerfeld is an awsome writer.<br>  <br>  Maximum Ride-James Patterson. Really good!!! Prepare to soar, literally! First book: Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment.<br>  <br>  Skinned- Robin Wasserman. Another cool sci fi. <br>  <br>  Warriors series-Erin Hunter. If you are a cat lover, or enjoy animal stories, then you would probably like this one. There are three separate series in this, so be sure to get the very first one. It is Into the Wild.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Most of these are becoming movies, too! You should also just browse Barnes & Nobles, too. That is how I found most of these amazing stories.|`|RvB0Xd7Haa	read the watchmen graphic novels i know that the r comics bout they are simply amazing
4c2b4b3698607bc95dd331438404d7e8aa	I haven't read it for a few years but I imagine it was set at around the time he wrote it, 1860-ish - the mid-Victorian era.<br>  <br>  (I loved it - it's so creepy and scary, when I was halfway through it, I did something I've never done before or since with a novel - I turned to the last page to check if the main characters have died or not!)<br>  <br>  Edit: it was written in 1859-60 and I really don't think it was set in the future. The first public railway line in England was opened in 1803. The first fare-paying, passenger railway service in the world was established in Wales in 1807.|`|0KqCsW8gaa	After the advent of railways. Around 1870.
vDGFRACaaa	I hate it when that happens. It's like the author completely forgot what happened in the last book and just starts off writing anew.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is ignore the plotholes and just enjoy the story. Pretend that the books were written by one of the characters who later had altzheimers and forgot parts of the story. Still dramatic, just.. missing parts.
G4iHDhpvaa	There is no exact date. She is however writing it. It has been confirmed to me as I mailed her publishers my cover idea and the replied saying she was working really hard on finishing the book. So it WILL be coming out but there is no confirmed date.|`|m3rt9x8Caa	She says on her website that she has to be in a certain mood to write a story. She will rewrite it but maybe not until the end of this year or the next.<br>  <br>  I know its really irritating, i can't wait for it to come out.|`|y9GcEsEYaa	Midnight Sun may never be published, but Stephenie Meyers has posted the first few hundred pages on her website www.stepheniemeyer.com for fans to read.|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	Nobody really knows, it wont be for a while because it was leaked on the internet. <br>  you can read the first like 100 pages on the stephanie meyer website for free...|`|GSRBodwEaa	It's been put on hold due to the first 12 chapters being leaked to the internet, she might never release.|`|w3yrnDEiaa	The Search Bar is looking for you.
dZyoGbUdaa	Not sure which book you are thinking of so here is a possibility, "Where the Wild Things Are" by Maurice Sendak.  It has giant monster/animals and great illustrations.|`|79YQAbSRaa	Someone else was looking for a book that sounds similar to this a few days ago...they said the contraptions and weapons looked almost like DaVinci's sketches.  Sound the same?
UVnr7wrmaa	Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen, J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer, Bryce Courtenay, Phillip Paulman.<br>  <br>  They're all great authors and not one of them has any bad stories :)<br>  <br>  I've neve heard of Markus Zusak, but I have heard of Sarah Dessen. I too think that she's an excellent author :)<br>  <br>  Everyone has different opinions when it comes to reading, because everyone likes different things, am I right? Books are wonderful things :)|`|R02aazVdaa	Well, do you mean talented authors in the mainstream, or often overlooked authors who deserve the limelight? <br>  <br>  Because if it is that they aren't very well known, I think John Green and Markus Zusak are ones that fit that description.|`|FAUPZeSxaa	Sorry but I really don't think Sarah Dessen is any good.  I read two of her books and didn't like them at all.  I have yet to read anything by Markus Zusak but I plan too.  Here are the authors I think are the best: <br>  <br>  J. K. Rowling (first author to be a billionaire) <br>  Christopher Paolini (he wrote Eragon when he was 15!) <br>  Philip Pullman (His Dark Materials is completely original and absolutely amazing and the way he ends it!)<br>  Suzanne Colins (I keep reading the Hunger Games over and over again, I can't stop!)<br>  D. J. MacHale (simply because his idea was so original, and the books just kept getting better and better)<br>  Cassandra Clare (I LOVE THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS)|`|w3yrnDEiaa	Markus Zusak<br>  Anne Rice<br>  Poppy Z.
