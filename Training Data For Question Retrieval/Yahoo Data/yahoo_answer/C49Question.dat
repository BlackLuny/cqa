20090223164400AAs4O95	Politics & Government;Politics	Marijuana decriminalization as the answer to economic downfall?	Could legalization of marijuana use and strong emphasis on being a responsible individual in society bring us out of this economic downfall? Drug laws have only been around for a little over a half a century and before that time, people were responsible and had a greater understanding for one's duties as an individual to our society. Has our psychology changed from that of our ancestors? Could it be that society has taken this emphasis of responsibility out of our culture by enacting frivolous lawsuits and law combined with this "dog-eat-dog" mentality that seems to drive our economy?   Anyone with even a fundamental knowledge of economics can state the law of supply and demand. Meaning that at any time there is a demand for any service, that there will be a supply, and that the price of this service will reflect the availability of this demand. I see the world of responsible psychedelic drug use as an untapped philosophical and economic breakthrough. Can responsibility be defined in a literal sense or does an individual's life experiences shape the way we interact and view society as a whole. Tell me what you think.

I see a recent trend where right wing talking heads like Hannity on Fox claim "economists say" FDR's New Deal stimulus policies made the Great Depression worse.  Don't they know we can simply google the data?  Recessions and depressions are measured by shrinking gross domestic product.  GDP shrunk at an alarming -13.0% in 1932, the year FDR took office, was flat at -1.3% in '33, then made stunning gains in 10 of the remaining years of FDR's presidency.  10.8% in '34, 8.9% in '35, 13.0% in '36...

20090223170107AADfckT	Politics & Government;Politics	Did you see Ron Paul on the promised Fed 'transparency'? 'Little better than window dressing at best utterly?	useless at worst?'      " The Fed is now pledging to reveal to the public more about its economic predictions, and calls this greater transparency. This is little more than window-dressing, at best, utterly useless at worst. Many analysts, especially those familiar with the Austrian school of economics, saw the current economic crisis coming years ago when the Federal Reserve was still telling the American people their policies were as good as gold. So while it might be nice to know what fantasy-infused outlook the Fed has on the economy, I am much more interested in what they are doing as a result of their faulty, haphazard interpretation of data. For instance, what arrangements do they have with other foreign central banks? What the Fed does on that front could very well affect or undermine foreign policy, or even contribute to starting a war.       We also need to know the source and destination of funds provided through the Fed’s emergency funding facilities. Information such as this will provide a more accurate and complete picture of the true cost of these endless bailouts and spending packages, and could very likely affect the decisions being made in Congress. But with so much of the Fed’s business cloaked in secrecy, these latest initiatives will not even scratch the surface of the Fed’s opaque operations. People are demanding answers and explanations for our economic malaise, and we should settle for nothing less than the whole truth on monetary policy.      The first step is to pass legislation I will soon introduce requiring an audit of the Federal Reserve so we can at least get an accurate picture of what is happening with our money. If this audit reveals what I suspect, and Congress has finally had enough, they can also pass my legislation to abolish the Federal Reserve and put control of the economy’s lifeblood, the currency, back where it Constitutionally belongs. If Congress refuses to do these two things, the very least they could do is repeal legal tender laws and allow people to choose a different currency in which to operate. If the Fed refuses to open its books to an audit, and Congress refuses to demand this, the people should not be subject to the whims of this secretive and incompetent organization.

20090223165921AABdhTt	Politics & Government;Politics	Will the Big 3 be profitable anymore?	Most of the big 3's problems are unions and government regulations.  If they can over come these two issues than they can compete and be profitable again.      Can some billionaire step in and buy them out and revive these companies?      I don't believe that Americans are idiots and can't build reliable vehicles.  I just think there are poor leadership in these companies that care more about bonuses than the long term of the companies.  Also, they know that these are the only American auto makers left and know that the companies will be bailed out.  If anyone has enough guts and cash steps in and takes over, it will be good bet to put money on?      I, personally, feel that if left alone to the same leadership, nothing will change.  Sure their stocks may rise up again to the tens but again the major issues will still be there: quality issue, unions and regulations.      What do you have to share about these American auto makers?

This has been standard Republican policy since Reagan.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_...       The goal was to run MASSIVE budget deficits, and create a huge debt for our country. In this way, the money could not be 'wasted' on programs such as health care or education. This was achieved through major spending increases to defense (or anything but on the people) and major cuts in revenue (taxes).      What's ironic about this is that most people who claim to be Republicans act like their party is for LOW SPENDING and BALANCED BUDGETS. This could not be further from the truth.....and any look at the facts makes this painfully obvious. So, they don't even know the goals their own party was working for.      Need I even point out what party has ran RECORD DEFICITS EVERY YEAR REPUBLICANS HELD POWER going back to Reagan?      Reagan - set record deficits      Bush - set record deficits      Clinton - set record SURPLUSES      Bush - set record deficits (adding 6 TRILLION to our national debt)      Now, our country is most definitely starved....economically crippled.

It is uneducated to think the Republicans caused this because:   Since 2006, the Democrats have controlled both houses of Congress.   Congress makes the economic policy decisions, NOT PRESIDENT BUSH.   Bush has nothing to do with the economy, CONGRESS HAS ALL THE BLAME.   Even Obama, who tries to make policy decisions, can only propose a bill, THE CONGRESS MAKES THE FINAL DECISION.   So hence the party of wasteful spending, unnecessary handouts, allowing our enemies to get away with terrorism, socialism, and sky-high taxes control this nation now.   GOD HELP US!!!

The HDI combines three basic dimensions:          * Life expectancy at birth, as an index of population health and longevity       * Knowledge and education, as measured by the adult literacy rate (with two-thirds weighting) and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio (with one-third weighting).       * Standard of living, as measured by the natural logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) in United States dollars.

Alright, so my friend got busted for stealing 2 cd's one of them he opened up, and one he didn't. It wasn't only me though, it was 3 other kids, so really it was us 5. He got busted, and then he needed to pay back the store for opening it.       He was smart enough not to run like my other friend did ( in the exact same store) so he didn't get into big trouble.       So he comes over to me asking me for money and I handed it over to him because I didn't want him to go to jail. The owner then comes over and says "oh this guy was blocking the camera, this guy was in the way of the girl over there watching them, and then he says "why don't you take all of them with you because these assholes look like thieves."        I think he said that because we all look like metalheads and have long hair and whatnot.      What got me pissed off was the owner knows me from before because i go to the store like every weekend and i NEVER steal anything. I have a clean record. The guy even gave me a lecture when i was with my other friends when some other retard stole something.      I was on the other side of the store when this all happened , looking for Street Fighter 4 because it came out. I even had the money on me to buy it, and they still acused me of stealing.      Luckily I'm 15 and i can't go to jail yet T.T      They also banned me from the store ( this is inside a shopping center ) but it's the only store that i go to down there.      Should i get my mom to drive down there with me and talk to the owner about what happened? I didn't even know all this **** was happening, and now I'm banned from a great store because some friend of mine did something stupid, AFTER being with me and my other friend when he stole something.

This was back in the 60s when every other person wasn't a lawyer, and graduating from Harvard it would seem like he should get a high-paying job right away.  So it seems kind of odd that he would join the army after law school, and more odd that he would only serve six months.  But nothing on the internet seems to describe this period in more detail.  Was he trying to be JAG?  Was he drafted for Nam?  I'm curious about Nader's post-law school life because I wanna be a consumer advocate like he used to be before he went crazy.

20090426062413AAPYmSA	Politics & Government;Government	Are the American people guilty of torturing their presidents and government representatives?	This is the UN definition of torture.  Note the phrase severe pain or suffering whether physical or m e n t a l.      "For the purposes of this Convention, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions."       Bush said he ignored public opinion polls and did not watch the media discussions about him.  Obama, on the other hand, watches polls closely and is paying attention to what people are saying.  People say some really stupid, cruel things about our elected officials.

20090222154828AA1xerG	Politics & Government;Politics	Conservatives/libertarians - are you sure privatization of Social Security is the free market approach?	It seems to me that if privatization - generally sold as a free market alternative to the existing system - would have passed, there would be intense pressure on government to reflate asset prices and/or compensate people who've "lost" lots of money.      If memory serves, I think I read a libertarian perspective agreeing with this conclusion on the Mises Institute site a while back. However, I think it's still very much a minority position amongst libertarians and conservatives - could one of you enlighten me?

As we have seen in the past that after afghanistan was freed from russians it became a breeding place for religious extremisim. The iraq-iran war is one more example of pseudo islamic elements making war. Will the wise members of islamic society take drastic actions to curb fundamentalism and violence against women after they achieve freedom from america and israel? Will those islamic elements make peace? Will the inhuman laws be removed from islamic countries? I am not saying they should become democratic because its again a western term but a NEW LAW made by the islamic scholars which respects arabic culture or their scriptures. Will this ever happen or are islamic nations just crying foul for being opressed while they continue to take up violence even after the wars are over?

20090222155211AAOsWxi	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Isn't the Social Security Administration discriminating against the disabled?	When a disabled person applies for their SSD benefits (which they have paid for through FICA taxes in their employment check), the Social Security Administration calculates out exactly how much money that individual needs. The disabled also receives Medicare.      Unlike Medicaid, Medicare only pays for a portion of a disabled person's medical bill. If however, he/she finds a doctor who accepts Medicare as 'full payment' for their services, then the disabled must only meet the deductible amount.      Unfortunately, the SSA has calculated the amount needed to survive which doesnt include such frivolous expenses such as the deductible on Medicare.      Out of the grace of God, let's say the individual never needs medical healthcare (highly unlikely for the disabled). The inidividual's mother and father pass away and leave money in trust for their child. The child, thru the love of his/her parents, can now breathe a little easier as a dividend check begins to arrive from the trust account. Oops, SSA caught that. You have income so your disability check gets reduced. You're back where you started from. Oh but guess what? You no longer qualify to get food stamps because you have assets. You must deplete that account before they will allow you to have the money which you are entitled to...which you have already paid for.       A friend or relative gets ou a car from the junkyard...5 years old....was beautiful when it was new but it's seen better days. That's okay..from point A to point B, right? The money you spend on cabs or fueling friends' vehicles, you can spend on gas an cheap insurance for your car. This should make life easier...a piece of the american dream....      Who am I kidding? The minute your name lands on that car's title, you lose your food stamps, heat assistance, and disabled status. You now have zero income. Just because a kind aunt or uncle gifted you.      There is a mistake on your check, they give you $25 too much in one check. They find the mistake and adjust your check for the entire quarter stating that you had too much income in that quarter. But it was their fault.       You receive $100 from some philanthropist for being his consultant. Basically some nice guy visited your home, felt sorry and did a nice thing. This philanthopist writes it off which tips the SSA and there they are with talons outstretched. You have made income! You cant be anything else but lower class poverty stricken people! Youre disabled! Your check gets stopped until they determine what income is being made. That's ok..not on disability now...apply for welfare....Sorry, you have more than $1500 worth of furniture in your home. No welfare for you until you sell it and prove that you can eat worms! We're not allowed a good life...we're disabled!       I apologize if some of you think that being on disability is "having everything paid for" because it isnt. Every month we wonder if that check will be in our mailbox and will it be the full amount or will they have deducted something out of it. And if they did, how do we make up the difference?  Eat more canned meat?      I know Social Security Disability is to help people who are physically emotionally inapacitated but once the SSA gets us on the floor, they wont let us back up. There HAS to be a different way of doing this. I want to be able to smile, live a long life...or maybe just not whince when I see what I'm having for dinner.      I wish I could work....I really, really wish I could work.

20090222160036AAJD97G	Politics & Government;Politics	Have you ever noticed that Obama sheep cannot drive?	Every day on the way to and from work I observe them trying to drive their vehicles on public roads. How do I know they are Obama sheep? Simple -- I just have to note the collection of Obama related bumper stickers on their car ("Change", "Hope", "Obama",  )      Observation #1:      Obama sheep do not understand that a turn signal should be used to ...well SIGNAL! Some of them will actually turn it on, but not until they have actually started their turn. Others will continue down the road at the posted speed limit, then cram on their brakes, coming to a complete stop and then turn on their signal. But most O-sheep don't even use the signal at all.      Observation #2:      O-sheep rarely drive the speed limit. I actually witnessed one entering an Interstate on-ramp going 25 mph (despite not having a car in front of him for several thousand feet). As a result, all the poor people behind him (including me) were forced to dangerously enter the freeway at hazardous slow speeds. It was entertaining to see an 18-wheeler almost hit the nut as he had no merging skills either, but seriously O-sheep should just turn in their licenses and their cars. Obama doesn't want to lose his supporters this way.      Observation #3      O-sheep will ALWAYS begin braking for a stop light so long as said stop light is red and within their sight. They don't understand they are 1,000+ feet away and that they need to arrive in the vicinity of the stop light to trigger a sensor to cause it to turn green. I suppose when you barely graduate high school and don't pursue college they don't learn about the world and how it works :( Sadly, I wish the DMV drivers test would catch such incompetencies.      I'll post some more observations later as I want to eat my dinner. What have you noticed about O-Sheep? Personally, I think they should just stick to public transport.

I see a lot of talk about certain people being good, or certain people being more politically correct than somebody else. It's a complete load of crap if you ask me.      When was the last time you did anything that wasn't just for yourself?      A republican friend of mine was blowing steam about this guy he saw on the street one night. This guy was with his girlfriend and was beating on her so he went over to him and beat him up. Then he just left her there, and that's the type of crap I am talking about when I really consider the extent of callousness in the republican party.   This guy would rather be macho and beat on his chest in order to make himself feel better than actually solve the problem by giving her a ride to a shelter, helping her call the police and get an order of protection, help her build confidence so she can find her own place... or even just sit down and have a conversation. No, instead he went off and acted like a "tough guy"...      ...Just like more than half of you crony little pigs (with and without the lipstick) sitting here talking like you are so much better, as if your ideas are so much more pure than anybody elses... when all you really do is belittle people and then get all upset when someone actually has the nerve to stand up to you.

I can see if you hate our government but just the average person? Why? We are not the people you think we are. Most of us are not idiots, the reason you think we are is because the media reports on idiots because of higher ratings. We are not violent, you think we are because of the government in Iraq Iran and Afghanistan. But probably 90% of us want to pull out of the war. I mean why do you guys hate us? I see that there are alot of people on here to that don't hate us but im talking to the ones who do hate us. The reason you see so much bad **** about us on the news is because your media is like ours. Reporting on other people making mistakes gets more media attention, which also gives them more money.......Look all i'm asking is that you at least talk to some of us with an open mind. Don't have your mind already made up. Just give us a chance......
20090222154750AAkvAnZ	Politics & Government;Government	What does everyone think of Obama's stimulus plan?	I currently live in Northeast Missisippi. Served 4 years in active army, fought the war in Iraq for a year, and came home to go without a job for 2 years.  Now, I understand I am not the only one trying to make ends meet without a job on unemployment benefits.  This is a hard time on a lot of people, and I'm sure it is a lot worse in other places right now and my heart goes out to those people.  But what I don't understand is why our governor here in MS is thinking about not actually taking part of the money from the stimulus plan that would keep money in the pockets of those that are out of work right now.  Where I live there are no jobs to be had, and the ones that are had are on the brink of being lost, and to take away these benefits would really leave a lot of us in a very tough situation!  Why would he not take this money??  If he goes through with this he would be leaving a lot of us here in MS with no job, no money, and he really isn't offering a lot of hope.  Why in the world would our Gov. go against something that would keep food on the tables of his people???  Please let me know what everyone thinks about this...

20090222155144AASPsZj	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Death in the Family, Need some legal advice.?	Hello everyone thanks for taking your time out to help me with my situation. I do not have all the details but I will try to make it as clear as possible. My girlfriends father just passed recently and he had a home (his mothers) left to him and his two other brothers. I do not believe he had a will written out as to who gets his share of the sale of the home in case he died. Does this automatically get passed to the next of kin (his daughter and son)? Because now her uncle is trying to put it into probate so they do not get their fathers share of the sale of the home. I know i do not have all the details but any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

These labels have had a negative connotation for a while now with the opposite "stereotype".  People should think for themselves and ignore labels.  Educate yourself and act on what you think is right, not what your parents, family or region have traditionally voted.  Politicians want you to remain ignorant on the issues.  Think before you decide

Due to some problems (my in-laws used to harass me mentally for each and every small thing) myself and my husband are staying separately from each other.My In-laws,Husband,His sister's family are planning for divorce from me now..And they are unable to show the strong reason in getting rid of me.Simple reasons like i'm not respecting his parents,not giving proper food to him intime etc..Now my husband left me at my parents home in India and he left to US without informing me.Before leaving he wrote a REGISTERED Letter stating that he dropped me at my home according to MY WISH on a PARTICULAR DATE..But after that i wrote some 10to15 e-mails asking him to take me back and called him so many times.But he's not responding at all inturn he's sending those mails to my in-laws in india thru e-mail.And now i came to know the reason behind him mentioning the particular date is that if we were separate for 2 years then there's a chance of him for filing a divorce.If he wishes to do that what are the steps i need to take before he can do this?Because i wish to live with my husband forever and i don wish to go against my tradition (by getting married 2nd time etc)..what do i need to do if they proceed with some legal action and the counter step from my side.Are the mails which were sent by me VALID if i need to process them in court?

Me and my b/f live together for 2 years and now want to get married (we can get married anytime whenever it's the best time for me to get the greencard easiest&fastest). My b/f right now is the permanent resident. He already applied for the US citizenship (in Jan09) and just went to the fingerfrint on Feb 17,09. Me and my b/f prefer that i don't have to leave the US while i'm waiting for the greencard because we will open the business here together after my opt expires. Here are the questions that would like you all to help;       1) Will the date of marriage (i mean marry before & after my b/f becomes US citizen) affect my greencard  application processing time?       2) should we get married as soon as possible or it's better to wait until my b/f becomes the citizen ... which way is better to faster the process of getting greencard?      3) In case that we get married before my b/f becomes citizen, should we file form I-130 right after the marriage or wait until he becomes the citizen?      4) In case that my b/f becomes the citizen before my OPT expires and then file the I-130 for me, will the USCIS give me the permission to wait for the greencard application process legally in the US? Or i have to go back my country to wait?         We are afraid that my b/f wouldn't become the citizen before my OPT expires, so i would have to leave the US and wait outside the US for a year or more than that...Is there any ways to help?      Thank you so muchhh

I feel sorry with all my heart that she has to go through such a terrible terminal illness knowing that she will no longer be alive. But dont you think that every pesron with terminal illness deserves to get the same treatment. Why is she different from others, We have so many excellent and kind people in this world who cannot afford to pay for their treatment but Jade gets everything she wants. My uncle and my grandparents died from cancer, my granddad died in front of me when i was 13, it was terriblt, i will never forget it. My granddad served his country in World War but when he was diagnosed with cancer noone wanted to know, he had very little help. Is it fair or unfair. I think if one person gets all attention then there should be some sort of way of making other special too, others who might have to go through those illnesses on their own. Thank you for opinion!

20090222132158AAyiOJg	Politics & Government;Politics	When you say "left", what do you mean?	If you use it as an insult or derogatory term keep your opinions to yourself, if you intend to answer rationally read on:   I've noticed a disparity between two camps, one uses the term "left wing" to describe someone who is a liberal/progressive on social matters, i.e. abortion, gay marriage, immigration etc. (this seems to be the terms general usage in the USA)   There's also the definition in economic terms, i.e. left wing economic philosophies, namely socialism.      I'm not saying one is correct or not, but the term "left" seems to have become a very generic term in casual conversation, when someone just says "left" to you, or when you say it yourself, what connotations come to your mind first, a liberal democrat (ideology not UK party) or a socialist?

20090222131939AASCpUT	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	What do you think of my five point welfare reform plan?	I have a plan to get people off of welfare and back to work outlined here, tell me what you think.      1) Make everyone receiving welfare take a depo pevera(birth control) shot. You get off of the system, the shot wears off, and you have no kids while on welfare. Having kids isn't a right, it is a responsibility if you can't afford it don't take it on.  Get off of welfare the shot wears off.      2) Take away their right to vote, if you can't make good enough decisions to keep yourself off of welfare and not have kids you can't afford then surely you cannot make a decision on government, also you will not vote in people that just promise more social programs.  Get off of welfare get your right to vote back.      3) Make them preform community service for 15-20 hours/week with a big orange vest that says "WELFARE" on it. The normal motivations for a good life don't work, maybe a little shame will. Pick up trash on the side of the road and let everyone know you are a resource sucking parasite. I also want something back for my money. I work for mine and you don't work for mine. (taxes). If you get money from the government, you should work for them.      4) Drug test, include alcohol and tobacco, I am not paying for your 40oz or pack of cigarettes.  Come up positive your check dries up.      5) Instead of allowing them to buy whatever food they want with my tax money give them a palette of food that they have to prepare. Staples only, bread, flour etc things they have actually got to prepare, these people are lazy by nature so if they have to work to prepare food maybe they will get a job so they can eat what they want.      These people are just parasites that breed more parasites, we need to break the cycle by making it is uncomfortable as possible for them to live, instead of coddling them and keeping them in a comfort zone. To get them on their feet we need to get them off of their a$$.

The US is the only country in the world that has been constantly at war in the last 60 years.

This is the last paragraph:            All the segregation,black codes,literacy tests, and poll taxes eventually led to the civil rights movement.For 100 years African Americans had been living by black codes,poll taxes, and literacy tests.They were getting fed-up and angry with all the segregation.Since reconstruction hadn't actually worked,in 1960 people started the civil rights movement to give African Americans full rights and to abolish racial discrimination.There were numerous marches,rallies,boycotts, and strikes all wanting racial equality. The civil rights movement vowed to end not only race discrimination but,color discrimination as well.           OK so i thought maybe i could end it with saying something like "Now in the present African Americans are so equal that even our president is African American"      how can i word it though?

During the normal operation of my current job, I was recently assaulted physically by a member of the public with a beer can to the face. Police responded and reports and statements of witnesses on my behalf taken. Person was not located who threw the unopened can. This is the third time such has happened and I don't feel I can return to this job position. Company feels that if I don't like the risk, quit. What legal rights do I have, and Can I collect unemployment if I quit.      Yes, the position I hold has with it inherent risk. More now then when I first started.  I have been assaulted other times while performing my duties and have had one of those people jailed for assault. I have put in requests for different positions when there are other positions available within the company that involve less risk, but the boss feels he cannot afford to move me because I am so good where I'm at. (money maker)   I have seniority over 98% of the company workforce also, but it's not a union shop.  If I cannot be granted a different post with this company and my only option for personal safety is to quit, and file suit, on what grounds?  It's a small company, and I always felt that everyone was friends, now it may seem I was mistaken in placing my loyalty with them.

So now he wants nothing to do with the baby, and I want to keep it that way. I want him to be nothing more than a sperm donor. I want to make a contract with him that says I will never come after him for child support, as long as he gives up his rights to see her unless I allow it. I know for him to legally give up his rights I have to have someone ready to adopt her, and I can't sign away her rights for support from him. But the contract will be between me and him that says if he tries to see her with out my say so, he is then required to give me child support, or if I go after him for child support he has the right for custody. That way I know he has no rights unless he breaks the contract, and I know that later on if I find someone who wants to be her dad and is worth it, he can adopt her, and he will be the only father she ever knows. I am positive he will sign the contract. But I’m not sure if there is another way or if this will even work. Any ideas?

He has always been saying kind of strange things that made me feel uncomfortable. He would say that some day he was going to marry me some day or that I was his girlfriend, and as a 5-year-old this kind of scared me.    Anyway I had a private lesson this past summer and he was asking me very personal questions about my love life and telling me to dump my boyfriend for him. He told me that he was going to take me out on my 18th birthday when I'm legal. I told him to stop and i refused to answer. I tried to ignore him because I was just there to play tennis. Then he got this weird grin on his face and asked me if i was wearing underwear. I was, but he said "I don't think you are. If you were, you'd prove it to me" and then he tried to pull down my shorts but finally another one of his students showed up. He told me not to tell my parents or anyone. He is almost 40 and I am 17. I didn't tell my parents but I haven't been able to play tennis since even though I love it. I am terrified of this or something worse happening again. Was this sexual harassment? Should I have told my parents?

I got in into the car just to say hi to the other 3 more guys... While I was doing that he made a prank to me and he shot me with a BB gun (Airgun) to my arm..and another shots but the only one he got was to my arm...      Well after that I just walked away to my car and he called me to say sorry, but I didnt answer my phone...But my cousin saw them and he told me there is 2 covered polices that are following your friend and I was like yea right I dont think so...      Then they pulled out on the road...Then I went to my house... but on my way to my house in the traffic light next to walmart the road was closed my 6 polices cars.... and the guy that was being arrested and put on the floor was my old friend... then I just turned around and went home...       But I mean he's not a bad person, I know him since freshmen year... But I dont know why he could have been arrested by 6 police cars and by almost 8 police officers...      Could he have done something else... Or was it because they saw him shooting at me with the BB gun or Airsoft gun... OR maybe he was doing something before and thats why police stopped him

20090222133756AAg6XIf	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Was I arrested or not?	I tried to post this once, so sorry if this was a duplicate.      I was involved in an altercation with 2 people at a location in Michigan that has premises film (but I am not sure how much or how good).      I was certainly not innocent, and both parties were engaged in arguing, etc. I instigated the physical contact (a push out the door) when the second person was running up behind me, and I feared that this was going to become a 2 vs 1. The first person and I exchanged some punches, and after we separated, I was struck by a blunt object by the second individual, and I hit back on him after that as well.      The police arrived, and put me in the car, uncuffed, and asked my version of the story. I gave that and my ID. They also got a witness version of what had happened. They asked what I got hit with, and where, but I really didn't know if it was only one hit and where since it happened so fast. The witness confirmed the object.      I was carted away in an ambulance, fixed up, and when the police officer arrived at the scene, he said "The Prosecutor will review the store footage", and that was all.      Seeing as I was not cuffed, brought to the station, nor was I even cited with any formal ticket...was the officer referring to something I need to worry about or is he referencing the video to determine if I was assaulted with a weapon of sorts? I was also given a "Crime Victim Care" brochure at the hospital.      So, what is your take on this? Am I going to get arrested at some other point, or was I already arrested and now the PA is going to hang me later?

20090222134414AA0TSdX	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Where corporate loyalties should lay?	An employee’s sense of ownership and pride in the company are valuable assets which are difficult to quantify monetarily, but are assets which carry very strong benefits, benefits which can manifest them selves monetarily over the scope of the employee’s time with the company. Employee moral and relationship with the company is an aspect of valuation that is not captured by current accounting methodologies and therefore is not currently valued as evidenced by current market trends through the breakdown of employer/employee loyalty towards one another. In fact this sort of superficial level of interaction has become more and more prevalent thought all aspects of our society and is a fundamental value, that of community, which will need to be addresses as our companies continue to globalize. The question of, “With whom does a company’s loyalty lie?” with it’s stockholders or with it’s community, and how to balance the two in order to achieve a sustainable business and employee standard of living will become a more pressing topic in the years to come.

My son, a sixteen-year-old minor, had a friend who wanted to sell him, my son, his car. The car is an older, beat-up Chevrolet Corsica, which my son purchased for $295. He purchased this car without my consent and without telling me first--he was excited to buy a car.      After he brought it home, I told him he made a bad decision--the sound system was stripped, the paint is chipped, the radiator leaks, there is oil everywhere under the hood, the car makes a horrible noise when started, some lights  are missing, etc. My son later said, "I should give it to a homeless man so he can  have a home", if that tells you anything about its condition.      Regardless of the car's condition, I do not believe my son has the legal ability to purchase the car without my consent. Both my son and I have agreed that the car should be "re-traded" for the money. The boy has said he does not  want  to and that their transaction is legally binding although I do not think this is the case.      If I were to take this to small claims court, would the judge agree that the $295 should be  repaid and  the car returned? I like in Kansas, by the way.

20090222144026AANmYfL	Politics & Government;Politics	At this moment, would you prefer having a Republican or Democrat Governor in your state?	(Arnie doesn't count. He is having a serious identity crisis. lol)       http://www.realclearpolitics.com/article...       Govs. Granholm, Pawlenty, Rendell, and Sanford on "Fox News Sunday"      Governor Sanford, South Carolina has the third highest unemployment rate in the country. Under the package, you would get $8 billion that the White House says would create 50,000 jobs in your state, and yet you say you may not accept all of the money, including some of the money for unemployment benefits. Why not?      SANFORD: Two reasons. One, at times it sounds like the Soviet grain quotas of Stalin's time -- X number of jobs will be created because Washington says so. And that's not the way that jobs get created.      I would secondly say what we are looking at is, in many cases, the money that would come to our state comes with substantial strings attached that, frankly, undo a lot of what we're trying to do at the state level.      Take, for instance, unemployment benefits. What we would be required to do would be, for the first time, increase the level of benefit for part-time workers. In other words, right now, it's full- time workers -- increase it to part-time workers.      But this same fund had to go to the feds this fall to borrow $140 million, has come back to ask another $170 million from the fed. And so it becomes somewhat circular. We can't pay for the benefits already in the program, but to get the stimulus money, we've got to increase the program's size and scale.      WALLACE: All right.      Governor Granholm, unemployment in Michigan is 10.6 percent, which is the highest in the nation. And you say you're going to take every one of the $7 billion coming to your state. Why is Governor Sanford wrong?      GRANHOLM: Well, this, to me, is not about philosophical theory. This is about real people who, through no fault of their own, are laid off because of a recession. They need to be able to put food on the table.      So you better believe I'm going to take every dollar that is coming to Michigan. And if my colleagues here in Minnesota and South Carolina don't get -- don't use theirs, I'm going to be first in line to say for my people, for our citizens, to put people to work and to make sure that they can survive through this, I'll take their dollars, too.      WALLACE: Governor Pawlenty, you have criticized -- I'll get to you in a minute, Governor Sanford.      You have criticized the bill that Congress passed, but you say you are going to accept all of the $4 billion in the stimulus package that Minnesota would get.      Why don't you share your Republican colleague Governor Sanford's concerns about the long-term negative effects of this spending?      PAWLENTY: Well, I do. I don't like this bill, but it is now the law. It's not the bill that Mark and I would have crafted, but it's now our responsibility and opportunity to try to implement it.      In Minnesota's case, we are a major net subsidizer of the federal government, and that's unlike some other states. For every dollar we send in, we only get 72 cents back. So we're paying the bill either way. We're going to take our share of the money.      We also don't have some of the same impediments as some other states. In the unemployment area, this is a time to try to help unemployed people, and most of the enhancements that the federal government is requiring the states to undertake on this bill we did years ago. So it doesn't impinge us or hurt us in that regard in Minnesota.      WALLACE: Governor Rendell, Pennsylvania gets the most money of all your four states from the stimulus package, $16 billion.      Weigh in on this argument, but also, you say that you're not sure that this money is actually going to fix the economy. Why not?      RENDELL: Well, in the long term, I don't think anybody can be sure that any single thing is going to fix the economy. It has to be a number of things, attacking on all different sides of the problem. But I do think it will create jobs.      I mean, one thing I think we all agree on -- and I hesitate to speak for all of us -- is that the infrastructure dollars do produce jobs. There's no question about that. You fix a bridge and people have to work on the bridge.      You fix a bridge and orders have to go out, hopefully, to Pennsylvania, or South Carolina, or Michigan, Minnesota companies, factories that desperately need orders -- steel, concrete, asphalt, lumber. So there are aspects of this plan that are definitely job producers.      And in Pennsylvania, I think we'll net about the same amount of jobs we've lost since August, 60,000 or 70,000 jobs, by the time we're done. So there are elements of this that are terrific.      It's not all stimulus. I mean, part of it is relief, and I think Tim said something that was very important. I'm not sure that we can, over the long run, cope with the higher unemployment compensation standard that this mandates for states, but I don't care.      My people are suffering. My people ar

From the Fox News Network, some governorss are refusing the stimulus money.      I live in Louisiana and my opinion is that Jindal and Barbour are right.

Jindal says on NBC's Meet the Press.  In my thoughts that this money is just a way to delay problems that are already happening, not a solution.

20090222144020AAtIxiP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	In the state of TN if a man starts paying his child support does he automatically get to see his child?	Me and my ex were never married and he has never helped to take care of our child at all. He has made threats against my person and also to take my child away from me and I would never see him again. However, I cant prove the threats. He has a bad family history of everything. He told me that he had heard that if he starts paying his child support that he would get to see our son every other weekend and one day a week overnight. Our son is 19 months old. I have a lawyer who has told me that this is not true but I just want a second opinion.
20090222144034AA1h4YF	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can the police enter my backyard due to a noise complaint?	We had a couple of people over for a BBQ that lasted pretty late in the evening. We weren't being very loud (in my opinion) but we have had an ongoing problem with a neighbor that complains about anybody and anything. The police entered my backyard (a total of three) and ask me to step outside. I walked outside and they asked me for my I.D. which I provided. They told me that they were there due to a noise complaint. I asked them if they though we were being to loud and they took a few moments (looking perplexed) and replied yes a little bit. They asked us to maybe take the party inside. We were in an enclosed lanai. I told them "we were inside". They then asked me a few questions and I drew the line when they asked me where I worked. I told them that it was none of their business. I then asked them that I would like to file a complaint against the neighbor that called them out and possibly themselves. This was probably the 5th or 6th time the cops have responded due to a noise complaint and the 1st time they actually said we were being a little loud. I asked them to provide me with some identification and they refused. It was at this time I told them that if they couldn't provide me with I.D. to leave my property (which they did). So I am wondering if they couldn't hear us from the front yard, does this give them probable cause to enter my property? Do they need to know were I work in this instance? Do they need to provide I.D.? Did they violate my right in not allowing me to file a complaint against my neighbor? I love and totally respect the police departments of our great nation. But in this occasion, I felt a little violated and am embarrassed that we can't host a little get together without the police being called out. There were 5 of us on the lanai not 20 or 30. We were being respectful. None of our other neighbors ever complain. There are neighbors that even live closer than our problematic neighbor. Does anyone one have any advice on this matter?
