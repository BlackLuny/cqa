What you can do is unplug the computer and then open up the computer and unplug all the power cables from the motherboard and all the devices. Then, plug the computer back in. What this is doing is isolating the power supply from the rest of the computer. If the power supply turns on, check the fans on the power supply, if they are not spinning, then your power supply is getting too hot and turning off. If it doesn't turn on, then replace the power supply. <br>  If it turns on and all is working fine, then what you should do is turn off, unplug and then connect the mother board back in. Then turn it back on. The computer won't boot up, but you should see on the screen if it boots the BIOS. Then, keep connecting one thing at a time until you figure out what is causing the problems. <br>  If it don't boot at all with just the motherboard, then its either your MB or RAM or a card on the MB. At that point, you will have to pull out the cards and put them back in one at a time.<br>  <br>  I had a modem go bad and it would keep my computer from booting up.

Ls5KpZdxaa	Mini laptops as as good as the large ones. Most of the the mini laptops have 1GB RAM and 160GB hard drive and all other features as wi-fi, usb ports and other general stuff. Though you won't get a DVD drive built in, you can always buy an external usb drive. I use 2 mini laptops Acer Aspire one and Asus eeepc. You may have some trouble with the keyboard as it is approx 30% smaller. Rest this is a best buy if you are on the move and prefer light weight stuff. It will server you all the regular document editing, internet, office applications, standard games, movies, music, even software and web programming. Do check for specs before you buy. Get atleast 1GB RAM and approx 160GB hard drive. Good luck :)|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Netbooks are very good for Internet BROWSING not so much for playing online. They are not that good for MS Office ( screen size, cramped keyboard ).

Well, the differences all come down to three big things:<br>  <br>  1) Screen size - Easy, 8 inch, 9 inch, or 10 inch?<br>  <br>  2) Keyboard size - Look at ratings for a specific model to see if the keyboard size sounds good. Also, 10 inch is usually going to have a better keyboard.<br>  <br>  3) Battery life - MAKE SURE YOU GET AN ATOM PROCESSOR. Some older models have a Celeron, this cuts the battery life in half, at least. So as long as you get an atom processor, the battery life comes down to how many cells the battery has. More the better. For specifics, you can look up the battery life ratings for the model.<br>  <br>  So, consider those factors. The EEE PC line by Asus has the best models in my opinion, as I've had 2 different ones and they were both beautiful. There's a model number comparison in my source.<br>  <br>  May I suggest:<br>  1) 10 inch, SUPERB battery life, GREAT keyboard: The EEE PC 1000HA <a href="http://www.amazon.com/10-Inch-Netbook-Processor-Storage-Battery/dp/B001GIPSA2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236272069&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/10-Inch-Netbook-Pr...</a><br>  <br>  2) 9 inch, good battery, decent keyboard: The EEE PC 900HA <a href="http://www.amazon.com/900HA-8-9-Inch-Netbook-Processor-Storage/dp/B001GIPSAM/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236272190&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/900HA-8-9-Inch-Net...</a><br>  <br>  Number 1 is $350, 2 is $300.

vK53Hh8naa	In any coding environment, you always make your code easy to read. Its also important, specially in web situations, that you consider your target platform. X/HTML can be very picky about browsers so making sure that your site will look as clean as possible on a variety of browsers is something you should keep in mind. Try to stay away from in-line styles: use CSS as much as possible to allow for later edits without rummaging through all your code.<br>  <br>  HTML coding can be tricky and althought there are many hacks and loopholes to getting the desired result, you should always try to get your results through a standarized method. You should also choose the right document type for your web sites: browsers render X/HTML based on these declarations. Hence, choosing the right declaration (X/HTML, Transitional/Strict, etc) will have an impact on how browsers render your code and how uniform your website is when viewed from different browsers. Last but not least, stick to the declaration rules. X/HTML hacks can be helpful but they restrict your audience by limiting the browsers.<br>  <br>  And as for the HTML tagging, well that's the definition. If you don't use tags in the correct manner, then you are no longer writing in HTML: you are tricking the browser into displaying content in a certain manner, which is otherwise known as HTML hacking.

Antworte ich halt allgemein:<br>  <br>  Für Video braucht es mindestens einen 2.0 flotten Rechner mit mind. 1024 Arbeitsspeicher. Er sollte sehr, sehr viel Platz auf der Festplatte haben und besser eine 2. Platte um nicht alles auf der HD des Betriebssystems zu machen. Videos bringen jeden Rechner zu keuchen! Daher muss man einen superschnellen mit viel Arbeitsspeicher und Festplatte haben. Au?erdem unbedingt die Platte defragmentieren, denn zuviel "suchen" l?sst ihn wom?glich auch hei? laufen. <br>  <br>  Wenn Hardware (Board, bzw. Elemente darauf) alt sind, dann mag der Rechner hei? werden. Aber es kann auch an der "überbeanspruchung liegen". "H?ngen bleiben" bedeutet, dass der Rechner irgendwo nicht weiterkommt, bzw. so lange braucht, dass man denkt er k?me nicht weiter. <br>  <br>  Also, erstmal aufr?umen und Platz schaffen. Ich mache z.B. mind. einmal im Jahr den Rechner platt, was ihn super schnell macht! Aller Schrott und Programmreste sind dann weg!

Check the tab to see if it's been moved into the locked position.  Also, some cards require the tab to be halfway between locked and unlocked for them to be writable - weird, but worth a try.<br>  <br>  This may or may not work, but if you have a camera that takes microsd cards, maybe you can format the card in the camera.

However you say you have PowerPoint so can you not use that program for your uses, or even Word which has the same shapes.  You say you cannot rotate, though I cannot understand why. All you need do is click on tghe shape to select it, then put your mouse pointer on the green circle at the top, your mouse pointer changes to a curled arrow and just drag your mouse round to rotate.  If then you really need to use Paint for some reason, copy and paste in.

A class is a blueprint to make an Object. A class is not an Object until it is loaded into the computer's memory. When we have an Object, we gain values, states, and methods. Any time, in code, you see a word() with parenthesis, that is a method(). It means to java, while reading this list, branch at the method() -- do that block -- and come back to this point, the line after the method() and keep going. So, when you see nested stuff like your question, it means do several operations starting with the inner-most parenthesis first.<br>  <br>  How do we get an Object? from the class's constructor...<br>  <br>  class Car {<br>  int numWheels;<br>  // constructor<br>  public Car( int howmanywheels ) {<br>  numWheels = howmanywheels;<br>  }<br>  // can have more than one constructor<br>  // this one has zero args<br>  public Car() {<br>  }<br>  note that the constructor has the same name as the class, but with the word 'public' and no word 'class'. Look at sample code.<br>  // a method<br>  public void subtractWheel( int howmany ) {<br>  numWheels = numWheels - howmany;<br>  }<br>  <br>  now, we need another class with a main(). A class with main() is the launch pad of an application...<br>  <br>  class WreckingYard {<br>  // no constructor, I don't need one<br>  public static void main( String[] args ) {<br>  Car pinto = new Car( 3 ); // now I have an Object<br>  // pinto to the Human, the Computer has it as<br>  [@FF95Fx001Car[pinto:3]<br>  I can now use the properties of the Object<br>  System.out.println( pinto.numWheels );<br>  pinto.subtractWheel( 2 );<br>  <br>  So, an Object is a fancy array, that's all. The Human gets to use words to call or set the information.<br>  <br>  Finally, java has primitives: byte, short, int, boolean, etc. A primitive holds a value ONLY. Different types so the computer's memory is used efficiently. For instance, an int uses 16 switches in RAM to store the value.<br>  <br>  The Object Integer is different from the primitive int in that Integer has method()s to convert from String to number, to other number types and so forth.<br>  <br>  u r welcome to email thru my Profile button. this answer has been long enough.|`|FDEHTG6uaa	Recursion: a method that calls on itself.<br>  i.e. public void lol(int lol){<br>  bla bla bla;<br>  lol (3);<br>  }<br>  <br>  Array: a variable that holds many values of the same type.<br>  ArrayList: an array where you can manipulate the length. Normal array you can't. You're stuck with whatever you declared at the start.<br>  <br>  Converting from one to another type of data is necessary because of many things, with one being data validation. Also, converting allows for type-specific methods to be used. For example, from int to string allows for substring() method, which is used to cut up the string.<br>  <br>  integer is the name of the class. int is the name of data type.<br>  <br>  A lot of parenthesis is because of java's syntax.

Assuming you still have windows install disc, you will then have to inter the computer's BIOS by pressing the DELETE (or F1, F12, or F11) key repeatedly right after you press the power button. then you should get a blue screen with a menu on it. look for an option that says something to the effect "advanced set up" not to be confused with "advanced chipset features". one you are there, set your CD drive to boot first, then any other drives like floppy or CD, and set your HDD too boot last. then just pop in the windows install CD and restart, and follow the instructions that will pop up. if you dont already have the install disc, you will have to buy a windows operating system online.

88950a422926fd42558e591d50a87e71aa	Yes there are comptability requirements, you can't just throw any CPU into your system - first it will need to be the correct socket type - secondly your motherboard will need to have support for the particular CPU - just because the socket type is the same does not necessarily mean the board will support that CPU - in some cases the CPU will be supported but a bios update may be required. PSU requirements shouldn't be much of a problem for just swapping a CPU in this case.<br>  <br>  So most importantly you need to be sure that your motherboard will be compatable with the new CPU - most board manufacturers will have this information available online, check whether or not a bios update wil be required for your mobo.<br>  <br>  The actual process of installing the new CPU will be fairly simple, you'll need to remove the current CPU heatsink which will be secured using either screws or pushpins - which will release if the pins are turned in the correct direction and lifted. <br>  <br>  You can then remove the CPU - for intel cpu there is a lever that secures the CPU that you'll need to unhook, not sure on AMD ones, you'll also need thermal grease to apply to the new CPU to ensure a clean connection between the CPU and the heatsink to maximise heat transfer -<br>   only a thin layer of thermal grease spread evenly with as smooth a surface as possible is required, the heatsink will need to be cleaned of any residual thermal compund before fitting, installing the CPU is simple enough - there is an arrow to one corner of the chip that will need to be matched with the socket on the mobo, after getting the CPU in place correctly you'll then need to carefully re-fit the heatsink being careful not to get any thermal grease onto any of the other components,|`|13b723f270d65c013797b5d13e3884adaa	you will need to know exactly what mobo you have and what chipset it is using.  You will need to know what socket it supports.  For example: amd socket am2...make sure to note not only socket compatibility, but also the electric compatibility, just because the socket is the same doesn't mean the new cpu you want will work. (though amd is pretty good about this) Once you are sure that your cpu will work for you and your mobo, pull out the old one, take some rubbing alcohol to clean off the thermal paste on the heatsink.  Then, apply some new thermal paste/grease (arctic silver) to the heatsink...just a bit should do, don't use too much.  Then line up pin 1 on the cpu with pin 1 on the socket and drop in.  Do not force it.  Then, pop the heatsink on.  Done.

Once you are satisfied that the drive is clean again, copy the important files to another drive.  Then you can put the hard drive back into the other computer and see if it boots.  If it doesn't, and if a repair install of Windows still won't fix the problem, then you have no choice but to format and reinstall.  You can copy the important files back to that drive after installation is complete.

Do the following to increase speed.<br>  <br>  Go to start then run and type in msconfig. Then ok.<br>  To control what boots up goto msconfig. There is a boot up tab check or uncheck the boxes, to disable or abel each item. Also because you disable an Item this does not prevent you from using anything you disable, it only prevents it from booting up when you start computer. If you want to use an Item you disable from booting up just click on it, and it will start. There are a few essentials you need when booting up, normally 4 or 5 plus virus and firewalls controls if you have them. I have an HP mine are PS2, REC GUARD, KBD, CCAPP. Just rember because when you don't boot it up it is still usable but you gain a lot of ram memory. Also you can call the manufacter and they will give you the esstials for booting up.

The best way to find these is by doing research.<br>  <br>  As laptop specs change often, it is good to get non-vendor/non-partisan/non-groupie information so you should do some checking on these review/guide sites to help fine tune your search.<br>  <br>  At each site, start by checking some models and then compare them with others (or against each other) by choosing different options using boxes and drop down menus to customize the search and get what you want in your laptop ( there is even a way on some of those sites to look by inputting the price you are willing to pay to minimize the impact on your wallet ).<br>  <br>  Your time will not be wasted (after all, you get all this from the comfort of your home) and you should find something to your liking and budget.<br>  <br>  Stop 01 here: <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr;snav" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/?tag=hdr...</a><br>  Stop 02 here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/products/computers/laptops.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/products/computer...</a><br>  Stop 03 here: <a href="http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?categoryId=3121" rel="nofollow">http://review.zdnet.com/filter/laptops?c...</a><br>  Stop 04 here: <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.notebookreview.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  But in the end, this is YOUR choice and you WILL have to live with it so Good Luck !|`|867evy6Faa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  I have the Acer and I do all those thing and the battery life is great.

cWuumdy7aa	Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, refers to computer components, devices, and recording media that retain digital data used for computing for some interval of time. Computer data storage provides one of the core functions of the modern computer, that of information retention. It is one of the fundamental components of all modern computers, and coupled with a central processing unit (CPU, a processor), implements the basic computer model used since the 1940s.<br>  <br>  In contemporary usage, memory usually refers to a form of semiconductor storage known as random access memory (RAM) and sometimes other forms of fast but temporary storage. Similarly, storage today more commonly refers to mass storage - optical discs, forms of magnetic storage like hard disks, and other types slower than RAM, but of a more permanent nature. Historically, memory and storage were respectively called primary storage and secondary storage.<br>  <br>  The contemporary distinctions are helpful, because they are also fundamental to the architecture of computers in general. As well, they reflect an important and significant technical difference between memory and mass storage devices, which has been blurred by the historical usage of the term storage. Nevertheless, this article uses the traditional nomenclature.|`|ecM7pdHwaa	Computer memory is usually meant to refer to the semiconductor technology that is used to store information in electronic devices. Current primary computer memory makes use of integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based transistors. There are two main types of memory: Volatile and Non-volatile.|`|TVzA5WE8aa	Computer Memory = RAM<br>  RAM is the memory that is present in your computer which it allows you to speed up your applications time and start up time. RAM is like a human adding more glucoses to the cell/brain so he could perform higher level and more intense works. Maximum amount of RAM in a computer/laptop is most likely 4GB.

The program the i use is called "NVU", it's a free program that you can use to build a sites and it generates the Html page for you in the source page. <br>  <br>  There are also a lot of free courses and videos online on how you can use this easy program. After you learn the NVU, you need to choose a niche you want to target doing some market research and selecting keywords you want to use.You then name your website, get a domain name, hosting account and FTP program to upload your pages to your site.<br>  <br>  You can learn how to build a site, but to be indexed by search engines is the hardest thing in the process. If your website template is not build a seach engin friendly (tags, meta tags, descriptions, keywords, titles), then your site will never show up in the search using the keywords.<br>  <br>  When you finish building your site you need to submit it to search engins and it take a lot of time to be indexed.<br>  <br>  The best way to start building a site is to buy a templates ready  and friendly to Search engins and all you have to do is open your template using NVU and start your page. You can start learning by using the template but you need to make a copy of it and have always the original safe in case you want  to use it again.<br>  The battle is not over yet, you need a marketing strategy to drive traffic to your site by means of articles, ads, exchange links and many more.. <br>  If you are a beginner or your goal is to make money then the easiest way to go are Blogs. You can start blogging in 10mn and it is also a casual place to express or review products and sevices  to make money. To do that you need to go to Clickbank and choose a product you want to promote using a link that you can put in your blog (review).The best and easy place to open a blog is at Blogger.com and you don't need a domain name or a hosting account.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to set-up a blog and become affiliate blogger there some good quality video tutorials you can watch and learn how to at, www.CreateBlogMakeMoneyBlogging.com , the video series shows how to set up a blog, do keywords research, open an account at Clickbank, how to link to the merchant  and a lot more. <br>  I hope this help and good luck.|`|5MUeFvh4aa	You can use one of the hosted CMS where all you need is to register and you'll have a website, e.g. FreeWebs or uCoz

There's no point if you have a monthly defrag scheduled.    There's just no reason to defrag weekly, unless you are constantly installing and uninstalling programs.  I mean, like every day.   Once a month is really more than most people need.  Once every two months is plenty for most of us.<br>  <br>  Also, I'll give another vote for Auslogics disk defrag.  It's MUCH better than the built in defrag utility.  <br>  <br>  Along with that, you should download and use Microsoft's page defrag.  It defrags the page file, which is very important.   Regular defraggers can't touch the page file, as Windows uses it for basic functions.  Since it's always in use, normal defraggers can't work on it.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	No, manual or even scheduled defrag is obsolete and a waste of time.

Theres  a lot of factors to take into account, but doesn't appear to be an unusual problem with that service speed to me Also be aware if you do a lot of downloading it is very likely that you have had your service capped. Its not just a treat they do that. A call to customer services will illiminate that possible problem though

88950a422926fd42558e591d50a87e71aa	It's hard to say for sure - could be a one off problem unless it's happenning all the time, crysis WH at very high settings puts a strain on even the fastest systems - with 2GB of RAM crysis will be using pretty all of the available system RAM so could be down to this. 60c is ok for a HD4870 nothing too bad about that - a CPU OC can cause problems with crysis i have found - it just doesn't like it when my CPU is OC'd - seems to be fine with GPU OC I OC my Sapphire 4870 to around 800 core 940 mem and crysis is fine with it. So if you are OC'ing your CPU that could be it, other than that could have just hit a part of the game where system resources were stretched to the limit or a windows process running in the background could have caused a crash.

H5iVq0fwaa	i think the there are 2 things that you need most that beats all free security softwares out there:<br>  1. windows installer<br>  2. a good backup software, i use acronis true image<br>  - i use acronis to backup the whole c drive. i keep this backup in an external harddrive. whenever my system gets infected or something goes wrong, i just reformat, reinstall windows and the acronis program, then restore my backup. everything will return to the way it was when you made your backup in less than 2 hours (depends on how big your c drive is; because of reformatting; 2 hours is based on my pc, which has a 160gb for a c drive).<br>  <br>  other free softwares i use:<br>  - internet options (control panel) to delete the files in the internet cache<br>  - disk cleanup (systems tools), also comes with windows<br>  - defragmenter (system tools)<br>  - revo uninstaller<br>  - spybot - search and destroy<br>  - spywareblaster<br>  - spywareguard<br>  - old version of yahoo antispy (this is free, but i dont think you can download it from yahoo; i just have a copy; bec i love storing old softwares; the new version does not do a complete scan)<br>  - learn how to use the hosts file to block known bad sites<br>  - ad aware<br>  - for my antivirus, i am using an expired account/ software of trrend micro antivirus version 2006. it has real time scanning, it does the job very well. but you just cannot update it automatically. but i know how to update it manually. i think using trend micro is alot better than using avg or eset.<br>  - i dont use a firewall, because it slows down my internet. i know it is unsecure. but i dont have any problem with it.<br>  - update windows and java using autopatcher.com - updating can make your pc less vulnerable<br>  - i set the ie pop up blocker to high, then make exceptions to the sites i frequently visit|`|oKcmJuzaaa	The first thing I always download and install after setting up a new PC is the antivirus software.

Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall.

It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly. Hope this helps
xVfjkTyuaa	Similar answer to those above. Most home routers will NOT bridge to each other via the wiresless. They are AP (Access Point), which means people connect to them with their wireless "Client". Think of it as a server (AP), and a PC (client) getting access to file shares.<br>  There are some units that will allow it, usually some form of access client unit, but it may not be a "transparanet bridge". I think Linksys has such a unit. But it's been a while since I looked at bridging with "home" routers with a wireless AP, it just was not easy to do. I ended up buying specific, wireless bridges/AP units, on Ebay and have my network bridged 400 feet at 54 mbps (only about 15mbps throughput). Some of these Ebay units are just about $100 a pop, but have higher power and full bridging mode as well as behaving as regular routers/AP if you want. Having a higher power AP helps even if you just want to use such a unit for a home wireless link, as the range is larger than the usual "box store" wireless routers you can buy. Though my link below shows the unit I use, I've seen others on Ebay that are similar with 4 port switches as well.<br>  Now, the only "gotcha" is that you have to be familiar with networking to set up a bridge. Based on your original question, I'm assuming you are not that familiar with bridging, so I would suggest asking around with your friends, etc. to see if anyone can help you.|`|DRXHYA2Zaa	not as far as i know, unless your router can RECIEVE wireless signals too, which is rare, if possible at all<br>  try looking for a two way router or something like that|`|c0lbscZdaa	You wouldn't bridge them, you'd create a route between them using the advanced routing settings, you will need to refer to your manual to see where you need to configure it, look for something called a routing table.

You will find them at <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/pdf/u2600.pdf..." rel="nofollow">http://unicode.org/charts/pdf/u2600.pdf....</a> .<br>  <br>  You can create an HTML character entity once you have the Unicode number of the character. For example, to create an HTML hexadecimal character entity, prefix &?#x to the number and place a semi-colon after it. So, BLACK SPADE SUITE is &?#x?2660; , WHITE HEART SUITE is ?&?#x2661; and so on. To create an HTML decimal character entity you instead prefix &?# to the decimal version of the Unicode identifier number. You can convert using a calculator or look up the name in <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/...</a> and find the pages, for example, <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/...</a> .<br>  <br>  Usually just typing in a name of the character or its hex code followed by the word “Unicode” in Goggle will bring up a number of articles that contain all sorts of information about the character.<br>  <br>  Many word processors and text editors have their own methods of inserting Unicode characters (as long as you know either the hexadecimal or decimal number of the character your want). Check the Help file.<br>  <br>  But you often have to have a font enabled in which the character exists (though many displayers will search for the character through all your fonts if it doesn’t exist in the font you are currently using).

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

Satellite is essentially DSL but you have a lag time between sending the request and the request actually reaching the satellite.  You get great download speed that way but for web surfing it isn't ideal. Though now you are sharing your bandwidth with other subscribers in your area either way so neither is really going to give you the full benefits of the connection you are paying for.|`|cMsC5a14aa	They both sux i pay $50 a month for twice the speed with a sattelite dish but its hell when it rains real hard|`|SsIE2iWXaa	This is actually a very complex question.

Section|`|1hciyvKdaa	My antivirus stops attacks from websites probably once a month. I ran a computer for almost 2 years with no antivirus, then it was completely full of trojans, redirects and viruses and quit working. My computer was trying to contact an offshore island, I would have to open many many windows so that I could surf. So someone was trying to do somwthing or gain info or somehing on my computer. It was kinda creepy. <br>   So I bought a new one and put on the newest norton antivirus. The thing is that any site can have something harmful on it and all you have to do is open the page, its not just opening emails with attachments that cause viruses and trojans.  Its worth buying, it helps keep your computer working longer.  Game sites are notorious for having issues to damage peoples computers, and if you search info on google, google cant control who is listed there. To me if you like your computer its cheaper to put in an antivirus then to pay someone to come look at why its not working now. You can go to microsofts site and do the free online computer check to see how your computers running and find out if its infected at all. You may not know things are being damaged, then you send a pic to a friend, and that pic has the virus n it, so now they too if their antivirus or mail client doesnt catch it, now their computer is going to be ruined too. IF your not going to run an antivirus, be kind and do not email people ever, its not fair to them.|`|unpkAJR1aa	it is extremely important. if u dont have an anti-virus u wont know that ur pc is being attacked by a virus or hacked and then the next day kaboom computer wont turn on that is why a pc needs an anti-virus.|`|HV4xq1JHaa	Go here: <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...</a><br>  <br>  It is totally free.

IE, being deeply woven into Windows, is a prime target, and makes using Firefox, with 'noScript' add on even more urgent.<br>   <br>  Use Firefox for general & everyday surfing needs, especially to sites you don't know anything about.

You may also need to restart your computer in order to see the router. <br>  <br>  <br>  Note: If you normally use a static IP address, you will have to reconfigure your internet connection to use DHCP. Go into the control panel and open your network connections. Edit the properties of your current network connection, and make sure that "Obtain an IP address automatically" is enabled. <br>  <br>  <br>  Connect to the router using your web browser by typing "http://192.168.1.1" into the URL address box. <br>  Leave the Username field blank, and enter the password "admin" to access your router when the login prompt appears. <br>  <br>  <br>  Note: You will notice immediately a list of menu options (Setup, Wireless, Security, etc.), and as you click on each of these submenus appear. This document will refer to a menu-submenu combination as Menu -> Submenu. <br>  <br>  <br>  Setup -> Basic Setup. In the "Internet Setup" section, choose "Static IP" from the drop down menu. Fill in the appropriate values that describe your network. (You don't need to change anything in the optional section just below that.) <br>  <br>   <br>  In the "Network Setup" section, you should at least set your timezone to Eastern Time, although you may make changes to the DHCP server as well if you anticipate more than 50 users connecting to your network at once. <br>  <br>   <br>  Wireless -> Basic Wireless Settings. Set the Wireless network mode to "Mixed" if you would like both B and G clients to be able to connect to your network. Otherwise you can just select "B-only". The "Wireless Network Name" will be provided by CNS. Make sure that you disable "Wireless SSID Broadcast" to give a little extra security. <br>  <br>   <br>  Wireless -> Wireless Security. CNS recommends that you use at least WEP based security to protect your network. Choose WEP from the drop down menu and then select "128 bits 26 hex digits" for the "WEP Encryption". Enter a passphrase into the "Passphrase" field and click "Generate" to generate the corresponding HEX keys. Distribute key 1 to your users as the WEP key for your network. <br>  <br>   <br>  Wireless -> Wireless MAC Filter. CNS also recommends that you use a MAC address list to filter access to your network. Click the "Edit MAC Filter List" and add all the MAC addresses that are going to be accessing your network. Any time a new user requires access, you will have to add them to this list. <br>  <br>   <br>  IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure that you add the MAC address of the computer you are using to set up your router first, before enabling this filter. Otherwise you will be unable to access the router and will have to reset the router. If you do have to reset the router because you have locked yourself out, there is a small reset button on the back of the router that will reset the router. <br>  <br>  <br>  Once the appropriate MAC addresses have been added, "Enable" the filter, and choose the option "Permit only PCs listed to access the wireless network".  <br>  Administration -> Management. You should make sure you change your password on this screen. "admin" is not a secure password! Also, you should disable "Remote Router access" so that your router cannot be configured from outside your network. UPnP is a protocol that opens ports in your firewall on the fly, and can post a security threat. We recommend that you disable this, but if you are running applications like MSN video chat, you may have to have this enabled. <br>  <br>   <br>  Administration -> Log. If you would like to keep a log of connections to your network, enable the logging here. <br>  <br>   <br>  That's it! You should be on the air!
12Aifvf4aa	Not sure what you are after here, but will have a stab at it. If an organisation stores any info on people, it would need to meet the Data Protection Act. The info should be stored securely whether it is paper-based or electronically. The organisation should have an access to information policy. Anyone who has information stored about them has access to it on request. The information should not be given to third parties unless there are criminal implications and the courts demand it, or it is with the consent of the person themselves.<br>  That is why there are prosecutions when laptops with peoples personal information are left lying about and are taken.<br>  There are any number of good models about storage of information out there.

Xi8LpZC0aa	What Is a Trojan horse?<br>  A Trojan Horse is full of as much trickery as the mythological Trojan Horse it was named after. The Trojan Horse, at first glance will appear to be useful software but will actually do damage once installed or run on your computer.  Those on the receiving end of a Trojan Horse are usually tricked into opening them because they appear to be receiving legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.  When a Trojan is activated on your computer, the results can vary. Some Trojans are designed to be more annoying than malicious (like changing your desktop, adding silly active desktop icons) or they can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on your system. Trojans are also known to create a backdoor on your computer that gives malicious users access to your system, possibly allowing confidential or personal information to be compromised. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Really a trojan, once installed, can do pretty much anything it wants to do.<br>  <br>  In fact, I wouldn't be too confident that your antivirus software deleted it. People who create malware removal software can remove only what they can find, and malware writers can be pretty tricky at hiding traces of their malware.<br>  <br>  The only way to be sure the malware is gone is to reinstall.<br>  <br>  I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it's the truth.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. It's the only way to know the trojan is completely gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #3 and #4.|`|n4tPArAAaa	destroys it<br>  it once did it to my computer|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Trojan Horses<br>   (or Backdoors) have been in the news just recently, the term probably sounds familiar to you. But perhaps you’re not quite sure what a Trojan Horse is and what damage it is capable of doing to your system. Trojan Horses, of which there are now more than one thousand in circulation (including modifications and variants), are a relatively new and probably the most dangerous strain  that have appeared in recent times. They also threaten to overwhelm systems that only run anti-virus applications and firewalls as a means of combating the threat. Today's Trojans as they are commonly referred to as, have now attained such a degree of sophistication that they pose a real threat to any user who hasn't taken adequate precautions to protect their data., by the way trojan horses arent viuses as they dont self replicate.,|`|BQS2bVjOaa	For all the info you will need on PC parasites, malware, spyware and Trojan viruses, you should check out: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pcthreat.com/removers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcthreat.com/removers.html</a><br>  <br>  Download the FREE infection scanner - and then follow the detailed instructions provided, on how to rid your system of the PC parasites embedded within.

If you have a pipe that is 10 inches wide and are only have say 2 inches of water going through it would not affect it if you cut that pipe down to half it's size at 5 inches.

HXW4i5Ajaa	First you need to understand cricket - you kneed to know the structure of the game, and how the scoring works. Once you think you have it, you can think about what data you will need to track. You will also need to think about what you want to get out of the program at the end - do you want to get an almost blow by blow report - a stats analysis of how many balls a batsman faced, how many runs he scored by running instead of boundaries etc, which fielders took most catches.<br>  <br>  How do you want the user interface to work? There is a thought that input could easily be done by just hitting a key for each ball - full stop on no score (or dot ball) a number for a score, W for a wicket, but what would you use for wide? No Ball? on taking a wicket it could open a dialog for how the wicket was taken - caught, bowled, stumped etc. You would also need some dialog at the end of each over to identify the new bowler (if a change). It would be easy (most of the time) to track which batsman is on strike from the runs scored, but what about when a batsman is run out - have they crossed? Who now has strike? Were any runs scored before the run out?<br>  <br>  So first thing, is what do you want to get out of it?|`|9XLJBU7haa	Following on from Paul's excellent thoughts on scoring it you need to design the Java classes.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have several classes:<br>  Player - this has details of runs/catches<br>  <br>  I suspect you don't want to make batsman a seperate class because every player could go to bat (from my limited memory of cricket).<br>  <br>  You probably want a team class with a list of batsman as an attribute.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how you would model the runs/wickets though.<br>  <br>  Looking ahead you may want to write the data to a database so you can keep track of player's progress. This is worth thinking about as it could affect your design.<br>  <br>  Good to see you are learning about databases.<br>  You may want to look at Hibernate in the future.<br>  <br>  Essentially it lets you create Java objects, modify their values using their methods and then use a save method.<br>  The save method then writes the data to a database table.<br>  <br>  It needs some prep work to setup but it would be an advanced feature to use if you were looking for a clever project.<br>  <br>  You might want to read about the concepts so you can bear it in mind when you design your classes.<br>  <a href="http://hibernate.org/" rel="nofollow">http://hibernate.org/</a><br>  <br>  Hibernate is one of the current hot technologies so it may be worth learning if you are looking to go into Java/DBs in the future.

1F6KJt0oaa	We need more information to really diagnose the problem.  There are a number of problems that can range from easy to complex to fix.  The main thing is if the computer is new then it is probably still under warranty.  I would start there.  If not then check with the website of the manufacturer there may be a way to service it.  To put it into prospective though it can cost as much as $60 just to diagnose a problem with your laptop which will roll into the repair usually but the repairs start at much higher because of the complexity of opening the laptop case.  Newegg only has 3 options for external drives for over 100 dollars meaning that all the others range from $50 to $100.  It is likely that the part for your laptop will be at least that and then you will have to pay labor.  So basically if it is under warranty then do that if not get an external.  You can get a slim design for under $75 which won't affect portability much and if you have a bag (if you don't have a bag you need one anyway) then the point is moot.|`|FK0tfWlXaa	If the lens is worn out you can't really fix that. You'll need to replace the entire unit. So there's 2 ways around this the cheapest method is get a usb ext drive they're really cheap. Other option of course internal they cost more because they are design for the housing of that brand.<br>  <br>  It will probably be smarter to get a external for one reason laptop are getting cheaper and soon or later you'll be replacing yours eventually so no point of spending to much.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|Vy3QlUA9aa	Try to get one of those DVD drive head cleaners.  If this doesn't work, then u may have to replace it or get an external DVD drive for ~$50, but ur lap tap will not be compact and portable anymore since u have to carry the External drive along with it which also requires external power source.<br>  <br>  Goof Luck cleaning it up.

What i would do is disable the Firewall and turn it on right after i finish intalling any proram i want. It is very important to enable your firewall back. If your anti-virus comes with it's own Firewall, then it's ok to leave the Windows firewall off.<br>  As far as unistalling the Windows Defender, i find it strange that you're being asked that, just make sure the anti-virus you are getting is from a legitimate source.To be on the safe side i always go with big names like Mcafe. They will never ask you to unistall the Windows Deffender and there is no e-mails to follow-up on the installation.<br>  Very strange e-mail you got.. watch.|`|wFRuecKwaa	No, you don't have to uninstall windows defender, it is not a antivirus software.|`|663TMV9kaa	no,keep win defender and uninstall the other anstivirus and keep on updating the defender|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	I don't think windows defender will cause any problems, it does nothing, so you can keep it.|`|AA11435892	Windows defender just stops working if you install something else over it.

These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry.

LeBp1gBcaa	X11 is the window system. Gnome is a desktop environment. The difference is that Gnome works through X11. Gnome and X11 run on Linux, though, not Windows.<br>  <br>  Basically, X11 is what displays everything. It's the graphical shell that connects you to the operating system. None of the applications you run ever send anything directly to the screen - they need to tell X11 what they want to display and let it do the work for them.<br>  <br>  X11 draws and moves windows and responds to input from the keyboard and mouse. That's pretty much it. Everything else is taken care of by the desktop environment. What that means is that the look and feel of the windows and the way those windows behave are all decided by which desktop environment you're using (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc.).<br>  <br>  The desktop environments all have their own graphics libraries (reusable chunks of code) that they use, along with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) which allow programmers to use those libraries when they create GUI applications. This way programmers don't have to recreate commonly used functions and elements from scratch, and the whole operating system has a more standardized look.<br>  <br>  OS X more or less works the same way. Quartz Compositor (the window system) uses a more complicated method of rendering than X11 does, but when you get down to the basics it's pretty much the same thing. OS X also includes X11, though, in case you want to run Linux apps.<br>  <br>  Windows is a little bit different. I'm not sure exactly how they structure the window system, but from what I can tell they pretty much just combined the window system and the desktop environment into an all-encompassing GUI shell. You'd have to ask a Windows expert to explain it to you (I'm more a Mac/Linux person).

zorYTX59aa	I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

And, Firefox version 2 is likely the latest version for your older version of Ubuntu Linux.<br>  <br>  When you try to get the update from the Mozilla website, you get a "Tarball" with a ".tar.gz" file extension.  It hasn't been "Ubuntified", meaning there may be other dependent files needed to make it run properly under Ubnuntu.<br>  <br>  So, delete the Tarball and just make sure you are installing all Ubuntu Updates when available.  I would recommend an upgrade to version 8.10 of Ubuntu.|`|HizAP9Z8aa	Do you know what version of Ubuntu you are running?

It is an LTS release, which means it will be updated for 3 years.  8.10 is a great release, but if you are going to update, it might be worth waiting until 9.04 comes out in April, which has 18 months of updates. (like all non-LTS releases)  Until it comes out, though, you will be protected with updates for 7.10<br>  <br>  BTW, version numbers in Ubuntu mean year and month.  So 7.10 is the October 2007 release.|`|1947cdfe7aa2b141eaece74b1a953c56aa	Which version of Ubuntu do you have? Newer versions (8.04 onwards) come with Firefox 3 installed.

They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.download.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/</a> I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly.

75nbESJUaa	Since you already have Windows, that's good (if you wanted to keep it). The only hard part will be identifying the new partition you want to put Linux, which is really 2-partitions, Linux wanting a swap partition. So, fire up LiveCD and use the DiskPartition to look at the partitions. Make darn sure you know which is Windows. Quit, click the Install Ubuntu icon. In less than a half hour you will have a dual boot machine. When you go Linux, Ubuntu will want to upgrade parts of the Linux.<br>  <br>  And, u know, after a while, I formatted the whole drive, made a new 40 meg partition and made a single-boot.

t5sYXwSqaa	There is no easy answer to this question as numerous things can make your computer slow. One program that you can try is Advanced Systemcare3 which is a free program that will do numerous things to your computer that a novice would find difficult to do. It will optimise your system, defrag if necessary, get rid of spyware, optimise RAM, clean registry, delete temp files etc. plus a lot more. If this does not work you may need to look further. Anti virus can make your computer run very slowly. Spyware is another culprit. You can run malwarebytes antimalware that is a good program for getting rid of adware/spyware. You can also run several registry cleaners like JV16 powertools, Glarysoft Reg Cleaner, CCleaner. It is also very useful to get rid of programs on the HD that you do not use and stop any programs that you do not need on the start up menu. Updating all your drivers can also speed up performance. Lastly and probably most importantly increasing the amount of RAM you have in the machine can significantly increase computer speed. Hope this helps. Good luck.

There are two things to keep in mind when creating a website: Domain name and host.<br>  <br>  A bit of background:<br>  <br>  A website is actually a HTTP server hosted by a machine. When a person requests a website from said server, the server responds with information that is then handled by a browser in the form of X\HTML, XML, plain text, or binary data (Images, programs, zips, etc). Servers can also have server-side scripting, which is how many websites today function (PHP, ColdFusion, etc). An HTTP server can exist on any machine. Windows XP Professional comes with an HTTP server, also know as IIS. Mac OS X also comes with an integrated server, know as Apache. And Linux, the leader in website hosting, uses Apache most of the time. Clients connect to these HTTP servers through IPs: a sort of network address. These look like a phone number: 209.85.171.100 ( http:\\209.85.171.100 is Google). These however are difficult to remember; this is where the domain name comes in. Domain names serve as aliases for an IP. Yahoo.com for example is actually an IP address that belongs to the Yahoo! HTTP server. Simple, right?<br>  <br>  So how much does it cost?<br>  <br>  Well, it depends on how much traffic your website will have, and what name you would like. If your website will have just one kind of traffic, you and family, the YOU can host your website with any of the HTTP servers mentioned above. Most server setups will modify your system to accept connections but if your IP looks something like 192.168... (use ipconfig from the command prompt to find out) then you need port forwarding on port 80: <a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow">http://portforward.com/</a> . If your traffic will be heavier, then you should consider outsourcing the hosting, which can range from free to 100s of dollars. Your website name is also optional. If you will be hosting your website from your home, then you can either access your website simply by typing in the WAN IP of your home, or you can get a Dynamic Domain Name. This service is free and can be obtained from a variety of companies (I use DynDNS.com). These free domain names however have suffixes that might not be so desirable for your website's image. In this case, you can just buy your domain name. This price depends on what hostname you are buying because some hostnames are more desirable than others, but the average price is 9 dollars. If you obtain free hosting, your domain name will be usually provided for you and will resemble the nature of the free Dynamic Domain Name (suffixed). Last but not least, if you buy your hosting, the registration for your domain name will usually come included in the price.|`|OZ1Lko1waa	Hello, <br>  <br>    Although you may not want to pay for hosting, it is important to look at the total package that comes with paying a host. Really a webhost is only as good as the customer service it offers. A great host should have 99% Network uptime, fast and reliable hardware, and 24X7 customer service availability. You should be able to call the Host 24 hours a day and speak to someone that can help. No matter who you are, you will want great customer service. I would look into HostMySite.com.

TRLsiqZOaa	There are a few different things that can cause this to happen. <br>  <br>  The most obvious is that you are engaging in file sharing of some sort. When a file sharing program runs, it usually performs two functions: "seeding" (uploading) and "leeching" (downloading). A peer-to-peer program, such as the popular LimeWire, or perhaps a program utilizing bit torrents, will upload a large amount of data.<br>  <br>  If you are not using a file sharing program, and not uploading any content to the internet that you are aware of, you may be the victim of a malicious software attack. <br>  <br>  Perpetrators of internet crimes will frequently secretly install remote control (rootkit) software on target machines and utilize them, unbeknownst to the users, to send out mass amounts of spam, or less frequently, for DDOS attacks (Distributed Denial Of Service)<br>  <br>  It's a good idea to have up to date legitimate anti-virus software. In your case, I believe a robust firewall will stop this action, or at least help you identify the problem. <br>  <br>  I have a list of recommended software here:<br>  <a href="http://www.anthonyscardina.com/tech/recommended.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anthonyscardina.com/tech/reco...</a>

kssArYTVaa	You probably have spyware on your computer. To remove it, you should re-run a full scan on AVG (since it also scans for spyware). When it finds something, you should remove it all right away. It could also be your registry; you could download CCleaner from File Hippo (filehippo.com) and it cleans out unneccesary files off your hard drive. You can run the cleaner then scan for errors in your registry. I'd be willing to bet that you have at least one error in your registry. Sometimes these errors can cause your computer to run slow. After every scan is done, you should restart your computer.<br>  <br>  Another reason why your computer could be running slow is because you may have a bunch of programs installed. Uninstall all the programs you don't need or use anymore and whichever ones you don't really need running, exit them through your system tray. When you have multiple programs running at once, it will lag a lot.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6y7IAMfHaa	Ya I Got This Dumb Problem Too. <br>  <br>  I Hate Stupid Nerds Who Made This Crap.

That's why it plays on your computer but not your DVD player.  Most DVD players do support the AVI CODEC but it looks like yours does not.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  You'll probably have to recode your Vids in a format that your DVD player understands.  Try MPG.  By the way, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+R DL etc...  are media, not formats.<br>  <br>  It's also possible that the software you're using doesn't have the right CODECs to burn the DVDs.<br>  <br>  It does seem that DvD Flick supports AVIs but, DvDrip-axxo, beware of torrents.

In many cases, you can type a feature you want to use or action you wish to take and it will display a step by step tutorial along with picture.  In some cases, MS has even implemented online help in which you can access a website from the help display and watch the video on the related issue. <br>  <br>  General acquaintance books will be filled with opinion and a lot of extra junky information.

Your symptom could indicate that your screen is bad, but the laptop is otherwise fine.  To test this, hook up your laptop to an external monitor using the SVGA (blue) port or DVI (white) port on your laptop.  Once the laptop and external monitor are connected, turn your laptop on.  You may have to press Fn + F5 to get the video mode to change onto the external monitor.  If the laptop shows normally on the external monitor, then you know the laptop is working fine.  <br>  <br>  There is one last thing you can test. Check if the screen connections got unplugged or loosened somehow.  Take a look at this laptop screen removal tutorial.

SNFuMM3daa	Hey there, Don't worry! When I first faced to a torrent file, I got confused so much! Because the size of the file (It was a movie) was too small (about 10KB). I searched over the Internet and I found out these about a Torrent file:<br>  A Torrent file is a file that links you to other computers. Let me explain what will happen if you are trying to download a file (for example a music). Well you are entered to a Torrent search engine website like <a href="http://www.thepiratebay.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepiratebay.org</a> you will search your favorite file at this website. OOOOOOOOPS! You will face a lot of names as same as you entered or with a little change or a big change and a lot of numbers in front of them. If you don't know what are these numbers, don't worry, I'll explain.<br>  Someone uploads a file into the network. Someone else downloads it and he/she uploads the whole or a part of the file-The upload operation is automatic. Well, this function continios and the amount of the Seeders increase. Thats the meaning of the number which refers to Seeds. If the number gets bigger, the speed and the quality of the download increases. The number which refers to Peers is showing how much computers are accessible.<br>  So I think it is enough to know a bit about a Torrent file. But in brief:<br>  A Torrent file contains some links to some computers which uploaded the file on the server. If you want to download a file from the Torrent network, you must have a P2P (Peer To Peer) program. Such as uTorrent. you can get it here: <a href="http://www.utorrent.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.utorrent.com</a><br>  When you are downloading a file, you are uploading it at the same time!! But you can control it's speed.<br>  HOW TO DOWNLOAD A FILE FROM THE TORRENT NETWORK?<br>  1. Download the Torrent file which you like from one of those Torrent search engines websites. (I prefer thepiratebay.org)<br>  2.Open the file with your P2P program. (I prefer uTorrent)<br>  3.Start your download.<br>  4.EnJoY!<br>  **Sorry for my long explanation and a very bad English**|`|VQfW1KWcaa	A "torrent" or a "bit torrent" is a type of meta-data that facilitates peer-to-peer filesharing. Torrents have garnered much media attention lately because of their relatively unregulated use and the tendency of torrent users to trade illicit data. However, not all torrents are illegal.<br>  <br>  In other terms torrent is a protocol which enables fast downloading of internet files which uses minimum bandwidth.<br>  <br>  other definitions :<br>  A .torrent file is a file that contains the basic information about a file or set of files. This includes the file names, sizes, the date created and some other information. The torrent file also contains an info hash - which is basically just a unique code for that torrent. No other set of file(s) will have the same info hash as this one. The final thing contained inside the torrent is a list of trackers. If you have some torrent files, you can't open them in a text editor because they are encoded. You will need to open them in torrent client software (like Bitcomet which you can install on your computer.|`|TZNuem4naa	Torrent is the little tiny file that enables you download the file itself.  You'll need a client like "uTorrent" to download.  It's pretty simple to load and use.<br>  <br>  Torrents are a file sharing method where a number of pc's are making the file available, this can improve download times considerably instead of going to 1 single download source like most conventional downloads are done today.
T5Qyylobaa	Depends. If you want to go for system programming go for C++ , plus it provides you with raw native code power, so it can be tricky. C# is more coder friendly, Visual Programming Language, is managed and much easily readable syntax than C++.<br>  <br>  Both have their perks, depends what you want to do. Both are equally powerful and useful .=_=|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	C++ has a far wider scope. It's been around for decades, while Microsoft is still trying to shove C# down everyone's throats.<br>  <br>  If you want to develop for nearly any platform, stick with C++.<br>  <br>  There is a C# implementation for Linux (part of Mono), but there's been a lot of resistance to it in the community. C and C++ are still the kings there.

LrUj6rs0aa	Erica,<br>  <br>    Believe it or not, there are probably hundreds of thousands of professional sites out there built by folks with little to no web design experience.  There is no reason you shouldn't be able to build this whole site yourself.  You'll want to check out the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) simple web design programs.  One of the most popular and well-reviewed among these programs is Sandvox for Mac OS X from Karelia Software (<a href="http://www.sandvox.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.sandvox.com).</a>  Sandvox features over 50 design templates, with more coming from third-party sources nearly every day (<a href="http://www.sandvoxdesigns.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.sandvoxdesigns.com).</a><br>  <br>  See some examples of professional websites you can create with Sandvox at <a href="http://www.sandvoxed.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.sandvoxed.com.</a>  Check out their tutorial screencast at <a href="http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/screencast.html?autoplay=YES" rel="nofollow">http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/screencas...</a> and download a free demo if you like what you see.

If you really want to just kind of learn how to design a website, I suggest you look online for tutorials: there are hundreds of them. If you don't like the idea of going tut-hunting, then maybe you can ask a friend who has some experience on web design: they will probably be more inclined to offer this kind of help for free. By the way, if you need to make your website "look good", you should try a template: there are lots of them for free and they are not that hard to edit.

And they do not share binary compatibility (in other words, if you have a installer for a Windows program, you can't use that to install the program in Mac OS X, and vice versa).<br>  <br>  But, yes, basically, you click the icon and start the program, and you use a keyboard and mouse, and you can run multiple programs at once. You have a file browser. You start. You shut down. All that.<br>  <br>  And, no, Windows no longer runs on DOS. Windows runs on an NT kernel (the DOS command prompt is a separate process you can start up within Windows, but it was ditched after Windows 98 and ME). Mac runs on the BSD kernel and has a very Unix-like filesystem architecture.|`|RyvKws7Laa	A Mac is a PC.  PC means personal computer.

And it works differently than Windows or Linux.  But that's kind of to be expected, all operating systems are different.  Some of the mentalities of how you "use the computer" are different, but not in huge ways.  On the Mac most of it is just drag and drop frankly, so its not a hard stretch to have to learn it.  Sure it takes some getting used to, but its not that big a deal.<br>  <br>  Otherwise its just a computer.  It runs computer programs.

3d6bn4Qzaa	Well, unless you are an engineer with an engineering degree from an accredited 4-year university, then no, you cannot say that you are an engineer.  That is not just another term to sound smart, a lot will be expected of you.  <br>  <br>  A network engineer designs, plans, builds, test, and integrates systems.  A high level of understanding and responsibility will be expected.  <br>  <br>  IT support would be the next level down, responsible for being able to configure all of the equipment that the network support staff have built.  IT support is called upon to fix virtually any computer or network problem that arises within an office environment.  This can be anything from replacing a broken mouse to figuring out what setting some idiot broke on his laptop and "can't remember what he did."  IT support may also be required to reconfigure routers and access points at a moment's notice when a customer arrives and needs access to the company network.  <br>  <br>  Network support covers wiring up cabling and power cords, hooking up networking equipment ( switches, routers, etc. ), debugging outages, and sometimes basic configuration of routers and wireless access points.<br>  <br>  Help Desk support is the bottom of the barrel, ranging anywhere from lower IT support to reciting line-by-line how-to help documents from Microsoft's website to people who cannot figure out the difference between a capslock key and a shift key.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't shoot too high, be reasonable.  Nothing angers busy engineers and managers quite like a computer problem that they know how to solve ( and simply do not have the time to ), but then they have an IT guy who is little more than a Help Desk worker claiming to be of IT proficiency who cannot have the problem fixed by the time the meeting starts.  At the same time, if you find that you can genuinely answer most questions that people ask you about computers, now might be the time to go for a few certifications ( A+, Network+, CompTIA, etc. ) and move up the chain.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck!
f0fAx8vgaa	i use "rane seratto"  for dj-ing.it ids a really good program and the hardware is bombproof,you can either use it with a dual cd player or on your laptop and the program uses I-Tunes for the library so you dont need to set up a new library and it is easier to load music.|`|kssArYTVaa	I think rodeo DJs just use dual tape decks. They play one and when it's appropriate to play another type of music, they hit play and pause the previous tape so it's seamless and you don't have to wait for the hard drive to load up the song of your choice (with iTunes).

That is one area where you should not take the cheap way out. More than likely, it is the Power Supply.<br>  <br>  You should use Coolmax, PC Power & Cooling or Antec. And, it's not necessarily the Watts rated but how long(85-90%) the power supply can deliver its maximum wattage and still stay cool & quiet. I suggest you get one that is rated @ 550-600.
1XArHka0aa	If you are particular about using NUMBER, there are display formatting ways to avoid the disappearing 0.  However, I recommend you stick to either DATE or TIMESTAMP, in order to take advantage of the numerous built-in functions provided by Oracle.  This way, you don't have to write fancy logic in your code to handle common concert situations where a concert starts at say 10 pm and goes past midnight.  Oracle will do the heavy lifting here.  And of course, you could choose to only display the time, even though you store the date and time in these datatypes.<br>  <br>  By the way, you may even be able to use the INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND datatype, in conjunction with just a start time stored in another column.<br>  <br>  For all the details on these data types, refer to the link below.|`|KLoI7bdXaa	wut

2SSA9e9Naa	Andrew has some good advice for you. The only thing I can add is that a return can be useful to know if something passed by reference is changed.<br>  <br>  For example you have a function that will get data from a user and append it to a string or array. How do you signal to the caller that nothing was added?<br>  <br>  They could keep track of the length before and compare after the call. Or, your function could return a false indication.<br>  <br>  So, the answer to your question, like so many programming questions is, it depends.|`|838TBllwaa	Not necessarily, but sometimes it helps. For instance, if you are overloading the >> or << operators, even though you will call the istream or ostream objects by reference, you will still want to return the stream. <br>  <br>  In many cases, it isn't necessary if you can store the information you need while the function runs, because then there is no need for a return value, but this won't always be the case. Especially because you aren't always going to be returning a value of the same type that you passed in as a parameter. You may very well pass in an object or who knows what, but may return a bool or integer, or maybe even an object of a completely different class.|`|Bj7IULS4aa	Passing arguments by reference can be used as an alternative to returning a value, but functions don't need a return statement if they have a void return type.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://xoax.net/comp/cpp/reference/functions.php" rel="nofollow">http://xoax.net/comp/cpp/reference/funct...</a>

The time it would take to do so varies on your hardware components, but expect a turnaround of 1 to 1 1/2 hour to install and an additional 1 hour to tweak and install your OS to your heart content. By doing a reformat, you are ensuring a 100% chance of all viruses/malwares being wiped from your computer.

Ql6qFk85aa	That's really weird.  I assume your system meets the minimum requirements, considering you're running Vista.  Did you uninstall the old version first?  That might be a good idea.  I did a search on microsoft.com for the download.  Here are the results: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/results.aspx?freetext=windows+live&displaylang=en&stype=s_basic" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/re...</a><br>  You'll notice that there's a download for Windows Live Messenger (Version 2008) released in late 2007.  That's probably the one you had before you installed the new one (it's what's on my Vista machine).  But then if you scroll further, you'll see Windows Live Messenger, no version ID, but a 2009 release date.  It may be that they changed the program so much that you can't just upgrade.  Or it could have just been something weird with the download.  Try downloading it from here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=c4adc3ab-ce3a-4d50-9412-9b99c75d7993" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.

Also I can't find in the description who the manufacturer of the board is. Other than that, your components will all work together. <br>  <br>  You have only one hard drive, videocard and one DVD drive so a 600 watt the power supply should be fine, but if you are thinking of running 2 video cards in SLI at some point or adding more drives, I would get a larger power supply.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/specpage.html?CSR-650TX" rel="nofollow">http://www.novatech.co.uk/novatech/specp...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you are going to be running Windows XP or Vista, 4 gig will be fine.

They are small and will need to run at higher RPM to cool the case as well as a case that uses 120mm. I would look for a case that utilizes 120mm if you want a quieter running system.

Depending on what software you are using for your scanning it might not show up. A trojan is not really considered spyware. My recommendation is to download two new programs that will replace what you may already have. One Ad-Aware Free Edition and Avast Anti-Virus. Both of these programs are completely free and work very well. Depending on the size of your harddrive Ad-aware should take 10-20 min to scan. You will want to chose the delete option after it competes for anything it fines. Avast will actually replace your existing anti-virus so you will have to uninstall the one you are using first. One you install it open its control panel and it has an option for a boot-time scan.

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people suggest that you either install or "get" something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would<br>  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without <br>  having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send<br>  send me a note, ideally with your YouTube or regular email <br>  address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache" <br>  (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

You have multiple devices that you want to connect. Most cable modems that I have seen only have one RJ-45 port.

The 4 ports that each have will allow you to connect the 3 devices you indicate directly. Setup is very straightforward as all can use DHCP . You should be able to plug in and have almost everything just work. The costs are about $50 to $70 but don't require anything other than cables. <br>  <br>  You plug the cable modem into the cable line from the outlet. You plug the router into the modem.

Although it won't be removed from your registry, it will be out of your sight and not taking up space on your machine.

Go to a reputable, small to medium sized computer store (NOT the big box stores) and have them do a security sweep.<br>  <br>  After that's done, go and change all your passwords to something cryptic. An example...take the two or three initials of two people you know that are NOT too important to you, but that you will remember them.  Then look on a phone (any but BlackBerry) and find the number equivalents...ex: d=3, t=8.  Now capitalize some of the letters and do the same to the numbers (a capital 8 is *).  This will create a password from 8-12 characters long that will be fairly easy for you to remember but VERY difficult to crack....ex Stephen Harper and Barack Obama...shbo...their number equivs...7426...so just there is shbo7426.  Now do ShoB&42^, where the first and last letter and the first and last number have had the "shift" key used beforehand.  The key to this is that the people are NOT very important to you, just names of people you can remember.  Changing the order of the "capitalization" will allow you to modify the password without having to remember a whole string of new characters.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Fac|`|Sl0UPcheaa	File a police report.

t5sYXwSqaa	Many viruses hide in folder, programs and files that are been used by the computer so Anti virus programs either cannot detect then or if they do they cannot delete them. Sounds like you have a mixture of a virus and malware. Firstly you need to download Malwarebytes antimalware and TR (Trojan Remover). Run both these in normal mode and delete anything found. Then restart the computer in safe mode (as the computer is starting keep tapping the F8 key) select start in safe mode and wait till it loads. Now run each of the programs in this order (NOT TOGETHER) TR and delete anything it finds, Malwarebytes and again delete what it finds, the run your Anti virus (NOrton 360) and again delete what it finds. This should now leave you with a clean computer. By the way all the programs above are free, just google them. Hope this helps. Good luck.

fmaYcsrzaa	How-to refill your ink cartridge<br>  <br>  The following is included in a typical Printer Cartridge Refill Kit : ink bottles, syringes and detailed instructions. Some kits include an air balance clip for balancing the air inside the cartridge to ensure proper ink flow. Some kits also include hand-drill tool to make a hole in the top of your empty cartridge.<br>  Refilling Process<br>  <br>  1. To start the refilling process, fill the syringe with one of the ink colors over the sink or several sheets of scrap paper to prevent any mess. Different printers hold different amounts of ink. In most Epson printers, the black cartridge holds approximately 17 ml and the color cartridges hold approximately 8 ml. See the instructions with your refill kit to see how much ink your cartridges can hold.<br>  <br>  2. Before inserting the needle, make a small hole in the top of the cartridge (one for each color chamber). The hole is at the top of the cartridge near the label. Simply push the needle through the hole and press to the bottom of the cartridge towards the outlet hole. It's important to fill the cartridge slowly so as to avoid the ink from foaming and introducing air in the chamber.<br>  <br>  3. You do not need to seal the refill holes since there are already breather holes on the top of the <b> Printer Cartridge </b>.<br>  <br>  4. Any unused ink can be put back in the bottle. You should clean the syringe with water and dry it properly to do the same process for the other cartridges or for future use. You can also label each syringe for the different colors so that each syringe is only used with one color. Even you can Buy Printer Cartridges at discount anywhere in united states<br>  <br>  5. Once you place the cartridge back in the printer, run the cleaning cycle 1 to 3 times. If there are any gaps in the printing, run the cleaning cycle again.<br>  <br>  Don't Forget<br>  <br>  There are a few things to remember when refilling your cartridge. It should be refilled before the cartridge is completely empty to avoid the chamber from drying out and clogging. Also, it is a good idea to let the printer cartridge sit for a few hours (or overnight) so that the pressure in the cartridge will stabilize.<br>  <br>  Some printers, like newer Epson models, have a green chip on their ink cartridges which is visible by looking at your cartridge. They are often referred to as "Intellidge" cartridges. The chip keeps track of how often the cartridge is used and lets the computer know when the cartridge may be low or empty. As long as you reset the chip, refilling the cartridge with ink from a refill kit will not be a problem. A resetting tool can be used to reset the memory on the chip. This allows the printer to recognize the cartridge as being full which makes printing with a refilled cartridge possible.|`|AA11434633	The first two links below offer videos showing you how to refill your ink cartridge.  The third link is of a company that sells ink refill kits.  They offer information on how to refill ink cartridges.

vK53Hh8naa	2D graphic designers for a gaming company will ususally create pre-production renderings of the desired results including characters, environment and fonts; game textures like the sky, floor, clothes, blood, etc. 3D graphic designers create characters, environments, and apply textures and graphics created by the 2D graphic designers. The 3D part will require some programming but it will be usually limited to kinetics, external program handles, etc. The real programming will be done by software engineers. So, if you were a graphic designer for a gaming company, and you have experience with 3D software like Blender or Maya, then you probably are well versed in a programming language like Python or MEL.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	That depends exactly what kind of graphics you're doing. Creating 2D bitmap graphics requires essentially no programming knowledge and you can get by on knowing how to use a decent image editing program like Photoshop, Corel Photopaint, GIMP, etc, although knowing how to create 3D graphics and convert the renders to bitmaps is also highly useful. Creating vector graphics (either 2D or 3D) might require some understanding of the concepts of programming in order to be able to produce scripted animations, but it shouldn't require an advanced knowledge of programming since all you're doing is just setting up animation sequences, you wouldn't need to deal with all the heavy lifting on the programming side. Furthermore, many large game companies would probably have a variety of artists skilled in different areas, so if you're no good at bitmap graphics you could get into 3D graphics, or vice versa. Some of them may even have positions for concept artists alone, although in that case you would still want knowledge of how to use image editing programs, as well as a lot of artistic skill.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  On a side note, this is my 10000th answer on Yahoo Answers! 8D|`|ALFMVEPKaa	yea , i think , but they may use their own softwares.|`|xfRUdiMSaa	There are no programming requisite for artists (2D/3D) in game companies.<br>  You'll have to learn technical constraints though, such as texture resolution, polygon limit per character, and so on depending on the hardware on which the game will be released for example.

Double-click on that and you'll see two choices:<br>  <br>  2.4 GHz wireless LAN<br>  5 GHz wireless LAN<br>  <br>  one of these will be ticked, and my guess is that the 5 one is. The two wireless frequencies are not compatible and most "household" frequencies are 2.4. So, you'll need to change - which is very simple.<br>  <br>  1. click the 2.4 one (or the other if 2.4 is checked)<br>  2. click OK<br>  3. you're done!<br>  <br>  No harm in trying.<br>  <br>  I had same prob as you and got same error messages, drove me mad!

Can you upload a screenshot - it might help to figure this out.<br>  <br>  It really shouldn't visibly lose quality. <br>  <br>  Here's a kind of too obvious question - are you actually applying the transformation? Because the preview when you rotate something does look like crap, but it cleans up when you hit okay and it renders.|`|nfxPpXDtaa	Hm. You shouldnt lose quality?

Install this software on your server PC(your home computer). No port forward needed, a repeater is used by the LogmeIn servers to exchange the data.<br>  <br>  You can then "log in" to your home PC and remotely connect it. You connect to it from a webbrowser and view your Desktop from a webbrowser. Eg: firefox, internet explorer. From your desktop, just open up your internet explorer or FF and start surfing whatever you want as if you were home.|`|piYK8wl1aa	We've used so many proxy websites that most of them are blocked, we've tried nearly all of them, and the LogMeIn probably won't work, c2k is pretty strict, and controlled in a massive datacenter so we can't really do much without it being blocked within the next week.<br>  <br>  I was thinking of Cain&Abel, but that'd probably get me expelled.|`|ZYupITjtaa	<a href="http://proxy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://proxy.org/</a>          <br>  <br>  Try it and enter the site you want to visit.

Unless the Compact Disc contains some sort of malware such as virus, no. <br>  <br>  The first thing that comes into my mind when the computer shuts down unexpectedly is overheating.<br>  <br>  When a hardware such as CPU overheats to a certain number, computer shuts down to minimize any more damages to the CPU.<br>  <br>  Is all the fans/heatsink(if any) in your computer functioning? If yes, then I suggest you to check out SpeedFan, which is a software that monitors your (mobo/cpu/hdd) temp, voltage, fan speed, etc.<br>  <br>  From there, you would know if overheating is the issue or not.|`|nwZanqwoaa	Unexpected shutdown is almost always an overheating problem, unless it is accompanied by a blue screen of death. Open your case and see if you can determine which fan is not spinning, or if too much dust has collected.|`|b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	First guess is always power supply. If you don't have a power supply tester, I highly recommend it. They are a lot cheaper than a $125 an hour tech. If your power supply tests ok, check the CPU and case fans, if they aren't running, or are clogged, you'll over heat. Clean the dust and dirt buildup inside the case, that can also contribute to over heating. Lastly, visually examine the mother board for bulging capacitors. They look like this photo <a href="http://www.fotosearch.com/GLW137/gwc118050/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fotosearch.com/GLW137/gwc1180...</a><br>  <br>  If the tops are bulging at all, on any of them. you probably have a motherboard issue.

DjGEJfaPaa	If you reformat everything will be "gone" and like new, but data can still be recovered. If you are selling your computer it would be wise to wipe the information permanently.<br>  <br>  I recommend DBAN. Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot disk that securely wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.<br>  <br>  Please note: It is possible (though extremely unlikely) to recover data even if it has been erased and written over many times. The only true way to ensure data is never recovered is to physically destroy the drive.|`|lZ8VBYlgaa	Yes if you wipe the drive clean it will take everything off of it and it won't be bootable.  Don't just format it as there are ways to get to that data if someone really wanted to.

Run file shredder and, shred free space.  The file shredder writes an algorithm over the free space.  The DoD method is the one used by homeland security and, the Guttman method is used by many governments to insure that no data is recoverable.  If you run the DoD shredder then run the Guttman method absolutely no data will be recoverable.|`|cNZbaEDEaa	You can format your hard drive that will wipe windows off.<br>  <br>  But to really clean your hard drive you need to erase the data about 7 times.

You do not say if this temp is at idle or under load so there can be issues. <br>  <br>  You might want to check the bios settings. There might be a control panel in the bios that will warn you or shut down at a certain temp. Most of these type of controls are set at 75c so that gives you an idea where your cpu is at. <br>  <br>  45c in the case is also high. You might want to check your fans and air flow.

Cleaning the computer now requires you to follow these steps, because modern viruses and spyware entrench themselves in files that your computer needs in order to run:<br>  <br>  1. Virus-check your data files (not application files-- you have installer CDs for those).<br>  2. Back up the data files, getting them off your hard drive.<br>  3. Get your original operating system CDs that came with your computer.<br>  4. Boot your computer from the operating system CD.<br>  5. Select the option that erases your hard drive and then reinstall your system software.<br>  6. Turn on your software firewall that came with your operating system.<br>  7. Reconnect to the internet, and download *all* Windows updates, no matter how long it takes.<br>  8. Reinstall your application software, and update the applications as much as you can.<br>  9. Reinstall your data files.<br>  10. Create a limited user account on your system that does *not* have administrator access, and web surf only from this account.<br>  <br>  Yes, this is a pain in the butt. No, there is no other way. No, antivirus and antispyware programs cannot fix this problem on its own.<br>  <br>  So, what do you do in the future?<br>  <br>  1. Never click on links you find in an e-mail.<br>  2. Never open an e-mail attachment, ever.<br>  3. Only download files from a reputable website that you know is on the up-and-up.<br>  4. Never use bit-torrent and other file-sharing programs.<br>  5. Never use an unsolicited drive-checking site.<br>  6. Turn off all java and java scripting by default, and only enable java and java scripting for sites that you know you can trust.<br>  7. Never read an unsolicited e-mail, and delete spam immediately. It is possible to be hacked by reading an e-mail alone.<br>  <br>  Please adhere to the 'dont's' I provided above, because you will have to repeat the cleaning steps that I listed first *every time you get infected.* Anti-spyware and anti-virus programs are good to have, but they are a second line of defense.

nwZanqwoaa	you will have to open your laptop up and remove the cmos battery. It is a nickel size watch battery located somewhere on the motherboard. There may also be jumpers for this, but in most cases removing the battery for a few minutes alone is enough to clear all cmos ram and allowing you to access your bios.<br>  <br>  This works, because to store that password in cmos memory which stays saved even when the laptop is not powered it requires a small amount of power supplied by that battery. Remove that battery and replace it and you should be good to go.|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	First see if it may be a default password.

You need to unplug it. Take the battery out. Under one of the removable panels on the bottom you will see the cmos battery. In laptops they are wired in with a plug on one end. It will be between the size of a nickle and a quarter with 2 or 3 wires around a 1/4 inch thick. Just unlug it, wait a few seconds and put it back in. Replace your battery and power supply.

Whenever I have problems like this, I usually leave and come back to it another day.<br>  <br>  Are you using a proxy server to access your account?  Sometimes, depending on the proxy settings, it won't let you do things like this (for example, the proxy I use whenever I'm at school blocks flash, and won't let me enter any captchas).<br>  <br>  Another thing I might do is check on Tom's MySpace page.

If it doesn't then you may have to go into the BIOS to enable the port.<br>  <br>  The only other suggestion is you may have to install drivers that came with the mouse.

Go to network setup wizard by clicking Start, and right click Network, and go to properties. This should open the Network and Sharing Center. Then go to Set up a connection or network. Follow the steps, choosing the options that best describe how you are set up, and when it asks if you want to create a set up disk for other computers that you're going to connect to the network, pull out your favorite flash drive and save it to there. Finish out the network wizard and plug the flash drive into your laptop. Run the file that you saved there, and finish out that wizard. Now go to Start > Control Panel > Printer > Add a printer.

AA11976863	I am definitely going to buy a Toyota for my next car. Then I will be perfectly safe. LOL<br>  <br>  My GF uses Windows almost exclusively, unaware of any viruses (viriii?). I installed and ran an anti-virus app on her computer. It found 182 invasions (mostly worms, Trojan horses, dialers). She was amazed.<br>  <br>  Some malware (virus, worm, whatever) will invade a Windows OS no matter what file system. This means you can definitely get some bad stuff on a VM box. Other malware needs to do something to the file system. You don't have a DOS based file system, no worries about those types of bad guys. Rarely we hear about malware that affects the BIOS. Mac has no BIOS, no worries.<br>  <br>  There are several reasons why Macs don't get viruses. It becomes a chicken-egg argument. In fact, latest market surveys show Mac OS at 9 percent, not 2 percent. Virus makers (mostly the same mentality that likes to scrape a key along a new car) want to cause headlines, so they concentrate on Windows. Even if Mac OS gains as much as 50 percent of the market, it will still be very difficult for those guys to make effective Mac viruses due to the security of the UNIX base in a Mac. System files cannot be changed without a password. A virus cannot even install itself on a Mac unless the user types in his password when the virus asks for it. You would have to be as dumb as a stump to do that. Windows security, as well all know, is a joke, thus the plague of viruses for it.|`|2vz59utAaa	No. The windows running on parallel is completely separate.

For 6 years and several PCs, I have never run a Anti Virus program, and have NEVER had a virus. Macs can get a virus, just as easy as a pc. The reason  Macs don't get them, is because 98% of computers are PCs. Think about it- If 98% of the cars in the world were Honda's, and 2% were Toyota's, how often do you think a Toyota would be involved in an accident? Almost never! And that's why Macs don't get viruses.

NpZukuuraa	Pc is not maintenance-free devices. It’s not as simple as just power them up and go. Every pc, over time, will require routine maintenance to optimize pc performance and to avoid registry processing errors.<br>  <br>  The registry is a directory of system settings and options. As modifications are made to the pc configuration in the framework of hardware and software additions or upgrades, the registry is altered. Sometimes these alterations may clash with the current system.<br>  <br>  As time goes by, registry changes accumulate. There is significant risk of incompatibilities between the file processing. These issues translate into performance drawback that typically explodes overtime. To avoid the damage, it is necessary to cleanup registry file.<br>  <br>  Manual repair and maintenance of the registry is an extremely complex task that only the most technically inclined should take on or you run the risk of losing critical data and personal information or even worse end up with a computer that doesn't work at all. With the proper software, however, registry repair becomes a relatively stress free task that will improve your PC's performance without going round the twist and losing one's mind.<br>  <br>  Symptoms a pc registry repair is needed<br>  <br>  Performance issues that indicate the need for pc registry repair typically worsen and become more frequent over time. Once a registry repair is applied, however, there is a noticeable improvement in performance.<br>  <br>  Common issues that indicate a need for windows registry repair include (but are not limited to):<br>  <br>  You are having slow computer problems.<br>  Windows setting change unexpectedly.<br>  Shut down is slow and usually with error message.<br>  Anti-virus and spyware software didn't repair the issues.<br>  There are crashes and continuous computer freezes.<br>  The computer starts slow.<br>  Rebooting the computer is becoming a consistent problem.<br>  Errors specifically pinpoint a problem.<br>  There is an inability to properly add and remove software on PC.<br>  There is the "Blue Screen of Death.".<br>  The computer is experiencing lengthened response times.<br>  Computer internet is slow.<br>  Program launches are delayed.<br>  <br>  If you are experiencing a good portion of the problems above, there is definitely the need for an XP registry repair.|`|p6xgtONXaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  What are the icons for exactly?<br>  <br>  If you know which programs you can delete those icons and replace them with the correct icons from the folder where the programs are installed.<br>  <br>  If they prove hard to delete, try in safe mode.<br>  <br>  Have you checked that you do not have a virus?<br>  <br>  Arnak

0qN4IStOaa	a system restore will not bring back files you deleted.  unless they are core windows system files.  you need a file recovery software program, and there are a lot out there, but good luck because if it is pictures, music, or video they normally cannot recover them all the way.<br>  <br>  File deletion and recovery is not based on the amount of time that has lapsed.  it is based on weather or not you have been reading/writing to the drive you had the info on, and i am assuming you have.  the way a computer works is that you do not "delete" a file, it is still on your hard drive, but you are just telling the computer if it needs more space then it can write over that file.  Trust me i have worked with file recovery a lot and it is not easy, it take a LONG time, and you are never 100% sure to get the files back at all.  with pictures you might be able to get the whole picture or just part of it and the rest will be greyed out.  do as i say and get a new hard drive first.  but if you deleted files they will NOT come back with a restore or recovery of windows.|`|zPCtQvonaa	Michael P, sure she/he can recover any deleted data, but it depends on how long was the data deleted. The longer, the slimmer the possibility gets.<br>  <br>  Disk sector (in the platter) is a unit of storage, which stores a fixed amount of data. Somewhere in the sector, there was the deleted data, until the owner actually deleted the data, which becomes unused space. Depending on how long the owner deleted the data, the unused space, where the deleted data used to be, would be filled by another data. If the unused space hasn't been occupied by another data, the owner could recover the file while it's in good condition.

I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage! <br>  Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...<br>  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!<br>  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.<br>  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!<br>  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.<br>  Recommend tool:  <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|RT8LZy7gaa	Go on the game's websites to see if there are video cards that absolutely won't work with their games.

You could try transplanting it from another unit, but it's risky. If you don't mind risking $55, go ahead and try it. <br>  <br>  They're usually complicated to open, dissasemble and transplant. And it could even use a different connector, like I've seen in different models of TomTom One.|`|AbRfd29Haa	The Best Buy guy is correct... charges for parts out-of-warrenty are usually pretty high, and of course, they're charging markup and labor. Chances are, he is "full of it" in the sense that, for $800, you could probably buy a much better laptop today.<br>  <br>  If your exact model is on eBay for $55, and it's sold as working, there's no particular reason you couldn't transfer the screen. But it's very delicate work.. laptops are really crazy inside, with tiny fragile connectors, etc. I work in electronics design, I don't think twice about opening up desktops or most other electronics, but laptops make me nervous. Just how difficult the surgery would be depends on on the model. Most modern laptops also put their Wi-Fi antenna(s) in the display, so you may have 1 to 3 radio cables to deal with, too. <br>  <br>  Another option... if it's the same laptop, and not being sold for parts but sold as working, you could much more easily move your hard disc drive to the eBay unit, and then you're back in business... it'll be your system up on the new laptop. This might be trouble if it's a substantially different model, but then again, that would be a problem anyway, since displays change all the time and you can't really be sure that somewhat-similar models have the same display, interface, etc.|`|XItuKiZSaa	it's easy to get cash for it
zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE.

hdTJ5Lpnaa	Avast 4.8<br>  <br>  comodo firewall pro<br>  malwarebytes anti-malware<br>  SUPERAntispyware<br>  ccleaner and mvregclean to clean your computer.<br>  m<br>  this is what you need|`|5Lt0tDboaa	You can use COMODO Firewall Pro because it is very good, and of course free. Avast doesn't have a firewall but it has a Network Shield that acts like a miniature firewall to block known intrusions and Malware URL when you serach the internet. If you want a paid firewall, the best would be Outpost Firewall Pro, they currently have a limited time offer of lifetime license, so you can't updates forever...I also heard good things about Online Armor Free and its paid version, though i haven't used it extensively because i don't like its interface.|`|aVTRfGtBaa	a great firewall that i use is the comodo firewall its free and keeps your computer protected|`|LsEcUoOqaa	Download ZoneAlarm Free Firewall.....It is the best firewall....|`|KmEkXaeIaa	zone alarm is the best one <br>  u can use zone alarm internet security the u do not need any anti-virus and e.t.c
tsN5KrH6aa	It is not due to your motherboard. Close all open applications and try again. Else your RAM needs to be checked.It is a common peoblem caused due to lack of memory.|`|lrhDybjBaa	it's not motherboard problem. first close all running programs then try to run office. if still the problem occurred then you need to increase/upgrade RAM
o7k6n0Smaa	well if u wanna play battlefield you might wanna get alittle higher end card. I find the nvidia geforce 9800gtx to be quite a amazing card for 150 bucks should run pretty much anygame you want. But on the other hand it also depends on the graphics chipset that is on your motherboard because if its outdated like a 560 your games will run like crap with pretty much any high end card|`|C8Djjxqkaa	It is a PCI express motherboard so most of the modern ones.|`|yMchHj9eaa	If you have a PCI Express X16, go for any PCI Express X16 2.0 card and you will be fine|`|13b723f270d65c013797b5d13e3884adaa	depending on the power supply, you can throw pretty much anything in there.  You might have to check some of the case specs since it is a mid-tower and the best video cards are huge.  Also, since that is a "business" spec board...I assume that the power supply is no more than 350w max...so that will limit you to a low-mid range single gpu card like the ati 4650.
3oKdpWBtaa	Sorry i have no idea, and i see no one else has answered either.<br>  <br>  I would suggest emailing microsoft for some advice on how to do this, alternatively you could try signing up to technology forums and asking your question there or extensively searching the internet for some answers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps..
ZIPd99xtaa	100% NO<br>  Copying digital media produces an exact copy of the original with nothing added or taken away.|`|bFi2UC07aa	this really depends on your USB type. such as if your USB device is USB 1 or USB 2. secondly what type of computer you have. lets say you have a good configuration computer than - no this will not impact your quality of music. based on the type of machine you have all that will impact is the speed at which the machine can read the file but quality will remain the same.|`|0b70eb52e1be7d3446efc4218274cf1daa	no, the files will be EXACTLY the same no matter how many times you copy them|`|NOCpBlHuaa	no|`|f4e14450d07448a4a048a7386ae80066aa	not at all

pUzJiMUcaa	If you know C#, you can make the transition rather painlessly. Java works very much the same way that .NET does, it just uses different keywords.<br>  <br>  If the employer is looking for a Java pro, it may not be right for you. But if they are looking for a junior dev, and you are strong with OOP, I'd go to the interview. If you aren't sure, interview anyway. So long as your resume doesn't straight up lie about your experience, you might get a chance to get familiar with another (arguably the most popular) language.<br>  <br>  I've found that most competent OOP programmers can go from Java to .NET is a pretty short amount of time, so long as the .NET programmers aren't exclusive to VB.NET. VB.NET won't help you any when it comes to the syntax of Java (or anything other than VB, for that matter).<br>  <br>  Just be up front. If you're not employed, it might be worth it. Some employers are willing to hire someone who is not experienced in order to save money.<br>  <br>  If you're still not sure, check out some Java source on the net, see what you can make of it. If it's completely foreign, you'd do well to stay away from a Java job.|`|3ekXcl69aa	Java has many similarities that .NET has. You should be fine. The language that Java uses is derived mostly from C and C++, which are both used in .NET depending on what you are doing. So go ahead. You should have been able to find a job as a .NET developer or something down that road. I'm guessing you do not have a college degree, but that is ok. Since you know ASP.NET, you should be able to pick up Java easily. All of these programming languages are built off one another in some way. Once you learn one, all the others will come easily.|`|C6lPTdNSaa	To be perfectly honest, this sounds like a career choice (..duh -.- )<br>  Career choices are one of the most important decisions in one's lifetime. erm,.. I'm ranting xD<br>  right, back to the point.<br>  Since you already have experience as a .Net-er, I would propose for you to wait for an opening in that line of work, rather than wasting the shear amount of time you dedicated yourself to learning .Net programming, by choosing go to with Java.<br>  Of course I've based this on the possibility that, by the time you're ready for Java, you might have found a job for .net-ting..<br>  At the end of the of day, it's your choice, the above is just an insight.<br>  Hope it answers more questions than it poses. :D|`|6XuZ7BOSaa	There are a number of ways of answering this question. As you may already be aware, the .NET framework is in constant evolution (ref: framework 3.5 Windows Communication Foundation, WorkFlow Foundation, SQL2008, VS2008, etc.). Given your past history, I would certainly recommend that you keep up with Microsoft as I believe you will have little time for anything else. I am sure that you will extremely marketable given that a number of businesses are porting over to 3.5 from 2.0. A whole world of packages and Classes are waiting for you. In addition, Microsoft is providing a number of resources for free to get you up to speed - quickly! update your CV with 3.5 components and I am sure you will land a job soon.<br>  <br>  I agree with the others that Java shoulddn't be much of a stretch for you given your certification. Yet the language is not really the problem. Its all those classes, development patterns, best practices which takes time to 'Digest'. This is equally true for .NET as it is for J2EE. <br>  <br>  Bye<br>  Jim (Jacques) Colmenero<br>  Enterprise Architect<br>  Architect/Developer
yMchHj9eaa	Set the harddrive up as a slave in a different PC, or you can buy an IDE/SATA to usb and turn it into a external harddrive.|`|vniiPLIFaa	I'm a little confused. You connected a hard drive to your computer via USB?<br>  <br>  Take the bad drive out of the computer and slave it inside yours. You should then be able to see whatever the corrupt drive will allow you to.
bFi2UC07aa	you should know that there are different media type such as CD-R CD-RW  CD+R and CD+RW. Not all players can read such type of media unless it specifically says CD-R or CD+R etc. check your manufactures specification and ensure that your Player can read these disks. The only reason you have this problem is because your player cannot read the media type.|`|DCXk0bVLaa	Does your player play "off the shelf" CDs?<br>  Does it still play CDs you burned before the Dell guy worked on the computer?<br>  If it doesn't the problem could be in the player.<br>  The solution could be in the purchase of a lens cleaning disk.<br>  <br>  If it does what app did you use to burn them?<br>  It appears it has developed a problem since installing Roxio.<br>  Burn errors can occur if the burn rate is too high.<br>  I burn at 24x for audio (music) files to keep any of these errors to a minimum and so far without a glitch. The extra time it takes to burn is minimal.<br>  Data files such as mp3's will generally tolerate a higher burn speed but 24x is insurance.<br>  I use an burning app called Deepburner Free burning at 24x.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deepburner.com/?r=download" rel="nofollow">http://www.deepburner.com/?r=download</a><br>  <br>  It's worth trying this to eliminate Roxio as the problem.<br>  If this doesn't fix it the burner could be the problem. In that case the Dell guy might have to be consulted. If it was working before he worked on the computer and not after the problem could be there.<br>  If the work was under warranty they'll want to know what you've done prior to further repair work. Warranties usually don't cover software problems.

Its one line but its very versatile. It will basically execute every batch in the folder. The folder can be passed as the first parameter. If no folder is passed, then it will use the folder where the batch is located. It will never execute itself (Nasty bug when I tested...but its fixed).<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  By the way I did some testing and I didn't like the way the batches just started popping up. Then I remembered you had a few hundred of them so I edited the code and added a /MIN in order to start the batches minimized. By the way, is there a reason why you have a hundred batches...seems like what you need is a better solution to whatever problem you are trying to solve with a hundred batches. I'll keep this question on my watchlist so if you decide to maybe reduce the size of those batches, just go ahead and post.<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  Very nice cyberdoc. Yes, it is definitely a simple solution. A for loop however, using your dir /b/s, would be a lot more streamlined and would skip the file creation.|`|C6lPTdNSaa	Unfortunately, I haven't yet come across anything as such, so sadly, no, there doesn't seem to be a solution to this problem.<br>  I hope you find what you're looking for, and if you don't, you could always invent it :D<br>  As all great problem solvers do, they invent, I lack the patience to invent anything so ...|`|lkB1Q5kmaa	Use another batch file that executes them all and just execute that one.

ae06239e62818780ae57b9ae07468d3caa	Those are just search sites that list torrents. All torrents work with utorrent. What matters is how many seeders there are - basically how many people are available to send the file to you.

It's the tracker, probably doesn't have any seeders even though the site says it does (They aren't live numbers, they update after a certain amount of time).<br>  <br>  All torrent sites are just sites that list trackers.

t5sYXwSqaa	When you say your laptop has become much slower, do you mean the laptop in general or the internet. If it is the laptop in general then it is not the router and could be numerous things. Try the following:<br>  <br>  There is no easy answer to this question as numerous things can make your computer slow. One program that you can try is Advanced Systemcare3 which is a free program that will do numerous things to your computer that a novice would find difficult to do. It will optimise your system, defrag if necessary, get rid of spyware, optimise RAM, clean registry, delete temp files etc. plus a lot more. If this does not work you may need to look further. Anti virus can make your computer run very slowly. Spyware is another culprit. You can run malwarebytes antimalware that is a good program for getting rid of adware/spyware. You can also run several registry cleaners like JV16 powertools, Glarysoft Reg Cleaner, CCleaner. It is also very useful to get rid of programs on the HD that you do not use and stop any programs that you do not need on the start up menu. Updating all your drivers can also speed up performance. Lastly and probably most importantly increasing the amount of RAM you have in the machine can significantly increase computer speed. Hope this helps. Good luck.

(to both).<br>  <br>  Think about it this way...<br>  <br>  You have two four passenger cars driving down the highway at 50kph each, side by side.<br>  A third four seater car comes along and passes the first two at 70kph.<br>  <br>  Are the first two four passenger cars faster than the third four seater because their combined speed is 100kph? No. They can simply carry twice as many passengers.<br>  <br>  The same is true with dual vs single cores...*technically* the duals can do twice the work as the single core...except they can't really.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	No, it does not mean you have 4.22 ghz.<br>  <br>  Some people will say that, but it is simply not the truth. A dual core CPU is simply capable of running two simultaneous threads at the same clock frequency. It will be faster when you are multitasking by basically having two CPU's to process the data, but it will not run any faster than 2.11ghz.<br>  <br>  2.11 is slower than 2.4 when you just take the clock speed into account.<br>  <br>  But certain CPU's are faster than others even at lower clock speeds. Things like Cache memory, instruction sets and architecture are all important in how efficient the CPU is at a certain clock frequency.|`|e8b38297d9e56a30610db6c938b6aa2faa	No, it means that you have two so-called cores, each running at 2.11 GHz (capital G because it's a prefix higher than kilo; and capital H because it's short for Hertz, a person's name...).<br>  <br>  Those numbers indicate the rhythm with which the processor executes instructions: the faster the rhythm, the faster the processor.

0abf52e9048e05a852e90e1316728b92aa	It's not really the printer that does the scaling, but the computer software.<br>  <br>  When you are printing stuff from the internet (web pages, email, etc.) the reason for the small print is that it is related to the size of the monitor and it's viewing setup (the higher the screen resolution, the smaller the print will be when printing it out even though it looks good on the monitor).<br>  <br>  One way you can make the print larger when printing internet stuff & emails is by changing the print view size on the screen to a larger size in your web browser (this is separate from your other setting you've already setup). Go to the menu bar at the top (i.e. Internet Explorer), click on "View," then "Text Size" then select a size like "Larger" or "Largest" (something higher than what you're currently set to.) <br>  <br>  The BEST method is to go to your menu bar at the top of your web browser, click on "File" then "Print Preview". At the top of the window there should be a small window with "Shrink To Fit" in it. Click the arrow for a drop down list and choose something probably above 90% or more (maybe 100 or 125%) and see how it changes the print size of what is to be printed out.<br>  <br>  The only other method is to copy & paste the text into a text editing software like Word and adjust the text size there. If you're using a text program, then you simply adjust the size of the text to a 12 or 14 point, or larger, font size (adjust depending on the font and size you need) and that should do the trick.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck.|`|jHuIwZl8aa	Go in the printer preferences and you will see their is a scaling bar set to 100%.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to print, go the the preferences and reset thje scaling back to 100%.

pUzJiMUcaa	SQL injection has nothing to do with crashing a database, per say.<br>  <br>  It is used to gain access and/or manipulate data. Why does it work?<br>  <br>  Well, it doesn't...all the time. When it does, it's because someone didn't sanitize their database inputs. The question is kinda like "Why does taking the bus work?"<br>  <br>  Like I said, sometimes it doesn't, it's dependent upon other people, and it only works for a specific set of problems. <br>  <br>  Say, you want to know the contents of a database that is accessed through a website. So, you find out what the platform is, and alter the parameters passed through the URL, or cookie, or whatever.<br>  <br>  Or, you want to delete some records. Throw input');DROP TABLE users;-- onto the end of something that is being used as an SQL parameter, and watch the magic.|`|KtQdOqHKaa	SQL injection is caused by not correctly verifying data and not escaping it properly for your database.<br>  <br>  An example would be a script that does something like: "select * from users where username='" + request['username'] + "' and password='" + request['password'] + "'"<br>  which can easily be exploited by going to the url http://server/script?username=admin'+--<br>  When the request string is passed to the database, the password part of the query has been commented out so only the only detail that the database queries is the username.<br>  <br>  Because of this, people can also run update and delete queries by using similar strategies.  It generally won't crash your database (unless there is a specific query that can crash the database and that is the one that runs).  Jumping to another return address is a "buffer overflow", a completely different type of exploit.|`|NtrANOHOaa	One way to prevent that is using the "sq" function. Sq makes single quotes into double. Here is an example from a classic ASP page: <br>  If Act = "add" Then<br>    sSQL = "lg_JewelryCategoriesAdd " <br>    Button = "Add"<br>  ElseIf Act = "update" Then<br>    sSQL = "lg_JewelryCategoriesUpdate " &_<br>    "@jewelercategoriesid=" & sq(ID) & ","<br>    Button = "Update"<br>  End If<br>  I always use this so if someone was trying to misuse the database and did a ;DELETE * FROM then that would be put into the database as a string and nothing would happen. Its better to use stored procedures than injection, plus it's quicker since the database already knows what to do with the data.
