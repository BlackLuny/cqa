J'ai l'impression que les jeunes francais de souche sont de plus en plus victime des racailles a l'ecole et que cela les pousse tres tot vers le racisme.   "De mon temps" (Annees 80-90), il y avait beaucoup de racailles allogenes au lycee, mais comme tout bon jeune ecervelle qui se respecte j'etais tres tolerant (lavage de cerveau) et je pratiquais la politique de l'excuse systematique envers les pauvres "djeunes defavorises de banlieue". Ma prise de conscience s'est faite bien plus tard, lorsque je me suis apercu du lavage de cerveau du politiquement correct.      Mon sentiment est que les jeunes francais de souche sont exposes de plus en plus tot aux violences des populations allogenes et que, manquant de ponderation, ils se tournent vers le racisme au lieu de reagir sainement en se retounant vers la droite nationale, le respect des valeurs et la preservation de notre culture.

20081007065147AAmkPKz	Politics & Government;Elections	Why Do Republicans Seem to Ignore the Economy and the War?	The truth is that, despite the Surge, there are bombings and deaths every day in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. Walling different factions off into neighborhood areas keeps violence down, but the animosities are still there and will always be there. We cannot solve the religious differences in Iraq and our presence may well add to the problems. Republicans ignore all of this and want to continue the war to some elusive Victory, which may be impossible to attain without the continual presence of troops.      The U.S. economy is at its lowest point since the Great Depression. We may even surpass the Great Depression in misery and loss. Yet Republicans shoulder no blame for it.  They ignore the stupendous National Debt, which is up into trillions and cannot be counted on the famed clock, because it has run out of digits to record the amount.       Our country has disintegrated into divided ideologies. Our government is over budget. They either print new money or borrow it from China. Our industrial base is gone. Our Dollar is at an all-time low. Unemployment is high and the homeless multiply.  Yet Republicans refuse to shoulder blame, back a Candidate who agreed with Bush most of the time, and act as though they have made no wrong choices.      Why?  
20081007120421AAcZjyz	Politics & Government;Politics	We must be the change we want to see.  Does Sarah's crowd show us the change she would bring to America?	The crowd, fueled by the free manner in which Palin unleashed her own attacks, felt free, then, to unleash a few attacks of their own, on the media.      In Clearwater, arriving reporters were greeted with shouts and taunts by the crowd of about 3,000. Palin then went on to blame Katie Couric’s questions for her “less-than-successful interview with kinda mainstream media.” At that, Palin supporters turned on reporters in the press area, waving thunder sticks and shouting abuse. Others hurled obscenities at a camera crew. One Palin supporter shouted a racial epithet at an African American sound man for a network and told him, “Sit down, boy.”      The highlight of the aggressiveness of this crowd?      The reception had been better in Clearwater, where Palin, speaking to a sea of “Palin Power” and “Sarahcuda” T-shirts, tried to link Obama to the 1960s Weather Underground. “One of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers,” she said. (”Boooo!” said the crowd.) “And, according to the New York Times, he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol,’ ” she continued. (”Boooo!” the crowd repeated.)      “Kill him!” proposed one man in the audience.      Palin did not speak to squelch the angry attitude of the crowd.      Mohandas Gandi once proposed that “we must be the change we wish to see in the world.” What is intrinsic to this statement is that all changes you make in yourself, towards any goal, will also become manifest in that quest for change.      I’m not precisely sure what the end goals of John McCain and Sarah Palin are, but if the change they wish to see is to make America more divided, to allow tolerance for the lowest common denominator and insert emotional irrationality even deeper into the heart of our political machine, they are fast on their way to that goal.       http://outtheotherear.wordpress.com/2008...

I found Mccain very belitteling, a tactic I frown upon.       As for Biden/Palin they both did well - I have heard Palin has not had answers at cruicial times and has had Mcain step in.      The question here is not who you would vote for, but merely who do you think are the better two people to guide America into a better future .

Every die-hard fan of either candidate, put your cool-aid down, and give me a second of your time.      We all know that deep down, neither candidate is going to be a BAD president.    All rhetoric and political viewpoints aside, we know that both guys would do fine.      McCain ISN'T going to be another Bush term. He's not that stupid. I mean, who in their right mind is going to repeat any of that? He knows that the American people wouldn't accept him if he tried.      And for all you guys that slam Obama for being inexperienced, you know he's not going to be running the country by himself. Just like any other president, he will have scores of advisors to help him out.      So, I'm asking all you guys if even if YOUR candidate loses, who will put their hostility aside and support whoever wins?

20081031065454AAOXYwR	Politics & Government;Politics	If you consider yourself to be "Pro-Life", then how can you be against socialism?	Abortion is a very controversial subject, and I understand both views.  However, Roe VS Wade gave women the right to chose.  If somehow this supreme court decision is overturned, and women do not have the right to choose, anymore, doesn't this give the government "control" over a woman's body?      Another question....if this same decision is overturned, we will have (and it breaks my heart to say this) unwanted babies born into our country.  I'm sure most of these babies would be adopted.  However, aren't adoption agencies controlled in some way by the government?   Also, who is going to care for these unwanted babies?  Would it not be Social Services, foster care, etc...which receive funding from the government?      I've always understood that socialism means that the government pretty much controls everything.  We have freedoms in this country that other countries do not have and I am very grateful for that.  I do not believe our country will ever be a socialist state, but our government is for the people (or it is supposed to be) which means it helps people.      I am not trying to make this an argument about abortion rights.  I am trying to understand why people are so sure that Obama is a socialist and he will turn our country into a socialist state when we already have "social" agencies in our government that help people.      What do you think?

They even have said recently that he is a (gasp) communist!      If Obama is a socialist or a communist, then why would one of the most dominant capitalists of our time support him? Warren Buffett is no fool, he is the embodiment of capitalism and one of the smartest capitalists in the world and of all time. Why would he endorse Obama if Obama is a socialist?  Eric Schmidt is also a multi-billionaire capitalist, why would he endorse Obama if he were a communist?

20081025103909AAFAd0F	Politics & Government;Elections	Why would Joe the 'Planted' Plumber vote for McCain, if he is worried about paying higher taxes?	 http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/a...       From the article:   How, you ask, would each of candidates change Wurzelbacher's tax bill if elected president? According a recent study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Institute--which broke down Obama's and McCain's proposed tax plans by income bracket--Joe the Plumber (the guy making, say, $50,000 a year) would see his taxes slashed by $319 under McCain and $1,042 under Obama. That's a $723 difference. Meanwhile, Joe the Small-Business Owner (the guy making $100,000 a year) would pay $1,009 less under McCain and $1,290 less under Obama, for a difference of $181.       This presents us with an interesting--and illustrative--case study. Whether or not Wurzelbacher buys his business, he's guaranteeed to get a larger tax cut from Obama than McCain--and yet he still prefers McCain's plan to Obama's. Ultimately, then, we end up with two potential voting blocs. First there are the people who earn less than $250,000 and want the largest possible tax cut for themselves--a group that doesn't include Joe the Plumber OR Joe the Small-Business Owner. Then there are the people--like Joe--who earn less than $250,000 a year, but are willing to turn down the bigger tax cut for one of three reasons. Some are trickle-down/free-market adherents who believe that larger tax cuts for those richer than themselves will best serve the economy. Others simply don't trust Obama to keep his word. And then there are those who identify with the wealthy, believe they're bound strike it rich someday and don't want to pay higher taxes when they do.            Or is Joe the 'Planted' Plumber just another GOP drone whose brain is only there to keep his ears apart?

20081030192743AAoTk7p	Politics & Government;Elections	If teddy Roosevelt Were Alive Today Would He be A Democrat?	As president Teddy Roosevelt broke up the large monopolies and corporations of his day to protect small businesses, ensure fair trade practices and to fight against price fixing.  And he made the larger corporations pay their fair share of taxes because he was opposed to corporate socialism.      He believed in a form of capitalism where profit was fairly earned and not at the expense of the American people.      He was the first US president to favor Universal Health Care and wanted a National Health Insurance.      He broke up all the sweat shops and installed the first fair wages laws.      He implemented the first regulations that protected the American people from runaway greed.      He protected the environment from greedy exploiters.       So, my question is: if he were alive today and in politics would be a Republican as Republicans have become today or would he be more likely a Democrat?      Your thoughts?

Rather than nations wanting to take control of the world, why not take control of the masses, give them all jobs to produce some technological advancement and start turning this world into a non competitive world.

Ill be remembering William Wilberforce and his brave endeavours to rid the world of tyrannical slavery.  Ill be remembering Dr Martin Luther King and his valiantly unselfish attempts to secure Civil Rights for the downtrodden black people in the Southern States as recently as the 1960s. A man who gave his life for his ideals and who stood up to the White supremacist bullies  Ill be remembering Rosa Parks and the brave stand she took against James Blakes order to sit at the back of the bus in Montgomery Alabama.  Ill be remembering Fannie Lou Hamers plaintive cry that she was sick and tired of being sick and tired.  Ill be remembering the Million Man March in 1995 after which one and a half million black men registered to vote in the months following the March  Ill be remembering the poor and disenfranchised of America of whatever colour or creed who have not benefited from the past 8 years of George Bushs presidency which only advanced the interests of big corporations.  But most of all, Ill remember Dr King's I have a dream speech delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 when his words echoed in the ears of the people not just there on the day but also in the ears of future generations to come:    Let freedom ring. And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring - when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children - black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics - will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old ***** spiritual: "Free at last!

If the oath of office of the President/VP is to defend the Constitution, does one have to have to know it before running for office?   Even immigrants have to take a test about the US constitution before becoming US citizens. Why is Palin exempt?          Excat quote ""A vice president has a really great job because not only are they there to support the president's agenda, they're there like the team member, the teammate to the president," Palin continued. “But also, they're in charge of the United States Senate, so if they want to they can really get in there with the senators and make a lot of good policy changes that will make life better for Brandon and his family and his classroom.

20081031112306AAwMpij	Politics & Government;Politics	Which left? Which right?	May I ask why so few people seem to realize there are actually two left wings and two right wings as defined by the conventions of American political terminology?      In terms of how Americans define the political spectrum, there is a social left and an economic left, and a social right and an economic right.      When applying this to some historical systems, like fascism, you get two different answers to the right/left question depending on which aspect of the system you consider.      Fascism advocated, by the American convention of terms, a left-wing economic system, but also an extreme right-wing social agenda.      This seems to cause a lot of confusion with people arguing ad nauseam whether the fascists were right-wingers or left-wingers without ever detecting they’re speaking of two different things.      As this applies to American politics you have:      1) Libertarians – economically right, socially left    2) Conservative Democrats – economically left, socially right    3) Mainstream Republicans – socially and economically right    4) Mainstream Democrats – socially and economically left      Responses?

Isn't that like thinking a 50% discount on tires for customers at a certain store will somehow benefit people who don't even shop there? Do they even know what a tax break is? Why don't they understand that tax breaks benefit tax payers and not non-tax-payers?      Just for their information,   poeple who work and get a tax return got more tax money removed from their pay than they get back in a tax return. That means they are tax payers too. Is that hard to understand for Republicans?

If it was really used to add to the protein content of foods, why do they add the poison (and the extra expense) to fresh vegetables that aren't even expected to have much protein (and don't have an ingredient list anyway)?      We should be worrying about this because more food than ever is being imported from China (and they don't tell you this)!  Starbucks and Cadbury are just a couple of companies that use Chinese imports to make their products (and they are affected by this scandal as well, though they're not admitting that the US and other western countries are also affected, not just China).    http://www.unmadeinchina.org/contStd.asp...  http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/...  http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Produc...    "What is melamine generally used for?     Melamine is widely used in plastics, adhesives, countertops, dishware, whiteboards.    What are the health effects of melamine consumptions in humans?     While there are no direct human studies on the effect of melamine data from animal studies can be used to predict adverse health effects. Melamine alone causes bladder stones in animal tests. When combined with cyanuric acid, which may also be present in melamine powder, melamine can form crystals that can give rise to kidney stones.     These small crystals can also block the small tubes in the kidney potentially stopping the production of urine, causing kidney failure and, in some cases, death. Melamine has also been shown to have carcinogenic effects in animals in certain circumstances, but there is insufficient evidence to make a judgment on carcinogenic risk in humans."

The message, posted Monday on the password-protected al-Hesbah Web site, said if al-Qaida wants to exhaust the United States militarily and economically, "impetuous" Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain is the better choice because he is more likely to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.   -   "This requires presence of an impetuous American leader such as McCain, who pledged to continue the war till the last American soldier," the message said.

In the last few days, there have been many McCain supporters complaining that the “mainstream media” has been “unfair” in the coverage of this election and somehow slanted in Obama’s favor.      It seems to me, if John McCain were a viable candidate, Obama would have had a hard time convincing people to support him over McCain, but this is not the case.      If MOST people did not support “mainstream media”, they would not be the “mainstream media”.

He was abusive to myself and our son.  Since that time he has fathered another child and said child was taken out of his custody because of extreme abuse and horrible living conditions.  He has not seen our son for almost 2 years now and has only paid child support a handful of time since we split.  He is currently in prison for sexual misconduct with minor and is a registered sex offender now, is this enough justifiable reason to have his rights terminated?        P.S.      Please don't have my question deleted just because you don't agree with me.  I have every right to ask this and I am sorry if it angers anyone.  I have asked this question once before and it was deleted just because it offended someone.

20081112200331AArWt6n	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Are people ignorant when they say it's the lazy who want the wealth spread around.?	I posted a question about spreading the wealth around just a few weeks ago, where someone answered:   "If a man doesn't want to work then neither let him eat."  What kind of answer if that, for crying out loud. How is that supposed to be taken when people are losing their jobs every day.      Adults on welfare are often looked down on and considered lazy and taking advantage of the system. In comparison with those who hold jobs the percentage of those on state aid are still very low. Of those few, most have children who cannot be blamed for the situation they are in.  Neither can many of those parents who have applied for jobs but are turned down or there are none available.      Jobs created within the midterm  of the Bush administration were very low paying, many only part time with no medical benefits.  The last few years the unemployment rate has soared which means those who did hold a job may have exausted their unemployment compensation and have no choice but ask for government assistance to help their families.  A lot of those families have moved in with their parents because of the economy.  It's going to take more than just a few months to recreated jobs, so these families will have to either depend on the government or their families to help them out.         The link below goes back to 2004 with figures dating further back.        http://www.childrensdefense.org/site/Pag...       I have been one of the fortunate ones and hope I am never in that situation where I need "Free handouts" and want the wealth spread around because I'm lazy.  If I was in that situation, I would really resent someone saying that to me.   Sad that some people seem to think this is what spreading the wealth around  means.

Actually they are known to the true scholars of Islaam as Jihaadi and Khawariji. And the fundamentalist Muslims have been warning against them by name for many years. Salafees have been warning against bin Ladin since well before 9/11. Don't be followed by the ikhwanee Muslims who will warn against bin Ladin today to please the people. They are the same people who direct you to "scholars" (like Sayyid Qutb) who call to overthrowing rulers and bloodshed. Only the true scholars with a pure creed and methodology are outspoken in warning against the groups and parties from amongst the Muslims that seek to corrupt it whether those deviant groups are calling to Jihaad or other ideas which are contrary to Islaam. Don't be fooled by their beards or Islamic clothing, they are not "fundamentalist" Muslims, they are people of innovation (in religion) unless they follow the single pure and correct creed and ideology of Islaam.    It is the salafee Saudi scholars (who many accuse of extremism) who have been warning against corrupt idealogies (some of which lead to terrorism) for decades! And before them the true scholars have likewise been warning against innovations since the time of the Prophet! Unfortunately, today, the innovations are widespread amongst the Muslims and even though most Muslims do not support terrorism, they are still too ignorant to refute it and those that call to it.    Read what Shaykh Uthaymeen (one of the biggest authentic scholars of Islaam in 21st century) said about dealing with non-muslims in July 2000: http://spubs.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=LSC...    And know that it is authentically reported from the Prophet that he said : "Whoever kills one who is under an agreement of protection will not smell the fragrance of Paradise."  [Bukhari  3166]    It is not for the common folk to take verses and narrations out of context and use them as they see fit. Rather it is obligatory for them to the return to the understanding of the companions of the Prophet. And to return the scholars [those upon the correct creed] who have understanding of the religion its rulings and its requirements.    We were refuting bin Laden well before 9/11 and even before the CIA gave him a medal for his help against the Russians.    To learn about the true creed:  http://spubs.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=TAW...    What do you think?

Why is it that you are so in favour of a FREE MARKET capitalist system even though you would benefit a lot more from a mixed economy?    Under a system such as this you would get a fairer wage which would improve your standard of living, more would be invested in your country's infrastructure and spent on American people. Everyone would have easy access to healthcare and would not need to fork out at the time they need it.

South America are lucky having several nations with leaders who actually care about the people.

Well I know there is the one about him being a dictator :) but he's been democratically elected several times and the majority of Venezuelans and South Americans like, respect and admire him. So do I and I'm not ashamed to say it. He is one of the greatest leaders of the 21st century so far and if there were more like him the world would be a better place. 
20081114181806AAnS8Lj	Politics & Government;Politics	Torture, torture and more torture?	What is the point of torture in Guantanamo or any other secret prison all over the world? If they are in Guantanamo for terror related charges that means they must have concrete evidence to lock them up in the first place, so why torture them to get something out, if you know they are guilty? The torture is clearly a psychological element in trying to effect the state of mind of the victim of torture in trying to get false "evidence" out of them and looking at various torture methods used it seems to be used to kill them slowly on the inside, to break them down completely so they seem mental to everyone else. It seems this torture is part of the "war on terror" mentality.       Just to note I am not an expert on torture at all, I am still a teenager so I really can't be. However I do read books and have read a bit about torture and I think it's really horrid but it's an interesting element of this "war on terror".
20081114185807AArtiUx	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you think the mainstream media puts a lower value on civilians who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan?

I have an idea the leaders of the largest two (I say two because at the moment no one else has a chance which is a shame) have to compete with each other in mini activities. I think they should have an eating competition on who can eat the most burgers within 3 minutes. There should also have a wrestling match, refereed fairly of course and the best one is they should have a dance off. Wooh! Altogether an odd number of events so there is a clear winner and the winner gets extra "votes" rather than points depending on how many events they have won.

How come you still don't have some sort of universal health system as you like to call it but many other civilized nations do?   Do you think Guantanamo is hypocritical of the US, with the US claiming to be all about freedom and democracy?   Can you be a Christian and really support the Iraq war?

Just because our corrupt governments made outsourcing easy (yet the corporations still get all the tax payer benefits of corporations that stay in the US) and other countries treat their workers badly, does that mean we should follow and take the low road too?

20081219045434AAqJfsY	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Does censorship by prior restraint invalidate a claim to "freedom of the press"?	Can a legal structure that permits a government to _prevent_  publishing "banned" material really be said to allow freedom of the press?      The "prior restraint" clause in the U.S. constitution forbids this.  It's one thing if someone can be charged after-the-fact for publishing something, but even the mighty CIA has to suppress its former employees' books via commercial confidentiality-type lawsuits, before they ever get to utter the magic words "national security" to a judge.      Major differences in British-style and American-style capitalist democracy:      1. No prior restraint   2. Retention in U.S. of the old English common law right of armed self-defense (now forbidden where it was invented)   3. General presumption in law and custom in favor of personal rights over right of the state      Can you think of any other major differences?      Can such things as these be glossed-over as just administrative differences?  Dropping the "democracy" and "freedom" terminology so that no one gets defensive, can it really be said that these two systems are really the same?      Comments?  Arguments?

20081224154829AA4GDu7	Politics & Government;Politics	Julien Dray a déclaré : 'Rien ne peut m'arreter' ! Je pense que la police est d'un avis contraire!?	Lisez ceci vous allez bien rigoler :       Le Canard encha?né apporte lui aussi sa pierre à l'affaire Dray, cible d'une enquête préliminaire pour des détournements de fonds présumés. Si l'hebdomadaire donne sensiblement les mêmes chiffres que Le Parisien, il apporte des détails sur le train de vie du député PS.   "On connaissait sa passion irrépressible pour les montres de prix. Ses relevés bancaires prouvent que cela tourne à l'obsession et au délire. En trois ans, il a dépensé pour environ 200 000 euros dans des horlogeries, en France ou en Italie. "Je revends aussi", explique-t-il. "je suis un acheteur compulsif. Rien de peut m'arrêter. Les psychiatres disent que cela ne se soigne pas."   Et il n'y a pas que les montres. Julien Dray ne néglige ni les bijouteries comme Van Cleef, ni l'h?tellerie de luxe (...), ni le chausseur Berluti, qui lui a présenté, en juillet dernier, une facture de 1700 euros. (...) Le député socialiste fréquente les bonnes maisons, comme Hermès (note de 4100 euros), préfère les vêtements sur mesure et les stylos de qualité (3950 euros chez Point plume à Paris). Les enquêteurs ont ainsi dénombré 134 opérations de plus de 500 euros.    Quant au versement de sommes importantes sur le compte de Julien Dray (78 300 euros selon Le Canard) par de généreux donateurs "dont certains ont eu la chance d'obtenir des marchés publics". "? Rien à voir ? tranche Dray, qui accepte de répondre immédiatement sur ce point : ? Ce sont des amis. De vieux potes. Quand j'ai un passage difficile, c'est vrai, je les tape. Depuis des années.? Et est-ce qu'il rembourse ? ?Heu... Pas toujours ! ?"

20081006081803AAY4kxa	Politics & Government;Politics	Would a McCain administration be even more radical than Bush with the war-mongering?	Pat Buchanan has already written about McCain's top foreign policy advisor, a PNAC neocon who has been pocketing money from the president of Georgia, trying to get that country into NATO, and helping to provoke confrontation with Russia (if Georgia or the Ukrain join NATO, any conflict between Russian and those countries would necessitate NATO intervention - and the recent troubles in Ossetia were provoked by American-backed Georgian troops which attacked that region, and killed a lot of Russian nationals who live there...)   (I don't agree with Buchanan on everything but he sure knows his neocons, and if there is one force which has harmed America a lot in the last 8 years, it is the PNAC neocons, in my opinion, and I am not alone - problem is these guys do a lot of brainwashing in the big media, which they mostly control - PNAC founder William Kristol has a gig on Fox News every Sunday, and writes an op-ed piece in the New York Times, even).   "Who is Randy Scheunemann?" - by Patrick Buchanan    http://globalresearch.ca/index.php?conte...       Check this guy out, laying out the differences between either an Obama or McCain administration (he suggests that both will be forced to continue some version of the path that the Bush administration has set the country on, but that there will be key differences, depending who gets in).

20081120060150AAoJTu8	Politics & Government;Government	Is it time to dump democracy and return to an Empire?	Now let's be honest dear chaps; we have given you a chance to run things for a couple of centuries now and it's just not working.   The economy is a mess, crime is high and outlooks are bleak.   All of which goes to prove that the common people just cannot run things themselves.   Being in charge takes breeding, education and a certain level of decadence.   So perhaps it is time to return to the days when you did as you were told and the British Empire ruled the world.   Of course, I would expect both Her Majesty the Queen and that idiot son of hers to abdicate; make way for some younger blood with military experience.   First step is to reclaim all our former colonies starting with America.   Then we impose a rule of absolute Monarchy and the reinstatement of the death sentence for lese majeste.   Once a sense of order has been imposed on our own fair land and our former colonies, then we can turn our attention to the lawless lands beyond our borders.    All agricultural equipment will be banned and the unwashed jobless masses can return to peasantry and work the fields.   Criminals and vagabonds will become front line cannon fodder, sorry I meant troops, and sent to the far flung corners of the world to extend our glorious borders.   Once more Britain shall lead the world and rule with an iron grip. Peace and prosperity shall return and we, the nobility, will look upon our subjects with a cruel, yet benevolent gaze.

Do you think the people convicted of smuggling Illegal Immigrants should face longer prison time up to 1000 smuggled and the Ortiz family received at least $800,000 in Western Union during a five-year period ?Five members of a Texas family were sentenced for the roles in a human smuggling operation that smuggled at least 1,000 illegal immigrants into the United States.    Prosecutors said the Ortiz family of Bryan, Texas were the leaders of a highly-organized ring that transported illegal immigrants from Laredo and other parts of the border transporting them into the Texas interior.     Five members appeared before U.S. District Judge Micaela Alvarez in Laredo on Wednesday where they received the following sentences:    Porfirio Ortiz, 38 (10 years)  Baudel Ortiz, 31, (10 years)  Calixto Ortiz, 52, (6 years and 3 months)  Bernardino Ortiz, 49 (6 years and 3 months)  Sandra Ortiz, 32 (4 years and 7 months)    All defendants except Sandra Ortiz were ordered to pay a $5,000 fine.

20090130192325AAwnVOt	Politics & Government;Immigration	Do You Think Florida Budget Crisis Would be Lessened by Ending Illegal Immigration Costs?	WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Florida's lawmakers now grappling with a budget deficit estimated at $2.3 billion, were advised three years ago of the mounting costs of illegal immigration in the state.         In 2006 The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) issued a study of the fiscal cost of illegal immigration to Floridians. At that time, the cost to the state's taxpayers was $1.735 billion dollars a year. That estimate included the cost of educating the children of illegal aliens - both those illegally in the country and those born here - in K-12 public schools, emergency medical care, and incarceration of criminal aliens.          While these annual costs for illegal immigration have been steadily eroding Florida's budget, a new estimate for 2009 would be even higher and represent even greater strain on the state's resources. The 2006 cost estimate was based on an illegal alien population estimated at 630,000 persons. Today, FAIR estimates Florida's illegal alien population has risen to 950,000 persons, a fifty percent increase. As a result, the current fiscal cost outlays for the illegal alien population in Florida now amount to more than $2.8 billion annually.         "Fixing the Florida economy means acknowledging the real cost of illegal immigration," said Dan Stein, President of FAIR. "A big chunk of the state deficit could be lessened over time if the state adopted measures that effectively complemented federal efforts to deter new illegal immigration."          "During a period when Floridians are losing jobs and scrambling for limited state services, it is fundamentally unfair to Floridians to fail to deter illegal aliens from seeking employment, residence and benefits in the state. Florida's policymakers have a clear obligation to not ignore the budget-busting costs of illegal immigration and make policy adjustments that get the state fiscally healthy," observed Stein.     http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.a...

20090130180358AAEf731	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Does being a member of the presidents party turn people into jerks?	i noticed that in the past 8 years -- although there are always nasty people on both sides -- the GOP has been especially poisonous, definitely housing more unstable hatred than any other party. or so i thought.      ever since obama was elected, i've noticed a big switch; first with all the liberals saying "get over it, you lost" and now more and more libs getting nasty with the insults. meanwhile, the conservatives are getting as cocky as Bush-era liberals, confident that obama will fail. both sides are taking the other's place.       is it defensiveness that makes people snap at those who criticize their president? arrogance? are they trying to hide their own disappointment?

20090130190030AAuOocY	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why is there even debate over this stimulus package?	Admittedly, some of it may be fluffy - the state department's new computers, and the Ag building's renovation are two I don't care for - but the majority of the bill will create new jobs in a very tangible way.  How on earth can any American right now not want that to happen?      The government gave billions of billions of dollars to institutions with shoddy business practices and there hasn't been one iota of change from it, except now they'll at least survive to the third fiscal quarter.  For once they are focusing not on the best interest of business, but on the best interest of the citizens and society.  Why is there debate about this?    Have we become such a bipartisan society that even when faced with imminent meltdown we want our side to be the winner?  We can't simply give a little to get a lot, and then go back to our bickering when things are more certain?      I, for one, don't give a crap which party it is that starts creating jobs and putting an end to this crap.  I don't care who started it, or when it started, I want it done with as soon as possible, and expect my "leaders" to make that happen without all the grade school squabbling.  Gov't should be less about donkeys and elephants and more about the good of the citizenry.    (Interesting note:  When I swore to defend this country, and while I was serving my tour, and when some of my vertebrates were shattered, and when some of my friends and our heroes were killed - not once, during any of those events was a political party spoken of, thought of, blamed or thanked. The only entity that mattered was America, why all of a sudden is America not what matters but the Republican or Democratic Party is?)

If the cops find out she lied, would she get in trouble?       The reason the officer even questioned her in the first place, was because she was a witness at the scene of my car accident. She was following me in her own vehicle. I honestly don't know why she lied, because I haven't spoken to the girl since this happened.      I'm really only curious.

20090130185342AAvoa0Q	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Confused about the progression of my father's trial of custody of daughter?	Hello. My dad has just recently divorced his second wife, with whom he conceived my half-sister. According to my dad, the wife had been cheating on my father, although I believe my dad may be having trouble proving this. Additionally, although I think it should, I am unsure whether the cheating ascept would even have any impact on the trial anyway. Now my father had just had another hearing this past week. From the details he has told me, which seem absurd, the wife had accused my father of something along the lines of child abuse. The judge then apparently ruled that temporary custody should be given to the wife (whereas from the previous hearing my father had gained temp. custody, through methods I do not know, although my guess could be around the cheating and perhaps complaints about the way the mother treated the child.) What confuses me is how the judge ruled against my father, with no evidence other than the wife's friends testifying against my dad. From what I have just been told, the act of those friend's testifying was apparently evidence enough to accuse my father. This just seems retarded to me, as that doesn't seem to qualify as sufficient evidence. I asked my father what he had tried or plans to do in his defense, and all he's told me is that his lawyer is an idiot. My question to the audience would revolve around suggestions for what my father should do, whether he has tried  anything specific already, and any questions about further details regarding the trial. I'm sorry for the lack of details but from what you have read please provide any input. Thank you.

20090130200558AAWWyN8	Politics & Government;Elections	Can Banning Donations And Having The Gov't Give Equal Press Time To Presidential Candidates Make It More Fair?	I mean these days you have to be really rich to become president. You need money for staff and TV ads and all. It is known that a person who does not "campaign" in a state is much less likely to win than a person who campaigned there a lot. So like if that person didn't have the money to campaign everywhere heavily such as purchase ads and hire staff and leaders, then they cannot make a big influence another candidate can.      I think its utter nonsense. Big companies and corporations can just make deals with presidential candidates and donate huge sums of money to that person. Then that person will purchase himself/herself a lot of TV ads and get as much awareness and influence to the people as much as possible. Does this make sense? I mean if you think about it, you really do "buy" the election. Obama, McCain, and Hillary by themselves spent much more money than any other candidate. They also received a lot of money from corporations and lobbyists. Look it up on google. Its all there.      People say Obama won the election fairly. But really did he? He received a lot of money. Therefore he made a lot of ads. Therefore he had a huge awareness. Had he not had those ads and press time, would he even have the Democratic Nomination? I highly doubt it. Same with Clinton and McCain. For you see, if a candidate is not given press time, they are not shown, and the people think they do not exist.      We had Ron Paul in this election. He was WINNING in all the straw polls, debates, internet videos, popularity all the time. Then the media stopped giving him attention, and he began to lose! Then the huge media spike started up with Clinton, Obama, and McCain and they began to pick themselves up when they should have been losing all along. Ever heard of Liberal Media? Conservative Media? We hear bias all the time. The media is owned by Big Corporations. Few Corporations. And they pick out a Candidate to give press time. When Ross Perot was allowed to participate in the debates in 1992 he got 20% of the vote. When he wasn't allowed to participate in the debates in 1996, he got only 8% of the votes. Time and time again it is shown that the Media sways Public Opinion. Even Kerry was losing badly in the IOWA polling weeks prior to the primary. Then he started using Clinton's technique of airing many ads in the state. In the end he won by a landslide when he should have lost by a landslide!      Want an example?
