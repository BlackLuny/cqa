J. 2004: page 15).     One can categorize the exercise of leadership as either actual or potential:    actual - giving guidance or direction, as in the phrase "the emperor has provided satisfactory leadership"   potential - the capacity or ability to lead, as in the phrase "she could have exercised effective leadership"; or in the concept "born to lead".

(Keep in mind you can always change your degree, especially easy early on.)    But in my opinion, between the two, I would choose Business Management, as Office Administration seems to be "under" business management therefore you could do everything you wanted to with Office Administration plus more!    I would like to add though, that basically, these two are the same.  Any job you wanted in this area would look at both these degrees and see the same thing. :-)    Don't stress over it and just choose which you feel more comfortable with. Good luck!

DC is divided in quadrants...NW,NE,SE, and SW. Most of the nicer neighborhoods are in the NW. A few neighborhoods to check out are Cleveland Park, Woodley Park, Dupont Circle and Logan Circle.

AA12066778	Not exactly.    International market strategy deals with the planning and vision as to how to market goods/services across national boundries.  This includes dealing with trade restraints, pricing issues (including transport costs and tariffs), etc.    Internationalization deals with the specific details involved in marketing the goods/services in the foreign market.    A classic example of this is the urban legend regarding Chevy Nova.    According to the tale, the car sold very well in the US, but no matter what they did, the car failed to meet sales expectations in Mexico.  They had marketed similar vehicles using similar strategies and had seen good sales.    Why did the Nova fail to sell?  Quite simply, in Spanish, "no va" means "doesn't go".    They supposedly changed the name to the Chevy Caribe and saw sales improve.    Note that this is an urban legend, but it does demonstrate the point that internationalization can involve something as simple a s changing a name.    Hope this helps!

180954751f5a18aebf4bfd73f2ad6b99aa	Here are my thoughts as a former franchisee and someone who's done extensive research on franchising:<br>  <br>  Whether it’s worth investing in a franchise can only be answered after the fact. The best way to truly assess whether to buy any franchise is to speak directly with several (at least six, preferably more) franchisees for the company you are considering.<br>  A self-examination as to whether owning a business is what you really want is also essential, as is a very thorough due diligence. Here are 10 steps that should be taken by anyone considering investing in a franchise:<br>  <br>  1 - Conduct due diligence on yourself<br>  2 - Find a great accountant<br>  3 - Find a great attorney specialized in franchise law<br>  4 - Conduct due diligence on the business<br>  5 - Refresh and enhance your business acumen<br>  6 - Write a business plan<br>  7 - Identify and hire a great team- then create a culture to retain it<br>  8 - Hone your leadership skills<br>  9 - Hone your sales skills<br>  10 -Create a schedule that allows some time for family and friends<br>  <br>  Some other information you may find helpful:<br>  <br>  Most franchise contracts are 10-year commitments for which the franchisee has virtually no rights. They're structured such that the franchisee has very little latitude or say in how the business is operated. You have flexibility to hire your staff, manage them and set your own prices, but most everything else, from displays to products you may/may not carry to signage/advertising, equipment, technology, etc. is usually either governed by or subject to the approval of the franchisor. It's not like owning your own business, it's more like being a store manager who, if the business is profitable, takes home most of that. And if the business is not profitable and you want to sell it or close it after five years, these are both very difficult to do. The former is usually via either a very large fee (an example is a local franchisee who paid $100,000 to terminate his franchise contract with one of the more popular women's fitness center franchises) or personal bankruptcy (franchise contracts generally require you that you be personally liable your business debts, not just through whatever type of corporate entity you might establish; e.g., LLC, S Corp., Partnership, etc.). The latter option of selling your franchise is generally accomplished only at a very large discount.<br>  <br>  There are dozens of things to investigate when considering investing in a franchise, but here are some fundamental questions to ask current franchisees:<br>  <br>  About how many hours per week do you dedicate to your franchise business?<br>  <br>  How would you describe your relations/communications with your franchisor?<br>  <br>  Is the franchisor fair with you in resolving any grievances?<br>  <br>  Are territories equitably granted?<br>  <br>  How would you describe the initial and ongoing training provided by your franchisor?<br>  <br>  In what ways could the parent company most improve?<br>  <br>  Is your income A) more, B) less or C) about what you expected prior to opening your business?<br>  <br>  If you could turn back time to the day you signed your franchise agreement, would you make the same decision to buy your franchise?<br>  <br>  The last one is of course the most important. There are many very happy, wealthy franchisees out there, but it's not a guaranteed formula for success. Every opportunity is unique and requires extensive due diligence of both the franchise itself as well as the regulations governing the industry. If you have more specific questions, please feel free to contact me.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|MvaFgxJXaa	I don't but I work for a company that helps finance business/franchises.

Things like underwriting, investor pooling, and all sorts of fun stuff make up "the U.S. home buying situation."<br>  What we have now is a market with a ton of fraud and foreclosure at an all time high resulting from this fraud.  To make a long story very short, expect the prime rate to rise and housing prices to continue to fall until values are more realistic to the available disposable money supply.  It's not easy stuff, and I respect you tackling such a sophisticated and difficult topic.  Good Luck!

By withholding the property of rent-a-center, she is only hurting herself. Rent-a-center probably won't do anything, but it would be a lot cheaper in the long run to pay the bill.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	She will just ruin her credit rating and get a small claims action filed against her.  Then she will have to go to court, pay the money, penalties and interest anyway and still have the lousy credit rating to deal with.<br>  <br>  BAD IDEA.|`|AA10898914	They'll take her to court and it'll ruin her credit. They might try to make a deal and ask for a lesser balance to be paid. It might be her best bet. It would be better just to make a new payment plan though.|`|CvJfcqlLaa	They will probably sue her. They wil harrass her at home, at work, on her cell and everyone she listed on her contact list, if they can. Best to just either turn it over or pay the bill. If you communicate with them and try to resolve it, you might be able to save it. I would suggest keeping the lines of communication open! Remeber if it goes on her credit or goes to court, it will haunt her! She probably won't go to jail for it. If it was a car, yes if they couldn't repo it. But I doubt for a laptop. Check out the link below. I did a search.|`|GicN1B2raa	She will not go to jail for nonpayment of a computer. She has a lease contract, so this is a monetary matter. It is not stolen property, because she has a valid contract to possess the computer. But, she is obligated to pay the installments or return the merchandise or she will face being taken to court for the remaining cost plus court fees. If she cannot pay for the item now, advise her to return it and re-rent the item when she has the money available. This is common practice at RAC. The worst thing she can do is ignore them. She should contact the store manager and talk w/ him about her difficulty paying. If she has a good payment history, they will most likely work with her. If not, she should return and re-rent the computer later. All the payments she has made already will be credited once she re-rents the item. Sorry this is so long, but I do know what I am talking about. The rental industry follows different laws than other retailers, so make sure that you are following sound advice.|`|RpH0i3c3aa	they will get her one way or the other

Go to www.hounslow.gov.uk - click on "Planning Services", then "GIS", then "UDP Planning Designations map".  If you search for the name "Chertsey Road, Feltham" and find the map of the site, it shows that it is a Greenbelt and Nature Conservation Area, not a Brownfield site as they claimed.  I joined an online Google Forum called " PlotOwners" and was alerted to this by one of the online participants who is a UK citizen.|`|RX956ngOaa	A controversial company . Sold Land parcels at a risk and authorities declared it GREEN - never likely to be developed in the foreseeable future. Investors transferred into another project. <br>  Concorde Village is on the edge of HEATHROW AIRPORT (Worlds busiest) and is really brownfield - means that the developer will have to restore and detoxify as necessary as conditions of  development should it ever be approved - which one day it may, but maybe not all. <br>  Anyway restoration of brownfield is "cost on" therefore reduces the real value of the raw land in the first place.<br>  My understanding is that Taylor Woodrow has only signed an option for first refusal to develop the land if planning permission is agreed - which means nothing until the land is released. There is a lot of issues regarding aircraft noise and costly sound proofing which once again hightens the risk of making that great profit as the developer has many other land choices without such hastle.<br>  There are moves afoot within UK Government circles to consider legislation restricting such landbank companies so some are moving offshore to carry on the contraversial operations.

If you can get decent interest rates, and you have a good downpayment of 10% or more you are better off renting in this market.

Plus then you have to add on the throw away fees you would not pay while renting.. like property taxes, possbile HOA, addtional utilties, upkeep ect ect...<br>  <br>  You should sit down and factor in all those expenses and see what kind of mortgage rates you qualify for.|`|AA11267495	it is always better to own in the long run.....but you need to clean up your credit first....before you start looking to buy a house....|`|46jUarNiaa	clean your credit up first.

The only reason that people think so is, they have to save regular to pay the mortgage. A house costs you at least double as much as renting one. Rent, take the same amount of money and put it in CD's with 5-7%, or better in retirement funds. I just had a discussion with a guy, who sold his house in Toronto for 820,000. He payed 40,000 in 1956. for it. For fun, we made a calculation. If he had invested in the stock market with a decent portfolio, including dividends, he would have had 1,2 millon cash. The house actually cost him, with mortgage, renovations and taxes close to 260,000 over the years. So that was 600,000 he got out of the house, exactly half as much as he would have gotten from a portfolio.|`|UNmR6vE4aa	Working on your credit is always a good thing.

5e397564ec8bc0323d07fa5df4a25566aa	- globalisation can bring both stability due to interconnection of economies and efficiency, however also interdependance with negative effects.<br>  <br>  When we have big ecomical centres, like china, we can see that if their stock falls, this could trigger a fall in stocks around the world.<br>  <br>  Another virtue of globalisation is, that products are produced where it is cheapest. This increases both wellfare for those who can buy cheaper products as well as for those who get a job producing them.<br>  <br>  Job loss 'at home' might actually trigger a counter move with restrictions on trade etc.<br>  <br>  Another thing is that you might have unfair competition with not the same environmental rules in place around the globe.<br>  <br>  One further challange is the decreasing differences between different countries. In culture, language, etc. Losing this towards one more global identity might be considered as being a pity. <br>  <br>  Example: You can go to mac-donalds all around the globe... You might argue that it is actually a sad way of 'fear-full' people that just go to what they know instead of interact en integrate with the locals. As you see, globalisation in this respect could mean having cultures living past eachother instead of with eachother.

V6dvu6qAaa	If you aren't sure about buying right now... I don't think you should.  Wait until you are committed to the idea.  However, if you would like to live somewhere with more opportunity for yard work / home improvement ideas etc., you might think about renting a house.  Renting a small-ish house might give you some clarity on what it is you really want without breaking the bank or pushing you into a commitment you aren't really ready for.

When you have no debt and have saved about 20% of your future home's value for a down payment, only then would I consider purchasing a home.  I only say that because you are on disability and are "limited to things like yard work".  The last thing you need is a house burden again.  Good luck!|`|0awnte3Uaa	Sounds like you have already answered yourself. You are comfortable where you are at and yard work would probably become too much of a burden with owning your own home. If condo's are too expensive, most homes will probably be a little too expensive as well. You need to do what makes yourself happy. You want to be able to remain in charge of your finances and control your life and how you spend it. <br>  Renting/leasing a condo may be the way to go if you want to consider getting a change of scenery and out of your apartment. Other option may be considering moving to a new area where home/condo and apartment prices are even more reasonable. It sounds like a change of scenery is needed and moving somewhere different (change) is what you really desire here.|`|df54f1044a5b499adb758231bb8e4a90aa	Think about moving to another area where condos would be less expensive?

After that i just click and drag the cell down to get what I would get annually.  Good Luck!
02uolDJfaa	Don't worry about this! The banks can't admit the charges are unlawful as it would open them up to claims from everyone in the country, rather than the hundreds of thousands of people claiming at the moment. <br>  <br>  Everyone how has successfully claimed their bank charges back has had one of these letters, so don't let it put you off. It makes absolutely no difference in the overall scheme of things, and just been ignored!<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: I would like to point out for benefit of everyone reading these answers that the first answerer is WRONG! <br>  <br>  Bank charge claims are dealt with in the Small Claims Court if they are under ￡5000 (and if they're not you drop the amount and spread over two claims). This means, that should the very worst come to the worst and you lose (which has only happened to a couple of people out of hundreds of thousands), you DO NOT have to pay the banks costs. Obviously you don't get your charges back, and you lose the small court fee you have to pay, but you do not have to pay anything further, and don't have to pay costs.<br>  <br>  Use the steps below, and the template letters on my site and you should have a good chance of getting a full refund of your charges. My site tells you everything you need to know, and sets you up to be in the best possible position with your claim.<br>  <br>  The full process and timescales for claiming back your charges is:<br>  <br>  1) Write to the bank and ask them for a copy of your charges for the last 6 years, or alternatively a set of statements for the same period. You do this by making a "Subject Access Request" under the Data Protection Act, enclosing a cheque for ￡10 made out to the bank. This by passes the banks normal charges for statements which is normal a large amount for 6 years worth. The bank have 40 days to send you the data.<br>  <br>  2) Write to the bank asking them to refund your charges, giving them 14 days to reply, attaching a "Schedule of Charges" (a list of the charges you are claiming for).<br>  <br>  3) Send the bank a "Letter before Action" giving the bank one last chance to refund your charges before you take court action. They have 14 days to reply.<br>  <br>  4) File a claim online using the Money Claim Online web site run by the UK Court Service. The claim is served on the bank 5 days after its submitted. The bank has 14 days to acknowledge the claim. If they don't you can request a "Judgement by Default" and you win the case, and get your charges, statutory interest at 8%, and your court fees. <br>  <br>  If they do acknowledge the claim, they then have 14 days to submit a defence (making 28 days in total from the date the claim was served). If they don't then you can again request a "Judgement by Default", and get back your charges, interest and court fees as above.<br>  <br>  If they file a defence, then you and the bank get an "Allocation Questionnaire" to fill in. Some judges dismiss the case at this stage, as the bank can't win, so again you win. If this doesn't happen, a hearing date is allocated. The bank will most likely either back out before the hearing, or won't turn up in court. Again you win the case and get your charges, interest and fees.<br>  <br>  Follow the correct procedures and you stand a good chance of getting your charges back! Its important to send all letters to the bank and courts by recorded delivery, so you can prove they were received, and more importantly when they were received (which you can find from the tracking section of the Royal Mail web site).<br>  <br>  Also make sure that you send all letters to the banks head office, and not your local branch. Don't phone the bank either, as this can delay things and you have no proof of whats been said.<br>  <br>  Have a look at my site below which has detailed step by step guides to the whole process of claiming your charges back. It also has template letters you can put your details into and send to the bank, and forums for one to one advice. We also have a guide to filing your claim in court online, which is unique to the site. <br>  <br>  The site is free to use!|`|Z5p9V4Wiaa	Go to the branch and demand it, they have to give it back!

AA10423600	I have to disagree with the Spiffman's answer.<br>  <br>  The new bankruptcy law changed the rules for refiling.  If you have a chapter 7 an wish to file a new chapter 13 case, you must wait for 4 years from the date of the discharge of your previous BK.<br>  <br>  In researching this, there was a blurb about a change currently going through congress that would extend this to 8 years.  I have not found any evidence to this yet but i'm still looking.  <br>  <br>  As for a mortgage, it is extremely difficult to get a mortgage while you are in your chapter 13 plan.  The ideas is that all of your disposable income is supposed to go toward your past debts, so your trustee is going to be upset to learn you have enough to by a brand new house????<br>  <br>  All of your creditors are going to dispute any such loan.  But it does happen...you need to get it approved by the trustee and the court.<br>  <br>  As for paying...there are a lot of BK attorneys who will charge you a few hundred dollars up front to cover the filing fees.  The rest of their fee is rolled into your Chapter 13 plan.  At least most of the ones I've talked to do it.|`|tBoGedjSaa	If you go bankrupt, file your bankruptcy under Chapter 13. Chapter 13 permits an US resident to reorganize and restructure their finances. It allows you start afresh and get your finances back on the track.

Decide what you like to do.  I quit my job that I hated and love what I do know, I found a company that would hire, train, and teach me to help people get out of debt and save money, something this country needs bad......If you love what you do it doesn't make it work.

You will be very <br>  thankful you did! <br>  A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, <br>  just like you are now, and came across an article similar to <br>  this that said you could make thousands of <br>  dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of <br>  $6.00! So I thought," Yeah, right, this must <br>  be a scam", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept <br>  reading. Anyway, it said that you send <br>  $1.00 to each of the 6 names and address stated in the <br>  article. You then place your own name and <br>  address in the bottom of the list at #6, and post the <br>  article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are <br>  thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it <br>  over, and talking to a few people first, I <br>  thought about trying it. I figured what have I got to <br>  lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right? Like <br>  most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried <br>  about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked <br>  it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and <br>  they confirmed that it is indeed legal! <br>  Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... <br>  Within 7 days, I started getting money in <br>  the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but <br>  the money just kept coming in. In my <br>  first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second <br>  week I had made a total of over <br>  $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 and <br>  it's still growing. This is now my fourth <br>  week and I have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and <br>  it's still coming in rapidly. It's certainly <br>  worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on <br>  the lottery!! Let me tell you how this <br>  works and most importantly, why it works.... also, make <br>  sure you print a copy of this article <br>  NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need <br>  it. <br>  STEP 1 Get 6 separate pieces of <br>  paper and write the following on each piece of <br>  paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING <br>  LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH <br>  of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill <br>  will not be seen through the envelope to prevent <br>  thievery. Next, place one paper in each of the 6 <br>  envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed <br>  envelopes, each with a piece of paper <br>  stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a <br>  $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating <br>  a service by this. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! This program <br>  remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the <br>  participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the <br>  instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. Your product is simply a <br>  service of helping develop mail lists. Mail the 6 envelopes to the following <br>  addresses:<br>   <br>  #1) Jim P <br>  3766 Spring Green Rd <br>  Green Bay, WI 54313 <br>  #2) Stephen <br>  17025 E. Wiley Place <br>  Parker, CO 80134 <br>  #3) T Gibson <br>  8244 Hydra Lane <br>  Las Vegas, NV 89128 <br>  #4) Cinderella, <br>  1555 Jane Street #1420 <br>  Toronto, Ontario, M9N2R4 <br>  Canada <br>  #5) R.Prestia <br>  1240 Laurier dr. <br>  LaSalle, On Canada <br>  N9J 1N3<br>  #6)Nick B.<br>  3504 Condor Ct.<br>  Carmichael, CA 95864<br>   <br>  STEP 2 Now take the #1 name and address off the list that you see above, move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name and address as number 6 on the list. STEP 3 Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! ---DIRECTIONS-----HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this docment, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computers memory. Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your postings in different sittings, you'll always have this file to go back to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button. You're done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** Now the WHY part Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example). So then I made $5.00 with my name and address at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name and address at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name and address at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name and address at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name and address at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name and address at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is, do you realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will work. ALSO REMEMBER*** : : SEND YOUR $1 OUT TO EVERYONE ON THE LIST, : : EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT FROM THE U.S. : : WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? : : : : GOOD LUCK!! go to google.com and search for MAKE MONEY FAST AND EASY$$ and you will find alot of message boards !MAKE MONEY FAST AND EASY

Subsequently, Switzerland decided not to participate following a referendum, and three others joined the EU. The EEA Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2004. The EEA was maintained because of the wish of the three remaining countries - Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - to participate in the Internal Market, while not assuming the full responsibilities of EU membership.

49bd8e4dfd13cf939c3e26a19aee6070aa	Here's a blog article I wrote recently that addresses that question in part.    Namely, Australian lawyers are turning to hiring Virtual Assistants and Paralegals to reduce overhead expenses such as payroll taxes and the cost of having employees sit around on the clock when theres not real work to be done.    This is likely a problem for attorneys who are just starting in practice and dont have a regular caseload but established attorneys can have stacks of files that accumulate that need to be cleaned up too.    So, yes there is a trend towards hiring independent contractors with this sort of knowledge.     In fact, Australian based legal virtual assistants are used commonly by overseas attorneys because the time zone differences which allow, for instance, a US attorney to hand off work at "quitting time" to an Australian who may just be starting their day.|`|4e9945dfabf7fbb27929620e2deb47ddaa	thx for 2 points

Here Care Aides take an 8-10 month course that includes catheter care, but they do not insert them. However, they may apply an external (condom catheter) to a male patient. Aides here are not licensed by the provinces like LPNs, RNs, MDs, etc.    There may be "exceptions" such as a home care patient who has privately hired a care aide to take care of them. In certain circumstances, that aide (if the aide, nurse, and patient are willing) can be shown by a licensed nurse how to insert that catheter. This is really a grey area. Nurses are allowed to teach some skills, but that list is determined by the licensing authority for that province. Anything not on that list can result in the nurse losing their license. Depending on the circumstance and province, this may or may not be OK.     But *generally* speaking, in an acute/long term care setting, aides CANNOT under any circumstances insert catheters. And generally speaking, they typically ARE NOT allowed to do this in private homes either, although there *may* be exceptions. Typically an LPN or RN would be required to come in and change the catheter.|`|5EDNrOi3aa	It depends on where you work. If you work at a hospital, then you will be required to insert catheters, but if you work at some nursing homes that are skilled then you probably will have too also.
dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	error code 1201 usually means that you have a missing tax return from a previous year.  If you have not filed all your tax return from 2002 through 2007, then IRS will hold your refund (will send you a letter) asking you to file the missing tax return, and IRS will hold the refund until all your tax returns are filed and processed, processing previous tax return takes 6-12 weeks.  If you have filed all your tax returns then maybe it is just the system, if you check too often in the same day or same week it will have the system give different messages or codes.  You are to check only once weekly, the system is not updated daily.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	you need to go to the irs.gov and read the release about not putting on the stimulus check.|`|ZtS00e3paa	I am getting this same error code (1201)..wondering what is going on.
AA11284831	There's no way that you can stop him.  If he does and files first you won't be able to e-file so you'll have to file a paper return by mail.  The IRS will then automatically investigate and award the exemption according to the law.

If the other person (his father) does file a return claiming him (the son), the IRS will noticed that he (the son) was claimed by two persons (you and the father), investigate further, and disallow the claim of the ineligible person (hopefully, the father).    2) Marry the person who you do not want claimed and then file a joint return with that person.  This option is not available to you, because it is illegal to marry your own son.
zbPNN4Ndaa	The person who can claim the child is whoever the child lives with. If your son lives with you only you can claim him, if there is a problem you need to contact the IRS to let them know what is going on and they will put a red flag on his (father's) taxes because if he does his taxes wrong he will be in trouble.|`|ZB524v05aa	The irs is only going to accept the social security number coming through once, so do your taxes first.   If he happens to use it then you need to go after him for fraud.    The custodial parent is the one that gets to claim the kid on the taxes, regardless of the other parent ssupport.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	There is nothing you can do ahead of time.    You need to plan/expect that there will be years that you will have to MAIL your tax return in.  You cannot efile if any SSN on your return has been used already and y'know, the non-custodial parent has more time and energy to run down and file first.    If you normally pay to have your taxes done, ASK how much it will cost to prepare them and take the money with you.  Then if the forms can't be efiled, you pay, print, sign and mail the return.  That way the return is correct, it only adds 3 weeks to the process and get you your money.  The IRS will sort out the duplicate SSN issue--and the sooner there are two returns in the system, the sooner this can happen.    Far too many people go to a preparer, the return is rejected, they can't pay, so the preparer removes the child, shoves the return in and then has you mail in a 1040X.  This adds 4-5 months to the process and is a total waste of your time and money.|`|bf420b0aeac394f3c7221fd12f9c7ebbaa	What he does on his taxes is not your concern.  If you provided for his more than half his support, then you can claim him,  If the husband also claims him, then the IRS will have him claimed by two people and ex will have to prove how much support he provided or pay penalties.  But that's between him and the IRS.    Exception: the dependent exemption has been assigned to one of the parents by a judge in a divorce decree.|`|oiOtOD0Taa	I don't think you can physically stop him but if he files fraudulently you can report him.|`|WyQuDaRyaa	Only one person is allowed to claim your son. Once you already do so, if your son's father attempts to, you can get him for fraud. Good luck!|`|TwqIpHJLaa	You can't really forbid the father from claiming the boy, but if he does so it does not automatically mean he'll get the exemption or deprive you of taking the tax benefits for this child.      The IRS has several tests one must pass to claim a child; relationship, age, residence, support (i.e., that the child has not provided more than half his own support--the test is NOT that you or the father provided more than half).    If you and the father both claim the same child on your individual tax returns, then the IRS has "tie-breaker" rules to settle the dispute.  In your situation, were this to happen, the parent whom the child lived with the longest during the 2008 tax year will win.  This will slow down the tax refund (if any is due) processing but will not cause you to lose anything you're entitled to.    Good luck!|`|MmTe8W8uaa	There are two ways to prevent a person from claiming another person successfully:    1) File a paper (not electronic) return yourself and claim the person (your son, in this case) whom you do not want claimed by a third person (his father).

tw44fqCpaa	I thought Turbo Tax had a feature now where you don't have to go through the interview and you can go to "select specific topics".      You can go to www.pdftax.com where they have self calculating forms if your just looking to total up your Schedule A quickly.  Basically if your Schedule A is less than the standard deduction you won't itemize.  This years standard deductions are: Single or Married Filing Separate $5450;  Married Filing Jointly $10,900 or Head of Household $8000.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	If you bought turbo tax just put in the schedule A and it should use the one more advantageous to you.

fSlZQzS4aa	General rule:  Three years from the date the return was filed or three years from the due date whichever is later.    Six years if your income is understated by 25% or more.  This means income, not taxable income or tax due. The burden of proof is on IRS to show the understatement.    No limit if there is fraud.  The burden of proof is on IRS to show that fraud exists.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	It depends on the point of the audit.    If you are a wage slave (W-2s) and there is nothing special about your tax return, the rule is 3 years.    If you are a wage slave and claimed amazinging high itemized deductions because your preparer says they do that on every return and the IRS doesn't care, plan on 6 years.  Even if you aren't accused of fraud, the IRS reserves the right to audit you for 6 years if they decide you underreported your total taxable income by more than 25%.  If your preparer pads, say, 100 client  returns, all it takes is an audit of one of them to trigger an audit of the other 99...those tend to run past the 3 year window, but given the hint of fraud, the IRS will still do the audit to get the money back.  (A guy took this to tax court last year and lost.)    Officially, for fraud, there is no statute.  And if you never file, the clock never starts....|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	if you owe them they can go back as far as they want. If you are due a refund 3 yrs.|`|AA10531094	That sounds correct. . . three years.|`|AA10469473	Normally just 3.  If fraud is involved though, they'd go back farther.  And if you didn't file, they can go back any length of time.|`|oTSB5BITaa	Most of the time it is 3 years. But if intentional tax fraud is suspected, they can go back as far as they want.|`|yhZvInMAaa	About three years, unless something in the initial audit raises red flags. If you are audited, or told you owe, you have 5 years to file a tax year over using a form 1040X (the X means you have to write in the year). If you request a transcript of a particular tax year, they have to send you EVERYTHING on file for that year - even if you did not initially receive a copy (like missed W-2 forms). Since they don't figure all of your credts when they claim you messed up, you usually end up owing less than they said, owing nothing at all, or actually being owed a refund. If you refile and did not owe or are owed by them, they can't charge and fees or penalties. If you refile and still owe something, you can make arrangements or settlements.

7VnmPYuXaa	There are three classifications of an "Exempt" employee according to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).  Executive, Administrative, and Professional.  You would fall under the Administrative classification.      Your employer as the right to make you Salary Exempt if your duties include independent thinking and high level problem solving, etc.  It also states that you should not work more than 25% of your time on one specific function that can be repeated over and over again.  Under the Administrative catagory, if you perform general work that relates to operation policy and managment policy like HR, financial, misc projects, etc. your employer can definitely have you as Salary Exempt as long as your salary is above the minium wage requirements of PA which I would assume that your salary would be above minium wage.     Again, you do not need to manage or supervise employees to be Salary Exempt.  Hopefully, this answers your question and you may want to review the FLSA for more detailed information.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	Normally about all jobs that involves supervision are salaried.

It is a waste of time and will cause you unhappiness.    If you choose to be suckered in and sign up to take surveys and receive, free trials considered you were warned. The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.    A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!    Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two. The survey business is not an efficient way to make money and you are more than likely to loose money in the end.|`|0b925fbbb2713dcf75e5f37ab0e73f5faa	Yes you may want to check out http://wahjobs.blogspot.com which has a listing of companies that hire telecommuters.

NwkZ5OmCaa	Don't get ahead of yourself.    1.  The cost to renovate the office is considered a home improvement and adds to your cost basis.    2.  You would have to calculate the % of your home that the home office occupies.    3.  See publication 587 to determine/estimate how much of the expense of running the home office plus the annual depreciation you would be able to claim on a given year's return.    4.  You can't charge rent to the LLC.  You own it.  See pub 587.|`|deef86f1312d6aa410da26db3ce34134aa	Form 8829 shows all office in home expenses you can take.  There is no point in charging rent since the rent would be income to you anyway.  One big downside to deducting an office in home - when you sell the house for a gain the business portion will be taxed - no exemption is allowed for that portion.  So some people go without deducting a home office for this reason.
LUoZC3ycaa	Just answered a question similar to this.    In terms of ranking weight (where your site shows in the serps) 40% is given to on page factors and 60% is given to off page factors such as links.    Getting (quality) oneway back links is what I spend the majority of my time doing as an SEO consultant and I personally feel this is key to getting a high ranking position. However on page factors cannot simply be ignored, a lot will depend on the amount of competition in your niche.|`|vzqKVGnsaa	I believe both.

I know you have that ability too, I suggest you to work the internet. With your abilities, you can be a big-hitter.    Most of the people who asked me about business didn't even have so much money at all.  and now they are happy receiving good and decent incomes with their business.    I should say that the internet is the most powerful market yet. Billions and billions of people use the internet everyday. Therefor, all of those are potential customers. The potentiality of getting customers online is thousand times of the likelihood in getting customers in the traditional businesses.    There are variety of ways to earn online, you want me to introduce them to you. I had been on the online business for almost 2 years now, so I can say what works and what doesn't.    Here are the most popular and legal businesses I know.    1. adsense- google is gonna pay you everytime ads are clicked in your website. ($0.10- $0.5) each click. (just imagine how many people are using the internet and can click your ads) Average people earn about $600-$1000 as an estimate.    2. click bank- you choose a product on lists, there are thousands of products to sell, companies pay commissions to retailers who were able to sell their product using the link located on your website. 10-25% commissions. Average people can earn $1000-$2000 monthly.    3. HD publishings and reunion- These 2 companies pay their referers $30 each time a person conducts are research of their people search page. Whenever one gets an info and avail it from their site (which will be you site after franchising from them) you'll be honored to get the commissions. (have you ever been to a website where you can search people on the web? like their age, name, location, relatives, email address etc.) that's it. It's a big business!    4. Tissa - he owns the company called "acme-people search" He pays $30 for each referal an affiliate makes. The commissions start from $5 each for the first 30 days, if you referal stays more than 45 days, you get paid $10 additional and if they stayed more than 65  days, you get anouther $15. ( i get 20-30 people weekly)    5. GDI - they offer website hosting and domains. You can franchise their website and use it as a website of you own. You get $1 for each person you refer to get a website, and not only that, if you get like 10 people in a week, you get $200 bonus aside from the $10 commissions, say if those 10 people got 10 people each, you get a pretty $100 monthly income. If those 100 people get 10 each, you get an beautiful $1,000 monthly. If those 1000 get 1 each you get a gorgeous $10,000 monthly.    Most people earn from Gdi, $3000- $6000 monthly.  I am one of them.    i want to help you.  investment is here TIME  (2-4 hours a day), and very little money.  Just 10 usd for your website  30 usd for advertisements and you are set!
oFiGyMWraa	The proposed arrangement is quite normal. Sometimes you may have a fixed period of 12 not 6 months. And sometimes the landlords will insist on a new fixed 6 or 12 month contract instead of allowing it to a periodic tenancy (the proper name for what he is calling a rolling contract).    The landlord cannot evict you for any reason in the first 6 months of a tenancy, and he can't ask you to leave in the fixed period (if longer than 6 months) unless you breach your contract. Once you are into the periodic part of the tenancy you can terminate with a month's notice. But the landlord must still give you at least 2 month's notice as required by law.    Also, if the landlord allows the dog he has to accept the reasonable consequences that go with it. In practice unless the dog runs wild then you won't have any problems. But the same would apply if you or your family or guests ran wild.    A lot of landlords don't allow pets and don't take tenants on benefit, so I would advise that you stick with this property.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	make absolutely sure that the dog behaves, it's very difficult to find a landlord who will take them|`|Hae8acnpaa	It is difficult to rent a place if you are DSS never mind with a dog.    (DSS payments are made to the tenant and no longer can they be paid to the landlord.)    The reason landlords do not like dogs is not so much that a dog may bark but that they couse other damages, Accidents on carpets, scratching doors, leaving smells and when it comes to finding a new tenant their can be allergy problems as in dog hairs etc.    The other side of this is that if you sign a 6 month lease you cannot simply 'be out'. Your landlord has to give you proper notice. Also when the lease expires and it becomes a month to month contract he still has to give you proper notice (as do you).|`|AA11324576	most private landlords don't accept dogs. if your claiming housing benefit he's probably been burnt before by less scrupulous people than yourself. Drug dealers etc etc.    You have to remember that the long term unemployed pose a major problem in neighbourhoods across the country. Show him you can keep the house tidy and he will probably be ok. After all, its guaranteed money from taxpayers like myself.    Good luck.

NEVER attempt to buy a personal insurance (life, health, disability, annuity) product from someone who does not know you and your financial situation, or who represents a specific company.

It is possible that not enough is being withheld if you had other income with no withholding (interest, investments, etc.).

Then you file together and combine incomes and your tax bracket changes.      Looks like this year you got the federal right - keep your refund low but don't owe - why give them your money all year.  One of you should redo your state W4 to have an additional $10/week taken out to make sure it doesn't happen again next year.|`|fvN18yvGaa	Sure ur state didnt change the with hold percentage...I suspect with whats going in the economy alot of that will happen..

Did you have anything like that during 2008?    Another possibility is that your employer made a mistake on your withholding OR that you changed your withholding (from something higher than zero) to zero too late in the 2008 tax year to offset the earlier inadequate withholding.    Hope this helps.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Easy.  Uneven income, income above $40,000, anything.

AA12340500	Although I have never worked at Walmart, Meijers or Kmart, I have worked at Target.  My experience there was horrible, and I consider it to be the worst job that I ever had.  However, my friend went to work there and she loved it.  I think that this was because she did not work on the front end like I did.  Everyone in the store treated the front end like they were the scum of the world.  So if you go to work at Target, don't work at the front end.  I have also heard that Walmart is really bad to their employees.  Stories I have heard include bad benefits, and forced overtime.|`|AA10867743	Walmart treats their employees like sh t.

oFiGyMWraa	It is perfectly legal to sign a lease over to someone else. Both the landlord and the tenant can do it. It is called "assigning" and the assignee takes on all the benefits and responsibilities. However, the lease itself may prevent assignement, or it may place extra restrictions, such as requiring the landlord's consent.    This is nothing to do with subletting, which is something else entirely.    Very long leases, which are usually called leasehold, can last for 10s or even 100s of years. Short leases, such as a standard residential tenancy may be periodic and can be terminated at any time with only a month's notice.    In law there is no difference between these different sorts of lease. However, in long leases assignment is almost certainly allowed - after all no individual will survive for a term of 125 years. In periodic residential tenancies assignment is often not allowed. Some leases have statutory rules that give the tenant security and allow it to pass to family.    So whether your father can assign his lease depends on what kind of lease he has, and what the terms of that lease are.|`|	Go to the Citizen Advice Bureau and ask them, they know everything.

Fa6yfvl4aa	Offering 200k on a 250k house is kind of low balling.  It may be a jumping off point for negotiation or they may outright refuse the offer.  You're asking for 20% off the price they think is fair.  It's worth a shot.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Offering 80% of the asking price when the house has been on the market for a month is probably low-balling it. The owners may consider it insulting--or they may leap at the chance to get out with 200K in cash.    I think you should contact a realtor who will act as your agent and see what s/he thinks. They know the market in your specific area and even in that specific neighborhood, and can contact the seller's agent to ascertain whether the offer is a possible starting point for negotiation or a slap in the face.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	I have only heard that things are really bad in Michigan, I have no direct knowledge.

I don't understand why he'd want you to when your dog might do damage again. If he gives you an eviction notice there will be a hearing. You don't need anyone there. If you tell the judge you have intention to replace the carpet when you leave he may side with you. If he doesn't you'll be given 30 days to move.|`|AA10725997	Different states have different laws. You should find out what your state and or city laws are regarding tenant rights    They are not out of line to have the property maintained as per your lease. Property inspections of the premises are done for just that reason. Their concern is that you will not pony up to pay for the carpet. I doubt that your deposit plus pet deposit covers that and any other damage you or your dog might have done.     This seems a bit silly if the dog is still there and you might incur the same expense when you move out.    I would suggest you add to your deposit and agree in writing that this money is for new carpet when you move so that you will not be double charged for the same problem.|`|3yrpDNavaa	If you are on a month to month, then the landlord can legally end your tenancy with 30 days notice, for ANY reason at all.      Otherwise, the carpet is your business, not the landlord's.  If you were on a lease, the landlord would not be able to evict you, prior to expiration of the lease, just because the carpet is damaged.  But, you are month to month -- so, that doesn't apply.

5BTKscZraa	They will take one of two actions: charge-off your account and sell it to a debt collector, which will try to annoy you into paying...or...they will take you to court to try to get a judgment...which may lead to wage garnishment and freezing of your checking account. It's impossible to predict which path they'd take. Either way, after six months of non-payment your accounts(s) will be charged-off and this will stay on your credit report for seven years. A charge-off is a HUGE black mark on your credit report. Do whatever you can to prevent this from happening.     Contact your local Red Cross for a referral to the local Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) in your area. They can negotiate much lower payments and interest rates. They DO NOT negotiate settlements.    They will require you to stop using all credit and to cut up your cards. Your credit report will be updated to "enrolled in debt management." This does not damage your credit, but it may make it impossible to obtain new credit while you are enrolled in their program....so don't use this service if you anticipate applying for a new apartment, car loan or mortgage anytime soon, as you would probably be denied while you're enrolled in the CCCS debt management program....

QoVL5cDHaa	You are being taxed because employer is not doing his job properly if he has not asked you to complete form P46. Pursue it with him, and tick the right boxes.  If that doesn't work, contact tax office. Give staff your employment history (even if only full-time education) since the beginning of the tax year, 6th April, and ask for cumulative code number to be issued. Tell them you are being incorrectly taxed at Basic Rate. Employer will then make any refund due with wages. The chances are that they won't have a record for you, as employer hasn't sent in your National Insurance number or that he is employing you. A tax office record can be set up using a temporary number, but if you know yours, they will use that, so have it to hand..  Tax is normally calculated on a cumulative basis. You haven't said if you are paid weekly or monthly. You can earn 502 a month or 116.06 a week before you have to pay tax. So you will have a backlog of unused tax allowances to set against earnings for this tax year.  For NI, when you are 16 or over, you can earn 455 a month or 105 a week before you get deductions. That is based on each payday. Other earnings for year aren't relevant.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	If you work, you get taxed, welcome to the real world. Call the tax dept and determine the right tax bracket then call hr at your work and let them know. regardless if they are wrong, when they work it out they will pay it back.
SqPVrEaCaa	generally, these questions only apply to your immediate household|`|3F8bCZ55aa	It usually refers to those in your immediate household.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	I would expect they are asking about immediate family members.

dPLkNRNuaa	No.    The homeowners policy does not provide liability or medical payments coverage for residents of the insured home.     You can not sue yourself for causing injury to yourself. Therefore, your liability coverage does not apply.

AbCeEZIhaa	You would win but not damages or any significant amount beyond your check. You have 2 issues at play. A federal one and a civil one. Your check, if you wanted, was due to you at midnight the day of your last regularly scheduled pay date - that has long since passed.     The civil issue is the money.

2uiuOpSvaa	You are getting some completely wrong advice here, which suggests that this is NOT the place to get tax advice.  I will give you an accurate answer, but you should check out the sources below, not just take my word for it.    Short answer: No, he cannot claim you child.  All of the requirements are met for he to do so EXCEPT the child is not his child, sibling, step-child, or foster child.  So, the child is not a "qualifying child" for your boyfriend and cannot be claimed as a dependent by him.    For the same reason, your bf cannot file as head of household.  And you cannot file jointly or married unless you were married by end of last year.    You can claim the children as dependents, of course, and should file as head of household.    You cannot, as at least one person suggested, file for a common law marriage.  First, you don't file for one, it just happens.  And, more significantly, common law marriage has been abolished in the vast majority of the states.    The good news is that the persons who thinks you need marriage AND adoption of your children are also wrong.  He can claim them as dependents if he adopts OR if you are married.  Adopted or step children are qualified children for tax purposes.    So, while it is unfair that you are raising children in the same situation as married people but you children don't get the same subsidy from the federal government through tax breaks, that is, in fact, the way the law is set up to penalize people who do not get married.  (Just be glad you are not a same-sex couple, many of whom are also raising children together.  This is one reason they want the right to be married, rather than civil unioned or nothing at all.)|`|J7GTIE5raa	he can claim the child but its illegal. people do it all the time even though they arent supposed to. you should claim him.|`|8KbcQGL0aa	You had to have been married in 2008 as well as him adopting the children.

One of them, the Relationship Test states:  To meet this test, a child must be:    Your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant (for example, your grandchild) of any of them, or    Your brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant (for example, your niece or nephew) of any of them.|`|bAulU9v1aa	No.  Single for him.  Possible Head of Household for you with 3 dependents.|`|yhZvInMAaa	http://www.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxe...    They do not qualify under the rules because he is not a blood relative and/or has not adopted them. This is a little table from the IRS that explains it all.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	if your boyfriend has not adopted the child then no. he has no gardianship over the child. you arent married either so that also says that he cant. sorry|`|AA10469473	NO he can't claim any of your children.  If your income was under $3500 for the entire year, he might be able to, but since you made over that, the kids are YOUR qualifying children, so he can't claim them.      You will both file as single, assuming that you are.  You can claim your children.  The only other person you could allow to claim them is their biological father, and that doesn't sound likely or reasonable.    And a few of the other responders gave you very bad info.  To claim head of household you'd have to show that you paid over half of the expenses of keeping up the household - unlikely with those incomes, plus you say in your question that you didn't, he did.  And as for common law marriage, it takes a lot more that just living together, and would have to have been in effect in 2008 - and most states don't even have it any more.|`|oiOtOD0Taa	The child can be a step child, not just biological or adopted.    sorry, missed that you are not married.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Unless there's proof they're his kids,no,he can't do that.

63e4b2a381a37a2a4e488d966800a454aa	If you had a net loss of $3000 or less, you can claim it on your taxes. You need to figure the initial cost and the sale proceeds of each transaction as well as the date bought and sold and transfer that information to schedule D.   The dates will determine if you have a short term or long term gain or loss.    Example, if your first purchase was 100 shares of XYZ company at $10 per share, your cost would be $1000. If you later sold those 100 shares at $6, your net loss would be $400.  If next you purchased 500 shares of ABC company at $3 per share, your cost would be $1500. If you later sold them for $4, your net gain would be $500. So your combined net gain/loss for both transactions would be $100 gain. And you would pay tax only on the $100.    If your total net losses for the year were $1000, you would do the calculations on Schedule D and transfer the net loss to Form 1040. The $1000 loss would reduce your taxable income by $1000, thereby reducing your taxes.    If you need more help with this, you might want to have a professional prepare your taxes.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	The good news is, you were able to import the trades and not have to type them all over one by one.    The bad news is, if you had done the work yourself, you'd understand this better.    The IRS doesn't look at your "overall" picture, but the totals on the schedule D.  Obviously any sale at a gain shows up as a gain.  It's the loss calculations that affect you.  Only sales prior to 12/31 will be on the schedule D.  Paper losses (meaning you still had the stock but knew it wasn't worth anything) don't count until you sell.         Worse, you can sell, but if you were rebuying the same company's stock (day traders have their favorite stocks) within 30 days of the sale, the losses are considered a "wash" and disallowed.  The loss is added to the basis of the repurchased stock and when it's finally sold you get the loss....unless you bought the stock again.    So you may be down $1000 in the account, but appear to have $4000 in taxable gain and a cost basis on the remaining stock of way more than $1800.    (All of the posts are good--I hadn't even thought to ask if your schedule D showed any cost basis amounts.)|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	you can't just put the total , you have to list each sell with purchase date sell date and your basis. What schedule did you use?|`|AA10469473	If you had a net loss, no you won't be taxed.  Sounds like you just imported the sale numbers, without the bases.    But you'll have to show each trade, including your basis in what you sold which is normally what you bought it for, then figure amount of loss or gain for each, then add them up, keeping short term and any long term transactions separate since they are treated differently taxwise.   Short term is anything you held for a year or less; long term is a year and a day or more.|`|tw44fqCpaa	The only thing pertinent is the actual trades.  Not what your account balance is right now.  Instead of importing - manually enter your trades and see if that fixes the problem.

If it's the latter, how many days were they in the US? Can they claim a closer tie to (india?)?  If they do not have green cards and were in the US less than 183 days in 2008, chances are they are considered non-residents due to their closer ties to their home country.    Even if you pass all the tests for substantial presence test, do you have all the documents to PROVE you paid 51% of their support while in both countries?|`|AA11828439	no|`|xBd96wvRaa	They have to have lived with you for 51% or more of the year.

MmTe8W8uaa	The laws on lease-breaking are set by state law, not federal law, and therefore vary tremendously from state to state.  To receive a correct answer you must identify the state where the apartment is, and then ask someone familiar with the unique laws of that state to answer.    In some states, you may have the option to "sublease" (allow someone else to live in the apartment and pay the rent for you).    In nearly all cases, if you simply stop paying the rent, the owner will eventually evict you, at which point you will not be charged rent for months after the month when you are forced to leave.  However, you will hurt the owner financially, you will destroy your credit and your ability to rent elsewhere, and you will still owe the rent for the months when you where leaving in the apartment, and may also owe for the cost of evicting you (attorney's fees, etc.).

tvUAO4ioaa	Well, just as you pay good money to rent, so do your neighbors. If something escalates to the point that cops need to be called (and you, yourself admit it got pretty bad) your landlord can ask someone to not re-enter the property and can evict you.     Most leases state that if you cause excessive noise to your neighbors, you can be evicted. When you meet up with her to speak, simply tell her you understand and that this won't happen again. Hopefully, if you abide by the limitations she has set, she won't evict you.|`|PxoKseAiaa	She owns the property, so it doesn't matter *how much* money you pay to live there, it is apparent this boyfriend of yours caused issues and she has irate tenants on her hands. Easier to ban him and possibly evict you than have to deal with other tenants. And, as you already know, you were wrong, and you would probably be just as pissed if someone who lived near you had a couple who fought and cops were called.  That stuff is upsetting!      If I were your neighbor, I would hope the landlord kept the boyfriend off the property.  Go see this b/f on his turf if he is so important to you.  Don't make your neighbors lives miserable.|`|AWSmknxLaa	1) She can evict you    2)  She can keep your boyfriend off the property    I would look for a new place to live that has no close neighbors    Better yet,  find a boyfriend who is not so out of control.

8ohAAwrEaa	Usually, when you're "on-call", you are on a slaried position.  Are you salaried?  If you are, you are getting paid!    If not, you'll just have to ask yourself how much you like your job.  With the economy and job market the way it is, now is NOT the time to start making noise!    Also, generally, you're only on call for a certain amount of time, like one week you're on call.  The next week it's someone else.  Is this the case?  If it isn't, try bringing that idea up.  ------------------  EDIT:  With your additional information, that is terrible!  If you have a union, I suggest contacting them.  Otherwise, I'd start looking for a new job.  The best solution is to talk to a lawyer, but that's probably not financially feasible.      Are you truly "on call"?  Or do they just call the next person they have possible to work?  Do you have dedicated times that you're on call or is it all the time?|`|AHCelSY1aa	I'm in the U.S. so not sure how it works in Canada but I would imagine they have some type of agency like we do (The Department of Labor) that you can contact.  Here in the U.S. what you are describing would fall under wage and hour laws and the person must be paid regardless if they are salaried because more than likely they wouldn't even meet the FLSA laws to be an exempt employee.  Regardless, if you have such an agency in Canada that's who you need to contact.

Research online everything you can about the company, and love it :D    Yum yum thinking of that store makes me drool...    Um... basically what you need to assure them of is.. "How will this person sell buckle to the people who buy from buckle?"    and "How will this person make people want to come back to buckle?"    So think about this, then how you can fit in.

Be bold, have charisma.  And if they don't hire you then that's how it is.  Just walk in chill, walk out chill.    Write a thank you letter, and follow up.  Follow up until they tell you to stop calling.  Make sure when you call you have a definite way of getting their attention, making them remember you.    Persist... are there other buckle stores around you?
79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	For gaining traffic to your website without cost, you will be looking at some time being spent.    Back links are very important and can arguably be the best way to increase your website exposure. Effective back links are one way links (meaning not a link exchange) from other websites to yours. For example, had you put a link to your website in your question, you would have created a back link as yahoo instantly indexes the Q&A section of their website. Even Google picks it up. You can build back links in placing your url in ads such as craigslist, creating or comenting on blogs on wordpress and myspace as well as other blogging websites. These are all methods that give you white hat back links.    There is also a new website that has grown in Alexa (an independant website ranking company) by over 18,000,000 in just three weeks called www.SayItAloud.com that allows you to write articles that, if they are sponsored, will actually pay you for your article.  They have a sales staff that prmotes your writings to related companies who would be interested in advertising on your site and pay you up to $135 per article.  The site is not officially launched but several people have made money and they have over 200 people writing right now.  You can promote your site in both your profile and articles.  You can use the money you get from there to utilize some paid methods.    Caution: do not pay for your back links through back linking companies. This is considered black hat SEO and will actually drop your ranking or get you suspended all together from the big boys of search engines.    SIA Professional Services has an articles section in their website which has a ton of website marketing tips that should help you at www.siaservices.net just go to their blog or their articles section.    Be sure you are submitting your website on a regular basis, especially whenever you are doing some good updates on your site. The search engines will see your site being updated on a regular basis and index you accordingly. There are some free submission sites, but I have seen in my experience that those don't nearly perform as well on a regular basis as professional SEO and marketing companies.    There is plenty more that you can do, but hopefully this give you a good starting point.    Good Luck and hope this helps|`|Z8oZGwE3aa	Some of the ways you can advertise your website and increase traffic are:  1.

OacSIfSiaa	Mortgage brokers used to just go by ones score and their reports.  This is why we are now in the mess we are in.  Too many did not bother to verify employment records, income sources and whether or not a family could afford the home.    It was all greed, get that commission and move the property.    Now is it back to what it used to be.  The do not rely on just your credit report or score.  They pull your income tax records to verify employment.  They also factor in what are the chances you might loose your job, how much to you make (net income) and would you be able to afford the mortgage which includes the PITI factor that many home buyers forget about.  PITI is short for Principle (amount of loan), Interest, Taxes and Insurance costs averaged out over a 12 month period.  If you property taxes rise, so does your mortgage payment.    Those loans with the variable rate APR are what hurt so many people.  It was a teaser to sell the property and now that no lenders will make loans, we are all taking a loss.|`|mwkfirjRaa	Most mortgage loan applications go through an automated underwriting process, which considers the score, credit history, loan to value ratio and other characteristics.  If the loan is approved through the automated process, then no one really "looks" at anything.    If the loan cannot be approved through the automated underwriting process, then some lenders are authorized to use a manual underwriting process.  Others just end the loan review if the automated process rejects the loan.     The score and the loan to value ratio are commonly used to determine pricing - that is to say, how much the loan will cost in terms of the interest rate.    If the automated process approves the loan, then the borrower(s) are asked to provide substantiation for what they represented in the loan application.  This would include, for example, pay and employment verification, asset verification, deposit verification, tax records, etc.|`|NYUgWQNAaa	Lenders use your credit score to get a quick hint of your credit history, but the information on your actual credit report is what they ultimately use to make a determination as to whether or not you will get the loan that you are applying for and what your interest rate will be.    A credit score is based on factors such as your history of paying your bills, such as loans, credit cards, and other credit obligations. Public records such as tax liens, bankruptcies, judgments, law suits and collection accounts are also factored into the score.

oiOtOD0Taa	Ebay gets the traffic that a lot of others don't get. You can try Amazon but categories are limited if you are not an authorized dealer.    Since ebay fees can get high, consider this:    *How many items can you buy, photograph and list in a week?  *Of them, how many will sell? (check through sold listings for those items)  *How much money do you want to make, after fees?  *Divide how much money buy how many you think you can sell and so determine how much profit you need per item...    Then work on looking for products that give you that return    Examples, might be finding a wholesaler. Electronics do well but very competitive.  Selling lots of the same products is less time consuming so you can get more listed in a week.    Buy collectibles at auctions and yard sales. Potentially there is lots of mark up but more time and research involved    Buy close out stock, or clearance items at close out stores, like Marshalls and TJ Maxx. Avoid the Chinese junk, but look at things like quality clothing & linens.     Become a Trading Assistant - that is, charge people to sell their household stuff for them. They cover fees and you get a % of the profit.

ZeDjn4cVaa	Your situation is unclear, but I'll assume that you are paid to drive a truck and your employer adds $57 for each day that you are away from home to cover your meal expenses, etc. and that this amount paid by your employer to you is included in your wages reported in Box 1of your W-2.  (If this is not your case, then please pose another question clarifying your situation so that it can be answered.)    You are allowed the per diem appropriate to your work.  Since you drive all over the US, the general rate (CONUS) seems to apply to you , which is $39/day for meals and miscellaneous. See IRS publication 1542 for mored etail son  the per diem. If your work is subject to Department of Transportation hours of service rules, then you are allowed as a deduction 80% of your cost of meals. It used to be 75%, but it recently increases to 80%, but the software program would have given  you the 80% deduction whatever the preparer might have said.  Of the $39 per diem, $36 is for meals and $3 is for miscellaneous, so you are allowed a deduction of $31.80/day (= 0.80 * $36 + $3) or $28.80 for meals and $3 for miscellaneous.    Your employer may give you $57 per day to cover the additional taxes you owe due to the per diem and the only partial deduction.      If you stay at hotels while on the road instead of sleeping in your truck you may also deduct  actual hotel expenses with receipts.

nXzt7bm6aa	You need to take the same high school classes as any pre-medical program - chemistry, physics, anatomy and physiology if offered. The med bio sounds interesting, but only your school counselor can tell you if it is suggested for pre-med prep. The hardest part about becoming a P.A. is the same problem with becoming a doctor: getting into the program. Find a school that offers P.A. and do exactly what they suggest for getting in to the program. If possible, talk to some of the folks taking the program [or graduates] because sometimes admissions says one thing but you find that reality is somewhat different. Example: the program I was trying to get into had so many applicants that the only way to get in was if you were working as an EMT or similar type job in a hospital.

G3P5htn7aa	I filed as well with H&R Block on 1/16. I was turned down for the RAL and converted to an RAC which meant that I should have gotten my check within 8-15 days. The irs did not even acknowledge receiving my refund until 1/22 which I thought was odd considering e-files are usually recognized within 1-3 days. The irs website gave me a refund date of 2/3 but when I rechecked it on 1/29 the date was changed to 2/24. When I called the h&r block rep she said my refund delay was due to the recovery rebate credit as the irs are doing them manually.   Why bother paying a tax preparer to do my taxes if the irs is going to redo it manually and hold my refund up, what a waste of money.  If the h&r block rep told me correctly and the delay is due to the rrc then why hold up my entire refund instead of just the rrc amount. None of it makes any sense to me, it stinks that we filed so early and will have to wait so long for our refunds. I wish I had some concrete answer to give to you, I can only share what my rep told me was my situation.  Unfortunately all we can do is sit and wait and hope that we get our refunds a lot sooner than expected.  In reference to some thing the guy above me said.....  The h&r block  rep did say that the irs changed the way the preparers do the rrc 3 different times.    In response to your additional info:  To avoid any more disappointment I would expect a refund on 2/24. If it comes early it will be a nice surprise. :-)   Some times we have to find the good in the bad. Keep your fingers crossed and I will too.|`|AA10469473	The abnormally high refund is probably the reason your return is being reviewed, especially if it has EIC which is known to be a high-fraud area. If every thing on your return is legit, you should be OK even though your refund will be a little later than you expected.    At 8 am on 1/16 I'd be very surprised if you were the second person in the nation to file.   But that really doesn't matter.  And if your refund comes on 2/24 you'll hardly be one of the last to get your refund.    Separate question rew your additional details that just showed up - why in the world are you having that much deducted?  You are just giving the government  a large interest free loan.

Why make such a large interest-free loan to the federal govt?      If you're receiving EIC (the earned income tax credit) it may well have triggered some follow-up inquiry by the IRS.  If you or H&R made an error with respect to the economic stimulus payment you received last year, many of these returns have been delayed for review/correction.  Another hazard of being one the first to file is the H&R office might not have worked the bugs out of their software yet this year...     Hope they get it cleared soon!|`|85kO97bEaa	You are not alone...from what I understand, several people did not get their refund deposited today, as initially scheduled, Jan 30.   My "expected" date now says 2/24/09, although on IRS.gov there is a posting about tax delays beingbogus...obviously refunds are being delayed for some reason since every year that I have efiled, I've received my refund within 10 days. I e-filed on Jan 19 & my return was accepted on Jan 19...I only know two people who did receive their refunds, and the funny thing is, it wasn't on Friday Jan 30, it was early on 1/28!!  ****I also have two children and pay for childcare, I am curious how your refund is so large?? Seems impossible?? I doubt you are being audited, the IRS starts auditing around December. I was audited last year and just got my notice here in Jan. The materials they sent me explain that auditing usually begins December of each year...good luck!|`|wQJBFcluaa	How do you know you were the second person in the nation to e-file?Did the IRS tell you this?And even if you were,what does it matter?|`|4mmTyMglaa	If your refund is 13000, you need to redo your exemptions on your W-4s to get less taken from each paycheck.  The IRS does take a very close look at returns that come in with huge refunds to make sure the people are paying the correct witholding and not creating false deductions.      Added: "my federal withheld amount of around 8k matches the w2 my employer sent me"    Then you definitely need to talk to your employer to get less taken from each paycheck.  Then you have more money during the year.    If you want to know the date you will get it, you will have to call IRS.  If they are still processing the return, they will only be able to estimate.  And they will not be able to tell you exactly why it was delayed (mostly because the reps and supervisors that you talk to do not work in the processing dept).|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Refunds of more than $10k are automatically de-queued from the automated processing system for further review by a human.  The odds of further delays on a return claiming a refund of $13k are high unless the refund is due to an overpayment of estimated taxes that have been recorded on the IRS systems already.

If you dont have names, call the front desk, ask this specifically - "can you tell me the name of your marketing director, I work with (your company) and we would like to send some information over." Don't ask to speak with them, thank them for your time. Don't send anything through, its a waste of time.     A week or so later call back - and ask for them directly. You're in.|`|TEIVlHW9aa	Register as a business for the Natinal Do No Call Registry, you'll be able to search up to 3 area codes for free. Some people who have registered will not show up for 30 days, but they're informed on this.     I'm not sure what you're calling for, but you should be able to register as an Indpendent Contractor without any problems.     Hope that helps.

WuDXQGBgaa	yes,unless you'll file a injured spouse claim form 8379 to protect your wife's portion of the refund.don't file a seperate return because of this,just attach that form to you'll married/joint return.    just to let you know,filing this form will delay your wife's refund for about 11 weeks if filed with you'll tax return but you'll can file the form by itself by mail about a week after filing you'll return which will only delay her refund by 8 weeks then.it's worth the wait if she can because if she files married/seperate she'll pay higher taxes and lose all credits she may qualify for.    you'll can probaly e-file the return on turbotax.com for free also,but wait to file the form by mail by itself.    good luck !|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	The entire refund on a joint return is subject to capture for any debts owed by either of you.  If you file jointly she can attach Form 8379 to protect her share of any refund.    While you can file separately, that will most likely result in paying more total tax.  You also lose out on a number of tax benefits on separate returns, most notably the EIC.|`|VXkOZ4rEaa	if you MFJ yes they sure will but if they know your married and you file single they may still take it
4mmTyMglaa	RALs generally cost $300 - $400 with the prep fees and bank fees and all.|`|AA11284831	They hit you with fees and interest charges that can add up to over 2,000% APR for the week or so that they lend you the money.  On top of that, if the RAL is denied, you will still be hit with a "convenience charge" of at least $30 or so for processing your refund though their partner bank.    They won't give you a RAL for $8,000.  And if most of that is from the EIC, FTHB or other refundable credits, they won't give you a RAL for more than the excess tax that was withheld from your pay.    Save yourself several hundred in rip-off fees.  Pay the prep fee in cash or put it on your credit card and have the refund sent directly to YOUR bank by the IRS.  Don't use their Emerald Card either.  It has ridiculous fees for what little that they actually do for you.|`|TwqIpHJLaa	The finance charge is 1.07% of the loan amount, which is a 36% APR (annual percentage rate). The refund account fee is $29.95.      The fees are absolutely obscene.  Don't do it...  Congress passed a law last year, for example, forbidding military families from taking RAL loans because the interest charges are so high.    The IRS is pretty darn fast now-a-days about making refunds, especially if you use direct deposit.  Let's say you had your income taxes transmitted electronically on 28 Jan...you'd have the refund sent to your bank on 6 Feb...and not have to pay the greedy H&R, Jackson-Hewitt middle-men.|`|96107c5bf43893adbb0a8444778f9812aa	Do not use h and r!

61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Hi,you should get your p45 when you leave your job or a week after.When you get it give it to your new employer.  Good Luck|`|S8RL9lieaa	When you receive your pay.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Most employers usually post out P45s within a month of the contract ending. You need to keep the front page of it and give the 2 back pages to your new employer. If you do not have this when you have started work ask them to get you a P46 form, this can be used instead of the P45 so that you get put on the correct tax code. If you are earning within the tax allowance for the year you will not be taxed anyways. You will only be paying NI.     See link below.|`|LFYr9iH0aa	A P45 will be completed when they next do the wages. If you are paid monthly, it will be at the end of the month.    If you can't wait, just fill in a P46 instead and get your employer to send it off. I thought now that rather than being on a tax code of BR, they would put you on the current allowance rate of say 603L anyhow. I thought I read that when the Inland Revenue sent some info through a while back.|`|QoVL5cDHaa	You won't get form P45 until you either leave job, or get last pay. Current employer will want to make sure it is correct and complete. You can give it to new employer when you get it. If there is any delay, new employer can ask you to sign a form P46 to say that is your only or main job. That will be superseded when form P45 arrives.  Signing a form P46 results in emergency tax. However approximately correct amount of tax should be deducted, and you will still get your tax allowance. It only means that tax isn't calculated on a cumulative basis.
YgEOEqNRaa	I don't know what bud68's talking about, he's creepy & yes it is creepy as heck|`|dniMLHETaa	Life insurance for a child is cheap once the child is over about 2 years, they are then past child birth risk.  At that point they are rated on common actuary tables and have a live expectancy of 70 to 75 years.  If you keep up the premiums for 75 years you will have paid a lot into the policy.  Compare that to a 50 year of with the same life expectancy and it is understandable why the child's premiums are so low.

The reason you put insurance on a child/baby.....it's very cheap. A burial could cost $10,000 or more. If the child/baby were to die, you would now have the money to pay for the burial and funeral expenses. Or, should the child later develop a medical condition that makes them un-insurable, all you have to do is keep the policy that was in place on them as a child paid.

But it is not easy and takes a good understanding of finance. That's why many people use investment advisors. The best advisors are those who charge a fee for their services. Free advisors are not objective and will always lead you to investments from which they earn good commissions.    It is difficult to answer your question because there is not enough information. An advisor will want to know your age, your income, level of savings, level of debts, family status and many other things before a good investment plan can be formulated.     Since you are interested in investing, you may wish to examine an IPO intended for small investors. IPOs are typically available only to wealthy individuals but this one is too small for them to consider. So the venture is looking for investors who can invest as little as $100. The risk is high, but the returns on such investments can be astronomical, and in this case if you lose $100 it will not kill you financially.

NEjjNmfyaa	Two terms to understand here are insured life and beneficiary.  The insured life is who needs to pass away for the death benefit to become payable.  The beneficiary is who is designated to receive the death benefit.  If your loved one is also listed as the insured life in the contract, then upon their passing the beneficiary will need to file a claim with the insurance company.  The variable annuity contract would then terminate after paying the death benefit but the insurance company could offer them various payout options.    The death benefit should not be less than the account balance of the variable annuity.  Also, a death benefit from a variable annuity is not tax free.      Best advice is to read the variable annuity contract and then have the beneficiary give the insurance company or the salesperson a call.

If you have matching in your 401(K) (Roth 401k), try to invest up to that match.  Then place $ in a Roth IRA.  401K or IRA are tax deferred rather than tax free (you pay the taxes when you withdraw when very likely at much higher with 35plus year time frame).  Roth IRA is highly advisable because all principal and earnings can be taken out tax free (after 59 1/2 year old and in Roth for at least five years, there are a few exceptions).  So unless the income tax drops or is eliminated when you withdraw, a Roth Investment is recommended.  (with this massive bailout raiding future taxpayers, income taxes not likely to go down a great deal in the next 1/2 century).   As to what to invest in,  a Roth IRA is ONLY a retirement plan.

Q6ig8k7Xaa	I manage several apartment buildings in Seattle.    What we care about:    Will you pay your rent on time?  Will you destroy the apartment?  Will you piss off the neighbors?    As mentioned earlier, many managers do not run criminal background checks, just credit checks.    I am one of these people.     Read the application closely, if it says "have you been charged with a felony?" you can safely say no. If it says "have you been convicted of a crime?" then you have a choice to make.    One way to find out what kind of background check they are going to do, without seeming too suspicious, is to ask if they charge an application fee. If they say yes, then ask them what your money is going towards.    My advice is this, don't disclose too much information if you don't have to, but don't get caught in a lie.    I rented a place to a convicted felon, who was very upfront about it. He was a great tenant.    The other piece of advice, which is more general to renting an apartment, is that you have negotiating power. This will depend on the local rental market, but the thing we fear the most is vacancies.    If, and only if, they have a problem, which I doubt they will, offer to sign a longer lease, or pay a few months in advance.    Your main worry should be your credit, and work references.     Oh and I have a 1 bedroom available up here in Seattle -- I don't run background checks.|`|PxoKseAiaa	I think the applications only ask if you have been convicted of a *felony* not misdemeanors.

Then, you might need to be honest, and it could cause you problems.|`|tvUAO4ioaa	Most landlords in my area do a credit check, not a criminal background check - but some do both. They have to get permission to do one, so if the landlord brings out the paperwork for a criminal background check, give full disclosure.

oiOtOD0Taa	Depends why they want to return it.    If buyers remorse, you don't have to, or you can but get them to pay return shipping & just refund basic cost of what they paid without shipping.    If it's flawed or damaged beyond the photos/description, then you can repair, replace or refund. And you should, IMO because they paid a price based on what you told them they would be getting & they didn't get it.     My ebay mantra:   Describe an item like there are no photos.  Photograph like there is no description.    Then you are covered if they happened to not read that their was a stain or a scratch etc etc. It's all clear and they know up front.    P.S. There is a difference between having no return policy at all and a policy of No Returns.|`|6DQSkKgWaa	This happened to me too.  I decided to return the money to the buyer (minus the shipping fees) even though it was the buyer's fault for not reading the listing and looking at the pictures.      As it turned out, she was so grateful she gave me a glowing feedback.      I think it depends on how many things you have sold and how high your rating is.  If you have sold a great many things and the buyer's bad feedback won't make much difference to you, then stick to your guns.  But...if it will affect your rating, it's better to refund the buyer's money after you get the item back.  It isn't fair, but it may be better for you in the long run.  If you decide not to give in, I think you will have a chance to respond to the feedback.    Also, in the future, you may choose only to sell to people with good feedback of their own.  This will help weed out the unfair customers.    Back in the days when I was being trained in business, I was taught that the customer is always right.  In the end, if you go above and beyond to please the customer, it will serve you well.      Good luck to you!|`|7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	If it said right in your listing that you do not take returns then do not take it back. But if you did not specify if you take returns or not then you should take it back. Just my opinion. You still run the risk of getting a bad rating if you do not take it back no matter what.|`|s4iVl04raa	If on the auction you selected that you don't except returns, than you have no obligation to refund him the money. I would stick to your policy! Some people just think that they can be pushy enough and get away with not following the rules. I have had a lot of problems with buyers on ebay, I don't sell on that website anymore.|`|bj6HrGtLaa	Well, if you really need the money now, then you do NOT have to buy your item back because of your return policy, but.....think about it. If you get a bad rating, it truly does make future buyers in your items think that you may scam them if you have a bad rating. I would give it back and just try to sell it again, GOOD LUCK.

l1VZkkOSaa	The fixed costs stay the same, i.e. $ 16,000.    Variable costs are expected to be ($18,000 / 12,000) = $1.50 per unit.  So at an activity level of 16,000 units, variable costs are expected to be $ 24,000    Sales revenue per unit is expected to be the same.   The sales revenue per unit is ($48,000 per unit / 12,000 units) = $4 per unit.   So at an activity level of 16,000 units, revenue is expected to be $ 64,000    Expected operating income at an activity level of 16,000 units is:  $ 64,000 - $ 16,000 - $ 24,000 = $ 24,000

Qqz0H2hEaa	1  Check with a loan officer.  Depending on a lot of variables, but a huge number of first time home buyers would be better off getting an FHA mortgage and it only requires 3.5% down.  You could get the low interest rates that are available now and the low prices that are available now and also qualify for this tax credit.    Under current law you do have to pay that $7500 tax credit back at $500 per year.  It is essentially a 15 year interest free loan.|`|FQRjfbW6aa	There is a new plan being brought up to Congress but it has not been voted on yet.  It is different than the current plan though.

NwkZ5OmCaa	This is a refi.  Refis are different than if this was the original loan.    Here's an explanation that explains the difference of "acquisition debt"    PMI refinancing rules   PMI on loans refinanced in 2007 might be deductible, but only up to the property's acquisition loan amount.     For example, you bought a house five years ago for $150,000 using an 80-20 piggyback loan arrangement of $120,000 and $15,000. Your home acquisition amount is $135,000.     In 2007, you refinanced the property, taking out a $140,000 loan that included a PMI policy. You can only deduct the PMI premiums for the loan amount up to $135,000, the amount of the mortgage when you acquired the home, not on the full new loan of $140,000.|`|cEmYFqITaa	Maybe You should try to google it first ,nonetheless, if you prefer some direct resource ,here http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...  might be helpful.

As a month to month the contracts end and begin on the first, so your notice went into effect Oct 1, with 60 days ending Dec 1 (they do not count exact days).

Expect to pay over $1000 a month for a tiny efficiency apartment.  If you want to buy, expect to pay about  $500K plus for an average home.  We rent an average 3 bedroom home and our rent is $2500 a month.  This is very ordinary.    Electricity is very expensive.  The good news is the climate is moderate.  Winter time is in the 70s.. summer mid 80s.  If you live on the leeward side, it gets hotter so you'll use your air conditioner.  If you use it alot expect to pay $300 month or more.      We just use our fans and we're fine.    Food...very expensive.  Especiallly things that need to be shipped in from the mainland like milk.  Just shop wisely    So if you're frugal, have a job and have a roommate or spouse that has a decent paying job, you'll be ok.    We love it here.  It's worth it!!
r59SRbKIaa	Two answers.    The first is no.    The second is if this DID increase page rank, it would be an artificial inflation and the search engines would very quickly figure out how to detect it and ban you from their indices.    I'll give you an example. How many forums have you been to where the owners whine "This site is supported by adSense, do your part and click our ads!"    If you have, they won't be asking for very long or won't have adSense on their site for very long. This is strictly forbidden and Google has their ways of detecting it.    Page indexing and page rank are two different things. Page indexing is determined by the page's CONTENT - is it the most relevant document for the entered keywords?    Page indexing is affected by page RANK, but not inversely. Page rank is nowhere near as important as it used to be. It is determined by the number of pages linking **TO** your site. This affects the site's "popularity," so this factor also increases the indexing of the page in the results.    Corollary to the above, you might think you can set up 100 web sites and have them all link to your target site. Two things to consider: 1) search engines are already wise to this. This is called a "link network" and will indeed give you excellent short term results - until you're found out. Poof. 2) All those sites that "guarantee top ten search engine positioning?" This is what they do. It shows results just long enough to cash the check . . . then . . . poof . . . .    Also you see tons of traffic, but no sales or conversions. Why? Because it's junk traffic. Don't waste your time trying to game the engines. They, and their programmers, are much smarter than any of us. Concentrate on quality content and solving visitor problems and it will come to you.|`|LUoZC3ycaa	It would have no effect what so ever in the organic listings.

TwqIpHJLaa	V. B. is mistaken about "make less money."    While the AMT was INTENDED to strike super-wealthy taxpayers, its often called the stealth tax because it sneaks up on so many unsuspecting people.  Indeed, it is by far one of the most dreaded provisions in the tax code.  You're likely to confront the AMT, for example, if you make $100,000 or more a year -- or if you make $75,000 and write off such mundane things as state taxes and interest on a home-equity loan.  The AMT isn't about how much you earn, really; it's about making sure that no one has so many deductions and credits he doesn't pay some tax.    The larger problem is personal and dependent exemptions, the standard deduction, state and local taxes, and miscellaneous itemized deductions.  In fact, the IRS estimated that in 2007, nearly 95 percent of AMT revenues was attributable to these fairly common deductions.    The characteristics most likely to give rise to AMT liability for "ordinary" taxpayers who do not operate businesses are:    A large number of personal exemptions   A large amount of state and local taxes paid   A large amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions   A large amount of deductible medical expenses   The bargain element of incentive stock options   A large amount of capital gains     Hope this helps!|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Make less money.    Don't have the kind of tax return that has different numbers on the AMT form than on the 1040 (private activity bond interest, too many kids, too many unreimbursed business expenses, move to a lower tax state, don't exercise ISOs and then not sell the stock), etc.    I stand by my "make less money" issue.  I was being sarcastic.  AMT is there.  You hit it, you hit it.  I've seen someone who made $40K pay it because they filed MFS  and had owed nothing on the 1040 because they had a bund of kids, but owed on the AMT form because you can't claim dependents and the exemption is $35K  for MFS.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Don't itemize deductions. That is what triggers the AMT.  They are looking ( in the original spirit of the rule) for people who make $1Million but "write-off" $1Million and pay nothing.

Second look into what field your business is based that will determine where to look for grants. Startup funds are the hardest to acquire. There are many avenues to acquire finances. (bank loan - angel investor).  Usually governments will not finance your business without some other source of seed funding, which you should also look into.  My best bet would be to source all the local grants in your area, apply for as many as you are eligible. If your really serious seek a financial business advisory team or mentor to help with your startup.  Best of luck.

You could put your money in an online brokerage account and buy an exchange-traded fund, or "ETF" (similar to a mutual fund, but no significant fees).  Some to consider are DIA (called "diamonds"), SPY (called "spyders"), and QQQQ. ETF's are designed to mirror the underlying indexes, so if you buy a share of DIA, you are buying a share of a fund that owns the same stocks as the Dow Jones Industrial Adverage, the SPY is the same for the S&P 500, and the QQQQ for the Nasdaq Composite.

aKDPrPlkaa	hum...  Individual or entity?    Loans are not deductible per se.  Depending on the type of loan, the interest you pay on the loan may be deductible.      Aside from home mortgages and student loans, there are very few interest deductions individuals can declare.      Companies (corporations, etc.) is a whole different game.  They have better chances to deduct interest as business expense.  One trick they used to do, but can't do anymore was leasing.    In the past, corporations tried to also expense the payments of the loans (that would be Payment + Interest), as to reduce income and pay less taxes, via a "lease".  The lease payment was all an expense!  Furthermore, the business would not show that it is heavily indebted in the balance sheet.  But new accounting practices (and I believe the IRS) no longer allow this.  If the item purchased will last for a very long time (over a year), the the lease would get treated as a long term liability (as a loan!).  I am not sure payments are treated as  current expenses (I think they do) or if it is considered a loan (so, only interest is deducted, but then you can depreciate the asset).    Hope this helps.|`|AA11284831	Only if it's a business loan or the proceeds of the loan were used to purchase investment property.

857613b00f17e9b24da4c2f617b245d5aa	Know everything about cars = automotive engineer/mechanical engineer. Pay (I think, not really sure) probably starts at $60k. Considering that the auto companies (Ford/Chrysler/GM) are depending on a government bail out right now I'm not sure if going that route is a good idea.

BUT, they can't be the sort of person who faints/gets nauseated at the sight of blood.
AA10469473	Either one of you, but not both, can claim the baby.  You'd have to figure it both ways to see who gets more from claiming the baby. It isn't always the higher income that gets the most.    And predator is totally wrong on his advice to file a joint return, and on his understanding of common law marriage which most states don't even have any more, and even those that do require more than just living together.    And every other answer you have here so far is wrong too.|`|3r2Dp4Dkaa	Since your income is higher you should take the child. Since you are not married, you can also file Head of Household. He will just file single.|`|deef86f1312d6aa410da26db3ce34134aa	Since your income is higher you provided most of the support and are entitled to the dependent.  This is better too since your tax bracket may be higher than his.|`|JsDID6gJaa	Even though you not married, you can file jointly and in effect be married, be it common law.    Other wise if filing separately only one can claim the baby.    I'd suggest who ever is in the higher tax bracket, and in this case yours... to maximize your tax returns.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	There is an argument similar to this going in a great many households.  Many people claim they consider themselves married and don't need a piece of paper.  That's all fine and dandy, but when it comes to tax time, the government sees it differently.  There is no filing status for "living together with dependents."      You were not married on December 31, you have a child, and for the fun of it let's assume that you paid more than half of the household expenses purely because you make more.  That would qualify you to file Head of Household and claim the baby.  But what about his claim?  He hasn't got one.  It's his baby, but since this is a divorce or living apart thing where there is a custody declaration or arrangement (that I know of), he has no claim to the baby as a deduction for him.  He would have to file as single.    It doesn't have anything to do with who makes more money, it's a matter of who the custodial parent is.  Of course, you shouldn't take the word of some stranger posting online.  You should consult a tax professional.

Gun3UGzaaa	Sorry - Your credit score is great, but $40,000 a year of net income is too low to support a $250,000 mortgage payment.  The principal and interest on that amount is $1400 a month.  When you add on property taxes and insurance, the payment is too high.<br>  <br>  I would look for a loan of around $100,000 maximum.  You have a chance of getting that.<br>  <br>  Bankrate.com has good loan calculators to use.|`|AA11173563	never seen a 850 score ever in 13 years in the mortgage industry. $40k a year is only $3333.33 monthly  and you r max housing allowance including taxes and insurance is about $966. So when you take off monthly taxes and insurance rates for your area then you get down to net principal and interest.  So lets say $650 is that number then at 5% the max loan will be $121,000 there abouts so your answer is no you will not qualify at all for that size loan. Now you can add certain things back into the income and get more house like 1/2 of self employment tax as well as depreciation but I doubt that will ever get you close enough for this loan|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Sorry, but your income wont qualify you for a 250,000 loan. Your credit score is great and being self employed isn't a problem with some lenders, but your income just isn't enough to make a quarter million dollar loan affordable. I make almost $30k more than you do per year and I'm struggling to make the payments on a 40 year fixed rate loan of $250,000. <br>  <br>  I suggest you continue to rent the cheapest thing you can stand to live in. Build up an emergency fund, pay off all your other debts, save up a big down payment and then reconsider. In the meantime go crazy with your business and try to earn more money to accelerate the process.|`|KN3I89Ycaa	So you are getting $40,000 a year in income?  $250k will be a little high on a regular mortgage.  Your FICO score is 850?  That is perfect and hard to achieve, so if it's true, your credit will qualify you for the lowest rates, but your income dictates the loan amount.  And if you have other debts, it will pull it down even more.  I'd say on a traditional 30 year, you can get pretty close to that and a down payment could get you there.  Loans are harder these days, especially being self-employed, so I would shop around and I wish you luck!|`|ePkiOzPSaa	If you mean net as in after taxes, you might be able to do that, as long as all of this is being recorded properly on your taxes.  If your scores are really 850, then the next thing will be to saving up a nice down payment, which is an important thing to have in this economic climate.  If this is your first home buy (or you haven't owned a home in ~3 yrs), you may be able to take advantage of programs with lower downpayments, as little as 3%.  With your score that high, you may even have a shot at getting a loan for the house and a loan for the downpayment, though I wouldn't suggest that.|`|AA12291184	you have an 850? <br>  <br>  wow, that is like the top 1%|`|briRpzL1aa	That will not happen with traditionally lending because you will not have enough assets...

You should call your mortgage banker/broker and see how things are going, when you can be expected to be pre-approved and if there are additional documents needed by the underwriter.<br>  <br>  This will keep you abreast of things and let the mortgage banker.broker know that you are interested in the mortgage you are applying for.<br>  <br>  Underwriting should take about 48-72 hours depending on the item requested by the underwriter and what level that document need to be approved at.<br>  <br>  Your mortgage consultant should be more proactive by making a call to you at least once a week or so, just to keep you up to date on the process of your mortgage, even if it is just to say hi things are going great so far.

4dntstR9aa	Sorry for your situation.  You are not alone in this situation.  The Bank will eventually come and get the car.  The problem is they have thousands of cars to pick up and probably are real limited on Recovery companies to pick them up.  Them telling you that is was supposed to "picked up" in a few days is blowing smoke, as a scare tactic to you.  Once they get to you and your loan, the car will be picked up.  Here's the problem.  Even though it will be repossessed, you are still responsible for a balance on the car.  When they pick it up, 99% of the time it will go to auction.  Once it sells it at auction (for usually wholesale price to another dealers) you will most likely be held accountable for the difference.  You signed a loan/contract stating you would.  It's in the fine print.  This is a horrendous economy that we are in and you are not alone, but this is generally what happens.  The Auctions are PACKED with Repo's right now - Motorhomes, Trailers, RV's, Quads, and every kind of car imaginable.  They are selling a bit over wholesale right now, but the end result is the same.  You will be responsible for the difference of what is paid at auction and the balance on your car loan.  I wish you luck.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Yes, you have to keep it insured as long as it is registered as your vehicle. And of course you can not leave it on the street when the registration expires. <br>  <br>  You have to make arrangements to return the vehicle to the place the bank specifies, and have them take ownership of it at that location. They do not have to come and get it.|`|AA10472839	Call the bank again.  They're human beings.... they may be overwhelmed with work or maybe they dropped the ball.<br>  <br>  I congratulate you.

I would not worry about it since you will have to repay the difference between what you owe and what they sold it for at auction plus fees.|`|kifwyOgKaa	You do realize you will still be responsible for paying the money that is still owed on the vehicle when the repossess it right?<br>  <br>  They will sell the car at auction, and whatever the difference is from what you owed and what they sell the car for, you will still have to pay.  <br>  <br>  As for the insurance and registration, I would suggest keeping both until the car is repossessed, otherwise if the car is hit by someone, you will be held responsible for the damages.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	with the state of things at the mo people aren't wanting to buy cars so the last thing they want is to take the car back!

They want you to pay. That being said, there are legal documents they must file in order to repo your car. It is not as simple as you imply. Then, they have to schedule the repo. They are a bank, so they probably subcontract this task and that may take time. Keep it in the driveway and make it easy, that is all you can do at this point.
oUXhcD66aa	I work at Jackson Hewitt and I can tell you that I have had more customers come to my office with things that H&R block messed up on for us to fix this year than any other year I have worked there. I have been there for 6 years and I love it. We have a gold guarantee that covers you up to 5000 dollars. If something goes wrong or there is a mistake than it can be fixed. The one i work at also offers a discount health benefits program which is great! I have it myself. I know I cant make up your mind, but give Jackson Hewitt a try!!|`|ZejOcCgDaa	I myself just came from Jackson Hewitt, I have been going to JH for 11 yrs now.   When I walked in I did end up with a new person, she didn't know much so I just turned and asked the man in charge a question and he came right over.  Stayed and watched what she was doing and he finally sat and took over.  So yes it depends on who you get when you go to JH.   I had income taxes and reality taxes done and they charged me $438. and that is just for doing them I am not getting them back the fast way, if I decided to have the money back in a day or two (RAL) it would have cost me and extra $200. or more.   I would try Turbo Tax on-line if you are good with numbers, me I was just afraid I would screw something up that's why I go to Jackson Hewitt.  Good luck|`|KxxkOPeTaa	TonWon -    It all depends on what type of service you are looking to receive.  If you are good with numbers and navigating the IRS forms, then you can try one of the tax software packages.  But some people just don't like to even think of numbers so one of the chains (JH or HR, etc) could help you out.  Depending on how complicated your return is, you could be charged $100 or more and people usually say the service is hit-or-miss.  You may get a really good tax professional who has been working there for years or you may get someone who just took one of their "quick study" courses and is doing taxes to earn a few bucks.  Either way, the company will stand by the return.    You can also hire a CPA - CPA's are probably the most knowledgable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.    You are technically no more or less likely to be audited depending on who you go to (the IRS doesn't really look at who prepared your return for audit selection) although you are more likely to make a mistake using software than a JH / HR representative is and they are more likely to make a mistake than a CPA.    For tax preparation help, you could try the site below...I found it very helpful and they are extremely fast and friendly. They are CPA's but I think they moonlight and prepare taxes so they have "day jobs"...it's not like they are doing it for the money. They're just trying to help people out. Also, their rate can't be beat...last year, I paid something like $50 and they prepared my return for me and got me the refund fast. I didn't even have to do too much work...just sent them the forms I received in the mail (W-2, etc.) and I was done!|`|88Y3PJQvaa	Turbo tax baby.  You don't have to pay someone to do your taxes.  They have audit support and they have a phone number if you get stuck and need help they have people that can help you.  Not to mention they walk you through step by step it is really simple.
UA8USXFNaa	I don't know about your specific course but, if it's law & anthropology joint hons it may already be a qualifying law degree. Call the uni and ask if it isn't specified on the prospectus. Joint hons with law and a language are quite common and are qualifying degrees, and there are also some other more unusual joint hons such as law with chemistry which are also qualifying. These are also not LLB degrees; the actual letters (BA, LLB etc) have no bearing on whether the degree you study is a qualifying law degree or not, it just depends whether you get to study all the core law modules and whether it is recognised by the law society as qualifying. Call or email the university department to make sure. If it isn't a qualifying degree, you just do the GDL (sometimes also called the CPE) after your first degree; it's a one year conversion course. That's what I'm doing! I have no idea about barristers but the good law firms tend to recruit between 40-50% of their trainee solicitors from non-law students, so you aren't at a disadvantage if you study something else first. Plus the vast majority of law firms pay your GDL fees and give you a grant for living costs if you have secured a training contract with them (they recruit 2 years in advance), so the extra year of study needn't cause problems financially. Good luck!|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	No you do not need an LLB you could get another degree and then do a graduate diploma in law (1 year full time) Other options is to become a legal executive however they do not tend to be as highly regarded as those who follow the traditional routes to become a solicitor or a barrister.<br>  <br>  check out these sites for more info<br>  <a href="http://www.college-of-law.co.uk/a-career-in-law/routes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.college-of-law.co.uk/a-career...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ilex.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ilex.org.uk/</a>|`|bhNaTYjOaa	It's a very crowded and competitive profession especially for barristers. <br>  To progress I think you will agree that of it came to a choice between someone with an LLB and someone who'd read 'Law for dummies' there would be no contest.

If you don't submit it, then you don't get a refund.|`|AA10469473	If you have a refund coming, you have to file a tax return to get it.  Otherwise you just donate your refund to that uncle you obviously love so well, your Uncle Sam.    Maybe you need to do a little more reading.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	how can you get a refund if you don't pay anything in the first place?  you may say you know the law, but you also say you are trying to get money from the government without paying taxes.  that's not how it works, whether you can read or not.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	There is no alternative way.  Even if you did sue, you would lose, because the government is not required to issue refunds to anyone who does not file, so there is nothing for which to sue them.  The money is theirs, not yours, unless you file.    If your truly do not owe them anything, you can file a return that says that you do not owe them anything.  Filing a return that says that you do not owe them anything is the ONLY way to obtain a refund without filing a return that says that you owe them something.|`|WgT5l14baa	Your definition of "idiot" seems to be someone who doesn't agree with your preconceived erroneous ideas.    I followed your link.  Irwin Schiff is a long time fraud.  The reason he is prohibited from selling his book is not that it contains some "secrets" that the government doesn't want you to know about and is trying to suppress, as Schiff would have you believe, but that it contains a huge nimber of errors, which, if the advice were followed, would get the citizen fined for filing a frivolous return.    Another link on his site refers to his appearance at the Toledo School of Law, giving the impression that he is a recognized expert.  Actually, he was booked by the University of Toledo Campus Activities Board for entertainment.  One of the rooms reserved for the occation was the lounge in the law school.  Being brought in by a student organization is quite different from being brought in by the law school faculty as a guest lecturer and recognized expert, which is what Schiff would like you to believe.    Another of his postings is his tax return filled in with zeros and the claim that this is a valid return.  Schiff cites case law to back up the claim.  This is the only part that is accurate.  But it is incomplete.  It is true that the court ruled that the IRS can't prosecute you for failure to file if you file a return with zeros on it, but Schiff does not mention that you can be charged with filing a false return.  The court did not say that a zero return is legal, as Schiff would have you believe, but that the IRS made a mistake and charged the wrong crime.    Schiff says nothing new.  Most of these arguements have been around for decades.  The specific legal answer to your question about whether you can get a refund without filing a return was settled a long time ago in Holker v. United States, 737 F.2d 751, 752-53 (8th Cir. 1984)|`|161de69a9833dd88dea520e119827c7caa	Step 1: Hire a lawyer who actually understands how to read law.|`|kyL7UNeRaa	you paid that money to the government so how do you think you can get it back without going through the government and being subjected to their laws?      if you don't like our government do something about it or move somewhere where they have a "trusting government"|`|U4ABDwKPaa	The only reason people get a tax refund is because during the year, your employer deducts taxes before paying you, your "net" pay.  The refund happens when you go through the trouble of filing, which means you tell the goverment all about your deductions and expenses.  Thats when the govt spits out a refund, because in retrospect your children/pension contributions/whatever (??) entitle you to pay less income tax on your year's salary.    If you don't file, the govt won't know how much you earned and how many deductions to account for, so no refund.    You have to give them the whole picture for them to realize you overpaid your taxes during the year.|`|oHUDTX7aaa	No, you can't get any overpayment of taxes (or refundable credits) without filing an income tax return. And if you don't file within 3 years, you lose any refund that was due you.     I used to answer phones as an IRS collection representative. Every now and then I'd get a caller like you and I'd have to bite my tongue to avoid getting into a fruitless argument.|`|697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	No, you can not get a refund for any tax WITHHELD from your pay without filing.    You are the one that is ignorant of the law.  The law requires all individuals to pay a tax on their income.  Wages you receive in exchange for your labor is income.  It is not voluntary.  The voluntary nature is due to the fact the government relies on people to provide an assessment of their taxes.  Payment of the taxes or the withholding of those taxes from your pay is NOT voluntary.    I see from your link that you are a follower of Irwin Schiff.  Do you know that NONE of Irwin Schiff's arguments have ever prevailed in court?  Do you know that Irwin Schiff is currently serving a prison sentence for violating the income tax laws?  Do you know that the argument that income taxes are voluntary has NEVER won in court?  You do now.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  If you continue down this path, you will eventually find that the IRS will levy your bank accounts and garnish your wages if the income taxes withheld from your pay do not cover what you are supposed to pay in income taxes.  You can possibly even be criminally charged.  Also, the argument that income tax is voluntary is considered a frivolous argument and the IRS has the authority and legal right to assess a penalty of $5,000 for every year in which you make that argument.  Again, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.    Here is what the court said in just ONE of the Schiff cases.  http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2...  "he claims to believe that income taxes are voluntary in the sense that one does not have to pay them unless one wants to. To the extent that income taxes are said to be "voluntary," however, they are only voluntary in that one files the returns and pays the taxes without the IRS first telling each individual the amount due and then forcing payment of that amount. The payment of income taxes is not optional, however, see, e.g., Wilcox v. Commissioner, 848 F.2d 1007, 1008 (9th Cir.1988); Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460, 467 (8th Cir.1985), and the average citizen knows that the payment of income taxes is legally required."    Do you really want to follow that bozo?|`|HJT3KIPOaa	You're asking how to defraud the US government. That is a felony punishable by up to 3 years in prison or $250,000 fine, or both.    Attempt to evade or defeat tax is also a felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison or $100,000 fine. A felony conviction means loss of voting rights, gun ownership rights, difficulty finding employment, etc.    "I read something on the internet" will not work when you're in front of a judge. The courts decide whether you go to prison, not Joe Blow on the internet.    Payment of income tax is not "voluntary." There's a long line of court rulings saying so (check the links) and none saying otherwise. Most people voluntarily calculate and pay their tax, but if you do not, the IRS will calculate your tax and take it from you with penalties and interest.    If you only wanted self-affirming answers, you shouldn't have bothered asking in the first place.
OacSIfSiaa	Chances are you re-set the statute of limitations in your state when you agreed to a payment plan, this means that they now have the legal right to seek legal action to collect.    Check your state statutes at this web site to see how long they had to seek legal action.  '  http://www.statuteoflimitations.net/debt...    If this debt was time barred, then they could not take you to court.  Also check to verify the summons authenticity.  It should list the court date, location, and the docket number.  Call the court to see if it is legitimate.  If it is not a legitimate court summons, then you could sue under the FDCPA.    The only way to keep it off your credit report is to get a written agreement that if you pay it off in full, they will not report it to the CRA's    If it goes to court and they win a judgment, then it will remain on your report for 7 years if you pay it off, and could remain longer if you do not pay as the CRA's report it by their guidlines or your states statutes which ever is longer.

6UEhNTGiaa	A well designed medical program will require you to sign up for Medicare after you turn 65.  They will offset the amount they pay to reflect the expected Medicare reimbursement.    For example, suppose you file a claim for a medical service for $1,000 and you plan covers 80% of expenses but Medicare pays $400 for that procedure.  Many plans will say your claim is for $1,000 - $400 (ie assume you have Medicare coverage) and then pay 80% of the remainder (in this case, they reimburse 80% of $600, or $480)     Without Medicare you'd pay $520 ($1,000 - $480).  With Medicare, you'd pay $120 ($1,000 - $480 -$400).    Check the plan and see how it integrates with Medicare before deciding.

AA10236380	You're really talking about two different businesses: dog treats and clothing.    For each of them, the first step is to define and research your customer.  Who are they?  Age, gender, income, education, geographic location, lifestyle, etc.  You need this information to refine how you design your product, set a price, handle logistics and advertising.    Next, you need to know your competitors: will your dog treats be aimed at people who might otherwise be looking at mainstream alternatives like Bacon Bits or Snausages, or people who'd be looking at other "designer" treats?  Where do your competitors sell their products?  At what price?  Where/how do they advertise?    Based on all of this, you can fine-tune your product.  Is having an "organic, all-natural" treat going to be a big deal for your customers?  Should it be suitble for big and/or very small dogs?  Etc.    You'll need to set your price so that it's competitive with other products and covers your expenses.    If you're selling online, you'll still need to determine where you'll focus your sales efforts, since you'll need to advertise your web site & products in those areas, and you'll want to manufacture your products at the most logical location to keep transportation costs down.    Lastly, promotion: Print advertising?  Radio?  Sponsorship of speical events like dog shows?  How can you reach the greatest number of customers at the least cost?    And of course you'll need to deal with how you'll accept payment, how you'll handle any legal concerns governing selling pet food, where you'll get start-up capital for the business and a line of credit for purchasing raw materials, etc.    Bottom line:  1.  Write up a business plan that addresses all of this.  You can find a template for one at my web site, www.keeterconsulting.com.  2.  Start as small and simply as you can: target a single product at a tightly defined market, then grow the business off the profits from that initial launch.|`|sKe3cBPpaa	I'd stick to just the clothing end of it.

AA10286336	OK....I have to answer this one because I went to school to become a Medical Assistant. Yes, this is a real career. Yes, there are jobs in this field. However, do your homework about the schools you are thinking of going to because some schools credits don't transfer to other colleges or univerisities if you should decide to further your education. I made that mistake, so I warn people ahead of time. I decided after working 2 years as a medical assistant in a Dr office that I wanted to move forward and become an RN, but my credits that I earned from the Medical Assisting School I chose did not count towards my college credits at my local Community College. Anyway, there are a lot of Dr offices that use MA's rather then LPN's these days so they don't have to pay as much. Depending on your area, MA's start around $11 an hour, where as LPN's usually go for about twice that. When I was working from 2003-2005, I made $11 an  hour to start, then $12 after a year. But, medical is in high demand if you're willing to take the time to go for it. MA's are a way to get your foot in the door and while you work as an MA, you can keep going to school to become an RN because thats where the real money and demand are! Good Luck with whatever you choose to do!!|`|xBd96wvRaa	I am certified medical assistant. I ditched it after a couple years.

In the meantime, yes, you should go back to school and get that bachelors degree and im sure, if what you study has any merit (busines, accounting, finance, engineering, etc.) you will be fine.

I am currently on my last semester of an Accounting degree and I got hired last fall by a very good firm starting a year after my offer.  I would recommend accounting, health care, IT, or a similar high growth career field if you want a very good chance of getting a job when you are through.

I have about 60 variations on my resume, including many that do not include my education and awards. At least you are getting interviews - this is a good sign and will eventually turn into a firm job offer for you.    You don't mention what your AAS is in - the best places to advance with just an AAS are usually something like doing taxes and bookkeeping / accounting type jobs, and law enforcement. My sister, who did not even finish her AA, is a very highly thought of member of the local government. She had always liked computers, and is known as the computer guru for a large city, despite not taking any classes in the subject area. As long as you aren't working, try to figure out what you do like to do, and try to get into a job doing it.

Its not a good time to be thinking about moving from a job, especially if you dont have a lot of experience.

Holidays obviously are different as you have to build them up.    If that was me and I was getting married and planning a family, I would stay put and save up for the wedding.

m9gZ50s5aa	Call your mortgage company and ask them if they would be willing to doing a short sale. If they agree (which they probably will as many are in your situation), this means they are willing to accept a predetermined amount lower than what you owe. If you can prove to them that the house is only worth 127k and they are willing to accept that amount you could sell the home and walk away. It's definitely worth a phone call.|`|r67YzIv5aa	First of all, it may depend on the state you live in or your lender, but, even people up to date on their payments can do a short sale.  Be sure this is what you want to do.      Second, do you love your home, want to keep it?  If the payment is too high call and ask them to do a loan modification, it will lower your interest rate to a more affordable payment.        Third, if neither of these apply to you, sorry.  Sticking it out until the market has an upswing is probably your only option.  If you don't plan on moving for the next 3-5 years stick it out.  Your home value will go up.|`|AA12276356	Contrary to what the poster above said, as long as you are current on your mortgage payments, a lender will not grant you a "short sale". Those are only used in extreme hardship cases such as people who are in forclosure and cannot afford to make the payments.    Unfortunately, you're going to have to stick it out until property values increase, which they will eventually. Or, see if you can refinance into a lower interest rate.

I was told if something is coming off your credit within a year. Leave it alone. But if it takes longer to come off, then pay it off, in payments if you have too. But make sure you keep your receipts!! And keep them longer than 7 seven years as they can turn around and say you never paid them. ( That happened to me. Good thing I kept my receipt).

I2yzUID0aa	I don't know why billing and coding are so often grouped together like its one job. They are two completely different things. Hospitals have a billing department, and they have a health information management department which is where the coders work.  Maybe at some facilities they are more closely linked but I work in a physicians office and as a coder I am part of HIM, and billers are part of Finance.     Anyway, I have my associates in HIM and have been doing coding for almost 3 years and I love it. Unfortunately with the economy the way it is, this field is taking a hit like many others. I recommend going to the websites for your local hospitals and searching the open positions they have to see if there are jobs available. That will be a good indicator of the outlook in your area. I live in NY and we are facing MAJOR cuts to all hospitals this year, which is forcing lay offs by all area hospitals (some coders lost their jobs) as well as freezes on hiring.|`|3mAgM405aa	Most medical billing/coding training offered online are from non-certified training institutions.  And of course, they want to promote at-home medical coding/billing which is not possible here in the U.S. due to patient confidentiality since the majority of medical records are not allowed off-site from their medical recordkeepers.    If you happen to take a certified training course at a brick and mortar institution, then you are properly certified.  However, finding an in-house medical coding/billing job is another matter which in the end, you will have to decide whether ot not it's worth all the time and effort to acquire a medical billing certificate initially.

joZFuLEwaa	I am a Realtor.  You are doing the right thing by shopping around.  But what you should have done in the beginning is take both good faith estimates from each bank and compare them.  Then you should have chosen the one with the best rate and the best deal.      I wouldn't have stopped there.  I would have called the other bank to see if they could beat the first banks deal.  I am almost 100% sure that the second bank would have beat the first banks deal.      Now that you are in it kinda over your head this is what you should do.  Choose the best deal for you.  Do not continue with both as you will probably be liable for both appraisals.  In CT appraisals are paid for up front.  So I am not sure if that is what they are going to have you do.  The obvious and smart thing to do right now is to chose the best deal and go with it.  Inform the other bank that you are withdrawing your application.

Have also looked on www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates, and can't find anything about restrictions on the personal tax allowance where people earn enough to go into Higher Rate. I'm sure something was mentioned about it in the speech made when the extra increase was announced for the low-paid affected by the abolition on the 10% band. Unfortunately tax office is now closed, but will see if I can find out more before question closed.  NB: Have had another look, and I think the matter is addressed by the Higher Tax limit being lowered in tax rates.

fECovy3Laa	The check is simply counterfeit or a forgery.  You cash it, send them the money and in about 3 or 4 months your bank takes the money from the check back out of your account.  You're out the money plus bank charges.    What grant did you apply for?  It's extremely difficult for a private citizen to get a government grant.  If someone contacted you and told you that you could get a grant and wanted to do it for you for a fee, you lost that money as well.  Even if it was legitimate, no grant is guaranteed until it's awarded.  Any application is a request and could as easily be turned down as accepted.|`|AA10305589	Sounds like a variation on the tried and true counterfeit check scam.  It works the same as for all those fake lotteries you have probably 'won' as well.    Bottom line - the check is fake.  Counterfeit checks can be so good these days it is impossible even for the banks to tell.      If you deposit the check, then withdraw and send them the funds.  then the bank finds within a few weeks that the check is no good, and they come after you for the money.  And you are legally responsible to pay them back.  Since you already sent the funds to them, you will have to reimburse the bank 'out of pocket'.  If you didn't send the funds, the bank will collect the money from your account.  But you could still be in trouble for depositing a false check.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	How to Sell on eBay    Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.    Instructions:    Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.    Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred".     -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy?     Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready.     Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top.     Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item.     Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great.     Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay.     Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person.     *Tips*    -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay.     -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.    -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.    -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly.     -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell!     -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping.     -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.    -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller!     -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid.     -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for.     -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings. Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more. So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.    -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it.     -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reason|`|c205d2af3c68e3ac29f18413bf92ebcbaa	It all depends, your starting bid may be too high for the items. Another thing that you could do is to put a "Buy it now" price which always helps. :)

S1IPVvawaa	Try a local newspaper or t-shirt place. With no training or experience, it will be a grunt position, and the pay will not be too great, but they will train you, and you will get some experience. You will probably just get things no one else wants to do- like non-creative stuff that is tedious or requires a lot of typing, but at least you will learn how to work the software. Also, you could always get your own software and teach yourself. You could do things like invitations for family and friends, and once you get better, go to smaller locally-owned businesses and offer your services for flyers, business cards, etc. Last thing- about your current job- is it like chain store where the advertising comes from corporate, or is it local? If they ever do anything locally, offer to do it for them- even if you do it for free, it would give you experience, and actually give you printed samples of your work. The other person that posted had some negative things to say about it, and sometimes it can be trying with certain customers, so you really do have to love it. And from my experience, if you establish a good relationship with the clients and your company, they get to a point where they trust your work and decisions, and don't watch over you. Most places I've worked let me do my own thing as long as the job gets done and the customers are happy. Usually the people that are watched over are the ones that make a lot of mistakes that make a company look bad (like typos, poor grammar, lack of creativity), but there are exceptions.

79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	To get people to go to your website effectively, you have two options, spend time or spend money.    For gaining traffic to your website without cost, you will be looking at some time being spent.    Back links are very important and can arguably be the best way to increase your website exposure. Effective back links are one way links (meaning not a link exchange) from other websites to yours. For example, had you put a link to your website in your question, you would have created a back link as yahoo instantly indexes the Q&A section of their website. Even Google picks it up. You can build back links in placing your url in ads such as craigslist, creating or comenting on blogs on wordpress and myspace as well as other blogging websites. These are all methods that give you white hat back links.    There is also a new website that has grown in Alexa (an independant website ranking company) by over 18,000,000 in just three weeks called www.SayItAloud.com that allows you to write articles that, if they are sponsored, will actually pay you for your article.  They have a sales staff that prmotes your writings to related companies who would be interested in advertising on your site and pay you up to $135 per article.  The site is not officially launched but several people have made money and they have over 200 people writing right now.  You can promote your site in both your profile and articles.  You can use the money you get from there to utilize some paid methods.    Caution: do not pay for your back links through back linking companies. This is considered black hat SEO and will actually drop your ranking or get you suspended all together from the big boys of search engines.    As far as paid methods, look at pay per click as a great option. PPC is the process of advertising your business on a search engine within the sponsored results. You choose what keyword phrases you are willing to pay for being in, I.e. Website design.For cost effectiveness, consider narrowing your results as much as possible. For example, Sacramento website design instead of website design would be a more focused result and would by proxy cost much less than the broad term.    SIA Professional Services has an articles section in their website which has a ton of website marketing tips that should help you at www.siaservices.net just go to their blog or their articles section.    Be sure you are submitting your website on a regular basis, especially whenever you are doing some good updates on your site. The search engines will see your site being updated on a regular basis and index you accordingly. There are some free submission sites, but I have seen in my experience that those don't nearly perform as well on a regular basis as professional SEO and marketing companies.    There is plenty more that you can do, but hopefully this give you a good starting point.    Good Luck and hope this helps|`|bOaossffaa	SEO will be a great help for you.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor.  A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a  particular real estate listing.  The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7.  Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|AmqQ9it5aa	Culver's minimum hiring age is 14 with a workers permit.

AA10236380	There have been hundreds of questions posted about how to start a home-based, internet-based business.  Most are just an excuse for spammers to reply with a bunch of get-rich-quick scam suggestions.    Here's the deal: running a business over the internet is the HOW, not the WHAT.    Step one is to identify an appropriate, promising business idea - one where you've identified an un or under-served market and where you have some expertise in the products or services to be provided...let's say hand-building custom, one of a kind guitars, for instance.    Step two islook to see if there are ways that this these products or services could be effectively provided over the internet.  A guitar can be cheaply shipped, so internet sales work fine on that level, but it's also something that a customer usually wants to handle in person before purchasing, so that could be a challenge.  Could you overcome that concern with online video testimonials from respected players?  Maybe.  It'd be pretty easy to promote the web site and product through a variety of other web sites and magazines that guitar collectors check out often, so that's a plus.    Bottom line: any business, home-based or not, web-based or not, needs to offer a product or service with a clear competitive advantage over its alternatives.  Businesses that sell over the web need to offer products/services that customers will be happy to receive via the web - that means a time lag while a product is shipped to them, an inability to experience the product firsthand before the purchase, etc.|`|mNjjSPdVaa	I not only thought about it, I did it.|`|AA11928330	I also did it too!

Second, it's your money not his.  Therefore you have to take responsibility and monitor your investments.  I don't know who you're dealing with, but many brokerage houses use the fancy term "financial adviser" for their sales force.  It is not his job to watch your stocks.  It's his job to make commissions fo0r his company.

79b265d392525b206ff870687ec9a303aa	Clicking on your site will do you no good.  Google uses the IP of your computer to see that it is you on your website.  You can use Google Analytics or you can go to www.alexa.com and type in your website.      It will tell you where your site ranks and track your growth for you.  There are really no shortcuts to gaining traffic.  You have to remember that you just thought about that where Google has been paying people to thwart that for years.    There are plenty of things that you can do to increase your website traffic and increase you ranking though that should help you.    To get people to go to your website effectively, you have two options, spend time or spend money.    For gaining traffic to your website without cost, you will be looking at some time being spent.    Back links are very important and can arguably be the best way to increase your website exposure. Effective back links are one way links (meaning not a link exchange) from other websites to yours. For example, had you put a link to your website in your question, you would have created a back link as yahoo instantly indexes the Q&A section of their website. Even Google picks it up. You can build back links in placing your url in ads such as craigslist, creating or comenting on blogs on wordpress and myspace as well as other blogging websites. These are all methods that give you white hat back links.    There is also a new website that has grown in Alexa (an independant website ranking company) by over 18,000,000 in just three weeks called www.SayItAloud.com that allows you to write articles that, if they are sponsored, will actually pay you for your article.  They have a sales staff that prmotes your writings to related companies who would be interested in advertising on your site and pay you up to $135 per article.  The site is not officially launched but several people have made money and they have over 200 people writing right now.  You can promote your site in both your profile and articles.  You can use the money you get from there to utilize some paid methods.    Caution: do not pay for your back links through back linking companies. This is considered black hat SEO and will actually drop your ranking or get you suspended all together from the big boys of search engines.    As far as paid methods, look at pay per click as a great option. PPC is the process of advertising your business on a search engine within the sponsored results. You choose what keyword phrases you are willing to pay for being in, I.e. Website design.For cost effectiveness, consider narrowing your results as much as possible. For example, Sacramento website design instead of website design would be a more focused result and would by proxy cost much less than the broad term.

Be sure you are submitting your website on a regular basis, especially whenever you are doing some good updates on your site. The search engines will see your site being updated on a regular basis and index you accordingly. There are some free submission sites, but I have seen in my experience that those don't nearly perform as well on a regular basis as professional SEO and marketing companies.

xoqQbHi1aa	Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. There is a better way.<br>  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  <br>  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan|`|2MtrGtPCaa	Need money for bills?<br>  I suggest you to try project payday, simply because you don't need any money up front and you can start making money within minutes.

Even with shipping charges, I usually come out ahead by shopping online, especially if an item is on sale or the company is offering free shipping. Corporations should be lobbying big-time to keep this perk.<br>  <br>  Currently, online purchases are taxable only if the company you are buying from has a storefront in your state.  I live in IL, so when buying online, I make sure I order from a company that is not going to charge me IL sales tax.

AA10666701	You shouldn't pay it off (or make any payments) because it will be taken off your report in two more years. If you pay it, it will show as paid but it will still be a bit bad because it took you so long to pay. And it will be there for 7 years.|`|AA11556580	The longer a debt remains unpaid, the less impact it has on your credit.  Paying a debt that's been dormant for so long will renew the activity and your score will drop. Your score already suffered from not paying the debt the first time and to start paying it now will damage your credit again. If you were to punch yourself in the face, 5 yrs later would you do it again? Nope.<br>  Depending on what type of debt it is and what state you're in, it probably isn't legally enforceable and in two more years it won't be on your credit anymore.<br>  <br>  **- The 7 yr reporting period is not reset by paying the debt. However, as long as the account is being reported it can show recent activity, like a payment.  <br>  The report will show a lack of payment for several years, then all of a sudden you make a payment. This hurts your score more than if you would've just left it alone.<br>  If it makes you feel better, you can always pay off the debt once it falls off your report.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	Allowing negative information [that you know is yours] to stay on your report is not a good idea - no matter how old the debt may be.<br>  <br>  It is NOT true that paying an old debt will "reactivate" your account in some way. That is highly illegal and companies cannot re-age your account. It must fall off of your report 7.5 years from the date of delinquency (or last missed payment). Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 to address this issue. It states that:<br>  <br>  "...the running of the reporting period canot be adjusted just because one of the following events or actions occur:<br>  1. Creditor sells or transfers the debt;<br>  2. You respond to a post-charge off collection effort by making a payment or signing an payment agreement;<br>  3. You dispute the account or time with a credit reporting agency (CRA)".<br>  <br>  If you can pay it, pay it. It will look like you are making an effort to settle your old debts. In two years it'll be gone. <br>  I hope that helps!|`|pvnBdof1aa	Are you going through a credit repair process? If so, I can tell you the reason you "don't pay it" is because the repair company is basically telling the 3 credit reporting agencies that this is NOT your debt ,because if they don't have proof that it is (which they don't) then if you start paying it, you are admitting the debt is yours. <br>  <br>  If it gets older with no activity its easier to completely remove.|`|c5xiQ5gMaa	When you try to pay an old debt, it affects your score negatively. Your score can drop at least 40 points. ( I know been there, done that)You should of pay the debt off 5 years ago. It's hard to explain but the scoring system these credit bureaus used is complicated. Yes it's your debt, but the damage was done the first time a negative mark for a debt goes on your credit report. That's why you should pay your bills on time.|`|k8U6zIAUaa	The credit scoring formula places high value in recent activity.

tw44fqCpaa	As a full time student your college address is irrelevant as that address is considered you living home for tax purposes.  If you were independent paying your own tuition and own rent than the separate address would matter.  You qualify as the full time student for the tax year (5 months).  Support is probably still in your parents favor too as tuition counts (paying tuition with student loan proceeds is the same as paying out of your own pocket for tax purposes).  It's unlikely that if you add up the year you provided more than 50% of your own support.  Your parents should claim you for the 2008 tax year.  There is nothing here that would prompt an audit.  No worries.|`|NzKaYTiQaa	Be considered a full time student is based on the standards of the school.  If the school considers you a full time student then so does the IRS.

You state that your "former home" was refinanced and you refer to your "ex-husband;" does this mean that there was a divorce? To whom did the Court award the home? This is a vital piece of information because if both of your names were on the original deed, he just can't refinance the home w/o your signature on some paperwork. And in most jurisdictions, when the Court awards the family home to one of the spouses in a divorce action, a quit claim deed is completed by the reliquishing spouse and recorded in the Deed Records. A history for change of ownership for any property is imperative but a refinance is not necessarily evidence of a change of ownership.|`|1NaeY81Faa	In order for your name to still be on the Deed you would have had to resign a Grant Deed.
