AA11452852	1.  Dwight Eisenhower took office as President after being re-elected in a landslide.    A group of young black students (known as the Little Rock Nine) brave terrible taunts and threats to attend school in Little Rock, Arkansas.  President Eisenhower has to send in the 101st Airborne Division to protect them. (More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock...    2.

IM7nzdjbaa	I live in Illinois too.  Okay so when I got my permit, what I brought was my social security card, my birth certificate, the money to pay the fee (I think it was like $20 but I can't remember exactly how much), and a parent.  I think that was it!  Good luck!    (& PS the test is extremelly easy)
25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i dont know this for a fact, but i would assume if you give them the cat, they will not let you take it back.  if you tell them you want to rehome it, but keep the cat, they will tell you when they found it a home.    sadly, unless you find it a home yourself, few adult cats make it out of shelters.    it really is better off being put down then living in a cage.    and, pay attention to where yahoo wants to put your question, they usually choose the silliest place and you have to change it.

AA12391520	Burgerville frequently hires people with a record, but I don't know how serious a charge they go up to before they won't accept an application.  I know that they do have people that are in work release programs, and people that have completed programs elsewhere and then switched jobs.  You can visit a local restaurant to apply in person, or apply online at Burgerville.com.

Gs3awxwUaa	Hi Christina    check my blog for ways to make to make extra money to help pay your bills
zBT0VC6Uaa	Where are they offering to do the paint?  Where I live, they are painting the curb.  The idea is that the fire trucks, ambulances, etc. can't easily see the numbers on the house, so having them right on the curb will save precious seconds in an emergency.  It made sense to me, so I paid for it the first time they came around.      But then I realized it was a mistake for my situation.  Most of the time, there is a car in front of my house at night anyway, so the number on the curb isn't usually visible.  Then, in the fall, we often have leaves there, so again, the number isn't visible.  And in the winter, there is snow, so . . . well, you get the idea.      Bottom line:  if they are going to paint in an area that will be visible year-round, then go for it.  But if the numbers are going on the curb or some other place where it can be blocked from view, save your money. What I did instead a couple of years ago is to put the house numbers on our walkway, where they *will* be obvious to visitors and emergency vehicles.    I hope this helps.  Good luck!!|`|ldpDzaolaa	fireman wouldn't need your house number, they'll just go to the one on fire, but, ambulance and police might, but, usually there is enough commotion they'll find you and get you out/help.|`|AA12367392	I live in oz but we have the same thing here it used to be A$10 and they are great cause they are fluorescent and if you need an ambulance or cab, they find you much easier, they put it in the gutter, if you are wary about them, make sure they do it first before you pay them and if you are not satisfied, dont pay them! :)|`|Mm3vSHfNaa	You are right, it's on the border between scam and service. If you really want to pay someone $20 for less than a dollar worth of paint, then you can, but why. Firefighters will have no problem finding your house if your number is up near the door where it supposed to be!    As a rule of thumb, I never use any service advertised by people taping fliers to my door, it just encourages them to put more fliers, half of which fly away and become litter, the other half get trashed, and one percent someone calls and falls into the scam, so I think best not to use them at all.
AA11452852	Why not?  Working in a supermarket is never the easiest job in the world, but it is okay if you like to be busy.  If you can get a job that close to home, it will mean you will spend no time getting to and from your job, so you will have more time for other things.  Overall, it sounds like a good deal to me.  Go for it.    Good luck!!

AA11452852	Actually, he probably won't receive his check for February until a few days *after* the first of March.  It takes a little while for them to process everything and get the check out.  If you are counting on the money, he should ask them about that.  Then, he will get paid for a full month (March) or or after April 1.    Good luck!!|`|bru2xnlRaa	Your husband should receive a paycheck for the time worked until the payday cutoff. If he is being paid monthly, then likely his pay period  will be from start day Feb 23 to end of month Feb 28. The check for this pay period will probably arrive between 3 and 5 days later. Suggest he opt for automatic deposit, this will get the funds to your account the fastest.     He will then have to work for the month of March to be paid at the end of March. Expect that pay to arrive the same, 3 to 5 days after pay period ends.     It is NOT likely he will be paid in advance for time he hasn't worked. The state doesn't want to have him owe them money for payroll should he not work the full pay period afterall. They will pay him for the hours he does work.       The State has told your husband their pay schedule upon hiring him, for reasons including so that he can budget your existing funds until the next pay period. Your husband's alternative is to take a job that pays sooner than monthly. Of course, State benefits are usually better than private industry.|`|abed6228cc4fa3ab44f27714e21500ffaa	Your husband should receive what is called an "advance" for the February pay period on Februry 27th.  That is the end of the pay period.  The advance is usually very close to the amount he would normally receive for the one week of work.  He will receive the small balance no later than the middle of March.    Here is a list of State Paydays from the Controller's Office:    http://www.sco.ca.gov/ppsd/empinfo/payda...    If you are still unsure, have your husband talk to someone in the human resources unit or his supervisor.
WrYEy6tkaa	US Airways is based in Phoenix.  You can also do contract work for hotels as a babysitter.  It's really fun.  Just call the really nice ones and ask concierge what babysitting service they use and then call the agency and tell them you're interested.  It pays surprisingly well.|`|GPb20iOXaa	Kelly I am on the saaaaaaaaaaame boat!! Not to mention 5 years in the military and I didnt even get hired at Trader Joes!!

I dont know what AZ is looking for in an employee but from the places Ive been to out here I KNOW for a fact that I can do a waaaaaaay better job then a lot of these people they've hired. I seriously dont know what it is but Im thinkin about goin right back into the military. This is pretty damn sad. If you want maybe we can hit up a few job fairs or go job hunting together. Anywho Ms. Kelly take care and I wish you the best finding a job.

They do a good professional job and have traditionally been less expensive than other chains.      Also MACC & Company on lower Brownsboro is a good one (not a beauty school, it's a full-fledged salone)
20LnuCejaa	It also could be misplaced.  Make sure you have searched everywhere.  We had a situation where camera equipment was missing after a move.  Looked high and low for 2 months and finally located it in an unlikely place.  Thought crossed our mind that the movers might have taken it, but that was not the case.    When you have a police report, try to recover from your home owners insurance.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	It seems you've done everything you can do.  I've moved many times and never had anything stolen.  Was the ring not insured?  Did you declare it as a valuable when you signed the moving contract?  If not, you may have a problem.|`|e0d78770d4a9419c98a1e175ba21a9bfaa	yes it happens often because they know the company they work for has insurance on all your stuff and will pay you off|`|0n0zw1Sfaa	beat the piss outta the movers with an allen wrench....    but on a serious note go to the company and let them know, say you will sue the company if the ring is not returned (TRUST me that will work)
pcHp7Dgkaa	My daughters all prefer Portmans to any other shops for the type of office wear you're looking for. We always seem to find something just right in there.    EDIT:  My girls also suggest that you try Witchery. They're a little bit more expensive than Portmans, but always worth a look for the type of clothes you're after.|`|ahsgk6bXaa	Katies is good for inexpensive work clothes, so is the Jacquie E outlet shop at Stones Corner. There are two DFOs in Brisbane that have a wide range of clothing, one near the Brisbane airport and a smaller one at Jindalee.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Head to the Brisbane Airport and look at the huge complex of factory direct outlets located at the start of Airport Drive. Turn right onto Lomandra Drive.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	Try one of the Millers outlets.|`|ZYCovPREaa	I'd highly suggest going to Barkins.    They have work outfits, shoes and accessories, all up to date with current trends and is very affordable considering the quality of the items.    There is a store in Brisbane in Edward St.     And at the DFO at Bris Airport there is a Table Eight clearance store which is the outlet for Barkins.

AA10370161	Ayant habit quelques annes dans la rgion de Figueres, je pense que tu devrais choisir une grosse banque (BBVA, BCH ou Popular) si tu veux profiter de leurs services quand tu seras dans la rgion de Valence (rseaux les plus complets en Espagne). Beaucoup des Cajas ou caixas sont assez locales (sauf Cajamadrid ou la Caixa, mais elles sont quand mme plus rgionales que les banques.

VxfyQZ2jaa	The JazzFest is held at the Fairgrounds, which is not within realistic walking distance of downtown,  There are are not any hotels close to the Fairgrounds.     Best is to stay at a hotel in the French Quarter, Central Business District, or Warehouse District.  That was you are within walking distance of everything downtown.      There is limited parking at the Fairgounds.  DO NOT try to park in the neighborhoods arounf the Fairgrounds.  The area is safe, but scores of Parking Control Agents and dozens of Parking Control tow trucks will be combing the area looking for illegally parked cars to take to the impound lot. It is a residential neighborhood and the residents have complained for decades about cars blocking their driveways, etc. during JazzFest so the City responded with "zero tolerance" parking enforcement.     Many hotels operate shuttles to the fairgrounds for JazzFest, Grey line operates them, and the transit authority can also get you there:    http://www.graylineneworleans.com/  www.norta.com    There are lots of taxis (you will have to pay the "special event" rate):    http://www.unitedcabs.com/id1.html    The JazzFest website has a link for hotels:    http://www.nojazzfest.com/    Another option is to rent an apartment via New Orleans Bed & Breakfast:    nobba@cox.net  888-240-0070/504-561-0447    There are literally thousands of restaurants.  Call first to see if a reservation is impartant during JazzFest:    http://bestofneworleans.com/gyrobase/Din...     Hope you have a great time!
