20080328190519AAnFPVm	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Help!! Fuel leak on 95 chrysler new yorker?	I am trying to find out why my 95 chrysler new yorker is leaking fuel, it is leaking near the injectors on the passenger side..   When I bought the car the previous owner said that It had a fuel leak but had it fixed. he provided receipts from the mechanic, however it was still leaking so I took it back to the mechanic who preformed the repairs and he told me that he has bought the o ring set from the dealer, he knows he installed them correctly, so mabey its the injectors. well I came home and took the cover off and could see it leaking from the second one back. I went and bought the new injector, replaced it and now its leaking worse. It looks like the hole that the injector sits in is fairly large and would need a seal of some sort to stop it from leaking... I called every part store but theres not a seal available. It had some sort of rubbery crap peeling off, it looked like silicone on the old injector but if I tried to put that back on it would fall in the hole the injector sat in

Guessing I get the boat to go 3-5 mph.  I noticed the throttle body on the carb was only opening slightly and can open it at least 3/4 more by hand.

20090227171812AAnMrYS	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Is it worth it too get repairs done or just buy a new/used car?	Alright so here's the situation. We bought our van in October 2004, Ford Freestar. My mom liked it at first sight so yeah, anywase it was used, came with about 30,000k already on it, no accidents, cost us just about  $40,000 (SES trim). Yesterday my mom tries to drive out of the parking stall and can't get into gear at all, Reverse Drive First and Third won't go, I don't know if she tried Neutral or park but yeah. Ford inspected it today and gave us an estimate of $6,800CAD. Supposedly what needs to be replaced is the transmission, left Trans axle, intake control?, motor stuck irc, switch for brake lights and there's something wrong with the engine. Considering that were going to Scotland in August with my band and flights cost around 10,000CAD were in a bit of trouble. This van has been in and out of the shop more than my Dad’s 2006 Toyota Camry which has only gone in once since he bought it. The question is      Should we end up getting this fixed and just keep the car? Or buy a new/used vehicle?       My mom doesn’t want another van and we can’t afford anything over $25,000. She’s more into an SUV. I was thinking a Toyota Highlander or the Hybrid would be good but they have a pretty high resale value. After this fiasco my Dad won’t get another Ford. What do you guys recommend?

First off, how big does a hole in a radiator of a 2 seat economy car (Escort) have to be in order to cause a complete breakdown, rendering the car undriveable beyond, say, 10 miles?       And secondly, what normally puts a hole in a radiator? Could a water pump breaking in any way consequently damage the radiator? Like maybe the fan hitting it?       Reason I ask such specific questions is I'm trying to determine whether or not my mechanic put the hole in my radiator himself in order to get more money....

I am absolutely a car fanatic, and I know everything there is about the German brands, and some Japanese brands, which is why I picked these cars below. I need a car reliable, comfortable, good looking, safe, fair amount of money to maintain.      2003 BMW Z4 3.0, or 2.5, I prefer the 3.0 15k-16k   In-Line 6, with 225 hp.   2004 BMW 325CI 15-16k   Inline- 6, with 184 hp.   2005 Infiniti G35 Coupe 15-16k   Six Cylinders, with 298 Hp      I have a job, and cool parents who'll pay insurance, and gas, probably half the maintenance. They will help me on any trouble I get, which I hope I don't, cause these cars seem pretty reliable to me. I'll have about 7.2k + by then. spending about 3200 on a down payment.

I filled the rear tires with more air and it felt as though the shaking got worse. i was thinking it could be my rear tires cause I just got two new front tires, but the rear ones were not so bad.

I was thinking it could be the STRUTS, since I never changed them and i have 100,000 miles         I just need idea;s on what the problem could be.
