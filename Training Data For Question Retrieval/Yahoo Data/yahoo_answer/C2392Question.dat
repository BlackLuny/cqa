20070715190829AA8OcKc	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I Transfer High Schools for my Senior Year?	Hi, this is my first time posting.. I have been at a school in California for 3 years, so I am going into Junior year. I have been very unhappy socially at this school. I have applied, and have been accepted to transfer into another high school in the county. It is not as academically rigorous of a high school, but I think that I will be happier for my senior year. It is lower ranked in California. My fear is that this interdistrict transfer would affect me adversely in the college admissions process or that it may raise a red flag to an admissions officer? I have a 4.04 GPA and 2000 SAT and I am scared of my class rank dropping since the worse school offers more Honors/AP classes in sophomore year, and many students have very high gpas. On the other hand, I would be able to enroll in more AP/Honors classes because they are not as rigorous at this school.      Please help me make this very difficult decision. Will this hurt or maybe even help my college chances?    Please help. Thank you.

The variable t is time in seconds, and s is the height of the object in feet.      a) If a rock is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 32 feet per second from the top of a 40-foot building, write the height equation using this information       AND HERE IS WHAT I CAME UP WITH FOR THE ANSWER:   s=-16t^2+32t+40   S=-16(.5)^2+32(.5)+40   S=-16(.25)+16+4   S= -4+16+4   S=16         BUT THERE IS A PART TWO FOR THIS AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO CALCULATE IT.  I don't need someone to do it for me, just to explain HOW to do it.      After how many seconds will the rock reach maximum height and what is the maximum height?

Aussit?t, le disciple se tourne vers son mentor et lui dit : "Grand Ma?tre, veuillez pardonner par avance mon impertinence mais quel est donc le sens profond de cet adage ?"      Le Ma?tre : "?, jeune et perturbé disciple, sache donc du plus loin de ton inexpérience que, s’il est vrai qu’autant la femme que la perle se peuvent enfiler, la perle, elle, le peut être par les deux bouts".      Le jeune disciple fronce les sourcils et ose : "mais Grand Ma?tre,veuillez pardonner mon impertinence, et me chatier si je le mérite, mais n’est-il pas vrai que la femme puisse également s’enfiler par les deux bouts ?"      Le Ma?tre : "ah, jeune et indiscipliné que tu es, juste celà est, mais dans ce cas, c’est une perle !".

It is a fact that the US Federal Reserve System has played an enormous role of a Central bank since 1913, it has controlled the money supply and credit as well within the economy. Although this information is true, since 1913, several financial institutions and regulatory bodies were setup in the economy, which caused the main Federal Reserve System to lose the efficient control of the credit operations in the country that it had gained. 
20081112203256AAgBPyz	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is it illegal for a university to hold a transcript?	 my original question just got deleted. so anywayjust recently quit going to this art school that wasnt teaching me anything, which is why i left in the first place. im still a student, and im broke. i've talked to a lawyer who thinks its illegal to hold a transcript, but she told me to see what i can do and then take it from there, if not they'll make them(this isnt what i hired a lawyer for). anyways, the thing is, i tell her that i cant pay the full amount, so she lowers it. i tell her i cant pay that, so she lowers it again, which leads me to believe that if she wanted to just give me the transcript, she could. what do you guys think?

20090128212513AAgPKpB	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I don't know what to do about college?	I go to a community college and have been since Fall '07. I decided that I wanted to transfer to the local university this fall so I went to see my counselor. The only thing holding me back is math, which is not at the 100 level but is only one level away from it (73). My counselor said that I can stay another semester then transfer in Spring '10. Then he gave me some options as to what I can do other than stay. He told me to think about it and come back to tell him what I've planned.      Before this was brought to her attention my mom bugged me about having to stay at a community college for so long. Now that I've decided to transfer she's completely changed her mind and WANTS me to stay at the community college a little longer. She gave me a long lecture about why I should, then she told me to think about it.      *Sigh*      I want to go transfer NOW, but I don't want to let anybody down (esp. my mom) with my decision. My mom told me that once I get into the university I can't get out.      Help?

I am a high school senior, graduating with a 3.86 GPA this year. I got a 2060 on the SAT, and I will have taken and passed 5 AP Exams after I graduate, Chemistry, Biology, Calculus, US History, and European History. I am going to be taking some SAT Subject Tests this spring, Math, Bio, and Chem, and I was wondering if it would hurt my chances of admission to a good school like Stanford if I took this year off to improve my SAT score and get some work experience or something.    I only applied to the University of Washington and Western Washington University, and I missed the deadlines of many other schools. If I raise my SAT up (actually studying for it this time) to like 2150, and do well on the subject tests, do I still have a shot at somewhere like Stanford or Berkeley despite having taken a year off?   I hear that the UW is not accepting very many people, even with my current credentials, and I just want to know if I could make it into one of these schools.

"listen" before you make a statement, it means you're not a leftist?      I think i read that somewhere. If you say "look", even if what you say next is not political at all, it still indicates that you are a lefty.      Example -      "Look, I told you I am not getting you a puppy".

So basically this is what I've taken/taking      Freshman:   Honors English 9   Honors World History 9   Honors Advanced Algebra 2   Honors Chemistry   French 2   P.E/Health 9   Speech and Debate   Web Design 1      Sophmore:   Honors English 10   Honors American History 10   Honors Pre-Calculus   AP Biology   AP Environmental Science   P.E/Health 10   French 3      Junior:   AP English Language   AP Government   AP European History   AP Psychology   AP Caluculus AB   AP Statistics   French 4      So the question is senior year. The main thing is whether or not I should take Senior Inquiry (takes up 4 classes but you get college credit for it) or 4 AP Classes      Already Decided:   AP English Literature   AP Economics   AP Calculus BC      Considering:   Senior Inquiry   AP Physics   AP U.S History   AP Music Theory (I play seven instruments and have studied theory since I was a toddler so i think i'll be okay)   French 5   AP Chemistry?   AP Art?      So at the current moment I'm leaning towards not taking Senior Inquiry and taking 4 AP Classes instead. So far I've taken 3 science classes and fit the requirements to graduate and for any college, but I want to send the impression that I'm a well rounded student, but science is my weakest point. So I really don't want to take it, because I know I'll struggle.      [[Question marks mean that I've pretty much ruled out that class, but it's still open for me to take]]

I don't see any options other than taking out a loan and going to a community college for 2 years and transferring to another college.    Majority of my friends are either receiving full scholarships and going to state colleges or receiving partial scholarships taking a loan for the rest and going to the state colleges, i don't know what the first 2 years of a state college are like but i feel like I'm missing out and ruining good years of my life, I'm going to transfer to a state college after the first 2 years of community college but I feel as if i won't have a nice college experience like my friends.

Do you guys have any suggestions. Here is what I am looking for.      First off, I want it to be a good school. No average public schools (Cal State whatever).      Second, I want it to be good in the liberal arts. I am looking to major in English, Journalis, Communications, Marketing, or Business. So any school ending in Tech probably isn't up my ally.      Third, I'd like to have a college with some tradition. While schools near me, UC San Diego/Santa Barbara are good schools they aren't steeped in tradition. I like schools that are a little older and have a good reputation for academics, athletics, and extracurricurals.      Here some schools that I've found:   Notre Dame   Northwestern   Marquette   Syracuse   Michigan   St. Louis      Any suggestions?

20070812144001AAmrNEN	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Gimmie A Good Proxy?	I need a really good, new proxy for school. And no, before you start, I'm not like the other millions of teenie boppers trying to get around the myspace block. However, my school does this really dumb thing where they block really good informing sites based on some obscure wording. So when you try to reasearch stuff for a paper and find a really good site, its blocked even though there is nothing wrong with it. So please, help me out. I'd like to do my research for my research paper at school so I can type it a home. And none of those dumb *** lectures about how wrong proxies are. If you don't have a proxy, don't answer this question.
