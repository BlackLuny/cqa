1Bto3sZeaa	Interesting you say that... that is, that anyone with over a 20% 'best answer' score is 'cheating/has a second (or third, fourth, etc., etc.) account'.  That is shallow of you.  I had another yahoo! account that I've since deleted.  Under it I had a 56% Best Answer rating.  Had been a Yahoo! Answers member under that name from early 2006 - late 2007.  If you look at my answers thus far under this name, you can see why I [might] get best answers and/or a high percentage of best answers, at least I hope.  I leave detailed, very helpful answers, including links to back up my opinions/answers/claims.  That is why I got best answers over half the time under my other s/n... not by cheating the system.  Maybe you should try my tried and true method.<br>  <br>  I don't look at my 'success' record though, I think of it, that is, answering people's questions here as making me feel better that I'm making someone else feel better, and easing their mind(s).  So it's a wonderful double-edged sword.  The person I'm answering benefits from a wise answer that helps them, which, in turn helps me feel great that I helped someone in need.  <br>  <br>  Try looking at things that way.<br>  <br>  I wish you prosperity in all that you do.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	333 Points<br>  33% <br>  No Questions Asked<br>  <br>  <br>  Where the Son is present, both the Father & Spirit are present|`|30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	I have a score of over 20% and I do not have a second account.

Lx5nEpT0aa	Luke 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.<br>  <br>  In the Greek text, it is "Behold I have given you the power..." The enemy is Satan, the one that will "fall as lightning from heaven onto the earth". The serpents are the Kenites, the children of Satan, through his son Cain from the garden of Eden. The Scorpions are the fallen angels, that will be booted out of heaven on to the earth right along with Satan. Revelation 12:9 "And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him." This next time takes place at the sixth trump, and we will see these fallen angels of Satan here on earth in our generation.|`|30c23719ae8384dcfe8ecff1164d60cbaa	Nothing as no one can cast a magic spell on me.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	Are you for real?<br>  <br>  There is no magic.<br>  <br>  Grow up and stop being a primitive.|`|vUSLyZzZaa	say Jesus Christ and the magic will flee.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Just go on about your normal, every day routine.|`|AA10641825	Church folks cast spells on me at work.

It's not rocket science.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	You don't say what makes you think "this fellow" is a practitioner of magic and would know how to cast a spell on you?<br>  <br>  Honestly, it sounds more like you came in contact with a virus and are coming down with a cold or flu, considering it is the season for it.  No magic involved there.  On your way back from the cathedral, you may want to stop at the drug store and pick up some cold/flu medicine, drink plenty of juice, and get some rest.  If you're still experiencing the shivers and body pains in a week or so, consult your doctor.|`|dFBccLExaa	Well there is nothing that says that someone case something on you, as most curses are nothing of the sort. Not to meniton that most of the things that would help don't fall into a Christian realm... sooooo I guess it depends on how badly you want to fix things, or what you'd want to try to attempt to fix things. <br>  Usually, to get something off of you, you need to cleanse your body and mind, and then banish whatever is being attached to you. Cleansing can be done by yourself or a priest, and there are a variety of things that can cleanse. Banishments are done usually with black fabric and can be used to remove negativity and reflect it back to it's sender. <br>  But really, a curse is as strong as you let it be. You can break a curse through sheer will, if you wanted.

I cannot remember but there are two more points that determine action and its result.<br>  <br>  If daily, month after month and year after year, aware of little lies, it will add up and give the resulting reaction. <br>  <br>  There are also certain situations in where little lie can be said. <br>  <br>  I suggest you read the following contained in the following web page:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://buddhanet.net/ebooks_g.htm" rel="nofollow">http://buddhanet.net/ebooks_g.htm</a><br>  <br>  Only We Can Help Ourselves — Ven. Dhammavuddho.|`|aUpPSmQKaa	Hi! Karma is a very old Eastern concept that is based upon one of the many Cosmic Laws. These are similar to the Laws of Physics, but are irrefutable and well beyond the comprehension of man (at the moment!).<br>  <br>  I can't go into Metaphysics here as it is just not the place + there is not enough space either so let me just tel you what happens in basic terms.<br>  <br>  As you know, everything that exists is made up of atoms and the state of matter depends entirely upon the rate of vibrations of its atoms - solid's atoms are tightly packed together (relatively speaking) and vibrate slower than the atoms in liquids. Your soul/spirit or whatever you choose to call it also vibrates but at a very, very high level and when you do an evil deed or think an evil thought you directly affect the rate of vibration of your spirit and its frequency drops. You also have a thing that encapsulates your entire body called the Aura and this to is affected when you commit a sin etc - the colours become muddier. (Again,not the place to go into details about the Aura). And of course the other part of Karma is the part you mention in your question. Now telling a white lie is nothing to get unduly worried about for your leg will not suddenly fall off as a result of it. Live a good life, deliberately hurt no one (animals included), and if you do something that you know to be wrong, try to make it right and genuinely show remorse and you will be OK. Don't become paranoid about the concept of Karma - just remember it is there the next time you are tempted go astray.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped a bit.|`|aGynBPbCaa	you bring around your own karma.  If your always worrying that the lie you told your girlfriend is going to result in something bad happening to you, you act a different way.  Reclusive, pensive, ect...  Then when your girlfriend cheats on you because you've been a shut in, you think its karma.  Thats a little overboard with an example... I hope that didn't happen to you.<br>  <br>  Anyways, you worrying about the universe getting back at you brings your own punishment.  Being worried all the time bites.|`|AA10411777	I do beleive in it but i think it deals with intent and final outcome of actions and not just intent example you lie to your mother by saying she has lost weight that would be a good thing.

Por·nei′a is related to the verb por·neu′o, meaning “to give one’s self to unlawful sexual intercourse.”<br>  <br>  The best way to understand what is taken in by these terms is to find out how they are used in other places. A similar word appears in the Bible at Jude?7 in describing the sin of certain ancient cities: “Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise acted immorally [an intensive form of por·neu′o] and indulged in unnatural lust, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.” (RSV) For what type of ‘immorality’ or por·nei′a were those at Sodom and Gomorrah condemned? The Bible narrative at Genesis 19:4, 5 answers:<br>  <br>  “The men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from boy to old man, all the people in one mob. And they kept calling out to Lot and saying to him: ‘Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have intercourse with them.’”<br>  <br>  These men of Sodom and Gomorrah were homosexuals. In fact, the English word “sodomy,” which particularly means ‘intercourse between two men,’ is drawn from the name of the city of Sodom. The Bible would call their sin por·nei′a. Jesus said por·nei′a was so wrong morally that it was a basis for severing the marriage bond.<br>  <br>  Further, remember that Jesus was a Jew living under the law of Moses. His use of por·nei′a, says Edward Robinson’s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament, apparently includes ‘all intercourse interdicted by the Mosaic Law.’ That Law included among its injunctions: “Do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman; it is an abhorrence.” (Lev. 18:22, The Torah, The Five Books of Moses, by the Jewish Publication Society of America) Por·nei′a, the word used by Jesus, obviously embraced this command of God.<br>  <br>  Also, it should be noted that homosexuality had been condemned by God before the law of Moses was even given. The account about Sodom and Gomorrah, referred to earlier, proves this fact; those cities were destroyed by God over 400 years before the law of Moses came into existence. Jesus was aware of that.—Luke 17:28, 29, 32.|`|ZOifSvNhaa	Anyone can choose to be a parrot but since the text in the bible clearly states that homosexuality is unnatural and condemed by god; and the bible has SUCH A LONG record of accuracy.

AA11058044	You are absolutely right, and there are many, many people who do believe that life was created by God, and after that the diversity of life was formed through evolution.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing in the theory of evolution which precludes the existence of a god if you so choose to believe.<br>  <br>  There's also absolutely nothing in the theories of abiogenesis or the big bang which preclude the idea that either or both of them were precipitated by some sky dude.  In fact, many scientists initially rejected the big bang theory because it sounded too much like Creation.<br>  <br>  You don't hear much about atheists supporting the theory of abiogenesis on here because most of the people attacking evolution on here can't tell the difference between the theories of evolution, abiogenesis and the big bang theory - along with about a half dozen other theories.  So most of their attacks are aimed at evolution, and thus it is the most vigorously defended.<br>  <br>  Also, as you pointed out, none of these theories actually have anything to do with atheism.  It's just that pretty much 100% of atheists support these theories (as they don't have any preconceived religious ideas to contradict them), and most of the people who know the most about them are also atheists.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	"If both of these are true why try to argue that God did not create us because of Evolution."<br>  <br>  I don't.

Who in their right mind would want to hang out with people like this?<br>  <br>   I know atheists personally that are spiritual and believe in a higher consciousness of 'some kind,' just not your religious - conditional - limited - god.<br>  <br>  This wasn't meant to be a rude answer, just speaking objectively.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	1) Yes.<br>  2) Yes.<br>  3) I'm not the one arguing.  You will find that it is the christians who are against evolution because they feel that god created species as they are today, and species did not evolve from other species as evolution proves.  Perhaps you will do better asking your brethren about their position.<br>  4) Abiogenesis does not have the mountains of evidence that evolution has to support it.  However, there are some interesting data that shows formation of some basic amino acids in experiments that combined elements with energy.<br>  5) I do not need to prove any god does not exist.  I do not need to prove to you that the invisible pink unicorn does not exist.  You will not believe in it.  The burden of proof is on the positive claimant.  You claim some god exists.  Hence the burden of proof is on you.  The default position is no beliefs until sufficient evidence is presented.|`|2eGgbhVoaa	I believe in all religions and none. I believe in evolution.

But then again, most of the theists who try to argue against evolution don't even know what the theory is about and often try to mix it with the big bang theory. Honestly, I don't try to explain abiogenesis to the theists, or anyone for that matter, because I don't feel I'm fully educated enough in it to do so.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't try to prove god does not exist. The burden of proof is on the positive claim.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Ockham's razor.  The simplest answer is the correct one.<br>  <br>  Evolution can occurr without outside interference.  Therefore, there was no interference.  There is still not proof of any god.<br>  <br>  Abiogenesis is new in the grand scheme of things.  It has not had the years of research as evolution has.  It has not had the supporting experiments evolution has.  And, if I am not mistaken, Abiogenesis is not a scientific theory yet.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Science doesn't address the supernatural. You may believe God directed Evolution, you may believe God started life with abiogenesis, you may believe God initiated the Universe, but these claims cannot be verified and are therefore irrelevant to me.<br>  <br>  The belief in the supernatural is a choice - Yes or no, but it doesn't matter what you chose, but how you practice that belief.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	I accept evolution- I couldn't care less about proving God doesn't exist and even if I did I wouldn't use evolution to do it.

Thanks for figuring that out.  There really isn't much of a theory of abiogenesis.  We don't know much about that yet, so we can't form a theory.  In fact, Darwin credited abiogenesis to a creator (read his book).  Evolution is verified and true, but we don't know much about abiogenesis yet.|`|wwdllMzYaa	i never have<br>  <br>  there could easily be a god and evolution<br>  <br>  its usually belivers and creationsists who do that<br>  as i knwowhat evolution is, i wodult do that<br>  and as many other atheists are also aware of what it is, im pretty confident in saying, they wodulnt either

To do so trivializes the victims of these events.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	These are lies and defames a God of love.No one is being punished from God.We are being punished because of the predicament we have brought upon ourselves through global warning and other ruination of the earth.(Revelation 11:18) But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give [their] reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”|`|AA11008046	God have mercy on the Christian that would make such a foolish comment.  If there was any kind of lesson in that event for any one it would not be the position of any human to say so.  There are times that God allows (not causes) pain for a reason; but it is fool hearty for any person or group of peoples to state those kinds of things, in my humble opinion.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	We don't.<br>  <br>  God did decide to use natural disasters in the past to punish people (even after the Flood) but he doesn't do that anymore.|`|yHfsHp6naa	The ones that do are ignorant and deluded.|`|FOZGMadaaa	You apparently believe everything you hear.

God said subdue the earth but the earth has subdue man. We use its resources for many things not orchestrated by God and we have become foolish in our dictatorship.<br>  <br>  We blame God and Christianity for the destruction of man.<br>  <br>  God was not in Katrina to destroy it if he was it would have been wiped of of the map. <br>  <br>  Satan comes to steal kill and destroy.God allows many things so we can understand,he wants us to consider him for who he is God. Job 42.|`|WbaN6osZaa	In some of the poorest parts of Nigeria, where evangelical religious fervour is combined with a belief in sorcery and black magic, many thousands of children are being blamed for catastrophes, death and famine - and branded witches by powerful pastors. These children are then abandoned, tortured, starved and murdered - all in the name of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  This is EXACTLY how people like Pat Robertson use natural disasters to stir up resentment against minorities.<br>  <br>  You get cynical manipulative f*cks like him, and simple, idiotic superstitious people who listen and believe what they are told.<br>  <br>  A dangerous mix.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Because they're insane. (Of course, the only ones who do say that.)<br>  <br>  Look at babies who are born with defects. Some Christians willingly go up to the parents and say to them, "See what sin does? It's punishment, and now your child has to suffer for your sins." How heartless. When did the baby ever sin to be born with deformities? How is that fair?<br>  <br>  That is exactly why there is not an all-loving god out there.|`|41ISfvXmaa	Simply because they are uninformed and uneducated. Does God do things as a "wake up call"? Absolutely, but to say that every disaster or crisis is a punishment from God is just stupid.|`|AA11308688	Simple-minded answers from simple-minded people.|`|dmCAiuMGaa	I don't know any Christians who say that.  Good generalizing though.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	that is an easy way to disconnect from an atrocity rather than helping those in need.|`|yzRHAWNhaa	What in the hell are you talking about? God loves us, and wants to see good things happen in our lives. However, if we knowingly do evil as a Christian after we are Born Again we have no more sacrifice for those sins so we have to endure punishment for them.<br>  <br>  Heb:12:7: If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?<br>  Heb:12:8: But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.<br>  Heb:12:9: Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?<br>  Heb:12:10: For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.<br>  Heb:12:11: Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lu:16:19: There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:<br>  Lu:16:20: And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,<br>  Lu:16:21: And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.<br>  Lu:16:22: And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;<br>  Lu:16:23: And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.<br>  Lu:16:24: And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.<br>  Lu:16:25: But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<br>  <br>  So if we suffer for 80 yrs. and enjoy laughter and paradise for zillions x zillions x zillions plus yrs. It really is worth every second. ? ? ? ?

When his Mother asked what he had said to the neighbor, the little boy said, "Nothing, I just helped him cry.""<br>  <br>  Children are innocent, naturally benevolent, and insightful.  If we can look at religion through the eyes of a child, we'd be more tolerant as a child would be less likely to pursue their neighbor for not agreeing with their views on God. <br>  <br>  However, just because we should be childlike in our approach to God doesn't mean we should be blind or gullible in our faiths.  You can still study, learn, grow, and search for answers. Compare, and become well versed in your chosen faith and learn about other faiths so that you may understand from unbaised and objective views about different paths.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Both, God is believed by everyone.

Jesus tells us that “There will be “signs in the sun, moon, and stars,” (Luke 21:25). Whatever these events are, they will cause many people to be in great fear about what is coming upon the world.|`|VYLEfiSTaa	Remember Jesus . For as people were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” (Matt. 24:37-39) <br>  He said keep on the watch . Signs are all around us...the gentile times ended in 1914 The year the signs started..Remember the demons who screamed at Jesus....“Did you come here to torment us before the appointed time?”—Mt 8:29. Demons know the 7 times spoken of by Daniel ,Jesus said these times had to be fulfilled.. Jesus and his angels are separating the Wheat and the Weeds , as we speak.<br>  <br>  <br>  “The Beginning of the Birthpangs”?<br>  <br>  Did World War?I with its ‘fearful sights and great signs from heaven’ prove to be “only the beginning of the birthpangs,” as The Jerusalem Bible expresses it? History answers yes. Well over a million tons of bombs were dropped from earth’s immediate heavens during World War?II. Among these were blockbusters and other six-ton devices that could penetrate about 16 feet (5 m) of solid concrete.<br>  <br>  Imagine the terror that struck the hearts of Hamburg’s residents on the night in July 1943 when a swarm of some 700 heavy aircraft bombed their city. This was repeated two nights later, causing a firestorm that claimed over 40,000 victims. “A stream of haggard, terrified refugees flowed into the neighbouring provinces,” wrote Adolf Galland. “The Terror of Hamburg spread rapidly to the remotest villages of the Reich.”<br>  <br>  Warsaw, London, Coventry, Berlin, Dresden, Tokyo, and many other cities, suffered from intense bombing. One Tokyo air raid caused a firestorm that proved even more destructive than the one in Hamburg. It claimed over 80,000 lives. After repeated air raids millions fled the city. “Tokyo’s population went from five million to two and a third million,” records historian Jablonski. A Japanese woman says: “Whenever I hear the siren of a fire truck or see logs crackling in a fireplace, my heart pounds and I relive those days of childhood terror.”<br>  <br>  World War?II introduced terrifying new weaponry. In the last year of the war, Germany began firing V-2 rockets loaded with one-ton warheads. Traveling 3,500?miles per hour (5,600 km/hr) at impact, these reached British soil only about five minutes after being launched. Then the United States dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over a hundred thousand people outright. “Allied to the atomic bomb,” explains the Encyclop?dia Britannica, “the V-2 foreshadowed the intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBMs] of the postwar era.”|`|yHfsHp6naa	They'll only exist in your imagination.|`|8D9pAEAbaa	Muhummud.|`|iHDYncuXaa	These signs of God precede the second coming of Christ.
SZdVYrSSaa	I used to date one in high school. Basically he kisses you one night, and then wants to date you. But, within a week, he used to call me a queer and hit me a lot, and as soon as we got done doing anything (holding hands, to kissing, to any form of sex) he'd remind me that he's actually straight and wanted a family and loved Jesus, but he was in love with me for now and wasn't gay, and it would never happen again with another guy. And then on a rare occasion when we were totally alone for a while, he'd warm up and be really sweet and kind, and fun, and childish, and he'd do things that were really gay.<br>  <br>  And then when that hour was over, I'd be getting beaten and called f*ggot again. And then re-lectured on how he wasn't gay and gays are going to hell. It just goes on like that in a circle basically, until finally they leave you and tell you that they aren't gay and will kill you and burn your house down and ruin your life and out you if you try to tell anyone.<br>  <br>  And then when it's been over for a while, you miss the rare sweet side you saw in him, and the excitement of the secrecy, and feel like maybe you are the only person who had the chance to see that kind of loving in them, and then you kick yourself for not trying harder to convince them that it was ok for them to be a homosexual, and then you get mad that you want someone back who was abusive, and then you don't think about them for a while, and then you feel bad for giving up on their good side and want them back again. Yet another bad circle, but this one is minus the sex.<br>  <br>  Gotta say, it's really not a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  : (|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	Someone who is homosexual but not gay.

It is not human nature to forgive, you have to seek heavenly intervention to be able to accomplish this.  I have had some experience with this and here's what I believe:  When you forgive someone you stop holding it against them and you don't bring it up to hurt them.  However if you bring it up because you are trying to understand or need answers without the intent for punishing them for it that's OK but they may not give you what you need and it could stil turn out bad.  If you feel like talking to them about it ask God first if you should and what do you really need to say. You may still become angry when you think about how you were treated but you choose each time to have self-control and ask God to help YOU do what you should do and help THEM also.  Many people hurt others because they are hurt themselves.  Think of when you've treated someone nasty; you were probably not in the best shape yourself at the time. We do not posess the ability to forget what we choose to.  If we did that experience would be useless to our development. Good luck-the most important thing is you WANT to forgive, that is what leads you to forgiveness.  Also, the verse about if you forgive others you heavenly father will forgive you but if you do not he will not; think of everything you've done that you needed God to forgive you for.  Some bad stuff, huh?  But you aren't a horible person, are you?  Most of the time when people hurt us they never even meant to even if you think their choices prove that they did mean to.

Look at the examples in the Bible:<br>  Romans 15:4  For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.<br>  <br>  Look at Joseph. Betrayed by his family, sold into slavery, falsely accused and sent to prison. God was with him. He became a mighty man of God and saved many people.<br>  <br>  Look at King David. The right person for the throne, spent years hiding in caves for his very life. He became a man with a heart for God and did many mighty things!<br>  <br>  Look at Job. Almost everything was stripped from him. God restored and blessed him even more after the trial was over.<br>  <br>  God can use faith challenges to make us into the person He needs us to be. College is a time that many have faith challenges. It was a challenging time for me as well. My girlfriend of three years broke up with me, my parents decided to not pay for my college after all, my brother totaled my car and had no money to pay me back, my best friend betrayed me. It was awful. God was there. If that hadn't happened, I would not have met my wife, I would not have finished college with her and my life would have been less than the blessing I now have.

This is how I am sure God is with me in troubled times:  I know it; I remember it.<br>  <br>  It's nice if you can have positive feelings like consolation, assurance, inner peace.  But even if you don't have those feelings, God is still there with you.  Claim it and know it as a fact.  Then when you have hard times, remember that you know it.<br>  <br>  God isn't making you succeed and He won't cause you to fail.  That is you, your efforts and hard work.

This is the normative way to receive grace, a gift of the holy spirit.  It is the way in which the human person can hear the words of forgiveness with the assurance that you have been forgiven.  The human person needs to hear these words as is the way in normal life.  You will not hear these words in the middle of the woods with you and God and you will not receive the grace to carry on.  Regular confession is beneficial in identifying your weaknesses|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello Pink,<br>  <br>  Believe me that I and many other Catholics would rather do it the way you mention but this scenario of verses should explain why the Catholic church does what she does:<br>  <br>  In the economy of the New Testament, the Lord wanted the Church to be a universal sacrament of salvation. The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council teaches that "the Church, in Christ, is in the nature of sacrament—a sign and instrument, that is, of communion with God" (Lumen gentium, n. 1). It is God's will that the forgiveness of sins and the return to divine friendship should be mediated by the Church's action: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Mt 16:19), Jesus solemnly said to Simon Peter, and in him to the Supreme Pontiffs, his successors. He also entrusted the same task to his Apostles and, in them, to the Bishops, their successors: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Mt 18:18). On the evening of the very day of the Resurrection, Jesus would make this power effective by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit: "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (Jn 20:23). Because of this mandate, the Apostles and their successors in priestly charity would henceforth be able to say with humility and truth: "I absolve you from your sins"... <br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|2e34ws6zaa	James 5:16 (New International Version)<br>  <br>  "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective."|`|i5DVnoDIaa	Our Lord Jesus Christ said to His apostles: “I give ye the power to bind and loose the sins of men. Whosoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whosoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matt. 18:18). The apostles took this gift and this power, and successively passed it on to their disciples and to divine hierarchs - from the times of the apostles to this very day, and the hierarchs ordained priests, endowing them with the same power - to bind and loose the sins of men. This should be a matter of belief for everyone who comes to confession and lowers his head under the epitrahelion and hand of a priest of God. Moreover, you should not be troubled by the circumstance of the priest being a man like yourself, suffering the same temptations as other people and being not free of sins, which he also confesses to his father-confessor. However, it is not the angels whom the Lord entrusted to free penitents of their sinful burden, but humans, lawfully ordained priests; we must not inquire into the reason for this, but should obey Christ and believe without any doubt that a true remission of sins is granted through the priest, and that all those who have confessed properly leave confession with a soul as pure as after the sacrament of baptism. For this reason it is said about confession and the sacrament of penitence that “penitents are baptized with a second baptism.”<br>  <br>  <br>  But it is most important to confess properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  First of all, it is absolutely necessary to make peace with everyone before coming to confession. The Lord said: “Forgive and ye shall be forgiven. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your trespasses” (Matt. 6:15). In that case, even if the priest, who does not possess the gift of clairvoyance as saints do, says to the penitent: “I forgive and loose thou of all thy sins,” Christ Himself, Who stands here invisibly and accepts the confession of those who repent properly, will quietly say to the one who has not made his peace: “But I do not forgive and loose you, because you have not, in accordance with My commandment, begged forgiveness of those whom you had offended, or who have something against you.” And if such a one dares to take communion, he shall be judged and condemned.<br>  <br>  <br>  What should we do?<br>  <br>  <br>  Never come to confession without having made peace with everyone. It happens sometimes that our offenders are far away and if we went to them, we would not get back to church in time. In that case, make your peace with them mentally, but make a firm promise to yourself to go and see them as soon as you return home.<br>  <br>  <br>  What happens if the one with whom you are trying to make peace refuses to do so and says: “I do not forgive you”?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ask his forgiveness humbly, patiently but persistently. If even then he refuses to forgive you, may God be his judge, for in that case his own sins will not be forgiven. And you may tranquilly go to confession, since you have done all you possibly could to make peace.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another necessary requisite for a complete remission of sins is a full revelation of all one’s sins to the confessor during the confession, especially heavy sins, those which lie as a heavy stone on the penitent’s conscience. Do not be embarrassed to reveal your sins to a person who has sworn - under penalty of his own perdition - never to reveal anything which a penitent says to him in confession. Thus you will avoid shame before heaven and mankind on the Day of Judgment, because all the sins which you have confessed on earth will not be remembered there at all, having been erased by the mercy of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  As you come up to communion, this Chalice of Life, you must firmly believe that during the eucharistic canon, when the priest reads a special prayer in the altar and blesses the prepared prosphora and the red grape wine mixed with water in the chalice, at that moment they are transformed by the Holy Spirit into the Holy Gifts of the Body and Blood of Christ. Without faith in that this bread is the true Body of Christ and the wine is the true and precious Blood of Christ, - without such a firm and absolutely necessary faith it is better not to even approach the Chalice. There were cases, when for disbelief the Lord scorched the lips of the doubters (I have seen and heard live witnesses, who had personally received such a fearful lesson). It may be that the Lord will not scorch a doubter visibly, but that which has been taken without faith will, alas, only serve to judge and condemn the person.<br>  <br>  <br>  It is hard for people to accept this mystery. It is a Sacrament and to many seems strange. “How can he give us his body to eat,” some said even way back, when Christ first explained this Sacrament to the people. And many of them left Him at that time and did not follow Him. Thus the Lord showed that He does not force anyone to come to Him, that He is to be followed exclusively on a voluntary basis.<br>  <br>  <br>  And what did He say of His Holy Communion? “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whosoever eateth My Body, and drinketh My Blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day” (John 6:53-54).<br>  <br>  <br>  And now let us look at our sins in accordance with the words of the Holy Scriptures.<br>  <br>  <br>  Forgive us, Lord, first of all, that we do not instruct ourselves in the law of God day and night, that we do not like to hear or read the Lord’s exhortations, that pious conversations seem boring to us, that it is often hard for us to stand in church, where a multitude of God’s commandments are proclaimed and explained. This is the work of Satan, who envelops us in boredom and drowsiness during the reading of the Holy Scripture or the sermon, and we pander to him, often grumbling that the readings and the sermons are too long. We should be glad that God’s sermons are still being heard in churches, that the Lord has not yet deprived us of hearing the Word of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Repent before God and urge your somnolent souls to wake up and joyfully and attentively listen to every word of God, preserving it in your heart as did the Mother of God or the other blessed Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, in order to hear His word. And do not simply be cool and forgetful listeners, but those who love the words of the Lord, who fulfill them in life - not in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth (1 John 3:18).<br>  <br>  Do we believe in God absolutely, without any doubt? Whoever was shaken in his faith, allowed doubts to creep in, dwelt on blasphemous thoughts sent by Satan - repent and weep. Ask the Lord to forgive you for your lack of faith and to strengthen you in your belief. Pray as did the man of little faith described in the Gospel: “I believe, o Lord, help my disbelief” (Matt. 9:24). Doubts often arise, particularly among young people, because they listen to unbelievers. But unbelievers speak from their own point of view, deliberately passing over the other side of the coin, i.e. the arguments of believers and learned theologians against disbelief. You should know that believers have many rational grounds for their faith; but no matter how much one tries to prove the rationality of faith in God, to prove the existence of God - like two times two equals four - is impossible. God is a Being totally incomprehensible to us, and requires us to have faith in the greatest divine truths that have been revealed to us - firm, indubitable faith only. You must believe, for example, that the Holy Trinity consists of three persons: God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit; however, they are not three Gods, but One. This is hard to understand, but must be accepted on faith. However, the faithful are able to feel an inner presence of God, because He dwells within them. “Know ye not, says the Apostle, that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” (1 Cor. 3:16). Thus, for the one who lives in grace, the reasoning of the mind is no longer necessary. Such a person has an internal awareness that God exists, that God is with him. If you wish to have faith and attain salvation, try to achieve just such a belief. Our Orthodox faith is not some kind of teaching or philosophy, but life itself. God gave us His promise, and fulfills this promise upon true believers while they are still on earth: “I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people” (2 Cor. 6:16).<br>  <br>  <br>  Blessed is the one who believes in and confesses Christ! But repent those of you who have renounced Christ in some manner or other. In the early years of Christianity, hundreds and thousands of the faithful were martyred through all kinds of barbaric methods, but they did not renounce Christ. It is impossible even to describe the cruel and inhuman torture to which Christ’s followers were subjected by bloodthirsty Roman emperors and rulers. However, only a few martyrs renounced Christ, while the others stood firm in their faith despite indescribable tortures.<br>  <br>  <br>  And yet, as far as we are concerned, it is enough for a relative or an acquaintance to laugh and say something, and some of us already stop going to church. But remember the terrifying words of the Saviour: “But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven and before My angels” (Matt. 10:33). Ponder these words. God will not accept the one who has renounced Him, but will send him into eternal torment, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Who among us would ever willingly desire such a thing?<br>  <br>  <br>  But those who are firm in their faith, who are not embarrassed or afraid of anyone, who openly declare: “God exists! I am a believer!,” God will most certainly take unto Himself in accordance with His promise. Nowadays, those who openly cross themselves as they pass by a church, who attend |`|WNWKDw4uaa	You're doing it wrong.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Read John 20:verses21-23

You have to understand why those laws were given to only his chosen people. You also have to know that the world was and is still rule by Satan (until Armageddon) since the rebellion in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve chose Satan (an angel) to rule over them instead of the Almighty Jehovah God. The laws were to protect God's people from being snared from the lies of the wicked spirit like their forth father Adam. All other nations in those days were worshiping false gods (Satan and his bad angels). It was a protection for God's chosen people to have those laws so as to help them not get caught in promoting ungodly conducts among themselves. Isaiah 48:17-19 says, "This is what Jehovah has said, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel: “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit [yourself], the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.  O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.  And your offspring would become just like the sand, and the descendants from your inward parts like the grains of it. One’s name would not be cut off or be annihilated from before me.”<br>  <br>  Christians do not apply those laws anymore but they do apply the principles behind the laws. This way they can live their lives in harmony with God's requirements and promote Godly conducts. Since the first century and God's Word, the Bible, came to completion, God does not communicate to humans directly like he did in the days of ancient Israel. In modern days, the Bible serves as the communication between men and God through Christ Jesus the mediator. For God's Word is alive. "All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness,  that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work." (2Tim 3:16-17 Compare Psalm 19:7-10) Why? Hebrews 4:12 answers: "For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and [their] marrow, and [is] able to discern thoughts and intentions of [the] heart."<br>  <br>  If anyone is honest in his heart to seek God as to serve him, he will listen to God's Word, the Bible. And if that person needs assistant to help him understand God's Word, he will pray to God and God will send his servants to help that individual to come to accurate knowledge of him just like the Ethiopian Eunuch and Phillips. In the case of the Ethiopian Eunuch, the Bible didn't say that he prayed to God for understanding. But by his response to Phillips' question, he expressed that he needs to understand God's Word.

All of these are taken from the Old Testament, not the New Testament. Jesus put a stop to all of this when a woman was about to be stoned to death and he said "those who are without sin may cast the first stone". We are  no longer suppose to go by the guidelines of the Old Testament.

They were directed to the children of Israel for their own protection, that they should not be corrupted by the sinful influence of their pagan neighbors.<br>  <br>  As Jesus would later illustrate in the New Testament, sin is like yeast. When you mix a little into the dough, it affects the whole dough. When one of the Israelites sinned, it affected the entire city, tribe or nation.<br>  <br>  That was the Law back then. With Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, the Law still exists. The difference is that Jesus paid the  penalties for the sins of the entire world.

The old testament is full of people who sin and turn their backs on God to the point they will NOT return unless he performs miracles of deliverance or pours out wrath on them.  God is Just, meaning he hates evil and does not tolerate sin.<br>  <br>  Christ came to save, not to condemn, and in fact, it was Christ who said "he who is without sin, cast the first stone".  He obviously didn't put that woman to death for adultery, rather he told her to "Go and sin no more".  <br>  <br>  God is FULL of mercy and compassion.  Read all of the books, please don't just pull out certain passages to prove a point that you presume.  <br>  <br>  God is serious about sin, yes, and we are enemies of his until we turn to His Son, Jesus, and Repent of our sin.

I've been on it since having a hysterectomy at 35. I had terrible hot flushes and headaches at that time, and HRT fixed my problems straight away.

Wasn't a magic wand that made the symptoms disappear but after 6 months I suddenly realised how well I was. Excesive sweats etc were horrible but I could have put with these but it was the mood changes.I  was upsetting everyone and at the same time thinking I was right. I had been reluctant to go on it and after reading articles remember being so annoyed with my GP when I told him I was worried if going on it would increase the risk of Breast Cancer etc. His words were "Well, it may knock 10 yrs off your life but it's up to you. Do you want 20 good years or 30 bad ones?". However, I now realise it was the truest words every spoken. I came off it about 15 months ago as I was 58 and thought the time had came.  I previously was off it around 5 years before for 7 months but the symptoms gradually showed themelves until I was as bad as ever. This time after reading several articles I gradually weaned myself off HRT and have had no problems.  If you feel you are about to kill everyone around I would say definitely go for it. Remember the feeling of well being doesn't happen overnight though. Good Luck!|`|aCOJYTIVaa	I was about 20 years ago - however, no longer need it.

My gynecologist started me on Levothyroxine for the underactive thyroid--little change, then put me on a patch for estrogen and progesterone--almost immediately I began to have more energy, less bad moods, feel better overall, less achiness and joint pain.  However, I am still having some PMS symptoms and still tired--not quite as tired as before but not up to speed just yet either.  I did not have hot flashes, but had mood swings, extreme tiredness, depression, body aches, trouble sleeping, gastrointestinal problems--you name it, I had it.  Most of those seem to be related to the thyroid, but also the estrogen/progesterone.  <br>  <br>  The HRT seems to have made a big difference--oh, my face is less puffy too and less dry skin.  I am/was still having regular periods (but they were really heavy and really long)--the first since the HRT was long but not quite as heavy--waiting for the next one within the next few days---will just have to see.<br>  <br>  I am 51 (and 1/2)--had only skipped 2 periods in over 1 1/2 years, so wasn't in menopause supposedly, but with the thyroid problem too, its hard to know for sure. My family is very fertile and we usually don't go into menopause until around 55 or so.<br>  <br>  Only thing, before the HRT (with just the thryoid medication) my appetite decreased and I lost about 10 pounds (mostly bloating in my abdomen--I looked pregnant--still do, but less so).  After beginning the HRT, my appetite increased dramatically!!!  In addition, my sex drive has dropped--I had a very high sex drive before HRT, so ????|`|5sNOUCRKaa	I was on hormones for 25 years after hysterectomy even though my natural mom had died from cancer in female organs in was in the 60 s so I imagine the radiation really killed her.

The research that was done that showed an increase in breast cancer was flawed in that they tested it on women over the age of 75 or some such ridiculous age. <br>  <br>  The "researchers" are now taking a lot of flak from the medical community and so they should. They published a false report in order to gain prestige among the medical community by having a "published paper".  New research shows HRT is very safe for most women.<br>  <br>  Women should consider the effects of menopause on calcium loss, this causes oosteoporosisand even teeth decay, and loss.  HRT has been proven to reduce heart attacks and other medical conditions.<br>  <br>  If you are having problems with HRT I would suggest having the Dr prescribe a lower dosage. I have started on the lowest dosage.<br>  <br>  I consider it a "miracle" I am sleeping better, I dont wake up feeling tired. My skin has improved 200% and is no longer as dry as paper. It also looks healthier, I have more colour in my face. My skin has a more youthful appearance. <br>  <br>  Prior to taking it a sales clerk said to me "you're 65, you get the seniors discount dont you?"  Yesterday the SAME clerk said to me "you arent 55 yet are you?" <br>  <br>  My Fibromyalgia isnt as bad as it was, there has been no research done of FM and the aging process. however those of us with FM have found it does get worse as we age.<br>  <br>  I can move easier, dont wake up feeling like rigor mortis set in over night, any bad spells from overdoing dont last as long and are not as severe. I can do more in fact without suffering repurcussions of days of severe pain. <br>  <br>  I have more energy, the depression and crying spells are a thing of the past. My memory has improved, I am making better decisions, I dont feel so "scattered". I feel as if I have more "substance", Before taking it I felt "frail" and if I would "shatter" in a crisis, this change is very hard to put into words and describe. I no longer feel like a "little old lady".<br>  <br>  I am doing a lot more, I am happier, more positive, and a lot more even tempered. I feel 100% stronger and more capable.  My sense of humour has returned. I have taken charge of my life. I no longer feel "overwhelmed" by physical, mental and emotional demands and situations. I feel capable !! <br>  <br>  Before taking it I was skipping meals and had no interest in eating, now I am eating dinner every night and taking the time to cook for myself and enjoying it ! <br>  <br>  I am sleeping through the night wihout hot flashes and natural lubrication has returned so "that" part of my body is doing much better.<br>  <br>  You better believe its a "miracle". I cant imagine WHY women wouldnt take it if they are able to. Its not about "vanity", its about health, its about prevention of serious medical conditions, and its about YOU feeling better, stronger, having more energy and recovering the person you used to be !!!  Its about having a better life, for you and your family IMO

Most certainly you could dream of your dad, but beware your dad will not come bringing you news, and he will not be able to communicate with you.  The bible teaches us the dead cannot communicate.  (So no theoretically your dad will not come to your dreams with news of how he now is.  The dreams you can have of your dad are only of the memories you shared in life).

Obviously, the result is common ancestral features become dominant. After you've seen a few, you think you've seen them all. Of course a very discerning eye can tell them apart.<br>  <br>  Whites do look somewhat alike to the undiscerning eye, but they are easy to tell apart, generally due to their breeding diversity, they have different skin tones, different hair colors, different eye colors, different hair textures, different skeletal structure. You can even see evidence of such diversity amongst the members of a single family.<br>  <br>  Blacks, like Whites, do look somewhat alike to the undiscerning eye, but they are easily distinguishable, generally due to their breeding diversity they have different skin tones, different skeletal structure, different hair textures. These days even hair and eye color seems to figure a bit.<br>  <br>  That's my best theory right now, I could be wrong though.|`|k5izERYnaa	Most people think everyone from another race looks the same. <br>  For example, I was talking to my Asian friends a while ago and they said they can't really tell the difference between white people, and I can't tell the difference between Asians very well. I mean, I can tell the difference between someone who is Japanese and someone who is from Hong Kong or something, but if there's a lot of Asians together I will get totally confused (especially if they are speaking a foreign language)<br>  <br>  Also, it probably would have helped if you didn't pick only blonde hair/blue eyes white women - we come in way more varieties than Asians do (who are limited to dark hair and dark eyes)|`|AA11883252	Yes,|`|GPznIhzMaa	When I started at my current job, there were 6 white girls who all had the same-length brown hair and brown eyes.

If you agree that you have talent, and you agree that you can do that talent well, it's not wrong at all.<br>  There's a difference between saying that you're better than God, and saying that you can draw fairly well.<br>  Saying you're better than God, is like saying you're the best person in the world and you can do absolutely anything, but in my opinion, no one can be better than God because he created us. <br>  Saying you can draw fairly well and thanking God for it, isn't saying that you're better than God, it's saying you have a God-given talent, and you are proud of it as you should be.<br>  Carry on drawing and with your future that you want, and carry on thanking God for your talent. He gave it to you for a reason, so use it.|`|x6I3IEOBaa	IN general the answer is NO, in islam you can draw its considered a beautiful talent and muslim mosques are a true evidence of the beauty of art. But there is one thing, you shouldn't draw things like live humans and things that people workship, because by drawing someone you have associated a living thing with a picture and people will associate a creature of God to your creation which is like associating partners, so thats the only restriction otherwise you can draw wat you want.|`|AA10585123	I do not think it is a sin, you know everything in Islam is judged according to your intention, and obviously your intentions are harmless and so i think it's ok to draw, and it's ok to do it as a career not only as a hobby <br>  <br>  wish you the best with your|`|DhffKJreaa	As salama alaikum. <br>  <br>  Go ask the Imam of your mosque for a more detailed answer.

VAI6MtPIaa	You can simply say that you are not interested in those sort of things if you want to keep it out of the workplace. I don't think that anyone would be offended if you said that you can't do it because you prefer not to due to your religion. <br>  <br>  As a Christian, I have always been told that before doing something I should ask God if I should do it then ask that if by doing it will it cause others in my faith to stumble. I am not allowed to drink alcohol but it's not a sin. God simply doesn't want me to and I'm okay with that.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Being Christian is not why you don't drink alcohol or read horoscopes.  Those are individual decisions that aren't exclusive to, nor universal in Christianity.  Explain each issue as it comes and don't act as if it's related to Christianity, because it really isn't.<br>  <br>  It's very difficult for someone to talk about being Christian without sounding rude, seeing as most Christians believe that everyone else deserves to go to hell.  Tends to put people off, you know?  A good litmus as to whether or not you'll end up being rude is to think of how you would treat someone if they talked about THEIR religion and you started to dislike them or treat them bad.  If you had a co-worker who mentioned they were Atheist, Pagan, Voodoo, or some other belief system Christians generally loathe, would you be able to treat them with respect?  For a lot of Christians the answer is "no way."  As a Pagan and bi person, I was treated badly in the office by Christians.  So just remember that what's good for the goose is good for the gander. if you can't stand to hear about other beliefs, keep your own to yourself.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	I don't think it's wrong to tell someone your religion. I don't think most people would find this rude.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Why do you have to convey you're Christian to explain?  How about "it's just not my cup of tea"?  <br>  <br>  Everyone has different personal tastes. You're talking about a couple of things here that may or may not have anything to do with one's religious beliefs, so you need not throw religion into the mix - which is better left out of the workplace anyway.<br>  <br>  It doesn't really make any more sense to say "I'm a Christian" to explain your distaste for alcohol as it does my non-Christian coworker to explain why he doesn't drink "I'm not Christian, so I don't like alcohol" - that doesn't really make sense.  But there it is, there are some non-Christians who don't drink, even socially, as well as there are some Christians who do drink.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Just tell them that you are a Christian and leave it be. If they try to force the subject and are one of those that would like to make you stop believing in God, tell them that you are uncomfortable discussing religion in the workplace.

I've been out with people who were drinking and noticed that I wasn't. I've been asked to go out drinking with coworkers as well. I am proud to be a Christian. I'm never pushy or disrespectful, but I do tell them that I don't drink. When someone asks why, I tell them because I'm a Christian and choose not to.

If you handle each situation individually it comes across as  simply unappealing or inapplicable to your life but that you honor to each his own.<br>  <br>   It is unfortunate that it is the way it is but to many Christians have tainted the situation for you for being so intolerant. Hmmmmmm-let me rephrase that----people in general be it Atheist, Christian, Jews, Muslim.....etc have become so intolerant of those who differ and have tainted it. <br>  <br>  So keep up the good sensitive work that you do and continue to give Christianity a good name.|`|373KJjiOaa	Quite simple.

I take this into consideration, but always remain open since God can use whomever he wants. Then I go to God and pray about it and ask him to show me if it truly is a word from him. There have been a few occasions where the word took me by surprise, but in most cases when it was a true word from God it was only confirmation of what He had already been speaking to me.

I stopped complaining since that day and everyday I thank God for what I have .|`|aBCVFc3Kaa	yes he sent down a drunken angel who said that he'd got demoted and i was his replacement. i turned down the offer as i was young and didn't want to commit myself. also the idea of dying and going to heaven didn't really appeal to me.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	No, and it would be sheer pride to think a supreme being would specifically send you a message instead of saving starving children in Africa or stopping the genocides being committed in the world.|`|TFj6Z9Usaa	my youth group instructer said<br>   "someone in this room. is hurting. i dont know who it is or why. but they are hurting and they hear me out."<br>  and that night he was talking about me he didnt know it. but i did.|`|AA10578005	Yes but I wasn't the only one the message was for many times we think that we are the only ones going through something but that is soo not true He is awesome to affirm that it is from Him|`|483a6c92920a69c48f6085fae23a4618aa	No God, sent me anyone.<br>  The Cycle of rebirth sent Siddhartha Gautama Buddha with not just a message, but a life system, a teaching to get us free from suffering.|`|bSjbVxO2aa	I believe He has. <br>  <br>  I chose to listen and let God take care of it.|`|4JhcHJikaa	not that i know of? what kind of message would he send?|`|282f3c3ef67f759a8388216dc595a9dbaa	yeah to my priest it just said STOP!|`|ZFCCabZjaa	yea but noone was home to sign for it so I never got it :(|`|CIWd3vJIaa	Yes!!!!!<br>  It happened  when I was younger and usually when I was going through a rebellious stage.

I thank Him for that everyday.<br>  <br>  As I got older, it still happens, but not as frequent.<br>  <br>  <br>  A few years back, I had set my mind on something.  This lady came to visit our church and she got up to testify and said, you think that this is what you are going to do, well God says "no" you listen to my voice and I will be your God.  You disobey and say "yes" you are on your own.   It got my attention, and I know it was the Lord speaking to me through her.    I obeyed, although I did not want it that way.|`|OKClYfDQaa	Yes. Amen.

4SF4KGu4aa	The problem isn't so much how many watts but what will you be running at one time.<br>  <br>  I have a 5500 watt generator and a transfer box that has 6 lines/circuits on it. Window air conditioners likely will pull a bit of power but if it isnt running the same time as the freezer kicks in and the refrig., you'll be ok.<br>  <br>  Start up on most appliances use more initially. My unit will run all the lights and outlets, as well as the sump pump, furnace blower and indoor refrig and microwave. Unfortunately, the furnace blower, microwave, and refrig are on the same circuit so if those units kick in at the same time, it will likely open a breaker. I can take care of the problem by moving the microwave to another circuit. <br>  <br>  Since we are talking emergency up to 2 weeks, I'd make sure there was a transfer box installed so power wouldnt feed back into the house when the power is restored. Electrical company employees do not like to see generators running because they could get fried. I would also try to run the items only about 45 minutes and then shut items off for an hour or two. This will keep your fuel from being used up too quick.<br>  <br>  5 gallons basically will only last about 8 hrs on 50 percent load, maybe a little more. I'd speak with an electrician for sure and he will give you better ideas. My set-up cost about 1100 dollars 8-10 years ago but that included an electrician installing a transfer box.<br>  <br>  Wish you luck on this project. It is worth it and people in need will appreciate it, if you are willing to help others out.|`|AA11017231	There are too many variants to really be able to tell you. You need to look at the tags on all the appliances, etc. that you might want to be running all at the same time, find out what they each draw for power even during initial start up(electric motors draw more power during initial start up than they do while running), and then take all that information with you or call Lows or somewhere. They will be able to figure what you need.|`|SwIOyL0laa	And don't forget to fill up extra gas gans before the prices skyrocket and the lines at the pumps are around the block.  Fill them up as soon as you get the gennies in.  You can add Sta-bil to preserve the gas.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I think you will buy two, I know people who have generators, and they run their ice box and a light on one generator. Talk to the people at the home store and see if they can advise you.|`|X3Lp0ewMaa	Good question I was wondering the same thing? We are going to buy one also. After no power during Ike we want one. Food spoilage was the big issue.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	If you purchase your Generator from a good reputable dealer he should have that answer.|`|049a5ee66231db2295d9daeba62a36bcaa	Call Lowes and Home Depot, they will be glad to help you figure it out.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Look at the power requirements of every electrically powered item that you intend to use during a time that public power supply will not be available. Notice that the items that use a lot of power may not be a necessity. Electric clothes dryers, toasters, electric cook stoves, electric heaters and other high end users of electricity should be avoided. Add the watts required for the operation of each unit that is a necessity. You will not ordinarily operate all of the units on your list at the same time.<br>    Your local electricity provider can assist you with a reasonable estimate.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	since i life in the eye of the storm for over 25 years in louisiana i always used this theory == have a big cook out when the storm enters the gulf drink all the beer in the fridge and than pack and haul butt!!!  but if you insist i would go with at  10000 watts and have and automatic kick in installed -- you will have to test and service  the generator monthly to keep it in running order!!!|`|ehnxg6Utaa	ask  some body at Home Depot or Lowe's.  I have a 6500 watt generator and I run my sump pump, freezer, refrigerator, TV and a light.  We don't have an air conditioner, so you might need a bigger one|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Go with a 10,000 watt unit. It will use less gas per watt than 2 -5,000 watt units. Buy you're gas before you anticipate outage. Stored gas can go bad within a month. The window AC will use most of the wattage.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	No, but I do know enough to say THAT will be a lot.  Lights, television = no problem. But when you talk about a freezer, A/C, refrigerator all on ONE generator ? Whew ! that's a LOT !|`|09affeac55dbe7c8b68c339feb29879faa	go by wattage.  Usually nothing less then 5000 watts to support your major appliances and lights.  Have to get electrician to set it up to have only those using the generator.

And there is a sizable Japanese population in Brazil due to Brazil requiring cheap labor back when Japan was still a feudal society and Brazil was a developing country, plus there are quite a number of Brazilian restaurants in Tokyo.So there is a shared history there - some Japanese are aware of this, others are not. However, they don't often understand the idea of someone being Mexican-American or Spanish-American for example.  But to say the Japanese don't know what Latinos are is just ridiculous. I'm Latin, many of my students knew I was Latin, some didn't. However, they can't often distinguish someone from America v. the UK v. France for example and if you are light complected they may just assume you are white. That happened a lot with me. Or if you are dark complected they may assume you are black. <br>  <br>  I would say generally speaking they are happy if you visit their country and spend your money.

All you can do is walk around hoping that all the good things weren't part of a dream|`|lrZXMy6Kaa	oh my god if this is heaven then i'm screwed i just got done talking to my mom about something like that. i hope when i die heaven is as good as we make it sound to be. we have so many problems right now that im just hoping when my time comes it means that all my struggles and suffering ends.|`|4JhcHJikaa	youll never know|`|AA10351261	If we are dead then what's up with the people in the cemetery and the people that will die today?  Are they dead then dead again?<br>  No, this ain't Heaven. Not by a long shot.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	There are theories very similar to yours that attract a lot of researchers.<br>  <br>  I believe that this "reality" is mere illusion.|`|b8528620a728305f71cb5c62336e1efbaa	I've often thought about this. It's such an interesting concept :D. Haha I'll give it a go but I'll try to make it very simple. :P<br>  <br>  Well we define dreams differently so we cannot be in a dream state. A dream is our log into our subconscious. In dreams there is no reality. For example, in dreams you would often not have 5 fingers. Or when you look at the clock twice the time would have significantly lapsed from the last or be completely different. I've tried to lucid dream ~ being aware of your dreams ~ by practicing these things and it has worked, I remembered my dreams more so it has to be true that in our dreams we don't have a reality. Since the time is moving constantly for us, we cannot be dreaming. <br>  <br>  Are we dead? Well that depends. What is your definition of heaven? Do you believe in heaven? Or an afterlife at all? Most people picture heaven as being all easy and pure and smooth and tranquil, etc.. Well in our world -- lots of people have a hard time right now. Lots of people are falling for suicide.... Many more are developing mental illnesses and diseases from stress and so on. I don't know how to put it. My point is that, the word 'heaven' has different meanings to different people. Lots of people don't see suffering in the word heaven, so can this be heaven? I don't know. What do you think? I don't think it is. But that's my view.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	you need to stay out of the medicine cabinet for one. and two stop reading that book its creating a mess of innocent logic.<br>  <br>  the dream was telling you that we never stop thinking even in a sleep state of mind.|`|kp3JRi72aa	This is definitely not heaven.  Heaven has no sin, it's perfect.  The human mind can not even comprehend it.  And this is not a dream.  The dead know nothing.

af8ee084de3cee54cfbb090a7fba866daa	My freshman year at USC I took a general biology class and was pleased when the professor took an entire lecture to say basically, "if you don't believe in evolution because of your religion I won't challenge you on it, but here are the reasons why in this class you must know and understand the theory of evolution, and prove your understanding on tests.  Basically, nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution."  She then went on to discuss all the major myths about evolution spread by fundamentalist religions, and went on to debunk them with scientific fact.<br>  <br>  The reason I mention this lecture is as follows: Religion has no place in science, and science has no place in religion.  My teacher took an entire lecture to make this point clear: your religion is fine, but any beliefs that try to go against scientific study are not welcome in this room.  <br>  <br>  To say that we should try to force churches to teach science (even in this kind of trolling, loaded question) is just to lower yourself to the same level they're at when they try to insinuate their religion into public education.  Taking the high road is almost always better.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Good point.  Never gonna happen, but good point.|`|EepiLrmZaa	it would never work.|`|G02cCLXJaa	Good luck.

We are ordained by action of the Holy Spirit to proclaim the gospel.

But that's the nature of belief, and the nature of church. We have to expect that, when going to church, we might not always be exposed to facts.<br>  <br>  I think that what is taught in schools should be regulated, and what is taught in church should be whatever they want to teach. They're not a government organisation, after all.<br>  <br>  As for religion in science classes - certainly not! There should be religion in R.E classes, and science in science classes.

So what is your problem again?|`|NaM4ZT64aa	"I do not agree with a word you say, but I shall defend to the death your right to say it."-Voltaire.<br>  <br>  How about simply defining the term "scientific theory" so the foolishness of the statement "only a theory" can be seen by those even without a formal scientific education.|`|tuULGJS6aa	That sounds okay to an extent, but I'm not sure that I'd call any gods even hypotheses. They're just primitive myths with no trappings of science about them. If creationists want their ideas taught along with evolution, then evolution should be taught in churches too. Fair is fair. The First Amendment forbids a state religion, so if anyone wants a god mentioned in some classes, not science though, equal time must be given to Marduk the Babylonian creator, Brahma the Hindu creator, Allah the Muslim creator, Pan Ku the Chinese creator, etc.
kGpicOQhaa	''Can anyone please explain what this exactly is?''<br>  Well in a simple way one can just say it was a change of the type of government. From monarchy to Islamic Republic. But it also marked a milestone in Politics. It was, for the first time after hundreds of years a revolution where people demanded the entry of religion into politics and not the opposite. <br>  <br>  Why did it happen? <br>  As an Iranian, the answer for this question is very obvious for me: the people wanted to. But why? Iran was a monarchy for 2500 years, why change? <br>  <br>  Well one the main reasons was that the Pahlavi regime (1925-1979), was the first dynasty to actively start banning religious activities and customs. Banning the Hijab was one example. The ''westernization'' of Iran was also a factor which enraged the people. Even semi-pornographic films had started being shown in the cinemas. There was once a period where people would say that skirts in Tehran were shorter than ones in Paris.<br>  <br>  Another reason was our dependence on western states to run practically everything in the nation. The military was completely ''Made in America'' and ''Made in Israel'' (i.e. Israeli origin Uzi guns are still used in the Iranian military). Our oil industry and many other industries were not completely in our own hands. Most importantly, our true capital was in Washington DC rather than Tehran. What I mean by that is that most important political decisions were taken respecting the interests of the countries we were dependant to, mainly the USA. Our lifeline was attached to the USA and we couldn't afford getting it cut.<br>  <br>  Political corruption was also a factor, but not a big one. One thing which also infuriated the population was SAVAK. This notorious intelligence agency was responsible for the death and torture of many political prisoners. Keep in mind that a political prisoner could simply be someone who was hiding and spreading speeches of ayatollah Khomeini. My very own grandfather had his toe nails pulled out.<br>  <br>  The Iranian people wanted to run their own country, using their own ways and respecting their own values, not foreign ones. <br>  <br>  I think it is very easy for you to guess now why the West was not happy of this revolution.|`|OCg8zOH2aa	i don't know much .. but i think this is what happened ..<br>  Iran was Muslim dominant i.e the Ahl as Sunnah wal Jamat. The Shits stayed under the radar and formed a strong brotherhood. You see no Muslims really like the shits as they are vile animals and they do strange things like self flagellation and other unpleasant acts they commit in the name of "Islam". Finally when they were strong enough they over threw the Muslim rule and formed their so called "Islamic Government"|`|e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,<br>  <br>  this is a veyr very big topic........<br>  ......but here is a very very brif info<br>  <br>  <br>  well, shah (the king) had a great relationship with the americans and the west such as UK........<br>  .....Iran's oil paid for a lot of the american and UK expenses<br>  <br>  so when AyatoAllah Khomeini (ra) started the revolution......<br>  ........Shah couldn't fight back (or didn't want to fight back) and left Iran<br>  <br>  <br>  and since then......<br>  .....the relationship between Iran and the west had been................not so good<br>  <br>  <br>  it was just a while (a few days) after the revolution that some youngsters went to the american embassy and took the americans as hostages......<br>  ........the negotiations to release the hostages didn't go so well<br>  <br>  so americans decided to send some of their special forces on a mission........<br>  ........and bring back the hostages by force as talks didn't do anything<br>  <br>  so americans calculated everything........<br>  ........and went on the mission wisely<br>  <br>  the took about 3-5 choppers.........<br>  .......and the were flying so low so they couldn't be spotted by the radars<br>  the hostages were in Tehran (the capital city), so they landed in a desert not too far away from Tehran to get things sorted and then attack......<br>  <br>  they were not there to start a war......<br>  ........just to rescue their people and get out of the country<br>  <br>  so when they wanted to take off again and go for the attack........<br>  ........there was a massive  storm, which cussed some of the choppers to clash into each other<br>  some of them died.........<br>  ......and a few of their choppers broke down/exploded<br>  <br>  the whole idea of the mission was to take ALL the hostages back......<br>  .......and since this happened, they had to pull back and call off the mission<br>  <br>  and the Iranians didn't know about this till the american president announced this on national television.......<br>  <br>  so then Iranians went to that desert and found a few choppers......<br>  <br>  so many people believe it was something like "al-Fil" were ALLAH SWT defeated the enemies......<br>  ,,,,,,,,,(like the story of chapter 105)<br>  <br>  and just after the revolution.......<br>  ........sadam used the opportunity to attack Iran<br>  in this war, A LOT of countries helped Iraq by providing weapons and war equipments...... <br>  .....but Iran fought 8 years with the equipments that Shah had left behind<br>  i've also heard that they bought some too........<br>  .........but they had to pay A LOT for them<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  so yeah, as i said this was a very very brief info about this........<br>  .........as this is a very big topic<br>  <br>  hope i helped..........<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|WmU7jhObaa	@Omar<br>  did he really say that? not surprised|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	Regarding Khomeini and his "revolution"...<br>  <br>  1) There was nothing Islamic with regards to Khomeini's revolution.

355JLlcLaa	It's highly unlikely that the writer of the Adam and Eve story in Genesis thought that the serpent in Eden was Satan. The Book of Job describes Satan as one of "the sons of God", and he operates under God's orders.<br>  <br>  It isn't until Revelation that John identifies the great dragon - derived by the Jews from Babylonian myth, perhaps Tiamat - with both the Eden serpent and Satan. This is an example of the Theological practice of "reading back" later beliefs into earlier scripture, so interpreting it in a way that the original writer or prophet couldn't have meant. They were all originally separate myths. <br>  <br>  So, it wasn't Satan who peddled dope, it was the serpent. And the dope was derived from magic trees, explained by the following:<br>  <br>  The first man and the first woman live in a state of primaeval leisure and innocence in the garden of Eden until, tempted by the serpent, they eat the fruit of the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in defiance of God's wishes. It was one of two trees in the garden, the other being the "tree of life".<br>  <br>  These trees are thought to represent two originally separate traditions which the biblical author has brought together to express his view of the origin of the human condition. The first tree belongs to a distinctly Israelite tradition. The "knowledge of good and evil" probably means the capacity for rational and ethical judgement. This attribute belongs supremely to God, who forbids humans to acquire it. After the first human pair has defied his command, God condemns them and their descendants to a life of toil and pain. <br>  <br>  He drives them from the garden in order to deny them the fruit of the tree of life, which would bestow the other divine attribute, eternal life (Genesis 3:22-24). Thus humans are like God in one respect but, unlike him, they die. In this distinction lies the vast potential but also the limitation of human existence.<br>  <br>  A sacred tree that confers eternal life occurs in many mythologies and is common in Near Eastern iconography. Numerous myths of the region explain that humanity is mortal because one person failed to eat a magical food that would have made them live forever (one example is found in the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh). But the story in Genesis is alone in stressing that humans continue to suffer death as a direct consequence of their disobedience to God's command.|`|LUiiAlsJaa	the christian God Satan is only fiction|`|v80N4JB0aa	Satan is a christian God, and christian gods are not real
da4zS4AOaa	Oh my gosh. We share the same opinions. I moved her in America. I've never had a boyfriend before because I'm very picky. I've been approached by 3 guys who were all black. One of them wears these saggy pants, One of them is tall like a basketball player and speaks slang. The other one was just not attractive and was ghetto. I don't find them attractive at all based on the three things I mentioned. They shouldn't even bother approaching me if they contain ghettoness, baggy pants, speak slang language which I have heard time understanding even after living in U.S for 5 freaking years.<br>  My parents even won't let me bring a black person with those characters (I have common sense not to bring one anyways.

jcK6EXpiaa	I am part native american, and part white. YES, my native family has been subject to Genocide. Proof of that is in the Library of Congress, in your own history books (though its written off as battles between native americans and settlers rather than massacres) as well as in the museum where I work. My non-native family, from Newfoundland, took part in a documentary about the founding of Newfoundland (an Island province in canada) and a story about how some of my great great grandparents ahnialated an entire village was told in it. Native americans and Native canadians are similar people, just as the Irish and Scootish are similar (yet different) our boundaries pre-columbus were much different than the two boarders that trisect north america today. And its highly doubtful that you'll hear of these things from your grandparents, most of them either had no idea that the us government was doing this, or they were raised to believe native americans deserved it. There is soooo much I could type on this subject, but I am at work and don't really have the time. Instead, I invite you to research the definitions of Genocide (wikipedia has this) then research the Allotment Act, the Indian Removal act, the massacre of Wounded knee, The Boarding School era for Native American Children, March Point (this talks about the deliberate pollution placed on native american reservations in a direct attempt to poison us, the Bush administration supported this) The trail of tears, Treaty Rights, and the Buero Of Indian Affairs (under the U.S. war department, now known as the department of the interior) <br>  <br>  The massacre continues to this day. As we speak, children on the navajo reservation are being exposed to toxic chemicals planted on their reservation by the U.S. military. Many of them are born with severe birth defects, or die in their mothers wombs before they get a chance to live. As we speak, not 80 miles from where I sit, an oil refinery pollutes the lungs of the Lummi and Swinomish people, causing hundreds of cases of cancer and diseases. Last month, the Kitsap County Toxic Waste Disposal department droped 60 bags of god knows what near the water system of one of our tribal neighborhoods. Non of the news papers would print the story, and our council had to pay to have a hazard crew remove the stuff.<br>  <br>  EDIT: for those of you who think you have nothing to do with this continued repression and genocide, remember that the continuous repression of my people is what keeps you in this country. You don't belong here. I don't care if you were born here or not. I don't care if your ancestors were brought against your will. You still steal and depleat our natural resources, pollute our homes, make fun of our religions and cultures, or just simply ignore our plight.

I'm having a hard time believing you really asked this question.  The Native Americans were the first slaves used (and as in all societies, other NA's usually sold their own slaves to the whites in the first place) but they were extremely susceptible to smallpox and millions of them died in the western hemisphere before they even saw a white man themselves, the smallpox moved so fast.  When they needed more slaves and there weren't enough of the original people to go around, they started importing people from Africa.<br>  <br>  Also, check out "Tales of the Trade, Slavery in the Deep North", a documentary put together by the descendants of the biggest pre-Revolutionary war slave importer.  They mention one town meeting document from their ancestor's home base in Bristol, RI, where a shopkeeper is requesting that they move the slave whipping post because they kept getting blood spatters on his storefront.  <br>  <br>  Slaves were not only beaten, but regularly branded or had feet or hands amputated as punishment.  It was not a rare exception for these things to happen.  The babies were sold away from their mothers all the time.  Some people are known NOT to have allowed their slaves to be beaten, because they were in the slave-market business and wouldn't get good prices for a scarred or crippled slave.<br>  <br>  Slavery in all its forms, including serfdom in feudal Europe, could only be kept up by dehumanization and cruelty.  No one was just going to sit there and take it unless they were made to be afraid, and sometimes, they still didn't just take it.|`|C9QQPROkaa	A little history lesson the native americans were massacred not only because outsiders wanted this land but because they could not control nor keep them alive long enough to make them slaves.

Because the Bible gives us Adams age when he first had a son.  Then they trace the lineage to Jesus.  From Adam to Jesus it's about 4000 years.  Jesus to now is 2000.  That equals 6000.  The big question is when did Adam start aging?  Did he start againg after the fall or while he was in the garden?  If he aged while he was in the garden then the earth is about 6000 years old.  If he didn't age until the fall then we don't know how long he spent in the garden and we wouldn't know how old the earth is.|`|AA12194228	These are all good answers, mostly.

I just had this argument today. <br>  I believe the bible is not meant to be taken literally but rather interpreted. It provokes a vast degree of imagery which should not be interpreted as literal meanings. <br>  <br>  I attend a Catholic High School and have taken an extra year to do sports before university, so I had a discussion with several "old School" Catholic girls in grade 12. Let me say that i am no "old school hardcore Chatholic" but I always held a middle ground basing my belifs on interprated bilical accounts and scienticf proof. Actually today was the first day i've ever heard about a 6000 year old earth concept. It very much surprised me. I was intriuged and listend to their side of the story, in which they attempted to disprove radio cabon dating and fossilized remians. However I asked them if we take into account the bibles teachings that the earth was flat and the sky revolved around earth above our heads, should this be taken literalyy as well?<br>  <br>  One girl piped in and siad how can we be sure the earth is not flat? I asked her have you ever flown in a plane and seen the earths curvature, or sene a live television feed from the space station? Tell me the earth is surley not round? That is if we take the bible word for word. It is also of note that during the scientific revolution and the reformation of the 15th century the Catholic Church "adjusted" it's teachings to adapt to new scientific evidence.<br>  <br>  In defence some of their points made sense and i had little to say to some of their points. A very intersting discussion but neither side would give up. Though I hate when no one has any facts and asks me if my uncle is an ape, and why we don't have "tails" anymore "because they would be so usefull"  Random  jabber does not make for a good discussion in turn it just angers both sides.<br>  <br>  Interesting concept|`|2e34ws6zaa	Some Christians hold to a 'Young Earth Theory,' in which the claim is made that the earth is no older than six to eight thousand years.  The number of years is derived from the estimated length of each generation recorded in the Bible.  From the number of generations and when one counts the lineage of Jesus back to King David and King David back through Adam, they deduce that Adam was created no more than 6,000-8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Not an answer as to whether or not it's right, just so you know why they believe such.  :)|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Only Young Earth Creationists.

Perhaps Bible codes are the next level of understanding that God has in store for us and we are just now starting to scratch the surface of it.

2k8rFUOiaa	Here's the Catholic Church's view:<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church bases its teachings of morality on St. Thomas Aquinas' 'Natural Law' theory. One of the primary precepts of Natural Law is to 'protect and preserve life' - primary precepts are universally binding and cannot be broken under any circumstances.<br>  <br>  However, there is a loophole in Natural Law called the 'doctrine of double effect', where a primary precept can be broken if it is an unintentional side effect of an action. For example, in the case of euthanasia: if a doctor administers a large dose of morphine to a patient with the intention of relieving their pain, knowing full well that the dose of morphine will kill the patient - provided that killing them is not the doctor's intention but is an unavoidable side effect of relieving their pain, then administering the pain killer is a morally right action according to Natural Law and the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Double effect is the only time where euthanasia (passive euthanasia) is permitted under Natural Law. In any other circumstances, it is seen as morally wrong and forbidden.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|1evqSw67aa	As God created life and christianity tells us that we must not kill or desecrate a life<br>  abortion is considered Murder and the same goes for euthanasia<br>  we must not kill what God has created<br>  <br>  <br>  hope that makes sense|`|35BLOIgOaa	there is no religion<br>  to my knowledge but there might be a few sect's around kamikaze's  is that Bushido? suicide bomber's the assassins[Muslim's] you see<br>  euthanasia is a Pretty new word in the dictionary actually there was three new word's that came out of the second world war holocaust<br>  Quisling and your WORD so to be included in your Context I think it's a wee bit wide of the mark don't you think the hebrew word for Holocaust is ?[shoa  shola] quisling basically traitor and we all think we now what yours stands for|`|qGVBxZZOaa	I don't get your question.

vuRejUo3aa	Where did you find a relation between "wealth" & "religion"? If you are a truly religious person, you were supposed to believe that the God gave you the scope to earn that wealth. Now question remains: Did you honestly earned that wealth? (I believe, no one can be rich without depriving others). Do you share your wealth with the poor as per your ability? When the answers are yes, then it's all right with wealth & religion. Please do not forget my belief: No one can be richer without depriving others someway. <br>  p.s. By the way, what did you mean by wealth? How much amount or assets would you count as being "wealthy"? I know a wealthy, religious person who's a simple farmer & who has a pair of bulls/cows, a two-rooms house made of tins & wood, two beautiful kids, a loving wife & enough land to cultivate crops that allow him & his family food throughout the years! Isn't he a wealthy guy? Can't he be religious?|`|XiITTg3waa	BEING WEALTHY ,, MATERIALLY SPEAKING,, ONLY COUNTS IN THIS WORLD ,,,<br>  <br>   COUNTLESS PEOPLE ARE RELIGIOUS ,,WHICH ONLY COUNTS IN THIS WORLD !!<br>  <br>   WHAT MATTERS IS ,,IF WE KNOW THE ONE TRUTH ,,JESUS CHRIST ,, THE WAY ,,TRUTH AND LIFE !!!!<br>  <br>   MOST WEALTHY PEOPLE WILL NOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD !!!!!!!|`|8pQrIL90aa	I like AW tozers lifestyle as it is testified of in a mini biography.

Sure we can have nice things, but to live in excess, well, it isn't much or a role model for humility.|`|AA11536715	It depends on the religion.

I mean that God is lord of your finances, and you acknowledge that the money is all His anyways, and he can use it however he wants!! And then, not only understanding this, but following through with it... that's the only way to be wealthy AND to follow God!!|`|lkJ1M01Uaa	Christianity teaches to share wealth, not just to accumulate it.

Take a look all around today. You will found many churches who preach on money and say that if you don't give you will be cursed. You see pastors taking the churches money to buy themselves airplanes, mansions, expensive clothes and jewelry, and they have a heap of material things that cost lots of money. Take for example (and this isn't to make anyone mad or to talk bad about this person but truth is truth) Benny Hinn and Creflo Dollar. They both take the churches money and spend it on themselves and their families buying useless stuff. A news channel did a report on them and found that Benny Hinn was taking him and his family out to eat and spending 5,000 on food and going to hotels that were like 10,000 a night. Why? God does want to see His children prosper but it doesn't mean we can be foolish with the money we are given. It is unwise to spend money on a hotel that is 10,000 a night when you can get a hotel that is $100 a night and then you can use the rest of the money helping others and doing good things with it. Is it a sin to be wealthy? I don't think so but most people who are rich aren't truly in a relationship with Christ, they might look and sound like a christian but really they are just religious and Jesus was against religious people back when He walked on the earth. Even Jesus said it is more easier for a camel to go through an eye of a needle then for a rich man to go to heaven. Why? Because MOST, not all, people who became rich begin to take their eyes off of Jesus and they begin looking at the things of the world and we all that when we love the world and the lust that comes with it, then we do not have the love of the Father in us. Can someone truly be saved and rich? I think yes it is possible with God's help and if they had a true love for Him in the beginning, but for MOST  people I say no cause the love of money sets in and that is the root of all evil and they begin to forget God. Money will take a person away from trusting in Jesus and instead trusting in their money and their self. A rich man in the bible came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?" Jesus told him he must keep the commandments. The man asked which ones. Jesus answered and told him some commandments and the man responded by saying he kept and obeyed all those commandments and what else must he do. Jesus then replied and said, "Go sell all your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in Heaven, then come follow me." When the rich man heard this he walked away very sad for he owned a lot of things. Jesus said to His disciples that it is very hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. This rich man walked away sad cause he loved the things of the world more then he loved God. We can be rich and saved but how do we spend our money? Are we allowing that money to take God's place? Are we being good stewards over what God gave us or are we being foolish with it? Are we letting it consume us with the lust of the world and the things therein? Again, most rich people will find it hard to get into heaven and those such as Benny Hinn, Rod Parsley, Creflo Dollar, and a lot of preachers on tv who beg for money, might sound and look saved but are only religious people who don't even truly serve or know God. The truth is, when you are truly saved you desire to give to those who need it, not beg to take from others and not spend it all selfishly on yourself!|`|zmab07Giaa	yes, however generally people that make a lot of money are educated, so religion is out of the question|`|fSL2hOuwaa	The more you have the more you can give to others so why not?

18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	Jesus went out of his way more than once for one person.  Take for instance the Woman at the Well....<br>  <br>  Read carefully...<br>  <br>  Text: John 4:1-39<br>  <br>  "When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. And and said he "must needs go through Samaria.")<br>  <br>  Did you catch that? Jesus said that He "must needs go through Samaria"<br>  <br>  The Bible does not say that Jesus wanted to go through Samaria.<br>  <br>  It does not say that Jesus thought it might be nice to go through Samaria. <br>  <br>  The Bible says that Jesus "MUST NEEDS GO through Samaria." <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus is traveling from Judaea to Galilee. Galilee is several miles north of Judaea. The established route between the two was to the east along the path of the Jordan River, which takes you straight to the Sea of Galilee. <br>  <br>  However, Jesus does not take the established route. Instead, He chooses to take a westerly route through Samaria. This is something that Jews just did not do. Jews are simply "too good" to travel through a "Gentile Dog" ghetto like Samaria. But Jesus "must needs go through Samaria." <br>  <br>  Why does Jesus go out of His way to take the always-avoided road through the land occupied by the despised Samaritans? Why is it that He "must needs go" this way? FOR ONE PERSON!<br>  <br>  Because Jesus knew that in Samaria there was a place called Jacob's<br>  Well. He "must needs" tell this lady that He is the Messiah, the Son of God so that she can believe on Him and be saved. <br>  <br>  Out of his way for ONE OF US.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Try looking up John 3:16<br>  <br>  3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Implies all through the Bible, hence <br>  God loves each of us as if there were only one of us.-- Saint Augustine|`|h6NUE6VTaa	the bibles that exist now aren't authentic,even though it doesn't say anything about the death of prophet jesus(pbuh)<br>  jesus didn't die on a cross,he is not the son of God,neither GOD himself.<br>  i believe in one true almighty GOD ,that HE and only HE can forgive us for committing sins <br>  <br>  they need to stop talking about that fiction story of a guy considered as GOD and his son in the same time was crucified by normal ppl to virtually save us|`|70OClBEQaa	it doesnt say....you can look in the Bibles bibliography or works sited page....does the bible have footnotes or something i dont remember him ever saying that "I will die for humanity" yeah he's fake everything is fake|`|p6wwiQG3aa	It doesn't.

We know that the world is more than one person, but if only one person trusted in Christ, Christ would have paid for that one.  However, knows that more than one would.  It is even much more than 144,000 as the jehovah witnesses say, at some point.  This statement is not in the Bible, but an inference from the above verse.

I find is ironic that the beam is so deep in some "Christian's" eyes that they find the mote in their neighbors.  <br>  <br>  I know that I am a Christian, same as Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, and so forth.  It is not up to me to say what I think that others  believe, rather bear witness of what I do - I won't speak for others, only my own beliefs.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Depends on who you ask.  To a Mormon - or member of the LDS Church, which is actually called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints - YES we are Christians.  If you ask a mainstream christian or fundamentalist christian or a few others - no they view us as an evil CULT. <br>  <br>  If you ask anyone who has a Mormon (LDS) friend or associate that knows a good LDS person who lives their faith & standards - they typically realize JUST what a good Christian truly is when they know one!  <br>  <br>  Ultimately of course, He who will judge us ALL will decide who has been  His disciple and follower and who has spent their time throwing around accusations, hate, lies, persecutions, and spewing unkind, unchristian like behavior in their lives and in their hearts..... I THINK THAT will ultimately determine who HE knows is a true follower of CHrist and thus, a CHRISTIAN in heart, in action, in deed, in thought, in word and in truth.|`|AA11923447	I am a Roman Catholic, and I accept my friends in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) as brothers and sisters in Christ. Some people bash Mormons because of their unique theology (a theology I don't share with them), but I have never met a Mormon who doesn't revere Jesus Christ. Instead of promoting division and discord by saying that they're not Christians, I accept them. There's nothing wrong with working together across theological lines. Also, Fundamentalists have told me again and again that as a Catholic, I'm not a "True Christian" (TM). I know how hurtful that pronouncement can be, so I refuse to go around labeling others in the same way.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	No it is not. <br>  <br>  Mormons are polytheists, Christians are monotheists.<br>  <br>  The Docrines of the Mormon Church deviate from Orthodox teachings (such as, Mormons reject the Doctrine of the Trinity, The Eternal States, (Heaven and Hell), The Atonement, The Deity of Christ and so forth).<br>  <br>  There is a major difference between a Trinity and a Triad. Christians believe in a Trinity, Mormons believe in a Triad.<br>  <br>  Mormons believe in gods and goddesses and that God was once a man who became Divine, and that mankind can progress to godhood, becoming gods themselves and that through obedience to the ordinaces of the Church, when one enters the Celestial Kingdom he or she may be granted a goddess wife and poplute his own planet. As they believe in the concept of Eternal Marriage. <br>  <br>  All of these beliefs are in contradiction to Scripture.  Firstly because no man can become a god, and this desire is what caused both satan to be cast out of heaven, and Adam & Eve to be thrown out of the Garden. It is the Original Sin: Pride and the desire to become "godlike". Satan desired to be worshiped as God and thus his condemnation. He then deceived Adam and Eve into sinning in the same way that he did, which was the desire to be godlike knowing the difference between good and evil. (Genesis 3:5).<br>  <br>  As the Bible States that there is no marriage or marrying in eternity, therefore no populating other planets. (Matthew 22:30; Mark 12:25; Luke 20:35).<br>  <br>  Mormons also believe that the Cross of Calvary is foolishness, and that the blood of Christ on the Cross only paid for (or made atonement for) the sins of Adam, which contradicts Romans ch5, Hebrews ch9, 1 Corinthians ch15 and 2 Corinthians ch11. <br>  <br>  There remains a plethora of other doctrines of the Church which conflict with the Orthodox teachings of Christianity. Mormons are not bad people, they are very moral but due to the Doctrines of the Church they are not Christians. Their doctrines are similar to that of the gnostics, with and emphasis on the Cerinthians; yet with hints of Arianism though the JWs are more Arian in their doctrines than the LDS. (Arius was a 3rd century heretic condemned by the Church.) <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps. xoxo ?<br>  <br>  *edit* LOL Hi mum4. Funny you should mention Doctrines since 300AD as i was just talking about that with someone. *grins*  I TUd you anyway.<br>  <br>  *edit* seanbaker: well that's akin to the pot calling the kettle black; JWs aren't christians either.<br>  <br>  *edit* Mum4 is correct in the sense of stating that Mormons believe that BoM is a restoration of the gospel. The only issue with that notion is that the "fullness of the gospel" did not need to be restored as it was never lost. Mormons believe that Jesus appeared to American Indians (that were descendants of the 12 Tribes of Israel, which is historically and genetically FALSE) but that he told them of a "new gospel" which is recorded in BoM.  Theophanies are limited to Scripture and Jesus would have no need to reappear centuries later preaching a different gospel than the one he told his 12 disciples. As upon the Ascension he gave to us His Holy Spirit. But this is the core of the LDS faith, hence also why they are not Christians. <br>  As mentioned they (most not all) are very moral people, but they are not Christians due to the Doctrines. Christians are monotheists, Mormons are Polytheists.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Every Christian denomination believes something a little different. Mormons are a Christian denomination. They believe Jesus Christ is the son of God, the savior of mankind, the redeemer, and the Lord Jehovah.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I'm Christian.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	You are getting to an age old question.  What is a Christian?<br>  <br>  Most people who call themselves a Christian believe in Jesus Christ as the son of God and the Savior of mankind.  <br>  <br>  That is about the only thing they have in common.  They have thousands of issues about how this works which drives them off to their separate "only true Christian faith" segments of belief and worship.  Each one will repudiate the others which are not part of the group.<br>  <br>  Most of them will try to drive out the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Seventh Day Adventists.  The fundamentalist radicals will curse at the Roman Catholic Church and call it the whore of Babylon.  Other sectors will call the Pentecostals a snake handling cult.  In the past the Roman Catholics had deemed the followers of Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation a bunch of lost souls damned for their heresy.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think a bunch of them are acting in a hypocritical manner where in one sentence they say it only takes an acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior to be saved and a Christian.  Then in the next sentence they go on to complain how the Mormons and anyone else who doesn't share the same faith traditions they do are heretics who deserve the hellfire they have coming.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	It really depends on how Christianity is defined.  If it requires a trinity, then LDS are not Christian.  If it requires faith that Jesus is the savior, and son of God, then yes.

Our beliefs are strange and different because we beleive that the powers and authority of heaven was lost from the Catholic church, even as early as 300 AD.  All off-shoots from that have varying degrees of error and many traditional Christian beleifs are diversions from the original teachings of Christ.<br>  <br>  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a restoration of those lost truths through modern-day prophecy and visitation of angels.  We are literally led by Jesus Christ, and every member has the gift of the Holy Ghost as a constant companion to guide and instruct us, provided we remain worthy by exercising faith in Christ and trying to obey His commandments.<br>  <br>  You could say that we are a not a part of modern Christianity, but since we do literally follow Christ, we are very much Christian.  P.S.  You are right about other Christians not accepting many of our beleifs.  But we are a very faith-filled people (or at least, many of us are - no-one's perfect!  We're all growing).

yiiMoXZLaa	Kill Sons of Sinners.  Make ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers; Lest they rise and posses the earth, and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants.  (Isaiah 14:21 NAB)<br>  God Will Kill Children.  The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird, for your children will die at birth or perish in the womb or never even be conceived.  Even if your children do survive to grow up, I will take them from you.  It will be a terrible day when I turn away and leave you alone.  I have watched Israel become as beautiful and pleasant as Tyre.  But now Israel will bring out her children to be slaughtered."  O LORD, what should I request for your people?  I will ask for wombs that don't give birth and breasts that give no milk.  The LORD says, "All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them.  I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions.  I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels.  The people of Israel are stricken.  Their roots are dried up; they will bear no more fruit.  And if they give birth, I will slaughter their beloved children."  (Hosea 9:11-16 NLT)<br>  Kill Men, Women, and Children.  "Then I heard the LORD say to the other men, "Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked.  Show no mercy; have no pity!  Kill them all – old and young, girls and women and little children.  But do not touch anyone with the mark.  Begin your task right here at the Temple."  So they began by killing the seventy leaders.  "Defile the Temple!" the LORD commanded.  "Fill its courtyards with the bodies of those you kill!  Go!"  So they went throughout the city and did as they were told."  (Ezekiel 9:5-7 NLT)<br>  God Kills all the First Born of Egypt.  And at midnight the LORD killed all the firstborn sons in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn son of the captive in the dungeon. Even the firstborn of their livestock were killed.  Pharaoh and his officials and all the people of Egypt woke up during the night, and loud wailing was heard throughout the land of Egypt. There was not a single house where someone had not died.  (Exodus 12:29-30 NLT)<br>  Kill Old Men and Young Women.  "You are my battle-ax and sword," says the LORD.  "With you I will shatter nations and destroy many kingdoms.  With you I will shatter armies, destroying the horse and rider, the chariot and charioteer.  With you I will shatter men and women, old people and children, young men and maidens.  With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks, farmers and oxen, captains and rulers.  "As you watch, I will repay Babylon and the people of Babylonia for all the wrong they have done to my people in Jerusalem," says the LORD.  "Look, O mighty mountain, destroyer of the earth!  I am your enemy," says the LORD.  "I will raise my fist against you, to roll you down from the heights.  When I am finished, you will be nothing but a heap of rubble.  You will be desolate forever.  Even your stones will never again be used for building.  You will be completely wiped out," says the LORD.  (Jeremiah 51:20-26)<br>  God Will Kill the Children of Sinners.  If even then you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey, I will inflict you with seven more disasters for your sins.  I will release wild animals that will kill your children and destroy your cattle, so your numbers will dwindle and your roads will be deserted.  (Leviticus 26:21-22 NLT)<br>  More Rape and Baby Killing.  Anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword.  Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes.  Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes.  For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off.  The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows.  They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children.  (Isaiah 13:15-18 NLT)<br>  1) Murder, rape, and pillage at Jabesh-gilead  (Judges 21:10-24 NLT)   So they sent twelve thousand warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children.  "This is what you are to do," they said. "Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin."  Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to them as wives.  But there were not enough women for all of them.  The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel.  So the Israelite leaders asked, "How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead?  There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever.  But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse."  Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.  They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, "Go and hide in the vineyards.  When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife!  And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding.  Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in marriage to them.'"  So the men of Benjamin did as they were told.  They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance.  Then they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.  So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.  Obviously these women were repeatedly raped.  These sick bastards killed and raped an entire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road to kidnap and rape some more.  How can anyone see this as anything but evil?<br>  2) Murder, rape and pillage of the Midianites    (Numbers 31:7-18 NLT)  They attacked Midian just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.  All five of the Midianite kings – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba – died in the battle.  They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.  Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder.  They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived.  After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.    Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.  But Moses was furious with all the military commanders who had returned from the battle.  "Why have you let all the women live?" he demanded.  "These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor.  They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people.  Now kill all the boys and all the women who have slept with a man.  Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.Clearly Moses and God approves of rape of virgins.<br>  3) More Murder Rape and Pillage   (Deuteronomy 20:10-14)   As you approach a town to attack it, first offer its people terms for peace.  If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor.  But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town.  When the LORD your God hands it over to you, kill every man in the town.  But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder.  You may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the LORD your God has given you. What kind of God approves of murder, rape, and slavery?<br>  4) Laws of Rape   (Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT)  If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.What kind of lunatic would make a rape victim marry her attacker?  Answer: God.<br>  5) Death to the Rape Victim   (Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB)   If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife. It is clear that God doesn't give a damn about the rape victim.  He is only concerned about the violation of another mans "property".<br>  6) David's Punishment - Polygamy, Rape, Baby Killing, and God's "Forgiveness" (2 Samuel 12:11-14 NAB)  Thus says the Lord: 'I will bring evil upon you out of your own house.  I will take your wives [plural] while you live to see it, and will give them to your neighbor.  He shall lie with your wives in broad daylight.  You have done this deed in secret, but I will bring it about in |`|i6d582PFaa	even atheists know this answer: because religion is used to brainwash the masses.

The term 'sellout' derives from black people who would betray their own people for their own personal benefit, as house slaves would 'sellout' fellow slaves who tried to escape to their master for there benefit.|`|pfke6Jieaa	i think if u wanna be in a interracial relationship then go for it. as long as u dont forget ur heritage and u still embrace it. u dont need to worship it or anything just dont forget or ignore who u r. and love is love it has no color and race means little to nothing to me. but a lot of ppl have racial preferences, they need to focus on the person more than anything else.|`|C9QQPROkaa	I prefer interracial relationships but anyone should be free to be with anyone they want whether it be their own race or not.

But that does not change the facts and that is even tho the Church was not well Organized which took a few hundred yrs to do Peter was Head of the Church on Earth and the Bishop of Rome was recognized as such even the Eastern Church Still calls the Bishop of Rome first among Equals.As for CJ's new title no matter how he tries he still can not disguise who he is from Chris to Cj To Jesus is my Lord as he is a victim of his own personality.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	ON HIS OWN WILL -- are you daft!?

Which was part of Hitlers indoctrination same as Mugabe now sadly. And yes the pope still holds the same position as the popes have done throughout the last two thousand years the only difference now is that there are 39000 Christian protestant denominations.<br>  <br>  The sick depraved Nazis did that, you cannot blame the innocent children forced into those youth camps ( yes some of those children persecuted Jews on minor levels as many people did in Europe in those days not just Nazis)!.

Mabbitt says the first thing he wanted to do after leaving Durango was find a way to release the raw energy and anger that had built up during his stay there. “I wrote my first song the day I got out,” Mabbitt remembers. “I hopped on the computer and found that this band, Blessthefall, were looking for a singer, so I tried out.”<br>                                  Good Luck

This is not always possible ie autopsy etc.<br>  The muslim is buried in white pieces of cotton cloth, the shroud. Before the funeral happens the body has to be washed and bathed, firstly with the ritual washing done for prayer. If the deceased was male a male relative  washes the body and vice versa for a female usuallly done in the mosque.<br>  The body is taken to the mosque for the funeral prayer. This always happens after the 2nd prayer of the day, afternoon prayer (Muslims pray 5 times a day).All the congergation have to have been washed called wudu( ritual washing for perfoimng prayer)<br>   <br>  This prayer is different as you do not kneel down in prayer like the other prayers. This is due to the other prayers being bowen down to God.<br>  <br>  The coffin is placed at the front of the prayer hall, which the congregation read following the imam behind him. The imam is standing at the coffin facing Kabaa, Muslims direction of prayer.<br>  <br>  After the funeral prayer, the male congregation go with the herse to the graveyard with the imam where the coffin is placed in the ground. A further prayer is recited.All muslims are buried facing the Kaaba<br>  <br>  Muslims believe this is when the life begins. They are visited by the angel and is asked who they followed, what is their religion etc.<br>  <br>  The punishment starts in the grave.They will wait there until time or resurection when all will stand in front of God to be judged according to their deeds on earth.<br>  <br>  Muslims have a duty to go to the funeral and graveyard as everyone will die and is a constant reminder of your place after you die. Noone wants to think of death but it helps you remember the purpose of life is to remember God and what is awaiting us.|`|zhaHc4FAaa	Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include:[1]<br>  <br>  Bathing the dead body,[2] except in extraordinary circumstances as in battle of Uhud.[3] <br>  Enshrouding dead body in a cotton or linen cloth.[4] <br>  Funeral prayer.[5] <br>  Burial of the dead body in a grave. <br>  Positioning the deceased so that the head is faced towards Mecca (Makkah Al-Mukarramah). <br>  <br>   Bathing of the dead body<br>  The corpse is washed (ghusl bathed), the main factor in this step is to physically cleanse the corpse. The method, the style and the accessories used for bathing the corpse may vary from time to time and from place to place. Bathing a corpse, in whatever method, is a part of the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad,[6] and therefore a part of the Islamic Sharia. The body is washed while a cloth is put on top of it. The water is then poured over the body with the cloth on the body. The genitals should be covered at all times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Enshrouding the dead body<br>  The corpse is wrapped in a simple plain cloth. The cloth is called kafan and the process takfīn. The main factor in this step is to respectfully wrap the corpse in a cloth so that its private parts are not visible to others. The style of this wrapping and the material and the color of the cloth used for this wrapping may vary from place to place and from time to time. However, the important aspect in the style of wrapping and the material used is that it should be a simple rather than a gaudy style and the cloth used for this purpose should also not be very flashy. It is for this reason that Muslims have generally preferred to use white cotton cloth to serve as kafan. It is allowed to put some perfume on the cloth.<br>  <br>   Funeral prayer<br>  The Muslims of the community gather to offer their collective prayers for the forgiveness of the dead. This prayer has been generally termed as the Salat al-Janazah (Janazah prayer).<br>  <br>  The prayer is offered in a particular way. Like Eid prayer, this prayer is also prayed with extra (four[8]) Takbirs, the Arabic name for the phrase Allahu Akbar, but there is no Ruku' (bowing) and Sujud (prostrating). Supplication for the deceased and mankind is recited. In extraordinary circumstances, the prayer can be postponed and prayed at a later time as was done in the Battle of Uhud.[5] It becomes obligatory for every Muslim adult male to perform the funeral prayer upon the death of any Muslim, however when it is performed by the few it alleviates that obligation for all.[9]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Burial<br>   <br>  Grave of a MuslimThe deceased is then taken for burial (al-Dafin). The style of the grave and that of the burial may vary from place to place due to different methodologies surrounding funeral proceedings. The Islamic directive is restricted to a respectful burial in the ground.<br>  <br>  The grave itself should be aligned perpendicular to the Qibla (i.e. towards Mecca). The wrapped body is placed directly into the ground, without a casket. Graves should be raised, up to a maximum of 12 inches (30 cm) above the ground. Grave markers are simple, because outwardly lavish displays are discouraged in Islam. Many times graves may even be unmarked, or marked only with a simple wreath. However, it is becoming more common for family members to erect grave monuments.<br>  <br>  Women are generally discouraged from participating in the funeral procession. The reason for this is that in most cases, a woman's emotional nature would cause her to make a scene in the presence of other men, which is not allowed in Islam.[10] The body is laid such that the head is facing the Qibla. Those present at the grave each take their turn in pouring three handfuls of soil into the grave while reciting "We created you from it, and return you into it, and from it we will raise you a second time".[11] More prayers are then said, asking for forgiveness of the deceased, and reminding the dead of his or her profession of faith.<br>  <br>   <br>  In a Tatar Muslim cemeteryAfter the burial, the Muslims who have gathered to pay their respects to the dead, collectively pray for the forgiveness of the dead. This collective prayer is the last formal collective prayer for the dead.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Mourning<br>  Loved ones and relatives are to observe a 3-day mourning period.[12] Mourning is observed in Islam by increased devotion, receiving visitors and condolences, and avoiding decorative clothing and jewelry.<br>  <br>  Widows observe an extended mourning period (iddah, period of waiting), 4 months and 10 days long,[13] in accordance with the Qur'an.[14] During that time, the widow is not to remarry, move from her home, or change her clothes from the colour of black.<br>  <br>  Grief at the death of a beloved person is normal, and weeping for the dead is allowed in Islam.[15] It is however prohibited to express grief by wailing (bewailing refers to mourning in a loud voice), shrieking, beating the chest and cheeks, tearing hair or clothes, breaking objects, scratching faces or speaking phrases that make a Muslim lose faith.

2509779805db68e9ed8f286e83d10b4eaa	I disagree, Even though that is why He came to earth. He calls death an enemy in 1st Cr 15:26 So why would a righteous Holy Perfect human/ God embrace an enemy. <br>  <br>  The only reason is, that His death was the lesser of two evils. either He died to buy us back from satan or we all die with no chance at real life. To give real life and give it more abundantly is why He came to earth. He did not consider this life much of a life. He told the one fellow "let the dead bury their own dead." So without the life He was dying to give us He did even count this as life but a walking death.
NaM4ZT64aa	Because there were hundreds of different accounts of Jesus' life, none of which were based on eye witness accounts.  More than several people wrote under the name of "Mark."|`|4sUek7ugaa	Apparently someone decided to add a passage about the resurrection after the original text was written.

They end at Mark 16:8.  They are lacking in the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus (the Vatican text), although nearly all other manuscripts of Mark contain verses 9-20.<br>  <br>  The underlying Greek manuscripts of the King James and the New King James have those verses.<br>  <br>  The translators of the modern paraphrases of the Bible (like the NIV) are on a scholarly ego trip and chose controversial manuscripts on purpose that did not contain clear readings of the texts so they could copyright their paraphrases and try to make a buck off unsuspecting evangelical christian denominations by selling their bibles as new and improved "scholarly" paraphrases of their bible.|`|LnpBSpjSaa	That's a good a religious question.  And I say it's good, because most people ignore these discrepancies.<br>  <br>  I've done some research into the origins of Christianity and some of the findings were quite surprising for me.<br>  <br>  For example, there were different schools of Christianity in the first 100 AD.  However, Rome, decided to control of it.  Then their first appointed Bishop declared what he thought were legitimate Christian ideas, texts, etc and he burned the rest and declared any one against him, a "heretic." That's where it began. Meanwhile the other schools of Christianity thought the Roman Bishop totally didn't get Jesus' message.<br>  <br>  However, not all is forgotten.  In the early 50's, ancient scrolls were discovered hidden the caves.  What was discovered?  A very different type of Christianity, known as the Gnostic Gospels, discovered in these: Nag Hammadi Scrolls, which date back to the same time.<br>  <br>  As for the traditional Gospels and your original question, the scholars point out that the original texts of traditional gospels, Matthew, Mark, John, at in parts as thought they were word for word plagiarized from one another.   Then they differ on the other parts.  So it really does make one wonder on the authenticity of their origins.  I don't know how the vast majority can just turn a blind eye at such things and take every word as such undeniable, literal Gospel Truth.  Absurd in my opinion.

msNXomjTaa	Talk about confusion!  There is NOTHING in Scripture that says you cannot eat meat during Lent!  Of course, there is also nothing in Scripture about Lent either, so this makes sense.<br>  <br>  Lent is a time of preparation for the great event of Easter.  It is meant for reflection, learning, and penitence.  Typically, this was the home stretch for people preparing for baptism, so learning was important, and still is for some people.  Others will make a personal sacrifice, which often includes giving up a food.  For me, I have resolved to read a certain amount of the Bible daily.  However, there is no "rule" that says you cannot eat meat during Lent.  It may be a custom for some, but not a rule.<br>  <br>  These things take a life of their own.  For years, Roman Catholics ate fish on Fridays.  They thought they were supposed to.  However, Friday was a regular fast day (as was Wednesday, but a lesser one).  People could give up meat for the fast for that day.  As meat covered beef, mutton, and red meats, fish was considered okay, as it is not red meat.  So people ate fish instead of beef, and eventually became the "rule" that you had to eat fish on Fridays.  There never was any such rule.  My guess is a "rule" to give up meat during Lent is the same.  Most people give up sweets.  This is why the Tuesday before Lent is called Mardi-Gras - or "Fat Tuesday."  People ate the rich, fat, and sugar filled foods that day, as they could not during Lent.|`|LsG95WF8aa	They have no clue, they just do it because their taught to and they think if they dont god will hate them and send them to hell.|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	Baaa...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Dearie, this is EVERYBODY in the world in respect to something. <br>  <br>  There are people who don't know<br>  -- Who their senator is,<br>  -- Where Mexico is located<br>  -- What do in case of a fire<br>  <br>  But Catholicism has this one distinction that you seem unaware of (though it doesn't excuse lazy ignorance), that to be a Catholic is to believe that Jesus Himself instituted the Church with His Authority as the guardian of His teaching on Faith and Morals, soooo one's main responsibility is to what is  and what isn't required of a Catholic. <br>  <br>  Some children obey their father about eating their vegetables, but only a few ask, Why are they good for you ?

XN0cYCATaa	I disagree, I looked at that site and picked one out of the Bunch there, the one about The Shape of the Earth <br>  "He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in," (Isaiah 40:22, NIV). <br>  <br>  Now for one thing, there is no Hebrew word for Sphere, Circle is quite sufficient.<br>  <br>  The Most important thing about interpreting Biblical passages is Context.<br>  In the Bible, Context is King, The web site you posted, has taken Biblical scriptures way off context, this is normal, for those whos mind is not Transformed by it's renewing, (rom12:2) they wil not be able to comprehend it.<br>  1st Cor 2:14 say's that the Natural man cannot understand the things tyhat are of the spirit of God for it is foolishness unto him nor can he kow them for they arew spiritually Discerned.<br>  This means that no matter how many years a Non-believer studies the Bible even to the point of memorizing every scripture, he/she will not be able to understand it.<br>  Only those whom the Holy Spirit Directs will be able to comprehend it.<br>  <br>  The Bible does speak of  Scientific Accuracies of the Bible<br>  Many people doubt the Bible for various reasons. One of them is that the Bible is not accurate scientifically. But this just isn't so. The Bible is not a book about science, but when it does speak scientifically, it is accurate. In fact, it was far ahead of any other writing of its time. Please consider the following:<br>  <br>  The Shape of the Earth <br>  "He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in," (Isaiah 40:22, NIV). <br>  This may or may not be construed to support the spherical shape of the earth.  The horizon is a circle and a circle is flat. <br>  The Earth is suspended in nothing <br>  "He spreads out the northern[skies] over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing," (Job. 26:7, NIV). <br>  This is particularly interesting, considering that the cosmology of other cultures at that time did not have the earth suspended in nothing, but rather upon pillars, or people, or animals. <br>  The Stars are Innumerable <br>  "He took him outside and said, 'Look up at the heavens and count the stars -- if indeed you can count them.' Then he said to him, 'So shall your offspring be,'" (Gen. 15:5, NIV). <br>  The Existence of Valleys in the Seas <br>  "The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils," (2 Sam. 22:16, NIV). <br>  The Existence of Springs and Fountains in the Seas <br>  "In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month -- on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened," (Genesis 7:11, NIV). See also Gen. 8:2; Prov. 8:28. <br>  The Existence of Water Paths (Ocean Currents) in the Seas <br>  "O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!...When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,...You made him [man] ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet...the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas," (Psalm 8:1,3,6,8, NIV). <br>  The Hydrologic Cycle <br>  "He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight," (Job. 26:8, NIV). <br>  "He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams; the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind," (Job. 36:27-28, NIV) <br>  "The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again" (Ecclesiastes 1:6-7, NIV). <br>  The Concept of Entropy <br>  "In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded," (Psalm 102:22-26, NIV). <br>  The Nature of Health, Sanitation, and Sickness <br>  The listing for this section is too large for this page. But the scriptural references are Leviticus 12-14.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	it's only a problem when people try to read genesis literally.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	If you would want to go into a long and in-depth study... sure you could "refute" that person... but why bother... it is clear he has no real understanding of The True Christian Faith... at least as far as I got before I could take no more...<br>  <br>  Those like that man have no understanding because they do not want to... so I do not bother "refuting" them... <br>  <br>  One thing is correct however...

It does neither, yet, we know we revolve around the sun.  Anyone saying that what is written in the Bible here, is God telling us a scientific fact, or mis-fact, is simply looking for errors where there are none (which is most often the case).  The sun stood still... it did not rise, and it did not set.<br>  <br>  The stability of the earth: again, none of these are scientific observations.  How could they be?  Why would they be?<br>  <br>  I could answer all of them.  People are looking for things that aren't there.  They misunderstand God's Word, because they want to.  Those who want to know and understand God's Word will put their faith in Him.  Those who don't, will twist it and use it to destroy, to their own destruction.<br>  <br>  Sorry, none of those verses are a problem for me... but I don't want to spend the next hour retorting how silly they are.  Answer a fool, or answer not a fool... the fool remains a fool (not talking about you, here).<br>  <br>  --------<br>  <br>  "as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.<br>  <br>  On a spherical earth, one could travel east or west indefinitely. This passage seems to be saying that there is a limit to the directions east and west."<br>  <br>  No, it's not saying that at all, actually.  Quite the opposite.  God has removed our sins as far as the east is, from the west.  Even on Earth, I can continually walk East, lapping over and over endlessly, if that is the application.  Sounds like the person trying to point out problems w/ the Bible is a poor scientist, linguist, and certainly no scholar! :)<br>  <br>  Even today we say, "the four corners" of the Earth.  And, "To the end of the Earth," and, things like that.  People who are using the language of the Bible against it, only do so because they hate God, and are at emnity with Him.  Try and reason with them, but don't expect much.  They have made their decision where they stand--that is, to twist His Word.  This will not go unpunished, and it will be without excuse.

We can't control how our genes get shuffled around when we reproduce, so sure enough some kid would be born with a strong "god gene," get all delusional, and make up some sky fairy to comfort him.  And a few gullible ones would follow along.  It of course wouldn't be the same gods that have been made up here -- it'd probably be a god of spaceships or space colonies -- but somebody would probably come up with some nonsense :(<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	I believe animism is a necessary stage in the development of religion and it arises among pre-city dwellers in pre-scientific cultures. So far it seems to be a stage all primitive societies go through, with more sophisticated notions of metaphysics developing from animism arising as the old notions are increasingly put to flight by scientific development and reason. For instance the Canaanite god Yah started as a mountain god, and one of many. By the time dualistic monotheism develops Yahweh is omni-present, the only god, demanding burnt entrails and blood, Eventually that goes away as Yahweh retreats to the heavens, and when these are also pierced, retreats to other dimensions,<br>  <br>  So I tend to think a spaceflight culture that begins without religion would not invent one. Religion begins as a means to explain and attempt to influence natural events in pre-scientific cultures. A scientific culture explains natural events without resorting to labeling it magic. So animism never develops and neither do its successors.|`|e74d7fb53114fa13fe69e5302e1bf0c4aa	I don't think it would.

Perhaps you have never considered it.<br>  <br>  Why do evolutionists ignore this evidence?<br>  <br>  When ALL of the evidence is fairly, honestly, and reasonably evaluated, I believe the conclusion has to be that there is a God and everything was created by Him!<br>  <br>  For example: Atheists promote their theory of evolution, and they say that the dinosaurs were extinct about 45 million years before the first man. <br>  <br>  They, however, never mention the petroglyphs that show images of known, recognizable dinosaurs in Natural Bridges National Park (Utah, USA); Montrose County, Colorado; and the Grand Canyon. They never explain the ancient dinosaur figurines found in Mexico, the dinosaurs painted on burial stones found in Peru, or the dinosaur sculpture on an ancient Cambodian temple.<br>  <br>  They never answer these questions:<br>  <br>  1. If these are not dinosaurs, what are they and why do they look so much like known, recognizable dinosaurs?<br>  <br>  2. If they are dinosaurs, how did those men know what they looked like?  (All of these examples are art that pre-dates when these dinosaurs were “discovered” from fossils.)<br>  <br>  Also, a T-rex fossil has been found that still had soft tissue that was "still flexible and elastic".  When stretched this tissue returned to its original shape. This type of dinosaur is said to have been extinct for almost 70 Million years. How did such soft tissue survive that long?<br>  <br>  What logical, reasonable explanation do you have?<br>  <br>  **** edit ****<br>  I always get "thumbs down" when I speak of this evidence on Y!A.

Perhaps no person had ever been exposed before.  Some think it may have been contracted from men having sexual relations with animals.  Perhaps it, or a form of it, has existed in animals for thousands of years, but that animal's system could deal with it and when it got introduced into humans it began to spread unchecked because it was in an environment where the natural defenses were not present.<br>  <br>  If this virus did not exist before, what did it evolve from?

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

These are guides to keep us out from falling into apostasy. Paul was used by God to be one of the Apostles to give us instructions and admonitions even to this present times of the dead end period. It doesn't mean that Paul's writings can be equaled to the writings of the Prophets which had been called by God to record the things to come that had been fulfilled already and are about to be fulfilled soon. The New Testament is the confirmations of the fulfillment of the prophecies of the men of God. The Four Gospels are confirmations of the promise of God in Genesis 3:15 and the prophecies of Isaiah and other prophets. Luke and Paul had been called by God to be historians that we in this generations might be aware of what had been happening in the early days of Christianity. God knew that Satan will use Christianity to deceive many even His  most elect.  And He had set a mark upon His true followers. Revelation 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. So we have the mark and these are those who obey the commandments and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. There are no other doctrine that God had set upon His people but only these two. Obey the Ten Commandments and bear the testimony of Jesus Christ. Revelation 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. So it is clear that God looks after those who keep His commandments and have the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we should thank God also for the people He used to give us the records and accounts of the things concerning Jesus through the writers of the New Testaments. And to confirm the old prophets the book of Revelation was given to John the Beloved. He was the last of the Apostles to die just to confirm to us the authenticity of the Holy Bible.

And as with the Twelve, so with all the saints, of whom the scripture saith: "Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?" (2 Cor. 13:5.)   <br>  <br>  What does it mean for the Holy Ghost to dwell in us? First be it noted, the scriptures say that God, meaning the Father, "dwelleth in us," and that "he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him." (1 John 4:12-16.) Be it remembered also that the same applies to the Son. "Christ liveth in me," Paul said. (Galatians 2:20.) And also: "Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith." (Ephesians 3:17.) And yet again: "Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates." (2 Corinthians 13:5.) Then the scriptures say that "the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones," as do the Father and the Son, "but is a personage of Spirit." To this is added the somewhat enigmatic statement: "Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us."<br>  <br>  In other words, the saints have the gift of the Holy Ghost which reveals to them "the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2:9-16), so that Christ in effect dwells in each righteous member of the Church and reigns in the midst of their congregations.<br>  <br>  Reprobates] Disobedient, depraved, and unprincipled persons who have departed from the faith and are thereby rejected of God.
sjMIFH9Faa	Good question, but poorly understood. <br>  <br>  Really, every gives the high school history class answer. The Church was corrupt and took advantage of people and Martin Luther saved the day. <br>  <br>  Although thats not entirely inaccurate, surly the fact that citizens of the Holy Roman Empire were forced by the Holy Roman Emperor to pay a special Church tax contributed to the "Reformation" but that doesn't tell the whole story...or even half of it really.<br>  <br>  Throughout its history, what we call the Catholic Church, had always faced reformers and made changes. People like to think of the Chruch as a absolutist institution, however its far more organic. <br>  <br>  An example of this would be Grosticism and St. Augustine. People assume that Augustine was a pius follower of Christianity, but thats not really accurate, he was a reformer. His writings were actually in some disagreements with the Church of his era, but Augustines arguments and theology was so persuasive that instead of fighting him, the Church incorporated many of his ideas into in faith, now he is a Doctor of the Chruch. Gnosticism, on the other hand was a reforming movement that didn't get incorporated by the faith, mostly because it didn't really add anything to the theology. <br>  <br>  Really, their are examples of this throughout Church history. St. Thomas Aquinas for a short time was considered a heratic, and people wern't supposed to read his work, but over time they incorporated his ideas into the faith. The Investiture Crises of England and Germany can be seen a reformation movement. <br>  <br>  So the "Reformation" which was begun by Martin Luther was really nothing out of the ordinary. He was one of many forgotten reformers, like Augustine or Aquinas or even John Wycliff. But Martin Luther is different because his ideas were niether embraced by the Church (if you read his writings, its not hard to figure out why, I suggest "On the Jews and their Lies") but the Chruch wasn't able to stomp his ideas out. Thus, instead of changing the "organic" Church, his followers created his own. <br>  <br>  The corruption issue is a major simplification and has just as much to do with political issues as it does religious issues. But the truth is, before the "Reformation" the Catholic Chruch had many reforming movements, for a variety of reasons. But the Church was usually able to embrace the movement, or it would slowly go away, or in some cases be stompped out (it was actually quite rare though). Luter's movement is very misunderstood, and he is a charactor that has a much greater legacy than he deserves. He was a reformer like many others.|`|AA11521494	At the time of the Reformation, it was felt by some that the catholic church had gone far away from what the church should be.  There had been popes who had behaved like despotic kings, at one point 2 popes at the same time because of disagreements, the selling of indulgences (fast track to heaven if you could pay) - all sorts of quite unbelievable abuses.  Finally it became all too much and Martin Luther and others felt they HAD to protest.<br>  <br>  However, once you break away from the catholic church, there is the possibility of dividing further even over quite little things - and that's why all the denominations.|`|ade88a86096da6caf982d633e21cd939aa	Vast corruption was in the Church during the Middle Ages.

Ever since Isaac Newton, science has blared a clear message: the world follows rules, rules that are fundamentally mathematical, rules that humans can figure out. Humans invent abstract mathematics, basically making it up out of their imaginations, yet math magically turns out to describe the world. Greek mathematicians divided the circumference of a circle by its diameter, for example, and got the number pi, 3.14159 . . . . Pi turns up in equations that describe subatomic particles, light and other quantities that have no obvious connections to circles. This points, says Polkinghorne, ""to a very deep fact about the nature of the universe,'' namely, that our minds, which invent mathematics, conform to the reality of the cosmos. We are somehow tuned in to its truths. Since pure thought can penetrate the universe's mysteries, ""this seems to be telling us that something about human consciousness is harmonious with the mind of God,'' says Carl Feit, a cancer biologist at Yeshiva University in New York and Talmudic scholar.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Yes. the creation of an entire universe would require something to be creating it.

On one hand, I would have to say "yes", because the "entire universe" is an idea, which requires a consciousness for its existence, namely you.  Outside of the realm of the intellect, with regard to some kind of external "reality" I think it is indeterminate.  For the sake of argument, let's skip the semantics and assume that we're working from a common definition of what consciousness is.  Then we will say that consciousness exists.  Does this mean that it has always existed?  If we follow big bang nucleosynthesis, originally we have a photon filled universe, during expansion and inflation, we get some leptons and gradually hadrons which result in a bunch of hydrogen and a little bit of helium and lithium.  Can we say that these did not exist before--after all, their mass is derived from the initial energy of the big bang?  Does the table exist inside of the tree, or does the table come to existence only once it is made?  The universe clearly made our consciousness.  I am inclined to believe that our consciousness came into existence when we did, and that our projection of our consciousness back out into the universe is what we refer to as gods.  But these gods are clearly feeble in comparison to the universe itself, because consciousness is only a single aspect of its entity.  So I would argue that the universe did not require consciousness in its creation, since even at the beginning the universe was much "bigger" than what we know as consciousness, it is what we know as real.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	No.|`|RsXV2FAmaa	In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.<br>  <br>  This is the first verse in the Bible.

It should be taken as seriously as any other major decision in life - with prayer, careful investigation, and family involvement. It is Islamically permissible for a couple to meet in chaperoned, or group environment. In Islam consent is very important- that is neither women nor men can be married against their will. Islam has given this freedom of choice to both young men and women - they cannot be forced into a marriage that they don't want.<br>  <br>  The Prophet (peace be upon him) also reportedly said, "Whenever a man is alone with a woman, Satan (Shaytan) is the third among them" (Tirmidhi).

That could be a relative, friend, or any good person he knows of. For example young Yasmine is ready for marriage. She asks her parents (or her parents offer it to her and she agrees) to find a spouse.<br>  <br>  They know their daughter quite well and they know of suitors for her. They make recommendations and arrange for a meeting. They are present with the young man as well as someone from his side. Then the two meet and discuss what they are looking for in their future spouse as well as answer any questions the other might have.<br>  <br>  If the first meeting goes well then the may meet again under the same circumstances. Usually the first meeting gives a good yes or no. If no her/his parents will bring another suggestion. If yes then things continue until quite clear and both agree then there is something called ket-bel-ketab. The writing of the book. <br>  <br>  They become offically married by making this 'legal' ceremony. After and ONLY after this point can they be together alone. Then if they wish they may have the wedding ceremony that announces to everyone that they are officially married. Some couples do both in one day, others do just the official writing first until things are all ready and then make the big ceremony afterwards.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as testing the waters or taking the car for a test drive in Islam. These are considered degrading for a person to have to be used like that and made sure first that this is what is okay. If they don't like it then the just get thrown away? I never could understand the wisdom or plainly the concept of this theory.|`|TsmqhvZHaa	it has to do with prearanged marriages

Let alone the fact that it obviously hasn't made them any more intelligent, the fact that most of them are still smoking it, certainly doesn't support their argument that it isn't addictive. <br>  <br>  Yes, many prescriptions are highly addictive. Look up vicodin, oxycontin, and any of the barbiturates. Any pharmaceutical based on opiates (opium) is highly addictive. Many sleep aids are addictive.<br>  <br>  One person mentioned alcohol. It's one of the most addictive and damaging drugs around, while being the most accepted by society.

Yw1k1W19aa	Contrary to popular myth, historians now know rather a lot about these cards. Tarot cards were created in mid 15th century Italy for the Milanese court. They consist of a standard pack of Latin suited playing cards with a fifth suit of picture cards. These extra cards took as their theme, not an occult philosophy, but a Christian triumph procession - hence their early name of trionfi, meaning triumphs and from which we get our word trump. It was the invention of tarot that marked the invention of trumps in card games - and this is what they were created for, a family of card games that continues to be played throughout continental Europe to this day.<br>  <br>  There may well have been a Christian allegory in the trumps, but there is very little evidence from which to determine what it might have been. However, doing so will mean looking properly at the symbols in the context of when and where they were made. The first thing to keep in mind is that these were Christian and not all heretical - the Church never objected to them. One good example is The Female Pope, often cited by occultists and readers as a heresy the church tried to suppress, which it didn't. In 15th century Italy, this was an established figure in religious art, being used in Christian images to represent such things as The New Covenant and the Virtue of Faith.<br>  <br>  It was not until the end of the 18th century that a Parisian occultist, Antoine Court de Gebelin picked up the cards and, ignorant of their true origin, invented one of his own about their being from Ancient Egypt and having a use in Divination.<br>  <br>  Without an occult origin, fortune telling with tarot cards is no different in kind from fortune telling with tea leaves, dominoes, or knuckle bones and I find it just as hard to take seriously.<br>  <br>  However, I have been playing the card games for many years and can recommend them as being excellent and possibly the best in the world. After all, games that have spread through a continent and endured for 600 years are going to be good!<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about the history:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.trionfi.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.trionfi.com</a><br>  The Game of Tarot by Michael Dummett (Duckworth 1980)<br>  <br>  If you would like to learn how to play the games and where to buy cards for them:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tarocchino.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tarocchino.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pagat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pagat.com</a>|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello Emma<br>  <br>  I think that the tarot are a wonderful tool for personal & psychic development, meditation, guidance & insight.<br>  <br>  Yes, I have tried them. <br>  <br>  Have studied them for over 20 years, teach them, have an home study course, e- books based on symbolism & an on line community. <br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	We own several decks at home, and my wife is actually very adept at reading them for people.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Agreed with CC.

Ordinarily, I wouldn't touch it. But sometimes, as in the present instance--just to show them how they went wrong by choosing a heterosexual lifestyle--I like to sort straight peoples' feculent matter out for them.  As we approach this particular nasty matter, bear in mind that the chief distinguishing characteristic of straight people--as opposed to gay people--is the inability to think things through. This is the unfortunate but perfectly understandable result of belonging to a smug majority who "naturally" assume that any opinion they happen to hold is correct, beyond any necessity of proof, or even of its being in accord with other opinions that they adhere to.  Consequently, there is always a certain jumbledness, or muddle, in heterosexual argumentation.  Case in point, the "comparison" the questioner tries to make between homosexuals at the beginning of his question.  We understand eventually that, in the questioner's view, a masculine older man who dates college boys is less honorable and trustworthy than an older man who is in a monogamous relationship with another older man, "like a general or a judge."  Why, exactly, the questioner associates a monogamous disposition with trustworthiness, and even honor and "a solid, unbreakable character," he does not tell us; nor does he explain how these noble virtues are epitomized in judges and generals--I think he intends, in typical heterosexual fashion, that, since he has given it to be so, we are obliged to accept that it is so.  And, of course, we don't--but the questioner is in a hurry to tell us that an older homosexual who dates college men will (1) double cross you in business dealings, and (2) is bad, and (3) is difficult to distinguish from homosexuals that are honorable and trustworthy--if any such there be; and the questioner seems clearly to doubt that there are any such. <br>  <br>   In sum, what we have is not a question, but a diatribe in barely interrogative guise, malicious and defamatory in intent, and mawkishly, almost touchingly, absurd in its definition of positive values (e.g., the honor and trustworthiness of judges and generals).  Still, rather than report and delete it, I vote that we keep this question here in the GLBT Y/A section, as a caution (There's a world of mean-spirited bigotry out there) and as an example of what, as gays and Lesbians, we have been spared.

He started the process.<br>  <br>  Similarly, you can NOT cause your own spiritual birth, you have to be begotten from your heavenly father. He chooses to give you this "new birth" in heaven.<br>  <br>  -------------------------<br>  <br>  John 3:3- (NRSV)Jesus answered him, "Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above." <br>  <br>  The Greek expression translated "is born again" can also be rendered "should be born from above". Thus, according to that  rendering, the new birth originates "from above" - that is, " from heaven," or " from the father." YES, it is CAUSED by God not by the person himself......see  1 John 3:9 .....Since you are chosen by God because of your faithfulness and obedience to his word, you can NOT hand it down to your family members, children, friends etc...as if it were a requirement of just a faith belief system that you feel strong about. We are all different, so God will pick who he chooses. You can NOT make it happen just by saying and believing you are born again.  You must be "born again" by God<br>  <br>  So what does it mean to be born again, you ask?<br>  <br>  Note carefully that, in discussing this matter, Jesus did not say that all who would gain everlasting life must be “born again.” Rather, what Jesus said was that unless one was “born again” he could not see the “kingdom of God.” Now the kingdom of God is heavenly. God has purposed that the Kingdom be the capital or ruling part of his universal organization. God also purposed that a limited number, taken from among mankind, would reign with Christ Jesus as associate kings. For this sublime privilege they must be resurrected and given spirit bodies, since, as the apostle said, “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom.” That the Father has set a limitation on the number of those who will reign with his Son in the heavenly kingdom is manifest from Jesus’ words: “Have no fear, little flock, because your Father has approved of giving you the kingdom.” The exact number of the “little flock” approved by the Father to be Kingdom heirs was not known until Christ, through an angel, revealed it to be 144,000 “who have been purchased from the earth.” This “little flock” of 144,000 Kingdom heirs, then, are those ones from among mankind who are “born again.”—1?Cor. 15:50; Luke 12:32; Rev. 14:1-3, NW.|`|AA11935914	to have your cake and eat it too.

"Pastry" is the general word which is related to dough used both for spaghetti or sweets.<br>  <br>  So "una pasta" can be a dough to cook a sweet or a cake, but PASTA (in Italian is always singular) translates the worlds of spaghetti, penne ect etc|`|3S3XjvYcaa	"No, questo è Italia, abbiamo la pasta!"<br>  I think "la pasta" means spaghetti type of pasta also...|`|tQsxsuNPaa	I believe LA Pasta is what we call pasta in English.<br>  <br>  Online translators CAN be used, especially one word at a time, effectively.  <br>  <br>  Dictionaries work really well, too.

gDVQNMR7aa	It is absolutely amazing to me that someone asks for a source on the antisemitism of the Catholic Church. This is surely a sign that the individual has no clue of the history of the Catholic Church. This is very frightening - this sheer ignorance.<br>  <br>  As for your question, I think the man is a fool.<br>  <br>  Edit- I don't need your help, little girl. I read apparently FAR more than you do. Do you know why the RCC chose to change when Christ died and was resurrected? Because it was at PASSOVER, which is a Jewish holiday and the RCC wanted nothing to do with the Jews who killed Christ. I suggest you get reading about your Catholic Church and learn the truths about many things, including antisemitism. Thumb me down, it just proves the ignorance that is rampant among so many.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) What are your opinions on why this bishop of the catholic church would say that there were no jews gased <br>  <br>  He was raised by Nazi sympathizers.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) what is his motivation for saying this<br>  <br>  See above.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) is it because the catholic church was anti Semitic before the war saying the jews were what was wrong with the world<br>  <br>  No.  Do you have evidence of any such Roman Catholic Church statement?<br>  <br>  <br>  4) Is he trying to protect the church ?<br>  <br>  Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  <br>  It sounds to me as if this particular bishop were indoctrinated by Nazi sympathizers, probably his parents   He believes what he has been taught.

Some people believe we never landed on the moon too. I think the people who deny the gas chambers of WWII are afraid to admit that one man on earth could have as much power as Hitler did. It's easier for them to deny it and say it never happened than to face that horrific truth. But a wise man once said "those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it." It's better to face it head on and realize that it was a horrible thing that happened, than to deny it and just try to forget it ever did. We need future generations to know it happened, so that nothing like that could ever happen again.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Don't ascribe his views to the whole church, please.<br>  Many thousands of Catholics lost their lives sheltering Jews.<br>  <br>  He is one of a very few people in the world that are Holocaust Deniers.<br>  <br>  Maybe he thinks they were abducted by aliens.<br>  He is an idiot and does not reflect the attitude of the church, or any sane person.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Yes, there may have been anti-semitism in the Catholic Church before WWII, as there was in teh USA, but the atrocities of the Nazi regime caused the Catholic Church to realize that anti-semitism is to be condemned.|`|AA10034051	He is wrong.

gmrYDpPVaa	Personally, I believe that it depends on the type of file.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I disagree with music sharing, but I don't mind it very much.  I am especially sympathetic if the music in question is difficult to find -- for instance, I have come across several songs that I was unable to locate in stores such as iTunes, but still wanted a copy of.  In that type of situation, I do not feel bad or guilty about downloading the music instead of purchasing it -- I would have purchased it if I could.  When others download music, I also don't mind very much.  <br>  <br>  However, there are times that I think people are too excessive with it.  It's not just the billionaire's pockets -- it's the pocket of the artist, who gets no sleep on tours, spends long hours in studios trying to make things better and being critiqued, and despite a high profile, has many things that we take for granted in our every day lives.  It's the man in the tech booth, it's the vocal coaches.  It's the musician's assistants.  It's the people that work in the factory the CDs are made in, or the people that work to bring you the best of music on sites like iTunes.  Others are correct in that bands don't make money from CD sales -- but they DO often make their money from online downloads.  And, the money may not be going directly to those that work in other parts of the sales process, such as factory workers or music techs, but the amount of money producers make will define how much they pay their employees.  One or two songs isn't bad, but when you're downloading thousands of dollars worth of music, it CAN take away on the long term scale from people that don't exactly have billions to spare.  <br>  <br>  <br>  When it comes to videos, I disagree with downloading them.  I believe that if you want to enjoy the fillm more than once, you should be willing to spend a few dollars at a video store to purchase your own copy.  However, I do not find it morally unacceptable to watch movies / stream movies online -- I do so all the time.  If I like what I see, I do buy it -- it's my way of testing a product before I decide to make a purchase.  Personally, I've saved a lot of money from it -- there have been a great deal of movies I nearly purchased but instead watched online the first time around -- and realized it wasn't worth my money to buy my own copy.  I don't consider it "stealing," as you could easily borrow a copy from someone to watch before making your own purchase.  However, I do believe that if you wish to enjoy a particular film more than once or twice, you should purchase a copy for yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Software, however, is a trickier slope.  We've all seen the twenty dollar software that does simple tasks -- and we've also all seen the thousands people will spend on the latest version of Adobe CS4 Suite, or Microsoft Office suites.  When it comes to that type of file sharing, I disapprove.  Would I judge anyone based on whether they download such things?  Probably not too much, but I would never do it myself and don't encourage others to.  I would be alright with it for testing, however, in this day and age, most software is available for a trial before a purchase, so it's unnecessary to download it to try it out.  <br>  <br>  One thing to beware of is that certain websites have, in the past, offered a downloaded version of software, with an activation key that belongs to someone else.  These keys were activated when the software was purchased, but the owner has not yet activated their software -- and in some cases, cannot do so if you use their activation key.  Fortunately, most sites have moved on to better methods of software download activation, but it's something to beware of -- I'm sure you'd hate it, too, if you purchased the latest copy of software only to be unable to use it because someone else stole your activation code.  <br>  <br>  It's also important to keep in mind that there ARE alternatives.  OpenOffice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office, GIMP Shop is a great comparison to Adobe Photoshop, etc. -- many items of software like this are available free and legally, at little sacrifice to quality.  If at all possible, I think it should be considered before downloading something that should technically be purchased.  <br>  <br>  <br>  All in all, I try to keep my downloading to a minimum.  If it's impossible to find music somewhere else, I don't feel bad about a download.  With films, I watch them online all the time, but have never downloaded any.  When I don't wish to pay for software, I use a legal freeware version of the same product type instead, and have never been let down by the alternatives.  That said, I don't mind when others download -- only when they do so excessively rather than work for what they want.|`|1GvzuVo1aa	It's not the question of whether it makes any difference for the billionaires. The fact is, you're performing an illegal activity and clearly stealing other person's work.

If wrong then it is sin for the Christian.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Personally, I disagree with the law. Sharing information is the beauty of the Internet. Also, how different is it from a teenager, say, from the 80's, copying songs onto a cassette for a friend to use in her Walkman? Still no harm done. <br>  Also, those movies that are copied from the Internet are usually poor quality; if a person wants a "perfect" copy, they can still go out and buy a copy at the store. But they shouldn't be penalized for getting a poorer copy online, especially since the movie industry would never charge people $20 for such a poor copy.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	No. Screw those corporate fat cats from RIAA that get like 90% of music sales revenue. We are in the economic recession right now. Can't afford to waste 23 bucks on a ridiculously overpriced CD.

RIAA makes the bulk of their money from CD sales.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Afraid god will smite you for not buying coldplay's latest album?|`|LqyOHY37aa	When you file share copyrighted media, you are taking money from the artists and from the retailers and from the employees who work for those retailers. Are people so cheap they can't afford to buy music? You spend hundreds on a computer, a big chunk each month for the internet, some on software to copy it, and media to store it on. Why not just skip all the expense and buy the music? Plus there is plenty of free to download files as well. <br>  <br>  BTW, some do get caught and they all say they didn't think they would and they payed through the nose for fees. Why risk it anyway?|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Yes it is theft of services, theft of intellectual property.  Think of it this way:  You agree to have a kid mow your lawn.  He does so, you are satisfied that the job is adequate, but you refuse to pay on the grounds that not only do you not gain any material from this transaction but that he is actually carting away the trimmings.  Of course you realize that that is wrong.  He's done something that you value, and worked hard at it, yet you decline to pay.<br>  <br>  That the record companies are heavily capitalized is beside the point, a cheap rationalization.  You are also failing to pay the singers, musicians, songwriters, producers, arrangers, mixers, etc. whose work you value.

We also didn't have the ability to star questions at that time.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, there were a lot more nasty trolls, and I never let my children look over my shoulder when I was on Y!A because there was almost always at least one R rated picture being used as an avatar along with sexually explicit questions and user names. It's because of it that I stopped visiting Y!A for several months, but when I returned they had started using a lot more checks and balances to reduce inappropriate behavior.<br>  <br>  Roaming games were quite common, so you never knew if people were really being serious or if it was a roaming game. The WSIDR  took up about every other question on the R&S board and there were a few nasty incidents where a user would tell people they were dying just to start drama and get sympathy. Since people couldn't really report other users, it was uncommon for anyone to get Q&A or accounts deleted, so when trolls started getting deleted, the "I'm dying" sob stories were replaced with "I've had it with this place, and I'm never coming back" rants. <br>  <br>  Another funny thing that went on because Y!A was so new was the countless newbies (everyone was a newbie back then) who would post questions like "What came first, the chicken or the egg?"<br>  <br>  I think Y!A and R&S in particular is a much better place to be now...thank goodness!|`|AA11212224	I think I've been here for three years, on and off, though I have to take breaks sometimes.<br>  <br>  What was going on here?

q7z7Ni3Daa	Yes, each could be replaced by a clause except possibly A.. <br>  <br>  Sentence A doesn't make any sense to me. In this sentence, only teachers can hope, so this clause needs to be near the word "teachers." Yet, "which" can't refer to students since it only refers to things not people. If I ignore the lack of meaning for me, the full (non-reduced) clause would be <br>  <br>  A) College teachers, who hope to enroll students whom others have ignored, don't go to high school.<br>  <br>  B) In the game, those kind of enemies make air units attack each other, which creates chaos among enemy ranks.<br>  <br>  c) Alan revealed the tunnel position, which could be seen from one hundred meters away, which endangered the other prisoners.<br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  1) Could each "ing" clause be replaced with a relative clause? Yes, except A, as I discussed before.<br>  <br>  2) In the last sentence, did the writer use a writing style not to repeat a relative clause twice? It is definitely probable since the style is awkward with two different uses of "which," one modifying a noun, and one modifying the sentence as a whole or Alan, depending on how you look at it. I would have moved the last "which" clause to the front though (even with the reduction) to reduce this confusion. (Endangering the other prisoners, Alan.....)

Since you so badly want to be a part of something.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	In the USA, Unitarians have been Unitarian Universalists since 1961. They are the oddest church around. They expect each person to make up his/her mind about the nature of God. This confuses, amuses and annoys Protestants, Catholics and Jews alike. You could think of them as a church for people who do not fit in a normal church.<br>  <br>  The Unitarians started out as Christians who did not believe in the Holy Trinity. They evolved. The Universalists started out as Christians who believed everyone goes to heaven, sort of like believing all caterpillars become butterflies. The analogy isn't exact because some caterpillars get eaten. The Universalists evolved too. The two merged in 1961.<br>  <br>  Agnostics are the most humble of any believers; they believe that the nature and existence of God is beyond human understanding. Atheists, by contrast, believe they know the answer to “Is there a God?”, and the answer is “No”. Jews, Christians and Muslims believe they too know the answer, and it is “Yes”. Hindus believe there is one God with many manifestations or many Gods, depending on how you look at it. I don’t know enough about their faith to explain it any better than that.<br>  <br>  Some Agnostics belong to UU congregations. Some Atheists, Theists and Deists do too. Not all UUs are agnostics and not all agnostics are UUs.<br>  <br>  In the USA, many people will use "Christian" to mean "Fundamentalist Christian", as in "I'm not Catholic - I'm a Christian". If you want to be accurate, Christians are followers of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ. They split off from the Jewish faith at the time of Jesus and have been splitting ever since. They have three main branches, Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant.<br>  <br>  Orthodox and Catholic split in 1054. Both claim to be the One True Church. The Orthodox are those Greek and Russian guys with square beards and icons. Catholics are the one with the Pope who lives in Rome. That is a gross simplification, and there are more countries involved.<br>  <br>  Protestants started splitting off from the Catholics with Martin Luther in the 1500’s. They include Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Baptists and hundreds more.  Episcopalians are Protestants. They split off from the Church of England shortly after the American Revolution. Methodists are Protestants. They were Church of England or Church of Scotland or Presbyterian until John Wesley came along; then they started following him.<br>  <br>  Fundamentalist Christians, the ones people sometimes mistakenly mean when they say “Christian”, believe they have gotten back to the fundamental beliefs of Christianity. Their services tend to be plain, their ministers don’t wear fancy stuff (The Pope, by contrast, has silk robes and a crown, like a king, only bigger, although he doesn’t wear it every day) and they read the Bible a lot. They tend to be conservative in their politics.<br>  <br>  All of this is brief and simple. You can read Wikipedia articles about everything I mentioned, if you are interested. I see I skipped the beliefs.<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholics believe the Pope is like a King of the church, sort of. The Cardinals are princes and the Bishops are dukes. (Again, this is a gross simplification.) Their priests don't marry. They believe the communion wine becomes blood and the wafer becomes flesh. <br>  <br>  Protestant and Orthodox priests can marry. The Orthodox churches all have popes, one per country, more or less. He is called a Patriarch. Protestants don't have Popes, although some have a head bishop or a president of the denomination.<br>  <br>  Some Protestants will argue over things that seem silly to outsiders, like whether it's OK to play the piano in church, or if you can baptize in water that isn't flowing. (Like a lake instead of a river.)<br>  <br>  Disclaimer: I've been a UU since 1974. I'm not a religious scholar, nor am I a minister.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Unitarian Universalists beleive that all paths and traditions lead to the same place and hold same value. I am pagan and a Unitarian Universalist. I am not required to beleive in a specific dogma or doctrine. I can appreciate what other traditions and paths bring to the table and still disagree. At the UU church I attend I sit with agnostics, atheists, christians, jews, and pagans.<br>  <br>  **ADD**<br>  Actually Unitarian Universalists origins are Christian in nature. For whatever reason, they are still listed as a Christian Church.|`|AA11521494	Unitarians do not believe in the holy trinity - hence "unity".<br>  Episcopalian is a sort of halfway house between catholic and protestant and hence is very liberal on the whole as it can seem to believe almost anything.  Methodism is an offshoot of it that started in England in the 18th century when the episcopal church (known as anglican here in the UK) really wasn't doing its job, so one of its priests went preaching around the country and accidentally started a new denomination.<br>  Christian includes catholic, episcopalian, methodist and all the other kinds of protestant.<br>  Agnostic is not a religion at all - just an admission that you don't know whether god exists or not.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Episcopalians are closest to Catholics; as a matter of fact, some people call them "Catholic Lite".  If you went to an Episcopal service, you would see that all the responses are the same.  Also, they do Communion every service just as Catholics do.  The difference is that they don't believe the Bishop of Rome is superior to other Bishops and you can believe in transubstantiation like Catholics do, but if you don't you're not considered wrong.  Episcopal priests can marry and have families, too.  And saints are to be learned about as examples of well-lived lives, but they don't pray to them.  Confession is a community prayer that is part of the Eucharist, but if you feel the need to confess to a priest or seek advice, you can do that, too.<br>  <br>  "Christian" is not a denomination.  It encompasses Catholic and Episcopal and Orthodox and the several hundred other Protestant forms of the religion.  Methodists broke from the Episcopalians.  They are similar but less formal in worship style.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	Unitarian and Episcopalian lean toward being more liberal. <br>  <br>  Agnostic is not a religious group.<br>  <br>  Christian can not be referred to as a sub-group of it's own self.  <br>  <br>  There are liberal and conservative Methodist churches.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	Unitarian is not a Christian religion and off course Agnostics are not either.

Workers of iniquity are the one's who pretend wolves in sheeps clothing, the put on the aire of God but don't have the Lord in their life as they claim too, they don't know him because they don't care too.|`|AA10332151	I consider Mat 7:15-23 to be one of the most disturbing passage in the entire Bible. Who are these people that will say on that day "Lord, Lord" after all didn't they ....<br>  <br>  1) prophesy in Jesus name?<br>  2) drive out demons in Jesus name?<br>  3) perform many miracles?|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	Through prayer and study of HIs word.|`|WbkAMabLaa	I believe these people who did all these thing in Jesus name but yet Jesus still said Go for I never knew you, were religious people who did all the right christian stuff, talked a good talk and all that yet in their private time they didn't even care about God. They didn't truly know Him! Many people put on a good act to look good and to feel as if they are saved by going to church and all, but really have no relationship with Jesus, don't spend time with Him, and yet they think that their going to church and their good deeds will get them through to heaven....What a lie Satan is telling them!|`|oFiStmkGaa	The answer is quite simple: have a relationship with Yahweh, through Yahshua (Jesus)! That's basically all that God really wants, a loving familial relationship like one has with their parents, one based on love and trust. What Matthew 7:23 is saying is that many people proclaim to know God but in fact do not know Him on a personal level. These people are those that are in it for personal gain in terms of money, power and glory, whereas God wants us to walk with Him out of love for Him.<br>  <br>  Matthew 7 is also about hypocrisy, people who profess to follow God but actually do not. The word "iniquity" is also profound because it basically means transgression of God's Law, also called the Torah. And in Matthew 5:17-20 Yahshua confirms that the Torah is NOT abolished.<br>  <br>  And how do we know someone is a child of God and loves God? 1 John 5:1-5 has the answer: "Everyone who believes that Yahshua is the Messiah is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. This is love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Yahshua is the Son of God."<br>  <br>  Those who love Him are those who keep His Commands. So how do we literally follow the Torah which is practically impossible to keep? Through inward observance (Romans 2:28-29) and walking in the Fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:16-26)! Note: by inward observance I mean we must trust and understand the spiritual (and prophetic if any) importance of the Torah, even in obscure passages.<br>  <br>  And here is my final word: Romans 13:8-10 "Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. The commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: "Love your neighbor as yourself." Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law."|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	God makes himself known to all of us, many choose to reject him as their Lord. So he will tell you, to depart from his presence.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	Please read the verse again.  It says that God will profess he "never knew you".  It saying nothing about if anyone knew him.|`|P5rczL0Saa	By believing that Jesus died for our sins, and accepting Him as our Savior. You will be given the Holy Spirit (God living in us). God Bless|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	You can know God in silence. Many people are so busy talking, listening to noise which they call music.and are distracted by other things in life that they never are silent enough to listen to his voice in their heart and mind. I spend a few hours every day in silence, alone except for God. I listen and he speaks, I answer and he listens.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	We never "know" God entirely.  He's infinite and we're finite.  We grow in our knowledge of Him every day. (We hope.)<br>  <br>  But notice something:  This verse doesn't talk about us knowing God.  It says "I never knew you".  It's talking about God not knowing us.<br>  <br>  To me, that speaks volumes about our free will.  If we choose to hate instead of love, hurt instead of heal, judge instead of bless, we close ourselves off from God to the extent that even in His omniscience He doesn't recognize us any more.

I have had a<br>  very definite thinning to where I have a wider separation when I give<br>  myself a semi part to one side, or down the middle. The texture of<br>  my hair has become very fine as well. I used to have very thick volume aand<br>  thick textured hair strands. And it all changed when I became a<br>  Diabetic. Now it's hard to guess, whether the severe change is due to<br>  old age, where thinning is very common, or if it's a combination of both<br>  that and the Diabetes. I worry about Male Pattern Baldness as I sure<br>  am seeing the signs of it's beginning. I see many women in public<br>  with this same disorder.

NWnOTkwCaa	Okay, God doesn't hate anyone. We are all born selfish, thoughtless, and in rebellion against God. The Bible was written by men inspired by God. It rings true because it is true. God accepts us the way we are but that doesn't mean He wants us to stay that way. Why are you so angry?|`|5AbCtkWFaa	I'm going to take a leap of supposition here and pretend there really is a god.  Now, let's say that men mistranscribed and mistranslated bits of the bible.  It's also quite possible that "god" created gays as a test--not to them, but to his followers.  And it's clear that if this is so, then many Christians have failed miserably.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	People hate because they are ignorant.<br>  <br>  I hate nobody. Some people make strong statement to show how much they don't hate, but deep down they really do. Listen to these coded messages often heard from those insisting that they don’t really hate gays and lesbians.<br>  <br>  LOVE THE SINNER, HATE THE SIN: That's just coded language for I still hate you. If you truly love the sinner, you will accept him/her regardless of that individual's characteristics or behavior. Read that parable in Matthew about the complaining about your neighbor's splinter when you have a timber in your eye.<br>  <br>  I HATE SIN: No, if you want someone to change you really hate the sinner. Homosexuality between consenting adults is a victimless activity that has no bearing on you. Love is unconditional.<br>  <br>  I DISAGREE WITH THEIR CHOSEN LIFESTYLE: First, being gay is not a lifestyle and it isn’t chosen. No, you really hate them and want them to conform to your world view.<br>  <br>  HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN: No it is not. Jesus never spoke to the concept of sexual orientation or homosexuality.<br>  <br>  JUST BECAUSE I DON’T AGREE WITH THEIR SIN DOESN’T MAKE ME A HATER: Yes, it does. You’re in denial As long as an individual is not causing you or anyone else harm, live and let live without judgment.<br>  ----------<br>  True LOVE accepts every individual as is. Love is UNCONDITIONAL.<br>  <br>  As Auntie Mame says, "Darling, I disapprove of absolutely nothing."|`|gbeTKHYkaa	it is not a sin to be a homosexual. it is a sin to ACT upon it.

CQz8dMzFaa	There were major crossfires going on near my house for the last two days. I heard gunshots all day, people died. There were also fears that we might get hit inside the house, and we were preparing to hide in the basement. I was on my periods, last day of them. I'm a Muslim, and salat(routine prayers) are not allowed then, as it is unclean(any liquid/gas from the lower area, by man or woman, during salat, nullifies it). Normal prayers, like Allah help me, etc are allowed, but I feel closest to Him when I do salat. <br>  I was so desperate today, that I did it, and I demanded God to help us. And He did. Who else could?<br>  <br>  I didn't pray to Jesus or Muhammad (pbuth), just God, their and our Creator.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Faith and trust in God<br>  <br>  <br>  God said it, I believe it and that settles it.|`|rWP4suXuaa	Faith in christ jesus is the true faith...and he only answers prayers according to his will as the bible speaks of.<br>  <br>  <br>  God loves you...God bless|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	True faith and trust in God is knowing that God is always there,forever surrounding us.God is exalted and powerful in all ways.He can do miracles and if we lay our lives around by putting Him first He will give you blessing.He's a miraculous Lord who shields us from harm.He shields us with his love and favor.Nothing but glory shall be poured on us.Trusting God is believing that when the path is crooked He will make it straight.Although Satan is below God he certainly does try to get us to believe that his ways are right by following the world.God does defiantly help emotions,When we become a born again christian we need to surrender and repent to God.Remember that Jesus is the one who died on the cross for our sins.When we were born we were not righteous but when we give out life to God we are forgiven for every sin that was made.Jesus is God.Jesus is the son of the living God.Jesus is God who was made into man.Jesus could do whatever His Father told Him to do.The same power God has so does Jesus.We can have those powers if we have faith,believe in him,bless Him,bless His people,pray for His people,give our tithes miracles shall happen.|`|FMOFA8ckaa	well i call myself a believer in christ.<br>  because i know hes out there i have no doubt in my mind, i pray every night because i believe he is all powerful and can do all things.<br>  and yes satan believes in him, but doesn't worship him and he thinks hes better than him. its a good question, you should ask a local pastor, they'd be happy to answer for you i bet. <br>  but were not asked to belive in him, its our choice.|`|BRNNVcMOaa	Trusting in Him your LIFE and that He will meet all of your needs.<br>  God knows you (created you) you must completely trust in Him. Trust God with you life (soul,spirit,body, everything) and the rest will fall into place.|`|EVSwa73Caa	Jesus tell us that he is the light, the truth and life no one comes to the father but by Him. He also mentions that if we follow his word ask anything to the Father under his name and it should be done.<br>  <br>  so when you are praying you should pray to the father under Jesus name (for the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one).<br>  <br>  putting that aside:<br>  <br>  true faith and trust in God starts with obedience. In other words our sinful nature is what keeps us a way from God so we have to change our sinful ways (completely: attitude, habits, language, and so on). Second you must believe in him and repent from all your sins and never turn back to them or turn your self in to new ones. Third you need true worship with all your heart. True worship doesn't start when you get to church true worship starts when you first wake up in the morning. In other words you need to pray, sing to the Lord and read your bible constantly. This also includes fasting and studying the Word of God. Last you need to give him your heart ( a two minute prayer is just not enough) by opening your self up and praying with all your heart. You also need to learn how to pray (think about others first and then your self) and do good deeds. you must always seek Gods will and ask for his will on everything you do.<br>  <br>  When you take all these things and give them all you got then God will do the rest and show you his great power.<br>  <br>  Pray and give your heart to the Lord. God Bless|`|KPNOQAP4aa	faith is being certain of what we do not see. we believe that God exists and he makes it easy to belive in him because he is always sharing and working in our lives as Christians.<br>  <br>  its a relationship between Creator and created, so it's not exactly explainable. but you can think of it in terms of: husband and wife, father and child, master and apprentice, and friend to friend. but it's kind of all of those put together...also diety to human, which is kind of obvious.<br>  <br>  God is all those things to us and more, because he is our Hero and our Salvation as well as our Creator, Father, Lover of our souls, and best friend!<br>  <br>  the Bible says in the Lord's Prayer that we are to adress our prayers to God [our Father in heaven] and ask what we do in his son's name [In Jesus' Name, Amen] <br>  that reminds us each time we pray that we are created by God and Jesus is our link to him because of the sacrifice he became for our sins.<br>  <br>  i hope that helps! keep growing in God!|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Hi, Mary.  Respectfully, I think your concept of prayer is too limited.  It isn't about asking for stuff.  It isn't about giving God enough "true faith" so that in return, he meets a certain number of your needs with miracles.<br>  <br>  * Asking God for stuff is good, but remember:  He gave you a brain, hands, arms and legs to use to meet your own needs.  I don't think God does stuff for us that we can do for ourselves.<br>  <br>  *  Prayer is more about that connection with God.  Some of my best prayer is nothing more than sitting quietly for as long as I can and focusing on God.  No thoughts.  No words.  No asking or telling him anything.  Just being.<br>  <br>  *  Faith is knowing that God loves you and will give you everything you need to make your own wishes come true.<br>  <br>  *  Jesus is God.  He is God the Son in human form.  There is also God the Father and God the Holy Spirit.  They're all 3 one God.|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	Pastor Yongi Cho who leads the biggest church in the world (in South Korea) said simply "I pray and I obey"

LoGsuxCLaa	Its a tricky one.<br>  <br>   I myself don't think parents should hit their child. Ever. doesn't that just teach the kid that violence can solve problems?  <br>  <br>  I know the way kids are is not always the parents fault, and some kids are just brats. But i always think parents should control the situation, before they need to use violence against the kid.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, i do see what you mean. Kids suing their parents over nothing is ridiculous. But i guess that's a small price to pay, for the laws with have that protect some children from violence.<br>  <br>  <br>  "A survey in Britain showed that most adults are afraid of teenagers these days.<br>  Very sad."<br>  <br>  But that's probably the medias fault.<br>  <br>  You can't turn on the news without seeing a report about teenaged yobs causing trouble. I dont think we can blame the teenagers if someone is scared of them before knowing them.<br>  <br>  I am sometimes a victim of this nonsense. I sometimes find myself judging teenagers who dress a certain way, and i sometimes cross the road if i see some 'hoodies' ahead of me,  because i have believed the BS in the media, and im actually scared of some of my peers, and I believe i may be attacked by someone i dont even know. But, isnt that my problem? i'm the one being prejudice, and judging someone on the way they look. Those 'chavs' who ive judged were the victims there. they were discriminated against by me. <br>  <br>  no wonder some teenagers end up becoming criminals. they must feel like outcasts if hey are judged on their apperance by people like me all the time.<br>  <br>  To answer the question: should it be illegal to your kid? i think so..<br>  <br>  Should parents go to jail or be prosecuted for very minor acts of violence to an out of control child, probably not.<br>  <br>  *shrugs* I dont know whos to blame. or how to solve these problems.|`|Yi7AR18qaa	There are many different parenting techniques that can be used to effectively discipline a child that do not involve physical hitting. Parents should consider parenting classes if they do not know how to properly raise a child.|`|1JtnI4SEaa	Part of it is lazy parenting...parents want to be their kids friend and not act like a parent.|`|IngripgMaa	Yes.|`|7HGPaUwIaa	The government make it harder for parents to discipline their children. Look at the society we live in, thanks to the government, you can say nothing to a 15 year old thug who hangs out outside your house drinking and swearing at all hours without risking your life. Knowing full well that the thug could kill you and get community service...<br>  Parents should be allowed to discipline their children, by hitting them if necessary, the same way teacher should also be allowed. <br>  Look at the way teenagers behave in schools...teachers are in fear of weather they will be stabbed, shot...having to suffer abuse from students because they are powerless...<br>  The government have a lot to answer for where the upbringing of our children is concerned.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Yes|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	There's a big difference between a spanking and a beating--between the dragging of a kid in a tantrum across the slick tile of the supermarket and dragging him across the hot asphalt in the parking lot.  No one is interfering in the parenting until it's abusive.  Until that point, how the child is raised is solely the responsibility of the parents.  Kids are the way they are today because of the parents.  I don't know about the UK, but in the US they stopped giving grades because it makes kids feels bad.  They stopped keeping score in young sports leagues because it makes the kids feel bad.  The parents won't let their kids be suspended in school because it singles them out and makes them have to take responsibility to stay home from work or get a babysitter.  Forget that their kid hasn't learned a lick of courtesy or other social graces.  <br>  <br>  Kids need to feel occasional shame, disappointment, "bad" in order to learn coping skills.  The older they get without encountering life's little ups and downs, the more entitled they start to feel and behave and the more "tragic" it that now they can't get into a good school, can't find a good job, can't keep a good job, etc.<br>  <br>  So it all starts with the parents.  The one's raising the kids, and the one's raising them so wrongly that these feel-good rules crop up and shelter the little future heathens.

[3:19]<br>  <br>  Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a Religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with Allah."  [6:161] <br>  <br>  Who can be better in Religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.

[3:83] Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)." [3:84]  If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good). [3:85]<br>  <br>  And thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds, [110:2]  Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy). [110:3]  <br>  <br>  The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.

Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).

SzqeeUxgaa	Yes, there are similarities between Islam and Christianity, as Christianity is the religion which follows Bible. bible was revealed on Jesus (p.b.u.h.) and we muslims respect him highly... BUT Bible is not the final book, rather Quran is the final book which was revealed on Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) thus ISlam is the final religion.<br>  <br>  You will find many changes and versions of Bible, but there is not a change of a single word in the Holy Quran as Allah has promised in this book to guard his book as now no book will be revealed and no prophet would ever come. Islam is the final religion.<br>  <br>  Feel free to ask more, but beware of the anti muslims, trolls and misguided ones.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/dir/?link=list&sid=396546509">http://answers.yahoo.com/dir/?link=list&...</a>|`|AORcLwTNaa	i dont think u would be offending people<br>  anyways<br>  here are some things about islam that are quite interesting<br>  and if u have any specific questions, email me<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  so what does Islam really stand for?<br>  here goes:<br>  <br>  -we believe that Allah is the One and Only God and that Muhammad [peace be upon him] is the last Messenger<br>  -we pray five times a day               <br>  -Concern for and almsgiving to the needy<br>  -fasting the entire month of Ramadan<br>  -and if your stable enough, going to Saudi Arabia for hajj at least once in your lifetime<br>  -we believe in the Holy Quran, which has remained the same since the time of the Prophet, letter by letter, verse by verse<br>  -we believe in Angels<br>  -we believe in Qadr, or Destiny<br>  -we believe in Prophets<br>  -we believe that the Day of Judgment is coming<br>  <br>  -we believe in the Hereafter<br>  -and life after death<br>  -we believe in peace<br>  -and having morals and showing modesty<br>  -that man is not greater than woman<br>  -we believe in respect to all human beings, WHATEVER race or religion they are<br>  -we believe in Abstinence<br>  -Islam teaches you to think and reflect<br>  -85% of muslims are not even arab!!<br>  -many verses in the Quran are about science, and 1400 years ago, knowing this stuff would be impossible!<br>  -islam teaches that we are here to worship our Creator, in all our actions<br>  -we give 2.5% of our excess wealth to "zakat" , which helps the needy<br>  -islam is colorblind, so there is no race superior to another<br>  -there is no cleregy, and there is no one between you and your Creator<br>  -as long as your parents tell you to do something that is not conflicting with islam, you must obey them, as it is a great sin not to<br>  -neighbors should be treated kindly<br>  -even animals have their rights in Islam, and should be treated properly<br>  -we believe that this life is a test<br>  -not even muslims have a free ticket to paradise, and we must earn it<br>  -each person will be judged for their intentions and their actions<br>  <br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT ISLAM IS REALLY ABOUT YOU SHOULD BASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT ON WHAT IT REALLY TEACHES, NOT THE ACTIONS OF THOSE WHO ARE MISGUIDED, AND THOSE WHO ARE ONLY MUSLIM BY NAME<br>  <br>  DELETE EVERYTHING YOU HEARD FROM THE MEDIA<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -nearly 8 million muslims live right here in the united states, if islam really taught violence, then where is the violence?<br>  -for the majority of the Muslims, you dont see the violent actions, those who are trying to take the verses out of context are to serve their own purpose, so all the "kill all the infidel" stuff is nonsense<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THINK ABOUT IT3<br>  <br>  [credits to baba ali for alot of this. youtube.com search ummahfilms]|`|5ofS2qQYaa	Oh!

If you see it as the right and true way, as more than 1.5million people around the world do, then do it for yourself<br>  <br>  we're not put on earth to please other humans...we're here to worship God and that is the only concept we should worry about<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Peace|`|khdFNlJ7aa	the main difference in Islam and Christianity is that Muslims do not Believe that Jesus is God, but Gods Holy Messenger and beloved prophet. Ok, and Allah is the same God they talk about in the Bible, but Allah is just the Arabic name for him. If you read the Quran you will know that alot of the stories are the same. Adam and Eve, they talk alot about Abraham. They even tell you more details of the stories. Like Satan was cast out of heaven for not bowing to Adam, God's Creation. Satan said "You made me out of fire, and him out of clay, I am superior so no I will not bow down"  Ok, you should read the Quran, then you will know more about these stories they talk about in the Bible aswell.|`|uBxvR6FJaa	Take the “Islam - Is it right for me?” Test.<br>  Don’t worry - it’s an easy True/False test.<br>  Answer the following honestly:<br>  <br>  1) Muhammad, the only one who could hear Allah speaking to him, received personal, often sexual and tailor-made advantages that applied specifically and uniquely to him (33:37-38, 33:50-53). Muhammad used the Quran to control his wives during his life (33:30-33) and even after his death (33:53). He told his wives that they will burn in hell if they betray him (66:3-5, 66:10).<br>  Muhammad was incorruptible and his motives were pure - Yes / No<br>  <br>  2) Muhammad was a warlord (Quran, Ch. 8 “Spoils of War”). He promised his soldiers booty and spoils of war (48:19-20) if they conquer Khaybar and Makka. The Jewish tribe Banu Qurayza betrayed Muhammad. Some of them (the men) were slain, others (the women) were captured (and sold into slavery) and Muhammad’s men took their land, houses and wealth (33:26-27). Muhammad was given permission to marry women who were made widows by his advancing army (33:50).<br>  Muhammad was a “messenger of peace” - Yes / No<br>  <br>  3) Apparently, being a prophet of Allah is not fully satisfying. Muhammad’s life-work was so unfulfilling that he needed more than one wife in order to feel complete. He was on the most important mission in history but he still had so much spare-time that he was able to marry many wives. During his practice of polygamy, Muhammad married his ex-daughter-in-law, his first-cousin, women whom he considered “spoils of war”, women for whom he had payed dowries and any woman who “gave herself to the Prophet” if he desired her (33:37, 33:50). In addition to his wives, Muhammad was allowed to marry slave-women whom his “right hand possessed” (33:52). This is the man who said that we should care about God alone because all of our sexual desires will be fulfilled in the afterlife.<br>  Muhammad, a holy man, “needed” all those wives - Yes / No<br>  <br>  4) The Quran is full of sexism (4:34, 2:223, 2:282, 12:28) and it allows men to use emotional and physical punishment to discipline their disobedient wives (4:34).<br>  As the Quran says, men are “a degree above” women (2:228) - Yes / No<br>  <br>  5) The Quran claims that, except for a few, all Jews are treacherous (5:13) and “listeners of falsehood” who are “greedy for illicit gain” (5:42). The worst enemies of the believers are the Jews and the idol-worshipers (5:82). Jews and Christians are only friends to each other (5:51).<br>  Allah needs to use stereotypes in order to simplify a complex world - Yes / No<br>       <br>  6) Allah takes credit for “natural” events such as lightning (13:13) flight (16:79) shooting stars (67:5) and earthquakes (16:15). The Quran says that the night sky is used to “veil” daytime (7:54) and that sperm comes from between the backbone and ribs (86:7).<br>  The Quran is a modern, scientific book - Yes / No<br>  <br>  7) Allah could have banned slavery outright in the Quran, but left the issue up to Muslims to interpret as they saw fit. The result? Muslims practiced slavery (30:28), as well as sexual-slavery (23:6, 70:30), victimizing tens of millions of people, for over a thousand years. Muslims made it easy to find non-believers to enslave. They designated areas in Africa in which they would not preach Islam - so that slaves captured there would not turn out to be fellow Muslims. The Muslim’s most holy country, Saudi Arabia, did not ban slavery until 1962.<br>  God would allow his believers to own slaves - Yes / No<br>  <br>  End of Test.<br>  <br>  If you marked “No” for ANY of the preceding questions, Islam is NOT right for you.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Your personal beliefs are your personal beliefs, and you don't have to broadcast them to the world.<br>  <br>  Islam is very satisfying for many people as they perceive it to provide answers to many many questions - I personally don't like and don't believe in Islam, and i have studied it closely, but everyone is different, and you have to do what is right for you.<br>  <br>  Have you looked at ANY other faith systems? Philosophy? Natural science? So many things go to make up a person;s outlook on life... it is as well to check them all out over time.<br>  <br>  Be aware of getting sucked into something and losing all your critical faculties, there are good and bad things about Islam, The community aspect is good, and supportive, the "ummah right or wrong" attitude, and the permanent victimhood attitude is very very tiring, and I would counsel you not to fall into that trap. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a belief system where you don't have to work things out for yourself and take personal responsibility then Islam is for you, it tells you how to do everything, including going to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  There are other monotheistic faiths other than Islam, and even christian like faiths that don't have a belief in the Trinity (unitarians, they're not christians).<br>  <br>  Islam is intruiging because it is different, it is  a 6th century Arabian belief system cobbled together from tribal lore, some judaic and christian stories, in order to patch together a divided tribal land. <br>  <br>  Muslims feel they're special and their ummah demands a respect from others that they are not prepared to give.  Islam is , as I said above, a belief system, not a fact, if you bear nothing else in mind, bear that.<br>  <br>  It's about as divine as my cat's litter tray, imo, but if you want to learn more, get some books, read the Qur'an, read the Hadith, watch who you get involved with on line there are some very dodgy sources.

Particularly aggravating to the Romans, the Christians refused to accept that the Roman Emperor himself was divine.

You have squares and rhombus'  and parallelograms, they all have a lot in common. Four sides angles but they are all a little bit different. Each is a valid solid shape. Some people like squares and some like rhomus' but they all like rectangles. If that makes sense. I feel spirituality is the base of all religion.

No one is good but God alone." <br>  <br>   (John 5:19, The Son cannot do anything at his own pleasure, he can only do what he sees his Father doing."<br>  <br>   (Matthew 3:16, 17) "This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved."<br>  <br>   (Mark 15:34, JB) "My God, my God, why have you deserted me?"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is something that you can use to counteract trinity proof text <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_08.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/article_0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/start.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/ti/start.htm</a><br>  <br>  True Christianity is monotheistic and no one has ever been ever to prove any true contradictions after a close study of the bible<br>  <br>  And no matter how much you believe you will never get it, people who believe the trinitarian lie can not ever explain their beliefs  because they don't make sense.

All three Persons of Trinity share one divine nature, and they are fully equal in status (the same way men and women are equal). You will have to become acquainted with some of the terminology and the shorthand that we use if you want to understand what we mean. For instance, when we say that Jesus is the Son of God, we're making a statement about his relationship to the Father. We're not saying that Jesus is (ontologically) less than the Father.<br>  <br>  2) When we say that "God is infinite," we mean that God has existed eternally (to use the traditional formula, "there was never a time when God was not"). To say that God exists as three persons doesn't contradict that. <br>  <br>  As for your question about Mary giving birth to Jesus, we certainly do NOT believe that Jesus' divinity came from Mary. The doctrine of the Incarnation presupposes that the Son existed prior to his conception in Mary, and that he got his humanity from Mary, not his divinity.

The question to ask is do you want to be more like them or with them? Being bi is being attracted sexually to both genders. Usually when people ask this question it's because they've met someone who has sparked their interest, an interest that they've never felt before. If you feel the same urges sexually with men as well as women, then chances are you're bi. If someone makes out with the opposite gender at bars or parties for attention then they're most likely just attention whores.|`|SE2xiEupaa	If you are sexually attracted to both males and females, there is a good chance that you are a bisexual.

71afbaedac2a285cf2c6b5606a092e32aa	If you want to let go of your mental bouncing from topic to topic to quiet it down you could learn to focus on your breathing.<br>  <br>  This form of meditation you can sit various ways, but the meditation itself is simply to "watch" your breath, for example as it enters and leaves your nose.  Your mouth should have your lips slightly apart and tongue at the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, lightly held to keep you from clenching your jaw.<br>  <br>  Then you watch the breath.  When a thought enters into it, say softly (and w/o judgement to yourself and/or the thought in any way) "THINKING" or "DISTRACTION" and return to the breath.<br>  <br>  You many never totally achieve a perfectly quiet mind, which is not the goal, but rather to see where thoughts rise up, are impermanent and often just a pest so that you can learn to not react in a knee-jerk fashion to anything with too much desire and clinging or, aversion, etc.  You'll learn to know where your weak spots are and how to gently let them GO.<br>  <br>  Don't force it, it will come with practice and compassion for yourself and others.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	There is no "right way" to meditate.  <br>  <br>  Successful meditation, like anything else, takes practice and patience.<br>  <br>  Focus on your breathing rather than the worldly thoughts.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

oMF6bXCZaa	I have brought up six children.  Two of them always had imaginary friends.  I encouraged it, because it was either a wonderful imagination or they really were seeing somebody that we couldn't see.  Since there was no harm to anybody, I went along with it.  Both are now grown with children of their own.  They are successful business men and their imaginary friends did them no harm whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Instead of squashing imagination, or whatever it may be, by putting fear into children, we should encourage them to use the wonder of their young minds.<br>  <br>  One answer has stated "demons".  What a sad outlook on life.  Fear and negativity, will never create happy, well children, it will only pass the fear onto them.<br>  <br>  It is entirely up to you.

You are creating patterns where they don't exist. Once you have a certain belief or idea about something, you will see "signs" of it everywhere. It is your mind. You're right, you're making something out of nothing. <br>  <br>  Do you talk about your father a lot with your son? Do you talk about that old couple that died? Children have active imaginations. They will also repeat what they are exposed to and what they hear from their environments. <br>  <br>  I suggest you check out this Wikipedia article: <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronici...</a><br>  <br>  This pretty much explains what you're going through.|`|gsTpQmGfaa	It sounds like poltergheist activity.

Maybe we really are in the end-times.|`|M8X0dIOZaa	Sometimes kids just have really active imaginations. I don't know any parent who hasn't boasted about something  strange happening that helped them save their child from being hurt or killed. Many things can be attributed to cooincidence. But if I were you I'd set these things aside in my head... keep them in mind and watch what happens, trying to be objective. And by all means do NOT share your suspicions with your son, it could encourage fanciful behavior and be a detriment to his development intellectually and socially. Be sure to emphasize what's true when he talks about people that are dead as if they are alive. Don't argue with him, but say things like "It's good you try so hard to remember your grandfather. I miss him too, but it's also good to know the difference between talking to him in your head and conversations that happen in real life. It's good to imagine things, but better to know that you imagined them, and they are not real." This will also give your son a chance to tell you the truth, whether he thinks he really talks to his grandpa, or if he really knows he's imagining it. Kids are usually smart enough by his age to know the difference, even if they don't admit it. Allowing them to talk like it's real makes them think it's ok to think it's real too, and that could slow him down intellectually and socially.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	These stories are common but as they get closer to 8 they "grow out of it".|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Take your kid to the nut house and have a shrink look at him.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Your son is smarter than you and having you on!

It might take a little getting used to the concept though.  I'm not sure about marriage because I eventually want to have kids of my own the good old fashioned way and it would take a lot for me to give that desire up.  Pre-op:  couldn't do it.  Nothing against pre-op transsexuals, but it would weird me out too much and I like vagina.  I would be pretty ticked if they didn't tell me fairly early on, especially if they were pre-op.  But I wouldn't resort to violence, which is no excuse under any circumstance.|`|CfZn9kK5aa	I would be upset that they didn't trust me enough to tell me.

The surgery doesn't make that 'man' a 'woman'. In fact, that male, has always been a woman, her body just didn't match her mind.|`|MCW5tHv3aa	resorting to violence for any reason is morally and legally wrong. <br>  <br>  as to the person.. talking about her medical history.. I personally feel that if you were to enter a committed relationship, that it's important to share personal history..|`|aWPmvPpfaa	no man, its cool to beat up women......|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	This is how I look at the situation:<br>  <br>  If a woman (that used to be a male) has had all the proper surgeries to secure her status as a woman (vaginal surgery, breast implants, removal of testicles and penis, hormone treatments) then I believe that she IS a woman and that her history as a man is simply a personal medical history that should have no bearing over the relationship.<br>  <br>  It's a little bit different with men that used to be women because at the moment, there is no surgery to replace a vagina with a penis. Male hormones can turn the woman's clitoris into a small penis, but it's usually more obvious than say, a transwoman's vagina.<br>  <br>  As long as she can pass for a woman in everyway possible, I really don't believe it's necessary to disclose the information... or at least not at first. Perhaps in due time if you want perfect honesty in the relationship.<br>  <br>  Now if we're talking about a guy "posing" as a woman and he hasn't transitioned, that's a completely different story.

rNXCnJ8Eaa	I really don't think this is going to work out. You want my honest opinion, you need to brace yourself for the fallout so you guys can possibly save the friendship when things go wrong.|`|dFBccLExaa	I've had issues with my man having sex drive. The main thing I can suggest you do is sit down and talk. Nothing will get resolved at the rate that it's going. Usually, there is something else that is causing it- whether it is depression, stress, or something that he's not talking about. So my guess is to start looking in those areas. Without communication, there won't be a solution, though. If you can't get talking on your own, I'd recommend a sex counselor to help you guys work through your issues. As these things need to be resolved for the relationship to be healthy.|`|wvJxtmJTaa	sex is not everything|`|2ywzcoVqaa	Sex isn't everything. My g/f & I will do it every day for awhile then cool off for a couple of weeks,then back to all the time. Sometimes just being close & cuddling is better than sex.|`|ErjWAn1iaa	I'll try to be brief...<br>  My wife and I just got back from Amsterdam where we celebrated our 10th year of Happy Marriage! Been together for 14. Bottom line, keep it light and FUN! Find common sexual interests and stay away from off the shelf solutions. Sex for us was boring and not frequent in the begining. As soon as we started to open up to some of our personal fantasies (after a few glasses of wine) WOW!!! Now we have fun. Being with the right sexual partner means constantly pushing the envelope of comfort and experinencing new things that are hot and crazy. We try to keep things fun but we have our regular "biological sessions" as well. That means, just take care of her then me and sleep. But at least once a week, we have a few drinks, and get a little crazy. You have to do new things and keep it fresh. Find out what excites him, but you shouldn't have to ask (hope you know what I mean). If you work on this you will have a happy relationship. It has changed ours for the better!|`|wZ8HmrA2aa	Maybe he wants the relationship to be more about how you feel about each other rather than how often you have sex. You probably mean more to him than all his previous flings.

That is those of the 144,000 mentioned at Revelation 14:1.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that the hope for most humans who have died is to be resurrected. The vast majority of the dead are to be raised to life as humans on a paradise earth.—Luke 23:43; John 5:28.<br>  <br>  A few humans have the hope of being resurrected to life in heaven. Their number is small—144,000 in all.  The 144,000 rule as immortal kings and priests with Christ. They have authority as judges. (1 Corinthians 6:3; Revelation 20:6) Are they babies who have died? No. They are followers of Christ who have been fully tested and tried!—Luke 22:28, 29.<br>  <br>  Consider, too, the contrast between dead humans and living angels. Whereas deceased humans “are conscious of nothing at all,” angels have full consciousness, feelings, and personal will. They are free moral agents. (Genesis 6:2, 4; Psalm 146:4; 2 Peter 2:4) The dead are described as “impotent,” or powerless, while angels are “mighty in power.” (Isaiah 26:14; Psalm 103:20) And while human descendants of Adam die as a result of sin and imperfection, God-fearing angels are perfect, enjoying a fully approved standing before Jehovah.—Matthew 18:10.<br>  <br>  The idea that angels are the souls of deceased humans might make for imaginative TV programs or movies, but that has  no support in the Scriptures. The Bible truths set forth above help us to avoid any misconception about the fate of our loved ones who die. And the Bible assures us that faithful angels—separately created, powerful servants of God—are superior to humans and are always ready to do Jehovah’s will. Happily, God’s will includes using the angels to watch over and assist those who sincerely respect Jehovah and seek to serve him.—Psalm 34:7.<br>  <br>  GOD’S human sons were not meant to die. (Romans 8:20, 21) But God’s Word gives a clear answer about what happens when we die: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Rather than being like a friend welcoming us to a better life, death is called “the last enemy,” according to the Bible, for it halts all of our activity. (1 Corinthians 15:26; Ecclesiastes 9:10) <br>  <br>  <br>  If accepting the bible in its entirety is what you plan to do that should point you in the right direction. We do sleep when we die. Good News About Death<br>  <br>  For millions of humans, death is like a sleep from which they will awaken. Jesus once said to his disciples about their friend who had died: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest, but I am journeying there to awaken him from sleep.” When Jesus was on his way to the memorial tomb, he met a crowd of mourners. On arrival at the tomb, he gave orders for it to be opened and called out: “Lazarus, come on out!” The man who had been dead for four days came out. (John 11:11-14, 39, 43, 44) Since Lazarus’ body was already decomposing, Jesus thus demonstrated that God can remember everything about the dead—their personality, their memory, and their appearance. He can make them live again. On another occasion Jesus said: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his [that is, Jesus’] voice and come out.”—John 5:28, 29.<br>  <br>  Providing us with further good news, the Bible states: “As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.” (1 Corinthians 15:26) And we will all live on a paradise earth|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Lover,<br>  JESUS said, "Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise."  This is also known as Abraham's Bosom when HE spoke about the rich man and Lazarus.

Dead is dead. There is no "soul" that goes out of the body to live elsewhere! No "soul" goes immediately to heaven or hell. Dead is dead!<br>  “For as the body without the spirit is dead, . .” [James2.26]<br>  <br>  The Sleep of Death.<br>  <br>  At death the body returns to dust and the life force (not the soul) to the creator<br>  “ . . . but the dead know not any thing, .” [Ecclesiastes 9.5]<br>  “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” [Psalm 146.4]<br>  Lazarus was dead four days, yet he gave no report of any “life after death” experience. (refer John 11.39)<br>  The Bible uses “sleep” as a figure of speech for death.<br>  Jesus said: “. . . Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; . . “ [John 11.11]<br>  David prayed “Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;” [Psalm 13.3]<br>  “And they stoned Stephen, . . . Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.“ [Acts 7.59-60]<br>  “. . . the fathers fell asleep, . . “ [2 Peter 3.4]<br>  <br>  “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: “ [Hebrews 9:27]<br>  <br>  The Hope of Resurrection – “Awake and Sing”<br>  <br>  Death is NOT the end. There is hope.  As there is a falling asleep, there is a waking up.<br>  <br>  “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: . . .” [Isaiah 26.19]<br>  “ . . . them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake . . . “ [Daniel 12.2]<br>  The next event that everyone will experience will be the resurrection, as John says, to face the results of his judgment.<br>  “And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. “ [John 5:29]<br>  Jesus said: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:” [John 11.25]<br>  <br>  What does it mean to “believe in Jesus”? – <br>  To believe that He is the ONLY source of resurrection life; that He paid the penalty for all of our sins when He dies on the cross and by His resurrection made possible our resurrection to eternal life; then by prayer we can invite Jesus into our lives and experience His resurrection power for daily living.<br>  <br>  The best way you can prepare for death is to get to know Jesus right now by prayer and Bible reading. You could pray this prayer right now –<br>  <br>  Father God in heaven, I am a sinner and I need your forgiveness; I believe that Jesus died for my sins; I want to turn from my sins; I invite Jesus into my heart and life. I want to trust Jesus as my Saviour, and to follow you as my Lord in the company of your Church; Lord please accept my prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Amen.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	I don't think time exists in the next life.  Time is given to us as a convenience for our limited understanding.<br>  <br>  The term "sleep" is a way to explain this to people who had no understanding of life without time.<br>  <br>  This is similar to the way that the bible says that the earth was created in 7 days.  In those days there was no concept of time, so the writer used the term "days" to meet the understanding of mankind.

I've always been a friendly person, and like you, have been walked upon several times. One day I woke up and put everything into perspective. I decided that I would only be friendly to the people I felt deserved my friendliness and that if others wanted to treat my bluntly or aggressively then I would treat them exactly the same way back. And hey presto! The aggressive ones had a lot more respect for me. I won't say I LOVE being blunt towards people, but I don't feel bad about it anymore, as I have learned throughout life that a lot of people don't feel bad about acting like this towards me (or plenty of others for that matter) so why should I feel bad? It hasn't exactly got me further ahead in life, but I feel a sense of satisfaction every single day from not allowing myself to be walked on. And of course I'm still the kind, caring person I always was towards the people who deserve it .

I felt so proud of my white heritage and what we have done for the welfare of other races, such as the blacks and jews.  I mean had we not in slaved them and brought them to america then we wouldn't be celebrating black history month.

ffb16e0ffc6a4152dbf3d94c25cd5995aa	Why do so many Christians believe revelation is dead? Because their churches have blinded them to what the Revelation says. People prefer to adhere to what their church is saying over what their Messiah is clearly telling them: " I Y'shua(Jesus), have sent my messenger to witness to you these matters in the assemblies. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star. " Revelation 22:16.<br>  <br>  And I don't have to tell you about the warning to His Church in the verses 18 and 19.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Wikipedia" is not the place to get Biblical information. <br>  <br>  And catholicism is totally false and unbiblical as well.  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal torment in hell (Galatians 1:6-9). <br>  <br>  The truth is that Revelation was complete in 90 AD, the last of the Books of the Bible to be completed.  And everything in chapter 6 and beyond is yet future on the earth.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	God's appointed leader is Jesus Christ.|`|FyBNITUlaa	He is not talking about the whole bible in the 19 he is specifically talking about adding to the book of Revelations.  This is the big controversy that people have with the Mormon church, they think that this is why we should not have the Book of Mormon, because they feel that we added to the bible when in all actuality it was in addition to.
ZOifSvNhaa	nothing <br>  <br>  <br>  *** w96 11/15 pp. 6-7 Does God Require Fasting? ***<br>  <br>  Both Catholic and Protestant churches recognize Lent, although the manner of observing it differs from church to church. Some eat just one meal a day during the full 40-day period preceding Easter. Others fast totally only on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. For some, Lent requires abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, and milk products.<br>  <br>  Lent is supposedly based on Jesus’ 40-day fast after his baptism. Was he then establishing a ritual to be followed yearly? Not at all. This is evident from the fact that the Bible does not record any such practice among the early Christians. Lent was first observed in the fourth century after Christ. Like many other teachings of Christendom, it was borrowed from pagan sources.<br>  <br>  If Lent is in imitation of Jesus’ fasting in the wilderness after his baptism, why is it observed during the weeks leading up to Easter—supposedly the time of his resurrection? Jesus did not fast during the days prior to his death. The Gospel accounts indicate that he and his disciples visited homes and ate meals in Bethany just a few days before he died. And he ate the Passover meal the night before his death.—Matthew 26:6, 7; Luke 22:15; John 12:2.<br>  <br>  There is something to be learned from Jesus’ fasting after his baptism. He was embarking on a vital ministry. The vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and the future of the entire human race were involved. This was a time for deep meditation and for prayerfully turning to Jehovah for help and guidance. During this time Jesus appropriately fasted. This indicates that fasting can be beneficial when done with the right motive and on a fitting occasion.—Compare Colossians 2:20-23.<br>  <br>  When Fasting Could Be Beneficial<br>  <br>  Let us consider some occasions today when a worshiper of God might fast. A person who has committed a sin may not feel like eating for a period of time. This would not be to impress others or be in anger at the discipline received. And, of course, fasting in itself would not straighten out matters with God. However, a truly repentant person would feel deep sorrow over having hurt Jehovah and probably friends and family. Anguish and fervent prayer for forgiveness may inhibit a desire for food.<br>  <br>  Israel’s King David had a similar experience. When faced with the prospect of losing his son by Bath-sheba, he concentrated all his efforts on praying to Jehovah to obtain mercy regarding the child. As his emotions and strength went into his prayers, he fasted. Likewise, taking food may not seem appropriate under certain stressful conditions today.—2?Samuel 12:15-17.<br>  <br>  There may also be times when a godly person wants to focus on some deep spiritual matter. Research in the Bible and Christian publications may be necessary. A period of time may be needed for meditation. During such an absorbing study session, an individual may choose not to be distracted by the eating of meals.—Compare Jeremiah 36:8-10.<br>  <br>  There are Scriptural examples of servants of God fasting when serious decisions had to be made. In Nehemiah’s day an oath was to be made to Jehovah, and the Jews would be liable to a curse if they broke it. They were to promise to put away their foreign wives and to keep separate from the surrounding nations. Before making this oath and during the confession of their guilt, the entire congregation fasted. (Nehemiah 9:1, 38; 10:29, 30) When faced with weighty decisions, a Christian may therefore go without food for a short period of time.<br>  <br>  Decision-making by bodies of elders in the early Christian congregation was sometimes accompanied by?fasting. Today, congregation elders faced with difficult decisions, perhaps in connection with a judicial case, may abstain from food while considering the matter.<br>  <br>  Choosing to fast in certain circumstances is an individual decision. One person should not judge another on this matter. We should not want to “appear righteous to men”; nor should we make food so important that it interferes with our caring for serious obligations. (Matthew 23:28; Luke 12:22, 23) And the Bible shows that God neither requires that we fast nor prohibits us from fasting.|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	asking silly questions|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	I believe in adding something.

Oh, and I wanted to add something.  The bible says that God chastises those whom He loves.  God's "chastisement" is unlike anything I've ever experienced on earth.  It's so pure and uplifting; He lets you know what you've done wrong, but it's never in condemnation, and there is always full restoration when you admit what you did wrong.

Bella's power could possibly keep any spells from working, so so long as she was in on the fight, the vampires would win hands down.  If she wasn't, then it really depends on how well the wizards know the vampire's weaknesses.  If they know that they are vulnerable to fire, then full body bind and light them on fire might work.  Assuming full body bind works on vampires.  But chances are, they wouldn't know.  Chances are, they would be trying Avada Kedavra, Stupify, Impedimenta, and other spells.  Not to mention that the vampires could easily dodge the full body bind curse if they saw it coming.  Which is likely.|`|ELSKfMpxaa	It would sort of depend on the attributes that they had.

I disagree most adamantly with much of what they say and stand for but, you are quite correct that some do automatically thumbs down someone just for being Christian.  I do not as a rule do that.

Why a massive rush to get it done before the winter solstice on Dec 21 2012 ....what's going on?|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Let me start from the beginning...<br>  The Mayans were an ancient civilization, and very advanced. They knew the world was round, the true length of the year, etc. Their specialty was astronomy. They were able to plot a calender up to thousands of years. Heck, they could even have kept going if they wanted to. Yet, they ended it on December 21th, 2012...<br>  Like most civilizations, the Mayans had their own religion and their own Gods. They believed that three worlds were created before ours. Each was destroyed because it's humans were defective. We've only lasted so long because are the true people, made out of maize, a sacred corn to the Mayan. They say the end of this world is (you guessed it) December 21th, 2012!<br>  Along with this, there's several other things happening in 2012. First off, the planets are going to put on a little show for us! A few planets are going to line up. Alas, this occurs at noon, so I don't know if we'll see it. There's also a possible reversal of Earth's magnetic field. Research for some more if you'd like.<br>  Now I'll inform you 'bout some past parallel prophecies. A notable one is Nostradamus, the most famous end-time prophet. He saw visions or premonitions, and tried his best to put them into words. True, they're not specifically linked to 2012. Apparently, a comet will come, coinciding with earthquakes and other natural disasters. Also mentioned is a conjunction of the planets. Some interpret the words to describe a polar shift. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Anyways, the Earth changes bring famine, drought, and social upheaval. Civilization will be changed. Continents will split apart with waterways. Powerful nations will be weakened.  The soical upheave will allow an antichrist to come to power.<br>  The Book of Revelation in the Bible is one of the best-known texts on end times.  It talks about seven seals/scrolls opening, each with an event happening. Then, four angels appear and release winds of destruction. They're told to hold back the winds until Christ puts a seal on the foreheads of 144,000 worthy servants of God who will not be touched by the destruction. This also tells of an antichrist who will achieve world domination. The antichrist will rule until the battle of the Armaggeddon. At this point, Jesus returns to Earth, the 144,000 are sent to heaven, and Christ destorys the armies of the antichrist, who is thrown into a lake of fire. As this happens to Earth, a war is in heaven as well. Angels fight Satan, who is also thrown into the lake of fire.<br>  Edgar Cayce has been told as one of the greatest prophets of all time. He said that the end time would come within the next generation of his period, meaning around 1958 and 1998. Of course, it didn't happen. His basic prophecy fits, but the only relation to time ending in 2012 is the possible polar shift. Here's some hightlights of his end-time prophecy: The Atlantis and Pacific coats of America will be altered. New York city, San Fransico, and Los Angeles will disappear. Russia will become the spiritual hope of the world. Intense Earthquakes will destory California and the Baja peninsula will diappear.  The Pacific ocrean will near Arizona and Nebraska. Mount Etna will erupt, signaling the sign of real changes. The Great Lakes will drain into the Gulf thorugh the Mississippi. Japan will go under sea. There will be a pole shift and ice caps will melt, meaning flooding. And new lands will rise out of the ocean, along with lost lands such as Atlantis.<br>  Now let's go to the Skeptic's Corner! There are several problems with 2012 predictions. Many do not come with dates and are vague. If a prediction does come with a date, it turns out to be wrong. What's the purpose of a prediction? Like Nostadamus. Many of his predictions are realized to be true until after it's happened. Useful, huh?  The theory of the pole shift is an application of bad science. Have you heard of self-fullining prophecies? A child spills milk on himself, and thinks of himself as accident-prone. Then, several more accidents happen since he damaged his self-confidence. The prophecy is fulfilled. Remember this with 2012.<br>  In case you do indeed believe that the world could end in 2012 and you're scared, here's a bit of advice. It's no accident that you were born in this specific time of history. You were born ot be here. Perhaps you're meant to see the world as it ends. How do you know if this is true? Well, asking about 2012 is the first sign! <br>  I hope I've explained this all well enough.

Now it's wormed its way into popular culture. Go figure.|`|BhzCW1rYaa	Who first came up with it ??? Well considering that the 2012 prediction has been found to be very wide spread, who knows... The Mayans, the Chinese, the Hopi Indians, the Egyptians, the Dogon Tribe in Africa, and there are many more around the globe who, in ancient times were able to predict the Galactic Alignment with such accuracy, the mind boggles...<br>  <br>  Anybody who tries to compare Y2K with 2012 is misinformed, Y2K was never a doomsday prediction (neither is the end of the Mayan Calender) Y2K was a possible computer malfunction, it was thought that the clocks might re-set back to 1900 instead of 2000, which would have caused total chaos... Planes might fall out of the sky, your bank account might disappear, thousands of other scenarios, but it was not a doomsday prediction, and most of the people who say it was were probably too bloody young to remember it anyway....<br>  <br>  It is the Galactic Alignment which happens every 26,000 years, and the last time this happened Cro-Magnon man started producing beautiful cave paintings, jewelery, and his weapons became more sophisticated and the art of making stone tools also became a thing of beauty...

It is the end of the Mayan Long Count Calender, the beginning of a new era, not the end of the world..It has been called "The Shift" or "The Great Change" we will evolve spiritually... <br>  All the disasters which are happening throughout the world right now have been foretold, even in the Bible..<br>  Crop-circles are a direct communication from the Light Beings, Interdimensional travellers who are here to help with our Ascension into the 5th dimension..They are not man-made as the government and the government run puppet media would have you believe..They are also mentioned in the Bible, Acts 2:19..<br>  There is a new frequency being received right now by the earth and we are all being affected by it, many of us have a job to do and we are becoming aware of just who we really are..Many of us are Light Workers and we will have task of helping others understand what is happening...<br>  The Church knows this is happening and they are calling it the 2nd coming among other things, just another con really, they know their time is up...<br>  I will post a couple of sites for you, but I am more of a book man personally, and if you go to amazon.com and punch in 2012 there are plenty of books there...Also punch in Mayan prophesies, and you will be amazed as to how many people have written books on the subject...<br>  <a href="http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greatdreams.com/2012.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diagnosis2012.co.uk/1.htm</a><br>  There should be enough diverse information in just these two web-sites to get your mind thinking in overdrive...

AA10676836	The bible interprets itself.
31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	God is not forcing you in anyway to hell. That is your choice. His choice is for you to be with Him forever.<br>  If you do not believe Him, so be it. Only your religion says it but never God.<br>  There is just a written law  either by our society or by nature that says you have to live within the limits. You are free to do things you want provided you do not transgress any law "intentionally". There are punishments or payments built or written according to whatever crime or offenses you have committed and that is the same as how you get to heaven or hell. So, where then do you say that God will put you? <br>  You might even be surprised when time comes that you are seated before Him even if you did not believe in Him but because you have not transgressed any of His laws. You could be much luckier than those who believe but openly defies His laws? And aren't His laws just the same as the laws provided by our society? Try reading some of His Books. Do not mind about the Histories but take note of what He simply wants from His people. Aren't those the same as what the law of the land want having a peaceful community of man?<br>  Maybe it is you who will never understand God. <br>  Whatever reward or punishment is there on man, it is never given forcibly by God. Man earns what he deserves according to how and what choices he made in his life. <br>  The teacher of the school never fails a student, the student made the choice to earn his grade. God is just the same.|`|e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	you have no excuse for believing in God.<br>  <br>  you can't see the wind, just the effects of it, yet you believe it's there, you feel something on your skin someone says it's wind and you believe them, that it is the wind.<br>  <br>  Nature is evidence of God, yet atheist are so hard headed they would rather say it's evolution instead of God.<br>  <br>  There is proof, your just so pirdeful and stiffnecked that you refuse to see it.<br>  You blame God for your problems or people going to hell,<br>  God won't force someone to go to hell or heaven, that's why He sent His son so people could choose.|`|WwCBomTMaa	I think you answered your own question. *Because you don't believe in him!* God gives you a list of things you have to do to get into Heaven. He then gives you the choice of doing the things on the list or not. Just like a parent saying "You either put your toys away or you are getting a spanking." The child has a choice. One will lead to peace and the other will lead to punishment. It is your choice entirely......if you don't believe in "something that presents no evidence of existing" stop asking questions about Him.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe in God, how can you expect to get the rewards from him?|`|b94573ef3c2d94b3f4ddd867c8a6cc47aa	I KNOW RIGHT?!?!<br>  This all loving god loves us soooo much that he creates such baaad things..<br>  Like diseases... and bad people... and hell..<br>  <br>  Such a nice god..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There is no problem with not believing in gods.. you can still have your normal life..

He does not punish, you do that to yourself.|`|Nxolwd5Baa	each to their own belief, maybe what you believe determines what happens to you after you die, for christians; heaven, for muslims; paradise; for buddhists; nirvana, for atheists; nothing, for me; an eternity of new experiences as wonderful as this one....|`|E1qOtwZ3aa	God gives you a chance,many actually,but at the end of your life,if you decide to be really truly sorry and you show it with your faith,then you wont go burning in hell.Think about it,i dont see air,does that mean it isnt real????no it is real.for all you know God could be standing right behind or in front of you but the human eye doesnt see him.Just cause you cant see it doesnt mean it isnt real.|`|68lLAQnKaa	It is the choice of each individual where they would like to spend eternity, not God's.  One thing God can't do is violate the laws he has subjected himself to, one being 'free will,' it is not his decision whether someone spend eternity in hell or not it is that individuals.  He doesn't want anyone to go to hell...<br>  <br>  2 Peter 3:9 9 -'The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises, according to some people's conception of slowness, but He is long-suffering (extraordinarily patient) toward you, not desiring that any should perish, but that all should turn to repentance.'<br>  <br>  thats why he gives salvation freely to all who believe, repent and call upon him.  <br>  <br>  There are concequences for every decision that we make in life, if you choose to jump in a pool, you will get wet, and there is no way of avoiding that outcome, that is just what happens.  The consequence for believing in Jesus and repenting is salvation and eternal life.  And the consequence for not doing that is hell... <br>  <br>  I hear what your saying about being a good person and living with high morals, but it just isn't enough to get you into heaven.  <br>  <br>  An example:  You are a U.S citizen, you know it, and everyone you know knows that you are, but unless you have a passport you can't get into another country.  Our passport to heaven is Jesus Christ.  <br>  <br>  There is more evidence for his existance and diety than any other said 'religious figure' in the world.<br>  <br>  I'd be happy to tell you more, email me if you'd like some more information|`|AA10945101	Do you forgive people that don't ask for forgiveness?  More importantly, do you hand out priceless gifts to people who don't acknowledge your existence or worse, hate you?<br>  <br>  Where did you get the idea that God will "force someone into hell for all eternity for simply not believing in him"? Of all the possible perspectives on hell, and there are a lot of them, that's the one that's the least consistent with the way God defined and described it.  <br>  <br>  Yes, I would agree that logic, criticism and doubt are honorable attributes that should be rewarded...and I believe God made it perfectly clear that he will reward those attributes.  At the same time, humility and faith are also honorable attributes...do you think people should be rewarded for refusing to accept advice from their boss or for demanding proof of everything before they are willing to do what their boss asks them to do.  Would you call such a person an "honorable" employee?<br>  <br>  Consider this perspective, God created you and put you here for a reason...to learn something that you need to learn to be capable of sharing eternity with him.  If you don't even acknowledge his existence or that particular learning goal, do you have any chance of learning what he knows you need to know...and if you don't learn what you need to learn, should you expect to enjoy the benefits of that learning?<br>  <br>  Hell is irrelevant...it wasn't even created for us (according to the bible).  If you don't believe in God then there is no logical reason to believe in hell either...and if you do believe in God, then there is no logical reason for focusing your attention on anything except the rewards offered for doing what he designed you to do...and if you do this, then you have nothing to fear from hell!<br>  <br>  I love my son beyond all imagination...and I accept that I can't force him to learn something that he doesn't want to learn...I can teach him to obey rules but I can't force him to accept or understand the logic behind those rules nor can I protect him from the consequences if he chooses to ignore my advice.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Omg, God gives you chance after chance after chance after chance to turn from your ways and have faith in him, eventually you don't get anymore chances. You just expect to do what you want to do here on earth and then expect God to just let you in Heaven. <br>  <br>  God rewards those who had faith in him who relied on him when everyone else was saying that there is no God. He's not going to reward those who sat here on Earth and talked all there smack about God not being real. Now is the time to believe and change. When you die it is to late. No more chances after that plain and simple.<br>  <br>  And blind acceptance isn't the word for it.<br>  It's called faith. I don't just say I "believe" in God.<br>  Satan believes in him as well.<br>  I allow God to lead me life, period.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Why should He permit non-believers into the paradise He built for the believers. Non-believers live their life with the concept that they will not be punished for the way they have lived.<br>  <br>  EVERYONE is welcomed into the gates of Heaven, But you must first choose to accept and live for Jesus.<br>  <br>  If you deny Him, He will deny you. Its that simply<br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  You not accepting Him is the same as you denying Him. <br>  So that means you don't believe He was the Son of God, that He died for your sins, that He rose 3 days later, that you are a sinner and the only way to heaven is through Jesus? Are my assumptions correct?

Lk4aCBACaa	The quest to find the right place for his oracle. :)<br>  <br>  "Shortly after his birth on the island of Delos, the precocious god Apollo embarked on his first adventure. In a beautifully lyrical passage of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the handsome young divinity is depicted traveling the earth and then ascending to Olympus, where he charmed the gods and goddesses with his music. The goddesses - including the Muses, Charites (Graces), Horae (Seasons), Aphrodite, Hebe, and Artemis - were especially fond of Apollo, and they sang and danced to welcome his arrival. The god then retired from the company of his fellow Olympians to begin a quest to locate the appropriate site for an oracle.<br>  <br>  After searching far and wide, Apollo finally found a place that pleased him. He informed Telphousa, the resident nature spirit, of his intentions to build a temple at her sacred spring, but the nymph discouraged him from this plan. Telphousa instead suggested that Apollo select Delphi as the site for his shrine, and the god therefore left the spring and continued his journey. Near Delphi, Apollo encountered and killed the enormous serpent Python (the god's priestess was named Pythia to commemorate this event). According to some sources, this in part is the mythological explanation for how the oracle of Apollo was established at Delphi."|`|v20S8oSJaa	um...the story of achilles?<br>  <br>  XXX Naomi XXX

KBBonf97aa	It's normal and common for teenage girls to experience same-sex attractions that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  It has to do with elevated hormone levels, which have caused girls to question their sexuality since the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, but most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during adolescence, but usually temporary.  That's why there are so many teenagers who identify as bisexual, but very few who don't identify as straight or gay by the time they're in their 20s or older.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who considered themselves bisexual as teens grew up to be happily heterosexual.  And the hipness of bisexuality actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in fashion.  Very often they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that will probably confuse you more.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female, and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why most teens who think they're bisexual realize later that they were wrong.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a very wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have declared herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  If you've always liked guys and the attraction to girls started during adolescence, chances are you're completely straight and you're just going through normal hormonal turmoil.  The good thing about sexual orientation is that it always sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|yteRTQFAaa	do u think about gurls?. wen a gurl go pass u do u look?<br>  r u 'turned on' and have sexual feelings about both ur own and the other gender.

3XLAs6Isaa	Jews believe in the one, supreme, omnipotent, omniscient Ruler of the universe. Jews do not believe in a "son" of G-d. Jews do not believe in a "holy ghost". There are no secondary gods or goddesses. There is also no Satan in Judaism, as this would suggest a power that could challenge G-d's, which cannot exist.<br>  <br>  EDIT <br>  <br>  Note: "Messianic Judaism" is not Judaism. One of the major distinguishing factors between Judaism and christianity is the thought that Jesus is the Messiah. Jews reject Jesus.

In religion, people believed differently about the so called "gods and goddesses". <br>  For example, Atheist Means "absent god". Monotheistic means "one god", polytheism means "Many gods".

You can find the general rule here: <a href="http://www.gcse.com/french/adjectives_plural.htm," rel="nofollow">http://www.gcse.com/french/adjectives_pl...</a> BUT keep in mind that there are exceptions. You should check a French grammar book for those.<br>  <br>  In the example you give, you're speaking of two people, one female and the other male. The plural would be in the "masculin" form, that is: "amusants". If you write "amusantes", you'd be referring to two or more females. <br>  Note that the verb should be plural as well ("sont").

AA11440601	Some saints are recognized as patron saints of certain peoples, places, things, and occupations due to circumstances surrounding their lives. <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  People: Saint Peter was a fisherman before he became a fisher of men and is the patron saint of fishermen (and popes).<br>  <br>  Place: Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland and is the patron saint of Ireland.<br>  <br>  Things: Saint Claire was near death and was unable to attend Mass, she turned in the direction of the Chapel. The wall between her and Chapel vanished and she was able to both view the Mass and participate. For this reason, she is the patroness of TV. <br>  <br>  Occupation: Saint Matthew the Apostle was a tax collector and is the patron of accountants, bankers, bookkeepers, and, yes, tax collectors .<br>  <br>  For lists of patron saints by topic, see:<br>  <a href="http://saints.sqpn.com/patron00.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saints.sqpn.com/patron00.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.org/saints/patron.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/saints/patron.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/patrons.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.americancatholic.org/Features...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|HUePP83xaa	its based on their life works, like st gregory was a teacher and is the patron saint os students and teachers|`|VWvI5RyBaa	It's because of what they did in their life on earth.

At the moment God can mean too many things.|`|AA11297267	Yes, there is no evidence (empirical or other) to show there is any kind of a god.<br>  <br>  But when you talk about evidence that "god" doesn't exist, you have to be more specific, and define which "god" you're talking about...simply because there is a LOT of evidence that shows particular gods don't exist.<br>  <br>  Take the "christian god" for example:  <br>  In the christian god's holy book, the god's son is quoted as saying that if you have a tiny bit of faith the size of a mustard seed, you can command a mountain to move and it will move.  That's a testable prediction, isn't it?  The god's son has stated something as a fact, and we can test to see if he was lying or not.<br>  Has anyone, ever, anywhere, ever commanded a mountain to move and had it move?  No.  One has to assume that out of the billions of christians who have ever lived, at least a few of them would have had the tiny amount of faith the god's son says is required to move a mountain...but no mountain has ever moved.<br>  That testable prediction fails its test, and so there are only three possible conclusions one can draw:<br>  a) the god's son was lying<br>  b) the guy claiming to be god's son wasn't god's son<br>  c) the promise is false<br>  <br>  All three of those indicate that the christian god is either NOT a god at all, or is completely made up.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of such testable statements made in the christian god's holy book -- and not one of them ever passes a single test.  Taken together, they clearly show that there is no such thing as the christian god.<br>  <br>  So while I can't say there is no god of any kind anywhere...I can with great confidence say there is no such thing as the christian god, since the evidence clearly shows he doesn't exist.  <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|Yzcptoagaa	Of course, that's a ridiculous point because you can't prove the non-existence of an intangible and immeasurable thing with empiric evidence.  But there are very good reasons to believe that the world was not designed by an intelligent being who cares for us.  Like:<br>  <br>  Your appendix<br>  <br>  Hemorrhoids<br>  <br>  99.9999999....% of the universe is uninhabitable by humans.<br>  <br>  Want some more?|`|AA12193600	There is no emerical evidence that SOME deity does not exist for that is in the realm of philosophy.  However, there is emperical evidence that if such deity exists it is NOT the abrahamic god.  The bible taken as the basis of the belief in a abrahamic deity is full of inconsistancies and many stories in it are totally at odds with observeable verifiable fact. (there is no emperical evidence as you say for the great flood for example, the ten plagues of egypt for example).  Further it is relatively obivious that much of the old testament is based on ancient sumerian and egyptian mythology.  For example--the epic of gilgamesh predates the Noah story by about a thousand years--the sumerian king sargon myth--again about a thousand years older than the bible story is the basis for the moses myth.  Add to that finally the fact that there is very little in the way of historical verification of any of the bible--in fact it describes events which did not happen--further drives the nail into Joe Hovahs coffin.  So I'lkl grant you that there is no emperical evidence that a deity does not exist--however there are carloads of emperical, verifiable evidneces that it is NOT the xtian god.|`|JUviY9hoaa	If there is no evidence of either, then why bother asking a question like this? <br>  <br>  You have no evidence to support your beliefs and from what you say we have no evidence to not believe, but we aren't asking you why do you believe.<br>  <br>  Sure we think it's silly, but we don't question why.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	The fact that there IS no evidence for your god is reason enough not to take the God Hypothesis seriously.<br>  <br>  Now go Google "burden of proof" -- then delete this question, before you embarrass yourself further.|`|NrzxtivLaa	first, the burden of proof lies with those making the positive assertion, second, the idea of an omniscient, omnipotent entity defies all logic the universe has been proven to operate by...|`|to8CkYp2aa	What would empirical evidence of non-existence look like?|`|a5Z1xfejaa	is there empirical evidence that fairies don't exist?|`|BABcrdMKaa	Burden of proof...|`|AA11289144	There is no empirical evidence that a mythical creature called "MMMM" that wanders the universe and spanks God everyday doesn't exist either.  <br>  <br>  By your argument, I can spawn a million "God-like" creatures and say you can't prove that they don't exist.|`|4PwPsjJpaa	I base my decision on the fact that the bible was written by the hand of man, a superstitious tribe of men from one very small part of the world. This god never spoke to anyone else in any other part of the world, not the asians, not the africans, not the native americans, not the eskimos, just this one very small tribe of men. in addition to this the bible has been translated over and over and over again, not to mention that much of what is written in the bible needs to be interperted based on your opinion because it's so vague and cryptic. this is why i do not follow the teachings of the bible or believe in said god.|`|14JVQP9Paa	The Bible is what we know about God.

(if that is the god to which you are referring) So it stands to reason that he has no issue with proving to people that he is real. Therefore, simple ask him to appear before you to prove he is, then what ever happens is your answer. If you try to get out of this by saying you should not temp the lord your god. Jesus said ask it in my name and it will be given. So ask in Jesus name. You could kill to birds with one stone.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

They could be jailed...or beat up.   <br>  <br>  I grew up in Ohio, so I never dealt with that sort of out and out segregation with the signs, but there were plenty of "unwritten rules" about where Black people could or couldn't go.  Anyway, a few years back, I dated a guy who grew up in Texas during the 50s and 60s where they had the Jim Crow segregation in effect.  On one date, we were out antiquing and we saw one of those signs on sale in one of the shops.  We just looked at the sign then at each other but didn't say anything for about an hour or so, then he told me of his childhood. Sounded just awful.  It was a real eerie feeling seeing that sign and realizing that it really did happen at one point in our nation's history.|`|9g8spRvPaa	I remember when I was really young,like 3 or so back in the late 50's in Conn.<br>  I was out with my family and I started to drink out of a public water fountain when my mother ran up and stopped me.<br>  She told me to drink from another one because the one I was going to use was for "Colored' as it was called back then.<br>  I didn't understand what the problem was but did what my parents said to do.<br>  It is too bad that some people had to put signs  on things, it would be nice if we were all innosent children that didn't see colors or read stupid signs.<br>  ( I should note that I am white but my mother was from the Mohawk Indian nation through her mother and faced racism herself as a child.)|`|vYAgIMLdaa	I was around long before the "race riots (Detroit and elsewhere) and remember what you are referring to.

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Although most people would accept a man hitting a woman if it was a case of dire self-defense, we have a double standard. Our society seems to accept a woman hitting a man but not the other way around. For example, how many movies can you think of where a woman slaps a man across the face? How many times do you see a woman getting mad at a man and kicking them or throwing something at them? Seldom do you ever see this portrayed as being unacceptable and you usually don't see the man defending themselves. They are shown just standing there and taking it. How many movies can you name where it is portrayed that a man slapping a woman across the face, kicking her, or throwing something at her with her standing there taking it? The man is always portrayed very negatively.<br>  <br>  This is the double standard that I see.<br>  <br>  I think that all physical violence is wrong if it is not in self-defense. However, society seems to disagree with that sometimes.<br>  <br>  To answer your last question, No, women and men are not equal in our society.  In the US, a man must register with Selective Services when he turns 18 in case of a draft.  Women do not register.  Some people say that is because the women should be home with their children but this doesn't make much sense to me because only a tiny fraction of 18 year old women have children.  What are they staying home with---their eggs?|`|joA5Rcyzaa	i agree with you here<br>  <br>  i know plenty of women that can fight and i feel sorry for the man that takes their hits<br>  <br>  it really is dumb i completely agree, men shouldn't hit women and women shouldn't hit men|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Yeah, sad that people don't realize it's not right for anyone.<br>  <br>   I remember in the funny papers when I was a kid<br>  <br>  In "Blondie", Dagwood's boss was always getting beat up by his wife.<br>  <br>  In "Barney Google and Snuffy Smith", Lukey was always getting hit over the head with a frying pan by his wife Elviney, it only took me 10 seconds to find an example<br>  <br>  <a href="http://est.rbma.com/content/Barney_Google?date=20090101" rel="nofollow">http://est.rbma.com/content/Barney_Googl...</a><br>  <br>  Such things were considered 'humorous"|`|nD9TttoJaa	Right and wrong, as the world goes, are only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.

Don't buy unless you realistically perceive that the house will incease in value, or you put great stock in being able to personalize everything. <br>  <br>  You should carefully analyse your cost of living.

Where the heck did you come up with that logic or should I say lack off?<br>  Honestly you need to get out more. <br>  As a Muslim should I ever be "proved" wrong in my beliefs the last think I would be doing would be ending my life, nor would I be depressed and panic about what exactly? <br>  I think your statement is way, way, way of base.

And there are various men out there who act like complete losers, and don’t give a damn about a woman’s heart. Where can you find a man who has just love to offer? They either try too hard, or don’t make an effort at all. <br>  <br>  Sighs.|`|9085d5e62eea0b47f788548bcb282266aa	I'm a man and definitely not a dog. I'm very angry that someone would even ask such a rude question. Why don't you ask if you yourself are a dog or not?|`|zVCNdIWkaa	No they're not. It's not fair to generalize. Just because some men act like dogs, doesn't make all men dogs.|`|uf2D35btaa	ROFL ROFL|`|SaYZBTfqaa	ahahhahahahahahahahahahhahhahahhahaha|`|berHpm4eaa	there are bad males and good males js like females.. :)<br>  but their not dogs..their humans just like us :)|`|4oQyDdvdaa	idk...i'm a 16yr old muslim..|`|4aveC2aaaa	Some. I agree, some men are dogs, and very filthy. <br>  <br>  They deceive a woman into thinking they really love her, when all they want is satisfaction and their own lusty pleasure. <br>  <br>  Men can be honest, and other men can be not honest. I think it all depends on how they were raised and how honest they are to themselves. <br>  <br>  Tell me, when was the last time you saw a true gentleman lower his gaze upon seeing a female? Not muslim, any gentleman?! Yes, very rarely will you find an honest man. <br>  <br>  The key is to not look for them, rather, let him come to you. <br>  <br>  I have met dirty men in my lifetime, and I have told them off. I am not afraid of letting my honest opinion out there because I stand firm with my beliefs. I have told them that they are nothing near becoming gentlemen and they are nothing honest, and a dog has better manners than they. <br>  <br>  I agree with you once more, men can be dogs. The key with dealing with dogs is, they bark a lot, and when they bark, it is your job to either throw a bone and have them shut up, or simply ignore them and have them shut up on their own. <br>  <br>  The thing with throwing a bone to the dogs is, they will silent themselves for a while, then begin barking again for another bone, and they will soon come to take advantage of you. <br>  <br>  Hence, my solution is to simply ignore the barkings. What will it ever do to me but make me dissatisfied? <br>  <br>  Good question brother ^_^<br>  <br>  But let me make it clear, that I said SOME men, not all. It is not fair to that handful of true gentlemen out there.|`|7Q33v5hOaa	It is true that men have a stereotype of behaving like dogs because throughout history they have been labelled as the 'superior sex' and treating women badly but not all men behave like this, those who try and follow the prophet (saas) are the best of men Alhumdulillah; modest, humble, respectful and honest. So no I dont believe all men are dogs.
ZtzKsVjdaa	It's not just rappers that are hypocritical.  I hear a lot of liberals at my school use those words.

qMcTeBavaa	Although I seldom go, I love libraries. Everyone in my family gives me gift cards to Half Price Books for my birthday and Christmas, I can spend hours there. <br>  <br>  The beauty of a library is that I can find what I want, or they'll tell me which branch has it, I can take it home, bring it back in a week and get another. If I find something I really like, I know what I'm searching for when I go to Half Price Books.<br>  <br>  To be honest, since I never sell books, I could arguably be considered a library. Among the other's that I, since I'm not a library science major, curate is my great grandfather's autobiography. It floors me every time I pull it out and realize that I'm holding more than a century of history in my hands. <br>  <br>  Should my house ever catch fire, you can flip a coin. Either my dog or that autobiography is going through the window first, before the other and before I get out.<br>  <br>  I think it was Twain who said that "Outside of a book, dog is man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it is too dark to read."<br>  <br>  D|`|Ao52XHjCaa	I spent so much time in libraries that I honestly can't stay in them that long any more. I am using mine again because I'm trying to cut expenses, but I can't do research there. I would rather go to the book store where I can have coffee. But I agree about the maps...I always need to have a map available. I will pick some random obscure country off the map and find out as much as I can about it and imagine going there on vacation. Someday, I will learn to ride a horse in Mongolia or watch a good sepak takraw match in Malaysia. I just don't do that research in libraries any longer.|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	Oui! I love libraries! They are absolutely amazing. I do tend to get kicked out though. Actually, the last time I was there I tried to front flip over a book cart.

Ayn7TqLRaa	One very religious lady I knew lived to be in her 90s ~ she spent all her life as a very prim and proper catholic, never drank, never smoked, considered the word "poo" to be outright swearing. She got dementia in her 80's and when my friend visited her in the nursing home when she was about 89 ~ she was met with a tirade of "go f**k yourself, you ugly f**king c**t". When she mentioned this to the Nursing home staff, they told her that all she did was swear, blaspheme, steal other peoples cigarettes and be totally abusive to the other residents.<br>  <br>  Now that's 80 years of a repressed mind coming to the surface.<br>  <br>  Personally I agree with what someone has written - I'd rather die at 60 or 70 than sit in a nursing home in my wee and poo and not know who I am or what I am<br>  <br>  now let me roll another ciggie and not believe in god!|`|M4WIWMgBaa	We have the stress of reality weighing down on us.|`|WcxrnINvaa	Religious people have the happy feeling that there's an uber parent that looks after them, so probably feel less stressed.<br>  Atheists have to face reality by themselves which is slightly more stressful in the long run with no invisible parent to run to for forgiveness.|`|AA11987172	Probably because they don't drink, smoke, fornicate, or engage in any other fun activities.<br>  <br>  Srsly, you can knock off the last 10-20 years of my life, those years suck anyways.

Stress kills, you know.|`|AA11883252	no|`|QuaVnaOEaa	They live longer, (if you really believe the study, ) is because God wants to see and be with doubters first rather than his followers first. And, if heaven is such a wonderful place, why would anyone want to live in the horrible world  away from God for a long time? We all die and time is relative so ..... what's the point ?  Is it an "I'm better than you !"  or something akin to that ?|`|I1tfz8nVaa	Bit of a stretch to be honest.
7gH7sgi6aa	According to the Big Book of Etiquette ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!  Regifting is to be done when the gift is given to someone who has no prior knowledge of where or when the gift came from.  Regifiting a gift someone knows about is tacky, and then asking for the receipt is double tacky.  Gifts are not for exchange purposes...they are GIFTS...they are given from the heart and are to be excepted the exact same way.....never questioned or nothing else ever expected.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|jsxphZJEaa	You should be grateful for any gift. That said, a gift given not age appropriate or size is lack of respect, thought and manners and is unacceptable and YES I would ask for receipt.

I get the point though.  So aside from murder slavery is one of the worst things that can be done? How about rape or being a pedophile? Those seem to rank up there pretty high as well.<br>  <br>  The bible was written in a time when slavery was done everywhere, and God rewarded his faithful servants with servants of their own.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	Huh. Did you know you don't know what you're talking about? Here is why slavery is included in the law. God doesn't think very highly of slave traders.<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 1:8-11  We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.  (9)  We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,  (10)  for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine  (11)  that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.

I really hope this is just a flippant question and nobody could really imagine you can 'sign on' and play as you intend to. Believe me you will be begging the college to take you back. At present there is no reprieve whatever for young, healthy people who won't work. Courses, upon course you will require to go on, jobs upon jobs you will require to show you are applying for.

The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

Satan will have no capacity to be "happy" because God will punish him as well. God rules ALL.<br>  <br>  Plus, Satan is an evil deceiver. Even if you "follow" him, he wouldn't reward you... he's too evil. Satan is described in the Bible as the "father of lies." He leads people astray, and they receive nothing but pain and suffering in return.<br>  ______________<br>  <br>  First of all, according to the Bible, Satan was forced to leave Heaven, not Hell. Second, Satan will not punish people in Hell. God will set the punishment. Satan will himself be punished in Hell, along with everyone else who ends up there. There are many misconceptions about these things that are often portrayed on TV and in magazines, etc. Another fallacy is that Satan is ruling Hell. The Bible does not teach this. It does teach that there are demons that are following Satan right now, on Earth, but once they are in Hell, they will not have a kingdom of any kind. They will be suffering.
AA10702349	Even though the NWT version apparently reflects pretty accurately what the author of Psalm 146:3-4 describes about the state of those who are dead, consciousness doesn't stop at death, Nina. Why do I say this is so? Because the New Testament witness is contrary to what the Psalmist has said and is replete with passages saying otherwise. People here who are quoting the OT verses such as this one, and those in Ecclesiates, aren't aware that the OT writers weren't as educated about the afterlife as those during the intertestamental period and the NT. Little is said in the OT about a resurrection from the dead. We must remember that the Bible is a compilation of books that reveals God's intent for us in a progressive manner concerning our redemption. This is sadly not taken into account much of the time when we read these books. They are not to be read as if they were specifically written just for us, in our time, as if they were today's newspaper. Remember, they were written within a cultural and historical context, and before the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and that we are benefactors of the universal truths revealed by God in them and through them, but within the scope and limits of that time period and culture. This is how one should read these verses out of the Psalms, as well as the entire book of Ecclesiastes: what it would be like if there was no resurrection from the dead, in contrast to what the NT says, especially chapters like 1 Corinthians 15.<br>   <br>  Having said this, let's now look at the "post-resurrection" Biblical literature, what the NT says, about consciousness after physical death. What comes to my mind right away is Jesus' confrontation with the leaders of that day, and in particular the Sadducees, who didn't believe in a resurrection from the dead. He said to them that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob was not the God of the dead, but of the living. (Matthew 22:32) This clearly means that all three Hebrew patriarchs were in an afterlife state of being alive and very conscious! And did not Jesus say, just before admitting to being the great I AM, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad" in John 8:56? Then there's the rich man and Lazarus story in Luke 16:19-31. It is clear that this is not a parable, since the characters have names (i.e., the bosom of Father Abraham was taught by intertestamental writers as being a heavenly place close to God) and are real people from Biblical accounts. To say this story is only symbolic as parables are, and as Russellites do, just doesn't hold water because of this primary difference with all the parables that Jesus taught. And since its characters are real, so was the account. The rich man was in conscious torment in Hades, while Lazarus was by Abraham's side. The Greek word "hades" and the Hebrew "sheol" are properly translated as the "netherworld" or "underworld", and NOT the "grave", as you might find incorrectly at times in the KJV. There are other words in both languages to describe what a grave or burial ground was, such as "taphos" (Acts 2:29) and "mnaimeion" (Mark 15:46) in the Koine Greek. No, during the time before Christ's resurrection, there was a place called "Paradise" (Luke 23:43), a sort of transitory but heavenly state, where Father Abraham was, in Hades or Sheol. There was also there a place of torment, where all souls like the rich man went, which is the state of death about which the prophet Ezekiel forewarned (Ezekiel 18:4). (Contrary to what Chuck has said here, he was NOT warning us about the grave. That interpretation doesn't really even make any sense, since all will go there, whether they sin or not.) Everyone was in either place in Hades after physical death, clearly in a conscious state. Even Jesus was there after He died. (Ephesians 4:8-9; 1 Peter 3:19) And, after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, those who were in the Paradise section of Hades went to Heaven before the throne of God, and all who die in Christ since then go immediately after they die. There is no longer this transitory place called Paradise in Hades, at the bosom of Father Abraham. As said before, Abraham even longed to see Jesus' day (John 8:56), and indeed saw it while in Paradise, but is now in Heaven in God's presence, due to Jesus' redemptive work at the cross. Hades only remains now a place of torment, otherwise known in the Greek as "Gehenna", in the Hebrew as "Hinnoam", or Hell, and all in Hades are conscious, according to a multitude of texts in the NT (e.g., Luke 16:23-24; Matthew 25:46). <br>  <br>  As for us, does not Jesus tell us in John 5:24 that we have ALREADY past out of death into life, in this life? So, how can anyone who has been granted eternal life now by God, be in an unconscious state after death, when they die? That's not life; now is it? All the verses in the NT (i.e., 1 Thessalonians 4) that speak about us "falling asleep" before our resurrection from the dead refer to the body; not one's soul or spirit, which remains conscious. You will never find a passage in the Bible when speaking of a resurrection, it being about the soul or spirit. It ALWAYS refers to the physical body. It is our soul or spirit that immediately go before the presence of God, in the bliss of Heaven (2 Corinthians 5:10; Philippians 1:20-22), or completely separated from Him, in the torment of Hell in Hades, before this resurrection to come. We all experience a temporary separation of our body from our soul or spirit due to the Adamic curse of death's remaining affects until Jesus' return, when this unnatural separation will end.|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	Pretty accurate according to Strong's Dictionary and compared to the KJV;<br>  <br>  Psa 146:3-4  Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.

(12)  Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  (13)  Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

The entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, conveys the idea that a soul is a life and that it dies, and that our hope for eternal life after we die rests with a resurrection which will occur at some point in the future which no person, not even Jesus, knows. Only God knows. <br>  <br>  If you believe that souls do not die, then you have fallen for the same lie that Eve fell for; Gen 3:4  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br>  <br>  This was the first lie ever told and evidently is a very powerful one, especially since there is nothing appealing at all about the thought of dying. Getting to the bottom of this debate, as with many Biblical debates, requires breaking down the meanings of the Greek and Hebrew words used. In this case, the words for "soul" mean "breath" or "life", so a soul IS a life. No soul = no breath or no life, i.e. nothing is alive. <br>  <br>  If the verses I quoted aren't convincing enough, then you create a sturdy argument for atheism!|`|EJHhCDcaaa	They use this verse to implant the ideal that when the body dies so does the soul and spirit of man does not exist.  When they (JW's) are resurrected, it's from the memory of God.  I guess if you die and everything dies with you, the body, the soul and the spirit doesn't exist, my question is, what is there to resurrect, it's all dead.  <br>  I feel this way: The human body was formed by God "of dust from the ground." God gave spirit to the human being when He "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life". When God formed the body of the human from dust and imparted life to him by "breathing (a spirit) into his nostrils", "man became a living soul". The body is God-formed. The spirit is God-given. With these gifts, man becomes a unique living soul.  That the body is formed of the elements of the earth (dust) is confirmed by Old Testament passages. "By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, because from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." (Gen 3:19). "All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust." (Eccl 3:20). The Apostle Paul tells us that our fleshly bodies belong to a "humble state" (or "lowly" or "vile" state). (Phil 3:21). This suggests that the body is composed of different more "humble" elements (such as the dust of the ground) than other parts such as spirit and soul.<br>  <br>  That man's spirit was given to him by God is also indicated in Old and New Testament passages. "Thus declares the Lord who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him." (Zech 12:1). "The spirit will return to God who gave it." (Eccl 12:7). "He jealously desires the spirit which He has made to dwell in us." (James 4:5). <br>  <br>  The original meaning of the word spirit in both Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek was "breath" or "wind", a figure of speech illustrating the fact that it is that which was bequeathed to, "breathed into", man by God. (Gen 2:7).<br>  <br>  Human beings, therefore, have both body and spirit. But the human characteristic is more than just body and spirit, but is called soul. Human beings are living souls. Hence the Bible often calls man soul. For example, when Jacob went down into Egypt with his family, the Bible tells us that "all the persons (souls) of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy." (Gen 46:27). All those who had received the gospel message from Peter on the day of Pentecost were baptized and "there were added that day about three thousand souls." (Acts 2:41). <br>  <br>  Apparently the word soul stands for the unique human personality, that which makes him mankind. Thus, "the first man, Adam, became a living soul." (1 Cor 15:45). <br>  <br>  The word for soul in the Old and New Testaments is not always translated soul but is sometimes translated person, life, heart, or mind. "In the days of Noah, during the construction of the Ark,....eight persons (souls) were brought safely through the water." (1 Peter 3:20). "Do not be anxious for your life (soul), as to what you shall eat." (Matt 6:25). "Be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh....as to Christ....doing the will of God from the heart (soul)." (Eph 6:56). "The Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds (souls) of the Gentiles." (Acts 14:2). In each of these cases man's unique personality is signified by the Greek word for soul.<br>  <br>  The complete human being is God's creation. The unique body of each human was made by God. The unique spirit of each human came from God. Then, as the spirit quickened the body, God made in the human certain characteristics which were tantamount to a third part, a unique living soul. The human was then fully created as a unique living person, a triune being, with a consciousness of himself.<br>  <br>  How does God intend his created, triune human being to function within and in relation to the rest of His creation? Through human reasoning and observation of ourselves we human beings know something of the functioning of our bodies and their sensing abilities in the material world. And by noting that we have a consciousness of ourselves, that we are subject to various kinds of emotions, that we are able to assimilate and utilize knowledge, and that we have will power and the desire to exercise that will power in our lives, we know that there must be another part, a soul, within us quite different from our fleshly bodies. <br>  <br>  Thus, a person is aware that he has a body and a soul. We also know that God has given us life and that that life stops when we die. We deduce that an unseen or spiritual part of us has left the body to cause its death. So to a limited extent a person is aware of the functions of his body, soul, and spirit. But, a person is naturally aware only that he is made of flesh and unseen spirit which differ. Only by Biblical revelation from God does a person become aware of the three entities, spirit and soul and body,and how they are intended by God|`|NWa45ZDIaa	They're the same thoughts I have on the King James Version application on Psalms 146:3,4 <br>  "Put not your trust in princes, [nor] in the son of man, in whom [there is] no help.

Look around us at the economic situation and all of those who are looking to the government to help get us out of this mess when it was the government that got us into the mess to begin with.<br>  <br>  However, this is NOT saying that we do not exist after death. It tells us that whatever plans we may  have made will  stop when we die.   If we remember basic English and follow the subject of verse 4, we will go back to the nobles and those many place their trust in and we will see that their plans will vanish when they die.  More important, go on to the  next verse because this is what these two verse are leading up to...the point to be made is:<br>  <br>  Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:<br>  <br>  For those who think it proves that we cease to exist when we die, please know that Scripture can not contradict itself and there are too many places where we do see the dead in the presence of the Lord...or apart from the Lord such as the rich man in Luke 16 where we are told that in hell he lifted up his eyes and was in torments.  The fact that he could carry on a conversation shows he was alert.  <br>  <br>  Compare this with what Paul stated in Philippians 1:21 that for him to die would be gain.  For someone who had a heart for those who did not know Jesus (remember, Paul preached...Jesus, not Jehovah)  and often cried for them, how would spending even a day in a grave be a gain?   The only way Paul would consider it a gain is that he knew he would be in the presence of the LORD instantly as vs 23 shows:<br>  <br>  For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:<br>  <br>  This is also confirmed in 2 Corinthians 5:8  We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br>  <br>  Please remember that this promise is given only to those who  have placed their trust in Jesus for salvation...not to those who trust any religion, church or organization.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	sounds like the only version of the bible that's got it right.

khbSXMcIaa	i agree. someones race doesn't concern me.<br>  <br>  i think that people are brought up wrong. i heard one girl (who was quite young) say that she didn't like people with dark skin. when i asked her why, she said she didn't know. her parents put it in her head that people who are different then her are bad, and you shouldn't like them.<br>  <br>  i think that it's pretty sad our country is still like this.|`|015ae9b63882e617a5fe7b1d734490e1aa	Great points!  I honestly think that race would hardly be an issue if certain minority groups would stop asking for benefits because of their race.<br>  <br>  Another thing that doesn't help is when a black person calls another black person "n*gger/n*gga".  It's written in so many rap (trash) songs that it's no surprise that it's still in so many people's vocabularies.|`|4KIRr9SNaa	"Its been scientifically proven that no race is better or worse than another"<br>  <br>  My response:<br>  <br>  'The 1996 Task Force investigation on Intelligence sponsored by the American Psychological Association concluded that there are significant variations in I.Q. across races.'<br>  <br>  They are different and better and worse in different ways.

wyAtVqbOaa	I hate those people.  I ended up buying a timer and then putting the timer out of reach of their sticky fingers.  <br>  <br>  I told my friends that they want to see fish, first option is they come after the light comes on or second option, they get their own.<br>  <br>  If they can not respect my fish and my house then they are not welcome until they change their attitude and if they do put the light on, they will be asked to leave and they will not be welcome back.  <br>  <br>  I stuck to it and they respected me and my fish.  Now I have to sort out them touching the tank!<br>  <br>  If she does switch on the tank light when you re-enter the room, turn it off and keep doing this.  She'll get the message.|`|FcZU29W6aa	Tell her that the fish are important to you and if she turns the light on again she will no longer be welcome in your home.<br>  <br>  If you have a pet (yes, even fish) it is your responsibility to take care of them.  If you can't do this, give your fish to someone who will take care of them.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	You'll make a wonderful mother one day....|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Unplug it. Seriously. <br>  This assumes that you cannot say strongly enough to your friend "I will slap you silly the next time you do that!".<br>  <br>  So unplug the lamp and hide the end somewhere.<br>  When your friend comes along and fiddles with it, claim that the bulb needs to be replaced.<br>  <br>  Another thought:<br>  Buy one of those timers that plugs into the wall (and your tank light plugs in to it) that will turn the light on and off at the right times.<br>  Then a dab of glue on the light switch to disable it (in the On position). <br>  <br>  Now only the timer turns on your light and not your friend.|`|K6fasl6kaa	for goodness sake, that is your house, your fish and your choice as to when you have the light on.  it is hard to imagine anyone showing less respect than she is when she countermands this.  don't play baby games and unplug things.  throw her butt out of the house if she can't do things your way on this.  this is the same as anyone coming into your home and mistreating any of your pets.  way wrong.  tell her to get her own fish if she can't control her behavior with yours. be sure your wishes are clear.  don't hint for sake of politeness.  you can tell her nicely that she is welcome to see the fish between 1700 and 2300 when the light is on but not to touch the tank.  that's completely reasonable.|`|6710b87650d29aedb9ee3b4272d6af96aa	You can get things that lock on the plug so you cant switch them on or off, would that help.<br>  <a href="http://www.pluglock.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pluglock.co.uk/</a><br>  Or there is one on here that you put the plug in, you may be able to make one if your clever.<br>  <a href="http://www.familysafemedia.com/powerstop_power_plug_lock.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysafemedia.com/powerstop...</a><br>  Ours is fitted in the lid of the tank but has its own power supply separate from the filters etc. The locks go on the plug socket on the wall.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	Put some tape over the switch while it's in the off position..I had to do this with my grown up son who turned all 3 switches to the off position when 1 should remain on all the time..It worked.............|`|DGCIrUBcaa	Too much light can cause a lot of problems in a tank including excess alge which will disrupt the eco-system and eventually cause the fish to die.<br>  <br>  I would make up a sign that outlines the damaging effects of too much light in a tank. At the bottom write " If you keep leaving the light on you won't be able to see any fish because they will all be DEAD!!"  Then tape it to the tank for her to see.|`|xHlcnkgWaa	That's out of order.  Have a go at her and go into her room in the middle of the night switch the light on and say "sorry i couldn't see you properly" until she gets the message.<br>  <br>  Just say "Don't turn my tank light on, i don't want it on and if you keep doing it i'm going to have to ask you to leave if you wont respect my belongings"|`|AA10381258	The next time she brings it up, tell her this: "My fish are on a schedule, just like any other creature. You wouldn't wake a baby just to see it better, because it would be upset. So are my fish when they get off schedule. Please leave them sleep."|`|2WnnmCYHaa	Explain the situation to her as you have explained it to us.

CN3Ux1w2aa	Ooh I can be like that at times. Sometimes I simply don't want to listen so I shut my ears off, I do that a lot with my Maths teacher or my little sister. <br>  <br>  But at times it's because I'm daydreaming or thinking about something else. I don't mean to not listen but sometimes I just can't help it.<br>  <br>  I also am slightly slow so it takes me a while to understand what someone has just said. So it helps when someone explains in simpler manner [explains what they just said in a short but detailed way].<br>  <br>  My sister told me that I start to listen to conversations when they start to interest me. So say for example the topic becomes something I enjoy doing or when I'm being insulted. (I don't think you should insult them though =P ).|`|VMY7No0eaa	FIRST OF ALL ...

Their perception of language could be a problem.  This would have to be diagnosed by a language therapist.  The only way to deal with this is to simplify the way in which you speak and if need be repeating what you have said without sounding as if you are speaking to a three year old who has no knowledge of the English language, as that would be belittling.  Difficult but possible.|`|YYkZWJJ7aa	how old is the person? an older person is much more likely to have hearing issues, although it is not impossible for a younger person <br>  <br>  have you tried to ask him whether there is an issue? <br>  <br>  does he seem the type of person that would just choose to ignore you? i know i would never dare ignore someone by my partner probably would!|`|T2C6hqaAaa	I get this a lot too from some of my friends. I don't think they mean to be rude, they just either feel no need to reply (ie. if the statement wasn't that relevant or was obvious anyway) or they really didn't hear. Plus people are too wrapped up in their own thoughts and lives to hear about other people's. <br>  <br>  However, your case may be a different one. If they're questions you're saying, diected at him, try repeating them.|`|AA10381258	I would be sneaky. Right after saying something important, I'd ask, "What do you think?" It works on my fiance. They suddenly realize that not only were you speaking to them, but have caught on that they aren't paying attention. It will keep them on their toes throughout the conversation if they know you are seeking their opinion.|`|SH00UoHAaa	Sounds like ADD to me! Attention Deficit Disorder.

The concept of "race" as we use it amongst ourselves only came about fairly recently, and it was based on some dubious science.|`|B2HUARPCaa	Well, researchers have found that there is more genetic variation between two tribes in Africa than any other two groups of humans. We are all verrrrry similar genetically, and "race" isn't a scientific word to categorize people, it just has cultural significance.|`|VgPQM5W2aa	No, no, we are one species.  By definition, a race is a subgroup of a species.  Beings of the same species but different races can reproduce, whereas being of two different species' can not reproduce.|`|hLSIRDtZaa	I'm learning how to fly for the sake of my offspring through evolution.

Do you notice that in most surveys, even yahoo surveys, they still ask for race?|`|3zxVzPBxaa	what he said, one human species... there are many different races based on location and cultures. <br>  yeah, there are more differences between individuals than races... but its still important to recognize those differences.|`|Lz2q1q87aa	kinda like dogs they are all called dogs but different ones have different names like african and white|`|umEgRb7Vaa	If they can interbred then they belong to the same species.|`|npTZTzWRaa	no,one species
EXurNsB4aa	IF you are serious... and if it's a joke then I don't actually find it funny at all (and I always can laugh at, like, everything):<br>  <br>  Yes, you should delete him and I think you know that.  Lots of girls, myself included, make the mistake of thinking they can create some type of barrier where the persistent guy will just accept the boundaries you set and keep it that way.  It is not true, ever.  If it was then you wouldn't need the boundaries in the first place.<br>  <br>  Call of Duty is fun (seriouslyyy) but it is SO not worth having this crisis over!  PLEASE do the mature thing and stop your contact with him.  Really!  You are not stupid for not seeing it sooner.  He was probably charming and manipulative and flattering at first before it crossed the border of creepy.<br>  <br>  Once again, it is NOT WORTH IT to stay playing games with a group if you have to take that disturbing sh!t from some loser.  Please think about this and realize that it isn't worth it.|`|GGGmoyNeaa	You are probably better off deleting him if you are uncomfortable with his behavior,Shouldn't be too hard to find another group to play COD with and the others will have to look after themselves. But I'm sure if he tries his antics with them that they'll delete him also.|`|UR4mWefGaa	Naughty troll go to your room.|`|8qctM0B4aa	tell him your an amputee, then he wont wanna see you naked and sh*t like that|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Sorry for the one-liner, but you should call the police.

Not talk to him<br>  2. Get off the playstation<br>  3. Suck it up and stop playing along. You can still have a meaningful game of CoD with a pedophile, you just have to stop responding to his sexual remarks. <br>  <br>  Look, I play CoD and quite frankly this isn't a life or death situation.<br>  Just ignore him and kill some terrorists.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think calling the police is ridiculous. I could understand doing something like that if he asked you for nude pics, personal info, solicited sex, or made threats, but if he's just acting like a jack@ss ignore him. Don't communicate with him outside the game, and when you're in the game just keep the conversation to CoD related material.|`|7cBOKehWaa	OMG DELETE HIM is correct. If you carry on, soon he'll want your phone number... Then to meet you... Then your address...<br>  <br>  Seriously... If he'd a paedo, phone the police... That's the only way to get him to stop. But just before you do that send him a PS3 message saying "Don't drop the soap" >:3|`|DArAz67Caa	REPORT HIM TO THE AUTHORITIES-----what a disgusting----vile human being---!!<br>  those whom abuse children need to seek out Jesus---!!|`|GVcO1dtnaa	Definitely delete him.

You are a girl in a sea of virgins when you play online games, what the **** do you expect? You are an immediate target for jokes, ridicule, sexual abuse, ect in the same way any man would be if he walked into a female dominated area.<br>  <br>  If you are offended by anythign someone says, you can just block them. Its simple as that, but the fact that you think you can take legal action is FUNNY AS ****<br>  <br>  <br>  Hell, you dont even have proof that hes a pedophile! Your making assumptions over nothing! "In the stages of getting a victim?" ARE YOU ******* THICK? ONLINE GAMING IS NOT A OUTLET FOR FINDING PEOPLE TO HAVE SEX WITH. Ever heard of Myspace? facebook? THOSE are where pedo's find victims, not on call of duty!<br>  <br>  I can't believe how irrational you are being, grow up - this is exactly why guys dont like girls playing games with them, you cant handle it and this questions prove that point<br>  <br>  lmfao
ni6SCUm9aa	Sorry, but there is only one option - delete him.<br>  <br>  Whether you like it or not, I see no other way out...|`|DArAz67Caa	tell him that if he does not leave you and who else alone----you shall report him to the proper authorities-----what else do you want from me---??|`|ColDKgGuaa	Who cares.|`|AypSdbwzaa	You need to take these concerns to the police.  They can deal with him effectively and make sure you are safe at the same time.   There is also the fact that even if you don't go along with his perversity, some one else, some one innocent, might.  You don't want to have to live with knowing he hurt some one when you could have stopped him.<br>  <br>  Take the guy down, you'll feel better when you do!
tx4bRDrXaa	Jesus was not God. First God sends himself?<br>  Why did he name himself Jesus? Why didn't he just say God plain and clear.He did not make the Bible  a mystery not to be explained.He made it for us to get to know him.And the way we got to know him was through Christ Jesus.(John 5:19) Therefore, in answer, Jesus went on to say to them: “Most truly I say to YOU, The Son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he beholds the Father doing. For whatever things that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.<br>  <br>  (Luke 2:49) But he said to them: “Why did YOU have to go looking for me? Did YOU not know that I must be in the [house] of my Father?”<br>  <br>  When Jesus was a little boy he said I am in the house of  my Father was he then a mini-God ?Where was God when Jesus was in the womb who was taking care of heaven?<br>  When you bring up these legitimate questions you get answers you can't see it you don't have the spirit,the Bible was not written to be a mystery for some to understand and some not.<br>  (Acts 10:34-35) At this Peter opened his mouth and said: “For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial, 35?but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.<br>  His word is there for all to understand and want to do his will.The Bible needs no interpretation it has already been interpreted.<br>  This must make Jesus very ashamed to see people giving worship to him and leaving his Father out completely that was never his purpose when he came to the earth.<br>  But we see they let men's doctrines corrupt the truth from the Bible.If there was a trinity the word would be in the Bible.|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Jesus was pre-existent with Father [ John 1:1-3; 17:5;<br>         Colossians 1:17].<br>  Jesus is the Son of God; John 5:18; 6:68-69; 10:30.<br>  Jesus was sinless, as only God can be; John 8:46; 1 Peter 2:21-22;<br>         2 Corinthians 5:21.<br>  Jesus forgives sin, as only God can; Mark 2:7;|`|A01w1dHqaa	Both.

One is Divine & the other is human making Jesus BOTH real God & REAL man. God the Son, as the second person of the Trinity, assumed human nature in the form of Jesus. God the Son did not lose His Divinity by assuming human nature; while at the same time, did not totally ABSORB human nature either to the point of making it meaningless. Jesus often speaks from His REAL human nature which does not possess unlimited knowledge. But Jesus used His Divine Nature to work miracles & forgive sins that only God can perform & do. Thus you cannot use the REAL human nature of Jesus to prove He is not also God since He possesses & acts under BOTH natures.|`|XuO2rTteaa	You asked several questions, so I'll answer them.<br>  <br>  Was Jesus God or God's creation?<br>  Jesus was nether, he was a charicter in a popular fairy tale book. In the book, he was God's son.<br>  <br>  Why would he pray and speak to God if it was himself?<br>  That never made sense to me either. Jesus always said  he was not god, but that doesn't madder to christens.<br>  <br>  How would God be able to die?<br>  Another god killed him? I don't know.<br>  "This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object." -The Joker<br>  <br>  When asked when the world would end why did he say "Only my father knows"? Why would he say "I do nothing of myself; but only as my Father hath taught me"?<br>  Like I said before, Jesus said he was not god, but that doesn't seem to matter.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do some think Jesus was schizophrenic or what?<br>  I think anyone who hears voices in there heads that tells them some weird **** is schizophrenic, that's what schizophrenia is.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	The Trinity is God the father God the Son and God the Holy Spirit . They Make one. You asked who he prayed to and it was God the father.  He died yes but remember he is alive and well today. God the father sent Jesus to earth to teach.|`|x3ZpztsVaa	Isn't it funny how you can babble nonsense (like Earth Angel or No Chance) and get away with it???|`|EZFmUYcSaa	He was begotten, not made.<br>  <br>  mm|`|AA10637643	Jesus is God's Son, literally.  He didn't pray nor speak to Himself, He prayed to the Father and worshipped the Father, as we do.<br>  They are two separate beings.  That is the only possibility.  The trinity makes zero sense.<br>  <br>  Let me add - Christ is Jehovah, the Firstborn in spirit and the Only Begotten in the flesh.  He is God's spirit Son, (Firstborn) and also Christ's physical Father.  And let me repeat, God the Father and Christ God's Son are not the same person/being.  They are united in their devotion, love and purpose, but two separate beings.|`|YimkX6Tzaa	Titus 2:13 looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST.<br>  <br>  Christ Jesus, being in the form of God, made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in the appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. (Philippians 2:6-8) <br>  <br>  But when the fullness of the time (God's appointed time for the coming of Christ) had come, God sent forth His Son (His deity), born of a woman (His humanity), born under the law (His subjection), to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!" (Galatians 4:4-7)<br>  <br>  For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power. (Colossians 2:9)<br>  <br>  JESUS IS GOD.<br>  <br>  Angels were created with the capacity to manifest themselves in physical form as God may will. (Hebrews 13:2)<br>  <br>  Jesus prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will." (Matthew 26:39)<br>  <br>  Saying Jesus is a creation of God indicates that He is a lesser being, equal to the angels.<br>  <br>  And what does Hebrews say about angels?<br>  <br>  Hebrews 1:4 having become so much better than the angels, as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.<br>  <br>  Jesus is better than the angels.<br>  <br>  Galatians 4:6 And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"<br>  <br>  John 20:22 "And when He has said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit could only arrive by Jesus Christ's death on the cross. Receive the Holy Spirit is anticipating the arrival of Pentecost. Then the apostles would be filled with Jesus' Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Acts 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.<br>  <br>   The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Jesus was God made flesh.  He was supernaturally conceived by the holy spirit, but came into the world as we all do, as a baby.<br>  <br>  On the earth, Jesus the Son was subordinate to God the Father.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	When Jesus was on earth he lived as an example to us.  Thus he worshiped to demonstrate how man should worship God.  That is why he prayed, could die, and did what his Father taught him.<br>  <br>  He gave up some of his Godly knowledge while he was a person that is how he could say only my father knows.<br>  <br>  Or what.<br>  <br>  I think I have answered all of your questions.

ntm91alQaa	How psychokinesis works is unknown for certain, but many parapsychologists think that it is a demonstration of the physical influence of a person's brain on the physical world.<br>  <br>  Robert L. Shacklett at Speculations about PK says that laboratory tests demonstrate that "the release of relatively large amounts of physical energy can be triggered by thought power." And this power can move or influence things, essentially, because cosmologically we are all connected to everything else. "'Thought' takes place at a different level than the physical (call it 'mind') but interacts with the physical through a weak coupling between physical energy and a more subtle energy form," he says. "The physical level operates in accordance with natural law except at the times when thought interacts with it."<br>  <br>  How remains the puzzle. But there are theories:<br>  <br>  Some researchers suspect there might be a quantum connection. Unpredictable, often bizarre effects have been documented in the world of subatomic particles, ruled by the perplexing laws of quantum mechanics. Are our minds capable of directing subatomic particles and energies in a way that results in PK phenomena? <br>  One theory is that psychokinesis is the manipulation of a sort of human "magnetic field" around the body, which can be concentrated in a specific area. For this to work, they say, you must be able to relax completely and focus your attention without distraction. <br>  Another speculation is that mediums or participants in a séance are able to coalesce sound or heat waves within a room to form coherent energy which can then be directed at an object, such as a table, causing it to move. <br>  <br>  "Everyone has the potential to be able to be telekinetic," says Deja Allison at Telekinesis on Crystalinks. "Telekinesis is created by higher levels of consciousness. It cannot be created by 'wishing it' to happen on the physical level. The energy to move or bend an object is created by a person's thoughts created by their subconscious mind."<br>  <br>  Spirit Online offers this seven-step method of improving your PK:<br>  <br>  Meditate daily for half an hour, 15 minutes if your schedule is too busy. <br>  Attempt PK at least once a day, twice if possible. Give yourself a good 30-60 minutes to try it. <br>  Focus on one method for at least a week; if it shows no results, switch methods. <br>  Be at ease; instead of taking it too seriously, think of it as an experiment, a game. If you try too hard you'll just end up frustrating yourself and you'll get nowhere. <br>  Don't give up. <br>  Don't tell yourself you can't do it, because you can. <br>  BELIEVE!|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	No.<br>  I suppose I'm not just an atheist but also a apyrokinesist, atelekinesis and a-etc-ist.|`|cECRv4NMaa	Pyrokinesis is a fire starter. Telekinesis is moving things. Both are possible.
6uFaP2OAaa	Well every single uni student I know is studying specific subjects to work towards a specific career.  Even ones studying something as vague  as science or arts knows what job they want when they finish, and are doing the classes that will get them there.  Jobs you wouldn't be able to get if you hadn't completed a degree.<br>  Heading straight into the workforce as soon as you get out of high school isn't for everyone, you know.  Some of us want to get more out of life.
2509779805db68e9ed8f286e83d10b4eaa	I can't explain mystery religions, never studied them. But the appeals of Christianity it that, unlike any other religion the only thing you are required to do is believe that Jesus is who the Bible says He is. If you believe you will accept His sacrifice and as a result of that acceptance your life will slowly (sometime rapidly) change from the inside out. <br>  <br>  There is a new movie out called FIRE PROOF right now. it demonstrates this change (in a rapid condensed version) <br>  <br>  All other religions teach that YOU have to work your way to heaven, Paradise, Nirvana, the next level or what ever it is they are striving for. Jesus did all that for us. So if you accept Him on Gods judgment day you get Christ score. a perfect 100%, a free pass into heaven. <br>  <br>  It is a long story and i will teach you if you want to know it (just email me direct zdaddysdinosaurs@yahoo) but what people see as the "christian" church and "christian" religion is NOT what the Bible teach as a whole. it is, seasoned with Biblical truths, but it is just another dam religion if looked at from the outsider. But looked at through the lens of the Bible you can see true Christianity.

e7Q4RfNsaa	I am sorry that you are confused on this topic--you are not alone. <br>  <br>  Baptism does not wash away sin--it is an outward public display of what has already occurred in the heart of a believer: Realizing that you are a sinner and that your sin separates you from God who is holy. You accept that Jesus, God in the form of man who remained perfect and without sin, died on a cross to pay the penalty of your sins and the sins of every other person who ever lived.<br>  <br>  If you believe this and died before you have the opportunity to be baptized, you would still immediately go to heaven when you die. <br>  <br>  The fact that you are so energized to get baptized is wonderful because the bible teaches us to do so promptly. However, you should not be baptized as part of joining a particular "sect" or with any reservation about what you are doing.<br>   <br>  I pray that this will help settle your heart, but please also read your Bible because all of the answers to these questions are found there.<br>  <br>  "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast" <br>  Ephesians 2:8-9|`|0yTM98Odaa	So most people in this world are walking around with original sin and how did we get this original sin?

And you're sins are already washed away, as soon as Jesus died. But you still need to have a relationship with him though, no freebies. Baptism is just a representation, not the thing that saves you. But we live for that awesome relationship, and if you have that relationship and never get baptized, that would be fine with God.|`|xZet9Dunaa	RICA goes pretty fast some are only 6 months.Baptism is ok in the protestant faith it is the only think the church can except.

According to this Purana, bestowing gifts on deserving persons, fixing one’s thoughts on Lord Krishna, adoration of one’s parents, offering a portion of the daily meal to all creatures and giving a morsel of food to a cow are the characteristics of Dharma.<br>  <br>  According to Matsya Purana, freedom from malice, absence of covetousness, control of the senses, austerity, celibacy, compassion, truthfulness, forbearance and fortitude constitute the fundamentals of Sanatana Dharma.<br>  <br>  Patanjali Maharshi, the exponent of Raja Yoga philosophy, recommends that ten virtues should be practised by all men. The first five are: Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Brahmacharya (celibacy in thought, word and deed), Asteya (non-stealing) and Aparigraha (non-covetousness). These constitute Yama or self-restraint. The other five virtues are: Saucha (internal and external purity), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (austerity), Svadhyaya (study of scriptures or recitation of Mantra) and Isvarpranidhana (consecration of the fruits of all works to the Lord). These constitute Niyama or religious observance.<br>  <br>  The Gita enumerates the following virtues as Daivi-Sampat or divine qualities: fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in the Yoga of Wisdom, alms-giving, self-restraint, sacrifice, study of the scriptures, austerity, straightforwardness, harmlessness, truth, absence of wrath, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of crookedness, compassion to living beings, non-covetousness, mildness, modesty, absence of fickleness, vigour, forgiveness, purity and absence of envy and pride. All these virtues are manifestations of the four fundamental virtues:<br>  <br>  1.  Non-violence,  2. Truth,   3.Purity,   4.Self-control<br>  All the above virtues come under the above four cardinal virtues. The virtues that are enumerated under the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism and the virtues prescribed by Lord Jesus in his Sermon on the Mount, also come under the above fundamental virtues.<br>  <br>  The development of the divine qualities is indispensable for the attainment of Self-realisation. Brahman or the Eternal is purity. The Eternal cannot be attained without the attainment of purity. Brahman is Truth. The Eternal cannot be attained without practising truth. Brahman is fearlessness. The Eternal cannot be attained unless you become absolutely fearless. Attachment to the body causes fear and Dehadhyasa. If only you become fearless, then the identification with the body will vanish.<br>  <br>  You have rendered the heart harder than flint, steel or diamond through greed, miserliness, harshness and rudeness. You can soften it only through the practice of mercy, sympathy, charity, generosity, magnanimity, harmlessness, mildness, disinterested action and untiring service of the poor. You have made the heart crooked and narrow through hypocrisy, untruthfulness, backbiting and tale-bearing. You can expand it through the practice of straightforwardness, truthfulness, purity of heart, alms-giving and non-covetousness. You have rendered the heart impure through lust. You can purify it through the practice of celibacy in thought, word and deed.<br>  <br>  Non-violence<br>  Ahimsa or non-violence is the most important virtue. That is the reason why Patanjali Maharshi has placed it first in Yama. Practice of Ahimsa must be in thought, word and deed. Practice of Ahimsa is not impotence or cowardice or weakness. It is the highest type of heroism. The practice demands immense patience, forbearance and endurance, infinite inner spiritual strength and gigantic will-power.<br>  <br>  Ahimsa is a modification or expression of truth only. Satyam (truth) and Ahimsa always go together. He who is established in Ahimsa can move the whole world. In his presence, all hostilities vanish; lion and cow, cobra and mongoose, live together peacefully. <br>  <br>  [Note: In support of this statement of Swami Shivananda, we cite the example from the life of Sri Ramana Maharshi as observed by the Scottish scientist Alick McInnes. The following extract is taken from the book "The Secret Life of Plants" by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. Chapter titled ‘Dowsing Plants for Health’. The book was first published in 1973. :<br>  <br>  "In South India, Alick McInnes, a Scottish scientist, witnessed the strange spectacle of Sri Raman Maharshi on his evening walk. Within seconds of his leaving his house, cattle tied up in stalls in the village half a mile away would struggle to get out of their ties. When released they careered along the road to accompany the old man on his walk, followed by all the dogs and children of the village. Before the procession had gone very far wild animals and even snakes joined it from the jungle. Thousands of birds appeared, almost blotting out the sky. There were tiny ****, huge kites, heavy-winged vultures and other birds of prey, all flying in harmony around the Maharshi on his walk. When he returned to his room, said McInnes, all the birds, animals and children would quietly disappear."<br>  <br>  -From the book "The Secret Life of Plants" by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird.]<br>  <br>  We continue below with Swami Shivananda’s explanations on the topic of ‘Non-violence’ :<br>  <br>  Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism lay great stress on Ahimsa. Lord Jesus also has emphasised much on Ahimsa in his Sermon on the Mount. He says: "If any one beats you on one cheek, show him the other cheek also".<br>  <br>  He who is firmly established in Ahimsa can hope to attain Self-realisation. He who practises Ahimsa develops cosmic love to a maximum degree. Practice of Ahimsa eventually leads to realisation of oneness or unity of Self. Such a man only can attain self-restraint. Retaliation – tooth for tooth, blow for blow – is the maxim, doctrine or principle of an Asura or a man of diabolic nature. This belongs to the beastly nature. To return good for evil is divine. Constant vigilance and alertness are needed in the practice of Ahimsa. If you are careless even a little bit, you will be carried away by the force of previous wrong Samskara (impression or tendency) and impulses and will become a victim of Himsa (violence), despite your good intentions.<br>  <br>  Truth<br>  Brahman (the Supreme Reality) is Sat or Existence-Absolute. Truth must be observed in thought, word and deed. If you are established in truth, all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Harishchandra sacrificed everything for the sake of truth. He lives still in our hearts. Yudhishthira was also devoted to truth. There is no virtue higher than truth. Practice of truth and Ahimsa constitute the crown and glory of ethical life. In the Taittiriya Upanishad, the preceptor says in his convocation address to the students: "Satyam vada"-Speak the truth. The world is rooted in truth. Dharma is rooted in truth. All religions are rooted in truth. Honesty, justice, straightforwardness and sincerity are only modifications or expressions of truth.<br>  <br>  Purity<br>  Purity comprises both external purity and internal purity. Purity implies both purity of body and purity of mind. Purity of body is only the preliminary to purity of mind.<br>  <br>  The body is the temple of God. It should be kept clean by daily bathing and clean dress. Cleanliness is a part of godliness.<br>  <br>  The restriction in diet is best calculated to make the mind pure. Food exercises a direct influence on the mind. Sattvic food makes the mind pure. Purity of food leads to purity of mind. Mind is only made up of the fine essence of food. As the food is, so is the mind.<br>  <br>  You must be pure in thought, word and deed. Your heart must be as pure as crystal; as pure as the Himalayan snow. Then only the divine light will descend. Purity comprises such virtues as frankness, innocence, straightforwardness and absence of all evil thoughts. He who is endowed with purity will find it easy to tread the spiritual path.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	everyone convert to shinto, it's really really peaceful|`|oVHFz52Laa	We cannot, God can and His judgment is right, Just|`|373KJjiOaa	Leaving aside the hope thing, I believe a religion is peaceful if it cannot be easily interpreted, or misinterpreted, to support violence.

Who that Messiah is? Infact every prophet, even Moses and Jesus (May peace and blessings of ALLAH be upon them) taught their believers to follow the path which was to be shown by the forthcoming prophet. See Bible both old and new testaments for the reference. I will give you the references from Bible as well.<br>  <br>  In the life and after the departure of every Prophet, the followers had to follow the path. In that time the path was right, but on the arrival of new Prophet, the followers had to believe in Him because every new Prophet brought nothing but the same teachings that had been brought by the previous Prophet.<br>  <br>  Like, Abraham (IBRAHIM PBUH) showed the right path by breaking the idols in the shrines and asked the people to inquire the idol of their greatest god, as to who had broken them. It was Abraham (IBRAHIM PBUH) who first used the word “Islam”. Islam means Shalom or Salom in hebrew. Later IS’HAQ (Isaac), YAQUB (Jacob), YOUSAF (Joseph), MOUSA (Moses), DAOUD (David), SALMAN (Salmon), YOUSHA (Josh) and EESA (Jesus) (PBU Them)  i.e. every prophet brought the same message of Islam = Shalom.<br>  <br>  I repeat it again that every Prophet at the time of His departure told the followers to embrace the new Prophet and so did Jesus (PBUH). The world knows that there was no other prophet between the Jesus and MUHAMMAD (PBUH) and neither shall be there any till the day of judgment. So it was the duty of the people to embrace Islam but even then ALLAH ALMIGHTY never ordered Muslims to make people believe in Islam by power or by forcing them. Holy Qur’aan is the biggest evidence on it. Read the history and you will know that every time the war was imposed on Muslims by the European nations in the name of Jesus. Muslims never went in Europe to kill Christians. <br>  Even hindu scriptures shows the truth and arrival of Prophet MUHAMMAD (May Peace and Blessings Of ALLAH be Upon HIM). <br>  I will give you more detail sooner. <br>  Regards,<br>  Khurram.|`|LXWXp921aa	Christians are the same they think every one else's religion is wrong

People are generally very nice to you when you go and I think that you will find it will not matter if you are of Mexican descent or not.  I had a friend who is also of Mexican descent join the church last November and he loves it.  When you become a member they will get you busy in the Priesthood activities and other things for your age group.  My friend is very happy.  He had no direction in his life and smoked a pack of cigarettes a day before he joined.  Now he has a whole ward full of friends. He has found so much happiness and joy and direction by his decision to become a member.<br>  <br>  He wrote this to me, and gave me permission to share it with you:<br>  "Have you seen the movie "The Other Side of Heaven?"  I was watching that today.. and I started thinking, if this Church was not real then why did Heavenly Father allow it to prosper so much?  I just realized that I love the Church, that I love the First Presidency and that I love the Gospel and have accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior.  I did not realize how much I need the Church and guidance of a living prophet, Thomas S. Monson now that I have it. I just, I now have a testimony:  I know that this Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is true, the doctrine is true.  I know that The Book of Mormon is true, I know that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, that we are all children of our Heavenly Father.  I know that we will be with him once again, according to our deeds.  I know that there is no need to do things that pleasure us here on earth since we will be sacrificing our eternal well-being over something that is most likely not worth it.  I know that I am an Aaronic Priesthood holder, that I am a Second Councelor in the Teachers Quorum in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I know that the Holy Ghost is my constant companion, but above all, I know that my Heavenly Father lives, I know that Jesus Christ is His son and our Savior, and I know that the Holy Ghost is our companion to guide and to protect us.  <br>  <br>  Most people who speak negatively about our church have never even come to one of our meetings.  You have.  Did you find that we did anything that made you feel uncomfortable?  I would bet not.  <br>  <br>  You are the best judge of whether you feel good inside when you attend the Mormon church.  Go by what you are feeling this is the Holy Ghost confirming to you that this is Christ's church.  <br>  <br>  I do know that some areas have wards or branches that are mostly all comprised of people of Mexican descent.  I have another friend from Mexico and she felt more at home going to that ward because she could not speak English very well at the time.  The bishop of the ward you are attending now or the missionaries would know if their is one in your area.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and keep on going.  As with anything, the more you go the easier it gets.  Give it a fair chance to do you some good in your life.  Then decide.  Have you read Alma Ch. 32 in the Book of Mormon?  I'm giving you the link here.  It might really help you.

If you have questions, about doctrine, practices, services, individuals' feelings of church members, or otherwise, then you should ask them.<br>  <br>  I love answers to these questions.  There is always a set of folks who profess to be either ex-mormons who have "seen the light" or some who "know the real truth" about Mormonism and then go on to describe a version of Latter Day-Saint theology, and its people, that no believing Latter-Day Saint with even a basic understanding of his or her religion would agree with.  They make sensationalistic statements that no practicing Latter-day Saint would consider fair or and then entreat all to "run, not walk away" before getting a believing LDS perspective.<br>  <br>  If you believe that God has the power to lead you to truth you shouldn't have a need to fear going to any church and being brainwashed.  That is the beauty of the LDS church and its doctrine, member are counseled to continually ask God to let them know if what they are taught, both in and out of the church, is true.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to candidly seek God's guidance to find truth what do you have to fear in visiting any church?  Unless, of course, you believe mormon brainwashing tactics are stronger than God's power to reveal truth to those who seek Him or, as I've seen argued, Satan will answer your prayer when you pray to God about Mormonism (who knew Lucifer could redirect calls to God).  In that case, the only thing that can save you is the personal interpretations of ex-mormons who "know the truth."

You may even be encouraged to limit or completely end relationships with family and friends who express criticism of the church.  <br>  <br>  After a year as a member in good standing, you will be encouraged to receive your ‘endowments’ in an LDS temple. (<a href="http://www.lds4u.com/lesson5/templeintro.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds4u.com/lesson5/templeintro...</a> During this initiation rite you will be ceremonially anointed with oil and water and start wearing the special Mormon underwear. Then you will dress in white clothes with a green apron. The men wear a funny shaped hat, the women wear a veil for the ceremony, which includes learning the special handshakes and passwords you need to know in order to get in to the highest LDS heaven.  You will also be given a new secret name.  During the ceremony, you will learn that obedience is the ‘first law of heaven’ and agree to dedicate everything you have or will have to the church. <br>  <br>  (<a href="http://www.lds4u.com/lesson5/templecovenants.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds4u.com/lesson5/templecoven...</a> <br>  <br>  You will be told to only consider marriage to another ‘worthy’ member, as marriage to a non-member will prevent entry into the highest level of heaven and only a temple marriage has any validity in the eyes of the church.  You will have to exclude your non-Mormon family and friends (including your parents) from this important family event.

However, always remember that you joined voluntarily and you have the right to leave. <br>  <br>  The missionaries are taught to only present a faith-promoting version of church doctrine, history, etc. It's called milk before meat.

Satan would want you to think otherwise and he will do anything to get you to... as evidenced here by others and even by former members.<br>  <br>  What can you expect?  Expect to learn about the Savior, about the scriptures, about the organization of the church and much more.  Read the Articles of Faith to see what we really believe.  Read the Book of Mormon.  Most importantly, keep in constant contact through prayer, with your Heavenly Father.  He will lead and guide you in the RIGHT direction.  <br>  <br>  I love the gospel and know that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints IS truly the church of Jesus Christ and that He personally leads and guides this church through His chosen prophets.

God has given me plenty of answers, some quite powerful that this is the true church- it is my own stubbornness that is holding me back (and that is my own conclusion).  other LDS answered your question about what you can expect, but go with your heart, too. think about how you felt that made you desire this church.  you can find answers to most things that anti mormon people make up or twist truth at websites like farms or shields-research.org or fairlds.org, mormonfortress.com, shakenfaithsyndrome.com, blacklds.org, etc.  people on here say a lot of stupid things- it's hard to know the truth by asking a question on here|`|6DmsiLGbaa	In regards to what?

8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	I agree that wearing an Ankh makes far more sense in representing Christian beliefs then the crucifix. In fact, so too does many other symbols commonly associated with other religions, or cultures.<br>  <br>  But I do think that the marketing of christian products plays a particularly influential role in what modern times christians choose to wear to represent their faith. Walk into any Christian bookstore, and you are overwhelmed by the quantity of Crosses on display. But do you see any Ankhs, pentagrams or the tree of life? Even the fish symbol is extremely under-represented.<br>  <br>  But crosses, well that you can buy in every colour, material, shape and size. You can get those on jewellery, wall hangings, statues, books etc.<br>  <br>  They are given the best marketing positions in the store, and are overly represented throughout other products. So it stands to reason that a lot of christians would eat that up without giving it too much consideration as to whether or not it best accurately describes their views on their own religion. <br>  <br>  But then, that's what the marketing professionals are paid the big bucks to do; make people believe they want something that they might otherwise have overlooked.<br>  <br>  Great question. :)|`|WNWKDw4uaa	"Ankh" if you love Jesus.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	We don't wear ANKH'S because they're SATANIC.<br>  <br>  Instead, we wear crosses with loops in the top so it hangs from our necklaces better.|`|EVby6dGCaa	The cross is the sign of Christian liberation.<br>  <br>  The notion of it being unacceptable due to its being a means of execution is precisely the point. The cross is a means of horrible execution. It is a sign of not only execution, but horrible and disgraceful execution. <br>  <br>  Jesus chose this.<br>  <br>  However, there are two signs here. When one wears a crucifix, one remembers the self-less act of giving himself up for us.<br>  <br>  The usual cross you find, however, is the plain cross, which is an EMPTY cross. Jesus died on the cross, but the cross is now empty, just as the tomb is empty. He rose. That's why most wear the cross.<br>  <br>  Those other things you mention are indeed worn by some, and many, like myself, don't choose to wear anything.<br>  <br>  Telling other people what they ought to want, or what they ought to like, is really pretty tacky, and very poor form.<br>  <br>  Surely you don't fantasize that anyone is going to read your text, slap their forehead, and go out and change their life.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Ankh would have been used only after Constantine.. the EARLY early Christians wouldn't have worn it.

God bless|`|tpDICzslaa	I would be interested to know of any examples of the ankh being used in an ancient  christian context. As a UK based archaeologist I can think of quite a few examples of crossess and chi-rho symbols on artifacts from the first milenium AD, but I can think of no instances of the ankh.<br>  <br>  To give a few examples, sixth century gold crosses were found in the grave of the so-called 'Prittlewell Prince', and crosses appear on the clothes of those depicted in the Christian frescoes from Lullingstone Roman villa. Examples of the use of Chi-rhos can be seen on the late Roman silverware from the Water Newton hoard.<br>  <br>  Can you cite any examples of the ankh?<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteReports.asp?siteid=pr03&section=preface" rel="nofollow">http://www.molas.org.uk/pages/siteReport...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.britannia.com/tours/bmrbgal/waternewton.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannia.com/tours/bmrbgal/w...</a><br>  <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ancient_Roman_frescos_in_the_British_Museum" rel="nofollow">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Catego...</a>|`|AA11705909	I thought it was the sign of the fish that they wore?

Well i personally dont wear a cross, but i can eplain to you why we christians might want to. You are correct in that the cross was a torture mechanism during that time, and it was considered the worst way to die. The Romans would actually put the thieves and murders where people could see so that they could be an example not to go against the Roman law. However, we wear the cross on our necks because the meaning of the cross was totally changed after Jesus died on the cross for us. When Jesus took our spot and died so that we could again be together with God, the cross turned into something beautiful. The cross was the only way that we could be together with God because God is perfect, and we are not. Therefore God cannot be together with us. But God loves us so much that He gave His son to us so that he could take away our impurities and allow us to be together with God as long as we believe.|`|YkQNSPdYaa	The cross is always the better symbol.

Other parts are meant as poetry, and not to be taken literally.<br>  <br>  You cannot say, for example, that a clearly historical section of the Bible is false (such as David being King) while saying the other parts of correct.  There is no logical basis to conclude the some history sections are lies while other is truth.  The tricky thing is the symbolism.  For example, many Christians are that the says of creation are not literal days.  So there is room for honest debate.|`|0fnzDpKXaa	Fact in what way?  Do you mean fact as in historically accurate, or do you mean fact in the sense that it's actually God's word?<br>  <br>  I think some of it has historical worth and some of it is valuable in terms of the moral value of some of the parables and so on.  But I don't think it's God's word in any sense.|`|macZI2dzaa	To be a Christian only takes simple child-like faith.  And, so, yes, some Christians do pick and choose what parts of the Bible to believe and what parts to apply.  <br>  For me, I believe all the Bible.  I have found no significant errors in any of it.  And I have studied it quite deeply.  I do not on the other hand take all of the Bible literally.  Some of it was not intended to be taken literally.  I do take all of  the Bible very seriously.<br>  Oh, and as to Genesis, I have to take it literally.  It is written in the format of a king/servant treaty.  Such legal documents were not and are not offered as allegories or myths.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) So I'm wondering how someone can pick and choose what to believe in and still call themselves Christan.<br>  <br>  This is a common mistake both among Christians and non-Christians.  Your mistaken assumption is that Christianity is based on the bible.<br>  <br>  Before I continue, I would like to make it clear that I am a Fundamentalist Christian who considers the bible to be the foremost authority on Christian doctrine and also wholly true.  Nevertheless...<br>  <br>  For the first 300 years or so of Christianity, there *was* no bible.  Even so, Christianity spread like wildfire during that period.  More:  the Christians we modern Christians revere most lived during that "bible-less" period.  Clearly, you don't even need to know of the existence of the bible to be a good Christian.  Certainly, you don't need to believe everything that such an obviously unnecessary book claims in order to be a Christian.<br>  <br>  To put it more simply:  the bible was a product of Christianity.  Christianity is *not* a product of the bible!  More:  the bible (originally) was made for use by Christians.  It was *not* intended as a tool for converting non-Christians.  For centuries, only the wealthiest of individuals and churches could afford to possess a copy of the bible.  They weren't putting free copies in hotel rooms or passing them out on the streets!<br>  <br>  SO, the bible is *not* the source of Christianity, and it was never intended - originally - to gain new converts to Christianity.<br>  <br>  THAT is why you can choose to not believe everything in the bible and still be Christian.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	Not very much in all honesty.

How can a bible from around 1400 B.C. be still accurate up until 2009? It can't be. I believe that someone wrote it out to have people believe in something when their feeling weak, to believe in something because they can't believe themselves so they have to rely on a fictionalized book and person.

Ao52XHjCaa	I could give a paeon to freedom of conscience, but that masks my uncertainty.  The problem I guess is that these aren't opinions arrived at through reason, but canards that get picked up by people and repeated like slogans until they are effectively true.  There are very few free opinions out there. What they represent are ideas that mangle everything that they touch, silence us and make us look like cowards if we don't engage them. But by engaging them, we end up arguing with insane people. It is insane, for example, to engage with someone who argues that by marrying a human, others will suddenly want to marry horses. Only insane people confuse humans with horses and by arguing with them, we participate in their delusion that somehow the difference between humans and horses is open for debate. Only insane people would spend time arguing against someone who thinks that gay men use hamsters during sex. But we do it in this section all the time.<br>  <br>  But since I don't know how to solve the problem that many trolls are presenting insane ideas and we pretend that they are sane, sure, yeah, free speech.

LjsRfaskaa	From what I 've read about it, the Mayan calendar is made of three different elements. The short count of 365 days, Earths orbit around the Sun. The middle count, 1/12 of the star constellations, about 6'000 year periods or times. And the long count, our solar systems orbit around the centre of our galaxy. This is a massively huge figure, sorry I can't remember off hand. <br>  <br>  On 21st december 2012, it is the winter solstice of all three calenders. Like the second, minute and hour hands of a clock they all line up at midnight on that date. <br>  <br>  Also our solar system is in the middle of a rift in the arm of the milky way. The stars that make up the arm of the milky way appear like a snake wrapping around the centre of the galaxy. And where the rift is, it looks like a snake with its mouth open (the rift) eating its own tail. <br>  <br>  There are many prophesies about the end of times but they all say it is not the end of Earth and what ever is going to happen, it will be followed by a new golden age. You can't have a golden age if we are all dead. So the thing that will change is us. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|WalnRzfGaa	no it was not based on solar events it was based on all of Astronomy.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Let say I write a calendar using a normal sheet of paper.

That does not mean the last day for Earth will be on that year.

It is suggested that this event will cause numerous changes on Earth. However, the event is only a visual phenomenon from the Earth's perspective, which is caused by the precession of the equinoxes or the 26,000 year wobble of the earth, and thus only changes our perspective, not the actual position of the earth in relation to the galaxy. In short, there is no gravitational force or radiation to be expected from this event because other than the tilt of the earth, nothing will be any different from what occurs in any other solstice<br>  <br>  Also a list of what is all important to happen in 2012<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012</a>|`|3ufhBDIVaa	It wasn't based on cosmic events.

Short answer: No but the gods effect the way things are now.<br>  <br>  Long answer:<br>  what we know of ancient Celtic cosmology, from a historical point of view states that something (literally, Old Irish 'That Was' became burned the darkness with fire and ice until everything (literally 'That Is') existed, including the first race of gods, beginning the Mythological Cycle, most of which was rewritten after the arrival of Christianity, to reflect Biblical beliefs. <br>  <br>  There is no creation story because there was no creation.

It is up to each individual to believe whatever way they want to believe.  It does not really matter what was before the Big Bang.  If you believe in God, you probably think that he put the seed of every element of our world in it. And the Big Bang caused further development of this seed.  Then, evolution and creation do not contradict each other.  If you do not believe in God, then hurray to the theory of evolution.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Scientists can tell us exactly what has happened since the big bang.  What they cannot tell us is what happened one second BEFORE the big bang.  Doesn't it make you wonder?|`|YupMCYHlaa	There are different schools of creation theory.  Some Christians insist Genesis is literally true, so the universe can not be older than 6000 years.  Others are looser in their interpretation of Genesis, and allow for the Big Bang being just Gods way of creating the universe.  There are even some 'creationists' who believe in evolution as God's plan to create species.<br>  <br>  Originally, creationism didn't allow for the creation of new species.  God created the earth 'perfect' they believe, and if it was possible for new species to come along then creation would not have been complete.  This theory also did not allow for extinction of species!

Op81lhjuaa	The statistics say that 10 out of 10 people die. It’s true – we all have an appointment with death. A question each of us should ask is “What happens after I die?” The Bible says that God has a standard that he will judge you by on your appointed day of death. It’s called the Ten Commandments. Let’s see how you will do. Have you ever told a lie? (Including white lies and fibs) Have you ever stolen anything? (no matter the value) The third Commandment is “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain”. Have you ever used His name as a curse word to express disgust? The seventh Commandment is “You shall not commit adultery”, but Jesus said “If you look upon a woman to lust after her you’ve already committed adultery with her in your heart”. Have you ever looked at another person with lust or desire? If you said 'yes' to these four questions, then by your own admission you’re a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer-at-heart, and we’ve only looked at four of the Ten Commandments. On Judgment Day, if God were to judge you by those standards, would you be innocent or guilty? Would you go to Heaven or Hell?<br>  <br>  The Bible says that you would be guilty, that means hell. Know that God, the just judge of the universe, is also rich in mercy. He sent His Son Jesus to suffer and die on the cross on your behalf to take the punishment for your sins. He paid your fine with His life's blood. That means God can commute your death sentence. He can allow you to live because of what Jesus did on the cross. Through His death and resurrection, God can now dismiss your case. He can forgive your sins and allow you to live. So what must you do? You must repent - turn from your sins. Don't just confess your sins to God; confess and forsake them. Don't just believe in Jesus - trust in Him, like you would trust in a parachute to save you. You don't just believe in a parachute, you put your trust into it! That's what you must do with the savior.

This is very sad for them and they wish that they had cared and made the effort to know him.<br>  All they wait in their appointed place for the final judgment and the resurrection.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	well I believe it is that when we die (before the rapture) we will be in heaven  ... and our loved ones who are still here on earth will be also called to heaven to wait and we will all descend together <br>  <br>  <br>  Listen to these ..very interesting and enlightening<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sermonplayer.com/c/millbrookchurch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sermonplayer.com/c/millbrookc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sermonplayer.com/c/millbrookchurch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sermonplayer.com/c/millbrookc...</a><br>  <br>  The anarchist is extremely interesting<br>  <br>  God bless :)|`|68lLAQnKaa	Well if you are still alive when Jesus comes back you will meet Him just like the bible says.

Learn a lesson from Job...<br>  Job 40<br>  1.  Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said,<br>   2.  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br>   3.  Then Job answered the Lord, and said,<br>   4.  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<br>   5.  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<br>   6.

Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<br>   9.  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?<br>   10.

Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.<br>   13.  Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.<br>   14.

But he has his free will also, It's just so happen that he chooses to disobey God. After being thrown here on earth without body, God allowed him to temp men, his knowledge before he was thrown on earth were not removed in his memory because he has no veil of forgetfulness of the pre mortal life.|`|pvabglXhaa	God didn't create Satan in the sense of the word.<br>  <br>  God created a beautiful and powerful angel named Lucifer.<br>  <br>  Lucifer got himself some big ideas and a whole heap of false pride who he then leveled at God.  Thinking that he could be on an equal par with God, God then kicked his sorry little butt out of his heavenly home.<br>  <br>  Hence we have who we call Satan and his evil army of angels.<br>  <br>  No turning back for them as they can't repent and get back into God's good books.<br>  <br>  Did God make a mistake?<br>  Some might think so, but there is nowhere in the bible that tells us that angels didn't have free will just like us humans.<br>  <br>  Put is this way, God allowed it to happen.  For reasons we may never understand.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	Satan was not born evil. None of us were. Satan simply became jealous of what God had and tried to gain his own followers through lies.<br>  <br>  As for him being alive today, what better way is there to test people than through enduring Satan's evil system?|`|tYqUutidaa	There cannot be light without darkness<br>  There cannot be coke without pepsi|`|M8X0dIOZaa	God created the angels with free will too. Lucifer (later called Satan) was the most powerful, most beautiful angel God created, and he was created perfect, with a free will. Lucifer decided he wanted to be God. He wanted the other angels to worship him. As soon as that decision solidified in his will God cast him out of His presence, along with any other angel that wanted to worship Lucifer (these angels became what we know as demons). God didn't "let him become so powerful" God made him that way because the job God created him to do required him to be just that powerful. God makes no mistakes. God is much more powerful than Satan. God knew what Lucifer would eventually choose, but God gives us all a chance anyway. God knew all humans would make a wrong choice too, but he never totally wiped out humanity because he gives everyone a chance.<br>  <br>  I would also like to state that light CAN exist without darkness, but darkness CAN NOT exist without light. Light is a something, dark is the absence of something. You can't say that light is the absence of darkness because darkness is a nothing. Light is charged particles that our eyes can perceive. The same with God and Satan. God is light, He is the something. What Satan stands for is the absence of God, which is nothing. God can exist without Satan, but Satan cannot exist apart from God.|`|89cdb3cbba8a715601153fd5acae135faa	God didn't create Satan.<br>  Satan, before, was an angel in heaven, but he chose badly.

Do u know that you can't measure coldness, but u can measure hotness. Cold doesn't exist by itself, it is the absence of hot. Darkness doesn't exist, it is the absence of  light. God didn't create evil, it is the absence of good. If God created sin, who are you to judge or criticize God. We are slaves of God. If God created sin, it is because it is a test for the hereafter. Have you ever taken a test. This life is a test for the hereafter and you will get your result in the herefater. Questioning God doesn't do you any good, you and i have to focus on how to get his mercy and be admitted to paradize.|`|sh78ZSPbaa	Like some of the others hav been saying. <br>  God did not create sin, He created free will. <br>  He didn't want to force anything on us. <br>  God gives every single one of us a choice!<br>  So choose wisely! <br>  Good luck, and I am praying for you!|`|9PoGLVmXaa	You missed the point that He still holds it together today.|`|TwfyliKiaa	If He created sin then it was because to truely be free ALL options must be present for you to choose from.

BUT,  to say, its not our fault because GOD created sin,  THAT isn't an excuse??<br>  <br>  Sorry, does not compute.  <br>  <br>  Religious freewill (which is not an exclusive invention of Christians) puts responsibility on US, who do the things.  We don't convenienently peg the responsibility on the one who gave us the choice. <br>  <br>  Using your logic.. I guess the person who created Ice Cream and sugary Soda Pop should be to blame for my obesity..right? 'cause utlimately, THEY created the things that made me fat..I wouldn't have the choice if they didn't create it...right?<br>  <br>  WOW!,  all I can say is WOW! -- nice piece of hypocritical logic there.  <br>  <br>  The removal of Freewill make us ALL victims.  Victims of our biology, Victims of our genes,  Victims of society, Victims of how our parents raised us,  -- Poor, pathetic VICTIMS.   I refuse to be a victim, so I believe I have Freewill to CHOOSE my actions, therefore while God may have granted me freewill, in a very real sense, what I do with it is MY decision, not his, so he isn't responsible for my sins.  I AM. <br>  Otherwise, I'm a poor, pathetic, powerless victim of the universe.<br>  <br>  I guess you would prefer that God had NOT created any of this?  OR that God make us all little robots?  OR that God gave us Freewill, but somehow put limits on it, so we can't make mistakes?  Protected us from our own nature -- is that what you are advocating?  So you are ANGRY at God for being too lenient?  for allowing BOTH potentials to exist.  You want God to be MORE controlling? -- I'm Glad YOU aren't god, that's for sure. hehehehehehe<br>  <br>  Here's how I see it. <br>  <br>  God knew full well the potential and likely outcome of freewill.  BUT, if you think about it.. he gave us a CHOICE to have freewill or NOT. <br>  <br>  Think about the Garden of Eden and the Tree of knowledge... Before Adam and Eve ate of the Fruit, they didn't even KNOW about Freewill,  they didn't even KNOW they could disobey God.  <br>  The Potential was always there..but they didn't know it. God gave them the choice to have choice. Had they and none of us SINCE them.. eaten of that tree..we wouldn't even KNOW about original sin, about disobeying God..we'd be soo innocent and nieve. <br>  So God, in his wisdom, gave us the CHOICE to have choice.  That's pretty cool, I think.  He didn't even force Freewill on us. <br>  Adam and Eve had the Freewill to have freewill...or maybe not. <br>  <br>  Sorry you feel like a poor pathetic Victim.  I don't.<br>  ___________________<br>  <br>  NOW, if you really want to dig into it.. I could start using sematics and argue that God didn't "CREATE" sin, because sin isn't a THING, but the absense of a thing.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you've ran into the "hole" analogy.  Is a hole a thing?<br>  Can you pick up a hole? Can you sell a hole?<br>  Answer: NO<br>  <br>  A HOLE is not a thing, but the absense of a thing. We refer to it as a thing...but it is not.  We only know when there is a hole by denoting the lack of dirt.  We see what is missing and we immediately recognize what is missing and call that something.<br>  <br>  Therefore, God couldn't CREATE sin.. because SIN is the absense of Good.  Is acting Contrary to the ultimate good.  We only recognize sin, as sin,  because we understand that it is contrary to good.  <br>  Case in point... many people do see the "wrong" with pornography, so they don't see it as a sin.  They fail to see how it is counter productive to good, and therefore to them it is not sin.  This illustrates how sin is not a THING, which can be created,  BUT the absense of a thing. <br>  <br>  SO, in a very true sense.. God ONLY created GOOD.  Freewill is a GOOD, BUT, it carries with it a Potential ideal to NOT do good.  We call this "thing" which is devoid of good "SIN"  -- but it is the lack of something... and not something in and of itself. <br>  <br>  SO, in the FINAL analysis.. God didn't CREATE Sin.. he created GOOD.<br>  <br>  BUT.. I hate semantical arguments....because they are so legalistic.  So I won't make that particular argument but I could.<br>  <br>  hehehehehehe<br>  j/k<br>  :)|`|AA11297267	I like "sin."

Free will implies a choice.  Choosing the option that is less good is sin.<br>  <br>  You might not like that answer, but it's still the answer to your question.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Anytime anything is created it's antithesis is also created.   If I make a Ham Sandwich then the lack of ham sandwich also exists.  Likewise, God created life and death immediately came into being as it's antithesis.  Along with that all the other things God created have their antithesis doing good vs. doing evil, etc.  so by default God created evil or sin, but not directly.<br>  <br>  One caveat.  The bad cannot exist without the good, but good can exist without the bad.  We can conceive of having life without having death ie. eternal life, but we cannot have death without ever having life this would be non-existence not death.|`|SC7sxZDMaa	HOW DARE YOU QUESTION MY STUPID RELIGION!!!|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	OK... have a good life Y'all... sin free of course|`|BABcrdMKaa	On the first page of genesis, it says God created everything, the dark and the light "and [that] he saw it was good"<br>  <br>  its just a blame game|`|RedEGIfZaa	God obviously created evil, because Adam and Eve were punished for eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.<br>  <br>  How could such a tree exist if evil didn't exist beforehand?|`|AA11883252	So true, God (according to the bible) created evil.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT-Not everyone has free will.

After all, he is omniscient; he knew what was going to happen. If god does not desire that his will be disobeyed, why did he tell Adam and Eve not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and then CREATE an animal whose express purpose was to tempt them into eating from the tree of knowledge? <br>  <br>  On an icy winter morning, would you warn a friend to be careful and not slip as he leaves his house, and then smear grease on his front step?<br>  <br>  Either way, this does not reflect well on the god of the bible. He created an evil, talking snake, set it loose in Eden, and neglected to warn Adam and Eve about this danger. How can this be explained? Did god want Adam and Eve to sin?  Or perhaps the god of the bible is simply malevolent?|`|YkQNSPdYaa	"Remember, "god" is nothing more than a nonsense word created by man to explain away all of the things we can't yet understand.<br>  <br>  Religion is a disease of the mind, born of fear, which has done nothing but bring untold misery down upon the human race." says the big fool.|`|qtCVLDFxaa	*** sigh... ****<br>  so much anger....|`|lbGVdgr1aa	God didnt create sin<br>  <br>  The downfall is man's quest for knowledge.

I bet if you didn't have freewill you would be one of the sorest person on earth. Don't you think it's good we have freewill as humans? Okay so God gave us freewill therefore enabling us to choose to or not to do somethings. God created the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and instructed us not to eat of it; that was an instruction and man disobeyed God and fell. So man is responsible for damnation unto ourselves. We didn't create sin but by disobeying God we sinned. And it doesn't go to say that b/c God gave us freewill and we disobeyed him He created sin. No! Have you ever thought where humanity would be if Eve and Adam hadn't eaten of the apple (fruit, not sure if it was apple)?|`|yMVdKHhmaa	because we live in a non dualistic world where everything is part of the One, if there is good there will be bad, they are not separate things but two parts of the same one.<br>  like Hot is not hot and cold is not cold they are only differences in temperature.

God gave us free will. He wanted us to make choices. And sometimes we choose wrong. That's a risk He's willing to take, because he provided His only begotten son to suffer for our sins. That way when we do sin, we can take the necessary steps to overcoming that and becoming a better person, and getting closer to reaching exaltation.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	Yes, God created man, Satan, and yes He granted us free will.  <br>  <br>  God created man to be in a relationship with Him.  Why?  I'm not exactly sure.  Why did He create angels?  I'm not really sure there either.<br>  <br>  Why free will?  The only reason I know of that is that He didn't want robots for friends.<br>  <br>  Did He create sin?  Well, maybe it depends on how you define it.  "Sin" is a result of man's (or angel's) choice to reject God.  Sin is pride.  Pride, in the Biblical sense, means we think we're better, smarter, more powerful than we actually are.  <br>  <br>  Maybe man fails to see God for who He is in contrast to who we are.  God is the creator, we're the created.  How can we possibly fathom who we've come from?  <br>  <br>  Think about what it's like to have a baby.  You've helped create this little life and when they're born, they know virtually nothing.  They can't possibly understand what it takes to create and raise them.  What about a 12 year old who mouths off about how their parents don't love them?  Do you think that child understands what their parents have given up for them out of love??  Why do parents make rules and discipline their children?  Because they hate their children?  How would the child know the difference between right and wrong if their parent didn't tell them?  And at some point the parents have to let the child begin making decisions for themselves.  It's out of love and respect for the child, is it not?  This is one way that I believe God views us.

Izn1ye9Raa	Assalaamualaykum. Rabbi Al Awwal started yesterday (february 25, 2009). Today is Rabbi Al Awwal 2, 1430.|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Rabi' al-awwal (???? ?????) is the third month in the Islamic calendar. Prophet Muhammad is considered by Sunni Muslims to have been born on the twelfth of this month, and many Muslims celebrate the Mawlid on this day. Shi'a Muslims believe him to have been born on the dawn of the seventeenth day. The name means the first month and the beginning of spring.<br>  <br>  The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Rabi al-Awwal migrates throughout the seasons. The estimated start and end dates for previous Rabi' al-Awwal are as follows:<br>  <br>      * 1426 AH – First day: April 10, 2005; last day: May 9, 2005<br>      * 1427 AH – First day: March 31, 2006; last day: April 29, 2006<br>      * 1428 AH – First day: March 20, 2007; last day: April 18, 2007<br>      * 1429 AH – First day: March 9, 2008; last day: April 7, 2008<br>  <br>  For the present one, the Astronomical new moon is on February 25, 2009 (Wednesday) at 1:35 UT. On Feb 25, this moon was not visible in Australia or most of Asia. In Europe only telescopic sighting was possible on Feb 25. On the same day, there is some chance to see it in Northern parts of South America and there is a reasonable chance of sighting in North America. In Hawaii, it should be easily visible on Feb 25. For most of the rest of the world it was visible on Feb 26, 2009.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .

kGkUG0fKaa	I live in the Twin Cities, St. Paul/Minneapolis and yes, it differs greatly from NY and LA which are two of the most expensive cities in the country. The cost of living in those two places, double by the cost of living in Minneapolis but if you are in Minneapolis such as Uptown or Downtown then the cost is very high because of the condos and vintage style apartment lofts. And those are the only two places I would suggest living in Minneapolis or else it just isn't worth it, going over South which is okay or over North which is not okay.<br>  <br>  to compare apartment prices go to apartments.com or rent.com and there you will get a sense of the apartment prices in the cities you choose to live in. I will say that LA is cheaper than NY ( I have family in both cities/states)|`|EmOnt7FIaa	In NYC and LA, the cost of living is ridiculous. Even if you move to the poor/ghettos than housing is still expensive. In the suburbs of these cities, things are very expensive. The most expensive cities are LA, San Francisco, San Diego and New York

UmjJmYsjaa	Why not go preach door to door like the apostles did? Not asking for money but talking about Jesus and the Gospels.<br>  <br>  What you are proposing to do is none biblical. What would Jesus do? Didnt he preach extensively for three years, and the apostles after that continued until they died.<br>  <br>  Does the bible support such actions as 'Ghost Hunting'? When did Jesus ever go Ghost hunting?<br>  <br>  Edit: Maybe that is why your Church is closing down, Maybe you are not doing what Christ told you to do.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Do this and you will grow:<br>  <br>  1.

T shirts and things of that nature (iron ons are great and pretty inexpensive) make nice momentos for both online and offline events..and getting involved in the Community through events to raise money for local charities helps alot, helps to raise awareness.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest posting ads in papers, and last but not least..<br>  <br>  A church doesn't need a big fancy building to be a Church. Pick a local park or other venue and meet there if the church should sadly be shut down. Keep working on building up the funds to begin again, but remember, the church is made of it's members. Agree to meet every Sunday somewhere for prayers and activities. <br>  <br>  It may not be the same, but you might be pleasantly surprised how much of a good thing a change can be.<br>  <br>  I am High Priestess of a Temple that began online, we are Unitarian (encompassing all Paths.) It was merely a dream that we would have offline Gatherings, and that came to pass through the desire and determination of it's members. We never thought we would get so far as to have an offline Gathering place for us to commune, and that has come to pass very recently, and it is such a blessing.<br>  <br>  Never give up hope!<br>  <br>  Gods Bless!

A complete description of the Aura and its colors was provided by Charles Leadbeater, a theosophist of the 19th century.[2] The works of Leadbeater were later developed by Palamidessi[3] and others.<br>  <br>  Skeptics such as Robert Todd Carroll contend that auras may be seen for explainable reasons such as migraines or synesthesia.[4] Some people see auras as the result of a migraine, epilepsy, a visual system disorder, or a brain disorder.[5][6] Eye fatigue can also produce an aura, sometimes referred to as eye burn.|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	"What are auras"<br>  <br>  A side effect of some kinds of medication and illegal substances...<br>  <br>  <br>  "How and why do people see them?"<br>  <br>  No, look, "imagine" isn't spelled s-e-e, it's i-m-a-g-i-n-e<br>  <br>  <br>  "Are they spiritual or a psychological phenomenon?"<br>  <br>  Neither, they're retarded.|`|cdFqekzZaa	It's energy given off by the body.

aWcD7Ou5aa	Never tell anyone your secrets, not even a 'friend'.  Friends come and go.  Do you have anything to spread about her?   If you do, she may think twice before she talks about you.  I'm sorry, there's not much you can do about this unless you make up with her.You can always make up with her and back off slowly from her, so slowly that you let your friendship just kind of fade out, instead of ending it on a bad note.  If that is not an option, you're just going to have to suck up whatever she says about you and realize that when you're young, there's a new drama every day, so people will forget about your drama soon.  Please learn a lesson from this, don't tell your secrets.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Don't be her friend if you feel like its risky x|`|adcCJrNxaa	First of all "friends" have arguments.

I really don't think if shhe was your friend like you said shhe would betray your trust so fast. Even if yall friendship does go wrong I don't think shhe would tell your secrets. Stop stressin about this! I also personally believe that if you tell your friend your concerns about her/him telling your secrets you're just planting the idea in her/his head to do such a thing. Also she/he might get even more mad at you b/c you don't really trust her by suggesting she/he would do such a thing.

5gKg5S0vaa	Why do you want to be an atheist? I am agnostic but I tend to lean towards atheism because personally that is what makes sense to me.  If you have this sense of the existence of god why don't you just embrace it.  It doesn't mean you have to become religious and go to church just accept your feelings and if you want to, explore them by researching different beliefs, it may help you to reconcile your feelings.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	I think your agnostic then. You can't be atheist when you keep willing yourself to believe it because deep down you know you do if your saying all that stuff. <br>  Atheism is something people believe in not something they force themselves to believe.|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	God wont let you be snatched from his hand.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	I have felt this same way for a very long time now. I feel that there has to be some higher power. I feel that religion is too complicated and it isn't right for me. I've tried to be atheist because everything I have ever heard about God feels so wrong. He can't be that judgmental, vengeful being who condemns people and allows bad things to happen to innocent children. I have tried to tell myself he doesn't exist but when things are at their worst or even at their best I find myself casting my eyes heavenward and doubting my own conviction.<br>  It all comes down to this: I can't stop myself from hoping, even if logic tells me it is ridiculous. I don't know for sure. But my strongest conviction tells me that nobody else knows for sure either. So I choose to live a good, moral life because I feel it is right. And when things are bad, I pray. Whether my prayers are being heard or not, I don't care. It just makes me feel better. I don't analyze or rationalize, and I NEVER listen to religious judgments or justifications. I don't read the bible because the one thing I'm positive of is that it's a bunch of crap. I do what's right for me and my family.|`|pvabglXhaa	Ask God to make himself real to you<br>  <br>  Seek and ye shall find my friend<br>  <br>  Deep down you know He is there.

Forget all the advice(including mine) and go with your OWN advice.|`|Q2qKxHONaa	It can be confusing sometimes trying to figure out what is true about God. If God wanted us to know about Him, He would tell us. It seams logical that if He has revealed things about Himself, He would give us proof that His words were genuine. There is a book that was written over a period of a thousand years by about forty different authors from every walk of life which has one overall theme and contains no contradictions and claims to be the word of God. Of course, there are those who will say anything to get people to think of it as a book of fairy tales, but if you believe everything that people say you'll never find the truth. I encourage you to read the Bible for yourself. Everything you've heard about it and what it teaches is probably a lie.|`|F2ZtErtbaa	hey man dont feel bad, i men i understand what you mean. like how could God exist in such a corupt world right? but i always look back to when i was going through tough times i noticed i never felt alone and i guess God was with me through all of the bad and the good. well what im tryin to say is, if you feel Him there then why do you want to try and ignore the feeling like if it wasnt, just accept it you cant try to be something youre not.<br>                              hope i was helpful enough=)|`|YHTGTQ9caa	It's like your smart but the dumb thoughts keep tugging on you.<br>  I've seen the opposite of this a lot, where theists come to the obvious realization that God is a myth.|`|Mt4fBeyNaa	Those are the Martians you're feeling.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	The life on this Earth is such a blink of an eye when placed next to the millennia our souls will live after.<br>  <br>  Everything has a LIFE SPAN - people, animals, plants, rocks, diamonds, dirt, gases, cells, molecules, the sun and moon, meteorites, comets, cosmic dust, etc....  Something always comes from something else. But where did the first "something" come from? Since "something" can't come from "nothing", then the first "something" had to come from the only source that doesn't have a life span: God.<br>  <br>  It's only logic.

You aren't. Great.|`|jBYxEX8taa	You lack so much understanding. Also, you're asking like 50 questions at once. If you want anyone to give you good answers then take it slower.<br>  <br>  God gave man free-will to choose to sin or not to sin, we dont HAVE to sin. That's why His laws are there. Would you prefer it if God made you a robot so you have no choice? He doesn't want to force people to worship Him, He wants them to decide for themselves. <br>  <br>  God does forgive the sinner, if you repent and accept Jesus christ into your life. But you need to ask Him for forgivness. Satan doesn't MAKE people sin, he only tempts them to sin. Unfortunately, we fall into temptation sometimes, which results in sin. Luckily, we can be forgiven if we repent.|`|gXJdryRNaa	God gives us all choices as to which path to follow.  It is up to us to decide which path to choose.  With each choice comes a reward or a penalty.  Oftentimes we don't know what the outcome will be on any given path until we get there.<br>  <br>  God is a loving God.  But He knows that people are going to make mistakes and it is then up to us to seek His forgiveness and His counsel and to try to  make things right.<br>  <br>  It is only through Him that we are complete.  That is my personal belief.<br>  <br>  For me, it's a Leap of Faith.|`|cB2VGhLgaa	If you are going to ask, how can people believe in Christianity?

People want those things. God gave us life. We made life the way it is. Satan tempts people with the things they attracted to. God knew we would sin and made a plan to forgive all people of their sin. He became the sacrifice for all sin. A perfect man to die for an imperfect people. His blood pays for all sin of all people, because He is God.<br>  <br>  God does not send any one to hell. We are going to hell because we are sinners. God offers eternal life.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	God is not in control of everything.  He gave up complete control by giving man freewill.  If man chooses a way that God doesn't approve of then why should God be blamed for the results?|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	God said directly that he is Jealous.|`|8VeiQNRBaa	I know there is a God because every day I spend time with him!!|`|2IILBm42aa	How can people believe in christianity?<br>  Its fairly simple:<br>  God wants us to be curious and doesn't want us to know everything. it all has a purpose atheists (my opinion) were put on earth as an obstacle and whoever wins that obstacle gets to go to heaven. God is saving everything good for heaven but first you must learn from your mistakes and change them for there will be a day with no more tears and no more fears... Please change your life and look for god in yourself. Im a hypocrite some times but at leastI have the whole spirit and savior inside of me|`|O8n3FYK0aa	WOW! That's a lot of questions! I'll do my best. God has a plan for everything, we may think it's totally nonsense and we can't understand it, but it he works all things for his glory. He has given people the freedom of choice, and therefore some will choose wrongly. And if people choose differently, then there will be disagreements, resulting sometimes in fighting. I don't believe that He wants the whole world to be fighting. No, God is not Satan. I don't believe that God gives people the idea to sin, I think that He allows Satan to tempt us. <br>  <br>  One day the angels [a] came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan [b] also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" <br>        Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it." <br>   8 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil." <br>   9 "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied. 10 "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face." <br>   12 The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." <br>        Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD. "<br>  <br>  That was Job 1:6-12, this explains how we have the urge to sin. <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 10:13 says <br>  "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it." <br>  <br>  So, whenever we are tempted, (by Satan) God gives us a way out of the temptation, without sinning.No, He doesn't want anyone to suffer. Correct, Satan does give people the temptation to sin. God doesn't want to send anyone to hell, but His standards are so high and he is such a perfect God that he cannot tolerate even the smallest sin. Yes He knows about Satan, they were once in heaven together, but then Satan, decided that he wanted more, and so he fell and as a result was kicked out of heaven (which was all part of God's plan). Like the verse above says, there is no temptation from which you cannot escape, it's just a matter of what you choose. Yes, God does send people to hell for sinning, but only because they didn't choose his Son as their savior. Just because man is bad and makes bad choices, doesn't mean that God is bad. Well, I'm sorry I couldn't answer all your questions, but I did the best I could to answer the ones I could. Hope this helps, and that you find whatever you are looking for. Please email me if you have any other questions, or comments. I would be glad to talk to you. Thanks for posting.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	"With all of its stupid contradictions."<br>  give me 1 contradiction.<br>  <br>  "If god can control everything why would he put atheists on the Earth to detest him?"<br>  he didn't make them atheists, and he created them because they have a purpose, for instance they could have a kid that becomes Christian, or they may sometime before they die become Christian themselves.<br>  <br>  "Why would he want people on Earth going through huge conflicts over his existence. If he wants the whole world fighting, would that not make him Satan?"<br>  he said told people who he was and gives us the choice to listen to him or not, he wants us to choose to love him, he doesn't want us to be robots.<br>  <br>  "So is God Satan?"<br>  no<br>  <br>  "Why would God give people the idea to sin if they will be punished for it?"<br>  again, it is because he wants us to choose to love him. he said "please love me" and we chose to turn away from him and do evil (sin)<br>  <br>  "He wants people to suffer?"<br>  no, but God being Holy has to punish sin<br>  <br>  "But if this is true why would God send anybody to hell, if he is all knowing, he must know about Satan."<br>  see the question above this 1.... and he does know about Satan, after all Satan, though he hates God has to get God's permission to do anything.<br>  <br>  "If Satan gives people Irresistible urges to sin, than God should be able to know that and forgive the "sinner"."<br>  Satan does not give people irresistible urges to sin (God wouldn't allow it) but instead he gives us urges to sin and instead of fighting it we often time just go straight for the sin.<br>  <br>  "Really, this is all bullshit."<br>  to you, and only because you do not understand Christianity.|`|hZRcQXOVaa	Ok, God knows that everyone sins of course they do. But, he didn't want everyone to have to believe in him, then we would just be robots. He gave us free will since he wants us to love him without being forced. No matter how many times you sin God still loves you. He just wants you to ask for forgiveness. God is not Satan. <br>   <br>  hope it helps

Gf5nMPJXaa	If you think this is the worst of possible worlds you have a serious lack of both historical knowledge and imagination.<br>  <br>  There is no "calm serenity" of nonexistence.  Nonexistence is null.  Not like sleep.  Not like meditation but a complete cessation of all experience and sensation.  <br>  <br>  Would I prefer that if my life really were a constant torture for which there was no possible relief?  Sure.  But, as for most people, that's not the case.  There are plenty of ways to enjoy life, and none whatsoever to enjoy death.<br>  <br>  So to answer briefly, the reason is "opportunity cost".  Unless you have no possibility of ever finding anything enjoyable or pleasant in life again, the opportunity of trying to do so is likely to be more beneficial than the irrevocable end of all experience that suicide causes.|`|WxlwpEDbaa	Most people will dismiss you as crazy.

n7bok7NRaa	If you're talking about the major belief systems, they are most generally centered on races:<br>  <br>  Night Elves: Believe in a moon diety named Elune - she is the source of their priestly powers, and traditionally dwelt in the Well of Eternity (until it blew up). They also revere Cenerius, who is the son of Elune, and the source of druidic powers. They also have pacts with Ysera, the Green Dragon Aspect.<br>  <br>  Humans: Believe in a "goodly force" that is called "The Light", this empowers their priests and paladins. There are some other humans who likely revere (or simply respect, as a scientist might respect science) arcane magic. Praticitioners of the Arcane often become addicted, and some may turn to the Burning Crusade to gain "demonic" powers.<br>  <br>  Dwarves: As humans, they believe in the Light, which empowers their priests and paladins. They have no arcane connections, but they do have strong connections to the Titans (who are the creator deities of warcraft.)<br>  <br>  Draenei: As humans and Dwarrves, the believe in the Light. they also have a natural inclination towards arcane magic, but their deep faith in the Light keeps them on the straight and narrow (away from demonic power).<br>  <br>  Gnomes: Believe in Science or magic. They have no force keeping them from being corrupted, thus they often do walk down the path of the warlock.<br>  <br>  Orcs: Believe in elemental forces and shamanism. They align themselves with the elements to gain power and wisdom. Some orcs still walk the old path of corruption by demonic forces and thus become warlocks.<br>  <br>  Trolls: Believe in animal spirits and worship them as gods, and allow those spirits/loa to take over their bodies - as a form of voodoo witch doctor type magic. Some Trolls practice shamanism or arcane magic, and others worship the great snake and gain dark knowledge from it (priests). They all believe in loa, black magic and voodoo, and as such they do not mess with forces they they cannot control (and thus are never warlocks). <br>  <br>  Tauren: Believe in the great Earth Mother - she may well be the elemental lord of earth, and thus may actually be an evil force, but since she is safely contained, she has no real influence over the Tauren. Earth Mother may also simply be a euphemism for the ground the Tauren walk on. Through their worship of the earth (as well as ancestor spirits and animal spirits) they have some to embrace shamanism. They are the ones who taught Shamanism to the Horde, which is why horde totems look like little Tauren.<br>  <br>  Undead: Are simply humans who have been raised from the dead. They still believe in the light, but through their corrupted state can only access certain parts of it.<br>  <br>  Blood Elves: Believe in the power of arcane magic. So much so that their whole society became addicted to it. they had some contact with the light, but on the destruction of the Sunwell, many elves turned to demonic power to feed themselves. This corruption marred their contact with the light, making it impossible for their priests to function. Thus they launched a new plan to manipulate the light via arcane know how.  They do not revere the light (even now that the Light well has been restored) they view it as just another form of magic to learn and train in.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for which is predominant, none of them really are - nor are any of them participating in the whole truth of the Warcraft universe. There's plenty of lore that a player can know about the origins of the warcraft universe that simply do not reflect in any of the major religions of the races.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Rio Ferdinandism.|`|EXurNsB4aa	"Basement-dweller"|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Noobianity|`|2tbVJfHdaa	Each one is correct.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.YehforGames.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.YehforGames.com</a><br>  Yeh! for Games, Inc. is an American company that helps you get levels and PvP gear on World of Warcraft.<br>  1.

Lk4aCBACaa	There is no such thing as one "perfect/true/correct" religion and anyone who tells you there is has an obvious bias. Such claims - like most religious beliefs - can neither be proven or disproven, and only create animosity and conflict. Given the number of people who claim their way is the right way, it's impossible for some of them not to be wrong! LOL<br>  <br>  Not all religions even believe in a heaven, or that kind of reward vs. punishment afterlife.<br>  <br>  At any rate, all religious people have only their own personal experiences and intuition to go on, neither of which constitute any kind of "proof" to anyone but themselves. You don't need to have a religion, but if you choose to have one, pick the one that most closely matches things you already believe and go from there. :)|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	if you're atheist, why do you think there is a heaven to begin with?<br>  <br>  avoid them all.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The only "religion" that has salvation and truth in it is the one you can find in the pages of the bible.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ, and the cross, should be at its center.|`|332vXA6oaa	The Jehovah's Witnesses are the only true religion.

Also we don't get paid for preaching the word, everything we do is voluntary. We don't believe in tithing, you give what you want, and if you want to.

But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account.  [3:19]<br>  <br>  Say: "Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a way that is straight,- a Religion of right,- the path (trod) by Abraham the true in Faith, and he (certainly) joined not gods with Allah."  [6:161] <br>  <br>  Who can be better in Religion than one who submits his whole self to Allah, does good, and follows the way of Abraham the true in Faith? For Allah did take Abraham for a friend.

[3:83] Say: "We believe in God, and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in (the Books) given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord: We make no distinction between one and another among them, and to God do we bow our will (in Islam)." [3:84]  If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to God), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good). [3:85]<br>  <br>  And thou dost see the people enter Allah's Religion in crowds, [110:2]  Celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and pray for His Forgiveness: For He is Oft-Returning (in Grace and Mercy). [110:3]  <br>  <br>  The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.

[3:19]<br>  <br>  “The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah”<br>  (SharaAAa lakum mina alddeeni ma wassa bihi noohan)<br>  <br>  The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him). [42:13]  And they became divided only after Knowledge reached them,- through selfish envy as between themselves. Had it not been for a Word that went forth before from thy Lord, (tending) to a Term appointed, the matter would have been settled between them: But truly those who have inherited the Book after them are in suspicious (disquieting) doubt concerning it.[42:15]  <br>  <br>  “The religion of Truth”<br>  (Deena alhaq)<br>  <br>  It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.

AA11989753	Jesus Christ said to "lust" after another IS a SIN. The scripture says that "when lust has conceived, it bringeth forth sin." That means to entertain lustful thoughts will eventually bring forth actions to those thoughts (which is sin) and sin brings forth death.  There is no justification for sin, but there certainly is a final consequence which is death and then judgment!<br>  <br>  "Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death."  James 1:15 (KJV)<br>  <br>  "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, after that comes judgment."  Hebrews 9:27 (KJV)<br>  <br>  Added: If one is TRULY born again of the Spirit of God, God has given him a new nature. That new nature has a new desire to do the things of God and to do His will. Poronography is not listed anywhere in God's will.  At the time of Salvation, God sealed us with His Holy Spirit. When we sin, that same Holy Spirit that we were sealed with GRIEVES.  We are told in God's Holy Word not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God. When we do this, it creates distance between us and God.  Remember, God cannot be in the presence of sin.  We, by our own choice when we choose to sin, distance ourselves right out of fellowship with God. Until we repent of our sins, and ask God's forgiveness, then and ONLY THEN can we move back into a right relationship again.<br>  <br>  "If we say we are without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us; if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>  1 John1:8-9 (KJV)|`|n0uMBKtJaa	That's called lust buddy, I think that for a Christian lust is bad.

yc6S4iHDaa	If you are wondering if your friend is in heaven, then we cannot answer that question accurately here. If you want to know if he MIGHT be in heaven, then here is what we know about it...<br>  <br>  1) God is merciful. As long as your friend was a good person he will go to heaven as long as no mortal sins are on his soul.<br>  2) God loves those that do not know him. If your friend was not religious, as long as he lived a good life he probably went to heaven. <br>  <br>  The person "Jesus is God" is biblically incorrect. By his logic, you could be a horrible person but praise God as savior and enter into heaven.<br>  <br>  God is practical.

(Ec 9:5,?10; Ps 146:4) Those dying are described as going into “the dust of death” (Ps 22:15), becoming “impotent in death.” (Pr 2:18; Isa 26:14) In death there is no mention of God or any praising of him. (Ps 6:5; Isa 38:18,?19) In both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures, death is likened to sleep, a fitting comparison not only because of the unconscious condition of the dead but also because of the hope of an awakening through the resurrection. (Ps 13:3; Joh 11:11-14) The resurrected Jesus is spoken of as “the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death.”—1Co 15:20,?21; see HADES; SHEOL.<br>  <br>  Whereas the ancient Egyptians and other peoples of pagan nations, and particularly the Grecian philosophers, were strong in their belief in the deathlessness of the human soul, both the Hebrew Scriptures and the Christian Greek Scriptures speak of the soul (Heb., ne′phesh; Gr., psy?khe′) as dying (Jg 16:30; Eze 18:4,?20; Re 16:3), needing deliverance from death (Jos 2:13; Ps 33:19; 56:13; 116:8; Jas 5:20), or as in the Messianic prophecy concerning Jesus Christ, being “poured out .?.?. to the very death” (Isa 53:12; compare Mt 26:38). The prophet Ezekiel condemns those who connived “to put to death the souls that ought not to die” and “to preserve alive the souls that ought not to live.”—Eze 13:19; see SOUL.<br>  <br>  Thus, The Interpreter’s Bible (Vol. II, p. 1015), commenting on 1?Samuel 25:29, observes that “the idea of man as consisting of body and soul which are separated at death is not Hebrew but Greek.” (Edited by G.?Buttrick, 1953) Similarly, Edmond Jacob, Professor of Old Testament at the University of Strasbourg, points out that, since in the Hebrew Scriptures one’s life is directly related with the soul (Heb., ne′phesh), “it is natural that death should sometimes be represented as the disappearance of this nephesh (Gen. 35:18; I Kings 17:21; Jer. 15:9; Jonah 4:3). The ‘departure’ of the nephesh must be viewed as a figure of speech, for it does not continue to exist independently of the body, but dies with it (Num. 31:19; Judg. 16:30; Ezek. 13:19). No biblical text authorizes the statement that the ‘soul’ is separated from the body at the moment of death.”—The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible, edited by G.?Buttrick, 1962, Vol. 1, p. 802.To learn more go to <a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a> and download free What Does The Bible Really Teach,Read chapters 6 and 7 Where Are The Dead ? and Real Hope For your Loved Ones Who Have Died.Use this with the Bible.(1 Thessalonians 5:21) Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	I'm sorry for your loss. <br>  <br>  The Bible says that death brings immediate heaven or hell, depending only on whether the person believed in Jesus alone for salvation, or not.  <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

I lost my best friend this past summer, and he was only 16 as well. It's so confusing to us what God decides to do, but everything he does happens with his children (us) in mind. He loves us eternally and unconditionally. If you know your friend is in Heaven, you can ease your mind, because they are having a great time. There is no place more glorious to be after life than the Kingdom of God. Your friend was probobly a very strong person, but you have to think about the pain that they and their family was going through. It will be painful for so much longer, and it's not fair that the ones we love sometimes leave us. He will always watch over you and his other friends and family, but he is having a great time in heaven :) Only his body died, not his soul.

HZqi9XyJaa	They shouldn't.  Pork is still a filthy, unclean animal. <br>  <br>  The distinction of clean and unclean foods were originally made all the way back in the book of Genesis with Noah, before Jews. They were just repeated in Leviticus 11 and were just described in more detail. So these food laws were meant for everyone. And they were never changed.... <br>  <br>  Some people have thought it is now ok to eat because of mis-interpretation of scripture....<br>  <br>  The verse where it says not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man, but that which comes out of the mouth,this defiles a man has nothing to do with unclean foods, if people read the entire section in context the Pharisees were telling them they were defiled because they did not wash their hands before breaking bread.<br>  <br>  The verses in Acts where Peter see's a sheet come down showing unclean animals and saying they are clean isn't literal. If they read further it explains those verses, it actually says it wasn't talking about the animals literally, it was talking about the Gentiles (who were originally considered unclean). Once Stephen was stoned the Gospel was taken to the Gentiles. God was telling Peter that they are no longer to be considered unclean anymore. It refers to PEOPLE, not animals. The animals in the vision were just used as an example.<br>  <br>  The verse that says everything God has created is good, and no food is to 'be rejected, provided if is received with thanksgiving: the word of God and prayer make it holy.... By examining this passage in its overall context, Paul was countering a false teaching by saying that it is permissible to eat animal flesh as long as the meats were approved in the word of God. Paul was addressing the subject of enforced vegetarianism, not the subject of "unclean meats." <br>  <br>  Unclean animals are still unhealthy and shouldn't be eaten. God didn't change the animals and he didn't just change His mind about them.|`|MI53mUKzaa	Mark 7:14-15 (New International Version)<br>  <br>   14Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. 15Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him.

Although I must say that I have worked for companies before where I loved my managers and hated the owners so maybe it is  possible. But why try to make sense of it? I say that the best way to live is to find your own morals and standards. Christ taught about love, acceptance, charity, and many other things that I believe in. I don't, however, believe them BECAUSE Christ taught them. I believe then because I feel it is right. You should be your own moral compass.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

LOL!<br>  <br>  Now, YOUR question.  Let's see ... asked by someone who is clearly spiritually lost.  God is of three parts:<br>  <br>  1. God the Father<br>  2. Jesus (the son)<br>  3. The Holy spirit (that indwells us)<br>  <br>  Together those three parts are called "the trinity" or God is said to be a triune God.  EITHER way, we think of GOD as these three parts.  You'll hear Jesus described as God made man.  <br>  <br>  See ... GOD is almighty.  So, Jesus cannot be a SEPARATE God.  Then you would have two supposedly almighty Gods.  That is a logical impossibility.  So, Jesus is God.  Jesus is Lord.  Jesus is part of the trinity.  <br>  <br>  NOW ... you're trying to worship God the son and deny God the Father?  <br>  <br>  I hope you see that this is simply not possible.  Take God in all three parts or deny Him in all three parts.  Either/or.<br>  <br>  I would strongly encourage you to read the Bible and pray on this.

Jsqlkb3caa	Well...Of course as many others have said. God is supposed to love everyone in the world. BUT if you are a buddhist God will not love you enough to let you into heaven. According to the "Good Book" if you are not "saved" by Jesus then you will never go to heaven, but rather be tortured in hell for all time. So..sure, God loves Buddhists..so much so that even if that Buddhist did nothing but good things his/her whole life, he would watch then burn for all time. I don't know about you, but I could do without that kind of love.|`|yOK32PM9aa	He really loves them.

Clearly, seeking enlightenment without God does not work.Deuteronomy 18:9“When you are entered into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must not learn to do according to the detestable things of those nations. 10?There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, 11?or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead. 12?For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah.<br>  (1 Corinthians 10:14) Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.|`|xrajqHbgaa	How do you know what the correct path is?

A Common Mortal lives in a world of illusion, whilst a Buddha is Awake to the reality of that delusion. Buddha's sole desire is to enter the gateway that leads to our highest form of existence in human form. The way to the individual state of Enlightenment. God does not reside up in Heaven and the fires of Hell we do not find under ground, but rather can only be found in our own body. Both Heaven and Hell exist in our own  mind. The shadow of our mind is manifested from within the environment. When the body bends, so does the shadow. IOW those who are inflexible, will never be able to set themselves free.<br>  <br>  You speak of a correct path? Who are we to judge which path is right and which path is wrong. The universal language of Science which is Mathematics, actually confirms that all matter, biologically consists of the same building blocks. Evolution and Natural Selection provide the clear answer to the question, which came first, the chicken or the egg, through the Big Bang Theory.|`|l6LUNx9yaa	There is no right or wrong path. God has created many paths for the many groups of people. If you study various world religions, you'll find striking similarities if you can manage to see them from an analytical point of view. Nearly all religions are founded in some truth, and it seems like many of them were all given the same or nearly the same information and took it from there. People translate information in different ways. What one person takes one way, another person deciphers it in another.  Religions are simply the product of translation differences of the information that was provided. <br>  <br>  In Buddhism, they believe we all came from a source of light and energy, or the Deva.  This is a spirit of light in which all of our souls stem from, or at least that is the thought in Buddhism. <br>  <br>  In Christianity, man is in the image of God, mentally, spiritually, and physically. Even our souls are made in the image of God. Now, in the book of 1 John 1:5 it is recorded, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all."  What if this light is literal? There cannot be darkness in light, and light is energy. Interestingly enough, James 1:17 says, "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shaddow of change."  <br>  Hm...Father of lights. We are in his image, and God is light. In the Old Testament, Moses was permitted to see God as he passed and God was shining so bright that when he came off the mount, Moses's face was still glowing from it.  If we are in his image, we too are souls of light, as suggested in James 1:17. <br>  <br>  Buddhists teach one another of love, respect, and justness. Some of their teachings state: <br>  The greatest achievement is selflessness. <br>  The greatest worth is self-mastery. <br>  The greatest quality is seeking to serve others. <br>  The greatest precept is continual awareness. <br>  The greatest medicine is the emptiness of everything. <br>  The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways. <br>  The greatest magic is transmuting the passions. <br>  The greatest generosity is non-attachment. <br>  The greatest goodness is a peaceful mind. <br>  The greatest patience is humility. <br>  The greatest effort is not concerned with results. <br>  The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go. <br>  The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances." <br>  <br>  If we look at these, each and every one of these "Greatest" lessons are also spoken of throughout the Bible. <br>  <br>  Perhaps, religions don't differ all that much if we just look closer to see the similarities that we share and accept that the translations have become different. <br>  <br>  God is love. All beings are of his creation, and he loves them all. We should do so well to remember this and love our brothers and sisters of light as our Father would have us do.|`|sfkD5hR2aa	Do you mean "How does God feel about Buddhists?" or "Buddhists, how does God feel about them?"<br>  I'll answer the first question because I am not sure whom "them" is referring to in the second question.<br>  <br>  I don't Buddhism is the 'wrong' path, so I see no reason why God would dislike them. A path does not have to lead to or suggest belief in God to be correct. God should like anybody who has good moral values, and as far as I am concerned, you don't need to believe in God to have good moral values. And if God didn't like them, well, then he/she would not be a very nice God after all!<br>  Fortunately, God is not biased and does not judge people by their views relating to God.<br>  <br>  Quick Summary: You don't have to believe in God to be on the 'correct' path. As long as you lead your life without intentionally causing harm to others, you're good to go!<br>  So...God does not dislike Buddhists because of their religion. If they, however, commit thousands of murders and show no repent, I cannot blame God for disliking them, because I would too! **I am not saying God dislikes people who murder without a conscience...but nor am I saying he/she likes them either.<br>  <br>  **Everything above is my opinion. I am not saying it is factual.**<br>  <br>  <br>  Oops..I know I said "quick summary"..I didn't mean to ramble on and on..Sorry.|`|Fyc2nZ22aa	I believe that God loves everyone because he created everyone and he still loves us even though knows each and everything about each and every person.

MYIwyTpcaa	Positively, It allows them to identify, or disassociate themselves with their particular group. For example if the stereotype exists that all of "group a" wear pink hats, then if I want people to know I'm in "group a" then I will wear a pink hat, if I don't want people to know I'm in "group a" then I'll wear a black hat. Negatively, it paints a generality to a large group of people that may not be representative of the group itself, so that when I tell people I'm in "group a" they wonder why I'm not wearing a pink hat.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	It depends on the person.<br>  <br>  For instance, I'm black but the stereotype about black women having overly aggressive attitudes or being gold diggers or being quick to accept a welfare check, don't really affect me. Well, it doesn't make me feel bad anyway. None of those descriptions fit me but I do know some black women who do fit. I can't say that there aren't black women out here who will be a neck popping, pocket digging, welfare recipient. So, I can't get mad because someone points out the things that some people do. <br>  <br>  The way I see it, I don't represent all black people. I don't even represent most black people because people, regardless of what racial group, have differing mentalities within that group. But, I do know some people who use past condition to justify stereotypical behavior. I've overheard black guys talking where one told the other how he refused to get a job because he didn't trust white people and didn't want to work around them and I've overheard black people give their reasons for not looking for work to be because black people had been enslaved for X-amount of years so they earned the right to sit and chill, and shouldn't have to work. Although it is a stereotype that black people are lazy, hearing black folks say things like that, I can't argue and say it's not true. All I can say that all black people aren't  like that.|`|CvDzpQREaa	Depends on the stereotype. Negative stereotypes can be detrimental when it comes to deciding the faith of that group (such as in the case of deciding whether to let gay couples adopt children and marry).

I'm sure there are numerous tales of hauntings in Connecticut.

Not long after that this man allegedly stabbed his employer to death, and his attorneys built their defense around this incident.  Perhaps you could google "The Devil is his defense" murder case in Connecticut.  Word of WARNING:  DO NOT give any credence to the claims of so-called "ghost hunters" Ed and Lorraine Warren.  They were a nice old couple who seem to trust in their own wishful thinking but they've never been able to back up their claims of paranormal experiences, and they STILL defended their actions regarding the infamous "Amityville Horror" even after that whole ridiculous hoax was eventually revealed!<br>  Good Luck!

NOTc1b9saa	We are all spiritual beings within a temporary physical body..When we die only our physical overcoat returns to the Earth..Spiritual us continues living in the world of Spirit, from which we all come and to which we all return eventually..<br>  <br>  When we think OF someone, here or hereafter, we think TO them and they will be aware of our thought..<br>  <br>  When we pass to spirit after dying we express ourselves via our spiritual body which is much more sensitive than our physical, so because loved ones left on Earth will be thinking and feeling grief and pain, the loved one in spirit is often surrounded by a *blanket of Light* placed there by the Angels so as to prevent them being deeply hurt by the pain of their loved ones on Earth..<br>  <br>  That usually only last for a short time, a few days or a couple of weeks is normal, but from our point of view on Earth, when our thoughts cant get through to the loved one in spirit, it feels as though we cant even imagine them in our minds and can feel as though they have been erased..But then gradually we begin to reconnect again..<br>  <br>  So your loved one still needs your love..Send reassurance as well as it can be a great shock for them as well, although of course they have loving assistance available from relatives and Angels when needed..We dont suddenly *know everything* just because we passed over, and are very much the same person five minutes before we passed as we are five minutes after with the same beliefs, the same memories and same loves and the same hates!..Like on Earth, we choose to learn more as and when we are ready to do so..<br>  <br>  We are met with compassion and loving support, NOT judgement and condemnation which are the qualities of MAN, NOT of God..<br>  <br>  Email me if you feel the need to do so...Blessings..|`|O7w6XGqPaa	You are setting yourself up to be manipulated and bilked by pseudo psychics.

tdIuoIc1aa	to be in a relationship just to have a child of a particular race is pretty pathetic. children need to be brought into this world in a loving relationship. now that's not to say someone can't have a predisposition for a particular race.

It would be quiet unimaginable for a person who has integrity not to have a certain degree of faith. Integrity is not accomplished nor attained overnight. The person undergoes a process of purification and awakening of one's value and moral standard. It involves a life of self- discovery and discernment. The person undergoes this life-long process and gradually integrity grows and is nourished by life's experiences and the wisdom it has to offer subject to personal contemplation. <br>  <br>  Faith is borne out of the realization of one's principle and values attained in the process of life-long discernment. One cannot attain faith without discernment. In the spiritual plain faith is nourished and strengthened by God. The person feels being guided in faith. Thus, faith is accomplished in a two way process. A person's integrity aids him in his discernment of faith and a spiritual force gives him nourishment to attain faith once integrity is established.. Thus, integrity has a role to play in attaining faith. I would go for integrity.|`|lprYy9RGaa	The both link together.

vEEeq7kYaa	On the SLIM chance that this is a real question I give a lengthy explanation that may really help if you read it and the references.<br>  I believe in God, that is my faith at work. I accept the reality of evolution. Faith is not involved in that.<br>  The time frame that the planet, solar system and stars took to form in “creation” is not any part of evolutionary theory.  Cosmology is not Biology.<br>  Intelligent Design, Creationism, whatever euphemisms they wish to name the Genesis story of creation in attempt to interject religious dogma into public schools under the guise of science, simply does not work as science. This is why it has failed and shall continue to fail in any court to be considered an “alternative” to a scientific theory. Scientific Method is what determines if something is science or not. The theory of evolution is as true as germ theory, gravitational theory, and other theories of physics and math that enabled you to type your question here for display on the internet to people all over the world.<br>  I am a Registered Nurse.   The abysmal level of science literacy in this country is extremely disturbing to me. Ignorance CAN harm you when those who may not share your ethics use it in ways that may harm you or the environment.  On one level, genetic testing for many debilitating diseases can be life-saving and wonderful to help advance quality of life for millions, however, there are growing fears that it may be leading to insurance companies denying you coverage benefits! Genetic testing is just one of the things that have come about because of an APPLICATION of processes at work in evolutionary theory.<br>  Frankenfoods, (genetic engineering in our food supply) and cloning are also things have come about only through understanding of evolutionary theory. That is exactly what the discoverers of those processes attribute to their ability to achieve their predictions and make those new discoveries. <br>  We have also made great strides in discovering the causes and getting treatments for diseases through application of evolutionary theory. We would not even be concerned at all about a possible mutated bird flu pandemic if evolution did not happen.<br>  Please do not start the macro and micro evolution argument. Those terms only apply to time scale if used at all by biologists.  Enough *micro* changes over time and you end up with a population that cannot reproduce with the earlier form and then you have "macro"...a new species. Not all evolutionary changes lead to speciation. Most do not. Evolution also does NOT imply direction or advancement of any form. Some changes are beneficial for survival potential, others are benign (most in fact) and some lead to disadvantages in survival potential and lead to "evolutionary dead ends". <br>  Evolution is a cornerstone to understanding modern biology and medicine. It is imperative that anyone who plans to pursue any career in healthcare or biology understand a process that affects every living organism. As long as there is reproduction with exchange of genetic material, evolution happens. It doesn't require "believing in" but accepting the observed and tested reality. There has been absolutely NO debate in scientific circles over the reality of evolution for nearly 70 years. What IS debated in Biology are various means and methods and intricate details of the many processes at work IN evolution. We know more about how evolution works than we do about GRAVITY. This "debate" between fundamentalist literalists and the scientific and medical community is NO different from the early medieval church condemning astronomers who put forth the notions of a heliocentric solar system.<br>  Creationism and Intelligent Design are not science. The ideas at work cannot be applied to scientific method. They are not falsifiable, they make no predictions. This is why it fails in court EVERY time as an "alternative" view in a science curriculum. It is NOT science. Science is a method and not an entity. Scientific method does not address God belief, so it is only atheistic to the aspect that it does not address any faith in any deity one way or another. That is because we have no objective physical evidence to apply to the steps of scientific method to determine one way or another the reality of an Omnipotent Creator. Until that time, faith, belief, religion...are outside of scientific method.<br>  There is no belief, meaning faith, required for evolution to be accepted as real. <br>  Neither is it the case that evolution as a biologic theory, threatens or denies the existence of an Omnipotent Creator Deity. Scientific method does not apply to this issue because we have no objective data to put to the method to determine one way or another.<br>  Evolution isn't a threat to belief in an Omnipotent Creator. It is a threat to the SELF-CONCEPT held by people who accept certain religious beliefs that formed such a self-concept in their adherents. My faith in God is not threatened by scientific method.  My faith teaches me to test what I know to make sure it is real. If there is an aspect of dogma that I accept and it becomes threatened by objective evidence, perhaps that is an aspect of belief that should be challenged.<br>  Biology shows us that rather than life appearing on the planet *poof* in six literal days, as long as life exists, creation continues!<br>  Biology does not support or negate a God. <br>  The same Torah that the Genesis creation story came out of is the same Torah those fundamentalist literalists deny in their commandments! They will argue viciously for the creation story but just as harshly argue that the "Old" (eternal it says in the scripture) Testament has been "done away with" or "nailed to the cross". Religious dogma has no place in a science class.<br>  IMHO it is NOT faith in God that is *threatened* in the fundamentalist literalist, but their SELF-CONCEPT! I tested this over a number of years in chat rooms. ONLY VERY RARELY (and only after they heard my rationale) would any "Creationist" say YES to the following Yes or NO only simple question.<br>  Are you an animal?<br>  Most people will of course, say YES. Sometimes they will qualify it that our soul or spirit is different or that we have greater abilities, etc..but we are still animals. Almost all Creationists will give a knee jerk reaction that NO, we are human, we are above animals.<br>  When the very rare Creationist said "yes", it was ALWAYS with the qualifier that we are above and separate from all other animals. Well that wasn't the question..but at least they recognized they were animals.<br>  Our psyche is a wondrous thing. If our self-concept is threatened, the self-protective mechanism of DENIAL kicks in to prohibit the shattering of self to be replaced by one that is unacceptable to them. That EXPLAINS why they simply cannot see the literal mountains of observable, tested, verified, physical evidence that is SO VERY PLAIN to see to those whose self-concept is NOT threatened to KNOW that they too are an animal affected by the same biologic processes at work in all life. They are unable to consciously process things that would replace their self-concept with one that is degrading to them. So many of them are completely revolted by the notion that they are an animal. I do not see it as degrading. In fact, I can find spiritual wonderment and awe in knowing I am connected to all life on the planet. Nevertheless, that is just my own personal bent, that opinion has no bearing on the science involved to show me that connection.<br>  If you are indoctrinated to believe that humans are SEPARATE and ABOVE ALL other life and NOT connected to it..then THAT is why you cannot appear to grasp evolution (that is if you ever tried to learn what it is rather than what your preacher told you it was) Evolution shows that humans are all related, related to one another and to all life forms..we are bipedal primate mammals and we are still evolving as a species. That is a fact, not up for debate. <br>  Sometimes that self-protective mechanism is very helpful; in this instance, it impedes knowledge. There is NOTHING degrading about acceptance of our biologic mortal physical self. Our very thoughts are electro-chemical processes. I believe that an Omnipotent Creator set every process at work in the universe in place. That isn't my place in a science course to try to teach that, it makes no difference if one is atheist or theist in a science classroom; objective data is something that can be seen and tested by ALL. <br>  Scientific method is the best method yet devised by the human mind to determine if something is real or not. This is why theories change when new evidence comes into play. That is what makes it SCIENCE. Creationism/ID is religious dogma. It cannot be tested, it cannot be changed, and to do so is heresy. It is religion. <br>  Religion is belief in a deity with dogma and a method to seek to find meaning beyond our mere mortal life existence and find connection on a spiritual level and to fulfill purpose of existence. Science is a method, steps to discover knowledge of the universe. It primarily answers questions of why and how, not who. <br>  One may seek and find knowledge by using both in their life. I do and I understand their differences and their limitations to connect to one another. <br>  Homo sapiens has become Homo technos. We have lost something since we have gained technology. Our human ancestors once recognized our connections to all other life.|`|VncSMLMpaa	I do not think you can have a human being with the ability to live more or less three score years and ten (70) with all the complex processes going on 24 hours a day without a brilliant designer.<br>  <br>  Just think of the variety of beauty just of faces and eyes, that does not come about by some random chance.

Most Christians understand and accept this fact.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	No I do not believe that evolution is true.  I do not believe that Intelligent Design is true either.  <br>  <br>  I do understand that the theory of evolution is based on tested and verifiable facts.  That is the process of science.  To take a hypothesis, test that hypothesis to determine which facts can be demonstrated and reliably repeated.  Once this is done the facts are studied and a working theory of something like evolution is created.  That theory then undergoes rigorous examination and refinement until we have something like the current theory of evolution.  It does not require or need belief.  It is also not set in stone, and can continue to change as a better understanding of the facts behind the theory become known.<br>  <br>  On the other hand Intelligent Design is and will always remain a hypothesis used to disguise the religious belief of Creationism in a "Scientificy" coat.  I know this is the case because there are no testable, repeatable, and verifiable facts that show an intelligent supernatural being designed and created the universe.  There has been no scientific attemps to even propose how to test this hypothesis.  So it sits there lurking in the corner of the Christian mind as a argument against Evolutionary Theory, and not much else.  <br>  <br>  So all the "doesn't it make sense that" and "don't you think it's possible" sentences used to sell this product to the masses don't change the essential nature Intellegent Design.

Why would an entity such as a God create a being that could be killed in so many ways?  Why would he create other forms of life such as a virus that can kill his beloved creation by the 10's of millions?  Why would he place his creation on a planet that is so imperfect that it has earthquakes that kill hundreds of thousands of people at a time?  Is that all part of the "intelligent design" as well?

Therefore, it must have been created.<br>  <br>  This argument, also known as the argument from ignorance or "god of the gaps," is implicit in a very many different creationist arguments. In particular, it is behind all arguments against abiogenesis and any and all claims of intelligent design.<br>  <br>  Response:<br>  <br>     1. Really, the claim is "I can't conceive that (fill in the blank)." Others might be able to find a natural explanation; in many cases, they already have. Nobody knows everything, so it is unreasonable to conclude that something is impossible just because you do not know it. Even a noted antievolutionist acknowledges this point: "The peril of negative arguments is that they may rest on our lack of knowledge, rather than on positive results" (Behe 2003).<br>  <br>     2. The argument from incredulity creates a god of the gaps. Gods were responsible for lightning until we determined natural causes for lightning, for infectious diseases until we found bacteria and viruses, for mental illness until we found biochemical causes for them. God is confined only to those parts of the universe we do not know about, and that keeps shrinking.|`|fWWSWkIaaa	Pretty reasonable when you recognize that complexity and design are two completely distinct concepts.  Complexity can arise from nature in the form of very large amounts of distinct objects all interacting with each other in specific ways according to observed natural laws.  In this case it's the amount and order of the interactions and the amount of things interacting that make the system complex.  In your example it's not as complicated because there are fewer variables interacting, so obviously yes it is considerably less complicated than a human being which has many many more parts interacting in naturally complicated but essentially determined ways.  Not to mention that so many parts interacting leads to some parts interfering with other interactions and other parts amplifying other interactions which only increases the overall complexity of the system.<br>  <br>  Anyway this is how it's reasonable to believe that purely natural processes, with no designer, no intelligence and no plan eventually resulted in a human being.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I thought I should add that complexity doesn't refer to an actual property of anything, really, it refers to our inability to fully and immediately comprehend every aspect or consequence of every possible interaction or option in a given system.  The more there is to something the less we can immediately and completely understand every aspect of it and the more complex we consider it.|`|oReGA5kEaa	You gave an intelligent question so I'll try to respond in kind. <br>  <br>  I don't believe that all the questions have been answered or that it has been proven at least in the darwinian sense. If by evolution you mean that living organisms change and adapt over time, yes, I believe that does happens and can be proven. Where things become interesting is when we look at the origins of those organisms and try to determine how they came to exist. There are too many questions left in fields such as DNA, microbiology and astrophysics to definitively say that darwinian evolution exists or not. As you said, the complexity of organisms only seems to grow as our research delves deeper, which begs the question of intelligent design.

Those who believe in an older age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does not mention dinosaurs, because according to their paradigm, dinosaurs died out millions of years before the first man ever walked the earth. The men who wrote the Bible down couldn’t have seen dinosaurs alive.<br>  <br>  Those who believe in a younger age for the earth tend to agree that the Bible does mention dinosaurs though it never actually uses the word “dinosaur.” Instead, it uses the Hebrew word tanniyn (pronounced tan-neen; Strong’s #08577). Tanniyn is translated a few different ways in our English Bibles; sometimes it’s “sea monster,” sometimes it’s “serpent.” It is most commonly translated “dragon.” The tanniyn appear to have been some sort of giant reptile. These creatures are mentioned nearly thirty times in the Old Testament and are found both on land and in the water.<br>  <br>  In addition to mentioning these giant reptiles in general nearly thirty times throughout the Old Testament, the Bible describes a couple of creatures in such a way that some scholars believe the writers may have been describing dinosaurs. Behemoth is said to be the mightiest of all God’s creatures, a giant whose tail is likened to a cedar tree (Job 40:15ff). Some scholars have tried to identify Behemoth as either an elephant or a hippopotamus. Others point out that elephants and hippopotamuses have very thin tails, nothing comparable to a cedar tree. Dinosaurs like the Brachiosaurus and the Diplodocus on the hand other had huge tails which one could easily compare to a cedar tree.<br>  <br>  Nearly every ancient civilization has some sort of art depicting giant reptilian creatures. Petroglyphs, artifacts and even little clay figurines found in North America resemble modern depictions of dinosaurs. Rock carvings in South America depict men riding Diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of Triceratops-, Pterodactyl- and Tyrannosaurus Rex-like creatures. Roman mosaics, Mayan pottery and Babylonian city walls all testify to man’s trans-cultural, geographically-unbounded fascination with these creatures. Sober accounts like those of Marco Polo’s Il Milione mingle with fantastic tales of treasure-hoarding beasts. Modern day reports of sightings persist though they are usually treated with overwhelming skepticism.<br>  <br>  In addition to the substantial amount of anthropic and historical evidences for the coexistence of dinosaur and man, there are other physical evidences, like the fossilized footprints of humans and dinosaurs found together at places in North America and West-Central Asia.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Man's wisdom is foolishness to God|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Evolutionary science is junk science - purely agenda driven drivel<br>  <br>  1Ti 6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: <br>  <br>  <br>   1Ti 6:21 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

The part about the women who ate one of their sons is horrible too.  So, yes, it was offending, but not blaming anyone---it's just hard for me to read that stuff.<br>  <br>  It's good to know that God is on our side now, although we go through many things, but we will come out winners in the end.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Whenever I open the Bible or listen to Bill O'Reilly.|`|snj9zznvaa	no<br>  but other peoples interpretation  have
4yg7zZZ2aa	My religion [Judaism] is my religion.That's all.  I know it is man-made and flawed. There is no evidence that a deity brought fourth it. However I see benefit for it.  Being humanly crafted doesn't necessarily mean it is horrible. So I have room for it in a little bit of my life. Though it doesn't have great influence.<br>  <br>  For example when I keep kosher I feel connected to all past and present people who have and do keep kosher. It's a nice feeling, a tradition that I like. But as such it does not effect my emotional self. Frankly, if it did I'd be worried about my mental health.|`|dFBccLExaa	Neither, really. I feel more at peace when I'm practicing, but aside from that, not much. My religion doesn't make me love myself more, or anything of that sort. I'm cool enough that I can be okay with myself without my deities going "we love you" at every waking moment. <br>  So it brings me peace, gives me purpose, but doesn't make me really feel better or worse per say. <br>  I guess I should add that I'm Kemetic.|`|wwdllMzYaa	neither<br>  it just makes me feel like me<br>  <br>  i prefer to know things as they are, i dont have to agree with soemthing to accept it, which i am comfortable with,<br>  <br>  i admit being pagan atheist makes me feel a bit unique, as its not that many peopel that i come across who are similar to me in my beliefs, <br>  but not better or worse about myself, just me<br>  <br>  intresting q tho|`|24H5tznkaa	Definitely better about myself. A lot of the ritual work I did when I first got into the craft had to do with fear banishing...banishing past pains from childhood, forgiveness etc. So it directly made me feel better...I mean, I did most of the footwork and stuff but I applied what I learned to self heal. Learning to connect with nature healed me of chronic depression as well. <br>  <br>  Besides that, in all honesty, it has been a rather lonely life for me. I go through long periods of time in solitude and/or not fitting in with others...plus I have moved a lot. Those who I do connect with tend to put me on a pedestal and that keeps us from becoming truly close. If it wasn't for the richness of my connection with Divine beings and nature, I think that I would be very much dissatisfied with living in general.|`|HVM5aXa8aa	Sometimes I feel bad because I fail to live up to my high moral and ethical expectations. But part of living my religion is also letting go of unnecessary negativity, and when I fail, I do not dwell on it - instead I see it as an opportunity to be more conscientious of my actions, and put more effort into my high expectations. <br>  <br>  So when I live up to my expectations for myself, it makes me feel good. <br>  <br>  Also, my beliefs focus strongly on syncretism of all things that are positive experiences - there is no one way to live, worship or think, as long as it is a way that focusses on unity of oneself with one's environment in a positive manner. <br>  <br>  So when I live or worship "well", it brings a lot of positivity and makes me feel good.  I guess the only time I experience negativity in association with my religion is when I experience failure.|`|BWxSSADaaa	Well, it doesn't really effect how I feel about myself, but it certainly effects how I feel about life, or more specifically, death.  I'm an atheist, and I wish I believed or could believe that I would continue to exist after death.  But I don't believe in a heaven, or something like that.  So sometimes. when I think about it, I'm frightened and feel like it isn't fair.  But most of the time, I don't think about it.|`|2e8a9bfb5d022abc1ae72b43960c416caa	Better, because I know I'm loved unconditionally, and if I screw up, I can seek forgiveness.|`|gcdMCAfqaa	Better...in that the female divine is honoured as much as the male and that all people are accepted as they are regardless of religion, colour or gender.|`|e04eb452209dd3002d2d0fa18bdf5cd5aa	I must admit that I was motivated to become muslim when I discovered how much islam honors women.

Plus I didn't believe in Christ so I felt like a failure, too.<br>  <br>  Since I converted to Judaism, I feel better about myself, mankind and the world in general.|`|AA11923447	Both. In some ways better, and in some ways worse. I do love the sense of serenity and connection to the Divine that I get from my religion. I love many of its rituals and practices, and its emphasis upon charity and social justice. However, I grew up being told that I'm a filthy sinner and that Hell is ready to swallow me up at any moment. I was told stories about Hell when I was a toddler, and was told more of these stories in religious school, and I felt like a walking piece of garbage. I am currently having serious questions about my religion, and when I bring these questions up, I'm often warned about Hell all over again. I don't feel free to leave my religion sometimes because of a fear of being eternally tormented for doing so. In that way, my religion makes me feel seriously wretched.

LCAXc8S5aa	You completely misunderstand the nature of faith.<br>  <br>  Faith is based solely on the revelation of God that comes through the message of the Gospel - the Word of God that proclaims Him to be a God of love as evidenced in Jesus Christ, sent down from heaven, crucified for sinners, the Just One for the unjust, to reconcile us to God.<br>  Once the message is believed, from the heart, a restoration occurs wherein the believer is restored to a vital relationship with God, and becomes converted by the power of the Holy Spirit, spiritually joined to God, and destined for eternity in His Kingdom.<br>  <br>  "Are people so unhappy with their lives...?"<br>  What do you have, that you are not assured of losing?<br>  If you look at things from natural eyes, everything is frustration and futility, as Solomon points out in the Book of Ecclesiastes.

You are right that it makes no sense to believe something without any kind of proof.  It seems that most people don't really invent this sort of thing so much as they are influenced by parental and community teachings and belief systems which give a person some moral guidance and a sensation of comfort and security about life and death. It's a safe place for them. This does not really work for everyone though and more and more people are breaking away from the comfort of their religion because it no longer satisfies their inner need and questions about their life. Some of these people are terribly unhappy in this world because they have reached a realization that this is a world of triviality and nothing in it satisfies them. <br>  <br>   Those who have such an urgent all consuming question about the purpose of their life are the ones most likely to have a true inner awakening that influences them toward the method to attain spirituality where actual sensations show up in them revealing a benevolent giving force, call it what you will. By this they make the inner changes that equalizes them by the smallest degree to this benevolent giving force. There is proof of a larger reality based on bestowal and love but we can't feel it without making these inner adjustments and the best way to "make good use" our life is to reveal all of what is real by continuously expanding our inner senses while still in our body in this world. Questions like yours are good and to keep on digging and scrutinizing everything on the inside and outside will keep your questions developing more and more to the point in the heart that really makes a difference.

The paragraph continues,<br>  <br>      Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.

To assume that each body part evolved as a separate part from the rest of the body is ludicrous. <br>  <br>  When evolution skeptics want to attack Darwin's theory, they often point to the human eye. How could something so complex, they argue, have developed through random mutations and natural selection, even over millions of years?<br>  <br>  If evolution occurs through gradations, the critics say, how could it have created the separate parts of the eye -- the lens, the retina, the pupil, and so forth -- since none of these structures by themselves would make vision possible? In other words, what good is five percent of an eye?<br>  <br>  Darwin acknowledged from the start that the eye would be a difficult case for his new theory to explain. Difficult, but not impossible. Scientists have come up with scenarios through which the first eye-like structure, a light-sensitive pigmented spot on the skin, could have gone through changes and complexities to form the human eye, with its many parts and astounding abilities.<br>  <br>  Through natural selection, different types of eyes have emerged in evolutionary history -- and the human eye isn't even the best one, from some standpoints. Because blood vessels run across the surface of the retina instead of beneath it, it's easy for the vessels to proliferate or leak and impair vision. So, the evolution theorists say, the anti-evolution argument that life was created by an "intelligent designer" doesn't hold water: If God or some other omnipotent force was responsible for the human eye, it was something of a botched design.<br>  <br>  Biologists use the range of less complex light sensitive structures that exist in living species today to hypothesize the various evolutionary stages eyes may have gone through.|`|b87de1703c451a059831167ec8643e70aa	Your views of complexity, ''sophistication'' and perfection are completely subjective, not objective.

They always create the same things, and what they always create are always created by them. All these happen over and over again with no variation. We don't know how the universe was ultimately formed, but we know what it contains was not designed, so there is more of a reason to assume it wasn't designed than to assume it was. One day we may find an answered to that. The nebula form naturally, and they naturally form stars. The star's accretion forms the planets, and the order gets more and more complex as time goes on.

UK0HFbCyaa	To be honest, as my profile has been updated, I'm still Christian...but I feel more of a mediator type person between Christianity and other religions/explanations for Christian "flaws," whether it be in the religion or people<br>  <br>  First quote: The main purpose of this verse isn't to ignore yourself and be mindless in the Lord, but rather to trust God completely and to give recognition to his presence/urges/decisions and their authority over your own judgment. It also has a minor reference to the fact (recognized by non-Christians too) that your heart's desires can be deceitful, and in the long term be the death to yourself<br>  <br>  Second quote: I'm hoping that elaboration later in his speech/book (whatever form The Force of Faith is) or prior to that quote explains it better. If not...I disagree. Another possibility is that he got caught up with the accusations of Christianity/religion be illogical in nearly every aspect, and threw that statement out there out of anger, frustration, or some other overwhelming emotion. Anyway....regardless of his intent, I guess if his quote was to be assumed true....he didn't mean in ALL and EVERY aspect of religion is not led by logic or good sense, but merely that faith is usually a different kind of sense; it's an unexplainable drive of something greater than what is on this Earth<br>  <br>  Third quote: I think Martin wasn't referencing to reason specifically as much as people who manipulate reason into a weapon against religion. He might also be referring to the many doubts of believers by thinking through things logically, but there are many types of logic, depending on how someone was brought up, in addition to his or her own perception of things<br>  <br>  Christianity is anti-intellectual because:<br>  - The people who try to represent Christianity fail<br>      > Those people are called hypocrites, sometimes leading to generalizing<br>      > As humans were expected to follow and trust a god whose many ideas and concepts and circumstances are "beyond our understanding"<br>  <br>  Christianity is intellectual because:<br>  - Depending on your viewpoint and education, science points toward the evidence of the existence of a god (read Lee Strobel's The Case for a Creator....I haven't finished yet)<br>  - Depending on your viewpoint, it's obvious that there's a creator because humans seem to specifically be the only animals capable of high level thinking and thought.<br>  - Though much of the Bible might not make sense or seems ridiculous, many of its lessons are applicable to even a secular world- be kind, generous, don't be judgmental in a hypocritical fashion, etc<br>  <br>  Even if it is straight out a false religion, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I know plenty of people who go to church simply for a social life. Churches also help with mission trips (though many might not agree with the purpose of mission trips, missionaries also help communities build/rebuild structures, offer various supplies/materials, as well as some fun activities for the children in the area. And unlike much accusation, most mission trips nowadays are not FORCED. Force these days would require military force, and I haven't heard of Christians picking up guns and going to Honduras or something).<br>  <br>  In addition to that, pastors and youth group leaders authorize fun events (regardless of religious purposes) and offer additional people to go to for life problems.<br>  <br>  My Korean church I attend has a lot of neighboring Korean churches in a wide area, so sport events are also held, such as KC tournament (basketball), turkey bowl (football), and though there aren't enough people for my church to participate, volleyball is also held<br>  <br>  Church is not only about religious dignity- it is also about a human community<br>  <br>  Also, addressing God himself, real or not, many people make it through life because of God. I myself did not go suicide because of God...and again, real or not, God helps people. I'm not disregarding historic events where God really DIDN'T help people (i.e. crusades), but in the present, I don't really hear much about God driven wars or massacres and such (I'm sure there's some minor fighting between societes, but nothing HUGE).<br>  <br>  As always, I apologize for any typos that midlead the intent of a sentence/paragraph (when writing long answers), and please correct me if I'm wrong about little religious fighting in the world|`|8pQrIL90aa	Intellect is applicable in certain areas of life.

And somewhat less nefarious anti-intellectual streaks can still be found in intelligent design pseudoscience and Falwell's "moral majority" movement (he characterized public education as satanic and proposed Christian theocracy in schools as the solution). <br>  <br>  Still, I have to give Christians credit for improving and reforming their religion over the centuries. Many Christians favor freedom of religion, gender equality, and individual rights irrespective of the faith of its citizens. They've gone from execution and torture of suspected "witches" in the 14th century, Savornarola's "Bonfire of the Vanities" in the 16th century - to a philosophy that mostly respects freedom of speech and does not kill anyone who converts out of Christianity. If only Islam could do the same...<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: hmm, on second thought maybe Christianity is more anti-intellectual than I suspected. Attributing human failures to convenient "demons" (see got soul above), relying on pseudoscience by excluding empirical analysis, compartmentalizing reason to convenient everyday affairs - these things are profoundly anti-intellectual, and I'm not trying to sound snobby by saying so.|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	At first thought and as an agnostic, I would say that Christians are generally anti-intellectual.  As a rule, Christians are not encouraged to seek truths beyond what they are taught or what is directed by the Bible as you've cited in question.  I think that such anti-intellectualism is practiced predominantly by fundamentalist Christians.  Conversely however, the Jesuits have a reputation for being quite intellectual.  There are those who are Christian from fear, and that fear will prevent them from questioning dogma.  As a child I attended a liberal Protestant denomination -- for which I am grateful; in high school we had a Sunday School teacher who worked for NASA and who encouraged us to question our religion; in result, I became agnostic, although I can recall mentally questioning the existence god at a much younger age.  Christians will be anti-intellectual, in my opinion, if they are content to be "sheep" and to follow the Bible literally.

Faith is actually a pre requisite for reason. <br>  You prove it in your question. When you speak about reason you have assumed that there is a universal standard of logic that everyone adheres to. If there is no God you have no basis on which to make that assumption. If there is no God then you are an accident - Your brain is also an accident and there is no reason to believe that your thinking is any more than chemicals and synapses firing randomly in your brain. You can't even know that you are thinking the right thoughts?<br>  So to speak of reason you have to assume differently - and you HAVE assumed differently - BY FAITH. But only a Biblical worldview gives you a REASON for REASON. Yours is merely a Blind Faith.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Atheism takes the greatest faith of all.<br>  <br>  The bible says God is light.<br>  Light is energy . <br>  In 1905, Albert Einstein formulated E=MC2 which says that energy has always existed, either as mass or energy. <br>  So God being Energy, has always existed and was never created, because energy always has existed and always will exist.|`|nI1N3pxqaa	The greatest intelligence is the intelligence of God.<br>  Read the first 10 chapters of the Book of Proverbs.<br>  Intelligence is one thing, wisdom is far greater.<br>  <br>  Truth is narrow, not wide.|`|PwD3slrTaa	You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your mind and all your soul and all your strength.<br>  <br>  It's ridiculous to call this anti-intellectual, as the scriptures hold up against scrutiny far past any other ideology; they always have.|`|VR7JfxM4aa	Some branches of Christianity are fiercely anti-intellectual.<br>  Some are mildly so.<br>  Some are not anti-intellectual at all.|`|iHDYncuXaa	No, but your question is.|`|Mt85amuCaa	nope!<br>  <br>  just believing that we are the chossen one... and the rest is not...<br>  <br>  so then, we know things others would not be able to know for they do not believe in HIM...|`|oVHFz52Laa	No. Of course some people can say that, but that does not make it true|`|mo4MnsX7aa	Christianity has never been anti-intellectual.  Being anti-intellectual would be to reject that which you cannot sense simply because you cannot sense it.  Anti-intellectual would be to try to use natural means to explain that which is supernatural.  Proverbs tells us that our own understanding is insufficient and often misleading.  Copeland (with whom I do not necessarily agree) seems to be suggesting that logic will never explain God.  Luther restates the misleading nature of our own understanding referred to in Proverbs.  <br>  <br>  Christianity might be seen as anti-intellectual by those who have nothing other than natural means.  Fortunately, we have more than that.|`|ylaGS5EHaa	Well I can certainly understand why you think that from the quotes and the actions of those that claim to be Christian on this forum. I will answer as I may. <br>  <br>  Faith is only based off of personal experience, feelings etc. the problem with that is it is impossible to reason with. For instance remember the story of A Christmas Carol. Scrooge had a personal experience with his old business partner, Marley, he was quickly able to explain it away as a tricking of the senses by any little thing mainly because that is what he wanted to believe, that was what he valued. It was not until later when he decided to trust these visions that he was able to change. God does not want to overwhelm us into belief, and if it were logical or even reasonable to do so it would harm that process. He gives us enough for ourselves, enough to be a willing follower and works with us from there. <br>  <br>  The other real problem with logic and reason is that they so often fail with our limited human understanding, for instance:<br>  <br>  No cat has nine tails.<br>  I have no cat.<br>  Ergo my cat has nine tails.<br>  <br>  Both of the first statements maybe true but the conclusion is wrong. People have been fighting over what is reasonable and logical for millenia, differences of values and definiton of what is reasonable have caused wars (Civil war for instance) so they should not be relied on for absolute truth, truth about God. For that we need to rely on Him because He has all truth and understanding. For instance, one I see on here a lot:<br>  <br>  God is supposed to be all powerful and all good<br>  An all powerful and all good being would stop evil from happening<br>  Evil happens<br>  Ergo, God must either be not all powerful, not all good,or not there.<br>  <br>  You see the second line is a value judgement, something that people think is reasonable esp. when they believe that this world is the only place to obtain justice or that all suffering is bad. God has a different answer for that, one that we can only know if we rely on Him. Hope this answers it for you.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Great scientists like Johannes KEPLER saw God's magnificance and constantly gave praise to God Almighty for his wonderful laws built into nature.

Please get an education|`|AA11923447	Not necessarily. My own denomination has a rather long intellectual tradition, as well as a very strong emphasis upon education (both religious and secular). I grew up attending Christian schools, and we were constantly urged to learn as much as humanly possible about secular philosophy, science, mathematics, the arts, literature and other fields. Our schools have a reputation for academic excellence, and many of our clergy members hold doctoral degrees in secular fields. Nothing is gained from ignorance and anti-intellectualism.

WalnRzfGaa	Christians should not Hate anyone, since they are not supposed to judge others.|`|b77af9f788ecbbd1984a5e2166b0d0ceaa	Sinner and sin are two different things.  Sinners have no choice because they all inherited this sin from the first man Adam so they all called sinners.  "That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned—." (Rom 5:12)   But if certain sinner knows sin (doing vile thing) is bad, he continues to practice it due to him being short of God's glory (being sinner).  We hate the sinful or vile things that he practiced not him the sinner.<br>  <br>  Christianity is not a sin but Christians being sinners do sinful things to portray Christianity to look really bad as a religion.  Don't hate Christianity, Christians (sinners), or everyone else (sinners), hate the sinful things that sinner promotes that aren't harmony with the righteousness of God's upright standards.  I meant the righteous standards of the only one true God and Creator, not the righteous standards of made up god or gods (like Satan and his demons).<br>  <br>  If the made up gods' righteous standards are the same as the only one true God's upright standards, then there shouldn't be any wars, crimes, sufferings, etc. in this world. Is there?|`|U51pBeLfaa	It depends on how you define Christianity.

We don't like our own actions sometimes, but it's because we're imperfect humans.  We recognize that everyone is in the same boat on that one.  <br>  <br>  Let me compare it loving your child.  You don't like it when your child misbehaves, but you still love the child.  No amount of bad behavior from your child will cause you to stop loving them, right?  <br>  <br>  I hope that clears things up a little.|`|AA10051358	I understand where you are coming from.

During this time we removed all food from our diet...but we maintained water consumption.<br>  <br>  The point of a fast is to remove those things in your life that take your focus on Christ.  So...you can fast from food...you can fast from TV...you can fast from your cell phone.  The point is to remove that which is not needed in order to have clarity.<br>  <br>  So, my suggestion?  Your heart will tell you what you need to remove from your life.  Once that is figured out (and committed to) then figure out your time line.  24 hours?  48 hours?  next 39 days leading up to Easter?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good luck, and may God continue to shine on you.<br>  -Shalom|`|f1ycXGuHaa	i fasted for thirty hours, it's not that hard.  drink a lot of sugary beverages, don't take a dump, and keep busy.

In virtue of which no fact can be real or no statement true unless it has sufficient reason why it should not be otherwise.<br>  <br>  Why do you folks who have never taken a logic course ASSUME that an argument with a religious subject is using a different form of logic than everything else. <br>  <br>  I don't get it. LOGIC DEALS WITH THE FORM OF AN ARGUMENT NOT ITS SUBJECT MATTER.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	It's not a tautology, since from a scientific standpoint, it's clear that in nature, absolutely everything forms without a designer.  If a Christian believes even a tiny little bit of science, he's likely to believe that at least some things form without a designer.

uXxdxK7jaa	I don't really know what you are asking... but I'll try.  As you know- the gospels were written by 4 different men.  All of them had different professions, walks of life (prior to Christ), and even natural interest bends. <br>  Matthew was a tax collector.<br>  His gospel focused more on the prophetic word in the Old Test. and Christ fullment in the New Test. - He spoke primarily to the jews who were more familiar with the prophecies<br>  Mark was alot younger than the others. Believed to be a teen when Jesus was in Jerusalem- His mother was a close follower of Jesus (Acts12:12)He focused on Jesus as the Suffering servant<br>  Luke was a doctor- He actually didn't even know Christs personality- as he became a follower after Christs death.  Paul taught him the gospel. His focus was on the miracles that took place in Jesus' ministry- he paid special attention to the healings that took place.<br>  John served as an apostle. He focused on Jesus' diety as the son of God. His book was written last- meaning he probably read the other three- It seems he chose to write about the things that others did not. <br>  <br>  Each book is different because each man is different- but each book was inspired by the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Now with the Paul's Epistles... He wrote them all. <br>  <br>  Here's a book that might help with his epistels..."The Epistles to the Colossians, to Philemon, and to the Ephesians" by f.f bruce.<br>  The bit I gave you about the Gospels can be found by research on line- try tools on Crosswalk.com.<br>  <br>  Blessings!<br>  j|`|3PiIh7Qiaa	the bible has been taken apart and is missing pieces because it has been translated through 8 different languages and you can never fully translate anything words are always lost<br>  then there is the vatican they edited the bible to keep people in line witch really didn't work especially after the dead sea scrolls were found with only 2 of them to be studied and translated the others were put in to the vatican vault <br>  as far a paul is concerned each branch of Christianity(baptist, catholics, Presbyterian, etc..) all have a slightly different version of it all so check out other bibles (older ones probably) you might get somewhere then <br>  or ask your priest/pastor|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Almost half of "Paul's Epistles" were written long after Paul died.<br>  <br>  Oops.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	.<br>  Nothing has been added or subtracted from the King James Bible,<br>  <br>  It is the MOST accurate English Bible we have.<br>  <br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|4sUek7ugaa	Because Paul's epistles were the basis for Christian doctrine, silly.

gmaCvh00aa	As the Catholic church developed, the Bishop of Rome became the most important Bishop, now called the Pope, probably because Rome was the center of their civilization.  One of the Popes decreed that priests should not marry, using Paul's exhortation that it's best not to marry as the reason, but more practically it was to keep the church from losing property through marriage laws.  There are many Catholics who disagree with this, and there are some priests who are secretly married and there always have been.<br>  <br>  Abstaining from eating meat on Lenten Fridays isn't a "doctrine", it's just a practice from the old days when Lent was the time that new converts prepared to be baptized at Easter Vigil and so fasted or sacrificed something to commemorate Christ's 40 days in the Wilderness.  Until a few hundred years ago, it was stricter--no meat, no fat of any kind, including butter or dairy products.  <br>  <br>  Similary, the Novena, a nine-day set of prayers, follow the nine days between Ascension and Pentacost when the original Apostles were praying constantly.<br>  <br>  However, if you are truly "just curious", stop using the "it's not in the bible" argument, which negates your supposed simple curiosity.  The Catholic Church believes in a living church that grows and changes and doesn't use JUST the bible as more recently-formed churches do, but also relies on oral teachings and traditions from the early church.  Remember, for most of the church's existence, the majority of people could not read!  Why would the Bible have ever been the be-all and end-all of Christian teaching?|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	For some one who is not attacking your doing a good job of it. The priest and Bishops were not always Celibate and do to some unscrupulous Clergy including a Pope or two the Church made Celibacy a requirement to the Priesthood. Lent is a act of penance and sacrifice beginning with the imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday to show our penance. Your a typical Fundamentalist and they can not help them selves in there Attacking the Body of Christ the Catholic Church.. I'll not go into any debate with your assumptions and beliefs and even tho you i'm certain do not know there was no new testament until the 4th century and you only have it now because of the Catholic Church but any way explain this bible verse from Revelation chap20 verse12......|`|AA11598520	1) In 1 Corinthians, for example, Paul actually seems to prefer the celibate life: "Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage... Those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that... The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord; but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife, and his interests are divided" (7:27-34). This is not to say that all men should be celibate, however; Paul explains that celibacy is a calling for some and not for others by saying, "Each has his own special gift from God, one of one kind and one of another" (7:7).<br>  <br>  Jesus Himself speaks of celibacy in Matthew 19:11-12: "Not all can accept this word, but only those to whom it is granted. Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of God. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it." Again, the emphasis is on the special nature of celibacy, one for which not all men are suited, but one that nevertheless gives glory to "the kingdom of God."<br>  <br>  Perhaps the best evidence for the scriptural support of celibacy is that Jesus Himself practiced it!<br>  <br>  I don't happen to agree, however, that celibate priests are necessary any long. I think it should be a choice. (See how we Catholic can and do think for ourselves?)<br>  <br>  2)The abstinence from fleshmeat is an ecclesiastical law with<br>  associations to Divine Positive Law, as expressed, for example, in St. Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians (9:25) and Second Epistle to the Corinthians (6:5).  Abstinence promotes our spiritual health by<br>  enabling us to subdue our flesh (1 Corinthians 9:27). Where, by the way, in the bible are we commanded to eat meat, particularly on Fridays during Lent? I've never seen that one. Does that mean that vegetarians and vegans are going to hell? Sounds rather silly, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  At one point you claim not to be attacking anyone and not long after that you claim that the Church is being influenced by demons. Little bit of a contradiction there, wouldn't you say?|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	while you claim to not be "attacking" that is sadly what this sounds like.  if you would like you are more than welcome to ready the thousands of posts to these same questions.  if you are not a male in the catholic church wanting to be a priest you really don't have to worry. if you are not a catholic celebrating lent - you don't have to worry either.<br>  <br>  we abstain by choice - just as we just to be catholic by choice.  i have no problem giving up what was considered a luxury while i'm honouring my Lord & Risen Saviour during this lenten commemoration of the 40 days HE spent fasting!<br>  as for the celibacy -- they are not to MARRY there is a big difference.  they make the CHOICE to become a priest knowing full well the ramifications.  to be able to marry and have the same duties would be very challenging.  while there are married priests - they are those that were married prior and "preachers, pastors, et al" in a different denomination that convert.<br>  <br>  EDIT -- you DO realize there is  a LOT more to the bible that just one little passage right?!  that there are numerous times when the bible talks of being celibate as well. that the bible talks of fasting.....  read the whole thing in context and then try again.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	It is only your own particular faith tradition that prevents you from recognizing the true context and application of the things you cite.<br>  <br>  Quit taking Bible passages out of context and then you might begin to see the truth.<br>  <br>   FYI ... sacraments are not works. They are the primary channels of God's grace ... the Church being the universal sacrament of salvation for all.|`|MiAOnwN6aa	You are asking too many questions expecting simple answers. Firstly, "doctrines" is an incorrect word for most of these practices. Generally, the authority comes from Matt. 16: 18-19. Celibacy & abstinence from meats are disciplines decided by authority as one of the ways of practicing penance as commanded by scripture; especially, as found in Chap II in the Apocalypse. The Church teaches that ALL things are good and that by giving up some good things we might learn how to give up sinful things that present themselves as good. Scripture does not expressly forbid the practice of penance; especially, since these practices are not universally applicable to all at all times & can be changed when deemed appropriate.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  The church argues that Christ gave the men running his church some leeway as well as authority to make rules and regulations.<br>  <br>  In the economy of the New Testament, the Lord wanted the Church to be a universal sacrament of salvation. The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council teaches that "the Church, in Christ, is in the nature of sacrament—a sign and instrument, that is, of communion with God" (Lumen gentium, n. 1). It is God's will that the forgiveness of sins and the return to divine friendship should be mediated by the Church's action: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Mt 16:19), Jesus solemnly said to Simon Peter, and in him to the Supreme Pontiffs, his successors. He also entrusted the same task to his Apostles and, in them, to the Bishops, their successors: "Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Mt 18:18). On the evening of the very day of the Resurrection, Jesus would make this power effective by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit: "If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (Jn 20:23). Because of this mandate, the Apostles and their successors in priestly charity would henceforth be able to say with humility and truth: "I absolve you from your sins"... <br>  <br>  These verses above would also include the ability to make the few regulations you mention.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|WNWKDw4uaa	From Jesus Christ.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Some clarifications and then the answer proper.<br>  <br>  None of what you cite are doctrines. They are disciplinary rulings. Hugely different. It was misunderstandings like that that caused the split-up of Christianity. IF your Dad says, Eat your vegeatables, then you should. You do not have to agree with him that 'Spinach is yummy'.<br>  <br>  I read on and see that you put 'doctrines' in quotes and then equate it with the word in 1 Timothy 4 -- that is lousy. You would get the whistle in a rhetoric or debate competition. <br>  <br>  They are not commanded against in the Bible. <br>  <br>  1) You only become a priest if you accept the celibacy. You aren't dragooned into the priesthood against your will and then made to be celibate !!<br>  <br>  2) The Church's Lenten regulations are Her trying to impose a minimum of the 'deny yourself' that Jesus commanded. <br>  <br>  But most of all if one didn't think that Jesus Himself had set up the Church as the guardian of His Teaching on Faith and Morals, one simply wouldn't be a Catholic. This is not Islam. You aren't murdered for not believing. <br>  <br>  ALso, there are many married priests in the Catholic Church, they just belong to other rites than the Roman. And anyone can change rite.<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlitur97.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/library/Liturgy/zlit...</a>

It does not say don't add a Revelations 22:22 either. <br>  <br>  It says - don't add to the end time PROPHESIES in the book. LDS have added many end time prophesies to Revelations.

For this end, we must be knit together, in this work, as one man. We must entertain each other in brotherly affection. We must be willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities, for the supply of others’ necessities. We must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality. We must delight in each other; make others’ conditions our own; rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and community in the work, as members of the same body. So shall we keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. The Lord will be our God, and delight to dwell among us, as His own people, and will command a blessing upon us in all our ways, so that we shall see much more of His wisdom, power, goodness and truth, than formerly we have been acquainted with. We shall find that the God of Israel is among us, when ten of us shall be able to resist a thousand of our enemies; when He shall make us a praise and glory that men shall say of succeeding plantations, "may the Lord make it like that of New England." For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause Him to withdraw His present help from us, we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world. We shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of God, and all professors for God's sake. We shall shame the faces of many of God's worthy servants, and cause their prayers to be turned into curses upon us till we be consumed out of the good land whither we are going. And to shut this discourse with that exhortation of Moses, that faithful servant of the Lord, in his last farewell to Israel, Deut. 30. "Beloved, there is now set before us life and death, good and evil," in that we are commanded this day to love the Lord our God, and to love one another, to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his ordinance and his laws, and the articles of our Covenant with Him, that we may live and be multiplied, and that the Lord our God may bless us in the land whither we go to possess it. But if our hearts shall turn away, so that we will not obey, but shall be seduced, and worship other Gods, our pleasure and profits, and serve them; it is propounded unto us this day, we shall surely perish out of the good land whither we pass over this vast sea to possess it. Therefore let us choose life,that we and our seed may live, by obeying His voice and cleaving to Him, for He is our life and our prosperity." ~ John Winthrop

Really though I haven't changed much from the pamphlet. For me Salat is as good as I make it, if I focus and have been reflecting on Allah (SWT) before the salat then it is amazing, if I stop in the middle of a movie to pray or something like that, then it's not as good due to my lack of focus and of preparing myself to communicate with my Rabb|`|CWetEqx6aa	My taught me how to.

FXeuwkX0aa	Yes they do:<br>  <br>  Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. <br>  <br>  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. <br>  There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. <br>  There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. <br>  <br>  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. <br>  The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br>  <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	No<br>  <br>  Animals don't have souls|`|D9lMg7A2aa	They have animal souls.

The soul is what animates us, what makes us who we are.  In that sense,nonhuman animals indeed have souls.  My cat has a distinct personality, and if you've hung around dogs enough, you'll know that they have personalities as well.  In that sense, yes, all animals have souls.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the afterlife for humans or other animals.

In my opinion, everything has a soul, including animals. We don't really know what goes on in their minds, just like how you don't know what I think about.<br>  I also believe that even objects can have a small part of a soul. To me, when you develop a sentimental value to an object.<br>  For example, I love music, and pianos and instruments mean a lot to me. I don't have a piano at home, so I have to practise at school at the same broken piano each day, and I hear people talking about having grand pianos at home they don't use. I don't get upset or jealous, I've developed a sort-of sentimental value with the broken piano, because even if it's broken, and I'm the only person who has used it in about 20 years, and it feels like it's a part of me, or at least the music is. When you give your all in everything, you give it a little of your soul, then it gives a little of it's soul back to you, and you excel at what you are doing and develop a special relationship with it and a sentimental value.<br>  If you have a dog you love and you've spent time with them and developed a relationship, then you've given that dog a little of your soul, and that dog has given you a little of their own.<br>  At least, that's what I believe. I think it's quite nice.|`|oFRTjasVaa	I personally don't think it's far to say that humans are the only animals with souls.<br>  Yes i do think they have souls if anything can be that affectionate then it has to have one.|`|XLBwRZjDaa	lol very good question. we think were better because we think were better. don't think. yet again its something we as humans are incapable of. when i die i wnat whatever happens to animals to happen to me.|`|b4Y0gYlIaa	no they do not have souls. but the prophet said if you loved that dog or cat enough, whatever you had, they'll be in heaven.|`|qEIURrnJaa	Yes and Yes.|`|8D9pAEAbaa	The one in my alley does.|`|aGynBPbCaa	dogs dont wear shoes...|`|r4cThgwdaa	sure they do. they go to puppy hell. and burn and burn|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	no

r8rykCkGaa	He was talking to the Pharisees who were the religious rulers / hypocrites of his day.  This applies to many in border-line "Christian" religions today and false religions.  They put heavy burdens on their followers but they have big sins themselves.  It could apply to some extent any Christian who is more religious than spiritual.  A "religious spirit" is an evil spirit and it causes confusion and oppression.<br>  <br>  Yeah, and they honor God with their lips but their hearts are far from it.  We must have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.|`|PwD3slrTaa	Jesus was talking about the temple ministers who were evidently greedy and abusive to their vulnerable, tender orphans and widows by squeezing them for money.  (Cf. widow's mite.

There was a concept called Corban, it allowed you to set aside money, property, etc to donate to the temple, keeping it from taxes and any other obligation. The problem was that there was no time frame set for the donation, it could come after death even, hence a person could withhold money to support their parents calling it corban, but never actually donate it to the temple until they were dead, dishonoring their mother and father. The point is that they were looking for loopholes in the commandments for their own personal pleasure, drawing near to God just giving lip service while focused only on themselves.|`|nQvcqVkNaa	Jesus was speaking to the religious leaders of his day. As with everything in the Bible, there is a minor fulfillment and a major fulfillment. Everything occurs twice in the Bible. The injection of paganism into the realm of "christianity" in 325 C.E. makes all those pagan rituals that God hates into modern traditions that the religious leaders of today continue to promote. Any religion that practices rituals and holidays of pagan origin are just as guilty as those religious leaders in Jesus' day in that they "nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition"|`|d6Tibhz6aa	The talmud.<br>  A collection of Jewish extra biblical writings, obswerved by the jews as scripture.

A-DURRRRR|`|ibHK60E5aa	This is a controversy that Jesus is telling his position 1). toward  rabbinical traditions about the law: 2).towards the Law its self. In these verse he is talking to the Pharisees. In it he admits, the binding character of the Law itself, but denied the authority of rabbinical tradition and that on tow grounds, 1( That it has no divine authority. 2).that instead of forming a hedge around the Law, and assisting its observance, as it possessed to do, it really abrogated it, by affording pretexts for its invasion. So he is talking the Pharisees There are numerous churches in that condition today. But remember we are not under the law. Jesus fulfilled the Law on the cross. If a Church does not take the whole Bible rightly divide and the New Testament as your rule of faith. Then he is talking to that church. I personally don't use no other Bible but the King James Verses|`|jdRKZe18aa	I believe He was referring to those who were still claiming to follow the jewish 'law' but were hypocrits!|`|xo4iux9gaa	Pharisees = modern day atheist wana bees.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	He was referring to people like you. No doubt about it :<br>  <br>  2 Peter 3:16<br>    Some things in the Bible are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, leading to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures.|`|aZUszuqLaa	Pretty much all organized religion.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	The Pharisees of course<br>  <br>  Second part - many of them|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Additions to God’s laws reflect upon his wisdom, as if he had left out something which was needed, and which man could supply; in one way or other they always lead men to disobey God. How thankful ought we to be for the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion of the Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine or practice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions of their own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear, that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent’s wants called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to the temple all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, and therefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was making the command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in a little compass; "In vain do they worship me." It will neither please God, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will be their recompence.

(Nu 21:1-3, 34,?35; Jos 6:20,?21; 8:21-27; 10:26-40; 11:10-14) This fact has been used by some critics as a means for depicting the Hebrew Scriptures, or “Old Testament,” as imbued with a spirit of cruelty and wanton slaughter. The issue involved, however, is clearly that of whether God’s sovereignty over the earth and its inhabitants is acknowledged or not. He had deeded over the right of tenure of the land of Canaan to the ‘seed of Abraham,’ doing so by an oath-bound covenant. (Ge 12:5-7; 15:17-21; compare De 32:8; Ac 17:26.) But more than a mere eviction or dispossessing of the existing tenants of that land was purposed by God. His right to act as “Judge of all the earth” (Ge 18:25) and to decree the sentence of capital punishment upon those found meriting it, as well as his right to implement and enforce the execution of such decree, was also involved.<br>  <br>  The justness of God’s prophetic curse on Canaan found full confirmation in the conditions that had developed in Canaan by the time of the Israelite conquest. Jehovah had allowed 400 years from Abraham’s time for the ‘error of the Amorites to come to completion.’ (Ge 15:16) The fact that Esau’s Hittite wives were “a source of bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah” to the extent that Rebekah had ‘come to abhor her life because of them’ is certainly an indication of the badness already manifest among the Canaanites. (Ge 26:34,?35; 27:46) During the centuries that followed, the land of Canaan became saturated with detestable practices of idolatry, immorality, and bloodshed. The Canaanite religion was extraordinarily base and degraded, their “sacred poles” evidently being phallic symbols, and many of the rites at their “high places” involving gross sexual excesses and depravity. (Ex 23:24; 34:12,?13; Nu 33:52; De 7:5) Incest, sodomy, and bestiality were part of ‘the way of the land of Canaan’ that made the land unclean and for which error it was due to “vomit its inhabitants out.” (Le 18:2-25) Magic, spellbinding, spiritism, and sacrifice of their children by fire were also among the Canaanites’ detestable practices.—De 18:9-12.<br>  <br>  Baal was the most prominent of the deities worshiped by the Canaanites. (Jg 2:12,?13; compare Jg 6:25-32; 1Ki 16:30-32.) The Canaanite goddesses Ashtoreth (Jg 2:13; 10:6; 1Sa 7:3,?4), Asherah, and Anath are presented in an Egyptian text as both mother-goddesses and as sacred prostitutes who, paradoxically, remain ever-virgin (literally, “the great goddesses who conceive but do not bear”). Their worship apparently was invariably involved with the services of temple prostitutes. These goddesses symbolized the quality not only of sexual lust but also of sadistic violence and warfare. Thus, the goddess Anath is depicted in the Baal Epic from Ugarit as effecting a general slaughter of men and then decorating herself with suspended heads and attaching men’s hands to her girdle while she joyfully wades in their blood. The figurines of the goddess Ashtoreth that have been discovered in Palestine are of a nude woman with rudely exaggerated sex organs. Of their phallic worship, archaeologist W.?F. Albright observes that: “At its worst, .?.?. the erotic aspect of their cult must have sunk to extremely sordid depths of social degradation.”—Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, 1968, pp. 76,?77; see ASHTORETH; BAAL No. 4.<br>  <br>  Added to their other degrading practices was that of child sacrifice. According to Merrill F.?Unger: “Excavations in Palestine have uncovered piles of ashes and remains of|`|mdxwYQJTaa	do you know the hearts of men ? why did God rain fire and brimstone on sodom ? they were evil in the sight of God and his judgment is true so will you now judge God? but wait he will judge you!!|`|nC9TGrfGaa	"So exactly why is death so bad?"<br>  <br>  What are you, a psychopath?

Jesus told us it would be this way. Keep in mind that although we live in this world, we are not OF this world.

I mean, you should help people if they ask you, but you shouldn't be too generous to everybody. Some people you should keep a distance from. I am a Christian, and I believe it is never wrong being good to people. But you need to be wise in how you act with people. In my childhood I over-did generosity by giving most of my favorite things away to people in school. However, people began to take advantage and ask for everything and I would agree. This isn't very wise. Generosity is good, but you need to know when and where to use it properly. However, there are cases where you were kind or you did something good but in return you get spit in the face. That's what happened to Jesus since you brought up the topic of spirituality. Today it is dangerous to even give a pat on the shoulder because in one case someone claimed to be "abused." Also, society is becoming more corrupt to where they have dirty language and talk and they tolerate all sorts immorality, a lot of people don't stand for any values and live however they please. Therefore, continue to try your best in being a good person. And just because other people may swear and curse at you, don't just give up and certainly don't join them. You should never give up some values just because the majority may not follow them. <br>  Good luck :)|`|lxQ8dLC5aa	Being good rarely has benefits in the short term, only in the long term.

It almost undoubtedly<br>  is referring to the Arabic Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). The 5th chapter of Songs of Solomon is discussing someone. Jews will say it is discussing Solomon, while Christians will say it is discussing Jesus. Considering<br>  this is the Songs of Solomon, it would seem logical that it is discussing Solomon. The verses describing this mystery man have the narators speech conjuagted<br>  in the feminine (meaning it is a woman who is describing this man) so it is possible that it is one of Solomon's wives discussing her Husband (Solomon).<br>  However, if a Christian tries to assert that Jesus is being discussed, then they are insinuating that this is discussing a future prophet (a man who was<br>  not yet alive at that point), a prophesy.... If the 5th chapter of Songs of Solomon is looking into the future, then there is no doubt it is discussing<br>  Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). Throughout the chapter, someone is being discussed. Whomever it is, verse 15 says his "countenance (face) is as Lebanon", so this is an Arabic gentleman<br>  (or Arab looking), a Semitic man none the less. Verse 11 says "his head is as the most fine gold, his locks are wavy, and black as a raven". Verse 10 describes<br>  this man as being "radiant and ruddy" which means he was slightly light-skinned with a rosy color. This can be confirmed in the Sahih Bukhari Hadiths,<br>  Volume 4, Book 56, Number 747, which says Muhammad was slightly light skinned, with a rosy color (and also has the same hair as is mentioned in verse 11).<br>  Also verse 14 describes this man as having a stomach like ivory. I take it this means the parts of his body that were usually covered by his garment from<br>  the sun, were very white (like ivory). This also can be atributed to Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) who although having a rosy, golden color, had white armpitts<br>  (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 2, Book 17, Number 141 says you could see the whites of his armpitt when he raised his hand). WHAT'S THE POINT?!?! Discussing skin color, and hair color is fruitless, and if I was basing it solely on that, it could be describing ANY Semitic man. However, this person's<br>  name is given. In reading the English translation of Songs 5:16 it finishes the description by saying "He is altogether lovely". The words "altogether<br>  lovely" was translated from mahmad (). We'll take a closer look at this four character word, and prove this is talking about Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)<br>  . . . . . First of all, the way this word is written is Hebrew is . That happens to be the EXACT same was Muhammad's name is written in Hebrew. Let's look at the<br>  spelling of this word...<br>  It has four characters. Going from right to left they are... Now, when writing in Hebrew, there is no difference between the word mahmad () and Muhammad (). The only difference is in the vowels used when pronouncing<br>  this word (). Hebrew is an ancient language, and there are no vowels. It is made up of 22 consonants. In ancient times, the reader decided on his own which<br>  vowels to add in. It was not until the 8th century that vowels were introduced, in the form of dots and lines. However, this has nothing to do with real<br>  Hebrew. The word mahmad () in ancient times would most likely have been pronounced "mahamad". According to Ben Yehuda's Hebrew-English Dictionary,  is correctly pronounced "mahamad" (not mahmad) which is very close to Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).<br>  Ben Yehuda's Hebrew-English Dictionary defines "" as "lovely, coveted one, precious one, praised one". The correct way to say "praised one" in Arabic is<br>  Muhammad, so this is the same word! As was stated before, the name Muhammad () and the word mahmad () are spelled exactly the same way in Hebrew, and both have the same meaning. The only reason<br>  they are pronounced different is because of vowels (dots and lines) introduced in the eigth century. The Hebrew word for praised one is<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word for Muhammad (the Arabic Prophet) is In conclusion, if Songs of Solomon chapter 5 is discussing a man to come after that time, it is without a doubt Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), as it even<br>  mentions his name.

Think, too, of the Equidistant Letter Skips, or ELS, of the 'Bible Code'; although there are many exaples where we see Jesus named as Messiah, including such phrases as "Behold the blood of Jesus", we find, using the same ELS sequence, "Behold the blood of Koresh". Are we to regard this as referring to David Koresh, responsible for the Waco Siege? No: Koresh was a false prophet.<br>  Please consider, too, the fact that Mohammed denied Jesus was God.<br>  Yet the Bible specifically said Messiah (i.e. the Anointed One, the Greek form of which is Christ) would be 'cut off' i.e. KILLED, 483 years after permission to rebuild the Jewish Temple had been given (see Daniel chapter 9). Consider too that Messiah would be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), that this Son would be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace (Is. 9:6, 7), that the Jews would reject Him (e.g. Psalm 118:22; Is. 52:13-53:12),<br>  but that He would bless those who believed on Him (e.g. Is. 49:6).<br>  <br>  Please consider too, that ANY who denied Jesus is CHRIST [come] IN THE FLESH (e.g. 1 John 4:2, 3; 2 Jn. 1:7) is an anti-Christ, i.e. anti-God. Mohammed denied Jesus died, that He is God; he said that He was not God's only-begotten Son despite Psalm 2:<br>  <br>   Ps. 2: 7 ? I will declare the decree: the LORD [YHWH] hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. 8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.<br>  10 ? Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<br>  11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<br>  12 Kiss the Son [an order to obey the Son; to treat Him with great respect; to worship in love], lest ***he*** be angry, and ye perish from the way, when ***his*** wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him [i.e. to have faith in; to cling to, to hope in, this Son].<br>  <br>  see that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit explicitly mentioned in the Old Testament, not just the New:<br>  <br>  Is. 48:16<br>  <br>  16 ?Come ye near unto ***me***, hear ye this; **I** have not spoken in secret from the beginning; ***from the time that it was, there am I*** [already]: and now the Lord GOD [‘Lord YHWH’], and his Spirit, hath sent me. (Is. 48:16, KJV). (See also Micah 5:2, for Jesus’ being eternal NB: some modern translations state ‘... from old, from ancient times.’, whereas the KJV says ‘... from of old, from everlasting.’ The Hebrew is ‘yom olam’; it means literally ‘the days of eternity’).<br>  <br>  Please, look at these and other verses. and prayerfully consider the truth of these claims. Also, look up the following websites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thebereancall.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebereancall.org</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lightforthelastdays.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightforthelastdays.co.uk</a><br>  <br>  Also search for Walid Shoebat on the internet; Walid is a former PLO terrorist who became a christian, as did the son of the head of Hamas in either Gaza or Lebanon (I forget which: it may be the son of the head of a different extremist Moslem organisation; but he too became aChristian).<br>  <br>  May God bless you if you are willing to pray to Him -- the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob -- for sincere guidance on this.<br>  <br>  May God bless also ALL who sincerely seek His truth regarding Jesus and salvation.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Mohammed was a prophet of God.

So your claim looses sufficient steam to call it into question as is. <br>  <br>  Languages of the Orient (which include Aramaic, and Hebrew) rely on many similar phonetic sounds that are distinctly different to the Oriental ear.<br>  <br>  Neither Mohammed, nor Muhammad appear in text(s) as proper names.

And in the Old Tesament language and dialects, Allah is not Elahh, the God of the Bible. <br>  <br>  You seem to be "hooked on fonix."

If you show you can speak them well, that's fine, but some might be picky about certifications--it just depends on which jobs you apply to.<br>  <br>  For one thing, make sure you are surrounded by the languages; Try listening to music, watching films, reading, etc. Have you're dad or other family members who can help speak to you in Spanish, and practice everyday!|`|9EVcTnUWaa	Learning Spanish and German would make you tri-lingual which in our country would be a very good thing.  Unless you find a job were you had to write in any of those languages it wouldn't matter to your employer if you only spoke it and didn't write it.  The more languages that a person is fluent in the better for them and the easier it is to deal in a multi-cultural world.  I would say stick with as many languages as you can learn.  My daughter is learning Sign language which is another one that we need more people to know.|`|ImSBmkYxaa	I don't think so. You are lucky to even know other languages. Because it would be really good on any application or job interview that you are trilingual or bilingual because other people might only speak Spanish and you know that language. And maybe you can talk with your friends in Spanish so that way you and them only understand it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  :D|`|4qmqN18Laa	I don't think U are waisting time...

My friend is fluent in both Spanish and French. When you grow up you could be a translater! I learned from my Spanish teacher that she got 13 cents per word! Per word! It's pretty awesome.

I love leanrning Spanish though. <br>  <br>  Me encanta hablo en espanol!|`|qaiYanF2aa	It would be great to have a working, talking knowlege of both languages, however, do not get too overwhelmed.  I wld think a little later after German is mastered you could then go pick up Spanish.  But you need to do what you feel you can do.  Reach for the stars!<br>  <br>  Regarding employment - you did not say what area you were looking for employment in?  If it is something that German would help you in then I certainly would concentrate on it, but if Spanish would be more important I might take the leap and work on it, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
ErXKMHGAaa	We are not dogs or horses, do not refer to us as "pure blooded" - it is derogatory. We are people, human beings like yourself.<br>  <br>  Many of the southern tribes have wavy hair, not necessarily "curly". I am Muskogee Creek, and in the summer when it is very humid, my hair tends to be wavy, not curly. This is not unusual for people in my Nation.<br>  <br>  Not many First Nations tribes (Canada)have even the slightest hint of wavy hair. It is usually straight, straight, straight.<br>  <br>  Amerindian tribes (tribes south of the US) mainly developed "curly" hair after the conquistadors, but this does not mean that they aren't or weren't any less an Amerindian. <br>  <br>  There is proof that some Aztecs, Inca and Maya did have wavy hair as seen on precolumbian hieroglyphs and figurines of some gods and rulers with wavy hair.<br>  <br>  Native Hawaiians have had curly hair since the first Polynesian came to Hawaii, but that's another story all together.|`|Shp5riE6aa	They did in the Pacific northwest.

3RQkgTSOaa	Seems to me she's missing the point of going to mass if she's hung up on the superficial aspect of WHO is doing it.

Yes, people would probably PREFER the funny, charming one but if you need dental work (or absolution) does it really matter WHO administers it?<br>  <br>  And besides (and pardon me if you find this offensive) but to me, God is EVERYWHERE, not JUST in the House of the Lord so I can commune with Him anywhere I like.

I for one find that completly wrong but try telling her that if you're trying to be a good catholic, not going to church just because there isnt the preist she wants there isn't good. Tell her that as catholics we need to go to church every Sunday. It's ok to like a Priest because i like some of the priest that go to my church as well but, she needs to know that obsession IS A SIN as well...To be honest you just need to sit down with her and ask her why she really feels this way and good luck I'll be praying for you ; D

MRDJu8v3aa	Like racism, sexism is historical. People make decisions based on either Love or Fear. Sexism is based on the male fear of being metaphorically castrated by women. It is all about power, domination, and control. <br>  <br>  I am not sure what you mean when you say that some laws belittle men. I do not feel belittled when I acknowledge that a woman is my equal or even much better than I. Certainly, I do not think I would ever get pregnant knowing that I would have to grow the labor LOL. <br>  <br>  I agree, having children is not nearly as expensive as we make it.  The United States is full of “keeping up with the Jones” type families. Although officially part of the Lower Class (less than $20k per year), I feel blessed. I do shop at outlet stores, second hand stores, day old bread stores… I clip coupons and hardly ever buy brand name products. And yet I still fell the embarrassment of having to do so.|`|FK9Z75Staa	How about you stop complaining and do something about it?|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	I am shocked by the first answer. "I don't care about yours or my rights."? Thank you for telling me. Now I know how I feel.<br>  <br>  The world is full of sexism because at times people want as much as they can get with the least amount of effort required to get it. Additionally, if one does not have to accept culpability for what one does, even better. This applies to both some men, and some women.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for male's point of view, we can be lied about in court about abusing our children, have the same court give the mother our children without proving these allegations, effectively losing custody of our children even when we want them every bit as the mother does and to top it off, it has been said that men only want their children to avoid paying child support, however the same is never said of women.<br>  <br>  Fair? Of course not, but women don't care because in that instance, they are getting what they want, better than 50% custody and child support. <br>  <br>  The above isn't going to change until enough women have their lives destroyed through divorce in the same way that men have in this matter. Only at that point will women care about what happens to men because they will suffer the same plight.<br>  <br>  A man can get married, be faithful (there are those of us that are), have her decide that she wants to leave and she gets to turn our lives upside down because she wants something new...it happens every day and what is worse is that society accepts this as being fair because not enough men have stood up and done something about it yet as opposed to the feminist's movement over the last 4 decades.<br>  <br>  The women have gone from not working at all to becoming the CEO's of large multi-national corporations. This was unheard of in the past and women have done much to further their cause in the last few years.<br>  <br>  Do injuctices towards women still exist? Of course they do and it is important that we fix them as they come to light. Unfortunately, when a point is brought up in regards to the societal outlook that is cast upon men these days, people all too often don't care as long as they have whatever it is that they desire i.e. not me, not my problem.<br>  <br>  There is good news. We men are taking notice. The divorce rate is declining and if you take anything and make the consequences of it negative enough, such as has been done with marriage (and regardless of what some women may say, several of we males certainly see marriage in this light), one will stop doing it altogether because it is just too costly.<br>  <br>  People want equal rights? Sooner or later they get them, sometimes it comes at a cost that one might not want.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	This went from a question about sexism to a rant about how people should not have kids. Women and Men are equal of course but I don't care if a law "supresses" a man's rights because they don't. In fact it's women who have been supressed in the past. No laws really belittle a man's rights.|`|xCFHGyWsaa	A fellow Texan agrees with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why is it that nobody wants to work for a living anymore?

On the other hand, they were in danger of being raised by evil parents who most likely would not have taught them to walk with the Lord like Noah did before they reached the age of accountability.<br>  <br>  So they were evil in nature but not yet guilty of law breaking. Therefore God showed them great mercy by taking them away to be with Him before they were doomed to join their wicked parents in the holding tank of Sheol to await the resurrection of the damned.<br>  <br>  Genesis 6:5  Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<br>  <br>  Here is where the idea of an age of accountability comes from among other passages.<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 1:35  'Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land of which I swore to give to your fathers,  36  except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land on which he walked, because he wholly followed the LORD.'  37  The LORD was also angry with me for your sakes, saying, 'Even you shall not go in there.  38  Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there.

God is pure good, and you just can't understand that."<br>  <br>  Or, "Everybody has to die sometime."<br>  <br>  Or, "The babies were *going* to be wicked."<br>  <br>  Basically, you get a lot of religious people justifying wholesale killing on a planetary scale -- actually, not just justifying it, but *celebrating* it as an expression of pure righteousness.<br>  <br>  And here's how you know that Christians are not reasonable: You never NEVER see a Christian say something along the lines of "Yeah, to tell you the truth, I struggle with that one.

You see, women are encouraged to not stay silent about these things (and I agree), but if a man is abused by a woman and reports it. He is a sissy. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to meet violence with violence if you are defending yourself, but only if you are defending yourself against a man.

vuRejUo3aa	If you believe in God, then why do you miss to feel the 'wisdom' & 'knowledge' of the surgeons who got the merit of doing surgery on?

There are a lot of "beautiful people" who are unkind to others... ugly inside.|`|EM0kiImHaa	The Bible doesn’t specifically address a Christian having plastic surgery or cosmetic surgery. There is nothing in the Bible to indicate that plastic surgery in and of itself is wrong. However, there are several things that one needs to consider before deciding whether or not to have these procedures. Altering one's body is unnatural, and there are always risks of potential side effects – both physically and mentally. No one should allow themselves to be put "under the knife" without thoroughly researching all alternatives, risks, and side effects involved with the surgery. A person also needs to fully understand his or her motivation for desiring the surgery. For many who were either born with or later acquire physical deformities, it is natural to want to fit into society and feel "normal." There are also cases of slight abnormalities that would cause someone to feel very uncomfortable with themselves, such as a very large or misshapen nose. But many, if not most, plastic surgeries are done as attempts to meet emotional voids in physical ways, to attract attention, or to seek approval from others.<br>  <br>  According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the most commonly performed cosmetic procedures include breast augmentation/lifts, liposuction (the removal of body fat), facelifts, eyelid lifts, buttock and other body lifts, leg vein treatments, botox/fat injections, and nose and face reshaping. Approximately two million people subject themselves to these kinds of procedures each year, shelling out money and sacrificing time and comfort. When the motivation of a person undergoing surgery is that of vanity, he or she has become his or her own idol. The Bible warns us not to be vain or conceited (Philippians 2:3-4) and not to draw attention to ourselves by the way we look (1 Timothy 2:9). Another concern would be the cost. Most insurance companies do not cover costs associated with cosmetic surgery, so the expenses would all come out of the patient's pocket. This is a major consideration because most people have families that have needs to be taken care of and the expense of plastic surgery should never come before the needs of the family. The Bible also tells us that we need to use wisely the money that God has entrusted to us (Proverbs 11:24-25; Luke 16:10-12).<br>  <br>  The most important thing to do before making the decision to undergo plastic surgery would be to consult God about the issue. The Bible tells us that God cares about every worry and concern that we have, so we should take our problems to Him (1 Peter 5:7). Through the wisdom and guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God, we have the ability to make decisions that will please and honor Him. "Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised" (Proverbs 31:30). Even the most skilled surgeon cannot hold back the hands of time and all cosmetic surgeries will eventually have the same result – aging. Those lifted body parts will sag again and those cosmetically altered facial features will eventually wrinkle. Far better to work on beautifying the person underneath “that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight” (1 Peter 3:4).
KVVD3B9vaa	I lost a lot of respect for him but I'm sure I heard that He'd quit it?|`|2e34ws6zaa	Actually, he still continues the claim that he is a Christian.  It is certainly valid to speculate this, however, since he is not only close friends with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but he donated close to $122,500 to the Church of Scientology.<br>  <br>  We can't say for sure if he is a Scientologist or not, but he certainly doesn't do anything to prove otherwise.|`|AAGW4kAhaa	I was a little surprised, but then I thought about the path of his career.

He's a good actor, and I like his movies.|`|xrajqHbgaa	Wow, I'm pissed.|`|ZOifSvNhaa	I thought that he maybe searching for truth. but he will not be happy unless scientology answers these qyestions  <br>      * Does God really care about us?<br>      * Will war and suffering ever end?<br>      * What happens to us when we die?<br>      * Is there any hope for the dead?<br>      * How can I pray and be heard by God?<br>      * How can I find happiness in life?<br>  <br>  it does not answer those questions. but the answers<br>  <br>  Does God Really Care About Us?<br>  WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: We live in a world full of cruelty and injustice. Many religions teach that the sufferings we experience are God’s will.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: God never causes what is wicked. “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!” says Job 34:10. God has a loving purpose for humans. That is why Jesus taught us to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let . . . your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 6:9, 10) God cares so deeply about us that he has gone to great lengths to make the fulfillment of his purpose a certainty.—John 3:16.<br>  <br>  See also Genesis 1:26-28; James 1:13; and 1 Peter 5:6, 7.<br>  Will War and Suffering Ever End?<br>  <br>  WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: War continues to claim untold numbers of human lives. All of us have been touched by human suffering.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: God foretells a time when he will establish peace earth wide. Under his Kingdom, a heavenly government, people will not “learn war anymore.” Instead, they will “beat their swords into plowshares.” (Isaiah 2:4) God will bring an end to all injustice and suffering. The Bible promises: “[God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things [including today’s injustices and sufferings] have passed away.”—Revelation 21:3, 4.<br>  <br>  See also Psalm 37:10, 11; 46:9; and Micah 4:1-4.<br>  What Happens to Us When We Die?<br>  <br>  WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: Most of the world’s religions teach that something inside a person continues living after death. Some hold that the dead can harm the living or that God punishes the wicked by condemning them to eternal torment in a fiery hell.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: At death, humans cease to exist. “The dead . . . are conscious of nothing at all,” states Ecclesiastes 9:5. Since the dead cannot know, feel, or experience anything, they cannot harm—or help—the living.—Psalm 146:3, 4.<br>  <br>  See also Genesis 3:19 and Ecclesiastes 9:6, 10.<br>  Is There Any Hope for the Dead?<br>  A child grieving the death of a loved one<br>  <br>  WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: We want to live, and we want to enjoy life with those we love. It is only natural that we yearn to see our dead loved ones again.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: Most people who have died will be resurrected. Jesus promised that “those in the memorial tombs will . . . come out.” (John 5:28, 29) In harmony with God’s original purpose, those resurrected as humans will have the opportunity to live on a paradise earth. (Luke 23:43) This promised future includes perfect health and everlasting life for obedient humans. The Bible says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”—Psalm 37:29.<br>  <br>  See also Job 14:14, 15; Luke 7:11-17; and Acts 24:15.<br>  How Can I Pray and Be Heard by God?<br>  <br>  WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: People in practically all religions pray. Yet, many feel that their prayers are not answered.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: Jesus taught us to avoid repeating set formulas in our prayers. “When praying,” he said, “do not say the same things over and over again.” (Matthew 6:7) If we want God to listen to our prayers, we must pray in the way that he approves. To do that, we need to learn what God’s will is and then pray accordingly. First John 5:14 explains: “No matter what it is that we ask according to [God’s] will, he hears us.”<br>  <br>  See also Psalm 65:2; John 14:6, 14; and 1 John 3:22.<br>  How Can I Find Happiness in Life?<br>  A woman searching for happiness by reading the Bible<br>  <br>  WHY THE QUESTION ARISES: Many people believe that money, fame, or beauty will make them happy. Hence, they pursue such things—only to find that happiness eludes them.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES: Jesus identified the key to happiness when he said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matthew 5:3) True happiness can be found only if we take steps to fill our greatest need—our hunger for spiritual truth about God and his purpose for us. That truth is found in the Bible. Knowing that truth can help us to discern what is really important and what is not. Allowing Bible truth to guide our decisions and actions leads to a more meaningful life.—Luke 11:28.<br>  <br>  See also Proverbs 3:5, 6, 13-18 and 1 Timothy 6:9, 10.<br>  <br>  This has been just a brief look at the Bible’s answers to six questions. Do you want to know more than that? If you are among those “conscious of their spiritual need,” no doubt you do.

8PA58u3kaa	I think for this issue it depends more on the region than the time. Teens in a small town full of bigots in the south (just to use as an example) may probably have a harder time than one living in a more liberal area with a higher acceptance. That said, I do think that there is more acceptance today than there was 20 plus years ago, I myself am only 19 but I've spoken with many gays and lesbians from different age brackets.|`|FHLKpNv4aa	Im a teenager and im gay and i don't have it easy.We are accepted more now,but everyone seems to think that they are bi,when they are not.So now one takes the true gays seriously.And we still face some discrimination,its not all hugs yet.|`|ve7psnD3aa	not easy, but easier. it's still hard to come out in today's society and will always be until we can all learn to get along.

AA11923447	Sometimes, being out in Nature will do it, especially if I'm at the beach. There's something about the ocean that is very spiritually meaningful to me. Also, religious services (those of my own faith or those of other religions) can put me in a spiritual frame of mind, as can chanting and meditation. Giving and receiving love of any sort is a highly spiritual thing for me.|`|332vXA6oaa	Reading the Bible 3 times per year. Intense praying 3 times a day. Going out to the witnessing work 5 days a week.  Attending Bible meetings on a regular basis.|`|8pQrIL90aa	You must first have a spirit to be spiritual, and the only spirit that we should have is the spirit of God, which is the Lord Jesus. After that, walking in the spirit is explained in the new testament, how we are present ourselves in this land of evil spirits as a light of truth. There are those who have spirits, but they are evil spirits. Porn stars, wealthy eccentric people, murders, rapist etc. All have spirits and even gamblers. <br>  <br>  But we should strive to get the spirit of God and abide in the word of the Lord Jesus. This is how we walk in the light everyday.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Talking to my Luey makes me feel spiritual. Anyways you are all communicating well with your Lueys, but you can ask them questions.

Whether it be evolution, the big bang theory or what ever else allowed man to exist has to be something powerful.  I've witnessed certain cultures in Africa (remember Egypt is a country there) advocate that their ancestors believed that the sun was God.  Not the way that people think of God today (heaven, hell, angels & demons) but merely the one thing that gave them life and that they/we could not live without.  So, regardless of what "let's" us be.... I think it has to be something greater than me.|`|6aIuZZi7aa	Nature.

I see the need for those policies to right wrongs of the past and level the playing field.<br>  <br>  Do you think it is fair that in the not so distant past (and to a lesser degree today) that white skin color was/is given preferential treatment? And that all white people enjoy the benefits of that today?<br>  <br>  The presidency is a perfect example. We had an incompetent white president who got there through family connections. And now we have an extraordinary black man who got there by overcoming extraordinary odds. It still remains to be seen if he will be a good president, but that's not my point.

Jesus overcame all three of Satan's temptations by citing scripture to the devil, at which point the devil left him, angels ministered to Jesus, and he began his ministry. Jesus further said that his disciples should fast "when the bridegroom shall be taken from them" (Matthew 9:15), a reference to his Passion. Since, presumably, the Apostles fasted as they mourned the death of Jesus, Christians have traditionally fasted during the annual commemoration of his burial.<br>  <br>  It is the traditional belief that Jesus lay for forty hours in the tomb[4] which led to the forty hours of total fast that preceded the Easter celebration in the early Church[5] (the biblical reference to 'three days in the tomb' is understood as spanning three days, from Friday afternoon to early Sunday morning, rather than three 24 hour periods of time).|`|TotgRmRZaa	your really looking for things to talk about.you must have just come from a revival meeting in the south.the only thing in common the devil has in lent.is he tried to tempt jesus.jesus told him to get lost.the chicken **** that he is he did.|`|cvp0SEBNaa	umm how is lent a doctrine of satan again?<br>  <br>  I've read the passage not sure what you are getting at<br>  \<br>  praying to go is satanic?|`|tiBXaoRPaa	Deff not true.<br>  Lent has been a sermon of God, not satin|`|AA10873763	I don't believe in gods or Satan, but I do believe in Lent.<br>  It has cultural roots that go beyond religion.  At the end of a long winter, fresh meat was scarce.  Dried fish and root vegetables were just about all that was left.<br>  It's also a handy time to give up my bad "holiday habits", I've found.|`|AA11923447	I remain unconcerned about your opinion. First of all, I'm not a Biblical literalist. My church does not subscribe to either Sola Scriptura or literalism. If you do not wish to observe Lent, then don't. But to barge in and tell other people how to handle their own spiritual development and observances makes no sense. Practice your faith in your own way, and I'll practice mine. Then again, maybe some people just enjoy creating strife and division among their fellow Christians.

FATyhyZ2aa	Maybe they just freak out here on "Questions" b/c it so hard to tell tone & sincerity to inquire.  I asked a question about Sabbath day & was misunderstood that I was pushing a doctrine when I just wanted to know IF & WHY & WHEN Christians observed Sabbath.  One replier was kind enough to answer my e-mail when he seemed offended.  So I think that I just asked the question the wrong way.  /  As to opposing "cruelty" in the OT, I think it's lack of seeing the thread of Messiah revealed in all things OT.  Like, after all the listing of animal sacrifices, people assume animal cruelty on mass scale.  But these sacrifices, on the humanistic side, provided food for the Levites who had no other job for income AND they were allowed to sell of what they could not consume which gave them an income as other 12 tribes.  BUT Scriptures has YHWH stating that "I desire mercy, not scarifices."  Wouldn't that seem contradictory after He'd gone through great lengths to specifically detail HOW to sacrifice?  The point missed is like, "See how much you have to go through just to make yourselfs right w/ Me & even that does not work."  Point being, prepare yourselves for a Messiah to come which will become the only sacrifice needed ONCE & for all time.  A lot of cruelty dealt w/ "You're gonna do it anyway, so here's some foundations to follow to have some aspect of compassion."  There is a difference between YHWH's laws & Moses judgements.  YHWH "hates divorce."  Moses saw that people were doing it anyway & gave them commands about not being so abusive in the process.  Things like that.|`|RhDPB70Baa	There are only two options: either the bible is perfectly true, which means you're disobeying it by not stoning your children and are going to hell, or the bible is wrong in places, making it completely invalid (if one part is wrong then it's not infallible) which means Christianity is a lie.<br>  <br>  No other alternatives.|`|Jt565VJxaa	They like to shove the OT under the proverbial rug and pretend it doesn't govern them.

To be Christian means to be christ like.  A True christian does not teach of his own reasoning, he teaches from scripture.  Call the OT what you will, it is human history. It is Jewish Law before the new covenant . It is what it is. The NT shows how we as a species have been shown a more loving way by a God who loves his children, the new covenant. The Christian Covenant<br>  A christian without Scripture to guide him, is a ship without a compass.|`|AA11923447	I answered that question. I was in no way hateful in my response. I said, plainly and calmly, that I am not a Biblical literalist, and that I do not condone slavery, misogyny, homophobia and other things that are presented in the Old Testament. If it makes you happy (and even if it doesn't), I don't take the New Testament literally, either. I was not rude, and did not cut and paste Scripture. I was not defensive, except to mention that not all Christians are Biblical literalists, because we aren't (that is a common misconception among non-believers). I am still not being hateful, nor am I "butthurt", as you so quaintly put it. You are suggesting that every answer to that question by a Christian was hateful. I simply do not see how my response was hateful.|`|AA11232725	I can't speak for what other people who claim to be Christians do. All I can say is that when you understand that God is the sovereign Creator of this universe, that He is perfect and we have all broken His laws, that because of His love He sent the Lord Jesus to make a way for us to be reconciled to Him, then you understand the majors of what the Bible is there to teach us.<br>  <br>  If you want to major in the minors and ask questions like "Well if God is loving then why...." and pick out some incident in the Bible to base your question on...<br>  <br>  I would just point you back to the majors. <br>  <br>  Romans 3:23  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br>  <br>  Romans 5:8  But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  God doesn't owe any one of the beings that He created an explanation or anything else. He brought us into existence by His power and He can take us out just as quickly. What we need to do is to each one of us stop our personal rebellion that started with our ancestors in the Garden of Eden and take the way that God made for us to be reconciled to Him by acknowledging Jesus as our Lord and Savior.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	If you wanted to discuss the bible seriously you should seek people who actually study the bible and take ministry to heart.<br>  <br>  Coming here is like going to a play ground in a large city in America and asking the children there why is the US constitution so complicated.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You just explained it in your ham-fisted non-grammatical way. <br>  <br>  Not nice - defensive.<br>  Wonderful -- awesome.<br>  <br>  True, you are boring so maybe there is a better expression of it.

That is if you wish to be helpful.<br>  <br>  Now, I agree that some seeming not so nice and some not so nice things happened in both OT and NT.  Some are easily defended and some not so, but depending on how a person phrases a question can change the way they might answer.  Then there are those that perceive intent or are just nasty I am sure if you read enough opposing views here such as Atheists you will see the same.  I have read very nice Atheists that have a better grip of scripture show how Christians are not living up to what they believe.

On any honest read, the God who is depicted in scripture occasionally behaves in ways which we wouldn't judge too kindly were God a human being.<br>  <br>  Now, on the one hand, it is possible to understand these episodes as instances of the Biblical authors projecting their own prejudices, bigotries, and desire for vengeance upon God.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's also possible to (though not strictly orthodox) to say that God's character has changed gradually over time.<br>  <br>  But getting defensive and angry and trying to pretend that the bloody-handedness of God that is depicted in scripture isn't actually there is completely bootless.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Relax and have a cup of Kool-Aid. <VBG><br>  <br>  The Bible is definitely NOT the Word of God. If God really wanted to write a book Jesus would have done it Himself and there would be no questions about it. It would also be a very different book.<br>  <br>  No matter how inspired the authors were or by what source, the information had to filter through their minds and personalities. The Bible was written by men immersed in an ancient patriarchal culture. They all had agendas, whether it was keeping the social order, unifying doctrine, eliminating heresy or gaining converts. For me, it's a pretty transparent piece of propaganda.<br>  <br>  What I do value in the Bible is the story of Christ's life and teachings. I think He knew how misinterpreted and manipulated words can become and therefore lived in a way that would allow us to follow in His footsteps regardless of what anyone wrote about Him.<br>  <br>  The links below objectively detail the origins of the Bible (1)<br>  as well as the inconsistencies and inaccuracies (2)|`|tI1NHwfBaa	The simple answer is that Christians don't freak out.  They're simply bored and aggravated by a bunch of people who refuse to understand the importance of context.<br>  <br>  How many times have I typed this in Yahoo Answers?  Context is everything!  Whether you're reading your newspaper or Shakespeare, context matters.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament commands that everyone likes to pluck out of context and thrust at Christians are all the same.  Whether it's the ban on eating shellfish, or the declaration that fabrics can't be mixed, or the prohibition of people with dwarfism from approaching the altar, they're all the same.<br>  <br>  They NEVER applied to Christians.  These commands were all given to the early Israelites, under the leadership of Moses.  God called the Israelites to be different from the rest of the world, as a testimony to their faith in God and a reminder of what he had done for them.<br>  <br>  Just because a command is given in the Bible doesn't mean it applies to everyone.  Some commands are given to a group of people, some are given to an individual.  Some commands are given for all time, and some are given for a specific period.<br>  <br>  It's the CONTEXT that makes the difference.<br>  <br>  I can't count the number of Bible detractors that find something like these old commands for Israel, suddenly consider themselves to be very clever, and then present them to Christians thinking they've somehow been smart enough -- all on their own -- to find the Achillies' Heel of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Really, it's just stupid.  And tired.  And trite.  And ignorant.<br>  <br>  And it shows just how foolish and blinkered some people are in their attempts to impeach the Bible's credibility.<br>  <br>  Where you see the "wonderful" things in the Old Testament like the exodus of the Jewish people, the story of Noah and the Ark, etc., you see exactly the same message  that Jesus Christ taught: Grace.  That's God's free gift of forgiveness that is given without it being deserved.  I like that message wherever I see it -- Old Testament, New Testament, or some other place.|`|yhTPcF81aa	Yeah, they love to plaster on signs and posters how homosexuality is a sin according to the old testament.  But they never say anything about how slavery, beating and killing your wife and children, and selling your daughter into sex slavery is perfectly ok according to the old testament.     And then they say that the old testament was INSPIRED by god and men mixed it up.  So, all of those things were just typos.... except the part about homos.  That was perfectly correct.  They will burn in hell for eternity and we should make their lives on earth a living hell.

OP8sRCbTaa	The town was celebrating the bicentennial* of it's creation with a festival.  It's 200th year was a huge deal.  It was much bigger than the one they had for their centennial* celebration, and that festival seemed to be perennial*.  For the 100th year of it's existence, they threw a party that seemed to last forever!  They had bilateral* jousting competitions, which involved the two different sides of town; the French and Spanish citizens.  Then the loser would be deprived the right to eat dinner, which was a very negative unilateral* consequence.  Fortunately it only affected one side of town.  After the jousting, they had all the voracious* children take place in a pie eating contest, where the little boys and girls devoured* all kinds of pies.  They were seemingly overwhelmed with the desire to eat, the pies disappeared into their stomachs super fast.  Then after that competition, the older men read the manuscript* for the town.  It was a hand written document that was 200 years old, just like the town.  After that, the woman took place in a knitting contest, which was extremely manual*.  It required the extent use of their hands.  The woman were so competitive; they were carnivorous* towards each other.  It's like they were hunting for human flesh.|`|R42mL1p2aa	i dont get it..you seem to have done it yourself??<br>  carnivorous: A meat eating organism? that sort of thing?

AA11245447	There are quite a few Jews (I can only speak for Jews) here; Jesus does not impact our religion at all.  He's not even a prophet, so he cannot be a false prophet.<br>  To those of us (me included) that believe he existed, he was pretty much an upstart young man.  Obviously, others will have other opinions, but the point is that we don't think about Jesus at all.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	There's quite a few Jews on here, and the question about how we see Jesus is asked at least once a day.  You could have found a whole set of answers on this with little effort.  I'll give you a brief version, and leave it to you to have a quick search for more if you want it.<br>  <br>  Jesus has no place of any sort in Judaism.  We have no opinion on him any more than we do on Krishna, Zeus or any other deity of any other religion.  We don't like him, we don't hate him, we don't think he's a prophet of any sort, we just don't have any interest in him.  <br>  <br>  Of the 23 Jewish prophecies concerning the messiah, Jesus fulfilled just one - he was Jewish.  There were dozens of young men preaching various reforms of Judaism at the time - it was one of those eras of foment in the religion.  We know our messiah isn't divine and doesn't do miracles, apart from anything else.|`|b3477086f60752aa221dc76da30fdb43aa	Sure, I'm out here. I don't believe that the god in the bible ever existed.

No, not really if I believe that there is something behind us and every thing else that's alive on this planet as having some kind of reasoning for our existence. But not in the normal since of thinking as we know it. Not every thing is black and white as bible thumpers try to make it out to be. You and I are living proof that something out there causes life to begin and proliferate. Just not the bearded one living in the clouds and showing dissatisfaction as to the way we behave and live.

Whatever!!|`|AA10985325	Here’s a factual description of the Scientology religion for you (From a Scientologist):<br>  <br>  Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So it’s not possible to fully explain on this forum, but I hope this helps.|`|pSNSlRlRaa	There are false prophets of Jehovah, and true ones.

It has been disproved many time on various web pages and discussion groups. These critics are still desperately attempting to convince others that the WTS politically joined the UN. <br>  <br>  The facts of the matter are that the UN itself informs the NGOs that "association of NGOs with the DPI DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THEIR INCORPORATION INTO THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM!” (Cf. ECOSOC Resolution 1296; Part II,12.)<br>  <br>  These critics need to read their own information more closely:<br>  <br>  Here is what the Information Officer of The NGO Section said when questioned about the WTS:  The question was: “Some friends of mine are concerned over the WTBTS not saying nice things about the UN is this a problem?” He answered: “You can criticize the UN. But, we would take offence if they were ...saying they were a UN organization WHEN THEY REALLY ARE NOT.”--Mr. Oleg Dzioubinski Information Officer NGO Section Department of Public Information United Nations New York, N.Y.<br>  <br>  Therefore there was absolutely no unscriptural alliance with the UN by the WTS! Except for all the misrepresentations by those deceitfully trying to discredit the WTS, these plain statements would be the end of the matter.<br>  <br>  The position of the NGO’s is only consultative; it only aids and promotes the UN’s gaining it’s objective in that the NGO advises and informs in areas which are of concern to the NGO.<br>  <br>  Article 3 of the UN charter states:  “3. The organization shall undertake to support the work of the United Nations and to promote knowledge of its principles and activities, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS OWN AIMS AND PURPOSES and the nature and scope of its competence and activities.”--ECOSOC Resolution 1296 (XLIV) Arrangements for Consultation with Non-Governmental Organizations<br>  <br>  Then section 14 repeats: “...the arrangements for consultation made with each organization should involve ONLY THE SUBJECTS for which that organization has a special competence or in which it has a special interest.”–Ibid<br>  <br>  In doing this the WTS is not promoting or condoning the methods, actions or glorification of the UN organization any more than a Witness would be promoting a government when he seeks relief from injustice from any governmental judicial authority! The Bible clearly shows that human governments are controlled by Satan and will be destroyed by God, yet Paul retained his Roman citizenship and participated in the judicial system in order to secure human rights. He promoted the principles and activities of the Roman government “in accordance with Christian aims and purposes.” We do no different!<br>  <br>  As the above quote from article 3 of the charter states, the WTS only had to promote the UN’s principles and activities in accord with the Watchtower Society’s own aims and purposes. Any claim that the WTS had to agree to support everything the UN stands for is a misrepresentation of the facts. Even the UN documents show that these NGO’s do not have to agree with the UN and, in fact, can criticize it at the above quote by Mr Dzioubinski shows.<br>  <br>  Witnesses support any government in areas which do not conflict with God’s laws, and we can become members of periphery organizations which work under governments. This is not the same as becoming part of these governments.<br>  <br>  God is going to use the UN to destroy false religion why shouldn’t we use it to promote religious freedom and human rights as long as we do not join it. We can promote it’s “ideals” without promoting it as a replacement for God’s Kingdom, which is what the religions of many of these critics have blasphemously done. Too bad these opposers don’t go clean up their own organizations' blatant apostasy instead of picking at non-issues.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Society has stated: “Registration papers filed with the United Nations that we have on file contain no statements that conflict with our Christian beliefs.”<br>  <br>  In correspondence the Watchtower Society has stated that it became a NGO to further human rights and to gain access to research material in the UN library. There is nothing secretive or misleading here. There are many claims by critics that this information was freely available at UN depositories. But, this does not appear to be the case as this quote shows: <br>  <br>  “Access: The Dag Hammarskj?ld Library is a special library . . . permission to use the Library is also given for short periods of time to advanced-level researchers who have found that materials required to complete their research are UNAVAILABLE AT DEPOSITORY LIBRARIES."--The Dag Hammarskj?ld Library"  <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/services.htm#access" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/services.htm...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  The foundation of the whole argument by critics on this subject is that the Society obligated itself to “support and promote everything the UN stands for.” This is a blatant falsehood, a major smokescreen and misrepresentation of the actual agreement originally signed by the WTS as shown by the above documentation.<br>  <br>  Again, the NGO contract states that the WTS would only support the activities of the UN “IN ACCORDANCE WITH [THE WTS’] OWN AIMS AND PURPOSES AND THE NATURE OF [THE WTS’] ACTIVITIES.”  We do not interfere with any government using it’s God given authority to “carry the sword” (Rom.13:4). God gave governments that authority and our “aim and purpose” in no way interferes with that God given position. They must answer to him as to how they used it. At the same time, we recognize that no true Christian would participate or support warfare. The association as an NGO in no way condoned nor supported warfare. <br>  <br>  The NGO position is a consultative one to the Economic and Social Council which only deals with economic and social affairs, not warfare. Please note the restrictions regarding what an NGO would be consulted on as outlined in Resolution 1296 Part II “Principles Governing the Nature of the Consultative Arrangements”:<br>  <br>  “...the arrangements for consultation made with each organization should involve ONLY THE SUBJECTS for which that organization has a special competence or in which it has a special interest. The organizations given consultative status should be limited to those whose international activities IN FIELDS SET OUT IN PARAGRAPH 1 above”--par.14 <br>  <br>  The fields set out for consultation in par.1 are: “economic, social, cultural, educational, health, scientific, technological and human rights.” These areas are repeated in Part III par.15 which again specifically states that “the nature and scope” of the NGO’s activities would be only deal with only economic, social and human rights. There was no need to participate in any promotion of the UN’s military activities.<br>  <br>  This qualification limiting the NGO’s participation to only those subjects which it has an interest in is constantly repeated in all the subsequent sections.<br>  <br>  Therefore all the evidence shows that the WTS’ obligation was only limited to its particular interests and did not have anything to do with military activity or any other such non-neutral activity.<br>  <br>  When the WTS agreed to become an NGO in 1991 the OFFICIAL registration papers did not require participation “in all areas of work of the UN.” Long after this there was a change in the official requirements for an NGO.  In 1994 a brochure was printed up stating: “A new relationship between the UN and NGOs is now being created...We have seen NGOs are taking on important new responsibilities.”<br>  <br>  Then we find the 1996 Criteria for Association of NGOs describing the work of NGOs using language that Witnesses clearly cannot agree with; encouraging political participation, strengthening and support of the UN System etc. Also, in the latest NGO brochure we find that there was in fact an official change in the relationship and requirements of NGOs. (<a href="http://www.un.org/MoreInfo/ngolink/brochure.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.un.org/MoreInfo/ngolink/broch...</a><br>  <br>  Quoting from the brochure: “After three years of negotiation, ECOSOC reviewed its arrangements for consultation with NGOs in July 1996. One outcome was ECOSOC Resolution 1996/31, which revised the arrangements for NGO consultation with ECOSOC....A second outcome...Decision 1996/297, which recommended that the General Assembly examine, at it 51st session, the QUESTION OF THE PARTICIPATION OF NGOS IN ALL AREAS OF WORK OF THE UN.”<br>  <br>  So all the previous documentation clearly confirms exactly what the WTS has said: That *after* they applied for NGO status there was a change in the language of the Criteria for Association. When this was brought to their attention they *immediately* withdrew their participation.<br>  <br>  A fair and reasonable examination of the *facts* can only lead to the conclusion that there was no “unholy alliance” with the UN. There was no contradiction of Christian principles or conflict with stated beliefs and practices of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The only “issue” here is in the overactive minds of unreasonable critics.<br>  <br>  As soon as it was pointed out to the WTS that the latest version of the “Criteria for Association of NGOs” had been changed long after they originally became an NGO and contained language that they did not agree with they IMMEDIATELY withdrew their registration. Instead of seeing this as a reasonable corrective step it is lyingly presented as some type of coverup. What rot!

I forget where, but two lesbians sued because they weren't allowed to hold their ceremony somewhere (not in CA) I'll see if I can dig it up...<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  OCEAN GROVE, New Jersey (LifeSiteNews.com) - A New Jersey lesbian couple has filed a civil rights complaint against a Christian seaside retreat association that refused to facilitate their "civil union."<br>  <br>  Harriet Bernstein and Luisa Paster filed the complaint June 19 with the state attorney general's office on the grounds of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation after the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association declined the use of their Boardwalk Pavilion for their civil union ceremony, planned for September.  <br>  <br>  Bernstein and Paster demanded "whatever relief is provided by law" including unspecified "compensatory damages for economic loss, humiliation, [and] mental pain."<br>  <br>  New Jersey's anti-discrimination laws currently forbid those who "offer goods, services, and facilities to the general public" from "directly or indirectly denying or withholding any accommodation, service, benefit, or privilege to an individual" on the basis of sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  However the OGCMA has stated that it must adhere to the rules of the United Methodist Book of Discipline, which forbids homosexual civil unions from being performed in churches and other areas for worship. <br>  <br>  "The facility that they requested is a facility we have used exclusively for our camp meeting mission and worship celebrations since 1869," Scott Hoffman, OGCMA's chief administrative officer told LifeSiteNews.com.<br>  <br>  The Pavilion is routinely used for worship ceremonies and gospel concerts, and used to be available for weddings until recently, Hoffman said. "Right now we're waiting for a response from the attorney general's office as what to do next."<br>  <br>  On top of that, the form Bernstein and Paster submitted in February would have also agreed to "indemnify and hold harmless" the OGCMA from claims arising from the use of the facility.<br>   <br>  Although the OGCMA had 20 days to respond to the charges, Hoffman said his group "requested another 10 days so we would be able to fully and adequately prepare our response."<br>  <br>  The group is considering all options, and contacted the Alliance Defense Fund for added legal expertise over its first amendment rights. Hoffman said his church group will attempt mediation with Bernstein and Paster to keep it out of the attorney general's office, but will not compromise.<br>  <br>  "We are most definitively a religious organization, our mission statement is to provide a place for spiritual birth, growth and renewal in a Christian seaside setting," said chief administrative officer Scott Hoffman. "We don't think that by the way the rules are written now that churches are required by any stretch of the imagination to adhere to those policies, and we don't think we are either."|`|0T3weRh5aa	Yawn...short memory<br>  <br>  The ads were paid for by the Knight of Columbus a catholic organization.

But they can't prove their -own- belief or disbelief!<br>  <br>  I believe in God, because I CHOOSE to.  But it seems to me that if God exists, it's his deliberate plan to hide from us.  He could just appear in the sky and tell us stuff, and then there would be no question.  Instead he leaves us alone, he doesn't intervene or interfere.  He lets us observe the universe and the world around us and draw  our own conclusions. He gives us the intellectual capability to learn on our own, in fact we have written language so we can accumulate knowledge from one generation to the next.  He WANTS us to figure stuff out for ourselves, and not to confuse belief, or wish, with actual knowledge.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	Because I have faith in my heart, mind, body, and soul.<br>  <br>  no other way to explain it.<br>  <br>  Have a happy day!!<br>  <br>  Cinn =)|`|NjSWQFBYaa	...Frank Morrison, a British lawyer of the 1930s, undertook an expedition to collect circumstantial evidence to disprove the resurrection. Such evidence, of course, is admissible in all courts of law in civilized countries to prove or disprove events of which there are no living eyewitnesses. When he analyzed the evidence, he reached a stunning conclusion: The resurrection had actually taken place! Morrison presented his case in his book, "Who Moved the Stone?"<br>  <br>  Another factor worth considering is the character of the disciples. They were eleven cowardly men who shut themselves in a room after the crucifixion because they were afraid. Yet what galvanized them into action so that within their own lifetime, much of the then known world could hear the message of Christ? Some of them paid for this message with their lives. Would they have done so if the resurrection were a hoax? ...|`|NFK3A68oaa	Good question.  There is plenty of evidence of an intelligent Creator in the world of living things.  <br>  <br>  For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.<br>  <br>  If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution? <br>  <br>  My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance? <br>  <br>  Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?<br>  <br>  How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"<br>  <br>  The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage). <br>  <br>  So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"<br>  <br>  All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?<br>  <br>  This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Mike|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Yes, with all my heart cuz He save me from my sins & I can go to Paradise because of His sacrifice|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	No.<br>  No evidence.<br>  And belief in anything supernatural just seems silly.|`|cByRtCC9aa	Yes, because my understanding of God makes sense to me.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	yes, because He made me and has blessed me with everything that I have.|`|N6cCc9dOaa	I believe God because I have sense.|`|QrbwYLaIaa	YES I BELIEVE IN GOD.BECAUSE I WANT TO|`|LUiiAlsJaa	i believe he was created in the mind of occultists|`|x6I3IEOBaa	cuz of the scientific miracles|`|r4cThgwdaa	nope I don't believe in any gods or goddesses|`|G19tKe43aa	Nobody knows its become more of a cult today then it was 50 years ago back then Christians were caring,nice,and well spoken and well mannered now they curse, steal, and hate everyone.

However, that is what many so-called 'Christian' religions do.  Christ himself said about them:<br>  <br>  “Many will say to me: ‘Lord, did we not prophesy, expel demons, & perform many powerful works in your name?’  Yet I will confess to them: *I never knew you! Get away from me*, you workers of lawlessness. --Matthew 7:21-23  <br>  <br>  "...Hypocrites... teach commands of men as doctrines... so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones.   Watch out!  I have forewarned You." --’”  --Mt 15:7,8; Mt 24:24,25 & Mark 13:22<br>  <br>  True Christians believe & follow Christ's teachings, so I strongly recommend finding those who actually 'follow his steps closely'.<br>  If you are seriously looking for those who strive to both teach & live according to God's Word, I highly recommend that you read one or more of the following Bible-based articles, along with the Scriptures referred to within them:<br>  <br>  Is There One True Religion?<br>   - Who Should Determine True Religion?<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/200803/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/200803/article_0...</a> <br>  <br>  Should Faith Be Based on Reason?<br>   - Search for God With Your Heart *&* Mind<br>   - Imitate the Great Teacher  <br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20020401/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20020401/article...</a> <br>  <br>  Should You Belong to a Church?<br>   - How God Dealt With People in the Past<br>   - God has long dealt with his people as an organized group.   <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article...</a><br>  <br>  Which Religion Should One Choose?<br>   -  True Christians Then and Now<br>   - The Benefits of Right Association<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20040601/article...</a><br>  <br>  Understanding the Bible--A Pleasure Open to You<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20060401a/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20060401a/articl...</a><br>  <br>  "What Does the Bible Really Teach?" <br>  (audio---listen, section by section)    <br>  <a href="http://jw.org/index.html?option=QrYQZRQVNlBBX" rel="nofollow">http://jw.org/index.html?option=QrYQZRQV...</a>  ;  <br>  (choose title from pull-down^box: "Publication")<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/publications/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/publications/ind...</a> {in print|`|bOaqWNxRaa	It doesn't matter which type or sect you choose.

It's admirable you are thinking like this but you need to know WHO you are worshiping.  That only comes from a study of the Bible first, then dedication symbolized by immersion.<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 2:3-5 says “This is fine and acceptable in the sight of our savior, God, whose will is that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH.  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus. <br>  <br>  Many people feel that since a belief is common that it must be true (i.e. The trinity, hell fire etc) but when you study you find those teachings are not in the Bible but came from somewhere else.  Many people think it doesn’t matter what religion you are as long as you have faith.  That isn’t what Jesus said.  Matt 7:14 said the road to life is very narrow and many of those rejected will call themselves Christians Matt 7:22  there’s also Ephesians 4:5 “one Lord, one faith, one baptism”<br>  <br>  So I encourage you to ask questions, study the Bible but do it with the truth.<br>  <br>  Matt 24:14 says “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses are the only ones doing this work in unity, worldwide.  <br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses have the truth.

The reason is because god has no effect on this universe. If it did, than science would be inconsistent, and because science literally means "knowledge", wouldn't exist.

We know the collapse of an accretion disk created a planet because it is the best explanation for that planet. DNA replication sustains life, abiogenesis creates life, gravity creates galaxies and clusters of galaxies, the strong force creates atoms, the weak force creates radiation, nebulae create stars, energy creates matter, evolution creates biodiversity, etc. We accept these answers because they have all been observed and are the best answers. They always create the same things, and what they always create are always created by them. All these happen over and over again with no variation. We don't know how the universe was ultimately formed, but we know what it contains was not designed, so there is more of a reason to assume it wasn't designed than to assume it was. One day we may find an answered to that. The nebula form naturally, and they naturally form stars. The star's accretion forms the planets, and the order gets more and more complex as time goes on.

Some cells have molecular “outboard motors” that propel the cells through liquid. In any other context, when such functional complexity is evident, people  conclude that these things were designed. We have no other explanation for this complexity, claims of Darwinian evolution notwithstanding.

If evidence is presented, naturally they'd become interested and it would make international headlines as scientists determine everything they can. They're in no way, however, trying to douse or widen the search for God.<br>  <br>  It's not like newer and more advanced scientific principles are coming along to try and discredit religious beliefs - that's just a byproduct, and a rather unfortunate one since people still cling to the pseudoscientific beliefs demonstrated as being wrong by professionals. I think we've lost a lot of potential intellectuals because of this, and it is one of the reasons I care about modern religion. (So quit asking, theists!)<br>  <br>  But it's important to note that credible science is not doing anything in FAVOR of religious beliefs. There has never been scientific evidence for a deity, much less a Christian deity, than there has been for any other supernatural belief. However, this could change at any time. That's the beauty of science: we don't know anything for sure, but we still do our best to figure it out.<br>  <br>  As we find out more and more about the world, the supernatural aspects become increasingly more meaningless.

Truth, from whatever source, can never be in conflict with truth, from whatever source.  Therefore true religion and true science cannot be in conflict.  Sadly however, there is much untruth among the many unauthorized manmade denominations of Protestantism.  This is obvious simply from the fact that the beliefs of each denomination conflict with the beliefs of the others, and truth cannot conflict with truth.  It is also obvious when the beliefs of certain denominations conflict with facts clearly proven by science.  However, the teachings of the original Christian Church, which have remained unchanged since they were received from Christ Himself are guaranteed true by Christ, who told the leaders of His Church and no other "whatsoever you bind upon earth is bound in heaven", and "the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth".  No surprise then that the teachings of the original Christian Church do not conflict with the findings of science.  Truth cannot conflict with truth.  Fortunately I do not have to choose between man of God and man of science because I have truth on my side in both arenas.  If you are thinking about Christianity, you owe it to yourself to look into the true Christian Church, the only one founded by Jesus Christ and the only Church approved by Him.

It existed before the Jews were formed as a nation and it existed after Israel was conquered.  God allows many things to happen in the world such as storms, famine, murder, etc.  Slavery, like divorce, is not preferred by God.  Instead, it is allowed.  Where many nations treated their slaves very badly, the Bible gave many rights and privileges to slaves.  So, even though it isn't the best way to deal with people, because God has allowed man freedom, slavery then exists.  God instructed the Israelites to treat them properly.<br>  <br>  The Bible acknowledged the slave's status as the property of the master (Ex. 21:23; Lev. 25:46). <br>  The Bible restricted the master's power over the slave. Ex. 21:20). <br>  The slave was a member of the master's household (Lev. 22:11). <br>  The slave was required to rest on the Sabbath (Exodus 20:10; Deut. 5:14). <br>  The slave was required and to participate in religious observances (Gen. 17:13; Exodus 12:44; Lev. 22:11). <br>  The Bible prohibited extradition of slaves and granted them asylum (Deut. 23:16-17). <br>  The servitude of a Hebrew debt-slave was limited to six years (Ex. 21:2; Deut. 15:12). <br>  When a slave was freed, he was to receive gifts that enabled him to survive economically (Deut. 15:14). <br>  The reality of slavery cannot be denied.  Slaves were "slave labor played a minor economic role in the ancient Near East, for privately owned slaves functioned more as domestic servants than as an agricultural or industrial labor force."|`|jdRKZe18aa	perhaps you didn't realize we live in THIS Century and THAT is Old Testament references for laws and social conditions that no longer apply to us today.|`|AA11923447	But of course, not all Christians are Biblical literalists.

Yet slavery is rampant throughout the Bible in both the Old and New Testaments. The Bible clearly approves of slavery in many passages, and it goes so far as to tell how to obtain slaves, how hard you can beat them, and when you can have sex with the female slaves.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Many Jews and Christians will try to ignore the moral problems of slavery by saying that these slaves were actually servants or indentured servants. Many translations of the Bible use the word "servant", "bondservant", or "manservant" instead of "slave" to make the Bible seem less immoral than it really is. While many slaves may have worked as household servants, that doesn't mean that they were not slaves who were bought, sold, and treated worse than livestock.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The following passage shows that slaves are clearly property to be bought and sold like livestock.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you. You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way. (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The following passage describes how the Hebrew slaves are to be treated.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom. If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him. If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master. But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God. Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl. After that, the slave will belong to his master forever. (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)<br>  <br>  Notice how they can get a male Hebrew slave to become a permanent slave by keeping his wife and children hostage until he says he wants to become a permanent slave. What kind of family values are these?<br>  <br>  The following passage describes the sickening practice of sex slavery. How can anyone think it is moral to sell your own daughter as a sex slave?<br>  <br>  When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are. If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her. And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter. If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife. If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment. (Exodus 21:7-11 NLT)<br>  <br>  So these are the Bible family values! A man can buy as many sex slaves as he wants as long as he feeds them, clothes them, and screws them!<br>  <br>  What does the Bible say about beating slaves? It says you can beat both male and female slaves with a rod so hard that as long as they don't die right away you are cleared of any wrong doing.<br>  <br>  When a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand, he shall be punished. If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property. (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)<br>  <br>  You would think that Jesus and the New Testament would have a different view of slavery, but slavery is still approved of in the New Testament, as the following passages show.<br>  <br>  Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)<br>  <br>  Christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of God and his teaching will not be shamed. If your master is a Christian, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. You should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts. Teach these truths, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. (1 Timothy 6:1-2 NLT)<br>  <br>      The servant will be severely punished, for though he knew his duty, he refused to do it.  "But people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly.  Much is required from those to whom much is given, and much more is required from those to whom much more is given."  (Luke 12:47-48 NLT)|`|uAMzmAwaaa	as we are also to "follow the law of the land" it is not okay in most places in the world. however it should be noted that if you look at ancient slavery in Israel compared to the slavery in America the slavery done by following in the Bible was a walk in the park...

Behold! a woman of 'Imran (the wife of ‘Imran) said: "O my Lord! I do dedicate unto Thee what is in my womb for Thy special service: So accept this of me: For Thou hearest and knowest all things." When she was delivered, she said: "O my Lord! Behold! I am delivered of a female child!"- and Allah knew best what she brought forth- "And no wise is the male Like the female. I have named her Mary, and I commend her and her offspring to Thy protection from the Evil One, the Rejected."  Right graciously did her Lord accept her: He made her grow in purity and beauty: To the care of Zechariah was she assigned. Every time that he entered (Her) chamber to see her, He found her supplied with sustenance. He said: "O Mary! Whence (comes) this to you?" She said: "From Allah. for Allah Provides sustenance to whom He pleases without measure." 38. There did Zechariah) pray to his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant unto me from Thee a progeny that is pure: for Thou art He that heareth prayer! 39. While he was standing in prayer in the chamber, the angels called unto him: "(Allah) doth give thee glad tidings of John, witnessing the truth of a Word from Allah, and (be besides) noble, chaste, and a prophet,- of the (goodly) company of the righteous." 40. He said: "O my lord! How shall I have a son seeing I am very old and my wife is barren?" "Thus" was the answer "doth Allah accomplish what He willeth." 41. He said: "O my Lord! Give me a Sign!" "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three days but with signals. Then celebrate the praises of thy Lord again and again, and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning." 42. Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee- chosen thee above the women of all nations. 43. "O Mary! worship Thy Lord devoutly: Prostrate thyself, and bow down (in prayer) with those who bow down." 44. This is part of the tidings of the things unseen, which We reveal unto thee (O Messenger.) by inspiration: Thou wast not with them when they cast lots with arrows, as to which of them should be charged with the care of Mary: Nor wast thou with them when they disputed (the point). 45. Behold! the angels said: "O Mary! Allah giveth thee glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, held in honour in this world and the Hereafter and of (the company of) those nearest to Allah. 46. "He shall speak to the people in childhood and in maturity. And he shall be (of the company) of the righteous." 47. She said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man hath touched me?" He said: "Even so: Allah createth what He willeth: When He hath decreed a plan, He but saith to it, 'Be,' and it is! 48. "And Allah will teach him the Book and Wisdom, the Law and the Gospel, 49. "And (appoint him) an apostle to the Children of Israel, (with this message): "'I have come to you, with a Sign from your Lord, in that I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah.s leave: And I heal those born blind, and the lepers, and I quicken the dead, by Allah.s leave; and I declare to you what ye eat, and what ye store in your houses. Surely therein is a Sign for you if ye did believe; 50. "'(I have come to you), to attest the Law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was (Before) forbidden to you; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord. So fear Allah, and obey me. 51. "'It is Allah Who is my Lord and your Lord; then worship Him. This is a Way that is straight.'" 52. When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: "Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah." Said the disciples: "We are Allah.s helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims. 53. "Our Lord! we believe in what Thou hast revealed, and we follow the Messenger. then write us down among those who bear witness." 54. And (the unbelievers) plotted and planned, and Allah too planned, and the best of planners is Allah. 55. Behold! Allah said: "O Jesus! I will take thee and raise thee to Myself and clear thee (of the falsehoods) of those who blaspheme; I will make those who follow thee superior to those who reject faith, to the Day of Resurrection: Then shall ye all return unto me, and I will judge between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.Surah 19:16.

You need to remember that Pentecostals don't think WE are the ones healing people. We know that we are just the "middle man". God does the healing if it is in His will.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Actually the latest article I read today about Jade Goody is that she is glad to be married and now she is 'ready to go to heaven'.  That sounds to me like one very content girl!  A clearly very inwardly beautiful girl who has humbly accepted that her time on this earth is coming to an end.<br>  <br>  Living in the UK and being bombarded by news articles about this lady every day, there is nothing so far that I have read to suggest in ANY way that this young woman is bitter or angry towards God.  And one reporter noted a bible by her bedside.<br>  <br>  The sense of peace that Jade has is almost enviable, and also her humility.....she has only reached this place, I believe, by the grace of God.  If she is NOT angry and bitter towards God, please let us not be also.<br>  <br>  Yes it is heartbreaking that one so young should be dying and leaving behind two young boys.  We cannot question why God has allowed this...we must remember he is a not a slot-machine God or a wishing-well God, neither is He a magician....He is a loving saviour who, I believe, will welcome this humble girl into his Kingdom......|`|1gTZhGH1aa	There is not one Christian who does not believe in the power of prayer. No human heals anyone. God may do this through a human. But never in order to encourage a sin. "Do not put the Lord your God to the test". Your question sounds a bit like Satan tempting Jesus. God is not slave to mankind. And I am certain many are praying for Jade Goodie. Would her being healed via miracle convert many? You tell me. She would probably be accused of publicity stunt. It convering her and her family would be enough. But we have proofs. People have been cured miraculously all of the world, has the converted the world? No. It has converted some. We were put on this earth to sanctfy ourselves, we were made to be in God's own image. Jesus is that image. And while God created us without us, He will not sanctify us without us, without our co-operation with grace. And time? Time does not belong to us either. We have free will on how we use it. But the Bible tells us to be always ready for when the Bridegroom comes. This is not just generally, with Christ returning. But individually, because no one knows when our time has run out. If death is like a sleep, just no waking up then there is nothing to fear. But, if death means a hell, which is an everlasting second death, there is plenty to fear. God did not leave us with no proofs that He is. And, for those who pray, they have to remember that God is in charge here, not us, they have to also ask if they themselves are doing what God asks. I would ask everyone pray for Jade, but for the right reasons, and if it is not God's will that she remain on this earth, then let us pray for her conversion, that she will receive mercy. The is the greatest kind of miracle there is, and much more valuable than mortal life, for it attains to an eternal life with God. Every one at some point will be where Jade is now, and when praying for her, make sure it is for the right reasons. Not in order to test God and place yourself in mortal sin which is separation from God.|`|YQk9Z3LMaa	There are a lot of people dying in tragic circumstances not just Jade.  No-one knows why this young woman's time on planet earth is now soon to come to an end but if you were to read any newspaper/magazine articles about this girl you will notice how gracious and humble she is, without any seeming bitterness or resentment.<br>  <br>  We cant say to God "Heal this girl or we wont believe in you" or "Heal this girl and then we will believe in you"- that is childish and almost pathetic.  Jade appears to have a remarkable peace about her, which most of us could only envy about her, especially with all the heartache pain and suffering she is enduring.....|`|cMhq2tYwaa	I'm a Christian. I have depression.<br>  Does that mean that God doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  We have no right to say to God "heal this person, or we'll stop believing in you", because He is God. He is all-powerful, all-knowing. He does not have to do everything we ask - we are HIS servants, He isn't ours.<br>  <br>  I have prayed many times for my depression to go, yet it hasn't. Does that mean that God doesn't exist, or just that I'm going through this for my own benefit? And there certainly is benefit in this illness, I've experienced it already.<br>  I have faith that when the time is right for me to be healed of depression, I will be. If I'm to have this illness for the rest of my life, I'm very, VERY thankful for the benefits it brings.<br>  <br>  I personally think the same goes for other people, too. So they become ill - so what? Look at the good that comes out of it.<br>  <br>  Why does God have to prove Himself to you? He's not a little dog that wants to please you all the time.

AA11709238	1. The Sirens were creatures composed of the body parts of women and birds. They were said to lure sailors to their deaths by their beautiful voices and enticing songs.<br>  <br>  4. There were several dangers that Odysseus had to face. The cylopes Polyphemus, the Laestrygonians, a journey to Hades, the Sirens, and Scylla and Charybdis, just to name a few.<br>  <br>  9. The lesser of the two evils between Scylla and Charybdis? Scylla is the lesser of the two evils. Odysseus takes this path, unarmed, because to sail close to Charybdis (a whirlpool) would mean the deaths of him and all of his shipmates, whereas sailing closer to Scylla would only risk six lives.<br>  <br>  11. After escaping Scylla, Odysseus was informed that he would arrive at Thrinacia, the island of Helios' sacred cattle. Circe wishes that Odysseus would pass by Thrinacia altogether, but advises Odysseus to leave Helios' cattle unharmed if he wished to return home to Ithaca. To harm the cattle would equal a sure death, and even if Odysseus alone were to survive, his remaining journey would be long and hard.<br>  <br>  20. Odysseus must pass by Scylla quickly and unarmed or risk losing more men.<br>  <br>  21. Eurylochus speaks up and tells Odysseus that his men are tired, hungry and still mourning the losses of their lost comrades.<br>  <br>  22. Eurylochus convinces the men to eat the cattle by arguing that it would be better to die with a fully belly than to die of hunger.If they reached Ithaca, he assured the men, they would build a temple for Helios and give him sacrifices.<br>  <br>  26. Zeus let loose a violent storm and destroyed the ship with his thunderbolt. Only Odysseus survived.<br>  <br>  31. Odysseus managed to pass by both Scylla and Charybdis alive and unscathed by clinging to a tree.<br>  <br>  33. After leaving Calypso's island of Ogygia and before arriving at Scheria, the home of King Alcinous, Poseidon sends forth a storm to further punish Odysseus, destroying his raft. He is saved by Ino.<br>  <br>  34. Athena meets up with Odysseus face-to-face while he is on his way to the palace of King Alcinous. She is in the guise of a young maiden.<br>  <br>  35. Athena gives Odysseus advice on several occasions. As the previous question involved Odysseus' arrival at Scheria, I'm going to assume that you're asking for the advice that Athena gives Odysseus regarding Scheria and the king and queen of the Phaeacians. Athena advises Odysseus to win the favor of Queen Arete, that to win her good graces would increase his chances of returning home.|`|z06Tkobjaa	I know a few:<br>  <br>  20: Odysseus travels over scylla because charybdis would destroy their boat, scylla would just eat alot of people.<br>  1: The Sirens are demigods(?) that were blessed with singing voice, they were stationed at rocks and would draw in men, who would get sunk by jagged rocks, and the men eaten by sharks.<br>  9: lesser of the two evils is Scylla

pt6wIlS1aa	Has your supervisor explained why s/he keeps refusing to let you try out your ideas? Have you come up with responses to those reasons or concerns? If not, you might start by asking for a short meeting to go over them. Before the meeting, try to think what the risks would be and how to minimize or mitigate them, so you have answers to your supervisor's arguments.<br>  <br>  If you've been told the reasons for not moving on your ideas, but you haven't answered them, you could do this by writing up a proposal. In the proposal, state the current way things are done, your suggestions, the advantages of your way, and have a section on risk analysis covering the boss's objections and your responses. You could submit it to just your supervisor or you could cc the director as well. You could even cc the team, if you wanted, to make it look like an open communication. That way, you're not going behind the supervisor's back, you're just including the director in the loop. By addressing it to your supervisor, you're not going over his/her head - not openly, at least. In a subtle way, you're making sure the director will see it and giving him/her a chance to push for it if s.he likes the ideas. You can also follow up and ask his/her opinion directly, "just to get another perspective."<br>  <br>  If you think this will lead to a problem with your supervisor, then your only real option is to request a private meeting with the director and say flat out that you don't want to step on toes, but you're being repeatedly shot down and feel your ideas are good enough and important enough to see the director about. Even if you end up doing this, presenting them in written form is a good idea.|`|ExaerfDraa	Respect authority and do as your supervisor says.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	watch the movie "working girl"|`|ZYJ1I9ZNaa	s.h.i.t if you find out let me know...my supervisor's a ***** and swears she knows everything|`|hXQnR2Scaa	There is no way to do this and not step on toes.<br>  And, unless your director is knocked dead by your ideas (and somehow ignores the fact that you went around your boss), you are headed for big trouble.<br>  <br>  You might very well win your point, but your boss is never going to forget this. In fact, it will be WORSE if your ideas are good, because that will reflect poorly on your boss.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, what happens if the director thinks the same thing you boss does of your ideas?<br>  <br>  I advise you to keep your mouth shut, unless this is important enough to risk losing your job over. And believe me when I tell you - that risk is very real in this situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	You can tell the director your reasons for coming to him instead of your supervisor.  You can ask the director to keep it quiet that you went over the supervisor's head.  The director should really know that the supervisor isn't doing a very good job, plus your ideas deserve to be hears.

In chapter 14 Jesus explicitly states that he knows he will be betrayed to the authorities. Given that Judas was actually at the table, Jesus could have very simply either fled, or had Judas held so he could not betray Jesus later that night. In verse 62 Jesus even admits to being the son of God, knowing that such a claim was blasphemy in the eyes of the authorities holding him. Making such an explicit claim was sure to gain him the death sentence.<br>     Finally, if one believes Jesus came in order to die in order to "save mankind", then you have to believe Jesus wanted to die. Or at least he felt he had to, and that every action he took was premeditated into ensuring that he committed 'suicide by cop".|`|GdXOjRNmaa	After the last supper & Jesus went to the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed to God the father saying "Abba, Father,all things are possible for You.

7rD3uJzdaa	Why don't you talk to your commanding officer and see if there is some way you could possibly go home for just that one day or if it is a week-end see if you could go on shore leave for the week-end? If he says yes than you go home and surprise her? Hope my answer was helpful?|`|zviDShi6aa	Traditionally, the first anniversary is paper. Maybe you could work on a little comic book-type thing telling a story about how you met or why you fell in love then get it professionally printed up at Kinkos or someplace like that. Even if you're not really artistically inclined, it would make a nice companion gift to go along with flowers or something. <br>  <br>  There's also scrapbooks--instead of drawing you could take pictures of things that you've done together and arrange to have it printed and shipped on the day of your anniversary. It would take a little extra work just before you leave, but it'd be worth it. Most photography places make it really easy--you just select the pictures and they have it already laid out to look nice. you could even see if they'll put captions or a little story in there. <br>  Here's some other, non-paper ideas:<br>  <br>  -if she's a homebody, arrange to have her stay home that night and pre pay to have her favorite meal delivered in, maybe with a note.<br>  -hide a bunch of small presents in your house and mail her a map to the locations; have the map delivered on the day of your anniversary by a friend of hers or yours. ( guess that's still paper, kinda)<br>  -if you think going out with her friends might cheer her up more and you're up for it, treat her and one of her girl friends to a night out--dinner and a movie, maybe some drinks or whatever she likes to do. arrange it with the friend and restaurant beforehand.<br>  -some pizza places will make a pizza with the topping spelling out "WILL U MARRY ME?" I dont' see why they can't do "I MISS YOU."<br>  That'd be better in addition to some sort of jewelry or flowers, but still. it'd be cute.<br>  <br>  I'll edit this if I think of anything else! If all else fails, just remember, flowers.com and most local florists will deliver on the day of and take orders far in advance. many big cities also have courier services that will pick up an item that's been paid for and deliver it the day of, too, so that leaves jewelry, clothing, books, practically anything open.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u7ENwYnSaa	women like romantic gifts and if you guys are still newlyweds you can be extra romantic.

AA6Aq94vaa	Speak to your local rabbi<br>   Usually, you need to study Judaism for a few years before you are allowed to convert<br>  <br>   Judaism only accepts serious converts|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	Please do a bit of reading about Judaism before you make this decision.  There are very good websites such as <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org</a> or <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org</a> that can help you.  It is not a simple thing to convert to Judaism.  You first have to decide if you want to do an Orthodox, Conservative or Reform conversion.  So you need to know about the differences between those branches of Judaism and than decide which one you believe will suit you.  After that, you should look for a synagogue and talk to the Rabbi about your desire to convert.  Some Rabbis (mostly Orthodox, I believe) might turn you away and tell you to go home and think about it.  They might even do that more than once.  The reason being that they want to be sure that this is truly what you want to do and need to do.  When you convert to Judaism, not only are you taking on a new religion, you are also taking on a "family" and a "tribe."  That's more of a responsibility and we want to be sure that you accept that responsibility.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Shalom!|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Here's how to defect from the Catholic Church:<br>  <a href="http://clsa.org/content/files/USCCB_memo_2006_0405.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://clsa.org/content/files/USCCB_memo...</a>|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Just reject the Messiah and start waiting for Him Who has already come.|`|f1ycXGuHaa	Don't.

2PZnXjZ7aa	most of it is just the person being paranoid.The number 13 is probably the most common of all superstitions, considered a bad luck day.<br>  <br>  Here's a bit of information from wikipedia: Friday the 13th is considered a day of bad luck in English-, French- and Portuguese-speaking countries around the world, as well as in Austria, Germany, Estonia, Finland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Republic of Ireland, Poland, Bulgaria, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, and the Philippines.<br>  <br>  Similar superstitions exist in some other traditions. In Greece, Romania and Spanish-speaking countries, for example, it is Tuesday the 13th that is considered unlucky. In Italy, it is Friday the 17th.<br>  <br>  The fear of Friday the 13th is called paraskavedekatriaphobia,[1] a word derived from the concatenation of the Greek words Paraskeví (Παρασκευ?) (meaning Friday), and dekatreís (δεκατρε??) (meaning thirteen), attached to phobía (φοβ?α) (meaning fear). The term is a specialized form of triskaidekaphobia, a simple phobia (fear) of the number thirteen appearing in any case<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  wikipedia dot com<br>  crystalinks dot com<br>  (:|`|EWR01atlaa	IDK i guess it's because of the movie ''Friday the 13th'' which is a scary blah movie. Anyways. and so everyone thinks Jason or something will come on that day. Or they think something bad will happen.

But i think it's just everyone's imagination.|`|jp3WrE1caa	idk,but if things do happen,its because people think something bad will happen,so they freak out and end up causing them.FACT: there are more car accidents on friday the 13th then any other day.why?because people think something bad will happen to them,so theyre so worried and not paying attention to the road,they get in car crashes|`|h1eBWehMaa	look it up on wikipedia, there is alot of info there on Friday 13th|`|E7AyPQkDaa	friday the 13th was my birthday so its not unlucky.|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Okay, bad things happen and 13 is an odd number, that's why it isn't as great as fifteen or twenty.|`|r7scOGSqaa	the superstition is derived from myths about both Fridays and the number 13. <br>  Fridays were considered bad and generally it was never a good idea to plan something on that day -a job interview,marriage or date because it would end in diaster, like the marriage would fall apart you didnt get the job or you did but get fired ect-<br>  <br>  Fridays, for example, are hailed as a particularly significant day in the Christian tradition. Obviously, there is Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ was crucified. But according to Christian lore, Adam and Eve also supposedly ate the forbidden fruit on a Friday, the Great Flood started on a Friday, the builders of the Tower of Babel were tongue-tied on a Friday and the Temple of Solomon was destroyed on a Friday. Of course, the Bible doesn't specifically note many these events occurring on Fridays, and some of the tradition may have stemmed from the fact that pre-Christian pagan cultures hailed Friday as holy days. Fridays in the early Norse culture were associated with love and considered a good day for weddings. The word "Friday" is, in fact, derived from a Norse deity who was worshipped on the sixth day of the week and who represented marriage and fertility. <br>  <br>  Over time, however, mythology transformed the Norse fertility goddess into a witch, and Fridays became an unholy Sabbath. Incidentally, the goddess' sacred animal was a feline, which may explain the legendary connection between witches and cats, as well as the superstition about black cats heralding bad luck. <br>  <br>  In addition to the legendary significance of Fridays, the sixth day of the week also was execution day in ancient Roman times and later Hangman's Day in Britain<br>  <br>  The number 13 was considered bad for different reasons. One of them was 12 was considered even, divine, spiritual -there were 12 diciples *sp* for Jesus- but to go over it -13- was considered odd, evil and terrrible -the Last Supper in Christian tradition hosted 13 people and one of them betrayed Christ, resulting in the crucifixion- <br>  Both the Vikings and Hindus reportedly had a myth in which 12 of the gods were invited to a gathering and Loki, the god of mischief, crashed the party and incited a riot. Tradition in both cultures holds that 13 people at a dinner party is bad luck and will end in the death of the party attendees. <br>  The number 13 also has been associated with death in other cultures. The ancient Egyptians, for example, believed life unfolded in 12 stages, and the 13th stage was death. The Egyptians considered death a part of their ultimate journey and looked forward to the spiritual transformation.The number 13 may have an unlucky connotation because of its association with the lunar calendar (there are 13 lunar cycles in a year) and with femininity (women have 13 menstrual cycles in a year). <br>  It was on Friday, Oct. 13, 1307, that France's King Philip IV had the Knights Templar rounded up for torture and execution. The Knights Templar were an order of warriors within the Roman Catholic Church who banded together to protect Christian travellers visiting Jerusalem in the centuries after the Crusades. The Knights eventually became a rich, powerful and allegedly corrupt order within the church and were executed for heresy. <br>  <br>  The date may be forever cursed by one event that occurred nearly 700 years ago, or by a series of cosmic coincidences. <br>  <br>  Or it may be a figment of human beings' collective imaginations...

If your sister is there with you, and is helping you then you shouldn't worry, everyones with you and nothing bad is going to happen. People with large tumors on their stomachs are in way way way worse positions. All the doctors will make sure the entire process will go perfectly, and they will make sure your okay througout it.

You need to decide how you feel.  <br>  <br>  I can make you feel less scared about the operation, though.  I had a cesarean section. That's when you have a baby through an incision in your abdomen instead of the "normal" way.  I wanted to see my baby be born, so I opted to stay awake.  I had a special anesthesia which was given through a needle in my back.  It only hurt for a second, when they put the needle in, and then I couldn't feel a thing.  All I could feel was slight pressure when they were cutting, and slight tugging when they pulled the baby out.  <br>  <br>  So you can be awake for an operation, and not feel any pain.  I hope this helps you to be a little less scared.  <br>  <br>  I also hope that you find your decision easy, because then you'll know for sure that you made the right decision.  Remember, it has to be your decision, not anyone else's.  You have to be true to yourself to be happy in the future.<br>  <br>  Children, while an issue, shouldn't be the only deciding factor, as adoption is always an option, and when a child needs you... it doesn't matter whether it's yours or not, you'll love it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!

Go to a concert from Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, or any of Psychopathic Records. You can meet a lot of Homies that way.<br>     3. Ignore criticism. If you are a member of the Juggalo family, those who hate you do not matter.<br>     4. If nothing else, learn to appreciate yourself and appreciate everyone for who they are and just enjoy life. That's what the Juggalo family is about.<br>     5. If you listen to ICP and you don't get a weird feeling in your stomach, like an euphoric you can't explain (Juggalos can feel it inside when they talk about the Dark Carnival or the 6 joker's cards) then you can be an ICP fan, but not a Juggalo.<br>     6. Never lie about being a juggalo.<br>     7. Sidenote: #5 Can be contradicted by this article: Juggalo Wiki Article.<br>     8. As explained in the article: "a press release from Insane Clown Posse, they say "there are no requirements to being a Juggalo. We don't care if you spend a dime on merch, or if you know the words to every song. If this music touches you, and you get some positive experience from it, we would be honored to have you consider yourself a Juggalo." In a 2005 interview, Joseph Utsler explained, "you could be a Juggalo and not even listen to ICP. A Juggalo is a frame of mind and what not. And I was a Juggalo before we started with ICP. [...] You don't even to have to fuckin' necessarily listen to [Psychopathic Records] to be a Juggalo. Juggalos are Juggalos."<br>  <br>  Tip:<br>      * Painting your face is an optional part of the lifestyle. If you do so, take the time to apply the paint correctly.<br>      * Listen to your own feelings on whether you believe you are a Juggalo.<br>      * Go to your local mall and kick there for a grip - you're bound to see some juggalos there! Though, not a lot of them are mainstream, so just keep an eye out and say what up when you see a member of the fam. If they're really down, they'll say hey back.<br>      * understand what the Dark Carnival is and what it means to be a Juggalo. If you think you know but aren't really sure, ask somebody!<br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings: <br>      * Don't try too hard.

The translation is disputed. Following the King James Version, many Bibles render the passage "there too the night creature" or "the screech owl also shall rest there".

I just read an editorial saying how it isn't a "victimless" thing because the money goes to the violence in Mexico.  What a crock.  True, but only because a user can get busted for growing a few plants for personal use.  40 years ago we were laughing at a film called Reefer Madness (Tell Your Children).  It's insane.  This is a simple weed one can grow under almost any conditions and it isn't going to go away.  As far as I can tell, great $hitloads of money are being spent in order to force more $hitloads of money into the hands of violent criminals.  That's what the war against pot, after 70+ years, has all come down to.  It's true that potheads don't accomplish much, but they don't cause much trouble either.  We don't have to tax it in order to realize an economic benefit; all we have to do is decriminalize it.<br>  <br>  I heard on the radio this morning that Kellogg has lost more over the Phelps flap than it did over the peanut salmonella issue.

I was seriously considering agreeing with you about growing INDUSTRIAL hemp but there at the end, the true reason you want the so called industrial hemp legalized is for legalized pot.

You can't get stoned from hemp, hemp has been used for cattle feed, as well as the products you mentioned - most commonly in rope.<br>  <br>  Hemp used to be an american product - farmers in the early americas grew cotton, hemp, rice, wheat, tobacco, etc - it just became cheaper to get these products from overseas in many cases later on.  American farmers STILL grow industrial hemp in a LOT of places.<br>  <br>  Growing hemp, however, is NOT going to take steps towards legalizing marijuana, because they are NOT the same thing.<br>  <br>  Get your propagandas right, learn the history of hemp in the U.S. - seriously.|`|VSDaQ9QOaa	I agree with you completely.  Smoking weed is the choice the responsible and compassionate person makes instead of alchohol which causes people to black out where they don't even know what<br>  they've done - people on alchohol murder their spouses and children,<br>  run down innocent people with their cars on the highway, cause untold dollars in property damage, fight with their neighbors, act in an unacceptable and inappropriate manner, neglect and/or abuse their<br>  children and put their family and friends into dangerous situations.<br>  <br>  Weed doesn't cause or do any of those things.  There is absolutely<br>  no reason that it should be illegal except that the Counties make loads of money on fines & court costs and probation fees.  Now with<br>  the current economic situation, you will see more and more States<br>  giving thought to legalizing weed because they can regulate AND TAX IT.  Gee, all of a sudden its not quite as dangerous as they once thought....wow what a revelation....funny what the almighty dollar will<br>  do when it speaks, ya know?<br>  <br>  I was always amazed that it would be legal for a person to slop down<br>  so much Jack Daniels that he is a walking time-bomb and yet to smoke weed means getting thrown in the pokey.  Makes no sense<br>  to me.  I don't think the Government realizes just how many people<br>  smoke weed in this Country -  those of us who were at Woodstock are<br>  now in our late 50's, 60's and 70's and all smoked or now smoke it,<br>  and so do a large majority of young people.  This is something that<br>  has crossed over an entire line to the next generation.  <br>  <br>  I SAY LEGALIZE IT AND ALSO USE IT TO MAKE THE MANY<br>  WONDERFUL PRODUCTS THAT COME FROM HEMP.

mVTGl6HGaa	The Jus de non evocando is an ancient feudal right, stating that no one can be kept from the competent court. It derives from a medieval principle that subjects of the Crown were entitled to ius de non evocando, the right to enjoy the jurisdiction and protection of the Crown to which they were loyal. As such it is still present in several constitutions, such as the German constitution, the Italian constitution and the Dutch constitution.<br>  <br>  It has today become an important concept in public international law by which states refuse to extradite their own citizens. Some countries may refuse to extradite non-nationals, who, because of their crimes, may be subject to the death penalty. This may be seen in the case of Canada and Mexico vis-à-vis the United States.<br>  <br>  This principle is frequently argued in cases of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The foundation lies in that the international tribunal, by seizing jurisdiction over an international criminal trial from national courts, is violating the principle of jus de non evocando. The Trial Chamber in the case of Dusko Tadic (IT-94-1 of the ICTY) stated that states give up some measure of sovereignty to be a part of the UN and the ICTY is a product of the UN, therefore there is no violation.

gP11453Waa	Hi, this is an interesting question.  Indeed, yours is a rare name, there being but a handful spelled as your name is spelled and only 15 spelled Yelixa.  It can also be spelled Yelixza.    <br>  <br>    If you will search just for the name under the various spellings (and there are probably more variants than I have listed), you will find some people who share your name in several of its spellings.  Some are in social networking sites.<br>  <br>          I disagree with one answerer that yours is "just another made-up name."   However, I have not yet found its origins.  Keep watching here, though, for I welcome the opportunity to contribute to solving your mystery.  Names are really special, whether we know their origins or not, but when we can add that information it helps us to understand our heritage a bit better.  Sometimes a simple little thing like the history of a name can open some important genealogical doors. <br>  <br>            Hang in there, for if the answer can be found, we shall find it!  Oh, and you get a star for this great question.  Regardless of what aksuited29 says, yours is not a stupid question.  I suspect that answerer doesn't put a lot of effort into learning people things.  In fact, the URL he gave does not exist as a valid site; perhaps it was his attempt at sarcasm.  <br>  <br>          Be proud of your name, and make your name proud of you.<br>  <br>  Here is one link giving some statistics on one spelling of the name.

Thanks.<br>  <br>  PROGRESS!  In a forum where someone was seeking the meaning of the name spelled Yelixza, there were some possible answers.  It might well be of Mayan origin and mean waking to the life.   It could also be of Venezuelan origin and refer to a princess whose name means door near or to the sky.  A third possibility is that it may mean one who can or is encouraged to change laws (a princess might be able to do that).

The Christians changed it into Sun-day to honor Saint Constantine's favorite day off! <br>  <br>  The first victim of "breaking the Sabbath" Commandment was a poor guy who went out into the Arabian desert to find some sticks to build a fire! He was arrested and put in jail. God found out about it right away and ordered Moses to have the guy stoned to death ON THE SPOT! This comes as another afterthought because God forgot to tell everybody what happens with anybody breaking the Sabbath Law so they can honestly figure the risk of doing anything to keep alive! You have to be a sadistically oriented religious person of the Westboro class to love this barbaric God!<br>  <br>  Numbers 15:32-36 (Infllible King James Version) And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation* (*The Gestapo Holy Police and the “whole assembly” can work on the Sabbath, but not so the laity!). And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones* (*the bastards didn’t wait until Monday or for some appeal if any so they killed him without any mercy right on the Sabbath day for God’s own pleasure!), and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses* (*FYI… That shows how much God loves the people that he created! No pedophile was ever stoned in the Bible stories and there were plenty of them! God the Holy Ghost is the foremost child abuser in the Bible stories and he is getting off the hook, spiritually speaking, of course!) <br>  <br>  This story shows the barbaric sense of “Divine Justice” of the Bible writers. Christians improved considerably thanks to rational secularism proving that we evolve at least intellectually. A lot of Christians are becoming more liberal all the time especially in America! America dictates the Christian rule in the “Protestant” world while the Catholic Clergy feels safe to minister the “needs” of the Catholics mostly in the 3rd and 4th World countries!|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	u can simply go and grow a brain and a backbone, so u wont need him anymore|`|AA10471892	There is no set day.

Constantine's change was accepted by the Papal Church and as the Papacy grew in power, it opposed Sabbath observance in favor of Sunday sacredness and made the day change official in the Council of Laodicea in 336. <br>  ______________________________________<br>  <br>  People give the reason that they honor Sunday now as the Sabbath instead of Saturday because Christ rose on Sunday. God NEVER said to do this. <br>  <br>  People also interpret scripture incorrectly, they think the apostles kept Sunday as the Sabbath but they didn't.... <br>  <br>  In Acts it mentions people had gotten together one Sunday with Paul to pray and worship. However, it didn't say anything about the Sabbath being changed. They just gathered together because Paul was leaving the following day. <br>  <br>  In Corinthians where it said to lay some money aside on the first day of the week, has nothing to do with tithing. If you read the entire section and in Romans it says why they did this...Paul wanted everything to be collected already before he showed up, so he wouldn't have to wait for them to do it while he was there. The collection went to those in Jerusalem because there was a financial need at the time, we know they supported a large number of widows (Acts 6:1-6) and were in the midst of famine (Acts 11:27-30). <br>  <br>  Another scripture that has been misinterpreted is in Colossians - So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ... but what they don't understand is that there are TWO sabbaths. One is the weekly Sabbath that God sanctified and made holy AT CREATION (Genesis 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy) before there were even any Jews, which was just repeated in the 10 commandments. The other are ceremonial annual sabbaths (Feast of Unleavened Bread, Feast of Weeks, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles). The ceremonial laws were done away with when Christ died, not God's Holy laws. <br>  <br>  Saturday, not Sunday is the Sabbath. God never changed it. He said remember the Seventh Day Sabbath and keep it holy. We should obey God, and not follow after the traditions of men.|`|0YQRbq9faa	Saturday is the sabbath for the Jews.  Keeping the Sabbath is one of the 10 commandments (Exodus 20:8)<br>  <br>  Sunday is the Lord's day commemorating the day Jesus rose from the tomb (Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:2, Mark 16:9, Luke 24:1, John 20:1, John 20:19). The phrase, "first day of the week" in these verses means on Sunday, the first day of the week.|`|pSNSlRlRaa	The Jewish Sabbath, the last day of the week, pictured the real 1,000 year Sabbath, of which Jesus is Lord. <br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:1 For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things,..<br>  <br>  So, now, in the Christian world, we are in the 1,000 year Sabbath of God, and all who do not continually keep themselves holy will be removed. (Revelation 22:14,15)<br>  <br>  Matthew 12:8 For Lord of the Sabbath is what the Son of man is.<br>  <br>  Revelation 20:4-6.. but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him (Jesus) for the thousand years.|`|bsyeJmqIaa	I worship God EVERYDAY.

He used to do a demonstration of his "mediumship" where he was supposedly put into a trance, fastened to a chair, the lights were switched off, and a luminous 'spiriti trumpet' would move round the room, supposedly controlled by spirits......but one day the lights were switched on unexpectedly, catching Lincoln/Fry red handed out of the chair dancing round the room with trumpet in hand....fraudster!<br>  <br>  You can google it for the full story.  <br>  <br>  <br>  There's no 'gift'.  It's all trickery.  You just need to learn cold reading techniques then you too can be a pretend 'psychic' like Lincoln/Fry.<br>  <br>  Derren Brown and James Randi can tell you all you need to know about the trickery of being a 'medium'.<br>  <br>  <br>  Watch some idiot come along and try to tell you that although all TV mediums have been shown to be fakes and fraudsters, there are still some genuine ones.....Wake Up and smell the coffee....their are no genuine ones, they're all fraudsters!!!|`|ccFIoqkNaa	you don't have to be born with it, go to your local spiritualist church and ask them about it and if they can give you any advice and help on it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your journey :)|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	You begin as a LARGE and then you go on a strict diet.|`|BNHocZaiaa	Don't eat so much.  You'll lose weight.|`|iZrNlSIJaa	You don't have to be born with the gift, although it does come easier to some than others. However, some people can do it naturally (without having to be taught), but those people are rare. <br>  <br>  I compare mediumship and other psychic abilities to playing a musical instrument. Everybody can learn to read music, but some people become better at playing the instrument than others. Also, like playing an instrument, you need to practice in order to become good at it. In other words, everyone has it in them to learn. See what I mean?   <br>  <br>  I would recommend that you start with a protection ritual of some sort to protect yourself from any negative entities. Then you need to start meditation in a quite, protected spot where you know you won't be disturbed. When you are comfortable in meditation ask if there are any friendly spirits that are willing to communicate with you. State again that negative entities are not welcome. This is just what works for me. But remember that different people have different methods of doing this. Hope I've helped.<br>  <br>  btw, don't let the "it's a demon" types frighten you. They only say that because they have no idea.<br>  <br>  edit: Colin Fry is a fraud, just like John Edward, and probably Sylvia Browne, too. Edgar Cayce was the real deal, though.

iHDYncuXaa	I'm not going to go through this whole list, however, I will give you an example how these can be misconstrued as being contradictory. You are literally taking two completely different things and twisting them as in Genesis 1:31 and 6:6. God's work is good (Gen 1:31) vs. sin, which is the devil's work, is bad (Gen 6:6). How hard can that be to interpret?|`|Zgs4RncIaa	With Genesis 1:31 & 6:6<br>  <br>  If you want to quote the Books, Chapters, and Verses do it in it's entirety, NOT just what you want to pick out.<br>  <br>  If you read both of these books, chapters, verses in the entirety you will know they are not contradicting each other.<br>  <br>  But I will continue reading on with what you say are contradicting verses.<br>  <br>  As far as the dwelling goes, God dwells EVERYWHERE and ANYWHERE he wants to dwell. <br>  <br>  Ok i'm done looking up your "contradicting" verses.

When you pluck little excerpts from here and there you can make any book say what you want it to say.<br>  I will tackle one that jumped out at me.  Heb 6:18 does not say what you quoted. (I have to include v 17 as well because of punctuation) rather it reads as follows:  Thus, God determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.<br>  v19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul;, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil..."<br>  this is an "exhortation to maturity".<br>  Show me where any of that say God can lie by proxy? and He send forth lying Spirits?

God dwells in chosen temples<br>  2 Chron 7:12,16<br>  God dwells not in temples<br>  Acts 7:48<br>  <br>  I read 2 Chronicles 7:12 & 16. God didn't say he dwelled in temples. Here is what they say:<br>  2 Chronicles 7:12  the LORD appeared to him at night and said: "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.<br>  <br>  2 Chronicles 7:16  I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.<br>  <br>  So...I don't get it.<br>  <br>  3. God dwells in light<br>  Tim 6:16<br>  God dwells in darkness<br>  1 Kings 8:12/ Ps 18:11/ Ps 97:2<br>  <br>  God is omnipresent. He is everywhere. He is in temples, but temples do not contain Him.

I was a kid when I read it and I found it crazy. Now I know that He was talking about Himself. He mixes material with spiritual and a sinner can never understand what God means.  "God tempts no man" and "God tempts men." God tempts no man because He is not Satan but God allows Satan to tempt men. Satan at times asks permission from God. (Remember Job)  .God is Peace, but He will fight. I exorcised demons from a girl and days later(because she had a Legion)she was freed. Now she is happy...she feels peace.Yes, God is warlike. God accepts human sacrifices....that is true...His Son, Jesus Christ...His sacrifice has paid the price for your sins...but He forbids sacrifices...it is a sin...remember Abraham and Isaac. God hates sin and will destroy sin and sinners...but in this age of grace He is tolerating sinners for now until the day comes when He destroys sin and the unrepentent sinner for ever. God dwells in light and in darkness. When I pray in a dark room I feel His presence. When you see God face to face sitting in His Great White Throne, then you will see that He is no contradiction.   Now why isn't that no one dares say that Satan is a contradiction? He is pure contradictions and lies and confusions. You know why no one dares? Because we are afraid to ask him because we know he is pure evil and can destroy us. But we dare to judge and sometimes curse God because He is so good a sap and will do us no harm.  That's what you think! As the world is going from good to worse with increasing sin He will tolerate no more just like He did when He divided Pangea with a world earthquake and flood destroying a beautiful but sinful civilization. Why not read the book of Job, my brother? Job was a rich man with flocks and a large family and he was happy. He loved God truly and was very faithful even when God allowed Satan to take away his riches, family, friends, and left hi m with an illness. But this great man said,"I know that my Redeemer lives and He will restore me. And if He rejects me(tho God rejects no one but sin)I will always love Him." In time God gave him back his life with double the blessings. Job wondered if God is a God of contradictions. God put him in his place and gave him the right answers.  Who are we to question God? Do you want to be like Job? But anyway you have the right to ask God questions. One day I asked God, "Father....do you love me?"  I was a security guard ten years ago. A little  boy came up to me whom I never met and said, "I love you." and he embraced me and went away. I was flabbergasted and tears went down my cheeks when my memory flashed out, "Father, do you love me?" Yes. God loves me and by His Providence He used a little child with a sincere emotion and no hypocrisy told me those wonderful words. "I love you."   Therefore, He loves you to, friend.|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	All of these so called "contradictions" are your inability to correctly deduce anything from the passages. For example how do you get in Gen 6:6 that god is changeable all it says is that he is sad that he created man. It really is annoying for people to take bible verses OUT OF CONTEXT and try to make them seem as if the bible is wrong. Let's try 2 Thes 2:11. The so called lying by proxy is not meant for everyone. If you read verse 4 you find out that it is punishment for those who put themselves above God and make people think that they are God. Please read the couple of verses before and after the seemingly contradictory verse and you might find that most of these in your list will go away. And as for the ones that still remain google the verse in a few different translations to help.

AA11521494	The trouble with Satanism is that the world is full of so much Christian propaganda about how evil Satan is that you get some people calling themselves Satanists just to be rebellious.  That's the kind you've come across.<br>  <br>  There are two major kinds of Satanism.  LaVeyan or atheistic Satanism regards Satan as a symbol for what lies within us and therefore doesn't believe in god or Satan at all.<br>  <br>  Theistic or traditional Satanism (and I am a traditional Satanist) is about a relationship with Satan.  We understand that there is light and dark, good and evil, love and hate in all of us and both sides need to be embraced for us to be completely fulfillled.  In all of those cases, they are two sides of the same thing.  It is largely about self-development and being everything we can possibly be.  We see Christianity and other mainstream religions as falling down because they cannot embrace those two sides and merely seek to suppress what they see as wrong.  This is damaging as what is naturally within us cannot be kept down - far better to acknowledge it and celebrate it, as long as it does not harm others.  That would infringe on their freedom to be themselves.  Suppressing natural lusts only leads to things like priests raping children.  We make use of the energies of the spiritual world through ritual and black magick.  Satan is very real to me, especially when I invoke His presence and He takes over for a little while.<br>  <br>  Sorry that may sound a little disjointed but I get so passionate when I write about this!|`|NmvaEmKBaa	I often choose various religions to claim when door to door religious salesman come calling.

There was a time in my life I did not have the energy to get up from the sofa to change the TV channel, no remotes then LOL!<br>  Today at times I am almost hyper at times with energy. The difference for me & in my experience has been working thru those issues & self concepts that literally would drain me of all energy each day. The things we stuff & hide away deep within are hidden at a price. They take a bit of our energy or awareness with them. In my case I had more hidden & stuffed at one point than open & available. It made me unable to function much of the time. Every form of refuge of this kind has it's price. There is only one refuge that gives rather than takes from us & it is to remember our first estate.

ZOifSvNhaa	In ancient Israel, King Jeroboam started a new religion almost a thousand years before Jesus came to earth. Jeroboam was the first king of the independent northern kingdom of Israel. He faced the challenge of rallying people to his cause. “The king took counsel and made two golden calves and said to the people: ‘It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel.’” (1 Kings 12:28) Clearly, the king wanted to use religion to direct the people’s loyalty away from Jerusalem, where they used to worship. The religion Jeroboam started lasted for centuries and resulted in ruin for millions when God eventually called that apostate nation of Israel to account. Jeroboam’s religion was a political expedient. Some State religions that continue to this day began similarly as efforts to strengthen political power.<br>  <br>  Many religions arose from a desire for political power, prestige, and popular acceptance rather than a desire to please God<br>  <br>  The apostle Paul revealed another motive that people have for starting a new religion when he said: “I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.” (Acts 20:29, 30) Proud leaders often start religious movements to draw attention to themselves.

History in England led to the creation of the anglican/episcopalian church.  Methodism came about because the anglicans were moribund in England so John Wesley took it upon himself to go out preaching and accidentally founded a new denomination.

You haven't explained why. If there was a cause, then it would be contained in the universe; but maybe things can happen spontaneously, or the cause might not always precede the effect. There may be plausible explanations put forward that might not agree with commonsense (merely a brainmap evolved in a way that helps with survival), and they might draw on quantum mechanics. But maybe we just need to admit that we don't know everything.<br>  <br>  Secondly, Professor Stephen Hawking describes in A Brief history Of Time that there may not have been a singularity, and that space-time, although finite, might have no boundary and no moment of "creation". And also, your argument about a cause requiring another cause ad infinitum explains nothing; a similar argument can be used about God and what caused God ad infinitum - the problem is merely moved from one place to another without solving it.<br>  <br>  And thirdly, although you apply the cause argument to the universe, you dismiss the problem about the cause of God by calling him "a self standing truth which needs not to be explained". This is a totally unsatisfactory position that merely postulates something without proof or real reason, so can be dismissed in the same way.<br>  <br>  Belief in God is based on faith, and faith is based upon nothing but itself. Science explains nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and religious beliefs are no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. And ideas discovered or postulated by science are the nearest thing we have to the truth about how nature works.<br>  <br>  Belief in a god probably goes back to times when people didn't understand how the seasons worked. And when winter came and the crops no longer grew, some sort of sacrifice would have been made to the sun, and then it came back and the crops grew. The people would have associated the sacrifice with the positive outcome, and they wouldn't have dared not do it again because they couldn't risk famine.<br>  <br>  In time the sacrifice will have become more sophisticated, and perhaps the idea came about that the sun might be the gift of a god rather than the god itself. This might be a way, or similar to a way, that religion developed. <br>  <br>  People would then have assumed that the laws that their ancestors devised came from the god, so the religion would have become even more sophisticated still, providing authority for the laws and fear of a vengeful god if laws were disobeyed, and the same fear would make others stone to death anyone who breached a law to avoid vengeance being visited on the whole community. <br>  <br>  There are probably other elements, but it will have gone back to the dawn of civilisation.<br>  <br>  The idea of the biblical God changes throughout the course of the Bible as does the name, and there seem to be several changes of Deity. For example, when Moses encounters God, God introduces himself as Yahweh (I am who am, I will be what I will be, etc), which is a different name to that used at the beginning of Genesis, Elohim, a plural of El a Canaanite (Phoenician) deity; continuity with previous beliefs is maintained by claiming to be the God of Abraham, Jacob (Israel) and Isaac. In fact the first Creation myth in Genesis probably derives from the Babylonian Creation Epic, Enuma Elish in which the Creator God's name is Marduk, probably via the Canaanites.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	it's obvious that you made all this up just now. no one knows what happened at time zero of the big bang cosmology, or even if that refers to a real event.<br>  <br>  "I'm not assigning any specific or personal attributes to him here"<br>  <br>  then why did you call it 'him'? how do you even know it's a person at all? you claim it's capable of 'working directly with spacetime material'. who is this guy, a cosmological potter? conciously or unconciously, you're just rewriting genesis here.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	"comprised of space and time"<br>  <br>  Actually, until the Big Bang, there was no space and time -- it wasn't comprised of it.<br>  <br>  Congratulations.

You are using "goddidit" to fill in a gap.<br>  <br>  If a cosmologist presents to you a viable, mathematically consistent hypothesis that shows the beginning of the universe to be possible without will, would you still believe this argument you've constructed?|`|ttTDiJWfaa	1.<br>  It is not always altogether impossible. The universe is huge and we will never understand it all. In the interest of intellectual fairness most atheists are reasonable enough to admit that. In fact, most well-read atheists who have contemplated the concept long enough have separated the possibility of a universal God from the problems created by Man-made worship.<br>  <br>  If there is a God after all, fine. Most atheists criticism lies with worship and atrocities created in the name OF God, not God per se.<br>  <br>  As one woman put it that made me award her best answer:<br>  "u never once made a fool of yourself by believing in a story and therefor you have not insulted me-God" <br>  <br>  2.<br>  This refers back to the argument that if God made the universe, what made God? Again, this argument usually points to Man inventing God as an explanation of what he cannot scientifically explain.<br>  Thus,most of the post-religion argument sees God as a product of war, torture, and other things of a more primitive ilk.<br>  <br>  3.<br>  This argument refers to the God-as-default-position, which is the essentially the same thing as a pre-scientific view of the universe.I understand what you are saying that it is of another, more eteranl dimetion, but the logic is is that an if an explantion  by science is irrelevant, the fundamentalist of today makes distinction between himself and the fundamentalist of biblical times.<br>  <br>  Science works on aproximating reality in a constant self-correcting mode. It will continue to grasp what is "there" and will attempt to analyize it without giving the fundamentalist a satisfying answer, because to him what is there is eternal so no explanation will ever do.<br>  <br>  Because this chasm of reasoning will always exist between scientist and fundamentalist,I think in the future there could a new breed of thinking that is neither religious nor atheist. It could be so absorbed in the perception of current acuality that such a discussion may cease to exist, specifically because "god" will be never be heard(religious) OR<br>  found(scientific).|`|pYomxgYfaa	Because there hasn't been any prove that he exists.<br>  <br>  Science is testable, we have things we can touch and see.

He was beatified and then on March 12, 1622, was canonized. His feast day is July 31. He is the patron saint of the Basque historical territories of Guipúzcoa and Biscay and the Society of Jesus, among other things<br>  <br>  Ignatius Loyola was the main creator and initial Superior General of the Society of Jesus, a religious organization of the Catholic Church whose members, known as Jesuits, served the Pope as missionaries. He is remembered as a talented spiritual director. He was very vigorous in opposing the Protestant Reformation and promoting the following Counter-Reformation. <br>  <br>  Ignatius Loyola wrote Spiritual Exercises, a simple 200-page set of meditations, prayers, and various other mental exercises, from 1522 to 1524.

I have to rely upon findings others produce.  I have an advantage over the researcher in that I can use more than on theory or opinion.  If I find a problem with someone in science, I have to provide a basis for my belief that is as good as his.  For example, I don't accept that all Native Americans ancestors crossed the Bering Straights.  I base this in part on the non-scientific evidence of the Native American's oral tradition.  I may be wrong, the Native American's may be wrong, but I have 'evidence' too.

Both are Spirit-filled - if anything, the Charismatic church has a lot more prophetic gifts being used during the service.  I think that firstly, people don't understand that Pentecostal encompasses different churches and church families (eg. AoG, Elim/Foursquare etc), and because they have seen one thing (like an outpouring of the Holy Spirit, or people speaking in tongues), they assume all Pentecostal churches are like that aaalll the time.  Pentecostal churches today are seen much like Methodist churches were seen back when they were started, because they didn't follow the establishment and sought to go back to the biblical version of the church.  People like tradition, and naturally we don't like change, and we don't like things that we can't physically explain - it can be scary.  The bible, however, does talk about gifts of the Spirit, and that the followers of Jesus would do even greater than he did.  Some people believe that the Holy Spirit only worked like this in biblical times.  And I do understand where you're coming from, because it is hurtful, and since we are all born again, we are supposed to be family in Christ.  But remember that this is a natural reaction to things we don't understand, and we still gotta love them! God bless ;-)|`|X2cdkfjgaa	Because a lot of Pentecostals are fundies.

What you have done is once again, taken information that is factual but left out much of the truth to make your point of contention.  In other words, you're preaching to the choir.  Those who don't believe will do as they have done and slam the Bible and those of us who understand what you're doing will just remain quiet until you decide you really want the truth about Jesus Christ.  I suspect you probably already know but you just can't let go of the past and step into the light.|`|907eccf187a1d01eb469d6a0a106913eaa	the Bible was compiled in the 4th century, not written.|`|wukXoRCMaa	the bible is fake dude|`|tpDICzslaa	Firstly, not all of the books of the New Testament were written by eyewitnesses to Jesus (St. Luke, for instance, probably was not a witness), but they were all written by people who were contemporary with him and who would at the very least have had access to eyewitnesses. <br>  <br>  Secondly, the average life span argument you make is a dubious one. Life expectancy statistics are generally skewed downwards by high rates of infant mortality. They can also be skewed by the difficulty of determining age at death from skeletal remains. Most diagnostic skeletal changes occur between childhood and young adulthood, so it can be quite hard to distinguish between an adult who died in late middle age and one who died in old age. Even if the average life expectancy of 40 can be relied upon, it is still only an average and there is plenty of Biblical evidence for people living longer. For instance Psalm 90 assumes a life-span of seventy years (three-score and ten) is normal and the Gospel of Luke notes that the prophetess Anna was 84 when she saw the infant Christ (Lk 2:37). Thus is it quite plausible that someone who was in their early twenties at the time of Christ might have lived until somewhere around 80-90 AD.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, what is your evidence for the assertion that the books of the bible were revised until 315 AD? Although the cannon of the Bible was not fixed until then the individual books were fixed in their written form much earlier. Simple logic tells us that if people were making arbitrary changes to the scriptures then there would have been arguments between believers over which were the correct versions and which were the corrupted ones. This would surely have been recorded somewhere, just as the rejection of the gnostic gospels was recorded, and just as early debates over christology are recorded. <br>  <br>  As it is there are only a few passages which are modern scholars think are insertions to the orginal text of the New Testament (eg the final few verses of Mark), and even these need not be particularly late ones.

Those people you love- you do not care if they are of this society's "beauty standards"... you just love love love them.  To you, they are beautiful because of your love and their love for you.  <br>  <br>  A man or woman could quickly get real sick of the most handsome/gorgeous spouse in the world if they were vain, useless, and a big jerk!  They would no longer even seem attractive.
mrMkKFqNaa	Because we're not close to the end...and they're starting to realiize that they are going to die in this system.<br>  <br>  The Watchtower/JW religion is based on a simple premise: "Millions Now Living Will Never Die."  There's just one problem...those people who were told that they would never die in the 1920s...they're all dead!<br>  <br>  Then there was the whole "generation of 1914" doctrine...we see how well that worked out.<br>  <br>  So, from the times of Russell to today, you have 5 or 6 generations of Watchtower/JW followers who were led to believe that the end would come in their lifetime.  Today you have elderly JWs who never expected to graduate from high school!  Now they're going to die in this "wicked old system."<br>  <br>  So, yes, I can see why there would be a lot of sad faces around Witness meetings and assemblies.  They've been sold a bill of goods.  And they will never get those years back.|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Brother Olin, I have been noticing a real lack of any joy in so many of the jw's in my old congo and even among those I encounter out in field service.  When I was a young jw we used to go out from door to door with enthusiasm and joy in our hearts.  Even when opposed we felt happy to be in Jah's service.  <br>  <br>  For a few years now I have seen depressed and even hostile looking people at the meetings and assemblies.  I can tell you that after talking with several of my former brothers and sister that many of them are doubting the validity of the society's claim to be Jah's organization and feel like the society is wrong but feel that there is no safe way to exit without being shunned and hated by their friends and families.<br>  <br>  I can see a pretty big exodus coming from there in a few more years.  After 2014 comes and goes and 100 years of Christ reigning and no Kingdom yet, many will see the lie for what it is and hopefully come to the REAL JESUS and serve Him rather than that vomitous watchtower society.|`|CGnL2nS0aa	Same reason so many people today are depressed and down and out...things are not going too well in the world and it is having a negative impact on both JW's and non JW's.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses as a whole are a happy people. But, there are some who are depressed and down. The tough living conditions we all have to live in does wear on you.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	because it looks like the generation is going to pass away and they've already extended the deadline too many times.|`|865bVfl3aa	Even though we are all looking forward to the New System and anticipate it coming soon we are all still dealing with all the problems in the world.  Many people have lost jobs recently and others are afraid of losing theirs. Add this to increases in disease and violence and you have a difficult system to smile in. <br>  The new system is going to be very exciting and peaceful, but we aren't there yet. It's easy to get down because of the world situation we are currently facing. Maybe you can help bring those smiles back by encouraging those around you to keep their focus on the Kingdom's impending arrival.|`|aeF5wIy1aa	Some jehovah witnesses came to my house on Saturday and the hubby insulted me.  Before I opened my door I heard them bickering about why the wife was showing so much leg.  She told him to shut up because she could hear me unlocking the door.  Since I have two bolts and a chain on it it takes me a little bit to open.<br>  <br>  I opened the door and told her that her skirt looked really nice!  She thanked me but apologized for making a scene at the door. She said her husband has control issues.  He was getting madder every time I smiled.<br>  <br>  So he told her that they had not come to my door to discuss fashion and asked me what I thought about the economy. I told him it was really in the crapper but I was doing fine because everyone needs a haircut and I have a thriving salon business and that my Lord Jesus was looking out for me in every way.  Well he said that I would be broke soon if I didn't get my head out of the sand and worship Jehovah who is higher than Jesus.<br>  <br>  I told him that I didn't want to discuss anything with him since he seemed too steamed to be discussing anything, especially spiritual things he said that I was too thick headed to understand him in any case.  So I closed my door and told them not to come back.  I could hear him tell his wife that I was not only a goat but a "B" too.  So I opened my door and I told him that I would pray for him and he got mad!  I called him a small minded misogynist and told his wife that I felt sorry for her and that she could have done much better than her cheesebrained mate. <br>  <br>  I imagine that globally the falsehoods they spread are coming back to them and destroying their joy.|`|ycH8jepGaa	Mankind can never know when the end is coming.

cECRv4NMaa	To be sensual has nothing to do with sex, however many will argue it is the same thing. It is how one conducts ones self, with confidence and for woman how they walk, with a gliding almost dance like movements.<br>  Adultery is being married to one person and having carnal (sexual) relations with someone who is not that person.

When we take a vow, God hates being unfaithful in that vow.  That is adultery and is why it can be adultery without ever doing anything more than flirting.  Faithfulness is a state of mind which is the place where vows are made.<br>  <br>  Edit: let me add that if one is not marired, sex is not allowed for it is only honorable in the marriage bed.|`|rcCYssKYaa	Sensuality=Lust<br>  Adultery=Cheating

Practice what your faith says and be nice to people.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Why don't you do something un-religious and LEAVE HIM ALONE|`|AA12360579	Well, by telling him you want him to stop being gay, you're telling him that you don't like him how he is.<br>  <br>  By not liking someone how they are, you don't love him.<br>  <br>  So if you don't like him being gay, then you don't really love your brother.<br>  <br>  Also, everybody sins, yes?  And all sins are considered equal in the eyes of God.  So if you told someone a lie, that is the same as your brother being gay.

LOVE THY BROTHER i believe your bible says. obviously not just your own flesh and blood, but all men. he will not change to make you happy, it's either you accept him for he IS now or you'll end up accepting him later for who he WAS when he was alive. nobody should have to bury their own kin.<br>  please respond|`|19JkC34Xaa	Nope.

Mere speech to God is not necessarily prayer, as is seen in the judgment in Eden and in the case of Cain. (Ge 3:8-13; 4:9-14) Prayer involves devotion, trust, respect, and a sense of dependence on the one to whom the prayer is directed. The various Hebrew and Greek words relating to prayer convey such ideas as to ask, make request, petition, entreat, supplicate, plead, beseech, beg, implore favor, seek, inquire of, as well as to praise, thank, and bless.<br>  <br>  Petitions and supplications, of course, can be made to men, and the original-language words are sometimes so used (Ge 44:18; 50:17; Ac 25:11), but “prayer,” used in a religious sense, does not apply to such cases. One might “beseech” or “implore” another person to do something, but in so doing he would not view this individual as his God. He would not, for example, silently petition such one, nor do so when the individual was not visibly present, as one does in prayer to God.<br>  <br>  The “Hearer of Prayer.” The entire Scriptural record testifies that Jehovah is the One to whom prayer should be directed (Ps 5:1,?2; Mt 6:9), that he is the “Hearer of prayer” (Ps 65:2; 66:19) and has power to act in behalf of the petitioners. (Mr 11:24; Eph 3:20) To pray to false gods and their idol images is exposed as stupidity, for the idols do not have the ability either to hear or to act, and the gods they represent are unworthy of comparison with the true God. (Jg 10:11-16; Ps 115:4,?6; Isa 45:20; 46:1, 2, 6,?7) The contest concerning godship between Baal and Jehovah, held on Mount Carmel, demonstrated the foolishness of prayer to false deities.—1Ki 18:21-39; compare Jg 6:28-32.<br>  <br>  Though some claim that prayer may properly be addressed to others, such as to God’s Son, the evidence is emphatically to the contrary. True, there are rare instances in which words are addressed to Jesus Christ in heaven. Stephen, when about to die, appealed to Jesus, saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” (Ac 7:59) However, the context reveals a circumstance giving basis for this exceptional expression. Stephen at that very time had a vision of “Jesus standing at God’s right hand,” and evidently reacting as if he were in Jesus’ personal presence, he felt free to speak this plea to the one whom he recognized as the head of the Christian congregation. (Ac 7:55,?56; Col 1:18) Similarly, the apostle John, at the conclusion of the Revelation, says, “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.” (Re 22:20) But again the context shows that, in a vision (Re 1:10; 4:1,?2), John had been hearing Jesus speak of his future coming and thus John responded with the above expression of his desire for that coming. (Re 22:16,?20) In both cases, that of Stephen and that of John, the situation differs little from that of the conversation John had with a heavenly person in this Revelation vision. (Re 7:13,?14; compare Ac 22:6-22.) There is nothing to indicate that Christian disciples so expressed themselves under other circumstances to Jesus after his ascension to heaven. Thus, the apostle Paul writes: “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.”—Php 4:6.<br>  <br>  The article APPROACH TO GOD considers the position of Christ Jesus as the one through whom prayer is directed. Through Jesus’ blood, offered to God in sacrifice, “we have boldness for the way of entry into the holy place,” that is, boldness to approach God’s presence in prayer, approaching “with true hearts in the full assurance of faith.” (Heb 10:19-22) Jesus Christ is therefore the one and only “way” of reconciliation with God and approach to God in prayer.—Joh 14:6; 15:16; 16:23,?24; 1Co 1:2; Eph 2:18; see JESUS CHRIST (His Vital Place in God’s Purpose).

Creationist believe the world is like 6000 years ol not 2000.  Jesus was born 2000 some odd years ago !!!  <br>  <br>  Secondly, please do not lump all Christians into this pack.  I happen to believe that the world is much older and I am a Christian.  I also find science interesting (though I have little capacity for it personally) and believe it confirms God rather than disproves His existence.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	Never heard of the 2,000 year bit you're referring too.|`|907eccf187a1d01eb469d6a0a106913eaa	I think the fundamental principles in Genesis are there whether or not its characters and events are historical.<br>  <br>  Genesis can be summarized as an allegory representing order and purpose in creation. To me, the story of Adam and Eve illustrates the natural tendency of each person to deviate from what is good- a propensity of the human condition and not some linear, inherited curse.<br>  <br>  It might sound cynical but I think it's evident even without theism or deep philosophical thought that humans do not naturally choose good.<br>  <br>  1600 years ago St. Augustine advocated that biblical interpretation should not conflict with science and God-given reason. But even without modern science, it seems obvious that the writer(s) of Genesis did not intend for it to be read literally.<br>  A literal interpretation of Genesis would contradict itself in more than a few places (e.g. the order of creation changes in chapter two and the number of animals on the ark is inconsistently stated.)<br>  The style of Genesis is also too vague and equivocal to draw a meaningful conclusion from (e.g. "kinds" of animals? should the six "days" be literal when elsewhere in the Bible it says a "day" to God can be thousands of years?)<br>  <br>  Alone, Genesis would provide an overly simplistic explanation of how God made the universe. The Bible altogether, treated as a replacement for science, would provide a severely insufficient explanation of how the universe works.<br>  So again, besides the clear contradictions in a literal interpretation within itself as well as other verses the Bible, Genesis is also too vague to conclude any meaningful knowledge about the physical world.<br>  <br>  It's the writing style in Genesis, and basic scientific understanding (e.g. the earth being made before the sun does not mesh with gravity and planetary formation, and the fruits that Adam and Eve were alive, so death must have existed before a literal "fall of man".. etc.) that leads me to conclude Genesis must be figurative. And I think it's more profound and meaningful in that light.|`|f4G8wOhHaa	I wonder if you were aware that carbon dating is not accurate. A certain mammoth had been unearthed by paleontologists in the Arctic. At a different layer, some several feet down, another mammoth apparently had died in the same location, but was thousands of years older. When they finally completed the excavation, they discovered it was the same mammoth. The scientists quickly realized that in the presence of water, carbon dating can be greatly skewed. <br>  Guess what! The Flood of Noah's time was composed of water that filled the entire globe. That was science in action.<br>  <br>  2000 years...from the time Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden to the time of the Great Flood. Roughly 2000 years from the Flood to Moses' time. Around 2000 years from Moses to Yeshua, and about 2000 years from Yeshua to today. The Flood can account for all of the "Ice Ages". People living for hundreds of years can account for the "Neanderthals" which had heavier bones...since modern medical science can attest that as a person ages, the calcium thickens and goes toward the ends of the bones....<br>  There is a whole bunch of science that many would rather overlook in the Bible.|`|sQ2vg6jVaa	Firstly it is 6000 years since Adam & Eve<br>  Secondly, radioactive carbon dating is notoriously inaccurate, making things sampled appear ridiculously older than they actually are.<br>  I certainly wouldn't put my faith in the misguided opinions of scientists, who try to refute God's word through their erroneous experiments.<br>  I trust God, after all he was there when he made everything|`|UtE4QdBraa	No Christians have ever said that the world was created 2,000 years ago.

As a straight-man and a straight-blogger, I used to go to conservative churches that teach that abstinence crap, and I learned that the leaders of these churches actually crack jokes about 30 and 40 year-old virgins behind their backs. Now I just send my Christian friends to the site below which debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible. It's cheaper than a Purity Ring and a lot more fun than abstinence.

The cards don't say Hey I'm a 3rd grader let's have sex and have babies.  You can't shelter your children from every thing that you don't agree with but rather teach them strong moral values and hope that they lead the life you wish for them.  If you do shelter them when they move away on their own the world and its ways will come to them as a complete shock.

jcK6EXpiaa	haha, if its me your talking about, I am more than happy to clear up a few of your misconceptions. I only relate my religion when proving a sterotype wrong, either against native americans, or Muslims. I guess I could go around saying I am a white Muslim if I wanted, because I do have european DNA in me. I do not ever remember calling you a KKK member, but I have used this example several times in showing the difference between what Christianity is SUPPOSED to be, VS what extremeist groups have done to it. I use this example when describing the Taliban VS Islam.  My motive for following is simple, it is merely what I believe. I believe that Muhammad (pbuh) was the last messenger to be sent to Humankind before the return of Jesus. Just as you, being Catholic, like my sister, have faith that Jesus was the last messenger. I do not spite Christianity, I despite what CHRISTIANS have done, or those who claim to be christian. YES, I do resent the continued repression of Native Americans, it isn't all "back inthe 1500's" if you had a single drop of knowlege that did not come from a TV, you would know that the Seattle area was not even on US maps until the late 1800's. Even then, my people still exist, and so long as we are oppressed, this history is current. HISPANICS are native american, I don't see how you can argue with this one. It would be like me trying to say the Scottish arent native to Europe now that Scotland is part of Britan. And Islam came to America LONG before Christianity. The Muslim explorers had healthy, well established relationships with the natives of the Caribbean (how do you think the natives on Haiti knew arabic when Columbus stumbled upon them, eh?) Anyways, what is happening in Sudan is disgusting. Those "muslims" enslaving and creating acts of Genocide against the Sudanese people will pay their price in the afterlife, trust me, God does not sleep. Thank goodness Islamic Countries like Senegal (a west african country) are taking in Refugees from Sudan and giving them citizenship.  Like I said earlier in regards to Christianity VS Christians, there is a difference between what Islam is supposed to be, vs what people claiming it have done. Through Education and prayer, may you find peace with me. I am sorry if I ever offended you or hurt your feelings. <br>  <br>  God Bless<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: and in response to some other folks...<br>  I graduated highschool a year early. The highschool I graduated from consisted of me and seven of my cousins. No competition between us, we're all really intelligent. I was too caught up in reality and books to care about much else.<br>  <br>  As for my view on Christianity, YES, I do think people have the teachings of Jesus WARPED. their missionaries, those who are SUPPOSED to know scripture better than most, couldn't quite get the ten commandments down, especially "though shalt not kill". However, I think Jesus is a good man, and wish nothing but peace and gods blessings on him. When he returns, he will be the first to tell you what he thinks about his missionaries.<br>  <br>  As for my intelligence, sure, I suck at spelling and grammar. I am also only second generation english speaking. Other than that, would you like to compare IQ's??? :) I'd also like to point out that Darwin and Einstein were religous.<br>  <br>  I'd like to add a question to this: You have made up a few lies, I never remember having an open dialogue with you.

D9lMg7A2aa	Being a Catholic (which I am) means believing that the Catholic Church is the Church instituted by Jesus to guard His teaching on Faith and Morals. The Church is the focal point of the relationship with Christ.<br>  <br>  As to what the rules are, they are few as far as discipline goes. <br>  The five are in the Catechism<br>  <br>  2041 The precepts of the Church are set in the context of a moral life bound to and nourished by liturgical life. The obligatory character of these positive laws decreed by the pastoral authorities is meant to guarantee to the faithful the very necessary minimum in the spirit of prayer and moral effort, in the growth in love of God and neighbor:<br>  <br>  2042 The first precept ("You shall attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor") requires the faithful to sanctify the day commemorating the Resurrection of the Lord as well as the principal liturgical feasts honoring the mysteries of the Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the saints; in the first place, by participating in the Eucharistic celebration, in which the Christian community is gathered, and by resting from those works and activities which could impede such a sanctification of these days.82<br>  <br>  The second precept ("You shall confess your sins at least once a year") ensures preparation for the Eucharist by the reception of the sacrament of reconciliation, which continues Baptism's work of conversion and forgiveness.83<br>  <br>  The third precept ("You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season") guarantees as a minimum the reception of the Lord's Body and Blood in connection with the Paschal feasts, the origin and center of the Christian liturgy.84<br>  <br>  2043 The fourth precept ("You shall observe the days of fasting and abstinence established by the Church") ensures the times of ascesis and penance which prepare us for the liturgical feasts and help us acquire mastery over our instincts and freedom of heart.85<br>  <br>  The fifth precept ("You shall help to provide for the needs of the Church") means that the faithful are obliged to assist with the material needs of the Church, each according to his own ability.86<br>  <br>  The faithful also have the duty of providing for the material needs of the Church, each according to his own abilities.87|`|93galWG1aa	<a href="http://www.thecatholictreasurechest.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecatholictreasurechest.com/...</a><br>  Read this and know your making the right move.<br>  The Catholic church is a Holy Body, No food only the Eucharist.<br>  Holy Divine Music.<br>  I know that the Catholic faith is the truth of Christ, it is beyond all things in Life because it is the living Body of Christ.<br>  In her is the fullness of truth and Salvation.<br>  Out side of it the is only Heresy.<br>  If you want Christ Here he is.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	If you're really serious, then talk to a Catholic priest, not random people over the internet.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	4th Reich gave a good answer, even if he did get it from youtube lol.|`|z74a7wvlaa	What YA posters have recommended are all excellent.

That she is sinless.  They pray to her etc.  Other denominations do not believe that, nor is that taught in the Bible.  As far as I know Catholics can't eat meat on Friday during Lent and those are the only foods that I know of they can't eat.  Then there is confession, where you confess your sins to a Priest, which again no other denomination does that. (except possibly episcopalian )   Methodists and others believe it is between you and god, there is no Middle Man so to speak.  There is also confirmation and communion in the Catholic church you have to go through these before you can become a Catholic, and Methodists require none of this. When all is said and done both believe in the Trinity, and the major stuff is the same, as is the end result. (Eternal Life) IMO Catholicism is too strict and there are too many man made rules that don't make sense to me.|`|RoYL4tyjaa	I believe in God,<br>  the Father Almighty,<br>  Creator of Heaven and earth. <br>  <br>  I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,<br>  who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br>  born of the Virgin Mary,<br>  suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br>  was crucified, died and was buried.<br>  He descended to the dead.<br>  On the third day, He rose again.<br>  He ascended to Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>  He will come again to judge the living and the dead. <br>  <br>  I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>  the Holy Catholic Church,<br>  the communion of saints,<br>  the forgiveness of sins,<br>  the resurrection of the body,<br>  and life everlasting.

There's some music I don't listen to because I don't like it.<br>  <br>  I recommend you to talk with a non fundamentalist priest.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	Maybe you should talk to a priest instead of Yahoo answers.|`|jH7NroYjaa	Well, I'm what you call cafeteria Catholic (which means I celebrate the holidays, but don't generally go to parish) Here we go:<br>  <br>  - It's very hard to be damned. It's not like in Protestantism where you watch an R- rated movie or something and you have to worry that your soul is going to burn in hell. I mean, you have to be VERY BAD to even enter the gates of Hell.<br>  - We do not discuss The Rapture, and many do not believe in it, because in the Old Testament states "World without End."<br>  - Purgatory is the "waiting room" where good people who did not believe in God, learn, and therefore have a chance to enter heaven if they accept the truth.<br>  - Easter is a bigger holiday than Christmas, when it comes to religious clout, seeing as how Christmas is more of a commercial holiday.<br>  - Fish on Friday, but only if you're very orthodox.<br>  - Virginity is seen as very sacred, and to only be shared with the person you're planning to spend the rest of your life with.<br>  - The first two years after a woman gives birth, she is regarded as pure and holy as the Mother, and if she wishes "not to put out" it is not a neglectful sin against her husband. It is considered a time of rest.<br>  - We do not believe in soliciting Catholocism (aka evangelists). A religion is not to be profited from.<br>  - Acts of charity are no longer valid if they are made public<br>  - The money that the Vatican has is from years of being political poobahs. We acknowledge the gruesome wars and past sins; we are not proud of them, but history must be told to not be repeated.<br>  - Masturbation is considered a sin in the eyes of those who are orthodox, but many conservative or liberal catholics take a more Judaism approach on the topic and only deem it as a sin if one id married because then it is an act of self- love.<br>  - Abortion is only performed if the woman and the child are endangered (such as a tubular pregnancy). Rape cases are also highly considered.<br>  - Divorce unfortunately, is not recognized, but it can be annulled.<br>  - Witchcraft is evil. Period. There is not such thing as white magic, black magic, blah, blah, blah, it is sinful, and delving into Satan's playground.<br>  - Exorcisms are done quietly, not like in the movies when everyone is screaming and throwing a fit.<br>  - Issues such as stigmata and ectoplasm, are not quite decided upon yet.<br>  - We do not idolworship. When a person is praying to the Mother or a saint, the person is giving Mary or the saint a minor message to give to God, because we know that our problems are not always as important as others.<br>  - Some parishes perform services in Latin.<br>  - Parishes are not seen as social clubs. If any socialization is done, it is done after service for tea.<br>  - Breakfast is not eaten on Sundays (I forget why); that's why there is a small lunch or tea after.<br>  - Living your life "saving souls" and collecting "Heaven brownie points" is a sin, and considered a waste of life by means of pride.<br>  - Some very orthodox people think that communion is the body and blood of Christ. Some people will not even bite down on the wafer, they'll let it dissolve. It is nutty. Normal Catholics understand that it is a symbol of sacrifice and chew the freakin wafer.<br>  - We don't have "Christian Rock". As long as a person isn't listening to Satanic, ammoral sexual music, anything is pretty much okay, seriously. Returning the Latin issue, we have Gregorian chants, which are performed by trained vocalists, and are of the Rosary.<br>  - Drinking and smoking are one's own business.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you must recognize that Protestantism, is not Catholicism. Catholicism came first, and yes has created a lot of problems, and the church admits to that. Some popes are not recognized by certain parishes; a lot of people think the current pope is a bit of a pill. As well, other religions are not to be mocked. Remember when The Love Guru came out, the Vatican boycotted it because it mocked Hinduism. No relgion is perfect, Catholicism has a lot of skeletons in the closet, but what religion doesn't? We are also not afraid to admit that we are blatantly wrong, especially when it comes to the violent history.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped :)|`|FDVuAiHOaa	The main part of Catholicism that is so different from other Christian churches is the real presence - the belief that Jesus' actual body and blood are present in the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  If you can buy that, then head to a church and ask some questions.

I'd tell my adult kids to mind their own darn business, and if they were still minors and under my roof, they would certainly be excused from participating, but they sure as heck are not going to tell me what to believe or how to worship.  The same, frankly, would go with my parents or anyone else.  I would not give up my faith for the comfort or satisfaction of anyone but myself.  <br>  <br>  As it happens, two of my three older kids are members of my coven now, and the third, while having a different faith, sometimes still asks to participate in rituals.  Our younger two kids are not old enough to initiate, but they're fascinated, and love to help and do crafts at ritual times.  <br>  <br>  I mean, honestly, I can't imagine a situation in which it is appropriate for a child to manipulate and control their parent's right to decide matters of faith for themselves.

God is forgiving, but he teaches there is only one way to get to heaven and that is by believing in Jesus.  Even the best person in the world won't get to heaven by being a good person without accepting Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. This is what the Bible teaches, and what Christians believe.|`|XqpRYh52aa	If a god existed then that would be the true test as to whether he really was loving and forgiving.|`|9d43ec02a222734089d9cf48ceafea47aa	i remember reading somewhere in the bible a passage that said neither Dogs ,sorcerers liars ,ETC would get into heaven.|`|7sEFufRbaa	No, I don't believe so, not everyone will get into heaven and would you want everyone to be able to get into heaven?  <br>  <br>  I'm going to make another assumption for the sake of argument and say that you are a good person.  So being a good person when you pass on you'll be welcome into heaven.  In heaven you'll be greeted by the likes of Nero, Vlad the Impaler, Genghis Khan, Nobunaga, Pol Pot, Hitler, Mussolini, etc. etc.  Doesn't that sound great and perfectly logical!<br>  <br>  The very idea of those men (and I use the term loosely) making their way into heaven after all the evil and atrocities they've committed is practically blasphemous.  Yes the Lord will forgive all who ask of Him but I sincerely doubt that men as incredibly evil as the aforementioned would be so inclined to humble themselves before God.

Z4avhg3eaa	I don't care for the sort of dystopian Pascal's wager that a lot of believers use. I like a version that was first proposed by the Buddha 2500 years ago: <br>  <br>  Let's say that there is no afterlife.  You live as your please, with no restraint and little regard for proper conduct or morals.  Then you die.  There is no consequence, but you have developed a bad name for yourself, and if you are sufficiently unrestrained, probably ran into legal trouble.  But if there is an afterlife, you'll go to hell for the things you did.<br>  <br>  Let's say again that there is no afterlife, but you choose to live a good, virtuous life.  In this life, you develop a reputation for being a good person, and by and large, you live without trouble.  Then you die, and you end a good life with a good name for yourself.  But if there is an afterlife...<br>  <br>  You go to heaven because of the virtuous life that you've lived. <br>  <br>  This comes from the Kalama Sutta (Anguttara Nikaya 3:65)|`|tManvxfQaa	well i have already followed mans ways and died and went to the worse place ever and that was and is Hell.............<br>  <br>  So i Know WITHOUT Doubt Gods way is correct cause HE was the ONLY ONE who came to deliver me from hell, that mans path sent me down to !!|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Interesting thought.  First, the easy part, we cannot hedge our bets in our faith.  You are either for God or against him.  Second, if we are wrong there is no evidence to show us this truth.

But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce, like the bird. Could we? And nothing may touch it to build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution? <br>  <br>  My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance? <br>  <br>  Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?<br>  <br>  How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with an education and a computer, is it really sensible to think that flies did it by themselves?"<br>  <br>  The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage). <br>  <br>  So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"<br>  <br>  All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if 900+ enzymes could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?<br>  <br>  This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Mike|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Christian Responses to the "New Atheists"<br>  <br>      * The Dawkins Delusion?

uLYlQMs3aa	Well the common belief is that those who do not repent will be thrown in hell for eternity and suffer continuously. Um but the Bible says that the wages of sin are death the gift of God is eternal life. So my question is why would God give someone eternal life just to watch them burn? I mean come on. The same people that believe that are the same people that claim he is merciful. No wonder people make fun of Christians. <br>  The actuality of it is God's Bible does teach that Hell exists and that un repentant people will be thrown in, but it will destroy them. They will cease to exist. Its Eternal Punishment not Eternal Punishing.

[4:148]<br>  <br>  (2) The Wasters<br>  (Musrifeen)<br>  O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer: eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth not the wasters.  [7:31]<br>  <br>  (2) The Arrogant<br>  (Mustakbireen)<br>  Undoubtedly Allah doth know what they conceal, and what they reveal: verily He loveth not the arrogant.
