Its called a"Hot Dog"!!!!!!!|`|Yse77tSraa	ewwwww. that is not true. i bet he was just joking. im spanish and people dont eat dog meat. maybe it is beef. the enchiladas that are made from meat are from beef. not dog meat. you dont have a heart, trying to eat your dog.|`|10KYfxctaa	No   im spanish and enchiladas are made from beef or chicken  iv heard of people eating dog before but only in like the army(to gain courage)  anyway the dog could have rabies even if you got it vaccinated it could still be harmful to the consumers.  why dont you just burry the dog instead of eating it.|`|CoxTzgHlaa	You really loved that dog, huh?|`|ChUplrj2aa	EWWW.... thats not even cute. your boyfriend must be like SAVAGE to the maximum because im mexican and WE dont eat dogs. but you know if your bf is cruel, nasty and savage like that go for it.|`|7J5q3jk5aa	she/he is joking around with u|`|5yUeavD1aa	yes it is made out of dog i saw them kill a dog and ate it i was freak out|`|3p5HqomJaa	Burry the dam animal already!!!|`|Zxw2Q1GAaa	am mexican and we certainly dont eat DOG meat. thats nasty.   enchiladas can be made from chicken or beef...  and y would u eat ur dog thats just sick?

JfVxCDb7aa	Too late for starbucks to recover. The 5 million plus AMericans who have lost their jobs no longer go out to Starbucks. THey dring instant at home.  Tuna sandwiches would bring in more revenue for them. An entire sandwich line would pull me and many others in downtown Minneapolis to patronize one of the 7 downtown Starbucks.|`|JyghcEWpaa	Because young teenagers are not part of the market Starbucks is trying to attract.  Have you seen their prices?  I mean you can't even buy water for less than 3.00 and they can only charge but so much for powdered chocolate and 4 mini marshmallows.|`|8cDd70dSaa	Starbucks does make hot chocolate...it's on their menu...just without marshmallows.    And they don't serve sandwiches normally. They only serve sweets that go well with coffee (brownies, cookies, danish, muffins, etc.).|`|r1mmYhBQaa	They already have hot cocoa.  And they wouldn't make tuna sandwiches, because it's not a sandwich shop.  There are plenty of coffee drinkers, and I know my Starbucks is never empty even with their lack of tuna. :)      Edit:  They have tea too.  If you're not into sweets, you should go to a deli or sandwich shop and you'll find what you're looking for.|`|2jBtScVcaa	umm okay they do make hot chocolate as already and who eats tuna sandwiches gross... well i guess my opinion on that doesn't matter since i don't eat meat or fish...|`|W48xQOJOaa	i don't know ask the owner|`|AA10250709	Because they're targeting their customers....who go to starbucks for the coffee.|`|tmZC7pkuaa	I'm a teen.

There are no In-N-Outs where he lives and he gets withdrawals! <br>  <br>  Everything is great -- and cheaper than McDonalds, not that McD's can compare. The shakes are terrific. Get your burger Animal style! <br>  <br>  Even if the line is long (it generally goes out into the street along the curb in Pasadena), it will move pretty quickly, they'll usually have someone come out and take orders at your car to keep things moving. <br>  <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.in-n-out.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp</a><br>  <br>  Since you're young and can eat lots of burgers, I'll also suggest Tommy's, it's on Hill Ave, about a block up from Colorado Bl where most of the parade is.  <a href="http://www.originaltommys.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.originaltommys.com/</a><br>  <br>  The Hat is on Lake Ave at Villa, north of the freeway, about 6 blocks north of Colorado.

Get lots of those hand-warmers at a camping store for before the parade.  = )|`|AA10975447	There is a "secret" menu at In-N-Out that is worth exploring.<br>  <br>  Ever heard of Animal Style? They cook the patty with some mustard and add grilled onion and pickles to the burger. Very popular.<br>  <br>  (Contrary to what Surfer Dude said, raw onions are standard on the burgers. You have to request grilled onions)<br>  <br>  And don't limit yourself to a double-double. You can go BIGGER if you want. There's the 4 by 4, which is 4 patties and 4 slices of cheese. Similarly, a 2 by 4 is two patties, 4 slices of cheese. If you haven't figured it out yet, the formula is (patties by cheese).<br>  <br>  One of my favorites is the Flying Dutchman -- that's 2 patties, 2 slices of cheese, nothing else. They plop it onto a piece of burger wrap and give you a fork.<br>  <br>  And fries can be ordered extra crispy -- just ask for them "well done." It takes longer because they have to cook you a fresh batch, but it's worth the 5 minutes!!!<br>  <br>  And if you're going to travel for the Rose Bowl, you might as well do a little extra traveling and go to the flagship In-N-Out in Baldwin Park. BP is not far from Pasadena. Go east on the 210 fwy, south on the 605 fwy and east on the 10fwy. Exit Francisquito.

cIczdgqraa	Under Colorado law, you generally have to be at least 14 to hold a job. You can do some limited jobs, like baby-sitting, delivering advertisement circulars, gardening at a younger age. But you need to be 14 to work in a store or office, for example. If you want to see the ages you can do particular kinds of jobs, click here:  http://74.125.45.132/search?q=cache:9ML0...  and then just hit up top where it says , this is the html version of the file.      But although it is legal to hold a job at 14, that doesn't mean you will be able to get hired at that age. The problem is that you are competing with kids who are 16, 17 and 18. They are applying for the same kinds of jobs. Most employers would prefer to hire an older kid, because they assume that the older ones will be more responsible. So, if you want to get hired when you are younger, you have to make it a point to act maturely from the moment you walk in the door. They will start judging you as soon as you ask for a job application. Be sure to dress neatly (no dirty sneakers, no torn jeans, no wild t-shirts). Just act as grown up and maturely as you can.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	you only have to be 7 years old|`|lW2W1ApBaa	I had to work when I was 8 years old to help support my family, enjoy your youth, if you don't have to work don't..

LkDgsxGbaa	I work in a well known cafe in Texas that experiences a high volume of customers on a daily basis.  The volume has slightly slowed down due to the economy.  People are definitely being tighter with their tips.  Another phenomena that is happening is that customers are being more demanding and unpleasant due to their financial situation.  Customers are figuring out ways to receive as much as possible for free.  People are ordering more "specials" and are opting to drink water instead of their usual soda or tea.  Beer and wine sales have definitely dropped and more customers are complaining about prices (even though they have not changed in over a year).  People splitting meals have become an epidemic in our restaurant. Another trend has been adults trying to order off of a kid's menu.  People have lost all shame and are doing things that would embarrass most people. People splitting meals, eating all of the free items as possible (bread, crackers) and drinking water seems like an unpleasant way to dine out in my opinion.  When I go out to eat I want to be able to enjoy my own meal, drink whatever beverage I choose, and not bloat out on bread.  If I have to worry about the price of everything and embarrass myself by nickel and diming a restaurant then I would rather stay at home.  Dining out should be a pleasant experience.  The economy has definitely affected people's behavior and spending habits.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	What's wonderful? the fact that tips are down? shame on you!|`|AA10804824	We have less customers (ESPECIALLY January after the spending frenzy of the holidays), but my customers have the decency to tip appropriately. "If you can't afford to tip, don't go out, or go somewhere cheaper"  EDIT: I am in South Chicago, and really not feeling it. I'm making slightly less than average.|`|ljFBfguRaa	Definitely. Less customers overall and lower tips.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	Definitly. But I think the worst part is its not so much business not coming in, its just people tipping less. So we are still getting people in and running around, but it doesnt add up like it used to at the end of the night.|`|AA11112224	I have seen less people in the door, but tips haven't really changed much. I work at a Hooters and I feel that's more of a place where people feel more obligated to tip because we do more than just serve food, we provide entertainment and a fun atmosphere for our guests.     *Please no dirty/bad comments about where I work. It's an honest side job to pay the bills, and some people can be real rude about it.|`|8e6z8iUHaa	Nope. They aren't too bad at all. I mean, there's always certain people who will always tip low regardless of the economy. But mine are pretty much the same.|`|t0MiDBMEaa	Well, I am not a waitress but I have not been eating out as often since the economy has changed.  But, my husband and I always tip a little extra because we heard that waiters get paid less than minimum wage.|`|iwe9KUckaa	I've noticed that less people have been dining out in recent months, and while I almost always used to always get 20+% tips, it's been more in the 15% range. I used to average around $100-150 on a lunch shift, and lately it's been more like $40-60, so yeah, I'm feeling a pinch here in Chicago.|`|zhq5sW4laa	YESSSSSS!!!!!! My sales are not nearly as high as they used to be so i dont make as much money. people are not eating out as much anymore so thats less tips. the owner of the place i worked out said that he is down 65 tho in the last year.....

1d02e8c6d67c12c5dbe96eb8f1612081aa	I am a Ketchup aholic and i perfur the bowls they give you instead of the little packets. they are messy and they dont let me get enough out. Why do they give us only 2 packets at the fast food joints anyway? I like at wendy's where you can go to the pump thing and get as much as you want. I do perfur bottles at home.  Does that help answer your question? I put Ketchup on everything from fries to meat except steak. Thats for the A1 sauce.    :)|`|JGkYyIhJaa	the bottle because the packets have so little ketchup and by the end  you have twenty ripped packets everywhere|`|PZ5ozKY1aa	The bottle is by far the most environmentally friendly.

If I'm at home I'll use a bottle because I know it hasn't expired.     If I'm at a fast food place I'll use the packets unless I'm taking the food home... where I'll use the bottle.     If I'm at a fancy restaurant I'll use the bottle but sparingly, simply because I don't how often they are cleaned, and if the ketchup that's in them is fresh or if it has been mixed with old ketchup.|`|tmZC7pkuaa	Bottles. it bothers me when i have to open a dump load of little packets for the amount of ketchup i want. it also reduces the plastic from all of the packets.|`|LochBxhlaa	i prefer bottles but if im out i'll take a packet.|`|79c9dc74d3c2dbf1817a9346923a19d7aa	Bottle For Sure!

LkDgsxGbaa	Olive Garden is a great restaurant for a first time server.  This restaurant teaches you a combination of fine dining skills and family style service.  Menu knowledge is mandatory if you want to be a good server and be able to answer questions from customers.  You need to know what substitutions are free and what require an additional charge.  Customers hate surprise charges on their bills.  Watch other servers who have been in the business for a long time, as they have learned ways to consolidate their time and give speedy, efficient service.  Learn to read your customer's personalities.  Some customers prefer a low-key, unobtrusive server, while others prefer an outgoing and funny server.  Olive Garden is notorious for giving servers small sections, which is great for a new server, not so great for an experienced server used to larger sections, hence more opportunity to make more money.  Your tips should be good, but due to the small sections and having to tip-out various other restaurant positions, the money will not be great.  After you have some experience under your wing, I would suggest moving to another, non-chain restaurant where you will have larger sections and not as many hands dipping into your tips.  Do your best to learn as much as possible from other experienced servers.  There will be unpleasant customers no matter how well you do, so don't take it personally.  When you make a mistake don't let it ruin your whole night.  Do your best to correct it and move on to your next table with a smile.  Try to relax and enjoy your tables as best as possible and you will find that your job can actually be fun.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	nope never been a waiter|`|8juUgSK2aa	dont bug the customers too much. They don't go there to eat for you. Try to anticipate what they want|`|zhq5sW4laa	multi task....... smile a lot and act interested in ur customers. I've dont this job for five years. you'll do great if u take my advice
MtoIxY6Qaa	16 years of age. :)|`|VXcp8hvHaa	12 no permit needed|`|uS8Cen7raa	screw mcdonalds go work at a real job
qSc29x9iaa	I had some of the McDonalds Arabica coffee when it first came out and it tasted the same as their old coffee!    The ONLY coffee I have found to be consistently good, fast, and reasonably priced is at 7-11.    PS I usually brew my own with boiling water and a Melitta manual drip coffee maker.  It never disappoints!|`|FftR5yToaa	Starbucks is much better!!|`|Um7mYM71aa	I dont think they're the same coffee.|`|ehmeG65gaa	i agree! it's aweful, no more work or skill goes into it and honestly i think it taste worse, almost burnt now!  i think i miss read the question, i thought we were comparing old mcd's coffee to new mcd's coffee! starbucks is overpriced definatly a luxury but mcd's doesn't compare!|`|AA11091315	Starbucks. McDonalds is getting ridiculous with their pathetic little McCafes.|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	STARBUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|W48xQOJOaa	starbucks. mcdonalds go to far i mean come on iced coffe whats next iced hot chocolate|`|AA11466534	i dont know i hate coffee|`|fHZjRA5Saa	2 BAD STARBUCKS IS WAAAAAAAAY BETTER!!! LOL XDD|`|FecoGS68aa	starbucks.    mcdonalds new coffee sucks!|`|oPRmgyXzaa	starbucks|`|Zki0DuLWaa	McDonalds, cheaper and tastes way better!    I'm from Seattle, and I think Starbucks is highly over rated.|`|DoHaUEziaa	Even though Starbucks and Seattle's Best is based in Seattle where I'm from, I prefer Seattle's Best over Starbucks for just a regular cup of coffee. If I want a latte, I make my own. Tastes just like Starbucks and costs MUCH less.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I'll skip them both and go to Dunkin Donuts.  Starbucks coffee is like drinking an ashtray!  If I had to choose between the two you mentioned I'd get a regular coffee at mcD's|`|05d05342b340961643a18c3d866ab89baa	Starbucks coffee is great, but for the price I'll take McDonald's.|`|DsgGSkRcaa	star bucks is better but mcdonalds is cheeper|`|glhfaGDqaa	i like mcdonalds better|`|krNFjnueaa	well starbucks has some good coffe but it cost alot and mcdonalds is getting that new coffe corner thing so im with anyone of the 2|`|5UPL5Rdoaa	STARBUCKS ALL THE WAY|`|PCk2Cfc4aa	I don't like coffee.|`|joHTB4Cjaa	Tim Horton's|`|SfqqhIfjaa	I try to sample all the major coffee chains, some have great stuff, but most are not strong enough, I'm willing to pay 50 cents more to have a drink I can taste the espresso in, rather then save the 50 cents to get a funky drink.    I usually just get brewed coffee, and McD's tastes like coffee-flavored water, and Starbucks gives free refills on coffee!
JyghcEWpaa	Then it wouldn't be Starbucks.  They would become a convince store minus the convince of having all of the additional items.  Everywhere does this.  Think about how many times you went into a gas station with a headache but refused to pay 3.00 for 2 Tylenol because you knew that Walmart sells whole bottles for that?  Starbucks is the coffee depot giving you only a million blends and flavors to choose from while 7-eleven only spits 3 at cha.  People like choices and will pay a little extra to have them.|`|lW2W1ApBaa	How many people doe;s it take to make a cup of coffee?|`|oPRmgyXzaa	that might work, the prices are horrible|`|Kc8sFjwraa	I heard about some of the StarBucks closing    Nevr had there coffee b4
AA10667849	its just a tourist trap  beware|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I personally didn't understand it. I did not enjoy San Fran and felt unsafe and felt it was very dirty.  Its just a tourist town, shops, food, that damn Alcatraz prison and so on.    Sorta like Hollywood.. You know.. all glamed out and then you get there and its dirty with hookers and bums on every corner!|`|4WjZTF1saa	the food there is good but there are way better places to go in san francisco.|`|8dd8e579fd621e4b4affcc8b80072b8caa	Food is real popular. The restaurants have fresh fish they serve. The boats come into the dock and drop off fish everyday. You can even stroll around the area outdoors where they prepare the fish.    Lots of shops to buy souveniers, many restaurants, attractions, Ghiradelli Chocolate Factory, unique shops, the cablecars, and the ships to Alcatraz Island (the prison). You are right on the SF Bay and lots of tourists.|`|RsXOS3aqaa	best clam chowder and sourdough bread bowls haha   other than that...couldnt tell you|`|Cfbn2Lvoaa	its really pretty there and good clam chowder. go to alliottos|`|fVpZARPTaa	Its lively and romantic to say the least.
2idRhSPFaa	Duh!  Thats Freak Nasty with "Da Dip"|`|VXcp8hvHaa	you are a dip|`|UxrC2n9Kaa	Ah man, thanks alot!  I am going to have that song in my head for like two weeks.  It's Freak Nasty's Da Dip.
RsXOS3aqaa	i live in beverly hills and there arent many but there are more closer to hollywood|`|cIgDDmXlaa	there is a lot of clubs for minors in LA...  they're cool   its only like a half hour drive...|`|7YoSRWQEaa	Go to LA, we have a lot.
