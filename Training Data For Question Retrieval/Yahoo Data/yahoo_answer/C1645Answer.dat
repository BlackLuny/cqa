sJqNDYVkaa	From what I know, most towns in the Philippines are named after a saint.  With so many towns, it's quite possible that several feast days are celebrated every month.  A saint's feast day usually coincides with the town's festival.  I suppose there's no one particular month that has the most festivals.  But if I were to guess, I'd pick December or May, which is a summer month in the Philippines.|`|aWZXeJR7aa	may is the month devoted for mary. so many fiestas but really theres festival almost every month in phils.|`|AA11212130	Most of the festivals, in my guess....its around April and May. <br>  <br>  But most of the festivities are in the Christmas season. <br>  <br>  So there...<br>  <br>  =D|`|kWNArHaBaa	i agree! its MAY|`|59K6Dfazaa	May hosts more festivals/fiestas than any other month.<br>  <br>  The month is devoted to the Blessed Virgin and there's a special month long celebration in honor of her. It is called 'Flores de Mayo' where kids offer flowers to her every night. And the 'Santacruzan' to top off the celebration.

I could go on and on and on and on about things you could do in the big city, but I won't, due to a limit of how much I can write. I guarantee you that no matter where you go, you will have a blast, because New York City is one of the best places to visit! I will list for you some fun things that you can do, and I will give you some websites and/or street addresses to some good restaurants, clubs and other fun activities.<br>  <br>  While in New York, I STRONGLY suggest you go to see a fun show called Fuerzabruta in downtown New York. It is very fun! It's almost like a club, but there's no age limit! In the main lobby, there is a bar for refreshments, and there are souvenirs of the show, like little key chains and t-shirts. Here is the official website >>> <a href="http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fuerzabrutanyc.com/</a><br>  <br>  Listed below are some excellent restaurants you should definitely try out.

9d1cb04f2cf649a1dc6fdd65187045d5aa	You could park in one of the suburban Regional Rail lots, take the train down to 30th St, then catch the bus. Your car should be safe in most suburban lots (Oreland, Jenkintown, Coshohocken etc..) But nothings guaranteed. As the other poster said, for Philly parking rates, it isn't bad. They charge nearly $20 just for a couple hours on Fridays & Saturdays..|`|VEi3R0craa	that is great for parking in philly and knowing your car will be safe.

AA12225622	Well if you want a really cheap Wedding just go down to to the County Clerks office, they will do it right there for you.<br>  <br>  Another option for you, and most people do not know about this is, have a close friend get certified to marry you.  <br>  <br>  All your friend has to do is get a license from the County Clerk and then they are good.  I am not sure what the fee is but it is reasonable.  My brother did that for a friend of his.<br>  <br>  Then you could have your wedding in a park, which should not cost a whole lot of money to rent a space.  Make the reception pot luck.  I went to a wedding once that was pot luck and it was a blast.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.

xnVTRGmyaa	I'll give you a list of a few key events to research; but as several have said, there is no short history here; the political situation in Ireland has had about 800 years to become what it is today. These are some of the highlights:<br>  <br>  1168--the King of Leinster (the eastern province of Ireland), Diarmait Mac Murchada, is dethroned by Toirdhealbhach úi Conchobhair. Diarmait solicits help from England's King Henry II to be restored to his throne. Henry sends the Earl Richard de Clare, also known as Strongbow, who is promised land and Diarmait's daughter to marry. This event is where the "800 years of British oppression" figure originates.<br>  <br>  1532--King Henry VIII of England founds the Church of England, with himself as the supreme head of the Church.<br>  <br>  1609--Plantation of Ulster (the northern province) begins. Wealthy English and Scottish landowners, loyal to the Crown, begin to displace the poorer, mostly Catholic population.<br>  <br>  1641-1650--Irish Rebellion of 1641 begins, to remove the wealthy British Protestant landowners from Ireland. England can do little about this, since it is in the grip of its own civil war. The rebellion is eventually crushed by the forces of Oliver Cromwell, who begins a brutal program of oppression of the native Irish population.<br>  <br>  1689--Siege of Derry.<br>  <br>  1690--The forces of the Catholic King James II of England are defeated by those of William of Orange at the Battle of the Boyne. James flees to France. Penal Laws, restricting the legal rights of Catholics, begin to be passed.<br>  <br>  1798--large-scale rebellion of the native Irish population against British rule.<br>  <br>  1801--Act of Union, by which all of Ireland is declared part of the United Kingdom.<br>  <br>  1829--Daniel O'Connell helps bring about Catholic Emanicipation from the Penal Laws.<br>  <br>  1845-1849--the Great Hunger (An Gorta Mór), more commonly known as the Potato Famine. Millions die or emigrate to North America.<br>  <br>  1880-1889--Charles Parnell's Home Rule Movement.<br>  <br>  1916--Easter Rising. Padraig Pearse, in his Proclamation, declares Ireland to be a free nation, independent of British rule. The War for Independence begins.<br>  <br>  1920--The U.K. and Ireland agree to end the conflict, in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which allows 26 of Ireland's 32 counties to be granted the status of the Irish Free State, a member of the British Commonwealth, similar to the status of Canada or Australia. But six counties, of the nine in the northern province of Ulster, will remain part of the U.K., as a statelet to be known as Northern Ireland.<br>  <br>  1921-1922--Civil War in Ireland, as forces of the new Irish Republican Army, who believe that the Treaty wasn't enough--that the conflict must continue until all 32 counties are part of a unified and independent Ireland--clash with those forces of the new Free State, who are prepared to accept the Treaty.<br>  <br>  It is important to understand that Northern Ireland has been British for over two hundred years, since the Act of Union, and that a slim majority is content to let it remain so. There is very much more to the conflict in the 20th and 21st centuries. It is not a matter of the U.K. being "hell-bent on having" the Six Counties--it is a matter of maintaining peace and security in their own territory. It is good to research the matter yourself, with as much objectivity as possible. I have my own sympathies and opinions, based on my research, but as an American, I am fully aware that there is very much I can't directly understand, because I've never lived in Ireland, on either side of the border. Also, we as Americans can't logically take the simple stance of "Brits Get Out!" unless we're prepared to give our land back to the people we took it from as well.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	There is no short story.|`|4VY7u6tNaa	What kind of a narrow minded comment is that??

What a fool. <br>  Anyways, you should check it up on wikipedia, they might have tried to shorten it. (sorry but a**holes with comments like that are just fools)|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	Basically bout half of Northern Ireland are catholics and wanna be seperate from Britain and the other half are protestants who wanna be part of Britain. So really theres no simple answer to it without upsetting one side of the argument. The IRA want to be seperate so throughout the 70's to 90's did a load of terrorist attacks but that has supsided over the past decade so this recent attack is a bit out of the blue. The fact is the protestants in Northern Ireland wanna be part of Britain so it isn't simply a case of England being hellbent on keeping a little bit of Ireland.|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	england took over ireland years ago, they sent over all these soldiers out of prison on the streets of ireland which caused terror for years and years, the british done terrible things to the irish...eventually after all the fighting the british gave back 26 counties and kept 6 they are up in the north,,,the ira are fighting for these countys to be part of ireland,but the prodistants in the north want it to stay england! its so hard to explain but i tired my best|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	The words "short" and "history of the Irish" don't really go together. Read up on the back story of the recent troubles on wikipedia, it will help a lot. There's 800 years of history between the two countries. I don't know where to begin to tell you the truth. Too much to be summed up adequately.|`|7667ba5c043bb1c36a9a5781159bd6e6aa	There is no short history. See William of Orange onwards. Throw in Oliver Cromwell and the potato famine just for starters.<br>  If you are really interested and obviously you are not- information abounds in both libraries and the internet.
MVVQrEasaa	Yep, I've done it, by myself.  It took 16.5 hours total on the interstate with short breaks for bathrooms and gas from Seattle to Sacramento and a slightly longer break for dinner outside of Sacramento.<br>  <br>  Left at 5 AM, arrived at 9:30 PM<br>  <br>  Don't forget that your timing will have you driving through Portland and possibly also Sacramento at rush hour (if you drive on a weekday), which can add to the total time.<br>  <br>  It's technically still winter, and winter driving conditions are possible, especially around the northern California/Oregon border.   So be prepared with supplies (food, water, warm clothing and chains for your car), follow the road conditions as you go, and be prepared to stop if the conditions are poor enough.|`|rjWmooaXaa	It's possible if you're willing to do it.<br>  We did it in 18 hours last year, but that included a little beach picnic in Oregon and a bit of shopping.<br>  <br>  I'd say just bring great music to sing along to, yummy yummy snacks, and plan for a few fun pit stops.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|xjdmXkqHaa	YES. i have driven 21 hrs straight, stopping to gas and restroom breaks.|`|AA12239227	Is it possible?  Yes.<br>  <br>  A friend of mine did it in 14 hours driving pretty fast (70+ mph).  Mapquest doesn't take into consideration stopping for gas and food.  I don't know what kind of car you have, but you will have to stop at least once for gas, if not more.  And your stomach and bladder will need to be attended to at some point.<br>  <br>  If you've never done this before, I wouldn't recommend it.  But it is possible.  You'll just have to fight off boredom and dozing off.  Pull off at rest stops every couple of hours to stretch the legs and get some air.  Also, bring a ton of up beat music to entertain you and keep you awake.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  For more questions and answers, check out <a href="http://experts123.com" rel="nofollow">http://experts123.com</a>|`|R1Aixq3taa	If your willing to you will probably make it|`|DrjpTADaaa	I have done 800+ mile trips by myself alot. First, Get good sleep prior to you leaving. Make sure you have a jug of water, some snacks, and a blanket in case of emergency. Make sure your phone is charged, and even though the police dont like it talk to people you know throughout the day. Keep plenty of music on and if you get tired roll the window down. Stop when you need to and walk around a little before carrying on. Know where upcoming towns and hotels are in case you can not make it. To cut some time eat on the road. Other than that enjoy the drive. I have driven from San Diego to Grants Pass, OR many times (880 miles) and it can get tiring but it is not too much for one person to handle. Good luck|`|cdcc5bd1e7cd458a1cc4a95f146da288aa	yes it is possible...but I would not recommend it. It is approximately 9 hours from SF to Eugene, Oregon.

If its an "indirect signature required" then you can leave a note on the door, or a neighbor can sign|`|ipw5zYZYaa	Many times, you can leave a note for a package to be left at a secure location (such as next door neighbor) AFTER a first attempt has been made to deliver it.  However, for security reasons, the delivering company may not do so.  <br>  <br>  When a note is left at your home regarding a delivery attempt, they usually have a phone number and/or an address where you can pick up the package yourself. <br>  <br>  You can also go to FedEx.com and look in their FAQ. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

pm2EeEgiaa	Because the Philippines were colonized by the USA, everything that they see linked to the US is considered superior. <br>  <br>  The treatment of Whites by Filipinos as superior stems from their 5 century colonization by Whites - first by Portugal (some parts), followed by three centuries of Spain, a 6-year interruption by British, then 50 years of American rule - the status of Whites and half-Whites in the Philippines as a colony was very high than that of the indigenous Malayo-Polynesian or of the immigrant Chinese, Japanese, Indian, or American Indian peoples.<br>  <br>  This has been reinforced by TV shows, which particularly prefer air actors who are obviously of White descent. <br>  <br>  Also, the education of the Philippines has led to the increase of English-speaking rich people (who by the way, are mostly of White descent) - and since the education of the poor people in the provinces tend to be staffed by badly-trained teachers who used Filipino in the classroom - a strata grew - and it divided the Philippines into two countries: the Rich, who are mostly descended from earlier Spanish, American, or Chinese settlers, speak English and another European language or Chinese, and are greatly Americanized, and the Poor, who are mostly indigenous Malayo-Polynesians, speak Philippine languages, and have a culture which is Hispano-Asian. <br>  <br>  Of course, there is no doubt that colonial policies were made to favor the White settlers and their offspring. While White settlement in the Philippines was not as great as that in either America or Australia, it nevertheless made the Philippines as the world's largest Eurasian and Amerasian nation - or having the world's largest population of mixed White and Asian descent. It also has Asia's largest White population.<br>  <br>  There is also the antsy Middle-Class professionals which always tries to reach the "Rich" but are shunned - they have also adopted the English language and lots of cultural values from America but still are not considered as same ranks with the Rich, possibly by virtue of their ancestry - which is mostly either indigenous or mainland Asian with only minimal White admixtures, if any.<br>  <br>  <br>  Most Filipinos don't readily admit it, but social status in the Philippines is nearly entirely based on race, cultural affiliations, and education.|`|oqiw8Ruuaa	excuse me mister,<br>  but i think it's the other way around.<br>  (most) americans are the ones who think they're superior.<br>  <br>  maybe the social climbers and gold diggers<br>  here in the philippines do think that the americans<br>  are the best people in the world --but definitley not all.<br>  <br>  the quality of a person does not depend much<br>  on such cheap talk.<br>  <br>  well somehow, we're also grateful to them<br>  because they helped us in the past.<br>  even so, that's not enough reason to say<br>  that we're nothing but second-rate citizens<br>  compared to them.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	US is one of the super powers in the world aside from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia, to name a few.  English is "superior" because is the International Language.  Wherever you go, you need to speak English. Through this language alone, one can communicate properly even with the aid of an interpreter.|`|ga5YyGJWaa	Well, it started with the Spanish colonization. 300 years of Spanish people making Us, Filipinos feel a tad bit not good enough compared to them. 300 years! Then when we finally decided to fight back and revolt for their all whole freedom, the Americans asked to join in and help us, Who then betrayed them, and tried to take over the country. sad story, but because of losing and being betrayed, they lost hope, and making the American's attempts to take Philippines over much easier, because of the state Filipinos were. And when they took over, they allowed mass education. Public schooling. Where, probably, the brainwashing started. Who could deny the racism colonization brings? IT shoves it in the faces of the people, directly and indirectly. And the mass education made the next generation think the same, whites are superior. I mean, little children are easy to teach. Whether it be good or bad, they have no sense of wisdom as compared to adults.<br>  <br>   Even when the Japanese came, (whom the Americans despised during that time) who, in truth, had better idealizations that the whites(they wanted to drive out ALL western influence and start a NEW Asia, take note tho, they abused their power, if they didn't taint their idealization with their power, well I guess history wouldn't of gone as it does), we despised them, as much as the whites despised them. Even up to now, some people still have prejudices to the Japs, whom I always look up to besides what they've done.<br>  <br>  After all that time under Caucasian people, we started believing that they ARE, better than us. Up to now, society here believes beauty is measured by how white your skin is, and how sharp your nose is. That quality is measure if the product's imported<br>  <br>  IT'S ALL THE AFTER EFFECTS OF COLONIZATION. WE BELIEVED IN OURSELVES JUST BE TO BROUGHT DOWN AGAIN. So we lost faith in ourselves, lost faith in WHO we are. It's a tragic story, a whole free nation, still chained as a dog by America in consumerism. <br>  <br>  <br>  THIS IS COLONIAL MIND SET|`|C5Y7KOghaa	Might be the colonial period where the whites then are the "higher-class" of people while the citizens are second or third class.|`|tUPXslOMaa	It's simply because the Philippines is too subservient to the USA nothing more nothing less and I think it's going to be that way forever.|`|kSt1BI6vaa	Well, they view their lives as inadequate whenever they see all the good things they show on Hollywood movies.|`|Imqb5ueqaa	I am a Filipino<br>  <br>  1. I don't think it is only Filipinos who acknowledge that the USA is superior. The fact is that when USSR disintegrated, the USA became the one and only superpower in the world. Others are powerful, others are trying to catch up. But everyone acknowledges that they are the strongest country in the world politically (the USA election is awaited by the world), economically (they are the world's largest economy) and unmatched in military power.<br>   <br>  1. I don't think the English language is superior. However it is the most convenient because it is the international language of business, and the USA happens to have the largest business interests all over the world.|`|7ONAv4vYaa	Well it is just a matter of opinion.|`|TKHHRUB4aa	United States of America is a super power country and that makes us superior for any country in the world and that is a fact.<br>  <br>  English is the most dominant language used in the entire world. I strongly suggest that you read the rankings of languages used in the world for a reference.<br>  <br>  Filipinos doesn't suppress nor eliminate their own cultural history but are very much glad to embrace changes in society. Culturally speaking, because of inter racial marriages some of the customs and culture beliefs are being incorporated on their daily lives.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Some do, but not all.  They think USA is better but not superior because of their economic stability and political maturity.  English is an international language and is better when communicating, either for cultural or business communications.  Really, how much better it   would be if we have only one language in this world!|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Watch any Filipino soap opera.<br>  We all live in mansions, have maids, butlers and drive BMW's or Mercedes benz's. The view presented to the people here of life in America is so unreal and distorted.

It is not as easy to get a job driving city transit as you might think.  <br>  <br>  If you do manage to get a call, you will be put through a series of written tests before you're even considered for an interview.

Electricity and water costs should be about the same.<br>  I'm not quite sure what the current rental rates are (we're paying off a mortage on a very large old house on acreage) My mother pays $270 a week for a large three bedroom house on a quarter acre in the outer suburbs.<br>  We pay about $300 a week for groceries but that is for a household of eight with a lot of luxury items (chocolate, alcohol- we entertain a lot)<br>  Electricity and phone depends on which company you go with as well, I pay $70 a month for a delux phone and high speed internet package.|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	Brisbane's a great place to live and the weather is better than Townsville's.<br>  <br>  If by 2/2 you mean 2 bedroom/2 bathroom, I think you would be looking at around $350 per week unless you live miles out of the city.<br>  Electricity for the quarter would be around $300 if everything is electric and more if it has aircon.<br>  I don't think you pay for water in an apartment though I may be wrong about that.<br>  Landline phone will be around $95/quarter plus calls<br>  Weekly groceries - that's a hard one and depends very much on your food choices. Say $200 if you're biggish meat eaters and less if you're vegies.|`|U3fwQPcjaa	It really does depend on where in Brisbane you are moving to.<br>  2 bed 2 bath in outer suburbs (i.e. springfield lakes, mt Gravatt, Seventeen Mile Rocks on the South Side and anything in the Pine Rivers way on the North Side) would be around $250-350/week. As you get closer to the city centre the prices go up. My sister lives in Aspley and has a 3 bed 1 1/2 bath and they pay around $400/week and I have friends in Toowong who pay about the same.<br>  Check out:<br>  <a href="http://www.realestate.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.realestate.com.au/</a><br>  Best guess for electricity is $300 per quarter, connection to a land line starts at $30 a week (plus calls on top, Telstra will give you a phone when you connect)<br>  And groceries, well that's a hard one to call, My partner and I spend around $300 a fortnight on food, and it's just the 2 of us.<br>  Although you can save money if you shop for basics at Aldi and get meat from a good butcher (always best option and better quality) and fresh produce from green grocer.<br>  Good Luck, feel free to email me if you wish, I've lived in Bris my whole life and lived in a number of suburbs too if you want more info.
Zp1IocEBaa	wellll<br>  <br>  i moved to chicago from europe 10 years ago so here you go...<br>  <br>  1. my parents came here because they wanted a better future for me ( i am 19 now so basically they wanted me to go a good college)....another reason is that i first moved to austria after fleeing the war in bosnia in late 1991 and we were going to be considered immigrants/refugees there forever so my parents wanted us to come here so we can be citizens<br>  <br>  2. well i first came to chicago to visit before i moved here and that i can tell you was amazing....well for me at least. i mean i was 7 but i thought it was the best thing that had ever happened to me because i had never before seen as big of a city and so many buildings...but now its quite normal :)<br>  <br>  3. language was the first thing....i came here without knowing a word of english....anything at all and it was the most embarassing feeling to have someone talk to you and you just sitting there staring because you have no idea what they are saying and i kind of feel like the other kids at school made fun of me for it....but what can you do. another struggle was definitely money.....we didnt really have much when we came here but we kept pushing and came pretty far since then. <br>  <br>  4. life is wayyyyyy different in europe than it is here. i go back to europe twice a year and i can tell you that everything is sooo much more relaxed. time passes by so quickly here and it is always the same thing. another thing is just a day to day lifestyle. i know here i wake up early to go to school and i hate it, then i go to work right after school, then come home, do a couple of things here and there and that is it. while i am in europe though, everyone has time for everything, wether they work or not. i know my friends and i always wake up early, meet at the bar for coffee and actually enjoy it. i dont hate waking up early while i am there. and then there is always something to do. barbequeing by the river or at someones house, going rafting, going shopping. and the whole going out at night is very different as well. it is not some random high school party where you are in someones basement drinking out of big red cups. we go to the bar and yeah we have a couple of drinks, but its not to get wasted or anything....its just....normal lol......<br>  <br>  <br>  wellll there you go lol i hope that answers your questions....<br>  i know its a lot....but you cant really talk about something like that without giving a good amount of information <br>  i hope it helps :D
kgBPU4xxaa	April through the middle of June is usually very nice here in Italy. The tourist crowds pick up mid- June and it can be very hot here through the summer. However, the prices generally go up for travel toward the end of March. Prices for hotels here can vary a lot depending on exactly where you are and what's going on. I stayed in a hotel just off Piazza San Marco in Venice for the first weekend of Carnevale for 150 euro per night. The next weekend, the same place was going for 400 euro per night. The next weekend when Carnevale had ended, the price was 80 euro per night. Another good time is after the tourist peak - September through mid-October.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	You want to see 7 countries in 30 days?!?!?!  You are crazy!  You need a week for London, a week for Paris, and at least a month for Greece!  <br>  <br>  Okay, maybe not QUITE so long, esp. the Greece thing...I don't think I could do it in less.  But seriously...think about that...make yourself a daily itinerary and see if you REALLY can jack that much into a month!  I think you are overdoing it!  Remember, you need time to travel between cities, and it looks like you think each country only has one city!  You're wrong!<br>  <br>  April is a terrific month for the South, but I would think it might still be a bit chilly in the northern countries...England, Northern Germany...Then again...there will be fewer tourists there, so lines will be shorter, crowds will be down.<br>  <br>  Plan your time well, and you'll do okay...but remember travel time, too.|`|KLcYnz1laa	I am doing a Topdeck tour for 47 days through western europe.

kGkUG0fKaa	well I have taken to long raodtrips, none for nine days and even though we planned them out, things never went accordingly so the first thing to do is be prepared for mishaps. bring a lot of snacks because there may not be a lot of stops on certain roads for miles. have a lot of entertainment to keep you busy, take pictues and such, you know. the on thing that made our roadtrips fun were the random stops in cities. to check out the scenery and tourist attractions. sleeping in hotels can be pricey even with the cheaper ones so plan it out where you atleast would stop every other night as you planned to sleep in hotels but, map it out first so you can find the cheapest places.<br>  <br>  have fun...........|`|gAV1nZymaa	I've travelled so many places, including Europe, since I was a younggirl...so, i all depends on the scenery you're looking forward to exploring....the trip from (I live in NY now) PA to places like BC in Canada, it's beautiful there! But I don't recommend going through states such as Kansas, Oklahoma etc b/c they're pretty flat plainish areas that have tornadoes and such during the upcoming seasons...however, a trip up through the higer New Eng states should rock this time of year! Best of luck on your venture!!|`|T8W2EZiwaa	I used to own a Ford Conversion Van myself and took many long road trips in it.  It's great for what you are doing.  You could certainly spend the night in it, but be safe, probably worth at least staying at a camp ground.  I like warm weather, so I would head immediately South.  Gulf Shores, Alabama is nice.  White beaches, and fairly cheap.  Of course this time of year the only sure bet for warm weather is South FL.  Have fun.|`|dlh1MV7Daa	This is most fun, just go whatever to the west and it's will be fun !!! If I would be you I'll go to California, and travel all that state from South to North and then go home.

I've seen the Passion Play, its good but get a good seat or you can't see much. There's a mansion to tour and next door another mansion with exotic birds. That's pretty neat but was closed last summer. The botanical gardens is awesome. I've had a massage and spa treatment at the Crescent hotel. It was wonderful and it's fun to just go see the hotel/stay there. It has plenty of interesting history.<br>  If you like German food, go eat at the Bavarian Inn, its sooo good!<br>  For less expensive meals, try Bubba's BBQ or The Pied Piper downtown.<br>  I haven't been to Branson that much but Silver Dollar city is a must of course.

Then, there's the incessant partying and get-togethers; some days you'd rather just stay put in one place and relax by your lonesome self.

However, if it's wildlife you're interested in, the parts of Africa with the most wildlife are East and South Africa, and they are almost impossible to get to from West Africa without flying (look at the countries you would have to cross - Sudan or DR Congo, etc.).<br>  <br>  The best party scenes on the European backpacker circuit are Amsterdam, Barcelona, Prague, and the island of Ios in Greece.

It's actually the town of two sunsets. You can watch the sunset from the beach, then walk up top (there are stairs all along the beach) and watch the ENTIRE sunset again.

The Menesetung bridge/trail goes over it and should be really nice this time of year and gives you a GREAT view.(that bridge is really long and high though this is from higher up and far away.. likely a park at the top) --> <a href="http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/510265.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photo...</a> .. You can visit Tiger Dunlop's tomb just off the trail which is actually very historic and appearently an ancient native burial ground as well. <br>  You could even rent a boat from the marina if you wanted and eat fresh caught fish at the restaurant on the beach. You can even get tugboat tours. The harbour and salt mine are interesting if you like boats, you can go out onto the pier and watch huge ships come in. (this is the salt mine/ edge of the harbour.. .though there isn't a ship in on the pic) -> <a href="http://www.canada-photos.com/data/media/7/industrial-businesses_769.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.canada-photos.com/data/media/...</a><br>  There is also the square which is really interesting for someone who has never been there. It's like a big octogon you can drive around continuously (if wanted), with 8 roads coming off of it. There are stores around the outside, and the county courthouse/park in the middle, like a giant roundabout (top view) -> <a href="http://geography.uwo.ca/maplibrary/images/ortho_samples/swoop_2006.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://geography.uwo.ca/maplibrary/image...</a> ... Most of the stores are independent, there are cafe's, antique shops, boutiques, galleries and many other stores. It's great for a walk around.<br>  <br>  There is tons of other stuff too, but I won't go into detail unless you are interested..

You have a choice of accepting and practicing on your mettle by deliberately twisting the truth or you can choose not to accept and instead find a way to have your evidences presented in court for the sake of justice. It is true that so many lawyers are in it for the money, whether they are convinced of the defendant's guilt or innocence does not matter, it is the pride of winning in the deliberations and the hefty sum that they will be receiving if they do have the upper hand in the case that matters most for them..<br>  <br>  But if the lawyer is appointed by virtue of his position to represent the defendant, then he will have to do his job.  We will then have to pray that the opposing lawyer would be as good as to unearth also those solid evidences that would nail the head of the child rapist.|`|BCstOBfyaa	i worked in a legal firm once and as a lawyer you can take up the case or you can drop it ...the decision is yours..but if you are a doctor you don't have a choice as you are playing with someone's life but as a lawyer you know that person is guilty and you are trying to fight and show people that the person is innocent is plain sinful.

Bush or some other mass murderer.|`|ZNnC1qEyaa	I guess I'd have to if it was my job but I wouldn't be able to sleep to well at night.|`|FzV8hJ62aa	u can't choose if u are a lawyer|`|1883c5fc2b5eec0316820a2092fac7caaa	still no money to buy clothes eh?|`|YRGlM0J1aa	rationally, yes. and yes. and yes. for money, for fame and what have you.<br>  <br>   too much to discuss i think im going to lose track. but hey, i'll talk about whatever that comes to mind.<br>  <br>  to answer your question though... <br>  yes even after "i have unearthed..... suspect". and<br>  yes... i would "mitigate .... behalf" and<br>  yes... even if he comes admit to me he did it.<br>  all are, so to speak my duties to my client & professionalism.<br>  <br>  1. the fact that my client did do it does not necessarily mean he should be punished. involuntary intoxication and mistake as to age can to some extent mean he should not be punished at law. does my client had the intention to do what he did and against the person's will? <br>  <br>  2. of course if he admits the act and intention, my duty as his lawyer will mean i have to give advice that serves his interests best. guilty plea is probably the first way i'd go. my view is, im not a very smart person, if i could unearth the evidence, so can the prosecution. afterall a wise criminal lawyer should know you can almost always strike a deal with the prosecution for lighter sentences in exchange for a guilty plea. my duty to my client is served, so is my duty of candour to court. <br>  <br>  true, lawyers cant present information in court which is known to be untrue. but lawyers can "hide" the information from appearing in court. it probably isnt that hard consider that the burden is on prosecution to prove their case. not me to disprove their case, if you know what i mean. silence can sometimes be good "defence" :)<br>  <br>  i dont agree that lawyers cannot drop a case "just because i am so judgmental".  can a lawyer act on emotions? h*ll yes! lawyers are human too, arent you? of course should you decide not to accept the matter, you are bound by a-z principles not to disclose any information that is detrimental to your ex-client's case. which principle says you cant refuse acting because you dont like your client, may i ask??<br>  <br>  for all i care, lawyers can stop refuse case or stop acting if prospective client is poor or ugly. what's the biggie with if i predetermined him to be a criminal. lol lawyers dont do charity when it comes to work, okies<br>  <br>  IN practice though, up to stage two and my advice wasnt accepted, i think i will stop acting. not because i think he is a bad guy, but rather i know im not good enough and he deserves a better defence lawyer :) so i would definitely refer him to some other lawyer.|`|PQb9MU4gaa	Yes. Because lawyers have to be professional. Not emotional. That makes them different and cursed by the public. Let the law decide whether the alleged rapist is guilty or not. Sometimes we can't see the real image of something because we are influenced by emotion.<br>  <br>  A doctor has to do his best to save a badly injured robbers just to make sure justice will be done accordingly. <br>  <br>  A judge can't punish an alleged criminal just because he believe such person is guilty but he must support his decision with authority and evidence.<br>  <br>  Do you think Malik Imtiyaz is non-Muslim since he represented Lina Joy in her fight to declare that she is no longer Muslim? Do you think Malik Imtiyaz is a bad guy? since Islam prohibits apostasy. My answer is No. Malik Imtiyaz in his professional duty must represent his client (Lina Joy) when appointed to do so and the issue of morality does not involved here because one faith do not reflect the other.<br>  <br>  People can say what they want to say about lawyers. We don't blame them since public can't understand the real term of humanity and justice.<br>  <br>  --------------<br>  <br>  I pity those who claims that their lawyer friend or family said that "lawyer has to lie in court" ... what a funny remark. Lawyers are guided by Legal Profession (Practice & Etiquette) Rules.  A lawyer won't ask his client "Did you really commit the murder/rape/robbery?" That's  unethical (and of course stupid ... and if your friend said that to you ... i'm sorry but your friend is stupid and incompetent lawyer. You will stuck in court if you decided to lie. A liar won't success in court.<br>  <br>  Normally a lawyer will ask the client "Where were you in that particular time?" ... "what do you do?" ... bla bla ... just to get the fact. From the facts given a lawyer will submit to court and justify it with law ... and the JUDGE will decide.<br>  <br>  Lawyer can't create evidence. If a murderer escaped punishment in court, it's not because of the 'great lawyer' but merely a loop hole in law. <br>  <br>  For those who mentioned that 'lawyer can drop case' ... yeah they can ... with good reasons. For example "the client refuse to cooperate, lost contact,  if professional conduct likely to be impugned, if difficult to maintain professional independence, if unable to appear etc NOT BECUASE YOU ARE SO JUDGMENTAL and believe that the accused is guilty.<br>  <br>  Lawyers are required to conduct their case with condour, courtesy and fairness. Do more research dude.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  Yeah lawyer has the right to choose case. However don't stuck your brain with that statement. How do you know what kind of case the man is having if you decided not to accept it on the first place? ... example: the accused's family came to a lawyer and said that his son has been charged with rape. Only a moron will say ... "oh i can't accept it because i don't represent criminals" ... gosh ... how do you know the guy really committed the crime? .... the acceptable reason to refuse such cases are ... "we don't do criminal cases (only civil or conveyancing), we can't accept more briefs since we have to many cases to handle at the moment, we are expert in particular law (Intellectual property law, insurance etc) ... "<br>  <br>  Therefore i can't understand why people keep on saying ... "That lawyer is bad because he represent bad guy or criminals ..." If this is the level of thinking for Malaysians ... I say ... "May God has time to Bless You" ...|`|ibnB6HrGaa	Being a lawyer is quite a hard profession. They are required to lie, but lie in a smart way, for their client. <br>  There are many kind of laws that one can practice. But criminal law is different, there is a clause which allow them to withdraw if they, the defense lawyer, have undisputed evidence to convict their own client.<br>  However, this kind of luxury only reserved for the Partner of the firm where they have the right to choose which case they WANT to take. Other than that the small lawyer will just have to grow a thick skin and try to earn a place in the office and go home with no job.

I would look into Aquatica, or if you can, try Typhoon lagoon|`|nlRr07dRaa	aquatica! <br>  <br>  aquatica has a huge kids area that will entertain him for hours... there's two lazy rivers one with rapids (they provide life jackets) it's really fun and kids enjoy it. and the other goes past a freshwater fish tank and the dolphin tank.... if you want to ad a little of an educational aspect to it and see some creatures probably never seen before I would recomend aquatica.... did i forget to mention the water is heated all year long to a sexy 84 degrees..<br>  <br>  ...as for Blizzard Beach, it's a wonderfull park, most of the attractions are for older kids. it's disney so they have a hell of a presentation to make you think it's snow and all. you almost forget you're in florida.|`|sCIoj3yxaa	Aquatica is OK.  I would say Typhoon Lagoon is the way to go!!

zmqN0M86aa	I just booked a week long honeymoon at Sandals Dunn's River a few months ago.  Before I did, I checked out multiple reviews online of the various Sandals in Jamaica.  I found that a lot of people say that the Montego Bay resort is kind of older than the other ones and that they have not been keeping up with it as much as they should.  They also said that it's very close to the airport and you'll constantly hear airplanes coming and going.  I read mostly good reviews about Dunn's River, that's why I picked it.  From what I read, Sandals Whitehouse is supposed to be really good too.  I suggest going to various travel sites like Orbitz, Travelocity, Expedia, etc. and read the reviews about all of the different Sandals.  Hope this helps.
2dWlUEimaa	Mariekat is heading in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Technically you don't have an automatic right to obtain a Greek passport. To get a Greek passport you must have Greek citizenship. As the daughter of a Greek who was born in Greece, however, you do have the right to claim Greek citizenship through your Greek ancestry.<br>  <br>  In short, you can get a Greek passport, but only after you have gotten your Greek citizenship.<br>  <br>  Regarding how to obtain Greek citizenship by claim of Greek origin: <a href="http://livingingreece.gr/2007/07/09/acquiring-greek-citizenship-by-foreign-nationals-of-greek-origin/" rel="nofollow">http://livingingreece.gr/2007/07/09/acqu...</a><br>  <br>  Regarding how to obtain your Greek passport: <a href="http://livingingreece.gr/2007/05/01/how-to-get-the-new-greek-passport/" rel="nofollow">http://livingingreece.gr/2007/05/01/how-...</a><br>  <br>  As Mariekat states in her answer, you need to contact the Embassy (or one of the consulates) of Greece in Australia. A little more info on the Greek passport (info from the Greek consulate in Sydney): <a href="http://greekconsulate.org.au/catalog.php?id=583" rel="nofollow">http://greekconsulate.org.au/catalog.php...</a>|`|YU471WSsaa	markerat and chris..are mostly right.. but your best deal is to get to the greek embassy  if your in sydney as iam they are in  castelragh  st. they listed int he tel:book.. just make an apoitnment take all ur brith certificates,,and any thing that claims ur an australian citizen.. even telephone or electricity bills ..they can also establish that you are acitizen.. futher more the greek goverment may need proof of you fathers birth..but when u make ur appointment they should tell u every thing.. what u need to brign to get ur process going for your passport.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	If you can prove that you are Greek by blood,then you can.<br>  I mean, if your dad is Greek (no matter his passport/citizenship) then you can get the Greek citizenship and therefore the Greek passport/ID.<br>  <br>  That will help you to move freely through Shengen countries,without need of Schengen visa.|`|BJ0kC81saa	If your dad was born in Greece you're eligible for a Greek Passport.<br>  I would contact the Greek embassy in your state, they deal with these things all the time and will give you the necessary details and paper work.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  even though your dad is an Australian citizen you can still get a Greek passport. My grandparents were born in Greece and moved to Australia (so became Australian citizens). My dad was born in Australia and he got a Greek passport. So you should have no problem at all. Apparently even someone like myself (whose parents were born here) can get a Greek passport easily.<br>  <br>  I still recommend you see the Greek embassy/consulate in your state. There's an office in every state. Some people below have given some details as to where they are.

q84KT11saa	There is lots of work still available.  It is just wise to do some research ahead of time as the hiring process might take a little while.

DUOoMBqoaa	There will be tons of maps at the hotel. You can catch the ferry to the Statue of Liberty in Battery Park, the bottom tip of Manhattan. Make sure not to confuse it with the STATEN ISLAND ferry, although, if it's a nice day, it can be a nice ride, but it will take an hour round trip.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend you plan on visiting some of the main museums. The MET is my favorite, it is extraordinary.<br>  Also, make sure you see a show of some kind depending on what music you are into. The arts in NYC are world class and one of the things I miss most about the city.<br>  Finally, unless you are planning on going to a top rated restaurant, don't be afraid to walk around an eat at restaurants that appeal to you. Oftentimes, positive reviews are posted in the windows of some of the better spots, but overall, most places to eat are very good and there is a ton of variety.<br>  Have a great time!|`|qEn157Ppaa	No worries, your hotel concierge can offer help in getting those places.<br>  You should be able to take a ferry to the Statue of Liberty. Also, try www.about.com and type in the search box the things you are interested in. that site helps me all the time. <br>  I was just in NYC and can recommend The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Museum of Natural History, too. All great for rainy day ideas, so keep those in mind even if you are not into that type of thing. You won't regret it.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Simply go to mapquest.com  and you can walk from Times Square to the Empire State building, it's a nice little walk, actually 8 blocks and a few avenues, east and Wellllllllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaa you're at the Empire State Building and I would get a Metro card and travel by subway anywhere I wanted to go instead of a tour company, it's much more fun!!!|`|paHjJrrdaa	Yes, take the subway.

cWuumdy7aa	sun temple is at konark near Puri in Orrisa. its one of the tourist attraction .Konark ( is a small town in Puri district of the state of Orissa, India, on the Bay of Bengal, sixty-five kilometres from Bhubaneswar. It is the site of the 13th-century Sun Temple (also known as the Black Pagoda), built in black granite by King Narasimhadeva I (AD 1236-1264) of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The temple is a World Heritage Site. It takes the form of the chariot of Surya (Arka), the sun god, and is heavily decorated with stone carving. The entire complex was designed in the form of a huge chariot drawn by seven spirited horses on twelve pairs of exquisitely decorated wheels. The entrance is guarded by two lions, which are each shown crushing a war elephant. Each elephant in turn lies on top of a human body. The temple symbolises the majestic stride of the Sun god. At the entrance of the temple is a Nata Mandir. This is where the temple dancers used to perform dances in homage to the Sun god. All around the temple, there are various floral and geometric patterns. There are also human, divine and semi-divine figures in sensuous poses. The poses contains couples in various amorous poses, and are derived from the Kama Sutra. The temple is now partly in ruins, and a collection of its sculptures is housed in the Sun Temple Museum, which is run by the Archaeological Survey of India. The poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote of Konark: "here the language of stone surpasses the language of man."<br>  <br>  Konark is also home to an annual dance festival, held every December, devoted to classical Indian dance forms, including the traditional classical dance of Orissa, odissi.<br>  <br>  On February 16, 1980, Konark lay directly on the path of a total solar eclipse.<br>  <br>  Konark beach is a popular tourist destination, though the waters are deceptively calm.

It was there!

f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	No. Movies are over the top and dramatic. Who would watch a movie about everyday life? Everyday life is dull.<br>  <br>  The US is not a dangerous place. Crime rates have been dropping nationally for years - though the gun statistics are high, generally that is criminals killing other criminals. Regular life is very normal and safe.You have to ignore half of what the media says about the US. Bad news always is hyped up over the good. I have lived in several US cities that have been portrayed as very violent in movies. I am a rather small woman and I have never even seen a gun in my life other than on a policeman (not in use) and I have never been victim of a crime.

And as somebody told you before, the burj dubai is tall very tall but still a lot of room to reach heaven.|`|hMTL2AV7aa	Those kind of racist ideas are found in Zionist literature , they make all kind of ridiculous racist claims about Ham only because his descendants are black, basically all subsaharan Africa. On the other hands Arabs (which you think you were referring to) are Semitic not Hamitic, including entire north Africa and Iberia who all originate from the same ancestry. So your point is moot . <br>  The idea of building a tower to heaven was some thing a guy called Haman (not Ham) was doing on orders of the Pharaoh, who later died in the red sea. This happened thousands of years ago , look it up in the Quran,  and it has no connotation with Dubai or Arabs. Burj Dubai is a commercial property , it has no political or religious purpose.<br>  So Dubai is not doing the same thing , and being a Muslim is a very beautiful thing because Muslims don't carry racist ideas such as what you are saying. The answer why we have many races  is also found in the Quran and it has nothing to do with cursing people for their race or color ; that is a purely zionist idea.<br>  <br>  Whatever you realized is wrong , and has no basis on accurate historical or scientific facts. By the way the tower of Babel still stands , so what does that prove to ya.|`|AA10523012	The building of the Burj Dubai does not have any religious aspects.

srp02clAaa	It happened on one of my girl friend when she was eating alone in an eatery in the neighborhood, along came this familiar bystander and she asked him "kain tayo". Usually this phrase is just one of our great "hospitable acts" that even though we really don't mean it we would actually and automatically say it to someone who came in. So this bystander didn't even refused, he ordered something for himself and told the cashier to charge it to my friend! So she was shocked and nothing to do about it but to pay.|`|AA10778446	no, i would never say anything that i don't mean.  and i would not harbor any bad feelings for someone who partakes some or may be all of my food. it is given that the invitation kain tayo should not be taken too seriously and as for most people they would excuse themselves and say that either they are not hungry or else that they had just had their meal, even if that is untrue. but for someone who actually takes you on that offer, they truly are hungry so i would never regret inviting them to join me in a meal.  but of course, that goes without saying that i won't invite someone who appears to be present every mealtime. once, you're hungry, come have a meal with me. twice? excuse me, you're here again? come join me. thrice??? i'm going to charge you for your meal this time!|`|y3dFZt0caa	This hasn't happened to me yet, but I think It begs the opportunity to pull a delightful food prank that would result in an explosive, sometimes, gritty epilogue to your guest's meal that cannot be outdone by after dinner mints.<br>  <br>  Now, I would pay to see that ;P|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	Yes. nag-take home pa.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	In my case, I really reserve extra plate or extra money for the late comers.

kjB4jLcxaa	It depends on the category I'm guessing.  <br>  <br>  I was in the U.S. Army from 2001-2005, 02-05 in Korea.  Out of my whole company, (there were 75 of us, no women, infantry) only 3 of us married a Korean.  Most of the other guys were married to an American already or were only here for a year.  (not enough time to get going in a relationship)  However, almost every single guy (single, sometimes even married) had at least one experience with a Korean girl.  We were in Camp Casey, about 30 KM north of Seoul.  So that should tell you in the Yongsan area it's gotta be happening.  Usually when most Koreans ask me how I met my wife, I always ask them, "well what do you think."  Almost 90% of them say, oh maybe Itaewon or some garbage like that.  Well, I met mine in church....lolz<br>  <br>  So I guess that calculates out to however many male GI's are in Korea.  So hmmm, about 19,000 Korean sluts?  At least that's what all the Korean men, and old women here think.<br>  <br>  I've worked with quite a few foreigners since my tenure of English teaching began in '05.  Most of the men that had been here for over a year and were over the age of 30 tied the knot.  I would have to say 100% of all the guys I worked with, my age or younger, had a few dates or a serious relationship with a Korean female once since they've been here. (minus 1 gay guy I worked with)  Most of the guys that are only interested in staying for a 1 year contract don't tie the knot...<br>  <br>  It's funny these days, if you check out some of the resumes on pusanweb.com, worknplay.com, or any of those other sites...you'll see quite a few guys that say they have the F2 visa.  (spousal visa)  I have to say though, I see VERY few foreign females here with the same status.  I usually only see some filipina, and really old women that claim to have the F2.  (we already know why most of the filipina women get the F2, they''ll get the F5 in less then 2 years)<br>  <br>  Anyways, this is the usual.|`|05HY0oScaa	I agree, my Korean girlfriend told me Korean girls would like me if I would come.<br>  Telling the trtuh, I don't know if she is my girlfriend, we have probems recnelty, but anyway she said so.<br>  or other Korean woman told me that she likes Black people, because she listens to Black music, and she would liek to have a Black boyfriend.|`|4oTjF1zFaa	nobody knows but a lot of couples are there for sure because you meet american girl when you are in america, you meet spanish girl when you are in spain, you meet japanese girl when you are in japan.<br>  etc etc|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	I am not certain.

First, you posted on the wrong category. Second, I find it hard to believe that someone who knows how to use a computer, has an internet connection, and knows how to use Yahoo! Answers can't even figure out how to copy files from an external hard disk to a PC.<br>  <br>  OK, I changed my mind. I'll try my best:<br>  <br>  A modern external HDD can be connected to a PC by using a USB cable. If you don't know what a USB cable is, God help you. Err, I mean look it up on the internet. It's not a normal USB cable by the way; if it came with the HDD, it usually has 3 ends: 1 small end (called mini USB) and 2 larger ends (normal USB). The small end goes in the HDD while one of the larger ends that go along the length of the wire goes to your PC's USB port. The other larger end is for auxilliary power. The HDD usually has a light that tells if power from the USB connection itself is not enough to maintain a data stream. In this case, insert the other larger end to another USB port. You don't normally have to do this, however.<br>  <br>  If your PC does not have a USB port, that means you need to either upgrade your PC or buy an expansion card with USB ports on it.<br>  <br>  Once connected, the OS (Windows XP in this case) will automatically detect the new hardware and install the appropriate drivers. You will then be able to explore the drive via Windows explorer like a normal drive. Don't worry, you'll know what to do when you get there. Just copy and paste whatever you want and you're done. To copy the files to a blank DVD, just right click on a folder or file then click Send To -> DVD RW Drive (If you DO have a DVD RW drive. Otherwise, you need to buy and install one). This does not burn the DVD immediately. Rather, it queues the selected file(s) for burning. When you're ready to burn, click the DVD drive itself on Windows Explorer and there will be an option there to finally burn the files on the DVD. Make sure you have a blank disk in the drive.<br>  <br>  ** What I Think Happened **<br>  People don't usually know how to properly unmount secondary memory, be it solid-state or external HDD. They just pull the cable out, that's it. Most of the hardware I've seen can elegantly handle this situation, and they still get detected by the OS each and every time. However, I've also seen hardware that can't handle such abuse. They just cease to function when the cable gets pulled out.<br>  <br>  For windows, the proper way to unmount secondary memory is to right click the icon on the system tray that appears when you plug in the memory stick or whatever, then click "safely remove hardware". THEN you can pull out the device safely.<br>  <br>  You probably connected the drive at some point in your life and then removed the cable without unmounting the drive first, potentially damaging it. One way to fix this is to connect the drive to another PC then unmount it properly with the procedure just described.

From there rent a car and drive to some of the Keys of Florida.  <br>  DO NOT get involved with alcoholic beverages or drugs, in order to realize the most from your trip and bring back vivid memories that are not dulled by drugs and liquor.    Visit places of historical interest and you will have a trip to remember forever.  Sample the fishing, snorkeling, saililng and surfing.   But don't waste money on gambling, smoking, drinking and other destructive activities.   Make it pleasantly memorable.

AIrPtuDUaa	You'll love Chicago. There's so much to do here. You'll never get bored. Well anyway, you should go downtown and just walk around and enjoy the scenery. You can also go to the metromix website and pick Chicago as your location. Here you'll find out about all the cool stuff going on in Chicago. You'll find the best restaurants, parties, and events to go to. Good Luck!|`|bcTErNF6aa	Cool / just be careful lot of con art ice also nice people be smart go Down Town have fun great food too.|`|eqaUMrYZaa	Stay Downtown in the Loop area ,you will be fine. It is safe down there.|`|AA10349376	The best way to get around would be by public transportation, since parking meter fares are through the roof, especially downtown. So get a map and a bus card. Everyone goes to Millenium Park, Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, and all that stuff. You can't miss them. You should check out some of the other museums too. The museum of science and industry is a great one. Chicago is very diverse too. Go to Greek Town, Chinatown, and Pilsen (Mexican neighborhood), and visit the restaurants there.
PQJyaFDXaa	Jet lag is really about changing your sleep patterns.  When you're in a new time zone, you're suddenly sleeping at vastly different times.  I've also found travelling East to West (America to Thailand) to be much easier than West to East (Thailand to America.)  I've attributed this to the fact that as you travel West, you get more daylight, and it is easier to stay awake during the day.  By the time you sleep, you just get a full night's rest, and you're prevented from oversleeping by more daylight.<br>  <br>  Heading East is harder because you lose time.  The first night you're trying to sleep before you need it.  Then you can't sleep, and by the time it's morning you haven't slept much yet, and have to be tired all day.<br>  <br>  Other factors than the direction you're flying include how accustomed you are to changing your sleep patterns.  I once had a job where I jumped shifts a lot.  I might work days one week, nights another, and swing shifts (midnight to 8) on a third week.  When I had that job and then flew anywhere, I never had jet lag (because my body was used to making extreme shifts in sleeping.)<br>  <br>  Other factors are age (younger people have an easier time with jetlag) and health (if you're feeling under the weather, jetlag is worse.  In fact, jetlag makes you more susceptible to colds.)  Stress can also play a part.  If there's other things going on in your life, a lack of sleep introduced by environmental factors (aka jetlag) does not help.

There is so much to do there I couldn't tell you because I just went to sea-world and disney..|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	tell mickey mouse I said hi. and for more information just google the city and state. you should also google the events in the area.|`|cQoNzj5Gaa	Cool, meet ya up in there.|`|qJCgI0Paaa	I go there every summer. Busch Gardens in Tampa absolutely. Ride SheiKra: Make sure you get in the front row -- the wait is worth it. Universal and Islands of Adventure are great, too. If budget and time allows, check out SeaWorld. Disneyland not so much, but MGM studios is my personal favorite :)|`|m057VroWaa	go to Busch Gardensss, love that place<br>  Wet n Wilds really fun to. <br>  Hopefully yur into that stuff cause thats the main attraction in that city lol|`|EMYImof1aa	Disney World!!!!!!!!!! universal studios! sea world!|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	make sure you go before hurricane season. search google / florida / attractions. there is plenty to see and do in florida that people either don't know about or never spent time doing the research to find out about / learn.  florida has : rodeos, manatees, hot springs, deep sea fishing, scuba diving, disneyland, miles of beaches that tourists rarely see along beaches in smaller cities. venice, fla has a natural ocean current that deposits lots of shark teeth on it's beaches and sand dollars are common. to really see florida avoid the big tourist attractions rent an RV and stop in every little town you come to. meet the locals see were they like to eat, were they hang out and what they enjoy doing.
KNi7gCMpaa	Depends on what you like to eat. If you shop & get the things YOUR familiar with, you'll pay twice what your used to...but the local food will fill ya too. A beef pattie will cost J$80, or roughly US$1.00. Two of those & a soda will be J$250. The jerk chicken & pork are not better deals than Burger King by the time you add in a drink.<br>  <br>  Exchnge rate varies on where you buy it ( cambios ) but its right at 87-1|`|oukdaIVUaa	I been there a few times they use us money and the prices are similar to ours in the us for food and lodging they have all incusives resorts which are the better way to go sense it can be dangerous there. Dont just go out and drive around.Make sure you are with someone who knows the country. have fun...Ricks cafe has some of the best chicken..nice spot also. the falls are nice there to climb|`|wmTIreY0aa	It really depends on where you eat.  If you get "off the beaten path" and eat where the locals eat it will only cost you a few dollars(USD).  If you eat at a fancy restaurant you will pay high prices like anywhere else in the world.  At a roadside stand you can pay a little over a USD for a beer and at a bar you can pay $2.00- over $5.00. <br>  <br>  What you eat also makes a big difference, if you eat a meal that consists of mostly food that is grown or raised on the island it will be much cheaper than imported food.  <br>  <br>  In reference to the exchange rate, it was around 1usd=70 Jamaican when I was there in the fall but now it's around 1=90!   Someone I know just came back last week, I'll see if she can post on your question about what she paid or you can ask her at (view source).|`|sAYu1JNDaa	in jamaican dollars,<br>  <br>  1)KFC, BK and other fast food restaurants a meal for 1 is $300-$500<br>  2)Other places like Rick's cafe, Jerk centres, and other restaurants etc, may cost more. $400-$700|`|Vx9xpDZoaa	2546798479411978946798646981187895614687...<br>  <br>  maybe more idk|`|vNRNjiZOaa	a lot of money|`|4FZRkoFUaa	Yea the dollar is changing rapidly.  I was there twice last year, the last time in Dec and I was getting 70 JMD on the dollar.  Now its over 80.<br>  <br>  Stick to "off the beaten path" like Mr.Windows just said.  Some of the BEST food comes from the street vendors and tiny food places.  <br>  <br>  Also a tip....if you act like you know what you're doing you get things cheaper (unless there's a posted menu price).|`|rxFwxLq9aa	Keep in mind that it's like 70 Jamaican dollars to 1 US dollar.  Spending 15 USD is the equivilent of spending over $1000 JMD.
CwrayzxBaa	Why Australia Day should stay the same:<br>  <br>  Its in the middle of Summer which is perfect for outdoor activities like barbecues and a game of cricket with the family.   <br>  <br>  We have a long tradition of having it on that day.<br>  <br>  Federation day is on New years day and that is already taken, so we might just as well keep this one.<br>  <br>  Changing the day might clash or bring it too close to other national or state public holidays or put it in the dead of winter where celebrating would be difficult.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why Australia Day should change:<br>  <br>  Every other independent country celebrates their national day on the day they became a country.    Australia celebrates on the day some foreign country decided to build a maximum security prison.<br>  <br>  The celebrations focus on Sydney and not the nation.  Outside of Sydney nobody really cares, its just another holiday.<br>  <br>  The day celebrates the founding of the colony of New South Wales. This means that the western third of the continent is completely excluded from the celebrations. While most of the modern states were carved out of New South Wales, one was not.  Western Australia had been its own independent colony since its foundation. It very nearly didn't join the commonwealth at all. Having Australia day on the day New South Wales was founded is a slap on the face of all Western Australians. <br>  <br>  Changing  the day  would send a powerful message to the world that we as a nation are doing more than just paying lip service to reconciliation with Aboriginal Australia (who call it  invasion day).<br>  <br>  There are at least two other days that would be more appropriate,  The day Captain cook first sighted Australia or the day the Constitution was signed by Queen Victoria, thus signing into effect our nationhood.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	NO|`|JEMtVVkBaa	as Grilled Cheese Sarah (what a name!) said, "Invasion Day" used by the Aboriginals is getting a weaker case every year.<br>  <br>  There have been many conflicts over land in many parts of the world, some have ended up in war, like in Israel.<br>  <br>  But this has happened over 200 years ago now, and we all have to learn that we have to come together as one nation and pull ahead. Yes, an Alternitive day is January 1 when Federation occured, but that is also New Years Day - so Australia Day would be the second agenda for us party goers.<br>  <br>  Other then January 1, what other day could we possibly use that is a major milestone in our countries history?<br>  <br>  Maybe in your speech, say what Australia means to YOU - even if its slightly over exagurated, if you give your class (and importantly your teacher) a patriotic speech, it may be good enough for a High Achievement.<br>  <br>  Research the history of the day (not Wikipedia) and ask people like friends and family what Australia Day means to them - and what they would think if it changed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|q34jUwQBaa	Its a significant day for us. So what a country was invaded, **** happens. I know you cant put that in your essay. But what i mean is that no other day makes sense. Australia day unifies and represents Australians, just like our flag, we have no ties to england anymore but we keep the union jack. Its part of our identity and who we are as Aussies.|`|hLNieq8xaa	Changing Australia day is wrong on so many levels.|`|UKGlHMmBaa	mittagon day|`|lzwv8Ujjaa	In someways yes, in someways no. those are the two things you could argue about in your essay and all, you basically have to argue against and for the day, those are just some things I am going to suggest to do, I don't know fully what against and what for in detail, but I think you should do more research on your own, if you want anymore help, just email me at meggie.emily.1990@gmail.com for further suggestions, I will be delighted to help you further.|`|52A2QsD4aa	no Australia day shouldn't be changed it's fine the way it is
8ftxES2Zaa	Statistically speaking, you're safer getting into a plane than into a car.  That's one way to think about it.<br>  <br>  We pass car accidents all the time and so they don't stick out to us.  Plus, we have had so many safe experiences in cars that you don't only think about danger when you get in the car.<br>  <br>  Plane crashes on the other hand are big news and media spectacles.  When they happen, they stick out to us.  And so it makes it seem dangerous to get into a plane.<br>  <br>  However, they are relatively rare.  You say it's not a phobia, so maybe if you try to think about the facts and statistics involved it will help you.  If you have an irrational fear this might not help much.  A stiff drink before you get on might help though ;-)|`|kaDAICivaa	More people are killed by donkey's annually than in plane crashes.  Seriously.<br>  **a good chuckle, and it helps me relax**<br>  I agree with everyone else on here that you're safer in a plane than you are on the road.<br>  I would bring a good book so you have something to distract your mind.<br>  If you can't get rid of the thought of a plane crash out of your mind, change your thinking and just keep visualizing yourself getting off the plane safely.  Imagine yourself getting your carry-on out of the overhead compartment; waiting in the long line in the aisle to get off the plane; imagine yourself walking down the corridor to get into the main building; then waiting to pick up your luggage at your destination.  Just think POSITIVE  thoughts and you will feel better.|`|xoxvHXAqaa	The chances your plane will crash are virtually zero.  That's why it's news when one actually does...anywhere in the world.<br>  <br>  From 2000 to 2007, airlines flew over 59 BILLION miles with only 16 accidents that resulted in a fatality -- and that's including 9/11.|`|9lbvig19aa	You have more of a chance of dying in a car crash on the way to the airport than you do of getting in a plane crash. Just relax, you'll be fine. Bring something to occupy your time and take your mind off flying.|`|r7tllHjuaa	I took a flight last weekend to Jamaica and I was terrified because I had not traveled in a long time and I have heard about many ... plane crashes. The only thing you can do is be calm and know the safety rules and follow them. If you see someone doing something they shouldn't notify a flight attendant. Plane crashes may seem to be frequent to us but they aren't. Just bring things on the plane that will make you more comfortable, relax, take a nap and before you know it you will be at your destination safe and sound.

pI5jKfmaaa	New Delhi<br>  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/in.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...</a><br>  <br>  Background: Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Arab incursions starting in the 8th century and Turkic in the 12th were followed by those of European traders, beginning in the late 15th century. By the 19th century, Britain had assumed political control of virtually all Indian lands. Indian armed forces in the British army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance to British colonialism led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU brought independence in 1947. The subcontinent was divided into the secular state of India and the smaller Muslim state of Pakistan. A third war between the two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons testing in 1998 caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. Despite impressive gains in economic investment and output, India faces pressing problems such as significant overpopulation, environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption.  <br>  Geography India <br>  Location: Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and Pakistan  <br>  Geographic coordinates: 20 00 N, 77 00 E  <br>  Map references: Asia  <br>  Area: total: 3,287,590 sq km <br>  land: 2,973,190 sq km <br>  water: 314,400 sq km  <br>  Area - comparative: slightly more than one-third the size of the US  <br>  Land boundaries: total: 14,103 km <br>  border countries: Bangladesh 4,053 km, Bhutan 605 km, Burma 1,463 km, China 3,380 km, Nepal 1,690 km, Pakistan 2,912 km  <br>  Coastline: 7,000 km  <br>  Maritime claims: territorial sea: 12 nm <br>  contiguous zone: 24 nm <br>  exclusive economic zone: 200 nm <br>  continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin  <br>  Climate: varies from tropical monsoon in south to temperate in north  <br>  Terrain: upland plain (Deccan Plateau) in south, flat to rolling plain along the Ganges, deserts in west, Himalayas in north  <br>  Elevation extremes: lowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m <br>  highest point: Kanchenjunga 8,598 m  <br>  Natural resources: coal (fourth-largest reserves in the world), iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, titanium ore, chromite, natural gas, diamonds, petroleum, limestone, arable land  <br>  Land use: arable land: 48.83% <br>  permanent crops: 2.8% <br>  other: 48.37% (2005)  <br>  Irrigated land: 558,080 sq km (2003)  <br>  Total renewable water resources: 1,907.8 cu km (1999)  <br>  Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural): total: 645.84 cu km/yr (8%/5%/86%) <br>  per capita: 585 cu m/yr (2000)  <br>  Natural hazards: droughts; flash floods, as well as widespread and destructive flooding from monsoonal rains; severe thunderstorms; earthquakes  <br>  Environment - current issues: deforestation; soil erosion; overgrazing; desertification; air pollution from industrial effluents and vehicle emissions; water pollution from raw sewage and runoff of agricultural pesticides; tap water is not potable throughout the country; huge and growing population is overstraining natural resources  <br>  Environment - international agreements: party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling <br>  signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements  <br>  Geography - note: dominates South Asian subcontinent; near important Indian Ocean trade routes; Kanchenjunga, third tallest mountain in the world, lies on the border with Nepal  <br>  People India <br>  Population: 1,147,995,904 (July 2008 est.)  <br>  Age structure: 0-14 years: 31.5% (male 189,238,487/female 172,168,306) <br>  15-64 years: 63.3% (male 374,157,581/female 352,868,003) <br>  65 years and over: 5.2% (male 28,285,796/female 31,277,725) (2008 est.)  <br>  Median age: total: 25.1 years <br>  male: 24.7 years <br>  female: 25.5 years (2008 est.)  <br>  Population growth rate: 1.578% (2008 est.)  <br>  Birth rate: 22.22 births/1,000 population (2008 est.)  <br>  Death rate: 6.4 deaths/1,000 population (2008 est.)  <br>  Net migration rate: -0.05 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2008 est.)  <br>  Sex ratio: at birth: 1.12 male(s)/female <br>  under 15 years: 1.1 male(s)/female <br>  15-64 years: 1.06 male(s)/female <br>  65 years and over: 0.9 male(s)/female <br>  total population: 1.06 male(s)/female (2008 est.)  <br>  Infant mortality rate: total: 32.31 deaths/1,000 live births <br>  male: 36.94 deaths/1,000 live births <br>  female: 27.12 deaths/1,000 li|`|elVDYy7eaa	About $1.47.|`|YAWkCPqYaa	THAT MAGICAL PLACE CALLED NEW DELHI|`|K3VhC7AMaa	Calcutta was the capital of India until 1911 under the British Raj until George V announced in 1911 that it was to move back to Delhi. <br>  When India gained independence from British rule in 1947, New Delhi was declared its capital|`|AA10352420	New Delhi|`|hzQDocWaaa	new dehli|`|y8qLvHwTaa	hi friend, The capital of India is New dehli... log on to <a href="http://www.chitranshtravels.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chitranshtravels.com</a>|`|ewXooNpiaa	New Delhi is the capital of India.|`|fspDJqFAaa	I is the capital.

I loved it and want to go back and see more!|`|0H63P4jAaa	yes|`|8rgfqHsDaa	Yes. My dad was in the Army, and my family and I were stationed in Vicenza, Italy (Go Cougars!) from 1984-1986. Vicenza is a beautiful city just 45 minutes or so North of Venice. I was just about to turn 13 when we moved there, so 3 years of my teenage life was a unique experience, and truly awesome! Other than Colorado, Italy was the best place we ever lived! The culture is wonderful, and a little humorous at times (just watching them talk to each other sometimes when we first moved there, we thought they were arguing, found out they just tend to talk loud and use their hands a lot. lol) . But the people are friendly, and they LOVE babies!! My parents used to get stopped all the time because some of the Italians wanted to see my baby sister. She was just a few months old when we moved there.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'll tell you some of  the best places to go there, and the towns:<br>  <br>  Vicenza- Teatro Olimpico (Olympic Theater)- It's an old theater where they show plays, and the stage is amazing. It's got kind of a 3D look, it's hard to explain, but well worth the trip.<br>  Also visit the Citadella. It's like a city within a city. There are many other places to visit in Vicenza.<br>  There's also the Campagnolo factory where the best racing bicycles in the world are made. Call ahead to see about a tour. It's very interesting to see how these fine bikes are made.<br>  There's also Monte Berico- a beautiful church, and Monticello is here as well. Trivia- Monticello was said to be the inspiration for the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. I've been to both places, and there is a big resemblance in the two.<br>  <br>  Camasano- A town not too far from Vicenza. They have a market on the weekends, and when I was there, the prices were very reasonable.<br>  If you like wine, there used to be a shop there that had beautiful bottles of wine of all shapes and sizes. <br>  <br>  Venezia (Venice)-  A trip to Italy isn't complete without visiting this beautiful city. There's St. Mark's Square, the St. Mark's Cathedral (I think that's the name of it), tons of great shops (some are pricier than others), and of course there's the gondola rides.<br>  But you have to take a ferry to get to Venice.<br>  <br>  Soave- My 6th grade teacher took us here on a field trip. He took us to Soave Castle. It's a medieval castle which was still in good shape when we went. I also had my parents take us there when my grandmother and aunt came to visit. The views out of the castle windows are beautiful as well. But, let me warn you (unless things have changed), there aren't any regular toilets there. The "toilets" are really just a hole in the floor with a button to push to flush it. It was funny when my grandmother tried to use it! lol<br>  <br>  Lago De Garda (Garda Lake)- The largest lake in Italy. It's located at the foot of the Alps, and not too far from most of the places I've listed so far. And there's lots to do there. Here's a link to their site: <a href="http://www.gardalake.it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardalake.it/</a> <br>  <br>  Verona- Home of the Montegue and Capulet castles. More popularly known as Romeo and Juliet's castles. My grandmother swore Romeo's castle was haunted! lol When we got to the castle gate, her <br>  camera started going haywire! lol It was one of those Kodak Disc camera's (and I don't mean compact disc- it used a flower-shaped film disc). <br>  <br>  Firenze (Florence)- The Piti Palace, Uffizi Gallery. Homes of some of the most famous paintings and statues. The Uffizi Gallery is the home of the statue of David, which is so tall and big, it has it's own room!<br>  Definitely the biggest naked man I've ever seen! lol<br>  <br>  Well, I think that should cover it for now. lol Enjoy!|`|U4yiOCGgaa	No I have not, not yet.

AA10740352	The legal drink age on all cruise ships is age 21 and it does not change when you are in international waters or docked in a foreign port. Its still age 21 and older. And all of the cruise lines DO enforce it. The only exception to this is if you cruise from a European or South American port and your parents are sailing with you and sign a waiver for you to have beer and wine. Otherwise always no.<br>  <br>  BUT, when you get to the Caribbean and get off the ship you can drink all you want in the clubs, bars and restaurants because the drinking age  is age 18 and older. Then you cannot bring alcohol back on board the ship either as it will be confiscated by the cruise line.<br>  <br>  The cruise ships, including Celebrity, control access to alcoholic beverages by use of your cruise card which you will get when you first board the ship.  It has all of your personal information embedded in a magnetic strip, including your name and age, and it is the charge card for buying anything on ship.|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	I think it depends on the cruise line. and i think in international waters its 18 but im not sure|`|BHHTQmSMaa	Its 21 on celebrity, because it is an american owned company.<br>  <br>  No matter where abouts you are sailing to or where you are from.<br>  <br>  And even if you lie about your age so your seapass card (the card all expenses are charged to) has 21 on it, it doesn't matter because most bar's (if they think you look under 21) Will ask for i.d anyway. <br>  <br>  Best bet is to take someone over 21 with you to buy drinks!|`|RRxlVNHQaa	yes you are.. i went on a cruise && im 16 && i cant wait till im 18 to go on one..|`|FivqlPUCaa	Oh, sorry!!!! I heard they JUST changed it to 21 but what do I know?|`|B23gd3wjaa	depends on what country the cruise line is governed by

I didn't notice that u were  there when they didn't give the visa to my mother, but my grandparents got it. <br>  <br>  you have no right to call me a liar.  my mom isn't able to visit her relatives in the west bank. this is a fact.|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	Yes, you can, you will love it, but you need to first get a tourist visa from the Israeli consulate in Jordan (Amman) phone number is 962.6.552.4680<br>  <br>  Enjoy your visit|`|AlbJmy7aaa	You will most likely be crossing via the Allenby Bridge (Hebrew: ??? ??????, Gesher Alenbi), also known as the King Hussein Bridge (Arabic: ??? ????? ?????, Jisr al-Malek Hussein)<br>  <br>  I do not know of any Visas being issued at that crossing (for either Israel or Jordan) as it is high volume and prone to delay.  So arrange with the consulate in Amman your visa ahead of time.<br>  <br>  Then you will want to secure a cab or minibus from Amman (only a few minutes as you seem to bypass the more mountainous crossing to the north).  Plan for long lines, as this is the primary checkpoint used for Palestinians and many other Arabs.<br>  <br>  I have seen many other people using the less busy Jordanian River or Shiek Hussein crossing to the north, and they do issue visas (at least going into Jordan).<br>  <br>  Either way the entry tax for Israel is typically about 60 shekels.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your time!|`|19ec41e42df6e58799e9d9a266240579aa	Hahaha, sometimes I wish that i can change my citizenship to visit Al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock, to visit the Haram-Ash-Sharif..|`|nHuMeLtyaa	Go to Aqaba and then to Eilat.

I have crossed the border between Jordan and Israel.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	It is very easy for the Jordanian people to visit Israel. There are many tour operators in Amman, who organize tour to Israel by bus. No need to take any visa, because you will not find their embassy in the whole arab world. <br>  Keep your passport with you. Upon arrival at the entry point, Israel Immigration Authorities will staple a piece of paper in your passport with arrival stamp on it. When you return back, the stapled paper will be removed from your passport, and no one will notice that you have visited Israel to avoid trouble with Jordanian Authorities.|`|vYXEPzihaa	what about palestine citizens who also have a jordanian passport? they can enter israel as well? im sure israel authorities have their names on their computers!|`|Ugb8MvFJaa	I've heard that u need an American Passport to even be considered in "Israel" so as an Arab I dont think the IDF will ever let u in :(|`|5FZy02pLaa	I would say you just need a tourist visa.

YPHaQ1asaa	It depends on what time your arriving in Bangkok.  But the safest way is by meter taxi.  I recommend this way for the first time travel to Thailand especially if your arriving in Bangkok late at nigh because the buses don't run all nightt.  It will cost you no more then $10 for a taxi.  This includes cost for airport fee of 50 baht and tolls of 75 baht. and the meter cost.<br>  <br>  The airport shuttle buses do not go past M Thai Tower you can near and walk from Lumpini Park bus AE 1 for 150 baht.  That is the closes I know of here is the website for the airport shuttle buses <a href="http://www.bangkokairportonline.com/node/55" rel="nofollow">http://www.bangkokairportonline.com/node...</a> maybe someone else knows a better stop.<br>  <br>  I still think the taxi is the way to go.  Plus keep in mind if your coming on Mon to Sat be prepared for lots of traffic.|`|7TtBBoZ2aa	It depends on what time your arriving in Bangkok.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Meter Taxi is the best way, anything else is so cumbersome.  Now, at the airport DO NOT get a taxi or limo from inside.  Go out through Door #3, and there is a public taxi stand just outside the door.  The price will be at least 1/2 of those hackers inside.<br>  <br>  Meter taxi in Bangkok is so cheap, and this is definitely the most simple way to do it.  If you won't be long, the driver will wait, or return as well, and may offer you a special rate on the way back to the airport.
BOA8nq4iaa	Honolulu is one of the more expensive cities in the US, right up there with NYC, San Fransisco, and Boston. What makes it hard to live there is finiding good work. Most of the employment oppoortunities are part-time with few if any benefits. The cost of living is high, too, because everything there typically gets shipped from the mainland, Japan, or China. It is doable, though, if you're committed to working hard and you get a little lucky.<br>  <br>  You said you got a work visa- are you coming from abroad? There are a lot of foreigners who visit Hawaii, and some do stay. But have you considered other places? If it's beaches you want and experience abroad, why not Bangkok or Syndey? I've had friends live in Thailand and Australia for a while (they were Americans) and they said they had a great time. And it wasn't as expensive as the states.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Well the houses are a little bit expensive. The universities their those are ususally half the price of most.|`|RX5aY2aaaa	Not if you're rich and you want to retire.. otherwise it's more expensive than a lot of the other states but not the most expensive state (from what I've heard).|`|shNvIqN0aa	VERY EXPENSIVE! What used to cost about average $800.00 for a 2bdrm., is going for high $1200-1400.00..even if you share rent, you would need at least 3-4 people to share with you, just to cover all expenses. Multi families live together, just so that they don't end up "homeless".  Sorry to say, but great weather and "free" sunshine costs! If the job your getting pays you at least $20.00 an hour, you may be able to do it own your own..I wish all the best.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	" you gotta ask, you cant afford"

There great shopping districts, world class restaurants, music, art and so much more. New York City is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic melting pot of people and cultures from around the globe. The City has something for everyone from all the major sports to live music seven nights a week, this is the city that never sleeps. The Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, the NY Yankees, MOMA, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Soho, the East Village, Fifth Ave, the list is seemingly unending.<br>   <br>  Location <br>  <br>  Our Language school in New York City is located in the heart of Manhattan with two fabulous campuses. In Chelsea, just half a block from Madison Square park we are located in the St. James Building. In Midtown, our school is right inside the world famous Empire State Building. Both campuses are convenient to all public transportation. Within walking distance of our school, students can visit such famous places as the New York Public Library, Bryant Park, the Theater District, Times Square, and lots of places to eat and shop.<br>  <br>  The St. James Building was built in 1886 has views stunning of Madison Square Park and, the Flatiorn District, and Midtown. When the St. James was built on the site of one of the 19th Century's most elegant hotels, it stood in the heart of New York's wealthiest neighborhood just across from Delmonico's. Designed by renowned architect Bruce Price, it is a striking combination of stone, brick, terra cotta, iron and copper in the Beaux Arts style with extensive detailing inside and out. One of its original treasures - a lobby mural painted by the famous French decorating firm of Arthur Brounet is maintained in its original glory. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Begun in 1929, the Empire State Building has been New York City's most popular attraction since its completion in 1934. The Big Apple's premier landmark towers 102 stories above Fifth Avenue at 34th Street. The building itself comprised of long, sleek, vertical lines gradually tiers to a dramatic pinnacle that belies its voluminous mass. Blending art deco with elements of modern design, the powerful yet optimistic schematics strike at an emotional chord that hark back to a visionary city as it was still being constructed at mid-century.

bGdTivxqaa	There are different marriage agencies out there.  Some have very bad reputation for scams, so make sure to check this in case you are looking into using one.  As anywhere, some girls are very serious, others are not.  But there is a chance to find soul mate through the agency.  I know of many couple who met through marriage agencies and have loving families.  So why not try it?|`|kAuQugVKaa	Hi Right! <br>  If you really want to use Marriage Agency to find your second-half, you need remember such things:<br>  <br>  *if girl doesn't know English and Agency proposes you to pay for translation of your letters or/and pay for her study, don't pay, because you'll pay for it very long time and she will not know English any way and also she will ask you to pay for interpreter when you'll come to meet with her! <br>  <br>  *if girl will ask you to help her and that you send her some money, don't do it, if you don't see in real life! <br>  <br>  I just read about such girls and boys, who ask to send some money and you have change never meet with her!<br>  <br>  But if you find some girl, who know English and who is ready to meet with you in real time any time, I think such girl can be your soul-mate!

LOL. I've heard the same said about many other countries though, so I agree with Driver T - trade out the country names and it's pretty standard drivel.<br>  <br>  My husband was one of those foreigners who came to live in New Zealand and did so for 8 years. He never encountered any of the negativity contained in this diatribe. He was never ripped off, nor was he turned in to a slave. We'd still be there if it weren't for the fact his parents became ill and we decided to move to the US to spend time with them and other elderly family members. <br>  <br>  The thing about the Japanese students - what's never mentioned is that the majority of crime against Asian students is committed by other Asians who take advantage of the different culture and the family pride. Reading further, I lost interest around the 'best health system' bit. No Kiwi in their right mind thinks that - just one look at the ridiculous waiting list system is all it takes to shake that notion. Oh, and what is 'wheater'? A new type of cereal?<br>  <br>  All that said ... what's wrong with a bit of national pride? Almost everybody has pride in their home country!|`|2Ta73Ejtaa	Well I'd say the person who wrote this has obviously encountered what he / she has written and is a very bitter person as a result and can now only see the bad, magnified 1000 times more.<br>   I recognize some truth in what he has said just as we both might look at a view and he would see only the areas that are barren and ugly and I would see them also, but notice that there are far more areas that are verdant and beautiful.

I don't agree with what has been said, but I can see how a foreigner might feel this way. Unfortunately some migrants have felt discriminated against after being bullied in the workplace. Those who bully foreigners have their own major issues to begin with, and if anything they only feel threatened that the foreigners are going to take their jobs. With the unemployment rate rising, people would be acting out in this way out of panic.|`|qU1G6FmHaa	I'd say the person who wrote the article has jaundice.<br>  Substitute words pertaining to NZ and it's inhabitants, for any other country and its inhabitants and you have a classic piece of universal tripe.|`|4ed0dd10cd34c2db7190f1097f67fc2faa	Wow that's a lot of pent up rage.<br>  Personally as a Kiwi I think that they way Kiwis treat you depends on the way you put yourself across. Of course if you arrive in NZ and expect everything to be handed to you on a silver platter we may react with hostility but otherwise we are more than welcoming. In my former place of work I worked with many foreigners who had come to NZ to make a "better life" for themselves and they were all treated as one of our own.<br>  As for the rest of the comments I have never seen anyone throw a sheep at anyone's head and what's wrong with having some pride in your country?|`|KuoFajx8aa	wow thats shocking.

You also may chose land/sea travel as long as you stay within Schengen countries.<br>  <br>  If you should however hold a type D visa valid for Suomi or Finland you may not use that visa for travelling to the Netherlands.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/WillkommeninD/EinreiseUndAufenthalt/Schengen.html#t7" rel="nofollow">http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/...</a>|`|94b8KImYaa	Yes of course you can.

5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	Yes, you can rent boards in Galveston.  Try Underground Surf Depot.  They used to have 2 locations on seawall, but since Ike, I think only the one just past 61st street is open: <a href="http://undergroundsurfdepot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://undergroundsurfdepot.com/.</a>  <br>  <br>  You can also try Ohana: <a href="http://undergroundsurfdepot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://undergroundsurfdepot.com/.</a>  I think you can rent boards from there, but I'm not 100% sure.  <br>  <br>  Also try Surf Specialties: <a href="http://www.surfspecialties.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.surfspecialties.com/.</a>  They used to rent boards before they moved locations.  <br>  <br>  If you want to travel an hour or so down the coast, you can try going to Surfside and see if Bingo's is still there.  I don't know his status since the storm, so I can't vouch for that one.  <br>  <br>  Depending on when you're here, you might have decent small swells, or you could have completely flat water.  So, you'll have to play it by ear once you get here.  But, you'll see plenty of surfers out and about if there's a swell to be ridden.  People like to surf here when there's a bunch of chop because the wind makes the waves bigger.  But frankly, I think it's more trouble than it's worth when you're fighting the chop the whole time.  Good luck and have fun!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oops, sorry, forgot to answer the other part of your question.  I haven't had to rent a board in a long time, but when I did it was maybe around $30 and you got to use them until 5pm-ish.  Sorry, not very helpful, huh?<br>  <br>  ANOTHER EDIT: Kris below couldn't be more incorrect.  Most businesses along Seawall were unaffected by Ike.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Of course, some of the most visible water sports lovers are the surfers - and the city of Galveston has designated certain areas of the beach for that purpose.

It's part of German history, but if you had lived in Berlin for seven years, like I did, that would be commonplace and of little interest to you. I actually never visited the checkpoint charlie museum; whenever I came along it was crowded with tourists, so I wouldn't go.
pI5jKfmaaa	Preserving India’s Ancient Culture and Tradition – Whose job is it anyway? <br>  Blog dated February 14, 2007<br>  <br>  By Abraham M. George <br>  <br>  Following a recent visit to Shanti Bhavan (a residential school in <br>  Tamil Nadu for children from poor families) by a group of graduate students from a prestigious American university, an accompanying professor of Indian origin (I prefer to keep his identity anonymous, but let us call him Subramaniam) wrote me an email expressing his unhappiness with the school’s curriculum. His main complaint was that Shanti Bhavan is promoting Western values and culture, and ignoring India’s rich traditions as expressed in its ancient art, classical music, teachings of its religious/spiritual leaders, and traditions. He suggested that we teach our students “tabla, or sitar or sarod…...  classical music ….. sing the songs set to music in Gitanjali by Tagore …. folk songs of harvest of love and <br>  joy … enjoy the music, the rhythm and the melody of dance that is in their neighborhood, than something that is sung or played thousands of miles away ….. let them know some aspects of the heritage of Indian language that is Sanskrit.”<br>  <br>  While Subramaniam makes some valid points, many of his recommendations are based on incorrect assumptions about what we do at Shanti Bhavan. He admits that he did not have a chance to interact with the students or the staff during the two or three hours he spent at the school, and his comments were based on seeing the posters of western musical instruments in the arts room, and a conversation he had with one of our senior staff about our secular orientation. But he concluded his email by letting me know that “I cannot (financially) support your school as currently structured. The de-Indianisation of the entire project is an affront to any one who sees themselves not in isolation of a particular region or religion, but that their very body and mental make up represents everything from the time of the Indus civilization to what is India today.”<br>  <br>  After struggling for over ten years to build a quality institution for children from some of the poorest families in India, founded on universally accepted values and secular principles, this lecture from someone who had visited us for a few scant hours and saw very little of our efforts was hard to take. However, I decided that I would reply politely, and clarify for his benefit what we actually do at Shanti Bhavan. <br>  <br>  I wrote him back, explaining that “our children learn three Indian languages, sing in both classical and modern styles in those languages, and dance classical, spiritual and modern (Bharatanatyam dance as well as folk dances of Kerala, Punjab and Nagaland, among many others). Further, they constantly do projects on a variety of Indian topics and history. Students are introduced to the great works of Tagore and Vivekananda, and the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. We celebrate every major Indian festival (no organized prayers, however), regardless of religion. As for the music room, many of the pictures/art-work on the wall might be of Western instruments as volunteers are usually from abroad and they bring posters. We do not have any music teacher of our own at this time (musicians living in the city are unwilling to travel to our remote village to teach music or dance for a few hours). However, our own academic teachers who know something of music train our children in Indian music and Indian dances (click on “Tour” on www.tgfworld.org). In fact, our children are better versed in Indian music and dance than Western. Further, our children have a great deal of knowledge about our many national heroes. There is no attempt to downplay Indian achievements, just as there is no attempt to downplay any other nationality.”<br>  <br>  I didn’t expect a response. I didn’t get one.<br>  <br>  This isn’t the first time I have received such advice from a so-called “intellectual” concerned about preserving India’s culture and traditions. Over these past years since starting Shanti Bhavan, we were told by politicians to change the medium of instruction to the language of the community (Tamil or Telugu), and others in the Bangalore elite class have expressed their concern about our children losing touch with their communities and families. We have tried to explain that proficiency in English gives our children maximum opportunity in the global marketplace. As for their connection to their communities and families, we try to make our children understand (and they do) that there is nothing to be ashamed of in having been born poor (an accident of birth) and that they should respect everyone, rich or poor. In a wonderful way, our children quickly learn to adjust, living in two different worlds simultaneously, and aspire for professional success that would one day carry their families and communities out of poverty and social deprivation.<br>  <br>  All this discourse brings up two important questions. First, with rapid economic prosperity in certain s|`|QqY8YgGDaa	I am ready to play any special role as you would suggest|`|mrSG62qKaa	Its important to teach children about indian sanskars and make them feel proud of being from india. <br>  <br>  India has contributed a lot to math and astronomy.

You will need to use the Hangul alphabet system.<br>  <br>  Hangul Keyboard System:<br>  <a href="http://www.cjkboard.com/kboard1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cjkboard.com/kboard1.html</a><br>  <br>  As the word you wanted to type is saranghae, you will need to match the hanguls to the keyboard, which is TK FKD GO, note that O gives you ?and shift+O gives you?, it is shown in the link above.<br>  <br>  I hope it helped!=D<br>  <br>  If you wanted to know the hangul word system (Not Keyboard):<br>  <a href="http://www.learn-korean.net/learn-korean-classes-viewarticle-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.learn-korean.net/learn-korean...</a>|`|njToL09Yaa	The Korean keyboard is not like the Japanese keyboard. When using the Japanese keyboard, you can type the letters by pronunciation. When using the Korean keyboard, you need to know the actual alphabet, like the English keyboard. Like in English, you can't type 'Computer' like 'Cuhm-pyoo-tur,' typed based on sound; you need to know what letter makes what sound. You get me? So if you don't know the Korean alphabet yet, learn that first and type away. I highly recommend that you get the Korean keyboard covers for quick learning. You'll memorize where the letters are 10x faster then by just testing out which letters are which keys, like I did. Good luck! :)|`|iekMDUqVaa	Set it up in Qwerty.? maybe?

fc07dd4e0ddbeae20f8e69ce27280ee3aa	Hi, I'm from Pisa.<br>  They can see the tower both from outside both from inside, then they can see all the square wich is called Piazza dei Miracoli (Square of Miracles). The square, besides the tower, is composed by the Baptistery, the Cathedral (Duomo) and the Cemetery (Camposanto). It is called Square of Miracles coz in such a small place there are 4 magnificient monuments. They are symbolical monuments, the Baptistery represents birth, the cathedral  life and the cemetery death. Some say that the tower represents the sexual act (that's why the phallic shape lol), but I think it's just a legend. Tourists can see the whole square for free but if they want to enter in the monuments they have to pay a ticket, except for the Cathedral wich is still the main church of Pisa. Hope I've been helpful, sorry for the bad english.|`|l4susyNMaa	<a href="http://torre.duomo.pisa.it/index_eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://torre.duomo.pisa.it/index_eng.htm...</a>

hqbt98QIaa	That means you have $5K to last for the remaining 43 days, right? You can probably do it if you're really frugal but you'll be doing it on a shoestring. It would be safer to plan on maybe twice that much though.<br>  <br>  A few tips: Youth hostels are your best bet for accommodations at $30-50USD / day as a three star hotel room is in the $120-180USD range. Buy food at grocery stores instead of dining out. Most museums and sites cost $10-20USD for entry but most cities offer tourist passes for 24,48, or 72 hour time frames that will get you into everything as well as unlimited rides on the local bus/tram system for the price of a few single sites. You can purchase Eurail passes for 5-15 days of travel at about 50 euro per day but you can also fly Easyjet around the EU pretty cheaply too. Taxis are very expensive... $20-30USD the moment your backside hits the seat. Also, make sure your health insurance is valid abroad. If not, buy a temporary holiday insurance that will cover you in the event of injury otherwise, you will have to pay cash and in the event of serious injury, it costs about $50K to medevac back to the U.S.<br>  <br>  It also depends on where you go and how you choose to vacation. I live in Europe and I travel often. I stay in comfortable but not high end accommodations usually and try to eat on the cheap. That having been said, on average, my total cost is around $250-300 USD per day while on holiday.<br>  <br>  Edited: 15:07 to add some content and clarify some things.|`|9e3125f1cbec258838efea7ac306d1c1aa	Yes, if you have a rail pass that covers the rest of the time, and plan on staying in youth hostels after the tour is over.|`|RCaVrLAoaa	well if your food and accomadation is sorted then i would say yes as that would be  over $400 a week and with no food to buy you will have a great time spending the cash (i would lol )

Savannah is a very beautiful city with a lot of history. There are a lot of different people there. If you come across a racist it would be no different than any other city. The South has a history with racism, but it no different from any other state that has the same problems now. That the misconception a lot of people who are not from GA make. So the "down south" mentality needs to change because as of late there has been a lot of racist incidents in the North and West area. This is it not going stop me from going where I want.
