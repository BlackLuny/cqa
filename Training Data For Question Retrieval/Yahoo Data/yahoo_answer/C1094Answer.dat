NYX Eyeshadow trio - $8.00   you can get them at Ulta stores, nyxcosmetics.com or Cherryculture.com  http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/Main_Pages/P...    For eyeliner, save money and just wet your eyebrow brush with water and use an eyeshadow color.    NYX blush - $7.00  I like the "pinky" color. It's super nice and easy to blend.  http://www.nyxcosmetics.com/Main_Pages/P...    Sonia Kashuk brush set - $19.99  There are 7 brushes in this set, you'll be set for a long time.

Good Luck!|`|Lz4wXr6paa	fifty to sixty.  maybe.|`|g5KuIO76aa	thats about 200+ dollars of makeup. if you want it for cheaper, go to a drugstore and look for cheap brands like covergirl, maybelline, and loreal.|`|O24FewSQaa	like thirty or fourty dollars (from target I am assuming!)  I will professionally edit your pictures:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|7Wu2RQVraa	Buying this from a drug store $55  buying this from MAC $150|`|4tdF05oSaa	If you get it at a drugstore, than it's probably about 80$ .|`|wH9EdF7naa	u cud get it at the drugstore for probably around less than 50 bucks. the most expensive things would be the brushes.
hWASYrgtaa	yes, target is actually where i got my flat iron and most of the time, i just curl my hair with it!    here go to this page and they have a list of straighteners to choose from.  make sure you get a straightener that is 1" or less so it can curl right!    http://www.target.com/b/183-0095381-5645...|`|Oi6Np9P3aa	You can get either CHI flat iron or GHD mk4.|`|PLujNxsjaa	i have a CHI straightener and it works REALLY well. it is kind of expensive but it's worth it. it also straightens hair very well|`|D1bvpTUyaa	The top 4 hair straighteners for straightening and curling are..    Sedu Revolution Nano Ceramic   GHD Pink Ceramic Curling Flat Iron  CHI Volumizing Hair Straightener  CHI 2 in 1 Ceramic Auto Digital Curling and Hair Straightener    All of these are the best hair straighteners which can not only be used for hair straightening, but also for curling hair.
MyUTJmd9aa	Try a size 32A if they have them available. (32's are hard to find)  Victoria's Secret may be a bit flamboyant, but the people there are nice, and they have a lot to chose from.  Also, you can try looking in your phone book under lingerie, and you can find a specialty store that can make one custom for you. (Like you can bring one that fits in the cup but not the band, and they can sew the band to fit you)  It might be embarrassing at first, but everyone wears a bra. So don't worry about it :)|`|djp7q9mMaa	i'm in 8th grade and i wear an A so probably that or training bra would be good and go to a place where you can get yourself fitted|`|azNO6v4Yaa	Go to lazena   try an A32 then if that is to small A34 and just keep trying more on until you get the perfect fit cause that is how i got mine bra|`|AA10348817	Go to Victoria Secret the people there can help you out.|`|dlY5xY5oaa	they make a AA. i think that's the smallest they come. if you're really skinny get a 32 AA. if that doesn't fit, you'll probably have to go with a training bra.   try looking at Kohls, Walmart, and Target. if you don't find anything, try Victorias Secret.|`|kgwcYjeqaa	The smallest size is a 32A And its very small.  You can buy cheap bras at "la senza" they always have good qualtiy bras you can even get gel cups inside of them, to make it seem like your chest is more full.    Here a bra from lasenze http://www.lasenza.com/eng/products/bras...|`|j4hmUPJgaa	Tube top bras are gr8 for small chests! I am 26 & a 36B. I have little boobs, but I also know how to work them where I have cleavage.    http://www.overstock.com/Clothing-Shoes/...|`|lHJTL2qEaa	go to aerie. (by american eagle) they have AA it is a good store for teens, so it might not be embarrassing. like i said, AA will probably fit you. they have a lot of fun patterns too.    http://www.ae.com/aerie/browse/aerieBraU...  there is a measuring guide if you click the "tag" at the tog right and scroll to the bottom|`|GASCQcqsaa	well I know how u feel!!!!....I'm 15 & only wear a 32a....some bras I can fit into a 30a.....was wearing 30aa last year!!!    I go to jockey.com or kohls.com..They fit the best!!    If you go to a jockey store they specialize in bras & panties & will help u fit into the best sizes!!!...    I also buy sometimes at jcpennys.
pid94ZxOaa	No! i hated my perm. It killed my hair and after 3 months or so ur hair will get sooo frizzy and wack. LOL|`|9hggEdf1aa	no it is not worth it...u will end up with really dry hair|`|QDl5owvNaa	probably not.|`|GBFhC35aaa	Perming isn't very good for your hair (of course), but once in a while might be alright.  I have curly hair, and I wanted straight, so I starightened it and I liked it.  But, it dried out the ends for a while.  Trust me, no matter WHAT hair type most people have, they usually don't like it.|`|gaFt3M3Daa	NO....jus keep your natural look|`|lezNfK8waa	That depends. Are you willing to risk getting your hair damaged? Perming your hair into waves/curls are really going to make your hair look like you've stuck it in a toaster. The thyglocalate in the perm sucks all the moisture out of your hair to break down the shape of your hair to convert it to waves. In addition to that, you have to deal with frizzy hair, bummy looking waves on bad hair days, and among other things, when your perm starts to fade away, your hair is going to look like a mess. It really is your choice, but if I were you, i'd just get some better styling products.|`|AA10348817	Perming your hair is worth it. It will last about 3 to 6 months if you dont get it cut all the time. I would do it. I have striaght hair and it helped  me out.|`|bR1wLXPraa	lmao. Maybe, its up to how you look like
9fnbMzXnaa	Tan with mascara on....keeps the rays from lightening the lashes, it works like a physical sun block. So do it at the pool and the beach, too.       If you have oily skin, lightly pat a bit of powder on your lashes before you get started. This helps it stay, making you less likely to rub the eye area throughout your day.       Never rub the eye area. Never. Not the lashes not the skin. Use the ring finger on your nondominant hand for all products involving the eye area. Use a decent amount of mascara remover and pat, pat pat. Its tempting to rub the stuff off, but you must refrain. It can break the lashes.       Buy a mascara remover that you love.  The smell, the bottle, the consistancy. If you can't find a fun bottle, put it in one of your own. Put fluffy cottonballs next to it. You will be more likely to take it off every night if you enjoy the experience. Go to the makeup counters and tell them you are out to find a new brand and they will give you samples.      Leaving your mascara on at night is your most likely culprit as to why those babies are falling out...so be sure and take that stuff off daily. Wash your face every night, and be sure to use a gentle soap, so as not to be too harsh on the lashes. I like Cetaphil, it's soft, removes a bit of the eye makeup, and rinses off quickly.  Remove eye makeup after the face washing (pat!!).        Apply a conditioning base before you apply your mascara. There are lots of them out there. This works in three ways, first it plumps up the lashes by condtioning the lashes... and second it makes the lashes appear bigger by adding some bulk.. But its good for them bulk. And thirdly, it helps the mascara to stick.        Get yourself a good water proof mascara for wet days and a good conditioning one for dry days.  If you are the type that never does know...or if your a crier...then go ahead and wear the waterproof daily. Be sure the applicator is of good quality.       And last but not least... don't neglect the nutritional aspect. Get enough protien (hair is made of it, after all). Eat your vegetables and take you vitamins. Taking Flax Seed oil may also help.      I hope this helps!!|`|150b0f93c501997cfa8526154331ff71aa	I don't think tanning with mascara on will affect them like that but you really should take it off at night and give them a break! I have extremely long and full eyelashes. I recommend using a little bit of Vaseline to take mascara off and leave a little on your eyelashes. Its super healthy for them, and much nicer than makeup remover or super hot water and rubbing.     I used to put Vaseline on them when I didn't even wear makeup and they are still long and thick!
972LCOk4aa	threading is not a natural way but its pretty easy..  you would need a thread. it hurts for the first few times but then it gets better. your hair grows back lighter and thinner and you dont get any hair for like 2-3 weeks. you could also try bleaching, sally hansen products are pretty good. waxing is the best one but since you said no waxing..|`|4q1LKBnNaa	TAPE! OR WAX IT! JEEZ! AND NEVER BLEACH IT!|`|4tdF05oSaa	You can bleach it ( like someone else said ) or you can put hair removal cream on it like Nair. Im not sure how well it works but it should do the job :P|`|fO2a2eeYaa	you can always bleach it.  if you are looking for a more natural alternative to bleach, use lemon juice, it could work =]|`|lezNfK8waa	No beauty without pain honey. There really is no solution that will magically make it disappear. You could try nair, but that's basically like shaving without the razor and cream. Trust me, if you really want to be rid of the hair, wax it. It may hurt and sting the first few times, but after a while, it will barely hurt.
8THz1sp9aa	If you THINK you want a tattoo, I say wait until you KNOW you want one. Also, I would get something that is meaningful to you in someway, rather than just thinking its 'cute'     deviantart.com type in 'flower tattoo' 'butterfly tattoo' if you find anything you like, print it out and show your artist, don't rip off other's art work (you wouldn't want anyone stealing your ideas, especially if they were dedicated to a loved one etc) and they will draw you up something similar. Most artists will refuse to copy anyone else's artwork in the first place.     As for locations smaller tattoo's look good on the inner wrist, upper back, back of neck, behind ear, earlobe, hip, side of neck, side of breast and on big toes.  Good luck|`|oM7bXmkvaa	Im 18 and have 6 and am working on 2 more..they should be done soon :)|`|SGy3e4pqaa	dude why draw on yourself???|`|iBjQR2iBaa	lower back tramp stamp|`|KCAeFaEkaa	top of your arm as so when ur working ect and u dont want it seen ur cloths should cover it unless u go to work with a tank top, and then u can always show it of when ur casual outside work ect|`|QQOAlcl7aa	i love clovers and am part irish so i got a clover on the back of my shoulder. i love it so a few months later i added to it. but ya back shoulder is easy to hide for your job.|`|9K8CRZyOaa	http://www.bmezine.com/  you can look at examples of tattoos that people have gotten and where they got them on this website and it may give you some good ideas.|`|pzXJRPGDaa	Hello I have over 20, and I can hide everysingle one, I think the best place is on the foot, or shoulder, possibly hip, or bottom of neck. Just get it where you want it. Best of luck.|`|c4dRJHYCaa	I got a tattoo at the age of 18. I am 32 now and I wish I would have never gotten one. Make sure you really want to get it and be stuck with it the rest of your life. You never know how your gonna change. I didnt think I would ever regret it, but now that I have kids and am a christian, it is hard to teach the kids not to defile your body like that. Just make sure you are really sure before you do it.|`|WeUEAIg9aa	Honestly, you're gonna wanna get a tattoo that means something. That doesn't mean take a tattoo you like and come up with some BS reason as to why its important, Really take some time and come up with something. Like, whats a hardship you've been through, or your nationality?? You could get a little flag, or even a little lock and key, to represent freedome of any kind. HOWEVER, i totally understand why you want a small, and cute one! Lol. Here's what i do when i am thinking about my next tattoo. I google what i like, then do tattoo's and then images. Like so.http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...  Or, http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=... those are the ones you suggested. lol. As for a hiding place, i work in a place where i know tattoos aren't okay and so far, the best place to have a hidden one where its a good cute idea, is the ankle, or right above. No tramp stams. You NEVER know when your shirts gonna rise up and show the world. Lol. Good Luck!|`|Gv606uKbaa	there are tons of places to hide tattoos like that,  but my favorite is behind one of you ears.  its cute to see a peep of it every time you swish your hair or something lol. I would choose an object that brings back a memorable time in your life. I chose to get a tattoo of a fingerprint on my side where the first guy i loved hugged me for the first time. I dont even like him or know him anymore, but its nice to have reminders of the things in your past that made you who you are now.|`|JduQHocdaa	Think about things that have a lot of meaning to you.|`|DR4LYQBtaa	not sure about designs but i have mine on my hip like lower so it hopefully doesn't stretch when i'm pregnant but i also thought about on my foot too..i actually plan to get one there too anyplace on your back you'd be able to cover up those are really the only three spots i can think of as far as concealing them.. that was my dilemma too when i got mine i decided on my hip and foot because i don't want to have a tattoo on my back when i get married.. and tramp stamps are overrated and considered trashy more times than not.. if you are artistic.. why don't you draw something up take it to your tattoo artist and talk to them and go from there... that would be better than having someone tell you something or finding something on the internet.. i like tattoos that mean something and are original
NCW1vXAMaa	i got my rook, tragus and anti-tragus all done at the same time on the same ear about 4 weeks ago.  the rook doesn't hurt anymore at all, however it was my most painful piercing, however mine is in really deep.  i'm not exactly sure how long the healing process takes, considering i got three done at the same time mine is probably longer, but the pain is completely gone and it's only been 4 weeks.  i'm sure it will be fine by the time your swimming season starts.
ZQ6JwJ25aa	Yes, give a 10 - 20% tip based on how well you were treated.  Belly button piercings take a long time to heal and sometimes develop complications.  If you leave a tip, you should be welcomed back any time just in case you just have a question or concern.  And, it never hurts to be nice.|`|15Zr5voMaa	here is a good tip, DONT GET IT PIERCED!!!!!!!!!!|`|7L7zpAT6aa	You can if you want but you don't have to.  and don't listen to all the people saying don't do it it's your body do what makes you happy.|`|055YEpycaa	here's a tip: don't pierce that thing|`|WzKrZoHQaa	I'll give you a tip - DON'T DO IT|`|11BLfuwraa	yeah you're supposed to tip them      i don't get why you're all saying don't get it pierced, it's by a professional so it should be fine.  but did you know if you get it pierced and it hits a nerve or they pierce it in the wrong spot, you could be paralyzed from the waist down.|`|2jMFurDoaa	uhhhh  ive seen it done but all piercers over charge. a certain amount goes to the boss for using his stuff and the rest goes to the piercer. if you pay over 40 or 50  and you will id say not to.    even if the piercer gets half of that thats 20-25 dollars for 15 minutes. they dont need a tip..    but again its totally up to you. ive never tipped. lol i dont think theres any kind of piercing tipping etiquette.|`|n9xVBW87aa	tip-dont get ir peirced!|`|9cdxjoMKaa	Hey...Well seriously i dont know why these guys are all telling you not to have it done...I've got my belly button pierced had it done when i was 15...im 18 soon and never regretted it...No you dont have to tip...and if ur having it done in the UK dont pay over 20-25 pound...Good Luck :) xx|`|zNz1OlPVaa	This is an elective procedure.   If you are happy with the service they provided you, of course you tip.  It doesn't matter what the piercing artist makes per hour...it matters only how you feel about their service.    If you felt there is some reason you need to express your displeasure with the experience then send the message by not tipping. Otherwise, after they have finished piercing you, even a minimal tip is the right thing to do.

9eb4f9ecc23dbc08ff09badb95268b49aa	It's best not to use heat on your hair, but I understand that you feel like it looks so much better when you do. I'd recommend making sure you use a product before straightening your hair to keep it from getting as easily damaged.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Sure you can. (in response to your question in caps)    I straighten my hair everyday. It's probably not too great for my hair, but I don't know what else I can do with it. It's so weird and ugly looking when I don't straighten it.    I've heard it can cause your hair to thin, split ends, etc. But I haven't seen any 'problems' yet, so I don't care what they say and I keep using it....|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Yes, it's totally fine to do it today and tomorrow because you've given your hair the chance to just rest.    As for how many times, you really shouldn't do it everyday. It's terrible for your hair. When you do go to straighten hair, use a thermal protector and a deep conditioner either the night before or right before you go to style it.|`|zgDxpqRsaa	every day is ok as long as u use a heat seal spray u can get it at salons for about 5-10 bucks|`|OSD5by7Oaa	well straighners damage your hair pretty easily so id do it 2wice-3times a week|`|QDl5owvNaa	It okay. Go ahead and straighten it. but it depend son if you have dry hair. If you have dry hair try to cut down on using heat on your hair. For example, instead of blow drying your hair just air dry it. also when you straighten your hair, don't forget to put some heat protectant in.|`|EeBpGOQPaa	I do mine about every day. or at least 5 times a week  Its damaging it i know but what else am i gonna do?  And yes you can straighten yours tomorrow, it should feel a little healthier too.  just remember to condition your hair and ends to keep it healthy|`|NmQ7HbFraa	its okay to straighten it. but make sure that you apply some kind of protector to your hair prior to apply heat. ( every single time)|`|k4pIGllXaa	I straighten my hair usually no more than two or three times a week- but that's just me. If you want to straighten it often (and since you don't need to get out crazy curls like mine) keep the setting on your iron relatively low. Also, the stronger and more affective conditioner you use, the better if you use heat to style your hair. Go ahead and straighten it as often as you want- but be careful and if you notice your hair getting even frizzier, lay off the iron for a while, it's thinning the strands. Hope this helps! :D|`|7lNWUIiPaa	More than 3 times I'd say is very bad for your hair. If you straighten it a lot, it's not good because of the amount of heat damage you have done to your hair. You should atleast you a heat protecting spray. You can tell your hair is damage if your naturally straight hair is turning wavy and the texture is rough.  I would say stop straightening your hair, but if you want to, go ahead, use some heat protecting spray|`|KUKDdAyFaa	I straighten my hair every single day. Who cares if it damages it. Hair grows back! So you can always get the bad part cut off. Three years ago I got my hair chemically straightened. I would definitely recommend it! It cost me $160 but varies depending on how much hair you have. And it lasted for over a year. Worth it!|`|Zv7sXMbTaa	straightening your hair does alot of damage. but if you do it once a week you'll be fine, it takes all the moisture out of the hair and then it eventually breaks so just remember all the damage you do to your hair try doing good for your hair to. Cholesterol treatments give hair back it's moisture so try doing it at least once a week to give something back to your hair. hot oil works good also. use moisture shampoos and conditioners.|`|MJz7ZRXraa	hey, im a hairstylist,..and the straight-look is always in lol.,but yes starightening your hair is damaging, but so is blowdrying it,.dying it,..and other things you do to it., but it doiesnt mean that you shouldnt blowdry it..cuz its normal. if you already have straight hair..then you shouldnt have to staighten it with the iron. but yah it does look a lil bit nicer and smooth. number one solution, is just using products to put in your hair be4 you blowdry it or especialy str8n it, these products help fight against the high heat of the iron and protect your hair, also helping it smoothen it, keeps fuzzys down or fly-a-ways, giving it a nice shine when you have your end result. as long as u use something like that your okay to straighten it. some products you can spray in after you dry your hair and about to str8n it. i suggest finding a product thats like a creme,,and after you wash it..apply it to your wet hair..and towel dry it in. dont put it too close to your scalp or too much of it cuz it can make your hair tooo greasy but its good for your mid-down to your ends of your hair, then blowdry it..and it helps smoothen it and actualy helps your hair go straighter, then wen you use your iron to straighten it..it protects it..and if you see steam comming from the iron out of your hair..dont freak..its not burning your hair. it just means that the product is working and the steam is from the product.,..so yes you can straighten it as much as you like..but keep up with your haircuts..a lil trim now and then helps get rid of those dead ends that split up your hairshaft,.. goodluck,|`|cJ1RpqY2aa	I straighten my hair daily and it is perfectly healthy.  It all depends on the straightener as well.  I don't know what kind you have but, the best is a CHI or one that has a temperature adjustment. I wouldn't recommend a Conair but, if its just occasional it should be fine. If you have thin hair I would go for a lower temperature straightener. It won't do as much damage.   If you start to see dead-ends or you hair starts to dry out you might want to try V05 treatments. You can just buy them at the drugstore and I find it really helps. It replenishes all you nutrients.     It will be perfectly fine to straighten your hair tomorrow.   Hope i helped!

OpRWTPvfaa	The longer you wait before taking them out, the better. Really.  Infection comes very easily, so I advise you to change them only if you're really desperate to change them. When you do change them out, keep washing them like you have been (or put some liquid handsoap on them while youre in the shower, either way works).    Make sure that the new earrings you put in are good quality metal.  Titanium, neobium, and surgical stainless steel are the best; surgical ss is the best because it's absolutely not going to cause an allergic reaction.

If you have then you can change them. But you have to turn them. Some people forget|`|29TiPrpuaa	I really think you should wait the extra two weeks,  It will definetly help, because infection can come very easily  to freshly pierced ears. I think that you shouldn't change them as long  as they hurt at all... Because that means the scar tissue hasn't formed completely and is not ready to be taken out.|`|BHDXE76oaa	no dont you might get an infection|`|CAI8BpRyaa	Wait for the six weeks, you dont want to accidently cause an infection or hurt your ears.

kG8j4uqaaa	This site has really useful information on how to get started as a model.     http://antmcycle12.blogspot.com/    And also a lot of tips on what will make you more successful and what to avoid. They mention a great agency to get you started off, and how the process works and pretty much they talk about everything that goes into becoming a model on that site. Don't give up! You can do it! All it takes is motivation and determination.|`|ycvgQdSpaa	everybody thinks they can model after that show, i tried and failed.|`|pJ9CDMNoaa	no.|`|ZuQzhhXmaa	first of all give up if you are not tall, bc you will ONLY end up doing catalogues or tv comercials, bc short girls cannot do runway or print modeling, bc clothes do not look as appealing on short girls. If you are at least 5'7 and you think you maybe have more growing to do bc you are only 14 I would say get some headshots done, and go to a school like barbazon, or casablancas if you feel really uncomfortable posing and walking. If not, go to a local city for casting calls. and put yourself up on modeling websites like model mayhem and such. It takes ALOT of work to model, and it's extremely competitive and generally not that fun at first, but if you think you have what it takes and you have the look, it can't hurt to try!! good luck!!!|`|UD3jAqQ9aa	ahh don't start thinking that after seeing a show on telly    modeling is nothing like that  i speak from experiencess hereeee      get a real job that wont die out by the time your 20  :)|`|TAlaBNC4aa	im twleve i started modeling when i was seven for a a lot of different agencys in san diego  so anyone is model material if u start at a young age you have a better chance im not kiddin u dont have to believe me but it doesnt matter if u do or not|`|AhcVDCaVaa	start taking professional photos of youself with a nice quality camera, and organize them in a portfolio.  then, look for agencies and send them your portfolio     an agency i can suggest you is http://www.jetsetmodels.com/    "Jet Set will be holding an open call every Thursday at 3pm for our new faces division.

Most models are insecure and unhappy and do lots of drugs. Guys will like someone who is intelligent.    I had a friend throughout high school who was really smart and then decided to be lazy and not go to college. Now she thinks she can model and seriously goes by what other people think of her and how they comment on her "modeling" pictures. She's turned into one of the most uninteresting people I have ever known and only cares about herself. She hasn't gotten very far and I don't think she will, either. So basically, unless you're Tyra Banks (who sucks), you most likely won't get anywhere. She's wasted almost two years of her life doing nothing. Anybody can get pictures taken of themselves and being a model is like one of the most pointless jobs in the world. Don't go down this route, be smart!

I always find myself in the worst situations wishing I had a tissue handy!  3) Breath mints. Nothing is worse than bad breath. Keep them just in case you are in school or out and eat something strong smelling.  4)Hair ties/clips.  5)A key ring, with your the key to your house in case of emergencies.  6) If you have gotten your period, a pad. Carry one just in case you may get it.  7)You may want to carry hand lotion. Your hands can become very dry especially in the winter season.  8) Hand sanitizer. Schools are filled with germs!  9)An extra pen or mechanical pencil  10) An address book with emergency contacts.

Well, when I was younger they did it to have curves and to make boys notice them. Since girls mature faster, they were already thinking about how sexy they can be while boys were still playing in dirt. I guess when you think, water bras, uplift and padding is a nicer way of stuffing. It's all a facade for men (or woman in some cases) to notice them.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	Because they're insecure. They'll come one day. Tell your friend that, and that she should love her body for the way it is instead of trying to change it for what she thinks is "cool" or what guys like or something.

s095tIYeaa	its a combination of things. your diet is a small portion of it. haha your right, junk food isnt the best thing for your skin.    and sometimes you can get pimples from lotions, but it really depends on what skin type you have and what moisterizer. generally moisterizer should make you break out though.     the main thing that causes pimples is if you touch your face a lot. the dirts and oils in your fingers/skin get deep into pores and cause blemishes. they usually take several weeks to appear.     to prevent pimples, make sure that you have a cleanser (twice daily), a moisterizer (after cleansing), exfoliator (to take dead skin off your face like once a week), and a pore cleaning facemask (every month)    the products im going to list are what i use. im 15, with somewhat oily skin. they might work for you!    Neutrogena---Deep Clean Cream Cleanser----$7    Clinique----Dramatic Difference Lotion----$24  OR  Origins----Night a Mins-------$36    Origins----Modern Friction----$36    Origins----Clear Improvement----$18    i know this skin care set is somewhat expensive, but these products should last for an entire year. honest. INVEST IN YOUR SKIN.    good luck|`|ugKQuggFaa	Some of those causes are just myths. Some times you just cant avoid it, its in some peoples genes but there are ways to help clear it like using acne wipes,taking a shower everyday, and using oil control body wash.It helped me out a lot!|`|081LAcShaa	Rubbing Fried Chicken ALL over your face. That'll do it.    -Don't wash your face too much It'll cause the oil glands to build up... OR your face will turn into what you said: ZIT CITY!!!!|`|mv0IKzEUaa	If you eat excessive junk food then do expect a lot of pimples on your face. If you have severe acne then lotions and creams are useless. Ask your Doctor or skin specialist to prescribe you medication preferably "Isotane". The side affects are very minimal. In fact I have never experienced any side effects whilst on "Isotane". But dont take the medication if you have problems with your liver.
faf627e55a95a22d42d6bbdbbb2c5170aa	Time for you to start shaving.    Yes, it's a moustache -- some girls develop a moustache, just like boys do.    If you do decide you have to do something, then there isn't a simple answer and there's a lot of misleading "information" around.    Facial (and also body) hair on women comes about in the same way as on men because of    1) your body being sensitized, before you were even born, to testosterone -- doesn't happen to all girls, but does to many    2) your body producing high levels of testosterone    The growth rate and coarseness of the hair depends on just how much testosterone is circulating in your bloodstream.    Steer clear of bleaching -- when someone sees you against the light you'll look as if you have a glowing moustache. Believe me, it shows up far, far worse.    As far as removing it is concerned it's worth remembering that    * Waxing, plucking, threading, epilating all pull the hair out by the roots and where the growth is hormonally-driven can actually stimulate a dormant follicle into producing more hair quicker. They also distort the root if done repeatedly, leading to hair growing at strange angles. And you've got to let the hair grow to quite a length before you can repeat the exercise. It can also damage the skin and discolor it. Long-term use of waxing also causes bad wrinkles.    * Chemical depilatories strong enough to remove the hair are very likely to burn the skin, cause swelling and cause long-term discoloration of the skin.    * Laser is also liable to cause burning and discoloration and in any case only works effectively on a dark hair/light skin combinantion.    * Electrolysis is very liable to cause scarring and discoloration of the skin.    Which, like it or not, leaves shaving which does not damage the skin and does not cause the hair to grow more or coarser or faster. Best done with a men's-style electric razor, the best of which, for girls and women, are probably those from the men's range of Philips/Norelco razors (Philishave outside the US). Most girls and women who try a men's Philips/Norelco wonder why nobody ever told them about it before.|`|WlTo0JJIaa	well if you wax it i will it won't grow back as fast as it you tweeze it so i definitely suggest waxing. be aware though it hurts the first few times|`|9cdxjoMKaa	Its not advised to wax/tweeze or shave ur tash...Girls are supposed to bleach them as when waxed etc they do grow back FAST definatly thicker and darker..Although if you need it doing ASAP i shouldnt think tweezing would do it any harm as long as you dont tweeze it too often cuz thats when the growth and getting darker kicks in...So you should do it once and have it bleached there on end if you feel the need to :) Hope it helped.. xx|`|v6mQzSSbaa	No they wouldn't grow back thicker, but will be gone longer, and shaving makes them grow back thicker.

Everyone's hair distribution is different.|`|29TiPrpuaa	It depends what shape of brow you're going for.    If you want to make more of an "arch", then pluck from the bottom.    If you want to make your brows more natural / straight-lineish, then go from the top, or just pluck very few strays from the top    If you have weird brows that can grow over by your temple like me, pluck em'.    I really think that you should always have under your brow plucked, it looks much better and opens your face up quite a bit.     Don't overpluck!|`|BHDXE76oaa	bottom and i like a lil from the top removed to but then you'd have to wax it to make it look good|`|sVdST6nVaa	bottom. Look it up on youtube... they give you really good tutorials|`|GZRTLEuiaa	the bottom and the midddle.    but the u need to get it done a plce first to get teh shape at the top so u dont look like a caveman lol|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	Pluck the middle (like over your nose), your eyebrows should usually start where your eye starts. Definitely pluck the bottom, and I usually pluck a tiny bit of hairs on the top (ones that seem to be noticeable), just like a line across the top (it's like five hairs). Hope this helps! :)|`|5h51YQPiaa	never ever pluck from the top just from the bottom   trust me   hope i helped!|`|Gh72E4cAaa	I'd like to know too.|`|0CjorHQuaa	the bottom,  you can pluck the middle too,     your not supposed to pluck the top at all.  you can go on youtube and see exactly where and how.|`|KPsWriOOaa	Whatever needs to be plucked...  there are no rules as to what to pluck and what not too pluck. If the top is too hairy, pluck it! And same goes for the other parts... ;) Just don't overpluck!|`|s095tIYeaa	any part that you dont like the shape of
5w4IvUEYaa	Here are a few links to help you decide what you need in terms of files. Personally, I use Entity Beauty files & buffers - for the most part anyway. Well, when I use files that is.  Mostly, I have been using an electric file for the past couple of years and love it. Shaping & finishing the nail is reduced by about 50% using an e-file. But really, that is a whole different topic in itself! E-files are quite expensive, and one should be properly trained on them or they can easily do more damage than good. Back to Entity Beauty now... Their Shiner is unbelieveable! It shines both natural & acrylic nails quick, easy, and fast. But, of course, you must progress from a lower grit file to a higher grit biffer - then finally to the shiner itself. But this is true for any brand of files & buffers. I usually use a 150 grit to take down acrylic, a 180 grit to refine it, and then move to a 100-180 grit buffer to remove deep scratches before finishing the nail with a UV gel topcoat - or sealer. If I was going to hand file the shine on, I would use the 220-280 grit buffer after the 100-180 Perfecter as the final step prior to using the shiner. Buffers from this company, and many others have two sides - and two diffferent grits. It's important to perform the filing and buffing in a 'progressive' manner. In other words, use a lower grit file first, then a higher grit file, then move up to a low grit buffer, turn it over and use the higher grit side on it, and so on.  For gel nails, buffers are not really necesary, but one can be used. Usually, I just use a 100/180 file for gel filing since the UV gel topcoat, sealer, or finishing gloss will fill in any scratches anyway. Plus, a UV topcoat, etc will not go on as smoothly when the nail has been buffed out too much. This creates a finish on the nail which is too smooth for the finish gel to adhere well to, and apply easily without imperfections.  Anyway, here are the links. Just click on the item you are interested in, and a page will come up with detailed information about the particular file or buffer. The Tropical Shine files are not bad at all and I know quite a few techs who use them. Its really a personal preference type of thing, and it comes down to using whatever ones work best for YOU.  http://www.entitybeauty.com/c-6-files-im...  http://www.tropicalshine.com/file.html  I hope this helps!   PS: Entity Beauty has excellent acrylic products, and their Studio brush is the absolute best brush I have ever used. It's quite pricey, but it lasts forever (well, almost forever, LOL). You must be a student, or a licensed beauty professional to buy from Entity. Tropical shine is available in Sally Beauty, and anyone can buy from there. I think Entity is a far higher quality product though. But then, that's only MY opinion, and nothing more.  Also, the rectangular zinc files/buffers at Entity last longer than the other ones shown. I bought some of them and yes, they were great files. But they wore down very fast. The absolute longest lasting file I ever used are Tammy Taylor's Purple Terminator files. My gosh, those things just do not wear down! They really last a long time. But, I don't think her other files are really anything special. And her acrylic products? Well, I won't go there...
NaPibFiYaa	I doubt it removes acne.....probably cleans ur face but not acne.......My stepsister told me her friend was next door in a hotel and she had a wave and my stepsister could hear it through the wall lol|`|AA11558047	it doesn't work very well. a lot of people say to me "hey! choose proactiv!" but guess what? it doesn't work!!!! try well, i forgot the name of this medicine thingy. it's called differin. it works on me so it'll work on you! :)    lily_cousins@yahoo.com|`|3ClIgMd5aa	it does work,  my friend used to have it bad around her nose and face, and she was trying alot of things, but then the wave cleared up alot, not all, but it made a big difference.  they're cheap so try it for yourself.|`|K7IS3NXNaa	i have talked to people who used it, and they said it really made them break out, but everyone has different skin types. my BEST advice would be talking to a dermatologists because there professionals at skin problems.  GOOOOOOD LUCK :D|`|zxyk7UWJaa	buy it.    it works really well.|`|qt7TvFsSaa	It is worth a try, the Neutrogena wave. I've had my experience with Neutrogena, and I can tell you that they sell their products through advertising. The Wave might end up being something in your bathroom that you don't use, because it doesnt work.     Neutrogena always make new 'miracle acne breakthrough blah blah' products, to make money obviously, it's just better to see your GP or a dermatologist (however the difference between your GP and a derma is that the dermatologist can prescribe Accutane.)    Even the wave gets the surface your face clean, it won't stop acne. Also their 8hr Turnaround microclear products are complete bull - NOTHING will heal real acne within 8hrs.    See your GP and ask about differin. Differin is really good, you apply (a VERY small amount) it before bedtime, *be patient* and it can stop new acne from forming. The adapalene (Vitamin A-like substance) encourages your skin to shed quicker, reducing the amount of blocked pores.     Also follow a routine, don't do a "let's nuke them" kinda thing. What I mean is, don't suddenly put heaps of pimple cream on your face one day, thinking it will help your acne clear up quicker. It won't work faster and you'll just end up having scaly RED shiny skin.      Good luck|`|qiWyo1T2aa	Don't buy it. I did, and it is a great cleanser, but it doesn't get deep enough to eliminate acne. What i recommend is Proactiv...in literally one day my skin was clearer!|`|TPJJ6KH8aa	Ya! My friend has one and it cleared all of her acne up! And trust me... she had horrible acne!!!

My teacher understands if we want to wear underwear and a pad, she just asks us that we wear shorts or something so she doesn't see our underwear.  So maybe your teacher would let you do that, so you wouldn't be as self-conscious.  Good luck!
AA10932670	Try some mousse on your hair & kind of scrunch it up all around the hairline.It should hide it.

If you screw it up in a bobble you'll always get this.  What i tend to do is get one of those clip things that looks like a couple of chop-sticks with a little spring on it and just tussle my hair up at the back so it's all messy but out of the way.  it looks cool and when you let it down again it's still curly and not stretched.  if it's a bit out of shape just wet your hands slightly and tip your head upside down and scrunch a bit just to reshape. Good luck x|`|tnwhFRsoaa	maybe u can put gel in your hair to fluff up the curl
ynM6Einnaa	i have my nose pierced and i switched mine within 2 weeks becuase i wanted my hole to be smaller... i use a tiny tiny ring you cant even tell i have it pierced but nothing happend to me.  if you can tolerate pain then just use your fingers or tweezers to take the back off and pop in your new ring just make sure the new one is clean soak it in alcohol for a few hours before popping it in but if your a sissy just leave it a lone and wait like 3 or 4 more weeks it shouldnt hurt as much then|`|JNKCxrQEaa	im sorry but you cant. it will hurt so extremely bad while taking out the corkscrew nose ring because the hole hasnt healed.    its physically possible, but the pain would be severe, even if youve been trying to move around the ring like youre supposed to.|`|Vh24i0T9aa	The best way to take out a nose screw is to look in the mirror and kind of angle it to twist it out. Also, you can buy a clear retainer (stud) and take it to the person that pierced it and have them switch it out and put it in. They'd do it for free. As long as you keep it clean  with some saline solution for the inside or maybe something else then you should be fine and you shouldn't get an infection. Honestly, 2 weeks is WAYY too soon to take it out. You should atleast wait 2-3 months and it's gonna hurt if you take it out now. It would not close up if you took it out and put a different one in, as long as you do it within 30 minutes. I had spider bites for two weeks and a clear retainer to put in it. The O ring that held it on popped off and I accidently swallowed the retainer when i was eating and couldn't put another one in for about 30-35 minutes. The hole closed on the inside and I had to push a new retainer back through it. WORST pain ever!|`|Cb5cEcpmaa	Yes, it is too soon. However, it is not necessarily because of risk of infection --as long as you are certain your new jewelry is sterile--it is because it will be difficult to insert the jewelry. The tissue is going to be very tender and raw. You are going to hit the unhealed tissue if you attempt this change and you could irritate the piercing and it could be hard to insert the new jewelry.  Nostrils will actually begin to close as soon as you remove the jewelry that is in place. If the change goes successfully, then A-Ok, however, if it does not...you could have a problem. You could loose the piercing if it goes wrong trying to change the jewelry.  If you do attempt the change use the same gauge you have in currently (or smaller) and not a larger gauge. Also use the same type of jewelry or the chances of damaging unhealed  tissue increases dramatically--that is, if you try to put a ring into a piercing that was pierced with a stud, and vice versa you will absolutely hit the raw tissue.  You will also want to use some lube if you try a change--vitamin e works well.  To remove a nose screw, you simply twist and lift it in the opposite direction from the way it was inserted, as they do, literally screw in and out!  I would advise you to leave your jewelry in until you are healed.  For aftercare if you are interested:  http://shorttext.com/heny0e|`|AA11820208	I actually gave up on my nose ring because it was too difficult to put back in and I had a job where I couldn't wear it.  I also have insanely long natural fingernails so that didn't help.    You are risking an infection as it is an open would but you can still risk it.  Wash your hand very well with anti-bacterial soap and put down a clean cloth or plastic cover in the area where you change out.  just in case you drop it, it won't be in the same sink you spit toothpase in that morning.    Keep it clean and you are fine.

I would no go to a salon that does not specialize in what you are looking for, or you will run the risk of having your hair over processed and damaged.

26d8240a81933de5ad6305f9f544e381aa	Look I think from what I read about you, you do seem (no offense) kind of "dorky", I do think you need to care more about your appearance, but most importantly your self-esteem. You have to believe in yourself and let everybody see who you really are from the inside-stand out, then by feeling really confident about yourself, take a look in fashion, try to find something you'll feel good in. I'm not saying to defy your parents, but try to talk to your parents (most likely a mother), that you are not in India or wherever your from anymore, your in the USA, it's a different culture, there are different ways to dress, etc. well and being smart is nothing to be ashamed of, Hope it helps!|`|AA10862126	Definitely a dork.|`|AA12062218	you are not a dork,  you are just made to follow your nationalities customs/rules for dress and conduct.  Just because you are smarter that alot of other people does not make you a dork.  It makes you special, and for everyone who thinks differently they are just jealous because they know they will never achieve what you can.  Most Indian girls/women like you are of that complexion and are some of the most beautiful in the world.  Do not let other plainjane girls or the "in crowd" kids make fun of you.  You have been given a gift and you choose to use it.  If other kids in this nation would actually use the brains that God has given them, they'd be just as smart.   I know this, because I have a son who is in the 6th grade, he is smart and is made fun of also.   I also was made fun of growing up because of my math/science/biology super smarts yet i came from a farming backround where everyone kept telling me I was a dumb country bumpkin.  I was voted least likely to succeed from my graduating class.  Yet I have achieve more than what they ever did.  I've got 4 degree's in medicine and pyschology.  I hope you put you brain to good use and achieve what you want.|`|828d0ecb2bd9c59f22cca05fe04b7ec0aa	be proud of your heritage, you sound beautiful|`|bc998ecd84fbc0adf3d9154f2683ff7daa	it sounds like you dont need any short skirts etc to get noticed, and no there is nothing wrong with being smart.

And so there you have it.|`|929d9308947de8147ba2519ca771d72faa	you're a dork to someone who judges people based on their appearance, but to a kind, honest person who judges people by thier character, you are a goddess. There will always be people in this world that don't like you. You just have to realize that they aren't really important.     I'm in sixth grade, but I am at the same math level as most 11th graders. Although, it's not as tough on me because there are five other sixth graders at the same level, not to mention about 15 seventh graders. Try not to advertise the fact that you're in a higher math class than most people you know; it would make you seem too sure of yourself, even though you obviously aren't.     If you love yourself for who you are, then everyone else will too, Golden Girl (that's a beautiful name). Good luck!

5800e5e08e091caff077732216952575aa	Pumping It Up - How To Get Long - Lasting Volume     The primary challenge in creating volume is creating a space, or air pocket, between the hair and the scalp. The most common areas where volume is desired are:     R - Root lift (increases height and length of head)  B - Bang lift (keeps hair up and off face)  S - Side volume (hair doesnt cling to scalp)  E - End volume (hair looks free flowing or shaped without stringiness)    The process most people use to create volume is wet setting to increase curvature or set a shape in your hair. The basic process is to wet the hair by either shampooing or applying a wet styler. Shampooing works best because the surfactants help the water penetrate the hair shaft really well.Once the hair is wet it is redried into shape either by air drying on rollers or heat drying with a blowdryer on a round brush.|`|7a5b38b938c5a397312ed997ce1074b0aa	put just a bit of volume boosting mousse onto your roots, and blow dry upside down. After its dry, spay your hair with a light hairspray, and get some large velcro rollers and put them just on the top layer of your hair.  You only need to leave them in forabout 15 minutes or so, but you can leave them for as long as you want without any problems.|`|04b7e5f40ef4718969f802c33e1c5970aa	weell...i use the mousse , the like press on it|`|575bf47e54c31a0c29768e347fd1ce6faa	Put  root booster in your hair.  There are a lot of products for this.  Remember that when you blow dry your hair make sure you do it upside and blow dry the roots first.  Ideally use a round brush.  Hope that helps :)

2a50084bdeb13a82f80d2a707d74e153aa	that is great-good for you. for your wardrobe the most important thing to do is start with great fitting clothes, try on everything and in every color even clothing that you may not like but that has great structure. since you're petite you want shirts and jackets that curve with your natural curve nothing boxy, your jeans and slacks should be a little long (i know not a problem right) and buy some nice little heels that are a bit pointy (just try some on there are some comfortable ones out there) both of these will help elongate your legs. you can start with basic pieces and as you  become comfortable and confident with your choices you can   be more daring with color and your new style. throw in a great  bag and belt (i personally think a belt helps hold things in) to pull your look together. as far as your makeup start with some neutral colors and add some pinks and peaches (great with green eyes) and a nice soft rose lip liner right on the outside of your natural lip line and a pretty pink lipstick or gloss to make your lips look fuller. look for a compact that has everything you need blush, eyeshadow, lipstick, etc. this way you will be sure to cordinate your makeup and it may be a a cheaper way to go (twice as nice). some nail polish too will give you a finished look even if your nails are short. as you begin to feel comfortable and confident with your new look and as your budget allows you can certainly experiment with different styles, colors, and looks.  you can still be your easygoing self without much effort after   you make a few purchases and get a routine going.  maybe a new hairstyle would be nice too.  don't be overwhelmed you can start slow and add as you can.  you will feel amazing. good luck.|`|d9969bc2a139500a4b9ac93551c42dc3aa	Try and wear light make-up so its not so shocking to you or people around you who know you.  I would start with a light nude lipgloss like Lola lipgloss indulgence in Dragonfruit or Sugar lipgloss in Pony.  For foundation try bare essentials powder make-up because you can put as little as you like. A nice pink light blush is Bare Essentials Goldengate. For eyes try neutral colors like brown eyeliner.  I wouldn't use black if just starting to use make-up.  Bare Essentials also has some nice shadows that are shimmery and pretty.  Good luck!|`|AA10729552	You should wear tops that are longer (like past your belt line) it'll help elongate your body and cover your weight.  Make up wise just do eyeliner and/or mascara in brown or black and some lip gloss if you want to keep things simple.  For green eyes try purple or natural hues(brown or peach/pink) if you want eye shadow.  If you put a little shadow in the outer crease of your eyelid I think it makes my eyes look better.  Check out ivillage.com for more ideas.|`|c25612f0966856d1a6923fa411c0d86eaa	hy there !!!..i think you must  change your color of hair in a re d with black, and you shoud dress like you feel good, and for ex, trendy...just on your size:) And you have to make up on the eyes with golden-brown on a day...and night with green or violet.....and i think your best colour to clothes is light brown, white, green pal ant a little bit of red !!! have a nice hollidays !!!|`|e4ae2e002d3efebf98942af8fc418b5baa	You are 4 ft 11 inches.  You need to lend some height to your apearance.  Given that you say you are a bit over weight I would emphasize adding some height.    High heeled shoes can help some.  However, not everyone can or wants to wear heals and that can only do do much.    Generally people who need to look longer and less squat wear long narrow garments.  Long jackets.    However you may (since you are so short) do better with any top garments like jackets and such that cut off at the natural belt line.     Stick with narrow garments.  Such as straight skirts or nearly straight.  Noting too poofy anywhere.  Poofy can look like child's clothing on a small person.  No straight leg pants for you or bell bottoms.  Go for a pant that is a bit tapered.    As for colors or make up.  I can not see you.  Go to a department store where sales people are selling cosmetic they will advise you and often will let you try makeup.  Take along a critical friend when you shop.  Someone that will be honest when you ask how a garment or outfit or makeup looks.     If you go into one of the more expensive upscale stores the clerks are often trained to help you find your best colors.    Even if you can not afford to buy from this person you can get good advice.  They do not necessairly have to know up front that you do not intend to buy from them today.      If you have something that you constantly get compliments when you wear then you know you have hit on something good.
46c4c1439dbfae9c16f84870382cbc66aa	1. Get a conditioner that is right for your hairtype.  2. After you have washed your hair 2 times with shampoo, first time to loosen all the "dirt", second time to get it all out...  3. Put conditioner in your ends, the hair ends are what needs conditioning. Leave the conditioner in for a couple of minutes, after that you can massage it into the rest of the hair and scalp and leave for another minute.  4. Rinse out with colder water to close the hair. You don`t have to rinse it completly out.    You could also go to a saloon and make an appointment for them to wash your hair. They will be able to recomend you the right products, and show you how to use them in your hair. It`s also a great way to spoil yourself, have them give you a massage...

If you have shorter hair, you should use a lot less. If you're looking for a spiky styled hair style, you may only want to use conditioner once a week as the oil in the conditioner can weigh down your hair with more use. It's always a good idea to use a light conditioner so that you don't end up with droopy hair.

AA11112224	At this point, it sounds like you have matting. There is no cure for matting besides, unfortunately, cutting it out. Get your hair wet, and take a conditioner and leave it on for another good hour or so. Get a rat tail comb and pick strands out of it, and try to comb through each tiny strand as much as possible. If you can try to get a friend to help you, this would be ideal because there are things that someone else will be able to see that you can't which may help. If that doesn't work, you will have to get this cut out. To avoid your hair looking completely a hot a  mess, you will need to go to the salon to get this cut. I'm sure for something like this most salons won't charge the price of a full haircut. If you absolutely cannot go--be very careful when cutting out yourself.    Who put your extensions in? If it was a salon, definitely go back there and let them know what happened. This matting is due in part by whoever put these in. They were placed wrong with most likely way too much bonding glue. If you did this yourself--get someone to help you next time girl!|`|T74PXGZGaa	try getting someone to cut small bits of hair out of it and it should just come apart without cutting all of it.|`|ozR2GMujaa	run a nice warm bath and just sit there and relax with ya hair in the water soaking,   spend as much time as you can in there and when u want to stop just spend a little time kind of "stroking/pulling" ( u know wot i mean)   yer erm....and running ur fingers through it in the warm water,     i know it realli hurts but try as much as you can to comb it wen it's wet,     if this doesn't work and u cnt do anything else ask ur hair dresser    hope this helps  xXx gd luck xXx   :)

yKJtVZvTaa	I'm not sure how to get rid of the redness, but don't pick on thim or rub them because that makes them more red. Just keep washing your back when you're in the shower and it should reduce the redness. It's just like a pimple of your face, if you try to pop it too soon, it leaves a mark and it'll be red longer. I know what you mean though, I sometimes get back acne too.|`|fTtn6fGRaa	I've read that a bit of visine actually helps reduce redness in pimples, it wouldn't make them go away but at least they wouldn't be as obvious.|`|2982549a17920484feef9062ba306321aa	put the following paste on the pimples:  1- open 2-3 capsules of antibiotic(ampicillin or cephalosporin) and put it in asall jar  2-dilute it with a small amount of any astringent you have in hand to make a creamy consistancy solution  3-put it on the pimples everyday and you will see a reduction in the redness of the pimples

39f1e02605bcff32190bb274c182020baa	This type of tool is more to replace using a round brush and blowdryer by doing it all in one step. You won't get a very tight curl from this dryer only a slight bend (unless your hair is pretty long, then you'll get loose waves). I can imagine it would take a while to get long hair dry that way though - since you'll need to wrap the hair around the brush several times to get the curl it will have several layers of hair to dry at once. I think this is a better option for people with medium length hair that want to smooth frizzy hair and give the hair a nice bend at their ends. If you're looking for an actual curl and can work with a traditional blowdryer pretty well, you're better off using a traditional iron or hotroller to get a curly look.

Andavo ogni mese a farmi controllare nel negozio dove mi avevano fatto il piercing e mi avevano dato un sapone antibatterico da usare due volte al giorno.  Inoltre bisogna stare attenti alle maglie usate e ai pantaloni, non devono essere troppo stretti e mettere troppo in tensione la parte attorno all'ombelico.  Bisogna avere un p di pazienza e bisogna considerare che  una ferita che sta parecchio tempo per cicatrizzarsi, quindi per alcuni mesi bisogna averne parecchia cura.

Ti5wZ7U3aa	Yes, I have used it. It is a good product for conditioning. You can use it once or twice a month. But don't over-condition your hair. That can also be damaging. Yes, it helped a lot. I was able to save the hair I already had. I would recommend it to anyone. Be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle though. It is hard on your hair. Rinse completely!|`|820a0b2e8975ef6e2b774166a0077fceaa	nope|`|8215318b49bf545f6119e9ccc7cd5b3daa	I've tried the treatment which gets hard like a mask .

df1f6954b6eb460b9cf7efcae4a33924aa	Sounds to me like you are having a major problem with frizz control, static control, and split ends.    But I may be jumping ahead of myself.  What products are you using?  May I recommend you try Pantene's line for Curls, they are the best shampoo and conditioner products on the market, and reasonably priced.    So lets say you wash your hair, you want to make sure you use shampoo and conditioner meant for curly hair, as curly hair needs extra moisture to lock in the curl.  Then you will want to put a leave-in conditioner in (after you regularly condition) that is meant for curl lock.  Comb it through, gently.  Gently is the key word, never rake through your hair, it will only create more problems for you later on, I call this Hair Karma.    After that, you will want to buy 1-2 more products, depending on your hairs needs.  Ideally, your leave in conditioner shouldnt be a 'spray" it should be more of a balm/gel, because then you wont have to buy another "curl locker".  But if not, then buy a seperate curl locker gel, apply enough to go through your entire hair...Even though the labels say a 'dime size', I always use 'quarter size' but i have thick hair, so I need more than the thin dime that others may use.    Now, youre almost set.....so you have all these ingrediants, go ahead and style as usual.  Have a "curl hairspray' in hand, and spray your hair when its almost dry, and then finish curling again (I call this re-curl), this will ensure the curl is locked in completely.    Now, what happens if this happens and still you have problems with knotting?    Well then you need to assess the damage to your hair.  Hair needs to be trimmed on a regular basis, but curly hair is no exception.  Make sure you get 1/2 inch trimmed every 6 weeks, dont skimp.  This will lop of the dead ends.      Also, have you looked into getting a slight layer put into your hair, not an all-over layer ala Jen Anniston of Friends (Not the 'Rachel'), but a slight 'crown layer' that eliminates heaviness that a blunt cut of curls will give to your head.  By giving a slight fringe to your back, it will really make a difference in how your hair 'sets' and 'lays' throughout the day.    Again, are you using an anti-frizz and/or anti-static spray/gel?  If the problem is related to dampness/moisture, as it may sound like if your hair is perfectly healthy, then you will want to invest in a good anti-frizz gel.    Another point to consider: your diet.   It sounds trite, but your hair really is a direct response to your diet and lifestyle.  Hair is dead, the hair root is alive. But the hair root is underneath the skin in the dermal layer.  The visible portion, the hair shaft, is just dead keratin cells.    So when you have an unhealthy lifestyle and/or diet, you will always see it in the hair shaft.  Yes hair is dead, but when it was living in your root, it was being subjected to your state of health, so thus when it grows, you can really see how improper your nutrition may be.    Drink plenty of water, but dont drink excessive amounts.  64 ounces a day, no more.    Make sure you are getting adequate amounts of proteins and leafy greens in your diet.    Also, try taking Biotin, it is a wonderful vitamin supplement for healthy hair.    I hope the tips I have offered are of some assistance.|`|AA11875031	Use  LIVON|`|uW7aWtFqaa	use leave in conditoner|`|spibF7Dyaa	Good question. You should try buying Redken Glass. All you need to do is put around a dime-size of this in your hair before the curling iron or blow dryer and it'll keep your hair smooth and absolutely know free. It's fantastic. I have had long hair for years and it keeps my hair so nice. Good luck!

893f39d5b982c19f1a5c63979e9cfaeaaa	Salut lillas, coutes il est vrai que ce genre de truc ne devrait pas tre une mode mais pour certains c'est pour se sentir mieux dans sa peau ! Pour d'autres, c'est une prparation de la peau avant d'aller au soleil (c'est mon cas !) ou encore de faire croire qu'on revient de vacances mais, l je suis pas non plus d'accord car il para?t qu'on ne peut pas en faire trop souvent ! 12 sances/an mis  part cela as-tu dj essay les UV ? Aussi, on remarque que les gens vont au banc solaire car ils manquent de luminosit ! Nous en Belgique comme il pleut souvent, il y a beaucoup de gens qui en font ! C'est bon pour leur moral !  Allez ne t'en fais pas trop non plus, reste comme tu es ! J'ai entendu dire il n'y a pas si longtemps que revient la mode d'tre naturel !  Bien  toi, amiti Isa|`|0FYmXVSwaa	dans mon ide moi c'tait dj bel et bien pass mais bon ........dur pour moi je vis  la montagne|`|20a8b02432023b7175848f70bc9e7e0eaa	Le pire c'est que cette mode est dangereuse. Certaines, qui veulent etre bronzes puisqu'on leur dit qu'il faut etre bronze pour etre belle, font des UV ou s'exposent bien trop au soleil... mode dangereuse pour la sant (cancers de la peau), sans parler des effets a long terme (vieillissement de la peau, taches, une tonne de rides et l'air totalement dsseche).    Perso je suis pale comme toi et je ne cherche pas a bronzer. On peut etre tres belle sans bronzer (c'tait d'ailleurs la mode, avant que Chanel n'impose le bronzage...).  Et puis a long terme, on fait des envieux, comme le constate ma mere qui comme moi ne bronze pas... tout le monde lui demande comment elle fait pour avoir une si jolie peau et si peu de rides. Il suffit d'eviter de se bousiller au soleil...    Et puis honnetement, je trouve que le bronzage, sur beaucoup de gens, c'est moche. En particulier sur les gens qui ne sont pas fait pour, comme les blonds ou les roux.|`|d2fd71124f6748eb7044dbcf5f02f102aa	ben ? cessera quand les individus comprendront qu'ils sont eux, avec leur poitrine trop menue, leur cellulite en trop, leur teint de porcelaine, et que ma foi sans tre parfait ils sont dj pas si mal que ? avec leurs 2 jambes, leurs 2 bras et qu'au fond ils sont aussi sympathiques que les photos des magazines (qui comme on le sait sont toutes retouches). tiens une petite dernire pour la route : la chirurgie esthtique  existe aussi pour le sexe, clitoris trop "pendant", trop grandes lvres, prpuce trop long, je vais perhaps demander un tatouage de mon pancras, comme il ne me sert plus  rien au moins il sera dcor. suis un brin amre mais je me sens triste pour toutes celles qui complexent  cause d'images virtuelles vhicule par les mdias|`|39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	C'est vrai que de voir des "bronzs" toute l'anne, ?a rend mon teint hal "caf au lait" naturel totalement Has been!|`|ac6f05c7de6a6a227f58378e420ee1c7aa	C'est inutile et dangereux de bronzer.  Maintenant,on peut bronzer n'importe ou dans Paris avec des boutiques de bronzages dangereuses.  C'est comme l'alcool,il ne faut pas en abuser.  Ce n'est parce qu'on bronze,qu'on est plus attirant,plus intelligent,plus considere.  Le soleil apporte des vitamines essentielles pour notre organisme et parfois des cancers si on s'expose de maniere exageree mais les centres de bronzages apportent des cancers de la peau plus rapidement que le soleil.  Les UV des machines ne sont pas issues d'un phenomene naturel et rien ne remplacera le soleil.  C'est comme tout,il ne faut pas abuser des choses.  Personnellement,je m'en fous du bronzage car ca ne m'apporte rien dans ma vie de tous les jours.  Avoir la peau qui pele,non merci.|`|e6d00ccf176d9cc2fee223db9a3d47d4aa	Allez, faison un peu de politique : le souci d'tre le plus bronz possible, toute l'anne, s'accompagne, dans certains mileiux,  d'une srieuse prvention contre ceux qui le sont de naissance...

It doesnt poof, hardly frizzes, and leaves my hair really shiny and I can actually let it go curly for a day without putting it up in a ponytail.|`|Q4ilGGglaa	i put a little lotion in mine and it works for me it makes it smell good and its not frizzy anymore.....but its just a little like almost none because to much makes it greasy|`|1848c606ec57cd6ca132ec3ec8b3bc42aa	try using a little BIOSILK|`|KQeAx469aa	I have curly hair also and when its humid out you should see it just go completely wild.

None of your suggestions is correct. Actually, I can not think of a similar sound in English. Did you see the movie Amelie? Her last name is Poulain, and 'ain' and 'in' are similar (in this case).

dQi94HYwaa	no, because they dont even know why benzoyl peroxide works for acne. its thought to be antibacterial is some way, but the chemical structure of benzoyl peroxide and its mechanism of action are not fully understand. it does dry out the skin, which indirectly can lead to aging. conversly, any retnoids creams meaning differin, retina, or tazorac have an antiaging affect and over time can reduce the appearance of wrinkles.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	Well, benzoyl peroxide works by oxidisation to kill bacteria, but this in turn may generate free radicals, which can damage skin cell DNA and lead to preamture ageing. Just use in moderation.    HTH.|`|7fb7e9b1c204fb5cad146656ddde06c4aa	Well do not use it if you do not have acne.  I have been using it for a long time and my skin is very young looking.  People think I am 10 years younger than I am.|`|Qos7hG8maa	I don't know, but all natural cures work better than benzolyl peroxide.  If you have acne, you can read how I got rid of mine on http://www.fredstown.com/acne.html|`|KQeAx469aa	Benzoyle peroxide itself doesn't lead to premature aging but by using it you are lowering your skins natural immunity to sun damage. That's why you will burn easier and age faster if you don't put some kind of sunscreen on after you use it. I recommend wearing a hat of some sort and using suncreen to keep the sun damage to a minimum while you're using the benzoyle peroxide. Also according to the wikipedia site I listed below it says that when used with a sun protection regime that the benzoyle peroxide will have a similar effect as a glycolic acid peels.

c058cd8101e9c9ead9b0fc9b72f8e99caa	Yes, it does remove the hair forever but you need to get 5-6 treatments.   If you use a home laser machine or you have a practitioner with bad equipment, your results will not be good.    I had LHR on my neck and my wife had it done on her UA and bikini area.   The hairs that I treated are completely gone 6 years later.   My wife also had great results.   My brother in law had his hands done once because he thought he looked like a werewolf.  After the single treatment he noted that the hair grew back.   We then compared the volume of hair to an old picture and sure enough there was only 50% of the hair...and then he was very happy.

AA11008542	I am a professional piercer and I do not know why you would get sick so soon after a piercing. If it had been a couple of days I would suggest unclean piercing or you did not wash you hands and correctly look after your piercing. Perhaps it is your nerves after thinking about getting the piercing done|`|AA12241120	Hmmm. Not something I've heard.    Out of curiosity, did the piercings heal normally and without huge problems?    Depending on where you went for the piercing, perhaps you got something from them (disease of some sort, not trying to scare you but it happens). I'm almost curious if its an allergic reaction of some type related to the equipment and jewelry used. Then there is the chance its a freak occurrence.    I have seen some people get ill shortly after a piercing due to the adrenaline rush and anxiety and more than likely a lack of food but this is a bit odd to me.    I would suggest speaking with your doctor about this issue. And if you decide to go through with this and get the piercing I would be very careful about who does the piercing.|`|F21Pb6jxaa	No, it is not. But it sounds like symptoms of anxiety. Talk to your doctor about it, or just expect it and plan for it.|`|tPN5NpSDaa	I would say talk to your doctor about the belly piercing, I have never encountered anything like that, either.  I have had people go down for quite a long period of time because of the adrenaline and such, but never flu-like symptoms.  If you got your ears pierced by a "gun" then that would be a different story, because blunt force trauma affects the body differently then a professional piercing done correctly in a sterile environment.

AA12241120	All piercings hurt, but everyone has a different tolerance to pain so no one can tell you how bad it will be. The piercing itself is done and over with very quickly so its not too bad. Over the next few day you may be overall sore and its normal.    The biggest thing is that you go to a reputable piercer and its VERY important to follow all aftercare advice given to you. If at any point you have problems or concerns you should visit your piercer ASAP to have them help you out.    And yes, I think nipple piercings look good and its safe if its done by a reputable piercer and if you take care of it.    Check out sites like bmezine.com and safepiercing.org for addition information and certified piercers in your area.    Good luck|`|JYfnRscfaa	It is safe if you go to a reputable piercer.

pAVw568Aaa	try a dress with a corset-like bodice. It doesn't necessarily have to tie up in the back but as long as it has some kind of boning in it, it will control your tummy (I have one too and believe me this is the best way to go) and you won't have to worry about it pooching out :) It could be strapless but I think a halter neckline would probably be the best especially if you are a larger cup size. As for color I would say black is always slimming but since it's a summer wedding I would try something in a muted soft color.. maybe lilac or light blue? It really depends on your skin tone, hair and eye color and what your preference is. Try on different colors of dresses to see what looks best on you.

Nous la mtamorphosons en une crature sophistique, hyper-articule, lgante, difficile, romantique et profondment incomprhensible.

It's popular because it resembles large crystal clear pieces but is pretty reasonable in price. Plus the designs are quite popular nowadays. Good luck.

I would just take it easy on your hair everyday, use a strengthening shampoo and conditioner such as Paul Mitchell's Super Strength line, deep condition it once a week, get regular trims (you don't have to take off a lot), be careful with hot tools such as smoothing irons and blow dryers, and take prenatal vitamins.

f650668c14b2d6c103dc37b0b2affbc4aa	Use styling products, shampoos, and conditioners for dyed hair.    Wash with lukewarm water to remove styling product build up and oils (washing with cold water is not effective when you shampoo).    When you condition, rinse with cool or cold water. Using cool water closes your hair follicles and seals in moisture and color. For added shine, rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar after you condition. This really works. I promise!    To keep your hair red without constantly dying it, use a henna hair color. Its all natural and also helps your hair stay shiny. Here is a link to a similar product. (I have medium brown hair, and I use a combo of red and brown henna every few weeks to keep the warmth and shine in my hair)    http://www.hennasupply.com/red-henna.htm...|`|28cf7dbd8da38b7d643918c13a952461aa	Try Aveda shampoo and conditioner. Get the one made for redheads. Careful, though, don't put it in too often. It can get your hair so red that it's almost pink. :)|`|7tRTZhnLaa	watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlWUTcQSq...|`|JgthDhbpaa	there isn't really . red fades. best thing u can buy is a red conditioner, it will actually stain your hair red, which will prolong the colour. the other thing is wash your hair as little as possible, as each wash will fade it.|`|HM8hXZssaa	Red seems to last longer on hair that has been bleached first also if I wash my hair with cold water (as cold as I can stand) I get less red dye washing out & it lasts a little longer.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Just adding to what's already been said:  When you wash your hair, use cool water.  When you rinse your hair, use cool water.  That's does help abit.  And, don't wash it everyday.|`|5Fo0a32Uaa	get a shampoo especially for dyed hair - it actually really helps|`|2TMbpYWnaa	If you are a blonde you are screwed, because it will always stay but just get oranger and oranger.  If you are brunette you have more luck.  This sounds gross but wash it less, and with less shampoo when you do.  Buying shampoo for redheads is good but the best when you are dying it is to buy some kind of if not very exspensive conditioner and shampoos for people who dye their hair.  Garnier is okay but color vive works great too.  Leave some light spray on conditioner in it too and just too much heat makes it wear off as well.  good luck!
026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	Yes of course, I can remember the days when most of the classy young girls used to wear hot pants in the summer.

Not everything has to skimpy and tight.|`|TxvIoWVGaa	Yes, like shorts that aren't super short and no super tight flimsy tank tops.    Try tucking in a baggish cowl neck shirt into short white shorts with a belt. Being classy is all about not showing alot of skin and being polished, with the right accesories.     Try strappy sandals or gladiators instead of flip flops, as flip flops are a little trashy.    Most things at Abercrombie are classy and simple (avoid tanks, shortie-shorts, and skin tight sweaters) and H&M has tons of great things. Brands like Lacoste (polos, capris, belts, and all that) and Ralph Lauren are very classy.    Dont show much skin and stick to the polished and clean look. No pre-ripped jeans, flip flops, super tight tank tops.  Try pretty pastel ruffle shirts, simple white shorts, strappy black gladiator sandals.    Things with graphic designs and crazy colors are not classy at ALL.    Simple, clean belts can really tie an outfit together. Pearls can also look very classy.    FOR INSPIRATION, look up 'BLAIR WALDORF HAMPTONS' in google images search. She is a great example for classy, clean, and pretty clothing.    Hope this helps!

86cf8078d236374316794f7c3867ec19aa	That is definitely disturbing. A man dressing in women's clothes is definitely not natural.

Are you against the Japanese or against men in bras? Are you mad because americans didnt think of it first? Do you think that the Japanese as a culture needs to stop inventing things? Are you mad because YOU didnt think of it?

If your designs are mainly just pictures and patterns on the items you can get it done in the UK, just find a cheap stockist of the items you want and then shop around for cheap printers.   Once you have your items, the best thing to do for selling to begin with would be an online store community such as BigCartel. Basically, you can have your own store within BigCartel and done need pay for all the costs of a website of your own. All you will need is a business paypal account which you would need for any on line business, this will set you back 20 a month. In relation to what to sell, well whatever you like! Theres no point in selling the high fashion items if deep down you have a punky style becasue u'l not understand what people want. Most of all be prepared to work hard and dont rush it, Hope this helps and good luck x
onKfEYL0aa	Grow your sideburns to the middle of your ears and grow a goatee. It would look a lot better than Mr. Jack White.

Its good to have a little variety with the stripes.|`|IAejVIFmaa	I think that it'll look better, less tacky if the prints don't match perfectly.  Love love,  Jules
XoADgEaVaa	Ouu, I love your current haircut. It looks like you have awesome hair. Thick and shiny! 8)    I don't think the cut you're interested in is actually very different from what you have now, but there are a lot more layers and some more structure. This might make your hair seem a little less full. Also, like someone else said, it won't look exactly like it does in the picture. She's used products, and heat manipulation, and lots of time-consuming stuff like that. Hairdressers usually have to charge extra to style your hair if you want to see it in the salon.    Regardless, the side-bangs and layers would be adorable. And, of course, if you don't like it, it'll always grow back. :)    I'd say gooo for it.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	it would look nice on you but you got to remember her hair dosent look like that just because of a cut she probably straightens and teases it & put hair spray in her bangs for it to look that way.     when you go to get your hair done bring the pic with you if ou can, its a very simple layered cut with dramatic bangs. it will look nice|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You would look cute with this style. Your hair it not that far from that now, it looks like. Just take the picture in and show your stylist. It really just needs a layered razor cut. You will probably have to use a flat iron to get that look. Your hair looks to have some body to it and the hair style is stick straight. Try some red or a color lighter than your hair as highlights. It would be pretty and really add to that style.  Good luck, honey!|`|rxHTi5ziaa	yes it would look great!!  Bring in the picture and give it to the hair dresser. Make shure you tell her that you wan't it exactly like that.  Good Luck|`|pS02JGTUaa	just bring the picture with you and give it to the hairdresser!

You should embrace your eyes (which are probably very pretty) with the right makeup (not heavy!) or something like that.  But, in my opinion, I think dark blue, sea blue, or a dark, chocolate brown are the best.  However, that is my opinion.  It really depends on the person.|`|QSyenf0Caa	You probably have heard this from others but I say blue. To me blue brings out the blond in your hair and blue eyes have this sparkle to me.

c26Ae2y1aa	Well, she did have the other dress her boss/friend gave her, so it's possible. I think she just used the lace from the dress her dad got her and the other from the dress her boss gave her.

PLPXzxC4aa	I personally like the 1st one better. It looks very well kept and clean cut. Buzzing it using  3 or  4 would be fine too. Don't worry about your hair thinning. My boyfriend has a receiding hairline and he shaves it all off. It looks good too. I know that for those who have thinning hair it looks best to grow it a little long and brush it forward but it looks like you have curlier hair so I would have to go with   1.|`|bQNgCsXRaa	The second ones  |`|Wscsgyd5aa	The first one. It's more flattering when your hair is thinning to keep it at about an inche and maybe try a ceasar cut.

LOL, I'm being facetious, but only because right/wrong/or otherwise, almost all of us have a style of something that we like, but just can't get our bodies into.  We can choose to ignore that (and God knows, I sometimes do) and wear what we want.  So if you can't go without a bra because you need the support, then you're getting some good options from the other answers.  If it's nipple coverage that is your issue, you can work around that as well.    Easy there girl.  I meant no offense and YOU threw out that not wearing a bra was not an option because of your "large boobs" so I only pointed out that if that wasn't an option, then it might be possible that you might not be able to wear something like this.|`|G6QbBMKaaa	OoOoOo you would prolly have to use a backless one.... : )|`|sFtPK9MDaa	You'd need one with a low back like the one in this picture http://www.awomansplacegifts.com/Bra_Acc...

I just personally would be too scared to try dying my hair again with a home dye kit to fix a color that I don't like.      Either that or you work your new look.

gSwobfujaa	i actually thinking scrunchy hair is trashy. with the crispy gel and hairspray. that doesnt look good at all. as long as its a natural curl then it looks okay. but unfortunately you have straight straight hair. you cant make straight hair curl. you can make curly hair curl. you can always get a perm if its that important to you.    random picture of a random girl i dont know:  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wE3YMeNZUbw/SB...    pretty scrunched hair:  http://www.beautyriot.com/stuff/images/a...|`|of049X1waa	seriously, 'scrunching' is only literally scrunching when your hair is already curled.  You need naturally curly hair or to curl your hair, THEN scrunch.|`|UmMxmmRMaa	My hair is the same way, it's pretty straight naturally so it just won't do that. I'm not bothered by it though; IMO scrunched hair is way too played-out...all the trashy girls wear their hair like that where I live, so I normally associate it with a lack of class. I do think it looks pretty, though, when there's only a liiiiiittle product in it as opposed to being completely saturated in gel/spray/whatever.    BUUUUT I'd feel like an a*s if I didn't at least try to help, sooo:  When your hair is wet, put whatever products you use in it, then twist sections of it to your head and clip them there until they dry. When they're dry or almost dry, take them out and mess with them a little bit, they should be pretty wavy. Then just spray them and that should work well for you.|`|qzY2tRTeaa	Have you tried crimping it|`|6Xbz5AOlaa	well try plaiting your hair and leave it in overnight-make sure your her is damp then leave it in overnight or blowdry whilst still in plaits and u will have a grgeous wave and spray hairspray on for the lasting effect if it doresnt work go to a salon for tips or look on the internet but dont be scared to embrace your natural hair why not try out a new hairdo?  hope this helps!|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	have u tried puttin ur hair in the curler and not turning it on and sprayin it with hairspray|`|oXK22WuCaa	have u tried sprunch spray....its made by aussi....|`|5KFhok67aa	I usually use mousse, then blow dry it on a low setting with a diffuser on the end (if you dont have one of those you can just blow dry on a low setting while scrunching your hair) it will give you soft curls :)|`|8HDlfG2Iaa	wet it then rub mouse throw it then scrunch it all up and tie it back and after a few hours if you have time it will look good x or you could always try a difuser on your hairdryer ;)x|`|9ibCaWJmaa	try takin a shower and brush it out as soon as u get out then leave it up twisted into a bun untill u ready for u to scrunch it..i do that at night for school in tha morning and i use got2be spray gel and it works rele good

Donc tu pars d'un c?t et tu les lisses en les plaquant le plus possible tout en faisant le tour de la tte.  Il vaut parfois mieux enrouler (sur un rouleau) la mche du dessus de la tte.  Parfois il faut mettre plusieurs pinces plates pour que ?a tienne.

rOj4B5QNaa	I was dating a guy when I decided to get my first tat.  He disapproved when he thought I was getting something little (turned into a side piece that took 12-13 hours).  Told me what Richard told you, to get a necklace or something instead.  It is a memorial tattoo for my mom and a best friend, both of which I had lost in the past year.  I told him to go screw himself, it's my body and I'll do whatever I want with it.  If I want to decorate it, then I'll decorate it!  Point is, if your partner is going to be that superficial then you can do better!  Oh and by the way, nipple piercings are not gay!  I happen to think they are super hot if you have the body to pull it off.  Good luck!|`|CMphFcppaa	if its realllly what you want, go for it. just know that it might completely turn her off if you get them. but if you want to take that chance go ahead.|`|pDUW6RZzaa	DUDE GET IT DONE |`|qjMP3EiGaa	As a woman, I can tell you most of us think the pierced nipples look is really nasty.  Makes your chest look like a pair of door knockers, and it just looks altogether immature.|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	I'm 51. Get a nice gold chain or diamond ring with your money. Just   think how gay your idea is... My brother  died of AIDS !!!!!!  I know what  both   sides of the street are all about.    A real woman with her right nipple    pierced is a sign of class. Most men   will never handle her. A guy or a real   man should never think about this. |`|puEjSoDfaa	If its what you want to do, then go for it:)  I didnt like my boyfriends tongue piercing at first but now i'm used to it, it doesn't bother me at all anymore.  |`|zscuDpaIaa	uhhhh no way! gross|`|eFaYMmuraa	Yeah, but only get one done, both look funny!|`|6L9jJnchaa	Sure, why not? =)|`|3GmMQ4mgaa	Call me old fashioned but just because you are in a relationship does not mean your partner makes your personal decisions for you. Tell your GF to get lost and get them pierced. Actually pierce them first then tell her to get lost.|`|LSLPPG6gaa	Don't do it dude... piercings are VERY 1990's - meaning that they won't be "cool" again for another 3 years! Hahahaha (sadly my job is in trend forecasting)! Seriously - especially the nipple piercings - kinda "sissy" (no offense). Invest in a traditional MOM tattoo instead - what woman doesn't like a mama's boy? And they look cool when faded and also... never go out of style!|`|IHShp1ehaa	Just do it,   its your own decision.    besides you cant let her contoll what you do.  so i say do it, and tell her tthat its your body.|`|pNDGcr5Iaa	I'm heavily tattooed, and my girl digs it, but don't have any piercings.

AA10343094	the first one. you could do either, because your face is oval (which is the look a good haircut should acheive), but the second one looks like you might not want to do the upkeep on it. it's alot of styling, and your hair's not long enough!|`|AA11901859	i like the pete wentz one, but im not sure if you hair is quite long enough for it...|`|eX8i4vwRaa	deffinitely the first one ;]|`|j3g5UapGaa	your really hot :)  and i would say to get the second one it wil look so good on you just wait another month and your hair should be long enough  good luck |`|4FqP313qaa	oh my gosh  1!!!|`|cXPVtTUJaa	Hey, you're really good looking.  :)  I think you should go with the first one and then grow it out for the second one.|`|puEjSoDfaa	First one:)) and you are cute|`|4hxWp1WOaa	I think you would suit the second one as I think you suit your forehead being covered a bit more|`|GW6sPwUNaa	first one is better|`|aRIlPn0yaa	2...but idk if your hair is long enough yet|`|mhXboni1aa	do not do the first one he's a douchebag    I actually like your own haircut the best, just get it shaped a bit and get some good product  |`|qQSqkwN0aa	You kinda look like the guy thats playing jacob in Twilight but anyways.....

He is a hottie and maybe with his hair you'll be a hottie too!!!!!  Just make sure you pull off the styling and all that jazz!    |`|ZKiLiG4Uaa	if you grow out your bangs then you would look super hot in the second one. i also think you would look good with the first one and get the acne or bumps or whatever off your face. (no offense) the second one needs a lot of styling and gel and a very professional hair cut. i think the first one is easier to manage. i hope i helped! :)|`|XqmvR7qtaa	the 2nd one.|`|ucSzhUrQaa	hahahhahahahahhhahahahahahahahhaha    the first is better lol|`|ruVmWlPqaa	Second one, because you can always gel it up it you don't like it and then it would be like the first one. Hot btw ;)|`|vhK7lfkdaa	i'd go witht he first but the second one would look good to but to me it's a very asian look since many asians in order to look even more exotic and edgy do hair styles similar to that.    i'm asian too so i've seen the second one alot. it's still a nice cut though, but i prefer the first.|`|3CQb6PSFaa	first one! :)  ps, i think i know you, lolz|`|KGQYogeraa	i think i like your hair the way it is now, but if i had to choose i'd say 1 cuz for 2 your hair isnt long enough haha|`|BRLkBWsDaa	2 things    1.

WHodJ7u5aa	It depends on the type of hair you have but from all of my hair doing days no ones hair ever fell out.|`|QFXYzQuMaa	chances are no, especially if you already have healthy hair. however the bleach and other chemicals that come in blonde or lighter shaded hair dyes will dry out your hair and will potentially cause PERMANENT danger. if you get your hair highlighed in a salon you should have no worries about your hair falling out.  your hair most likely wont fall out, but since going lighter is risky (especially if you already have dark hair) your best bet is making an investment in spending money to get it done professionally, because unless ur a professional, blonde or highlights done at home look obvious that you did them yourself and un-natural.  Good luck!|`|ET7iUE5Eaa	it depends on what type of hair you have, it doesnt fall out anyway!! I have got really thin hair and i got blonde highlights in my hair, it does damage your hair and it does fall out a bit but not to the extreme that you will loose your hair|`|ZoxljruRaa	no! lol. It will be unhealthy though. |`|KxvJYXkDaa	nooo|`|hZkLVF2Baa	No, if you do it correctly. Get it done at a salon.|`|AA11627844	it can if your hair is in bad shape. excess dye can wreak havoc on hair that is dry or damaged. so you have to make that call on the condition of your hair.|`|tfdt1WPgaa	only if ur lucky|`|MGDtjCK1aa	no but it will make you a lil dumber than you were b4 the highlights. lol i dont kno|`|pJxWdHP9aa	it did for my friend... but it didn't all just fall out :P      but sometimes there'd be a bit of loose hair on her, or on her jacket... not bad though|`|NDMesTasaa	Hair dye has strong acids.  It takes a professional to handle it safely.  And even then, women sometimes end up with a bald spot right on top of their heads from the acid.    BE careful.|`|bsECvSAtaa	thats what i have and no but it kinda damages it make sure to use a good cond. and dont do it yourself! seek professional help!  muah*|`|RWR0XE7qaa	No, but be sure to keep your hair well hydrated. I would do a conditioning treatment every other week or at least once a month|`|sAOfyGU9aa	Depends on your hair type and colour as to how damaged it will be.. But it won't fall out. Especially with highlights instead of a full head. Just make sure it's done professionally.|`|RwY1xMwsaa	Well not a whole lot but maybe just a little.|`|u7o75zipaa	Naah!  Just don't dye it too often, and use conditioning treatments to maintain healthy hair.  If you're going to a professional they'll advise you on what treatments would be most suitable for you.  You may have a little breakage, but nothing major!|`|jK5FXm6Naa	I used to do that all the time, I was always told that it wouldn't do your hair any good because it makes it really dry(not that the hairdresser told me, they wanted the money) :P|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	DEFINITELY go to a PROFESSIONAL for that!  Will come out a lot nicer, too.  No offense!!!!!!|`|puEjSoDfaa	No, but it will if you don't wait long enough between colorings and if you put a lot of heat on your hair for a long period of time.  |`|4LvtYgvRaa	lots of highlights mainly tend to make the hair fallout.|`|9c664e07f8c2007897e3697258c8ca68aa	no but make sure you get it done at a salon|`|aou7wmJnaa	you might have a little bit of breakage, but if your stylist does it right, you should have no problems!|`|AA11161235	Only if  you have realy fragile hair |`|Q4lzLhIvaa	nope it wont thats a crazy idea    it puts colour in your hair and after a while it will fade away|`|gl7lqLqSaa	No it wont, unless you plan on dying it over and over and over for a long period of time. Besides it shouldnt make it fall out even then, just damaged (:|`|EPV8CMbbaa	I have many blond highlights too and my hair did not fall out, so I don't think that this will happen to you only if the hairdresser uses a wrong type of color.

The first one looks more common whilst the second one is more unique :)  Wear with nice black heels & clutch.|`|X69Egz9aaa	the black 1 :) nd with silver shoes :)|`|I5Hm8CYVaa	The pink one is better.

aJxAb1OCaa	ahh me and you are the same.      1.) Every other day is good.. I do it every 2 days... natural grease is the best hair product ever.  2.) After washing your hair, get some Queen Helene hair gel, this will not flake... put a gob of it through your hair, brush it, towel dry, and reapply.  Mousse the fringe and part.  Blow dry the part dry so it stays in one place.  3.)  No... as long as you use heat friendly hair products.  4.)  MUST use Gel with a mixture of Frizz-Ez (Queen Helene again is very good with wispy hairs and fly-aways)  Also, get a hair brush that has soft bristles, instead of the vinyl back brushes, as this causes that static    Also, you can get a permanent hair-straightening at a salon, which lasts about 6 months.  hope this helps!|`|O71xlcG3aa	I wash my hair every other day and on the off days I just rinse it with water and spray the ends with leave in conditioner.  A hair serum will really hel the static like John Freida or just take a dryer sheet and lightly rub it through your hair.  Straightening everyday will make your hair weak but the hair serum will protect it.  Sorry I didn't really understand  2!|`|FOsd9DP6aa	You shouldn't wash your hair everyday, it strips the natural oils out of   it... I think every other day is fine tbh :)  If it gets static try a smoothing shampoo and conditioner and if you straighten your hair everyday you really have to use an intensive conditioning treatment once a week minimum.  You can also get smoothing balms to flatten fly away hairs.  And you sounds like you have a cowslick. Theres nothing you can do immediately but I think a side fringe would be easier to control. You can just train it across when blow drying and clipping it across when you're at home.|`|mOJhj3ssaa	i also have extremely thick hair, but mine is also culry, & i wash mine every other day b/c my hair gets totally out of control if wash it more. & yes straighting your hair with heated things is very bad, it can cause breakage. i have to use a variety of hair care products everyday just to keep mine managable.|`|0UYJkSuZaa	Your hair sounds like mine when I have it long. I used to get the bottom 4-6 inches where the kinks start thinned out a little with thinning shears at the salon and it made it less awkward and bushy.    1. Specialists suggest only washing your hair once a week. But for most this is not possible due to the natural oils in your hair. If you use a very mild shampoo and conditioner (like baby or kids) you can wash everyday or every other day. You can wash it every couple of days and then if you notice your hair starting to look oily and dirty, take a large powder/blush brush and some baby powder and lightly dust the oily areas.    2. To get rid of that part in your bangs, wet them before you go to bed at night. Then comb them straight down how you want them and take a bobby pin or two and pin them straight down so that the part is filled. Sleep like that for a week or so and it will "train" your hair.    3. Straightening your hair everyday damages your hair. The heat can dry out your hair and weaken it causing it to be easily broken.    4. For the static, you can spray a little bit of hair spray on your brush before you brush it. Or you can buy a light smoothing mist to spray on your hair when you get out of the shower. This helps reduce fly aways caused by static and it will also help smooth out some of the kinks towards the bottom.    I hope I helped some.

JbSebJJYaa	I would most def go to a Paul Mitchell school. I graduated from one in Arkansas and I LOVEEEEEEEEEEED it. They instructors are amazing and the tools and knowledge you will get are amazing.    You don't have to go to college to open up your salon unless you just want to. Paul mitchell taught me a lot about salon management and fundamentals.     I would start off as a hairstylist for a couple of years and get some experience and get in the salon first before you decide to open your own up. I've had friends open their own salon up right after school and end up shutting it down because they can't handle it. You will make more money if you work in a salon first !      - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional

MYhQqeV7aa	If your ring is set in 14K or 18K gold, then take it to a jeweler, and ask him what it would cost. There is a labor cost in removing the stone, and more labor in setting the new stone.

hLdIO43Xaa	Freshwater Pearls versus Saltwater Pearls   When you think of freshwater pearls, small size and lopsided shapes may come to mind. That was pretty much the case ten years ago. For many years, freshwater pearl farms only produced low quality rice pearls, while saltwater pearls, were more round and of better quality. The past ten years has seen many improvements in the cultivation and processing techniques of freshwater pearls.       The least expensive cultured pearl product on the market today rivals the quality of the most expensive natural pearls ever found. This price-value is obvious to consumers as they buy Chinese freshwater bargains. Pearls from freshwater mussels lie at the center of the liveliest activity in pearling today.  In the 1990s, China surprised the market with freshwater pearls that were of much higher quality. The ever-inferior freshwater pearls are now steadily becoming a strong opponent of their saltwater counterparts.   --------------------------------------...      Freshwater Cultured Pearls, are farmed in freshwater and grown in mussels. The irritants and the oysters used in making freshwater pearls are smaller than saltwater pearls. Freshwater pearls cultivating technique usually produce twenty or more pearls in one oyster.     Saltwater Cultured Pearls, are farmed in saltwater, and grown in oysters. Only one pearl is grown per oyster. This makes salt-water pearls more expensive than freshwater pearls. Countries known as producer of saltwater pearl are Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, and Philippines in South East Asia; Australia and Tahiti in South Pacific, especially in Tahiti, you'll find the beautiful black pearls.     The Differences.   The thickness of the nacre coating  Cultured saltwater pearls start with a shell nucleus that is seeded into the oyster. The oysters, over time, secrete a calcium (nacre), which covers this nucleus.     The nacre coating of Japanese Akoya pearls about a half-millimeter.   The nacre coating of Tahitian pearls-about 2 to 3 millimeters.   South Sea pearls develop the thickest-from 2 to 6 millimeters.     Freshwater pearls are all pearl -- this is a big selling point for freshwater pearls. Because there is no hard nucleus inserted in freshwater pearls, freshwater pearls are almost all nacre.     Only South Sea pearls have a nacre coating as thick as that of freshwater pearls. However, for South Sea pearls to have the same thickness nacre coating of a 10mm freshwater pearl a South Sea pearl should be 18mm in size. You will have to spend a small fortune to have it. It only costs a small fraction of that money to buy a 10mm, top quality freshwater pearl.     Colors  Freshwater pearls have a special attraction since they come in a wide range of colors much more variety than seawater pearls. By adding very small quantities of metals to the water on a pearl farm, the colors of freshwater pearls can be very different; many of these colors are not found in saltwater pearls.     Shapes  Freshwater pearls can be found in almost any shape that you can imagine: round, drop, rice, button, oval, semi-round, circle or ringed, baroque and semi-baroque. Because of its popularity, the round shape is usually the most expensive, but as always, personal preference dictates the shape each customer will find most beautiful. In fact, baroque shapes, like the variety of colors, offers beaders more scope, although farmers aim for smooth round cultured pearls.     Cultivation periods  South Sea pearls and Tahitian pearls take 2 to 3 years to form. Japanese Akoya pearls take a shorter period, less than 2 years. The cultivation period for Chinese freshwater pearls in the 1980s was 18 to 24 months. This short time resulted in small sizes and low quality.     Over the past 10 years, Chinese pearl farms have changed their way of cultivating pearls and let their mussels stay in the water for much a longer time. Freshwater pearls take from at least 3 years to as long as 5 to 6 years before they are ready for harvest. Longer cultivation period lead to freshwater pearls that are much bigger in size and higher in quality     Comparable Sizes  New farming techniques and longer cultivation periods have increased the size of freshwater pearls. Large freshwater pearls in the range of 9 to 16 mm are now more common, equivalent to South Sea pearls in size yet more aggressively priced.     Quality  The shapes, surface and luster of new freshwater pearls have already surpassed the original Biwa quality. As testimony to China's achievement, good freshwater pearls are now round enough, clean and lustrous enough to pass as Japanese Akoya and South Sea pearls.|`|6Zf8K3PAaa	freshwater pearls(:  i have a fresh water pearl necklace-  i loveee it(:  xx|`|qOXuKmZnaa	freshwaters are better cuz they are natural. the chemicals in the saltwaters might irratate ur skin.|`|jrB6z23Yaa	freshwater.....for more deails you can read a lot about pearls on bluenile.

Or, wait until it grows out and then cut it at the new growth and try again. This is the same for any type of chemical you put in your hair - texturizer/perm/curl/permanent dye/etc.

eSznVr0Taa	instead of washing it with shampoo everyday just rinse it with coldish water. about twice a week take an over-ripe avocato and a little mayo... mash them together and put it in your hair starting with the ends. let it sit for about a 1/2 hr then rinse it out. only use shapoo on your hair about twice a week.      if you use a spray bottle with beer in it when you style your hair it will help keep it hydrated and shiny. for those days you are not wearing your helmet!    good luck!|`|XkWTsyJdaa	don't use ANY drugstore brand products on your hair especially pantene. trust me. all the stylists say that. if u must, only use paul mitchell. but b&b is best. a little less pricey is on amazon but they dont hav all the same products.    these are all made for dry hair. the "deeep" conditioning treatment works amazingly well. leav it in for 5 minutes in the shower to let it penetrate, then rinse. use a gentle shampoo with it which they also sell called "gentle" shampoo. http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/h...    for intensive need for soft hydrated hair again, i suggest scrolling down the page to the treatment systems. yes, it will end up being expensive, but theyre just as good if not better than salon results.    if u rly cant spend all the money on those 3 products for the treatment, just use the Dehydration Therapy Masque twice to three times a week. just do as the directions say. its pretty much the same as the "deeep" conditioners.|`|xDSScmkDaa	Bye a good conditioning treatment and try not to straighten still. Get it cut, it has to happen!!|`|dz97Jmnkaa	use a really cheap shampoo as this hasn't got many oil's in which should cut down on your greasy hair. Also when you use conditioner only put it on the end of the hair and not at the roots. Make sure you wash out the shampoo and conditiner correctly!!  When you get out of the shower/bath make sure you put serum on damp hair but still of the end of the hair tips. Then when the hair is dry spray with shining spray. This works for me =)|`|7Nln6IJOaa	use a hot oil treatment or deep conditioning treatment from a hair salon.|`|nDAnSuVBaa	I'm sort of the same as you (except for the horses) :P  When conditioning your hair comb it through thoroughly with a wide tooth comb, it gets to every single place and is such an improvement, also when u wash it out only rinse about 85-90% of the conditioner out so it leaves more moisture and makes it shinier.  I've found washing it all out makes it even dryer and rougher.  You can also try a co.wash with just conditioner and no shampoo.  And obviously stop getting it dyed and let your natural colour come through, which is what I'm doing at the moment and it's getting so much better. With me I had it dyed dark when I'm natural blonde, and it didn't suit me, I used something like 10 box dyes in 2 weeks..terrible. Now I'm back blonde and growing my natural colour through.    Good luck :)
zW4c2dyVaa	I have the exact same thing. The thing is is that you have to make sure that you wash out all of the conditioner when you have a shower or bath. Another idea is to deep condition your hair. I suggest olive oil because it has no harsh chemicals that would damage your scalp as well as it leaves your scalp soft. Hope this helps!|`|jIccV2sOaa	Many people recommend oil of parsnip seed rubbed into the scalp and washed out using the water from boiling carrots (lots of vitamins).  Others swear by camphor desolved in olive oil.|`|wY684dvHaa	eww beautiful..........  anti dandruff shampoo..  as for the scabz eww and try not to sratch|`|3z0LgzLQaa	That kinda sounds like Eczema.

6jW5L3Vqaa	Hey ;)    I don't know where the shirt came from, and neither does the clothes stylist who picked it for the show (Edward Gibbon) - "the guy who picks and devises the looks in Skins".    He said (about that shirt..) "His polo shirt is my first favourite in this episode, can't remember where I got it from but its a brilliant piece of..."     You can find out the rest of what Ed said here;  http://www.e4.com/skins/style/edwards-ed...    It's probably from somewhere like Topman or Burton thought, like the girl above this answer said ;)    If you ever wanna know where any of the other clothes come from that are used on the show, check out http://www.e4.com/skins/ and look under 'Style' (left hand side).     Hope it helps!|`|x8Io7ENXaa	topman most probably :)

QJrDJsgxaa	Have the end of your hair trimmed regularly.  And if you use straighteners or curling tongs, try not to use them as much : )|`|aJFVCGOgaa	Get a trim every 4-6 weeks and avoid to much heat styling. Don't brush your hair when wet comb it instead  x|`|58THMcy5aa	Trim it.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	Once they are split you have to get them cut off, just go to the hairdressers!|`|JL9Nwgvwaa	Sadly you can't, you just have to get them cut.  However I use Mark Hill split end mender and that works a treat to stop split ends getting worse and if you use them after you cut your hair then it really helps to prevent you getting them.    *Angel*|`|GTjkWZPlaa	My sister is a hairdresser.  The only way to get rid of split ends is to cut them off.  Getting regular trims every 4 - 6 weeks is a good idea to help keep your hair healthy.|`|eSznVr0Taa	you have to cut them off. they will not repair themselves.    after cutting them off to avoid having it happen again...  use a mayo and avocato treatment once or twice a week for about 15-30 minutes then rinse.    do not shampoo your hair more than 3 times in a week.|`|vVlD8rYqaa	Hate to say it but the only thing you can do is trim it|`|zKJ7d8o3aa	VO5 makes a great split ends shampoo and conditioner|`|LmUSfHXkaa	Get a hair cut.|`|EiuRCypqaa	lather the ends of your hair with conditionerner that repairs your hair you can buy it at your local drugstore
y3jAbQYKaa	Ok, sounds like your trying to do a french manicure polish.   Paint the white part; let it dry.. after its done drying add the clear ontop.  Usually at work or any professional nail salon, after we put the white we add a clear pink under it (make sure it doesnt touch the white) to even it out, then add the clear top coat. =) hope I helped!!|`|QvhPJAKyaa	ou just gotta make sure ou let each laer dr properl.  it does take a long time, soo be patient :) x

It's illegal if you're not 18.|`|TudZYPN5aa	mhm, like they won't notice a second set of holes?  riiiighhhttt.  good luck with that one.    as far as i know, you have to have parental consent if you're under 18.  if they don't get consent, it's illegal.|`|qyU9kVDpaa	no. just go with a friends parents or an aunt or uncle or something and tell them there your parents. or just dont shut up about until your parents let u. thats what i did. lol. except i got it done in 5th grade.|`|2l9XUq4caa	go to claries|`|vILQvJlmaa	Gosh........ur parents r strict........ummmmmmm..................... im not sure u could forge it i guess..............sorry:(|`|AA10971419	claires. and its free|`|vi42aJbvaa	You could get an over 18 to say there your parent/guardian , but dont do it ur self whatever you do its too risky

I love how the clothing pieces give it a rocker look but then the jewelry softens it up a little bit and shows a more feminine side to the outfit! I also love how the bag shows a different color on the whole outfit!|`|Vd0PEtdWaa	Tear it    The ripped jeans, and converse are not a very feminine look.

The sweat shirt just looks like its shaped weird.

Very cute!|`|0pY9smlqaa	Wear it...|`|YjkXyHBuaa	tear it :[  just so plain!  where's the color?|`|CDdXuRi9aa	Wear it. But I'm not too fond of the bag. It's okay though.

The black shoes are so cute too!
fco4Hl2gaa	You're beautiful the way you are. I don't think you feel that way though.. So my tip on how to improve it is to see what everyone else (who is normal and sees how beautiful you are and is able to get past their own wishes to make themselves feel better by putting others down) sees. Don't pay attention to anyone who gives you anything less than a 10, you're beautiful in all your own ways and that's perfect.|`|00P38FKraa	you are a 5 out of 10 in my eyes.|`|VV5KZjGRaa	4/10    Think it would be better if you lost that weird thing you do with your mouth...seems like a nervous habit|`|q7XSr1Lgaa	Your very pretty.  8.5/10|`|m0kQMWYeaa	id so love to have your hair naturaly id love those type of curls  urm about 8-ish out of 10 your very pretty|`|AA10458195	You have beautiful eyes and I would rate you a nine.|`|1sfYOZNbaa	8/10 you really pretty. you hair looks good curly and staightened, but you should smile in the pictures instead of making that face|`|YjkXyHBuaa	4.8/10  being honest :]    tips?  wear makeup to cover up your undereye circles.  mine are worse than yours and i cover them up really well.   & mascara.|`|tE1aoQpfaa	5|`|KJOHgMznaa	attractive.  but,i am sure these pix were taken in your dads office because you look to young to have a job! lucky you!|`|JWa78QVoaa	You look good to me.  7/10.  I agree about the nervous mouth thing though.  One last thing, who cares what we think.|`|Gf8Hi4Pbaa	7/10  you need some eyeliner and mascara|`|wY684dvHaa	9/10     mabye get more layers in your hair  eyeliner  and dont be self counious its the inside that counts|`|5r48jn7iaa	your pretty|`|3Td329n7aa	I like the curly..it's fuller and suits you...if you want to wear it straight to mix it up I recommend a little teasing at the roots to give you a little fuller hair.     I'm not sur ehow old you are, but you don't have a bad look...just seems a little on the younger/fresher side :)|`|zsBwkBi4aa	10! = ]  Your so beautiful!  I love your hair, it's so pretty.  xoxoxo -Liz|`|xY6aRTziaa	i will prefer it curly. you look better with you're curly hair. it makes you look more alive. trust me, you look nice.
11PFFVtJaa	www.KidzBrandz.com.au has a whole range of US-brand kids clothes including Gap, Osh Kosh, Carters, Levis, Nike, Adidas, etc.  And if you spend $75 on their website it's free postage. I personally think the quality of US-brand clothing is much better than most Australian-made (read, China-made) stuff. :-)

However there are a number of things you can do  You can cut your hair basically layer it a lot so it it shorter at the top of your hair then its less likely to just lay flat on your head.  After you wash your hair you can apply some volumising mousse and dry your hair upside down and make sure you don't brush your hair down .. make sure you brush it up so you lift it up.  At the end use some strong holding hairspray which adds volume.  After I do all that my hair is usually standing and not flat  so just calm it down a bit so it doesn't look all big and scary just make sure you don't flatten it again. Hope this helped|`|bit5P4Dwaa	wash ad towel dry then put in some hair moose before drying!    it always creates a boost and will provide lots of volume!    it's magic............works every time!

I use colours which bring out my face, i don't really like the plastic orange look so bringing out your eyes i think is the most important.

5HS07bQkaa	It's impossible to tell, as we don't know how much you're applying/how the colours look against your skin tone etc.    It sounds ok to me, though. Just make sure you're not applying the eyeliner too thickly, and that the bronzer is a natural shade (as opposed to dark brown or orange).    Good Luck!|`|5Mc0HLesaa	i think i wouldn't do the lip gloss!    but i think the rest is just fine if you don't overdo it!|`|NEkXzGQoaa	I'm not sure about lip gloss, It looks fine on some girls; but it makes others look like white trash D:  But seeing as I read and answered your question about the trashy girls that wear orange makeup, I'm pretty sure you have the same opinion as me to do with the subject of whore makeup, so I doubt your lipgloss looks trashy :D  The rest of your makeup sounds fine, nice and natural.|`|PWkWptVuaa	It sounds fine - just the right amount, but I dont know how you apply it.

Dm3AHmG5aa	Well judging by your picture your Caucasian, Is that correct? I think it's a different process, but for blacks we usually section the hair and twist it with your fingers or a small toothed comb. We also use a locking gel or bee's wax to hold the lock until the hair starts locking on it's own. And if you do it yourself it can literally be an all day process. With blacks they are permanent, so all the hair would have to be cut off, at least to the new growth that has not locked. I went to college with a few white people that had some but they said they just stopped combing their hair, theirs also had no formation, as fair as neatness I think its best to separate the hair and just continuously twist it around your fingers until it becomes tangled. I re do my boyfriends locks every other weekend but his are already locked, I just touch up his new growth.|`|6nkc1N0kaa	they'd probly look good on u and to get them out u can brush them out or (if ur lucky) ur hair stylist will brush them out|`|cLGmnUcgaa	we have a substitute teahcer whos hair is dreadlocked, it looks cute on her. just dont brush your hair. but wash it frequently. looser dreadlocks lok better than the super tight ones, at least if toyur a girl, all i know to remove them is cut ur hair..... look it up on google.|`|rNSGZBB2aa	this is the most dumbest question on here!!! :)|`|UByvC54Xaa	Check out this great forum www.dreadlockforums.com  I also have a yahoo group which is just starting but has a good bit of information - http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dre...

f4eda0c37979ae89ad204ab693187592aa	It's hard to explain without actually showing you, but here's my best effort.  Can do 1 french braid down the middle? If you can, then 2 is the same way, except you do one on each side. Part your hair equally down the middle and secure 1 side in a ponytail. So basically half of your hair is in a ponytail, and the other half is loose. Now, french braid the loose hair like this:  This is the best way I can personally describe it (in my own words, not from a website)....    Grab your hair like you're putting it 1/2 up and then with your thumbs and index fingers divide the "half up" section into 3 equal parts.    Cross the left section over the center one, and then cross the right section over the new center one (which used to be on the left.)    Now grab a section of hair from the left side of your head, and add it to the left section of the braid, and cross that over the center part of the braid.    Then, you do the same thing on the right side - add a section of loose hair from the right side of your head to the right section of the braid and cross that over the center piece of the braid.    From that point just repeat that process until the braid goes down to the bottom of your head and you run out of hair.    Then you can continue braiding the tail into a regular braid and secure it.    Next, take down the other side of your secured hair and french braid it the same way!    It looks really tough at first by watching it, but once you practice you'll get the hang of it.    Hope my directions helped! Kind of difficult to explain without showing you. It gets easier after practicing a few times. If you have any questions email me ~Amanda|`|qggJT2H8aa	Take a 3-inch-long by 1-inch-wide section of your hair just above the forehead or behind your bangs. Divide the section into three even pieces which will start off your French braid.     Step2  Wrap your left thumb around the left section, palm facing front, fingers sticking straight up. Mimic the same posture on the right side, and let the middle section lie against the head.     Step3  Make a soft fist around the left section of hair, turning your hand so that your fingers rest on the head. Bring the section of hair in your right hand across the middle section and hook it with your left index finger.     Step4  Lead with the right thumb and cut about a 1-inch section of hair straight across the head, starting at the hairline and moving toward the middle section. Collect the middle section and pull all of the hair tight. The line of hair you collected in each section of your French braid should lie flat and smooth.     Step5  Make a soft fist with the right hand, fingers facing your scalp. Reach the right index finger over the middle section and hook the section of hair that's in your left fist. Pull it out gently, keeping a firm grip on the French braid sections in your right hand.     Step6  Let the section in your left hand dangle. Lead with the left thumb and cut about a 1-inch section of hair straight across the head, collect the middle section, then pull all of the hair tight. Turn the fist so that your fingers face your scalp.     Step  7Extend your left index finger to hook the section of hair that's in your right fist. Continue until the French braid is complete.|`|WT108qwZaa	get three strands of hair then lap one over they other then add more hair to each strand

kT7akcE6aa	I'm a regular at Lush.  This past summer I won the local "Lush Town" contest they were having and went home with over 15kg of soap! haha    I have a tonnn of massage bars.  My favourite is the "each peach.." because it's good to wake you up in the morning.  There's also a hexagonal one that smells like white chocolate (and tastes like it too ;] ) called Mange Too and a vanilla one with red lips on it (called Fever).  God, I'm sorry I can't remember the names!  Go on their website and you'll know the ones I mean!  I tend to rub them all over after a bath because aside from being massage bars, they're very slick and hydrating too.  I especially love rubbing them over my legs after shaving - my legs are SO soft since I started going to Lush!  So these things are definitely multipurpose!    My favourite bath soap is "Honey I Washed The Kids" by far!  It's so sweet smelling, a mixture of like honey and toffee.  I could eat it!  I also love their Snow Fairy shower gel, which is bright pink and smells like candy.  The scent reminds me of something from childhood but I can't quite place it, so bathtime is always nostalgic now.    I also have to say that their Pumpkin soap has a special place in my heart.  It smells just like spicy pumpkin pie, which I love and get homesick for (I live in the UK now, but grew up in Canada, and Pumpkin pie was always a fall-time staple that I miss now).    I also love the Rockstar soap.  Super yummy smelling and has a hint of glitter too    I think all of the products I listed are pretty inexpensive.    I also recommend the yellow Bath Ballistic called Honey Bee.. it's a complimentary scent to the Honey I Washed The Kids soap, super yummy smelling and makes my skin feel soft afterward.  (I have to say I love the smell so much that I actually own the solid perfume they made with the same scent as the soap haha)|`|yzOtKTJIaa	I love lush!    Ok...    1: Best to use by warming up in your hands then smoothing on.  Shimmy shimmy can be abit gritty cos of the glitter but just get it to body tempreture and you will be fine.  The soft couer is best shared with a speial someone ;-)  2. Best soap has to be Honey I washed the Kids, smells devine you could eat yourself up!    3: I love the soap i mentioned above and also the 'you snap the whip' body butter which smells gorgeous and fruity.      I have tried most lush things and those are my fave.|`|5oNwMqMiaa	Hiya,  I love lush but don't get to go there often because my boyfriend hates the smell and thinks he gets a headache from it (yeah, right!).  I have used the massage bar that looks like a bar of chocolate - yum!  Make sure your hands are warm and melt a bit of the bar on your hands, then use it just like an oil.  Beware of getting it on clothes and make your subject lie on a warm towel, lovely!  I loved a sparkly soapy bar they used to make, but the porridge soap is good for every skin type.  Bath bombs are a lovely treat too, champagne supernova and the heart shaped one that leaves petals in your bath are nice every so often.  The best products I have found to make a difference are snake oil, a massage for the scalp and helps with all sorts of scalp issues.  Wash off with a shampoo bar of your choice!    A common thought is that shampoo has to foam to make your hair clean but this isn't true, I recommend the shampoo bars highly especially as all the lush products don't contain any harsh chemicals and their magazine is packed with success stories.  Long live lush!  Good question!  :-)|`|0eJ0o4heaa	1.Get some lavender in your bath.  2.Go to the lush shop.  3.By all of the lush.  4.Get bubble bath with notes in.  5.|`|WZlKy4Vgaa	For...  1. Get the massage bar and put it in your hands and rub it around in your hands, this makes the oils melt and get warm better for massaging, then because it's warm apply it to the rest of your body, it's better to use it after a warm bath or shower because it works better with nice soft skin. The bars melt at 40 degrees so make sure it's nice and warm in your hands.  One massage bar that smells so nice is nutts.    2. I think the best soap from lush is Rockstar, when i bought all my family loved the smell and so did my friends. The smell also stays on your skin so you smell great for ages.  For a bubble (bath) bars is either the comforter the berry smell is lovely and it turns your water bright pink or frosty glitter this is pink and smells so nice, it also makes your water glittery and your skin too.    3. My favorite product is the face masks cupcake is my favorite because it smells like cocoa and is especially for teen-aged skin so it keeps my skin in control.    Look at the bubble bars and stuff i mentioned on the site   https://www.lush.co.uk/index.php?option=...    Hope this helps :)|`|355e7824f276b6c691ef34823338dea3aa	well i hope you have a partner to share the massage bar as thats the best way, i have a xmas one, and each peach twos a pear bar, both are nice, warm up in ands and massage in as you would any cream or oil  i tried the snake oil head massage bar that just made my hair greasy to be honest  best soaps i have used is angel cake as it smells fab and looks good too, i also have honey i washed the kids, good simple non fussy soap  i prefer bath jelly as its versatile, use as bubble bath, shower gel or freeze it, the sweetie pie is almost edible (i think its called sweetie pie? its purple and glittery)  top lush product is snow fairy shower gel sadly only available winter though i do stock up  imperial leather foam burst shower gels smell great, i like anything that smells sweet or fruity, especially coconut and lime

OJn8QwEZaa	I love those brands (besides Abercrombie -- too expensive, and plus they discriminate a lot), I also like plain things too. Some no name brand clothes can be cute, I wear them as long as they're in style.    American Eagle, Hollister Co., PINK Victoria's Secret have cute things but, I'm not going to wear them because, of the name on it. It has to be cute too .    I love Juicy Couture and Betsey Johnson.|`|jUWOMgyuaa	It's Hollister, and American Eagle     And girls wear them because they make nice clothes  I'm pretty sure, you can't go to Wal-Mart and find the same thing

O_O|`|nsVbWXKraa	she pry just wanted to spend the time with you and watch that specific movie.... I think ur friends coming over topped it off though and she was angry and her friends were just trying to calm her down... does she LIKE u?|`|AkSSf3tVaa	Ahm...okay translation:    She likes you and you just bought your friends along to your date. 'Twilight' is kinda a romantic film and well, I suppose it would have been better to create a certain mood than 'yes-man' does.    She was upset and called her friend, they went to the bathroom to talk and analyse YOU and discuss why men a r so complicated and than she probably fixed her face.    Got it?|`|57X92zknaa	This sounds pretty simple: she probably has feelings for you. It's hard for her to deal with them because you've been friends for so long.    Haha, I know we're weird! And I don't know why, we probably just think too much, or in a too complicated way.|`|AH8YRRI8aa	*sigh* Do I really need to translate this?  I'm kinda hoping you're a) making this up or b) 10 years old.  Oh well... here goes:  She likes you... Twilight is romantic... I guess (havn't seen it) and she wanted to go with you ALONE.  Her friends were there for support in case things went wrong.  They did.  They went to the bathroom to discuss you, how you were insensitive, and you you didn't understand her feelings.  She's not going to break into a confession of love in front of your friends, so she stayed quiet, probably hoping you'd figure out what was wrong. And that's about it.  Anything else I can help you with? It sounds like a plot for a bad Disney tv show...  :)|`|K4ml1oSJaa	Uh huh  Life's like this  Uh huh, uh huh  That's the way it is  'Cause life's like this  Uh huh, uh huh  That's the way it is    Chill out, what you yellin' for?

Or she probably wanted to be more than friends.  And maybe she was talking to her friends in there for advice since you screwed it all up.|`|tCNP6bbeaa	men are from mars and women are from...? Venus..    She is falling for u man,u don't get it right..    Take her out at a nice calm place,not scary calm.Walk n talk would let u know tht what she feels is not the same-although ur childhood friend ;)    if u fine proceeding further then take the above step else don't dare to do so..u might end up hurting her.    So try being normal n casual with her..she might still keep behaving like this as she gets emotional n attached with u but u have to still be normal n fine with her if she is not the one for u she would understand it slowly.    Rest up to u,get back if u req further help :)    Cheers.|`|mL64wlQ4aa	she probs like you    either that or shes an attention seeker|`|Y0uy51eVaa	WE ARE NOT  YOU BOYS ARE....U DONT CARE ABOUT HOW GIRLS FEEL!!!    YOU BOYS ARE HARD 2 WORK OUT B COZ U DONT SAY HOW U FEEL    EMOTIONS SCARE BOYS....AND GIRLS HAVE A LOT OF THEESE|`|KOxWQtotaa	seriously, she probably likes you and she might have spent all that time in the bathroom fixing herself up for you.|`|7vOvJdRqaa	Ummmmmm Well girls arent that complicated...   They just take some understanding....   Firstly... Twilight, its quite a romantic film... so maybe, just maybe she thought it was more a "date" situ, which is why she got mad when you brought your friends along, and why she got really upset if you suggested another film.   And her friends might have been there for support cos she thought it was something more than just a movie...  In the bathroom - well its a girls sanctury, its the only place we can talk with our friends without a guy walking in and getting the wrong end of the stick... soooo they were probably talking about the "date" or you and maybe consoling her if she was upset about it all...  And its hard to explain because she doesnt want to admit she likes you because she's shy maybe?  I dont know the girl but it seems that way.... :)  Hope this helps!|`|4vpK2qFYaa	Well, Twilight is a love thing she might have a thang for you, And she got pissed when she found out you wernt allone.  The Yes Man is a comady, That is not really good on dates more like friends    Girls go in the bathroom when they don't want to face life, There upset, or they dont likew how the day turned out|`|8KBYpo7Eaa	LOL. Your last sentence was awesome. Well, its obvious that she likes you more than a friend. And she went to the bathroom to tell all her girlfriends about how she was so pissed that you brought your guy friends and you changed the movie. I think twilight is one of those weird romantic movies. I haven't seen it and it look stupid, but that's what I got from the previews. Anyways, she likes you and wants to spend time with you alone and she was pissed that you ruin her beautifully planned evening. It's hard for her to explain cuz she doesnt want to tell you she likes you because she is nervous about it. That about sums it up. Maybe you should ask her out to a movie and take her to see twilight to make it up to her.|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	yaramyriel said it all =) and so did a couple of others.     haha girl do many things in the bathroom. just think, no boys get to hear what their saying =)|`|2DK4QoV9aa	i think yaramyriel got it bang on the point lol|`|kr0IgpDeaa	BECAUSE GOD CREATED MEN!|`|0PsnnVb6aa	now thats an easy one: she likes you and shes not gonna say that in front of your friends...twilight is romantic...a great setting for the mood and/or feel and her friends are there to help her and shes in the bathroom fixing herself up for you...and you say you're acting weird...shes probably saying the same thing to her friends...ask her if she likes you or better ask her out !! i bet she'll be like reaally happy..

pbVPS24zaa	What they said above. Ebay however if you want to put it up for a price. I would start out high first to see if you can get anyone to buy try 600? Then in a week no one buys lower it to 550. Keep taking of 50 until you hit 350. 350 should be the lowest you would go.|`|QgHo4Mvtaa	ebay or on amazon|`|8411085d73dfc634c33d30af14909a59aa	Ebay it.|`|T7AmRfZQaa	yeah just ebay it but make sure you take some detailed pictures so the person buying it knows what they are getting
KvZutMEZaa	Use modelling agencies - professional and people won't get the wrong idea.    I found some good ones for teen starters:    http://www.modelsdirect.com/    www.jurgita.com/    www.modelscouts.com/teen_models.html    Remember, rejection is a part of being a model. Even the best models in the world were rejected at points in their lives. It takes time and willpower. Try and try again - don't give up.    Good luck, hope everything works out.|`|5xgcKSbjaa	If you want to be a model, and you don't have the courage to walk up to a modeling agent, how are you ever gonna have the courage to walk down the runway? You gotta understand that models get critisized, even the super-super models...If YOU think you got the stuff, and otehr people are *telling* you you got it, then you probably have got a chance! So don't worry about something that hasn't even happened yet, go to an agent, show them your pics or whatever, and take it from there.  If they reject you, try a different agent, because maybe you weren't what they were looking for, not because there is anything wrong with you.    An' just keep trying.  You gotta have confidence in yourself, that's also what they look for.   You never know until you try..|`|AA11259815	Dont dress sl***y, they'll deny you immediately. They want your figure and a natural beauty. They go by your waist size and you have to be at least 5' 9" I believe (5' 11" for guys). They want to see how you would fit in a dress.    It will cost you upfront to have an agency represent you. It cost me $1000 plus $20 a month to subscribe to their web site (where offers and oppurtunities are found).    Modeling isnt as great as you think. It doesnt pay what you think. You'll get offers in your state for example you'll have to drive 2 hours away and be paid $12 an hour and "model" for like 6 hours for some mall. Other offers will have you drive an hour away just to TRY OUT for a modeling gig. You'll receive offers from MTV, Discovery, even clothing and perfume ads, but these are all try outs out of hundreds of people. It could end up being a waste of time.    Also. If you're gonna model, you need to be social! When you do your first job you're gonna want a portfolio sorta thing with your pictures, your name and address, phone number and hand them out to the people that are representing some business. You have to advertise yourself. So you're gonna need that personality and not be afraid to be out there.    And because you're 16, youre gonna need a ride to and from these places cause you wont find anything locally unless you're in the city.     My advice ... if you want to make a career out of this, find an agency to represent you. Otherwise you can represent yourself. Make your own portfolio and mail them to certain companies. I find the only purpose of an agency is to spread your portfolio to all of its affiliates. Companies cant find you directly of course, so they go to these agencies to find you. Instead you can go the other route and contact them. Having experience increases your offers so build yourself.    If I was able to help you I would. By creating "cards" to mail to certain companies cause you dont need an agency. I used to model by the way. Its a cool experience but it wasnt worth my time. Its only worth it if youre contracted with that company (instead of a one-time gig) or a foreign country like Italy wants ya, they'll pay for everything.    Also understand these are big businessmen and they are picky on what they're looking for. Modeling will throw some ********* at ya. They're not afraid to tell you no to your face and turn their back on ya. You have to treat it like a business and you are a product of it. Dont let your feelings be hurt cause what one company may not like about you, another may love. It has nothing to do with you personally, its just what they need specifically for whatever product they want you to advertise. But most of the people you run into are friendly, they'll accept and review your pictures.     It will take some time to get yourself launched. Dont expect to make much money your first year. You'll know when the oppurtunity comes. But the more effort you put into it, the better you will do. And there are different types of modeling. You could do runway, you could do print (magazines), you could do small gigs for a local mall (wearing a bikini in front of the store during summer). And runway pays best. Thats all the advice I can give ya =).|`|TtMKPBR3aa	you surely don't want the wrong type of attention so use a modeling agency|`|dU5RD79Paa	Just do what you have to, don't think about anything else, or else you'll never reach your goal.|`|u7nRWq33aa	ok i too was a barbie model when i was still 12 years old (am18 now). ok, what i did was to go to mattel, had the courage to ask if i can be a part of their ramp models. so they ask me to do the catwalk, sing and dance.! that was it! voila! and much to my surprise they let me join barbie pageant and i became the princess barbie.   i won it.. just be confident.

B3SyHdiQaa	It depends on how much you wash your hair.  It may not last more than 2 wks, but if it came out lighter it may not last that long.  My daughter is a natural blonde and her hair does not hold "red" pigment  at all.  One particular red shade washed out very quickly.  Red shades are the fastest color to fade.  One trick if you want  red color to hold is ask your stylist to add some "grey drops".  Grey drops  are used on grey hair (resitant to holding color)and help to hold color better.  http://www.reflectionshairdesigns.com

ealVW30gaa	First of all it is ok to wear pantyhose with open toe shoes.  All of the latest fashion magazines show the models wearing them.  Heck, InStyle Magazine even wrote about it being "in" now.    Since it is a wedding I would definitely wear 'hose and probably a nude shade.  You can cover up your tattoo with some foundation if you want.    L'eggs Sheer Energy has a couple of shades (nude and suntan) that may work (plus they only cost $5/pair) depending on your skin tone and how much tattoo coverage you want.|`|st5reHVjaa	if the bride said that it's okay, then it's fine.  maybe wear leggings if it covers ur tattoo  but dark blue (navy) would be better (or even black)  or skin/nude color would be best|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	I'd do whatever the bride says because it's all about her that day but it does depend on the color of the dress. I wouldn't wear black if the dress is a light color because that would be tacky. I think you should be fine.|`|lUPyZgtzaa	yh think they look cool and sexy but u have to have a fit body to pull it off . and nice legs and have to be quiet young looking but other than that if you tick all the boxes than its a yes   good luck x|`|l95ndpTWaa	I think it would look fairly frumpy myself.    I'd go with nude stockings and, if the bride were concerned about your tattoo, use foundation and coverup on your leg before putting the stockings on.  She'll thank you for the fashion sense later when the pictures come out.    Make sure you're coordinating with the bridesmaids, too.|`|CLUefeqNaa	why would you want to hide your tattoo?    if the bride asked you to do this then you can wear light tockings with a dark band around your tattoo (if its small)...if not then you;re going to have to look frumpy for your friends wedding (sorry)

v6KI6iygaa	GHD straighteners get your hair the straightest when straightening and are fantastic for curling! They heat up in less than 60 seconds, and can reach 230 degrees celcius.  Make sure you use heat protection spray though sweetie! Good luck :)|`|p3GZERIsaa	Yes :]|`|bMe86cwSaa	As a hairdresser with 10 years experience I have used many different types of hair straighteners.

I don't use anything else, nor does any other hairdresser I know.|`|WNsjy5oFaa	yes without a doubt|`|rxqZ1nLgaa	Yeah, very good straighteners because they get really hot. Careful they don't burn your carpet though!|`|ZUq54bhsaa	yes they're very good but they can damage your hair quickly so use heat protection spray =]|`|bit5P4Dwaa	yes they are really good!worth the money for sure!:)  they work on all types of hair and are truly the vest straighteners round!  they don't damage hair and leave it silky and smooth.    they work fast and will last for a really long time.    i  got one about 4 months ago and i am happy i did because it is noticeably brilliant i get loads of compliments and i use it every week!:)    all my friends and people i know have one and i've never heard a complaint about them.i guess the only bad thing is that they are expensive enough but totally worth the money!    trust me and buy on don't look back!    oh and you can also do waves,curls and volumise with a ghd!:)    well worth it!  xxx    hope this has helped.                EXTRA INFORMATION=another bonus is that you can get then in so many cute colours (black,pink,purple!!)
VK7QmqYqaa	Heyah, well my hairs thick and curly but its blonde !. when i go to the hair dressers i have what i need off and i have it thinned out because although u might want it long if you dont have the right amount of it goes even more frizy. i think it looks nice if you put it in a messy bun, like this ;  http://farm1.static.flickr.com/20/706577...   [its quite easy to do, and its quick!]  or mabey wet it and scrunch it? if you have straightoners, if i really cant be bothered i straighten the top og my hair and put it in a pony, so the bit pulled back isn't all sticking out with frizzyness ! lol.  well there are some ideas. hoped it helped (: x|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	Unfortunately, I think you're only solution would be to chop it off. You want a good style but you don't want to have to use products or take much time tending to it, that doesn't leave you with much options. Or you could go to a salon and have them chemically straighten it for you. This will last a decent amount of time, and you wouldn't even need to blow dry it every morning.

There's a cream that comes spiraled in a mousse-like container, which she uses before scrunching (even in dry hair) and a spray. Nothing else really worked for her before.     She's Filipina.
dyGcZYQaaa	Yeah you could totally pull them off.     But I'd agree with getting snakebites, or maybe viperbites. They're killurr.  :]      Although in my school, lip piercings and monroes have become overly popular.

I like Remmington Wet 2 Straight, but I've also heard good things about Sedu and Chi. I'd recommend you get a straightening shampoo and conditioner like Ion. (it's available at Sally's Beauty Supply) You may want to consider getting your hair chemically straightened at a salon, but it can be expensive and damaging. Get a straightening mousse, gel, or hairspray to help your hair stay straight. Hope I helped! :)

1y1c5QWHaa	Straightening your hair will make your bangs stick to your forehead.  Take a round brush and while the brush is in your bangs, hairspray it, (unless it's wet). That will make your bangs bend out quite a bit, so they will no longer sticker to your forehead.  If your hair's wet when you want to bend your bangs, you can blow-dry over it, but I don't recommend that because blow drying your hair makes it frizzy, and it wastes energy, but it does dry your hair really fast. It's your choice whether or not you want to blow-dry it.      Hope this helps you!|`|3kmSpP2aaa	cut them to your eyebrow or just below, and then take a big round brush and blow dry them in front of your face. don't straighten them because it makes them look longer and it will make them static-y and that will make them stick to your face.|`|sJHCOgjfaa	well wash your hair in the morning other than evening. when u sleep where your hair in a bun dont were it dwn. could get it shaped in to your face if u like it dwn. maybe curl you hair which will take attention off of them an on your curls. xx
beo6SxSIaa	I would deep cleanse it once a week ( with special shampoo ) use gentle shampoo and conditioner otherwise.

I would just find anything that tames frizz.|`|QwHLZaS6aa	before you straighten it, (or curl it) just use that stuff u spray on to protect it(you can get it ur local drugdstore or beuty supply), and dont straighten it more than 3 times a week if you can!  if you have to have it straight everyday, dont wash it everyday, or dont get it wet.  that way its still straight for the next day!

UByvC54Xaa	Thankyou Deep! The first informative, non-stereotypical a$$ to actually answer a question with some knowledge.    Dreadlocks are not expensive money-wise and you can make most of your own dread-care products. But they are costly in time - that is if you want healthy, well looked after gorgeous dreadlocks. They have 3 stages, baby, tenage and mature. As babies - they require lots of time and care and it is not unusual to spend more than 10 hours a week maintaining them. Once made, you will need to root rub, palmroll, crochet the tips or rub the tips (depends what look you are after), wash your dreadlocks! and apply any products if you choose to use any.    Backcombing is the most popular method for caucasian hair. You need to start with clean, residue-free hair (you will need to invest in a non-residue soap when you have dreadlocks. Popular dread ones are dreadheadhq and knottyboy, I have actually been reading up on pure black soap and am considering using this for my dreadlocks). You will also need a metal lice comb and some snag-free rubberbands to section your hair. After sectioning, you then backcomb very slowly and an inch at a time. Once finished you palmroll.    I wouldnt worry about getting it done professionally. Save your money and invest in some headwraps (you need to sleep with your dreads wrapped) and non-residue shampoo and other products like dread wax should you wish to use it.    For a lot more information on sectioning, backcombing, crocheting, washing and other useful tips and recipes - please join my group http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/dre...

This site tells how...    http://www.ehow.com/how_2309138_grow-dre...|`|nDQOwAA3aa	just don't wash your hair and thats how you get them pretty cheap|`|IGXE3aDraa	TO DREAD HAIR YOU NEED CLEAN HAIR, UNWASHED HAIR IS A MISCONCEPTION AND A STEREOTYPE. dread locks don't cost very much, but are a long journey. you start with back combing where you take a medal comb and tease the hair. then you twist twist twist. go to http://www.dreadheadhq.com for a detailed section on dreading hair. they also have something called lock pepper and lock accelerator and these will help get it locked up quickly. also dreaded hair you want to use a shampoo that doesn't have things like silicone's and de-tanglers like most of the shampoos in the store have. they have a shampoo on the web site I've used for years and it works great. most products you will need are around 10 to 15 bucks depending on what your getting. i spend about 30 ever 5 or 6 months depending. the shampoo i usually water down a little bit because its really thick. also because the shampoo is with out additives you want to go to the health food store and get essential oils (your choice of fragrance, I use lavender, many smells help the body with certain things) anyway put about 6 drops in a spray bottle with water, and spray dreads lightly, your hair will always smell nice. remember there is a lot of twist, but since your in school just do it while teachers are doing lectures. they have some bands and things to put on your dreads to help them lock up. I have metal ones now, but when I started I found the hemp ones really helpful (10 bucks for a 10 pack)  because you could change the size. make sure you plan out do you want little ones or big ones. also you will hear from some people that dread locks are dirty, well any hair can be dirty, even un-dreaded hair. if you look into what is in shampoo and conditioner you will be less likely to buy the stuff at the grocery store. the dread shampoo is much better for the hair and scalp. people will also tell you dumb things like koolaide or mayo will help and that's just plain stupid don't listen to them they don't know what they are talking about. the cleaner your dreads are the faster they will lock up. also the guy who said you will have no love life is sooo wrong :) good luck on your journey.|`|84lw8pLoaa	don't wash your hair..dreads are nasty|`|n5NltZVGaa	Dreadlocks cost nilch.  You don't wash, don't comb and you grow your hair out to be about two feet long, evenly.  Then, you hold your hair up in a strand and comb backwards, against the grain.  Soak your head in cold water, dry it off and twist long clumps of it.  Beware, you'd better have no desire for a love life of any kind, considering the smell, dandruff and lice, flees from dogs, and dirt trailing down your neck and chest and back and arms at all times in any humid, or rainy environment, or if you sweat at all.

lIpjuMTHaa	Red is the hardest color to keep. It washes out the fastest no matter what. You have to use a color protectant shampoo but even then it doesnt stay long. Do it though. Its worth a shot. Your hairdresser will talk to you about the different options of how to go about it. Just go somewhere with a really good color specialist.|`|wVJ4PJJXaa	I do not think they would need to bleach your hair to dye it red.  Red, like blonde is very high maintenance, cause it washes out so easily, and once it does it tends to look trashy.      The best thing to do is purchase shampoo and conditioners for girls that have RED color treated hair.  Brands like John Frieda and Redken work best.     Be prepared though to go to the colorist at least every 6-8 weeks for touch ups.

If you really want to go that colour that bad then bleach it then dye it red.

Black, red, and white are all fine colors but they're too predictable- and they pretty much will look hideous with anything you wear.    Pick other colors (I don't know what's available but there HAVE to be other combinations you could go for) and keep the style- they're worth the price as long as you pick a better color combination.|`|ToZ3qXBYaa	neva in a million years|`|4k5AAm8Daa	no!|`|nfn93q2Yaa	Their not worth it.

SHARt1k3aa	It depends if this is for evening or day?  If it's evening I would go for navy shoes, or even a different color to make the dress pop.  Like you could wear a red shoe.  If it's a day event, white would be fine.  The color Navy is fine for February, it's the polka dots that may make the dress a little informal, but I don't know how formal your event is either.  Being that the dress has polka dots, very little accessories.  A bracelet maybe.  It depends what kind of neckline you have if you wear a necklace or not.  You're really too vague to get an accurate answer.  sorry.

I went to Ann Taylor last fall too, and I think I know the dress you're talking about! I think it's beautiful. But the polka dots should be big.

coxuYcOjaa	OK, I'm a guy, but I cannot help answering this WONDERFUL question!    I agree with Nicole, L'eggs Sheer Energy are truly outstanding and quite silky and sexy. Victoria's Secret have discontinued the "Body by Victoria" pantyhose which my ex-girlfriend and I both loved. They have been replaced with a new name, but I don't have enough experience with them to give you advice. Donna Karan have nice pantyhose as well.    You might try crotchless pantyhose. Leg Avenue is one of the companies that makes them, but the weave of their crotchless pantyhose looks very different from conventional pantyhose.     Frederick's of Hollywood and Dugan Brothers both sell crotchless pantyhose.     If your skirt is long enough, you can try the pantyhose that looks like a garter-belt with pantyhose combined, but beware. This can be risky. A lot of pantyhose loving guys are very anti-stockings. Your boyfriend might prefer conventional pantyhose.    If you are going to cut them yourself, buy pantyhose with a strongly reinforced cotton crotch panel (L'eggs Sheer Energy is a good bet). Fold the crotch in half like you would to cut paper dolls. Carefully cut a little hole in the center. Gradually cut the hole a little bigger, being careful to keep the oval reinforced webbing that separates the cotton panel from the panty intact. Keeping the strong outline of the crotch intact may help the pantyhose last longer.    With any of these routes, you might want to wear panties over the pantyhose, and then pull them down, or have your boyfriend pull them down, or push them aside, when the special moment arrives. You can also wear pantyhose under dress slacks or even jeans and surprise your boyfriend, who will probably be expecting socks, trouser socks, or knee hi's. "Accidently" let the trouser leg go above your knee. Your boyfriend will look for the waist band of the knee hi, but it won't be there and...OH BOY!    For a very special occasions, you can splurge and buy Fogal or Wolford pantyhose (VERY EXPENSIVE) which are TOTALLY seamless. No seam, no crotch panel, just sexy pantyhose which are very stretchy...you might not have to remove them or cut them...when the special moment arrives.    I am very excited for both of you! We pantyhose loving men salute you and the other wonderful women like you. Pantyhose blessings to you and your boyfriend. ENJOY! I just KNOW that you will! ; )|`|YTasscmKaa	From a guy who likes pantyhose, No Nonsense makes some nice pantyhose and you can get them at any drugstore.|`|eAhz7Hptaa	Your boyfriend is right, pantyhose are very sexy, and they look great too. What to wear is a matter of personal preference and you'll have to experiment and try different kinds to find what you both like. I like them sheer to waist, transparent and sheer and with a shine. I think they are the best looking, the sexiest and they also feel the best to wear.|`|AA10458195	I wear No Nonsense Panty Hose.  Your body size makes a difference  in what you should choose.  I am fairly small and so panty hose are  easy to get on.  A pal of mine hates wearing them because she is  large and has a struggle putting them on.  You can also get the thigh  highs. I think they are sexy . Expecially the black ones.|`|YvpG26Pmaa	I found that the best brand for its money is JC Penny's store brand. My exes legs look and felt good when they wore them. Also, they would cut the crotch out of them so they didn't have to take them off when we had sex.|`|zX80VRbmaa	The more shine the better.  If you want some shaping, then go for control top pantyhose.      http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...|`|BTpNkxoeaa	Well I am a crossdresser.  My personal favorite brand, whether it would be out in public or for a very intimate encounter with a girlfriend, is Wolford.  Yes they are expensive.  The basic styles start at $25-30 and go up from there (killer deals can be found on eBay though). But in my opinion they are hands down the best.  Well worth the money as they last much longer than other brands.  I've seen women who hated pantyhose with a passion do a total 180 after trying Wolfords.    As I cannot always afford Wolfords, especially if they're the causality of me and a girlfirend getting crazy behind closed doors, I have found other good brands.  Levee, Levante, Gerbe, Aristoc, Pretty Polly, Victorias Secret, Nordstrom (house brand), Donna Karan, and Spanx are also good brands.    Ways of knowing you have a good brand is that the hose fit well without sagging or bunching or being too tight and have a silky feel to them that feels good to the touch.    You ultimately have to experiment to find the right brand for you, because one that works well for some will not for others.  Regardless of brand, be sure to buy the right size and always properly launder them.|`|wXbH9cRXaa	You should wear Pantyhose on special occasions. It also depends on what type of clothing you are wearing.|`|ofJ8IBjfaa	Just about any pantyhose will do well in public.  If you want to give your boyfriend a thrill, take him pantyhose shopping with you.  Let him decide what he will be seeing on your legs.    For alone time, get garter stockings.  They always drive men wild.|`|ealVW30gaa	L'eggs Sheer Energy are a great value (only about $5), have the same silky feel as more expensive brands and will last more than one wearing.  Just be sure to read the sizing chart and get the right size.  Nothing worse than having pantyhose that are too small.    Sheer Energy are nice enough that you can wear them in both public and private.  If you are looking for something in a thigh high then I would go to Victoria's Secret as they have a nice selection there.|`|sVuUxt1Taa	Wolford Fatal's if you want something sheer and I'd go for the Wolford Satin 50 opaques if you want something a little thicker. If you want really opaque go for the Wolford natural fiber 80's, they feel amazing too.|`|bj4VKRefaa	Sheer Elegance

However, the most important thing is that you feel comfortable how you are, no matter what a tape measure says, because nobody's body is perfect =)    But, if it really bothers you, remember that nipped in waists make everything- boobs, shoulders, hips, bum- look loads bigger. Bold colours and embroidery and patterns around the neck/ on the top half of your body will make your shoulders look bigger too.    On a plus note, loads of supermodels have really broad shoulders, so smile!    xD|`|xsvDrtrRaa	you don't have to problem your shoulders, you should problem the clothes you wear...sometimes the clothes you wear makes your shoulder look more broad..
zC4cgGhqaa	The BEST mineral foundation is still the original - by SHEER COVER.  You can buy them in complete packs for light, medium or dark skin or - as this is very expensive - you can do what I do and buy the item you want without all the added extras on eBay.    One of the large 4g (90 day) posts lasts forever - much longer than 90 days.    I have seen people using Sheer Cover to cover birth marks, so it will certainly cover your acne.    I am very pale and I use the the shade "bisque" as "nude" is too dark for me.  Here is a great shade guide: http://www.sheercover.co.uk/help_selecti...  The main website is http://www.sheercover.com    Loads of make up companies have immitated Sheer Cover over the past year or so, but they are not 100% minerals and that's why you're finding they aren't doing the job and the colour is off.  Hope you can get some over in Australia - eBay will definitely help with that!|`|zY5ruug7aa	bare minerals in better than sheer cover!! i'm in australia too btw, i've tried both. if u got to youtube & watch videos u can see which one looks better (there are plenty of both).|`|AEmZaXg1aa	bare minereals|`|HsL0PYNGaa	Use the L'Oreal collection one.  there's penelope cruz advertizing for it.  it can be found in boots :)|`|cVeFGVNVaa	maybelline newyork if you have it lol its brilliant i brought it sat and wouldnt use anything else now. its also spf 15 good for the australian weather|`|t46TPqgWaa	Bare Minerals gives good coverage and you don't have to use much either.

Wear sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 30 under the eyes to prevent skin weakening caused by sun damage.     3. Get plenty of rest.     4. Apply plain cool teabags over closed eyes. Dont use herbal teabags, because most aren't as effective.     5. Apply cool cucumber slices over closed eyes for 15 minutes.     6. Be careful not to consume too much dietary salt. Start by learning about sources of sodium in the diet.     7. Apply vitamin K cream. Although studies haven't looked at the use of topical vitamin K for dark circles under the eyes, preliminary studies have found that vitamin K may help with bruising.     8. Vitamin C helps to strengthen blood vessel walls.     9. The dietary supplements grape seed extract and pycnogenol contain antioxidant pigments that may help to strengthen blood vessels. They should be used under medical supervision by people on "blood-thinning" drugs such as Coumadin (warfarin) and aspirin.     Certain foods, such as cranberries, blueberries, bilberries, tea (green and black), black currant, onions, legumes, and parsley also contain these antioxidant pigments.     10. Eat kidney-balancing foods. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, a bluish cast under the eyes are due to an imbalance in kidney energy.

Make sure that you have more amount of flour because its what makes it silky and have texture. Freeze it for a few minutes but if your orange juice is cold you dont really have too. Rub it on the edges of your circles for 10- 15 minutes. NOTE: This would not remove the whole thing it would just lighten and reduce it.      For a freshened set of eyes, take a wet wash cloth, and sprinkle rosmary and other aromic herbs on to it and roll it up, and pop it in the microwave for about a min. When you remove from the microwave lay roll onto eyes and lay down breathing deeply. remove the rag when it becaomes cold. follow up by blotting a tissue all over the eyes so that you are not wet there        Make a paste from a teaspoon of tomato juice, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, a pinch of turmeric powder and a pinch of gram flour. Apply under eyes for 10 minutes.        I suffer at a very young age with under eye circles (DARK), I completely hate them!!! I recently was foolinf around and tried a remedy, my grandmother had told me about. Put steaming hot unsweetened, noncaffienated, tea bags (the tea you drink on ice). Once as hot as you can stand it, place on problem areas, right up against lids. Press so that it is very warm, hold for 15-20 minutes!      Grate some cucumber and freeze in an ice tray. Massage frozen cucumber cubes onto eyes to reduce puffiness and dark circles.      Simple- you must increase your fibre consumption to at least 30grammes a day, and drink at least two litres of water, et voila, clear skin in a fortnight. Far more effective than silly epidermal applications. Perseverance needed though.       Apply cotton balls soaked in cucumber juice or potato juice around the eyes.      My mom takes vasoline, puts it on a metal spoon and freezes it for 15 minutes. Then she applies it to her eyes for a few minutes.     I have yet to try it but it might help someone else if it helps her. Let me know if you try it. :)        Take two thin slices of cucumber on place on your eyelids for 10-15 minutes. This helps cool your eyes and pretty much lighten your dark circles.   Good Luck!      In order to reduce dark circles under your eyes, i found that putting a warm teabag on them helps a bit. I just use the teabag right after making a cup of tea so its still warm.     Put it UNDER YOUR EYE. or if you're weird try putting it in your eye!|`|9R0jemnkaa	1. Have a nice sleep.  2.

vZ4NXlBmaa	http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...  The Search Bar works    and yes, a professional artist can tattoo over a scar that has completely healed|`|IwaTzQqxaa	you can get a tattoo over a scar.. the only issue that i have ever come across is that the ink may not take well by the scar.. a friend of mine had a huge scar on his arm and went for a half sleeve.. and it took 3 different sessions to get any color to stick on where the scar was     but i have gotten tattoos over scars and mine stuck just fine.. so it depends on the scar itself and the persons skin|`|fwfT8t4Yaa	Yes, yes you can!    I've had this done, my tattooist, who knows why i have the scar (skin cancer) did lots of research before she would tattoo me and i also asked my doctor.    Both of us came to the conclusion that tattooing over it would have no adverse health related effects and that the colour wouldn't bleed or spread.    It's going to hurt. i can tell you that!    Some artists won't tattoo scars, some won't tattoo faces or feet, thats a preference thing. Choose your artist wisely if you don't have a regular person you go to. Make sure their studio is clean and you should feel comfortable both chilling in the waiting room and asking to see where they clean their equipment.    :)   hope this helps!|`|KvZutMEZaa	I found out some info for you:    A scar needs at least a year to heal before it can handle a tat. Some artists wont take you on unless your scar is two years old; others wont tattoo a scar at all since the ink doesnt always hold or distribute properly. Hey, its their reputation at stake.     If you have a keloid scar that is raised significantly above the surface it can be difficult to tattoo and very sensitive. Theres also a risk that tattooing will contribute to keloid formation. Talk to your doctor.     The design should be busy or run through the scar so the texture of the scar isnt accentuated. For my hip Im thinking pixilated buttercups to celebrate my childhood, or colorful mosaic stars as a reminder to dream, or maybe a globe to keep me humble, conscious, adventurous.|`|WsFH6rUiaa	Yes u can it hurts and is a long proces. Most shops don't do it for fear that there will be big voids and the ink dosnt tend to stay. It 11 years old so it done and heald to a full scare best thing to do is call the shops and find a artist who has been doing it for a good time and find out if a artist has done it before. Just last week I tattooed a lady who had a c section done like 5 years ago she had me do an x with a dotted line and had her sons name done just above the scrare (x............) kind like that when I tattooed my scare on my leg it hurt like hell and it 17 years old so just do the leg work call ur shops and find out there might be a extra cost for this type of work for the fact its a hard to do tat. Hope this helps|`|k6D1HmtRaa	I guess u had a keloid scar which was red and elevated in the begining. If it is so then I would suggest u not to go for tattoing as it can make it broader than what it was. Even I have the same and my doctor has forbidden me. U can use makeup to hide it.
xnBnbYBgaa	i agree with everyone else that you shouldnt do it. however, none of them actually answered your question and shouldnt have put their opinions on here cuz this isnt yahoo opinions. ok, now, there are 3 ways that ive done a tattoo with and it works. number one you need to go to a place that sells inks (stationary store) and buy indian ink. ask for that specifically. now you can use a razor blade, needle, or ijn worst case scenario, a saftey pin. cut the image (not deep but until you bleed) and put the ink into it. wipe the extra ink off and put patroleum jelly on it and keep it bandaged. and dont be stupid, boil all tools and keep them in alcohol!|`|2aab9990f44abc785cfb7c119b182bdeaa	use a permanent marker and make a great tattoo|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	a tattoo gun, ink, tattoo needles...and talent...|`|OjIz85U3aa	a tattoo kit with needle and ink, just go and get one done professionally|`|UT9UfrRcaa	dont do it yourself get a pro to do it since it will be on you for ever   is even more of a bad idea if your a chick  a good tattoo is hot a bad tattoo is filthy|`|T7AmRfZQaa	Just dont even bother tryin ur obviously underage n u would regret it soo much its an awful thing to even think of doin i know people that done their own n they have all had to have them covered which means they were loads bigger than they ever imagined!!   Dont make that mistake!|`|fwfT8t4Yaa	Just don't.  I have lots of tattoos and i don't want you to rush out and get inked with something you'll hate (and that would have faded because you wouldn't have used professional grade ink and you wouldn't have gone deep enough for it to hold) in 2 years time in a very visible place. not to mention the health risks involved with kitchen table tattooing, Hepatitis being my main concern. and since i mentioned not going deep enough for safeties sake i should mention the consequences of going too deep into ones own wrist and bleeding out.     please don't do this.|`|rtx0YQDJaa	you really shouldn't be tattooing yourself... putting aside the fact that it's impossible to tattoo your own wrist seeing as you need two hands to do a tattoo properly. if you don't know anything about sterilization, cross contamination or proper tattooing techniques you will most likely end up scarring yourself or getting an infection, not to mention an ugly tattoo. in the end you would just end up paying to get it fixed so you may as well just do it properly and go to a reputable tattoo shop.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	This is funny...It will be much cheaper and less painful for you to just go to a shop and have it done correctly. Of course you will have to wait until you are old enough.    Or you can go steel a few candy bars, spend the weekend in jail, and get one done there. Some of the work there is pretty good or at least better than what you would be able to do. Knowing how to draw does not mean you know how to do a tattoo. You can really hurt your self and others.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	go to prison and they will teach you|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	a bic pen  then you can be destined for jail;|`|IllWKAUGaa	You take a needle and scratch yourself and then bleed some non-toxic ink into it....and then it will heal with the color in it. my friends did it all the time when we were in middle school...but that can be really dangerous and get infected and you can hurt yourself. unless you have a tattoo gun or proper tattoo equipment and experience then you shouldn't tattoo yourself or anyone else...you should get it done professionally, it will look good and be a lot safer that way.

ZL92cpPJaa	I think it is fairly hypocritical. If you don't want to have 1,000 eyes staring at you, don't use cleavage as an accessory because cleavage is one of the few things men will look at a woman for (trust me, I am one).|`|gQtbwpyCaa	because the ones tht do complain just want attention its annoyin i knew a girl who did tht and it was cause she had a really nasty personality and she wasn't pretty so she loveddd gettin attention and dressed like a s.l.u.t but people just looked at her in the rong way|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	From a man's point of view, unfortunately, yes, this is true.    The feminist movement burns into some womens' heads the idea that they are not "objects." (Study a little about feminism...objectivism is a big part of it). And most reasonable men would agree with this in modern times. Not just women...humans are not objects in that sense.    But the attraction to men of women is subjective...a woman's beauty...and part of that attraction is sexual in nature. This is something that cannot be helped or controlled without the artificial suppression of desires and thoughts. And I would make an educated guess that women feel the same way about attractive men. The difference is that men don't have an issue with it, most of the time.    So, if a women dresses "seductively" (and that can vary from culture to culture), men are going to notice and be attracted to what they see. If a woman dresses in such a way that, for example, she exposes (and enhances) her cleavage, *men are going to look*. There's an old bit on Seinfeld about this...if men see cleavage, we HAVE to look.    Seriously, however, if a woman dresses in a way that literally points to those features (especially in a professional, business or formal environment), I fail to understand how they can complain about the stares they get.    But, that's political correctness for you.    By the way, I don't think "most" women act this way.|`|KNwGCRBcaa	mayb because they r single or somthin idk|`|7dijqYLyaa	idk i wear provocative clothing and i don't complain....|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	No, not hypocritical. Artists seek to create a beautiful painting, that doesnt mean they want everyone at the museum touching it. Same with a lady, they seek to be alluring - but admire from a distance.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	Yes.    If you don't want us to stare, then don't advertise.|`|OBRW9JZhaa	Idk where you live but where I live noone dresses provocatively because it's too cold. But in my opinion society expects women to constantly perform personal maintenance that takes significantly longer than what men are expected to do so they probably want to show their hard work off.     On a side note I personally think that anyone would get sick of being stared at even if the person being stare at was wearing a giant neon sign that said "stare at me"

Always dress for an interview--it is expected.  That doesn't mean you can not wear flats--but something with a small heel is usually more flattering to your line.      I'd wear boots and take a pair of shoes in my bag--you can always change when you get there--or upon assessment of what others are wearing... simple matter to step into the ladies room upon arrival and change your footwear.

You don't want to be tottering around in that situation.|`|mxtWuadraa	I think you should give the heels a miss.. the snow is just awful and you don't want to be turning up with a twisted ankle.. or worse, not turning up cos you're in hospital with a broken leg.. lol worse case scenario!!!     why don't you wear some smart dolly shoes? they're relatively practical, but smart at the same time! everyone wins!! loll     good luck with the interview and i hope it goes well!! =D|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	Don't wear heels that are too high you wobble - and if you want to wear them for the interview, change into them when you get there.  Wear sensible shoes or trainers to the interview, and change in the reception room.  I expect half the office employees will be doing that anyway.    By the way, the point of an interview is to stand out from the rest - don't think you have to blend in!|`|AA11567932	Silly idea wearing heels- yes. I would say perhaps trousers with some smart/casual black boots, with plenty of grip..    the last thing you want is to fall over on ya bottom!!|`|DoO04zsqaa	hmm.. it's best to wear a pair of flat cute pumps, as you never know how the weather will be by tomorrow. you may slip on the snow, then you never know if you'll be okay enough to walk to interview..

Anything going down your spine, you need to make sure you have an exceptionally high pain tolerance before you attempt it.    If you're so close to your date of getting a tattoo, but you're looking for an opinion, chances are you aren't ready for a tattoo just yet.|`|9K8CRZyOaa	In my opinion getting something as permanent as a tattoo should decided and thought about for more than a week and should mean something to you instead of strangers on the internet who might cause you regret later.    But if you're looking for other peoples opinions on what you should get, unless you are in fact chinese I think that that those symbols as tattoos are really cliche and i think that maybe you should spend a bit more time looking at things that would stand out more than a butterfly and the symbols.    At this website you can find tattoo's that hundreds of people have gotten and it's really interesting.  you should check it out if you haven't already.  http://www.bmezine.com/

Also, pink lillies symbolize prosperity, which is what anybody would wish for.    The one on my left wrist is a bunch of purpleish blue forget me nots.

QKWUSfq3aa	O.K. I saw this too and really wanted to try it, but didn't want to waste $15.00 in case it didn't work. So, I assumed it was like a sandpaper type product and from what I've read on the internet, it is. I had my husband go to the auto parts store and pick me up some really fine grit sandpaper like they use on cars! Weird, I know! But it only cost $4.00. I used 320 grit sandpaper on a spot on my arm going in a circular motion and not pressing too hard. It totally took the hair off, but left my skin a little red & irritated. Then I used it on my leg, I have very coarse leg hair it totally worked on my leg and didn't leave it red. It left my leg really smooth! Just make sure afterwards you use a good moisturizer because it does exfoliate the skin also. Hope this helps, but please don't sand your skin off!!!!|`|2ZtKyUoLaa	yeah i bought it     it works wonders  i use it on my arms     no hairy arms anymore! ahah   you just have to apply a lotion after|`|W4sNRgs3aa	it looks like BS to me  Nair doesn't even work that well  I wouldn't waste my money    your should either wax or shave|`|Cp6wh6yYaa	i want to try it too i saw it at walgreens....i'll tell you when i buy it :)|`|9eb4f9ecc23dbc08ff09badb95268b49aa	NOOO!!! i bought it, it doesn't work. it makes your skin feel smooth but the hair is still there
SFiP3pckaa	These are cheap and good quality cleansers that I've tried:  I used St. Ives Apricot Scrub and it made my skin a lot smoother looking and even. They make one for sensitive skin too. If you want to use this scrub, also get a normal cleanser(not a scrub) to go with it. You shouldn't use a scrub more than twice a week, because too much exfoliation isn't good for your skin. So, you can look at St. Ives' products...  You could also try Clean and Clear Morning Burst(yeah, I know it says morning but use it whenever, it's a good product), it makes your skin feel really refreshed and smooth. Clean and Clear also makes some great moisturizers too.     So, these are my favorite cheaper products. They work well and smell good too. lol. :)  I hope I helped!|`|VihV4Troaa	i like estee lauder "ideal" but it's a good $115...    i recommend burt's bees products. they are almost all natural.  do not get clean and clear moisturizer in the purple bottle. it burns sensitive skin.|`|7xdEb0XAaa	Clean and Clear works I PROMISE you.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	Good products for sensitive skin would be Cetaphil, Purpose, and Neutrogena (be careful with WHAT you get from them... their gel cleansers are harsh for my skin, but their cream cleansers are amazing)    For the daytime, get at least an SPF 25 moisturizer. For night, get a moisturizer that balances your skin (controls oil, but moisturizes the dry spots)|`|s095tIYeaa	checks and balances from Origins. $18  made especially for combination skin.    moisterizers that i use are Clinique--- Dramatic Difference Lotion $24  and Origins--- Night a Mins. $36|`|pmWj14ADaa	i to have sensitive skin an i was recommended by a docton to use cetaphil fash wash which can be from 8-13$  then to mouisturize use eucerin wit sp15 or just plain eucerin which goes for 5-10$ depending on bottle size. hope this helps    _&*AKiRAyO|`|PCa8jwMuaa	Cetaphil products are well priced and are less than half the cost of high range brand names like Elizabeth Arden. They have a range for different types of skin, paticularly sensitive skin (like mine), which you can purchase at chemist/drugstores and online.

I love them. I had to take them out for surgery, they were out for about a week, and I felt naked the whole time. Mine are currently 8 gauge. You may not want to go that big, but don't get them done any smaller than 12 gauge. They will heal better and be more stable.     As for the pain, it hurts, but it's not unbearable and it's over in a second. They will be tender for about 2 weeks, and you will notice you bump your chest a lot.     Long story short, go for it. I'm sure you'll love them. Totally worth the pain!|`|c5anDswjaa	I have mine done.. Yes they hurt like a mofo, but it wasnt anything I couldnt handle, I didnt yell or cry lol..

Youll love them afterwards!     -Millions of people think nipple rings are hot, my nipples arent saggy (what a dumb thing to say), and if having nipple piercings makes me a freak then Im a freak!

3dzuYTC5aa	Laser is permanent but it takes about 6 sessions until its permanent, each time u go back it will be lighter and lighter till its gone. They usually sell packages rather than just one session so its more reasonable.     Wazing is great for the face, I do it on my eyebrows.... if you need that or above the lip or chin area its all very effective. I prefer the Nads, its a sugar and honey vs. wax...... lots of people have wax alergies and honestly sugaring is more effective.   Also I buy cucumber masks.... you wear them for about an hour until they dry then you usually peel them off but I tent to rip mine off real fast..... gets some of those small blonde hairs that are around the hair line, ear area, cheeks and such.... just for a smoother look.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Waxing is very effective. Electrolysis is permanent.|`|DsLx6Sixaa	Laser is effective, but I can tell by your avitar that it may not work for you. Laser usually does not work for blond women. Laser works best for dark haired, light skinned women.    If you are blond you will likely need electrolysis. That is permanent, but it takes alot of treatments. Each hair needs to get individually zapped. So, each session, will only cover a few hairs.    There are some home hair removal systems you can try. Although not everyone is delighted by them, they are less expensive and much more convenient than going to a pro. Might be worth a try.|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	Depilatory.|`|o4qwJ1o7aa	how about bleaching?  way cheaper  way easier!

Looking at you may be a sign he wants to get your attention, or is checking to see if he is, this shows he wants you to notice him, or maybe he wants you to know he's noticing you.    The fact you both have similar tastes in music and style shows you both have something in common.    Calling you sexy and grabbing your *** shows he's physically attracted to you.     The fact he asked for your number shows he wants to be able to contact you more, which means he is interested in getting to know you more.

Another option which you might hate lol, is to warm olive oil in your hair and then sleep with it in overnight or wash it out an hour or two later with shampoo and a nice rich conditioner =D    Leave in conditioner, gloss, all that can be put in afterwards oh heehee try washing it every 3 days =P|`|HIO0yvK0aa	ok, first of all go to hairdressers, get ends cut.    and basically what happens when you wash it you remove some of the natural oils in your hair. giving it that dry texture, everyone hates that feelins, personally i wash my hair everyday, but weirdly it's rarely dry. i guess the best options would be getting the torn ends cut. and that should stop it|`|HKNbWjtOaa	wet look gel and if it starts too smell a bit of shake & vac should do the trick!|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Wet it.|`|XgZZlExPaa	Okai Im Studying Hair Dressing And Trust Me My Hairs Dry Sometimes To, But What I Do Is Deep Condition Treatment My Hair At Least Once A Weak, You Leave It On For About 15 Mins Simple, And When The Hairs Wet, Its Better To Comb It Rather Then Brush It Becuase Brushing Causes More Split Ends And Damage, Blow Dry The Hair Downwards From Root To Tip Using A Flat Brush Or A Round Brush This Will Make It Look Smoother, Use Heat Protection Products But Too Much Product Makes Ur Hair Greasy So Spray At Bit In Your Hands And Run It Threw Your Hair, And Dont Forget To Follow The Intructions On The Bottle, Id Advise You Get The Split Ends Cut Out Regulary, And Maybe When You Wash It Massage The Shampoo Harder Onto The Scalp As It Will Encorage The Natural Oils And Aslong As You Dont Continue To Abuse It With Heat And Loads Of Products, Your Hair Will Be Looking Great Again Soon, Trust Me Ino It Works Because I Do It Myself|`|R3DY16Biaa	I have the same problem "/  Get your hair trimmed every 2 months to get rid of split ends.  And if your hair is dry from over-styling eg. using hair dryers, straighteners, curling tongs on it, then try laying off them for a while or at least cutting down on the amount you use them.  Deep conditioner and hair masques are really good to help restore shine and make hair look and feel healthy again. Use instead of normal conditioner and instead of just applying it to the roots of your hair, slather it all over, making sure that you rub it in. Really coat your hair in it and leave it for 5-10 minutes.  For the whole 'washing everyday thing', don't do it. It really isn't good for it, it strips all the natural oils away from your scalp which is probably a reason for your dry hair. If you don't like unclean hair, dry dry shampoo, like Batiste, it's really cheap and there's a tropical version which smells amazing, (since you said you hate it when your hair smells bad). Or just tie it up in a pony tail or something so it doesn't feel as bad.  x|`|Twq7efhQaa	this is a really good site and will help you with your problem.     http://www.salonweb.com/moretips.htm|`|vYt8KQRMaa	ok well you need a haircut get those split ends cut off. and stop washing you hair everyday. thats why its dry. your hair has oils in it that make it soft when you wash it everyday your is dry when you dont wash it for awhile it gets greasy|`|nUXTR8VKaa	firstly go to a hairdresses and get your split ends sorted  then DO NOTT WASH YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY it is soo bad for your hair  and dont brush it lots either,  firstly: use LOADS of conditiner and leave it for like 15 mins  secoundly - smelly hair   get this spray called batiste which is dry shampoo and so you just spray it on your hair, and it gets rid of greasy hair, and makes it smell soo good too , i use the tropical one :) hope this helps x|`|EAr4oja6aa	You need to get your split ends cut off for a start, then you should either buy a deep conditioner or make a homemade mask of olive oil, banana and yogurt and leave it on for at least 5 minutes, repeat this every 3rd day for 2 weeks.

Make sure to soak it for 5-10 minutes, and don't use table salt, it can just irritate the piercing more. Sea salt can be bought at any regular grocery store. The salt should help with the swelling and help your piercing heal well.

Whereas "Oil slick" is glittery but not overly so. Check to make sure the finish is Matte, Velvet, etc.     I really love Urban Decay. They have nice colors and good pigmentation. However, I am a MAC girl at heart. They still have the best shadows and what not.     Except, you can't beat the Urban Decay Primer Potion, it's just amazing.    I hope that helps!

Follow your artists aftercare instructions and wash frequently (don't soak it for any reason).

I use proavtive, it pretty much works for any skin type and if you do think about using it, the refining mask works great, it is a small bottle that can be ordered with the package and you dab it on at night  on your pimples after you used the proactive kit, it'll clear it up by morning, if not cleared up, then its barely visible :) don't wash your face too much if you don't like the proactive idea, use moisturizer and only clean your face 1-2 a day :) also, change your towels every week so when you dry your face, it'll be cleaner~|`|sPDQIxJTaa	WASHING YOU FACE: use warm water to open up your pores. then cleanse with a gentle acne cleanser or even plain soap. rinse off with warm water. rinse face with cold water to close pores. do this every morning and night. if you wash your face too many times a day it could end up irritating your skin even more.    MOISTURIZE: after you wash your face in the morning moisturize with a light moisturizer for whatever your skin type is; oily, combo, dry.    MAKEUP: only use makeup when you need to since it can cause more acne if you use it constantly. if you use liquid then get one that says it doesn't clog pores and just dab it on the pimple you want to cover up. if you use concealer, do the same thing. in my opinion powder is the best for acne-prone skin, since it is least likely to clog pores and it is light, allowing your skin to breathe easier.    ACNE CREAMS AND SUCH: at night use an acne cream or treatment, pill or whatever works best for you. my advice is to go to your doctor and have them refer you to a dermatologist. if you have health insurance it wont be very pricey at all. just ask your parents to take you to the doctors. anyways, use your acne treatment at night since that is when your skin recovers.    MASK: use a face mask 1-2 times a week.    EXFOLIATE: exfoliate your skin 2 times a week to get rid of dead skin cells.    IS A PIMPLE REALLY BUGGING YOU: dab a dot of plain toothpaste on the pimple and leave it on overnight. make sure to only put it on the pimple not rub it all over your skin since it will dry it out. by morning it should be gone.    WATER: i used to think that drinking lots of water wouldn't be really good for your skin but i was proven wrong. drink about 6-8 glasses a day or just drink water with most meals and your skin will smothen out and you will notice fewer pimples.    EATING RIGHT: if you notice that certain foods make you breakout more then stay away from those. also try to eat healthy, getting all your fruits and veggies.    EXERCISE: keeping your body healthy is important also. just make sure when you workout that you don't wear makeup while doing it. and wear loose fitting clothes since sweating against tight clothing can cause body acne.

Half? 3/4?
Su0O55W8aa	umm maybe Doutzen Kroes but i'm not positive    http://www.fanpop.com/external/2974074
U1xvObr4aa	I've seen some beautiful tats of the sugar candy skulls. You can pretty much pick any design and color and go crazy!!! They are beautiful and if it means a lot to you, then it would be an amazing tattoo.|`|oM7bXmkvaa	No I wouldnt personally I have 6 working on 8 already though..    Mine are..    "Shattered en Pedazos"(on my shoulder blade) I got it after loosing a loved one. It means "shattered to peices"    "Misfortune" I feel I have this (Right below my stomach area on the left side, my left looking down)    A black heart (on my left foot) saying inside of it "corazon"(meaning heart).     "Elusive"(on my left ankle) Means hard to describe which I feel I am.    and Im working on getting "El Corazon Le Rompio Shattered" If I can find a good place for it (meaning "the heart you shattered") Another loved one, this time a boyfriend. We didnt break up, he passed away..    I would like to get "Kato" and "Koto" with paw prints on me eventually too. I dont know where... Those were the names of my first dogs.  Kato means good "judgement" in Japanese.  Koto means "harp music" in Japanese.    Im not inot that kind of thing I guess|`|067in9BMaa	I found a couple that are pretty cool.  http://www.avatarsdb.com/avatars/day_of_...  http://www.avatarsdb.com/avatars/day_of_...    No matter what you get it's going to be a pretty kickass tatoo!
