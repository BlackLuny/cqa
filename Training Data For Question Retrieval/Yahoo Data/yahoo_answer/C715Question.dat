20070530135333AAAngag	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do they think that something is wrong with me because I am enjoying my single life??	Many of my female friends are single mothers dealing with dead beat fathers.  They stay in relationships with men that they complain about being no good simply so they won't be alone.  I have never understood this way of thinking.     I am 31 years old, single with no kids and I love it.  I don't have to deal with dead beat fathers, or the other drama that comes along with that.  If a guy approaches me I can pretty much tell what he is about as soon as he opens his mouth, and I am quick to dismiss loosers.   My friends think that something is wrong with me.  They constantly tell me that I am not getting any younger and that I need a man now so that I can hurry up and start a family.  They say that  a no good man is better than no man at all.  I think this kind of thinking is outrageous and shows their lack of self esteem.  Does anyone else agree with me or them??
20070328095058AAueSMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Low self esteem problems and dating!?	A friend of mine has issues with low self esteem.  She is pregnant from a guy who she says isn't even her boyfriend.  She already has one 6 year old.     She constantly calls me up complaining about him and about all the things that he does and doesn't do for her.  I asked her why in the world do you stay with someone who doesn't make you happy?  She says that it is better to be with someone than to be alone.  What kind of madness is this?  Why would anyone want to be miserable than be alone?  What is so wrong with being single and chilling on your own?   Anyway, I get kind of tired of hearing her complain because to me the whole situation is dumb.  She told me that she gets so sad and depressed that she sits in the dark and won't even go to work.     I don't want to be rude.  I see her situation for what it is and told her that she needs to start loving herself first before she can truly love anyone else.  Should I continue to listen to her problems or what?  Help please what to do?

My boyfriend as well as all my other friends say I should just leave.       Is that such a good idea?    I'm aware of the Becca Bill, but I could stay with someone. I'm just scared of hurting her.
20070418203354AAVlcBC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me or just being nice?	Well there was this one time when I was studying he came over and asked what i was doing I was also very stressed for this big test, and I told him and he said don't worry about it he also came back later to ask how it was going but I had my headphones on. He also stood there forever after that.      -Before I went to the star thing I had choir practice, and before we left he came over with his friend, to ask us where it was going to be at. My friend and I didn’t know either so we called my friend who knew about it. The weird thing was was that his brother was already there, who he came with, at the star thing. When I came with my friends I saw him there and so when we came we sat down we were going to sit on the floor but we moved to the chairs he did the same and sat right behind me and there were a lot of other chairs open. During it he would make fun of the pictures and what not. At the end I chucked my scarf at him and he kept pulling on it and wouldn't let me have it back. We went outside to look at telescopes. One of the kids had problems with his so I went over the kid I like went over to look at it he couldn't see so i pulled out my cell phone for the light and I saw him smiling. When we went over to look at the big telescope he and his little brother were running around me I guess playing not sure, but the kid next to me “guys stop being flirts” so yeah…      -On New Years eve I went to a Black tie party, I went out side after dancing and when I tried to get back in it was locked I then called my best friend to chat and to keep my mind off of being out in the dark (I hate the dark) so I called and asked if she could help me to call my friends or something. And well he was at her house. I asked if should could like come over and rescue me and what not and then he got on the phone and said he would come and save me. This was a minor story, but I felt like sharing. ^.^         -Ok so during school I had to do a play, it was really for the older class but they needed more people so I had to even though I didn’t want to. After my part was done I didn’t have to go back up. (Thank god!!) He was talking to much with his friend so he got moved. I thought he was farther from my chair, but he was right in front of it. So during the play he would keep turning around to comment on the play. I had a meeting with my teacher to sing some song for something, after that I when back to get my jacket and he came by to ask me what he said who knows why because he came in not to long into the convo. So that was one of the moments.      -While at my graduation he gave a speech and while he was up there I could feel someone stare at me and when I looked at him he was staring at me even almost during the entire time he spoke to. That was a little on, but hey I told you anyway

20070422115821AA69yTR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just answered this question which made me wonder...?	Why do men feel the need or have to be really nasty? Is it their self-defence that kicks in as in a form of a lion?    I've experienced such with both bf's and friends (not always pointed at me), if they got angry or annoyed they would be the worst bastards - languagewise..   Is it because they feel helpless? Or is it herhaps just in their nature? How can one make them change this primitive side of them? cause it's really destroying..

He has been calling me and said sorry but also said what he did was right! What's the point of saying sorry and defending yourself?? Then he e-mailed me saying that he shouldn't be treated like this and he deserves a better person and what kind of girl would stay without talking to him and blah blah then said sorry i give up! What should i do at this point! I know he says like this to make me talk to him! But i really want him to understand his mistakes this time and not to do in the future!

20070523133317AA8GyTt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused: I love her but always wonder what if...?	I've been going out with this girl for like 8 months now, the first "real" relationship I've had (some flings and one nighters don't count, etc), and even though we love each other - I really do like her - I sometimes think that there is someone better suited for me. I'm 23, she's 20, and even though we are very similar (both into same things, both introverted, etc), I wonder about other women I pass by daily - I am very confident but shy so I always think that I can get other attractive women if I tried.      Part of me that wonders about this relationship stems from me even thinking about this. Is it natural? (I feel like its a problem if you start wondering) I don't want to lose what I have but at the same time I always have the mindset of "exploring your options" so I always ask myself if I intend on keeping the first woman I've really cared about? Any advice is appreciated

At 1st I was pretty crazy bout this kid but after a date with his friends along, that he didn't pay for, I felt uber turned off. But when he called l8r, I didnt have the courage to end it. And the more we talked, the more I liked him again & figured wed have a better time if his friends werent around. I confronted him about not paying and he said he meant 2. We cont'd to have good conversations that made me think "thank god i didnt end it with him before!" At some point we fell into this extremely long game of phone tag. The longest we've been able to talk is a few minutes. Hes started to say "I'll call you at such and such time" & then not do it. & I havent had a chance to confront him about it! I feel like I'm starting to forget why I liked him in the first place, I havent seen him in like a month & it feels like the same w/ talkwise. I'm tired of his excuses and all of a sudden i feel like maybe i shuld just end it now...

Also, he always wants to talk about me a lot, instead of him. And he's always interested in how things are going with my boyfreinds and stuff. Also he always has these cryptic messages in his name saying stuff like: I love you, i'll always be there for you, even if you don't know it, and: if only you knew how much i loved you.

20070603214358AAacbCP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like a guy. He has a girlfriend. She is perfect...!!?? HELP?	i like a guy who has a girlfriend. when he's with her, they seem so distant and strange. i dunno maybe its just because we're in class or something, but I have never flirted with this guy and don't plan to because he is obviously dating someone...but he always talks to me or asks me questions that are obvious like "what is our chemistry homework" or "did you think the test was hard.."      i guess im being stupid and immature, because those questions are typical, but still. i really like him, but can do nothing about it. his girlfriend is so perfect.       she's pretty and popular and has more confidence than the average walnut, which is more than most can say. although she seems unitelligent (saying "like" as every other word), she is actually inredibly smart, taking the same Honors and APs as me and him...      they never talk to eachother when i see them, or they act awkward.       what do i do? i like a guy who im pretty sure doesn't like me. im nothing compared to her perfection! advice?!

I have been living in US for almost 6 yrs now. I have a quick question about dating. I met an Italian gentleman (who's American since he was born & raised here) in a business setting yesterday. My boss took me along for the meeting. I did not even have my business card to give to him but he gave me his. He just generally asked over lunch a lil bit about my work, what brought me to US and general stuff. I have never even had a coffee date with anybody outside of Indian culture. We just got talking & he told me about himself. Seems he's divorced too with a16 yr old daughter. He's very handsome and very intelligent. I read up on him on linked in & seems like he must be 45, 46 yrs old. I asked my frens & they said Americans are typically looking for sex quickly. I should forget the episode and specially since this is a professional contact but I feel like meeting him once. They said that will be acting weird plus I will not see him again.

I'm in university at the moment and as most of you will know its not just people of the same age mixing, so the group of mates that i do have are a wide age range. theres one guy whos 28, ive only ever really thought of him as a friend before and as i thought he felt the same about me, i've always felt really comfortable around him, i'm 20. we get on really well and a few of our mutual friends always say we would make a great couple. Recently we've been IM each other and texting, and in one of the IM he revealed he was interseted in me, i thought about it and we arranged to meet up, but on the day he text me sayin he wasnt going to meet up because i was leading him on, i totally wasnt, so the next day he apologised and said listen we may like each other alot but if we got together it might ruin our friendship, and make university difficult. He's now hardly speaking to me and I feel so confused. Any advice?
20070531094305AAHBMuY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do most girls assume all guys are complete sex addicts?	I don't believe in having sex until after you're married, yet many people don't want to get too close to me because they believe in that stereotype.       What I would like to ask is:       1. Do you keep from getting close to somebody because you think they would go too far with you?    2. What do you want a guy to be like? (I try to be romantic, and I find all girls beautiful, as long as they think of themselves as beautiful.)   3. Do you feel that a kiss seals a relationship? If so...why?

20070703045230AA3wC2g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are there any Generic/Default attributes that all women are attracted to?	I don't think im a good looking guy, probably rate myself as a 5/10, plus during my collage years my friends called me a nerd coz i was one of the top student in my class, always on my PC either studing or playin' games...bla..bla..bla.. i hope you get the picture..      but the thing that supprises me the most  is that, well, even though i was not working at gettin' the girls to like me; by wearing fancy clothes, smooth vibes and all that sh*t, i was still kind of attrackting women towards me, or atleast i thought i was....(or maybe i mistook it for friendship). So, this leads to my questions;      1. How do you know if a girl likes you? Do girls have like some common behaviour?      2. Are there any generic attributes that most ladies find attractive?..      coz honestly, i can't call my self a smooth talker, most of the time i have this serious face. But some how i kinda have ladies tryin' to flirt with me(most recently there was this woman aged 25-27)..      Girls!!!! i need help!!

Well i meet a girl at a party and only got to see her for three days then i had to go work for the army 230 miles away but will be coming back in mid-august to get ready for school again. Me and her have been talking everynite and have gotten to know each other alot better and we are starting to fall for each other. Yesterday she texts me and said that she misses me and cant wait to talk to me after work then like 2 hours later she text me back and said that she had done alot of thinking and she isnt sure what she wants... Then she said she thinks it would be better if she were single till she figures it out... Whats up with girls i mean could it be that her ex-bf or 3 years called her the nite before and wanted to talk? But she told me that she wants nothing to do with him at all because he turned into a slob... Any help on what i should do???

20060731201426AA8o8Ig	Family & Relationships;Family	?Se puede lograr que una mujer madure?	Mi hermana se casó por capricho con un holgazán bueno para nada. Primero huyó de la casa con él y 6 meses más tarde se casó (ella pagó la fiesta y su vestido). Después de un hijo se separaron (pues ella pagaba los gastos y él nada), luego se reconciliaron y se embarazó de nuevo y al nacer éste último se separaron de manera muy violenta. El llegó a insultarla en la calle y golpearla delante de los ni?os. Ahora lleva tres a?os viviendo en casa de mi mamá y no se responsabiliza de sus hijos, los deja al cuidado de se?oras o vecinas, pues trabaja casi todo el día. No aporta ningún dinero a la casa, no paga ni la cuenta del teléfono. No le prepara de comer ni de cenar a sus hijos. Para rematar está saliendo con un hombre casado que le pide dinero y llega a casa hasta la madrugada. No ordena su cuarto (también de los ni?os) ni limpia la casa. ?Qué puedo hacer con mi hermana, qué le digo? Mi mamá se esta volviendo loca con esta situación ?A caso no maduró mi hermana, necesita un psicólogo?

Por temporadas se pone muy distante, nunca me dice que me ama. A veces pasa mucho tiempo y no se me acerca. Yo solo le pido a Dios por el. En estos 11 a?os no he dejado de llorar ni un dia. Le pido a Dios por la felicidad de mi marido. Se me han acercado hombres y nunca he aceptado nada de ellos aunque no reciba amor ni cari?o de parte de mi pareja. Ahora mi pareja esta en otro pais. Le escribo que lo extra?o y que lo amo. El nunca me contesta nada al respecto. Es como si ni leyera mis mensajes. Yo aun le sigo siendo fiel y aun sigo pidiendole a Dios porque el sea feliz. Le pregunto si se quiere divorciar y dice que no. Yo creo que mas no puedo hacer. Que mas que ser fiel cuando no te dan ni amor ni sexo? Que mas que confiar en Dios por tantos a?os y llorar tanto en silencio...pero siento que me consumo. La vida es corta. Naci para amar, pero no ser correspondida. Soy muy respetuosa y como ven muy fiel.

20060928135822AA0JM5G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl at my work is acting differently; what do her actions mean?	So I've been working in the Electronics department at Wal-Mart for a couple months, and there's this one admittedly cute coworker of mine that works with me. She's a couple years older than me and she has a boyfriend who works in the Automotive department at the same store. She says that she loves him and wants to spend the rest of her life with him, but she's been acting really weird lately.      I've been really accident-prone lately; always hurting myself at work somehow. She just recently started showing some concern and worry about my physical state. She always asks me first if I want to help her with her tasks in the department. And she always wants to know which days and times I work. Plus, she's just started touching me occasionally, like my shoulder or my back. And she says I'm really funny.      I know that a relationship with a coworker would be unethical, so I'm not looking for that. I guess what I'm looking for is, is it incidental? Or does she mean something more?

20061013020931AAS8QqJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Mabel, Michael and Kevin?	In my previous question, someone told me Mabel more than Michael was to be blamed for what happened. But why? Micheal was the one that claimed to have heard from God. Mabel was a novice who just gave her life to Jesus (born-again) at the time and was willing to obey God with just anything. At every point of the way, Micheal kept reteirating how some other people other than himself also confirmed He had actually heard from God. Mabel is a quite person that keeps things to herself, hence the reason she did not seek any other person's opinion on this issue. Moreover, the bible passage that said 'God's ways are different from our own ways' kept coming into her mind. She therefore felt, God had a different plan for her other than the one she had always nursed concerning the issue of her marriage partner.
20061016032957AAdwDRv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Did he take advantage of me or was I just too, stupid, naive or deep into religion!?	I' m angry with my hubby. Long be4 we started our courtship, we're both friends & we used to share our fantasies with each other. E.g. there was a girl he used to tell me he was in luv with on his campus & I also used to tell him I would rather wait till I's through with schooling before starting a relationship and in fact, that's my greatest wish to God & my reason for keeping myself. I remember he once asked me my ideal man & I described the type of person I would like to marry, which is very different from his person. Despite this, I saw him writing a letter to propose marriage to me months later, backing it up with a vision, prophesy from God and biblical citations. I was carried away with all these and thought God must have indeed spoken to him since he used to tell me about a different girl he was eyeing all along. Am married to him now & finally, the scales've fallen off my eyes. I feel deceived into marriage. It becomes more painful becos I actually met someone I luv after schl

20090131103711AAbTQtI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	As i read these posts.  Its just sad?	As im reading through peoples posts so many people have taken the approach to run as soon as things get rocky and that love rush feeling seems to disapate.  This is exactly what my soon to be ex is doing also.  I find it very sad people think love should be like in the movies and a fairy tell forever.  Have you ever noticed that the love stories in the movies are typically NOT dealing with all the other life stresses but focused just on love.   I guess you its possible to focus only on love if you have enough money but i dont think its reality.  No You shouldnt leave your spouse cause your unhappy, Yes you should learn to discuss what is bothering each other, Yes you should try to forgive them, And most importantly you should look at them with understanding,  Understand why they do this and that.  The only thing i say not to try to work though is when the spouse is abusive or is cheating. THere is no excuse for that.        Who else things the whole idea of love and marriage is at x-roads and is not a sacred pact that is once was?

Im a hairdresser in a major salon who works really hard and has to travel into the city where i grew up for my job, my job is like my run away place. We both could never get enough of each other then he became very distant with me now i know why, he had a one night stand last month and i only found out about it. He tells me he is crazy about me as he tells me everyday and writes songs about me. Our sex life is amazing, but i stopped the sex for now.I cant look at him with out crying and thinking of how he hurt me.He still treats me like im the only thing that matters to him, but right now i couldnt care.I grew up in foster care and now i feel i have nothing..again. My best friends are in NY where im from and i go to them when i can just to get away from it all. I was thinking of a divorce but maybe i should think about all this a little more. I want to make him feel how hurt i am (i know it sounds stupid) how can i do this (nothing really bad)?Should i end it or just stay & see how it goes?
20090131101457AASuOpi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is an immature little kid ???? HELP PLEASE!?	He has been unemployed for over 6 months. We live with his parents. I'm currently 3 months pregnant. I was going to school full-time but just dropped half of my classes to look for a full-time job. He is NOT serious about finding a job. He plays video games all day long. I tell him that I don't want to live with his parents forever and that I have his kid coming, he needs to take everything seriously. He rather sit and live off his parents forever. He is 32 years old. I am 21 years old. I told him I don't want a kid as a husband. He barely looks for jobs, I send out all his resumes and types his cover letters while he plays game? I'm pregnant, I'm going to school, and I'm looking for a job also? He can't do it himself???      When he gets interviews, he dresses in jeans and a t-shirt. I tell him to wear nice pants and a nice shirt and he argues with me everytime? He says its not necessary? I don't know what to do anymore.      I'm so stressed and depressed. I feel like he doesn't want to grow up. I think he's been relying on his parents too much.       What do I do?? PLEASE HELP??? I need him to get a job. I am always constantly looking for a job and he's always playing game or doing things besides looking for a job! :(

20090131102506AA4G1yO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your husband told you?	That he had a pantyhose fetish. That he likes women wearing pantyhose, especially during sex. Also, that he has worn pantyhose before. I told my wife that four years ago. She would wear them for every once in awhile, but it seem to always cause a problem. She say that since I told her that I also like to wear them. Not in public, just every once in a while. She said that she hasn't felt the same way about me that she did before. That I'm not the man that she married. We are doing through a divorce now. And I'm afraid to tell my next girlfriend about it. How would you feel if your husband told you the same thing?

20090131100036AARY0Bu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is a DJ and I have issues with him going to promote his events at clubs.  Any words of wisdom?	He went pro two years ago and since then he has traveled and has worked to get his name out.  At times I feel as if he puts his career first.  I do go to his gigs sometimes, but mostly I stay home with my son.  He is a totally a people person outside of the house, but with us he's the opposite.. Mostly serious and sometimes even rude. Sometimes we fight and he says really mean things that are meant to hurt me...but just as fast as he lashes out his words, he will forget what he said or act as if nothing is wrong.  I try talking to him sometimes and he'll mock me or change the subject... I never feel we have closure.  I have dealt with years of his attitude and I feel manipulated at times. At this point I'm unsure of whether I'm overbearing or too jealous... or if indeed he is taking advantage of his job to do what he pleases.  I have gone to therapy, tried being passive, tried confronting him with my feelings, I have even tried being a bit rebellious and giving him a bit of his own medicine, going out with my girlfriends..tit for tat.  I guess I just need some wise words from anyone out there.  I do want to keep my family together.   I hear my son say he loves having his mommy and daddy... and yet my husband says to me neither my son or myself will tie him down (this he says when he is trying to say something "hurtful" during an argument.)   Anyway, sorry for the rant. My question is, Can anyone offer me some wise words or advice?

They had been dating really heavily because they found that they had a lot in common.  They had a date planned for Friday night.  He called and cancelled that afternoon stating that he had to go back to work due to an emergency.  My friend passed by his house as she didn't believe his story.  When she did this, to her surprise, he was at home.  When she called him to aks where he was he lied and said at work.  She told him not to bother ever calling her again.    Now she wishes she hadn't made that move because she really likes him.  She left him a message apologizing for being rude to him (even after he lied).  He stated he is not the one to be checked.  What should her next move be?

20090131111318AAkxOri	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	HUGE Family issues... Please help~ I'm not sure If I did the right Thing ?	My mom and my dad got diviorced when I was in Kindergarden, but now they are best friends.           My mom married Steve a few years later(I'm not exactly sure, but I think about 8 years ago) And now they fight ALL the time....           I understand all relation ships have a few fights, but my mom and step dad have one EVERY DAY. They Scream and fight, and hit the walls, and I'm really afraid one day He will hit her, or even try to kill her.   Iv'e Told my mom I don't like him, Iv'e told her to get a divorce. She said She will when she has the money... But I don't think We (being my mom and I ) WIll ever get 'the money'.            Steve has a 'Sometimes I'll get paid, and sometimes I won't" kinda of Job. He recently got Paid, and he is threatning to leave, If he does, My mom WIll Most likely not be able to pay house bills, and or anything else...           I use to Think they fought becasue of me, Because I was so mean to Steve, So I started being nicer, If he got me something I always said Thank-you, If he asked me a Question, I always replied "No Sir" or "Yes Sir" . If I Saw HIm DRive up in his truck, I would go unlock the door, and maybe even give him a hug....but I don't think that helped any.           Today THey Fought, and It was one of the worst. I Was in my older brother's room (who has now moved out), comforting the dogs, who pretty much think there about to die when Steve Screams. They either come to my room, (I have a cat in my room, So there not allowed in my room) Or I have to go to my brothers room...  heard Steve Hitting the wall 6 or 7 times, and got worried, so I stood up. They both went out to the garage, but left the door open, THen I heard Things Falling, and being smashed. I honestly thought STeve was trying to kill My mom, So I ran to the garage, and started screaming. They both turned around, and I realized my mom was just Throwing things on the floor, as well as breaking many things, and steve was going to his truck..My mom started Crying, so I went Inside with her, and tryed to Comfort her, but she pushed me away and told me to go to my room.           Was that the right thing to do? Or should I have just stayed in my Brother's room. Should I tell Someone? Or should I just let them work it out.....after all I'm Only 13....

My bf of two months was really sweet and great.We got on very well and we had great chemistry going. We both fall in love madly,i did for fact and he told me he loves me and never felt that way before. Lately,im getting phony excuses, vague answers,name calling and few lies thrown here and there. I do not like to waste my time but my heart was hurting whenever he does that.I tried to ignore all the red flags infront of me. He drinks alot and according to him sometimes when he is drank he doesnt know what he is saying and that is a big fat lie because he knows what he is saying and he never drinks more than 2 glass of wine. He does not bother to pick my calls anymore and i heard he is with another girl. He told me it is all trash and i love u and i dont love this girl.

20090131111032AAnIzML	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do u think my man is cheating on me?	My bf of two months was really sweet and great.We got on very well and we had great chemistry going. We both fall in love madly,i did for fact and he told me he loves me and never felt that way before. Lately,im getting phony excuses, vague answers,name calling and few lies thrown here and there. I do not like to waste my time but my heart was hurting whenever he does that.I tried to ignore all the red flags infront of me. He drinks alot and according to him sometimes when he is drank he doesnt know what he is saying and that is a big fat lie because he knows what he is saying and he never drinks more than 2 glass of wine. He does not bother to pick my calls anymore and i heard he is with another girl. He told me it is all trash and i love u and i dont love this girl. I feel sad that i know he is lying on my face and i play like idiot and he thinks i dont get this f.u.c.k.I think enuff is enuff now and i should leave him alone and tell him straight. Do you all think he is cheating on me? pls help

He tenido experiencias (varias) pero al final me decepcionan o simplemente me aburren.

20070929174835AAGBafA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Porque es tan dificil encontrar el amor, si siempre he pensado que el amor no duele,el amor es felicidad?	He buscado el amor por 20 a, tengo 39 y nunca lo he encontrado, se que esta dentro de cada ser humano, pero porque es dificil sentirlo, como encontrarlo entodas partes dicen que el que busca encuentra hasta en la biblia, pero para mi ha sido tan dificil, no me he dado por vencida, es como si dijera que he recorrido todo el mundo para encontrar a mi amor, y hasta ahorita no ha llegado me he equivocado miles de veces y despues de sufrir viene a mi mente el amor llegara porque no duele, no duele amar a tus hijos a tus padres o hermanos, entonces si amas a alguien tampoco duele, sigo en mi busqueda se que lo encontrare, pero algo tan facil para muchos ha sido dificil para mi, que se sentira ser amado, ojala lo experimente algun dia, porque nunca lo he sentido. el amor no duele y si duele no es amor.

20090131100507AA8rIie	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this joking or being rude and immature?  women and men?	i am asking this secion for mature responses. i know people joke and kid around, but i think there is a fine line between joking and being rude. my guy is in his thirties and i am as well. i am a mature women, but i like to joke and kid around. i find it offensive bc in a joking sense he has called me a n _ g _ r twice in the last three month of dating . i told him to stop, he never called me that again.  but since he has called me a son of a b _ tch in front of people- only once, dumbass in private, . he says he is just joking around. now he has only called me these names once or twice. he really says it very nicely and smiles. we arent fighting when he calls me these names. it is his way of joking or being playful. he says he is just joking and i have no sense of humor. he says he will stop since i am offended but he said he should be able to come in the house and say hi hooker- as a joke. i prefer to be called my name or baby, girl, goofy, ect.... he also has gotten drunk before and told me to shut up and i was full of **** in front of his family. that same drunk night he placed me over a 2 foot fire to joke around. he wouldnt apologize at first bc he said he was drunk and joking. he also told me while i was sick and at a family gathering - " go lay down, you look like ****". he said it nicely again and said he meant no harm. he says really nice and loving things as well , he isnt like this 24 -7. but i am noticing that he is rude, selfish, and inconsiderate as well. are these jokes i should just take or would you be offended? i have talked to him and i dont think he will stop bc it is just him.  he recently called me a fuc_ er just in a casual conversation. why would someone want to joke like that? i believe he needed to mature and communicate better. would you stick around or accept it.

20061109115000AAgXZnY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you be in love with two people at the same time?	I am very fond of two men. I think I love both of them. One has a terminal illness and the other is quite helthy. I enjoy both of their company and I'm attracted to them equally. There are some differences. I don't know who to chose. The on ewho is healthy, makes me laugh, sex and conversation is good. We're both attracted to each other and he is much more energetic and inclined to try diffrent things culturally, etc. The one who is terminal, I like as well. He's more on the lazy side but I know he loves me. I'm just not sure if he thinks he will never find anyone who will accept him as I have. He's not that inclined to try different things....more of a couch potato and an introvert. The problem is, I am not married to either one of them, I live with the one who is terminal. I have always felt with the healthy one that it was something diffrent and special. It's something I feel. Could I be just feeling sorry for the one that is terminal and not able to break his heart?

20070206062813AA1nlZg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever been cheated on and still wanted to talk it over with the guilty party?	Let's establish some facts:      a) The person cheated on you.      b) You caught the person cheating on you.      c) They even admitted cheating on you.          Did you still want to talk it over to try and resolve the issue or did you just throw your hands up in the air and say: "I'm outta here?"  Did you really want to try and work things out or were you curious as to why they cheated in the first place?  Now, for the record, this hasn't happened to me since I'm a single man as of this writing. I posed the question because of a show I saw recently where the woman knew her boyfriend was cheating and she still wanted to talk to him about their relationship.  I figured: "What's there to talk about?"  He cheated, she caught him, end of story, right?  Please respond and elaborate.

This happened last week to, and i had a blast!. We have no problem talking and other things have lead me to believe that he lieks me. Whats something that I could casually ask him to see if he might like me? Just something I could throw in, to see what he could give away.    Btw, hes the sorta quite type, Attends church reguarly (how we met), and does all the extra stuff around church, has had one real gf in 7th grade (hes now in 12th) and hes never really wanted to just hang out. Now he does. Strange.... lol :)
20080730071501AAffYGT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i go for it?	There is this guy that goes to school with me, I never used to really speak to him, but whenever I go out the people I'm with are his friends too so we started talking a lot more recently. All my male friends tell me he likes me a lot, but at first I wasn't paying attention cause he isn't really my type. Recently I've realised he's actually a really cool guy and Im starting to like him a lot. Is it normal to have fallen for someone so quickly? I just can't stop thinking about him anymore.   Also I'm really scared that if we do get into a relationship that he may end up hurting me, like he may decide he doesn't like me in that kind of way anymore but just as a friend. I really want it to work and he's always asking me when are we going to move forward as in become bf & gf....but I just don't know if to trust him.    I think most of my uncertainty is because he's like a party guy and most of his female friends are kind of skanky.

Yo nunca me habia hacercado a ningun chico que buscara solo eso en mi pero con el fue distinto porque me atraia y aun me atrae mucho fisicamente. Cuando lo conoci ya no estaba con mi novio pero despues regrese con mi novio de mas de 2 a?os de relacion y deje de ver a mi "amigo" Pero el problema es que volvi a encontrarme con este chico y volimos a tener relaciones. Yo estoy completamente clara hacerca de mi posicion con este "amigo", se que es solo sexo y nada mas. Estoy actuando mal porque he fallado a mi novio y me he dado cuenta de que el otro me sigue gustando mucho fisicamente. Algun consejo en que camino seguir?  (Por favor no ofensas al respecto de la infidelidad, estoy completamente consiente de que estoy actuando mal, pero es de humanos herrar, solo espero aprender de mis herrores y si es posible ser una mejor persona)

20090131091346AAO9bGx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	He proposed to me but...?	there's a very long story behind this.. But im going to make it short..      My boyfriend finally proposed to me on my birthday (jan. 27th) we were out with my whole family at dinner, and I realized that the ring was turning my finger green???? I whispered to my mom that we had to goto the bathroom to talk asap!! So we went to the bathrooma and I immediatly showed her the ring... I asked her "how do I bring it up to him that the ring is turning my finger green?" she didn't really help much.      So, I've been going on 4 days with my new-colored finger, wondering how to mention it to him without ruining his ego. Also, yesterday, I was "napping" but I was 1/2 awake and he happened to be looking at the ring, and seen the ring changing colors. He thought I was sleeping but he hasn't mentioned to me that he seen it...      Im upset cuz we're tight on money. And if he really felt deeply about becoming my fiancee and couldn't afford an expensive bank brraking ring, he shoulda just told me. I would've understood.. Instead, he lyed to me and said it was 4ct. And it was real 14ct white gold... how do I mention it to him that I know its changing my finger colors????

20090131094105AAZaE9L	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I located my ex gf three years back.?	I found my ex on facebook.  Thought it would be a good idea to speak to her as our break up happened so quick and we never realy spoke since.  Anyway I would send her a message now and again to say hi how you.  She only responds to my mails when something real big happens in her life.  For instance when she got married and when she discovered she was pregnant.  I dont mail often and wont mail again until she replies.  It took her 10 months to reply to the last mail.  Now she found out that she is pregnant and decided to mail me again and told me.  Am I reading into this wrong is she trying to put a hint across or prove a point. We were pritty close as friends and as partners.  I dont know what happened that she cut herself off from me for so many years.  On another point, we met when she was going out with this guy for 3 years.  She broke it off with him and we got together.  You think this is a bad thing to do as she would be on the rebound.  I feel I have an unclosed book with her and I dont know what to do about it. If I should tell her, especially now that she is married.  I only just want some anwers. Without looking like Im still missing her or whatever.
20090131094117AAY1hcN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Tired of a relationship.. Help?	Hello everyone,      I've got a bit of a problem at the moment what it is, me an my girlfriend have been going out out for about 2 years now, bit of a shaky start got to admit but we stuck with it, made it work and all is happy.      Over the last year I have spent every day with her pretty much and lost touch with my friends (my fault I know) but now I feel that its a bit too much I'm only 19 after all.      But now we rarely do anything and rarely have sex, I feel guilty when I stay at home and not see her (she stays at her parents, feels likes she's waiting for me !?!?) I pick her up and take her to college and if I don't I feel bad, we never go out any-more because of money (well she has no money) I struggle to find stuff for us to do since we don't have much in common in my opinion.      Recently I have wanted to tell her that its not working and I need to free myself up a bit 6 months into out relationship I basically split up with her about 4 times breaking her heart and now I can't bring myself to say it, obviously it shows as she keeps asking me if I'm bored and makes me promise that I won't go find some other girl, I'm so trapped what do I do I'm useless :(

20090131101254AAqY9vr	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Its Making Me Physically Ill - I Need Advice?	I've been with my gf for over 3 months and we've known each other almost 3yrs..      About 3 weeks into our relationship i noticed some strang guys appearing on her myspace in the "new friends" page, she told me about the one being nasty and what not, and said she was going to delete him, and i didnt think twice about it. Well she was over my house the one day with her laptop and a message from the guy pops up saying "hey babe" and she quickly closed it out. I asked her why she didnt delete him and tried to make it seem like he was a stalker. But long story short i messaged him, told him i was her bf and i didnt appriciate him calling her babe, and i didnt want to turn things violent so if he knows something i should, spill it.      He sent me a huge email telling me about her adult friend finder page..messages she sent about going and grinding off guys at the cell block and how she usually goes home with the bouncer etc. And what her the most was she was giving him a webcam show and tellin him to talk dirty to her..      I snapped, i flipped out, she denied, i showed her dates, times, and yahoo archive stuff and she confessed to everything. She knows ive been hurt alot in the past and she has too. She ended up taking an entire bottle of antidepressions while she was drinking. Her parents took her to the ER and she saw a shrink in the mental ward. She swore she never cheated on me, she never touched another guy, that it was just talk and she would never do it again.       Well for the last couple weeks ive been getting on her alot because if you look at her page youd never know she was taken. Im her number 1, so i usually put my pictures of her and me as my default, because otherwise no one else would know. Her page layout doesnt display relationship status, and when guys message her, she doesnt tell them shes taken. I told her that it bothers me that my pictures are in the "friends" folder, and that theres nothing on her page showing people we're together. She kept telling me it wasnt a big deal and i was just being paranoid..      Well the other day her brother found out we're engaged, she freaked out on me and i had no idea why. There really wasnt any reason to be mad, i asked her brother, other then what he was told THAT day when he called her, what did he know about me...He had never even heard of me. And i have asked her a dozen time "does your family know about me, does your brother know about me, does your brother know im coming for your bday?" and everytime it was a yes...      Well when i found out she lied about that i was really hurt, and i needed to know if i could trust her, i had a hacker buddy of mine break into her myspace account. He asked me if i just wanted to do it once he got in, but i told him if i saw something that upset me, i KNOW id end up deleteing it or change her name to like "WHORE" and then changing her passwords so she couldnt fix it. Well the dude told me that i better be sitting and sent me 5 saved offline pages. Two of them were from 2 days ago with her talking to 2 diff guys saying she was single and they should talk and hang out sometime, gave them her yahoo, and cell number. Another was from the second week of January and she messaged some guy saying "my p*ssy has a craving for some d*ck or mouth" and that went back and forth until he said "Any time, im always ready, you know how to get ahold of me"      I didnt sleep at all last night after i found out all this stuff..I confronted her this morning, and at first she was just trying to get me to tell her who got into her myspace account. I ended up flipping out and telling her thats really not whats important, who caught her doesnt change the fact thats shes caught! And she went into the same story she used before "im sick, i have an addiction!" and i flipped out saying it didnt matter because almost every message was sent WHILE SHE WAS TALKING TO ME, lik

And she went into the same story she used before "im sick, i have an addiction!" and i flipped out saying it didnt matter because almost every message was sent WHILE SHE WAS TALKING TO ME, like actually durring our conversations. Again she told me she didnt cheat, that it was all talk and basically broke down. I asked how she could do that stuff and not feel guilty when she says "i love you to me".      I really dont know what to do, my heart cant take another hit like this. Even if their was no physical contact she was fantasizing about other guys WITH other guys. She says its not cheating...but its almost just as bad. It might as well be. The first time she did this i made a handful of demands...no more clubs, no more talking to those guys etc. Now, i flipped out, i told her that there is no more avoiding it, if she wants to be with me, She better make it obvious she has a boyfriend and TELL PEOPLE THAT when they message her. But im really not sure if thats enough...she has like 200 ppl on yahoo and i can bet that over 8/10th are guys..
20090131101753AApcpVj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He wants to break up!!?	Hi I have lived as a domestic partner with this guy for the past three years. we have argued a lot during that time. he is anal about all kinds of stuff, is a pretty miserable person, and always wants to be right. he talks down to me and pretty much anyone elee he comes in contact with that doesnt agree with him . christmas eve was the fight of fights i told him he needs a "yes woman" someone who will say yes no sir, he came into the living area and tossed a full glass of merlot in my face full blast, he apologised and said he shouldnt have done it, but he uses such nasty words to me like f   kng ***** etc. he is course and callous a lot with me and he doesnt come up to my expectations of what someone who claims to love me should be like, I was told he wants to split and move out, but he still wants to date me and be monogamous, he said he just cant live with me. I on the other hand told him i am moving back to ohio where my kids are (they are grown) I am so confused and upset most of the time i cant think straight

20090131102605AAN6Mjx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex wants me to pack food, milk, $$$ ect for my son when he takes him for a visit, is this ridiculous or what?	My ex husband takes maybe 3 visits with my son per year. He always has some excuse why he can't see his son. Last time he called and said he was too sick to see him, then that very night my brother was seated next to him and his date at a comedy club. So clearly my son is not a priority. He only pushes visitation when someone in his life reminds him he has a son. He refuses to pay his court ordered child support. He is a true deadbeat in every single sense.    My son is allergic to Gluten and Casein. This limits his diet pretty intensely. My ex has recently drafted a letter to my husband and I demanding that we provide him with enough food for a weekend, plus my son's vitamins, pull ups and 65 dollars "petty cash" just in case my son has additional needs while he is with him. I don't know what floors me more, the fact that he has the balls to draft out such a letter, or the fact that he has had it notorized and mailed to me (thus adding witness to his idiocy)   I am of the mind that as a parent when my son is with him, it is his responsibility to feed him, and entertain him and have funds on hand just in case. My ex counters that the foods allowed for my son are so expensive (some are pretty pricey, but we do it!) that feeding him for a weekend will break his bank.    It is almost like he expects us to pay him to take care of his own child, who he refuses to care for anyhow.    Who else thinks this is ridiculous. Anybody else have similar stupidity to deal with? I am still blown away!

I really have no male friends (I'm a male) and that has been bothering me lately.      I really couldn't relate to anyone in this group of about 30 people and I was so miserable every week that now I have quit the club. I seem to think other guys are too abnormal or they will think I am.       The guy I got closest to from that group acted like a bomb went off in his head and did major damage. The guy I most respected treated me like you would a troubled child, kindly but with displeasure.      I am almost 50, but in some ways I am like a very intelligent child, and I feel like teenagers are more mature than I am, but I can't really relate well to people who were born after 1980. They have no idea what the world is about.      I can't pick someone not to well off not too poor, not too young but not too grown up, not too sane but not too crazy. This whole thing is crazy making.      Why is it so hard for me to relate to anybody?

20090131132258AAlhS3G	Family & Relationships;Friends	What does it really mean to have 'a life'?	I mean, I think I have a life, but sometimes I'm not so sure and I'm wondering if where I am is going to be it, if you know what I mean. I'm not unhappy or depressed, great family, educated, interesting career, make really good money, expensive new car, and all the bling and stuff that I want. Not really in the market for a relationship right now (cuz I kinda suck at them. lol) I have some friends but they're pretty boring so I travel and do things that I like on my own or with acquaintances that I hook up with now and then for tennis, movies, or other social stuff like that. This is what 'a life' is kinda sorta supposed to be like, right? So why do I feel like I'm missing something?       Most of the people my own age that I know are the married with children yuppie types---and they're mostly 'show' people---the kind who dress up in designer clothes and expensive jewelry and step out in their Mercedes and BMWs and Audis to some place around town where they know they will be seen and talked about. The parties I get invited to are full of people like that who gossip all evening long about one another and the stuff that they have. I'm a more down to earth, laid back type of dude, and I don't particularly find any of that look-at-me stuff very interesting. I'm no longer married and don't have any kids, so I'm thinking that I need a new scene but don't know what to do.        Am I crazy or does anyone else out there feel like this?
20090131125844AAZnV9a	Family & Relationships;Family	Age 18 and under-how do you feel about your parents?	Do you feel like they love you and sacrifice for your education and for you to develop talents (sports, art, dance music, etc,)?  Do they listen to you when you talk?  Or-do you think they are too caught up in their own lives to care what you do as long as you don't embarrass them or cost them money?  Or  worse yer, are they trying to force you to be the perfect child (by their definition) instead of letting you be the unique person you were born to be?

20090131111819AAgUfOL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Happily married couples: Advice on REAL romance (writing) again?	I'm writing a "Dr Horrible" fanfiction-story, you see, with romance. The horrible dilemma is that, having no significantly romantic experiences of my own, I have no idea if what I am writing is possible/probable (within the supervillain-genre "absurdity", of course) or if it's just a product of Hollywood's dramatic ideal. The relationship started with the two on opposing sides, with one a bit judgmental and irritated feelings toward the other, which might just be unlikely in the first place; I really don't know. By this time, though, they've warmed up to each other enough to recognize their feelings. This is the first kissing scene. It occurs immediately after the female finds out that the male is not dead. No matter if it's cliche-- it's what you do with the idea, I believe; there is nothing new under the sun. So, please, any advice?      Characters in this scene--   Tie Die: Supervillainess, female lead   Dr. Horrible: Supervillain, male lead   Moist: Dr. Horrible's sidekick:      “Don’t—ever—do—that—again!” she shouted as she squeezed the living guts out of Horrible. By about the time that his face turned purple, she let her arms hang loose and her sobbing body fell limply into the stunned doctor’s hands. He stood stiffly for a moment, and then struggled to lift her up, managing to get her head onto his shoulders as her arms wrapped loosely around him.      Finally she pushed herself up to see his face. It was smudged with something dark and his goggles were pushed up, exposing his tired eyes. She didn’t hesitate to dive forward, smashing her lips on his own that were slightly opened in surprise.      He squirmed for a minute, stunned almost as much as Tie Die herself, who grasped his shoulders for stability as she leaned forward.      He tasted like chocolate chip cookie.      Abruptly she broke the kiss, turning her body away from him and to the upturned lab. She heard Horrible attempt to formulate syllables. “Not a word.” She paused. “You startled me, that’s all.” Another pause. She spun around, putting her hands on her hips. “All right, now, we’re going to get this place cleaned up. I don’t care if you are a mad scientist; this place is hardly even livable.”      Horrible stammered and slowly raised a glove to his lips, halfway pursing them then stopping. He lowered his arm. “Right, right. I’ve—been working too hard on the inventions—never fixed anything after the sacking, other than the furniture--”      Tie Die sighed and bent down to her knees to pick up some of the diagrams spread out on the floor. She noticed her arm was shaking. Suddenly she felt a warm body press against her back, and Billy’s lab-coat-covered arms wrapped around her belly.      “I missed you, too,” he whispered.      Her immediate reaction would have been to swing around and hit him, but she stopped herself before she had a chance. She didn’t move, although she found her muscles relaxing as she leaned back into him and just… was.      They both stayed there for a minute or two, feeling the other’s presence somehow more appreciatively than Tie Die had thought possible.      Just then, she heard the door open.      Jumping out of Billy’s arm, she spun around and saw the man she recognized as Moist, sans the fake mustache and holding a gallon of milk.      Moist had stopped short when he saw Horrible and Tie Die curled up together. He stared for a moment, perspiring, then glanced back out the door. “Um, do you want me to bring the milk in later? ‘Cause, you know, if you two want some privacy…”      Horrible scrambled up as Tie Die fumbled for words.      “I, we, she, no! I mean, that’s okay, Moist, we were just… cleaning up,” Horrible stuttered.      Moist rubbed his arm. “Really? It didn’t look like--”      “No, we were cleaning up,” Tie Die said firmly.         ---      Once again, I doubt that anyone read the entire thing. I am not looking for blind compliments-- I want to know if this scene works. Also, bear in mind that this is NOT a PG-13 or higher story. This is as graphic as it will get.      Thank you!

He said he wished he could transfer my illness onto himself, because he knows how irritating it can be to feel sick.      What do you think, was he just being nice or is there something more?

It's okay actually as I tend to prefer older men in their 40's. The one main guy I like at the moment is actually 47.    If you are an older guy do you find a woman like me attractive and would you consider dating me?   Also I maybe look a bit younger than my age would that bother you?

20090131131636AA9dJkR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my husband doing that?	I like sex very much, I always want to have sex with my husband, I could have sex with him 24/7 and I would never get enough !!! But he's always tired to make sex with me, I kind of have to beg him or ask a lot. before we got married, we used to make love a lot, even 3 times in a night, before we sleep, in the middle of the night, when we wake up before to get ready to go to work, when we come from work and before to sleep again etc... I did things with him that I never did before like having sex in my ***, drinking his sperms etc... but 1 month after the wedding, things have changed, if I don't ask for it, he can even make 1 month without touching me. But, I always catch him watching porn on his computer and when I arrive, he turns it down or off, so I can see from that that he's really interested into sex but he prefers to watch it on his computer than having sex with me???... what's the problem, what does that mean? what should I do? And I know he's not teaching on me, but why he watches sex on his computer and worse, watches it alone and hides it from me? and I always make myself beautiful, sexy etc... it's only been 5 months that we're married and not even 1 year that we know each other sexually...

20090131132444AAiQnWS	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you know if someone is your friend or not?	Because I have this "friend". I met her when I was 7 (I'm 14 now) during dance class. She's been my friend ever since then, but she makes me mad a lot. She does things that I really don't like, and I always get this feeling she's lying to me. For example- At football and basketball games she always sits with her mom and expects me to sit with her, instead of sitting with my friends, and I always sit with her. I would rather sit with my other friends and boyfriend though. Every time she says something that I don't understand she starts screaming at me and gets really mad. She makes funny faces all the time at me, it's like she's giving me dirty looks or something. Every time I'm talking about someone she tells me she hates them, when she doesn't hardly know half of them. When she talks to me she talks about all these "popular" high school kids like they're her best friend, but she doesn't know them. She does other stuff too and some of it really bothers me. The thing is, I like her. She's one of my best friends, and I don't know how I could stop being her friend. She really bothers me and makes me mad though. What do I do?
20090131131439AAJVDtY	Family & Relationships;Friends	My freind is ignoring me now.?	I had a friend from last year and he is completely ignoring me now. This year everything was cool and then when I would say hi to him- he wouldn't respond back. I figured he didn't hear me and didn't really care. But then this just kept going on. I told a mutual friend of ours and she said its because he thinks I like him. Which is NOT the case.... AT ALL! Anyways, I dropped saying hi to him and we don't even speak at all anymore. I can't tell him I don't like him because he won't even give me the time of day anymore, and he'll probably just think I'm lying. Any suggestions to what I can do.

20090131131802AAJlCMc	Family & Relationships;Family	Did anyone else grow up with alcoholic parents?	My dad's been an alcoholic basically my whole life. It doesn't help now that he's retired, so all he does every day is go to his favorite bar in the morning and come home drunk in the afternoon. He's abused me and my siblings emotionally, mentally, and in the past physically...but after getting arrested multiple times, being confronted by us about it, going to counseling, he's never changed and I get the feeling he never will. My mom never brings it up and when he's sober he seems to forget everything that happened when he drinks and he pretends everything's fine.      It's frustrating, wanting to help someone who refuses to help themselves...but at the same time, I'm so sick of dealing with him that part of me just wants to stop caring at all and let him wallow in his own misery.      My question to you is, have any of you been in similar boats? How do feel about your parents? How is your relationship?

I'm not trying to be cheap I am just not familiar with the etiquette. Do wedding shower gifts generally differ from bridal shower gifts (in other words, is the bridal shower gift FOR the bride or both the bride and the groom?) and do I bring a gift to the bachelorette party or does the bridal shower cover that part?

20090131111901AAkX0Sb	Family & Relationships;Family	Please could you help with my family problem?	I'm sorry this is compex and long, but i really need advice.      One of my uncles is staying with my grandmother. My grandmother has complained to my father that she wishes he weren't there, but dare not throw him out because he is her son (understandably). The problem is that my father and other uncle believe that he is causing her problems by being there, and have told her that they need to know within a week whether she wants him there or not, and if not they will make him move out.      Now, my father thinks that i am being ridiculous by saying that it is unfair to pressure my grandmother into making a decision, and that it will cause as much emotional damage to her to decide to let him stay or not. Also, i feel that things could turn violent between my father and my uncle if he refuses to leave, and to be honest, it's not my father's place to force him to leave (should social services not do this?)      So my problem is that i'm standing up for my grandmother and uncle, by not allowing my father to force her to make a decision, which my father has a problem with.      What should i do?

20090131131842AAGUO5I	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Filing for divorce.  Does the "victim" get a better settlement?	I'm writing a story where the husband is trying to get his wife to file for divorce.  She's in love with him, but he doesn't love her anymore.  Therefore, he does underminded things in the relationship to get her to pull the trigger and file for divorce; because he doesn't want to do it himself.      Now I need to find the motivation for that.  What would be the benefit for him to make her look like the bad guy and file against him?  If he's the "victim" in the court, could he get a better settlement if she's the one with money and also wanted the divorce?      Or these days does it not matter with "no-fault divorce" laws?  Are those in every state?      Thanks for your help!

I need real advice and not any put downs please. For one, I know I should not have dated this man while he was "separated" and should have waited until he was completely divorced. But one thing led to another and we ended up liking each other a lot. I want to clarify that he and his wife were NOT together when we started dating, they had already been separated for a few months, but they are still legally married and in the process of finalizing divorce. He claims that the love in their relationship ended long ago, and that he is in love with me.      Now it is catching up to me. I realize that he has more baggage to deal with than he is letting on to me. The stupid part is that I found out via blogging sites - his "ex" wife blogs about how they still fight and how he still brings up the fact that he's done a lot for her through the years. Long story short - it sounds to me like he has been downplaying what is going on with their divorce to me so that I wouldn't be scared off.       ****I know their divorce is none of my business****   BUT - I also want to know what I'm getting myself into so that I'm not completely blind to what is happening. I feel like he is keeping things from me because he knows I would be upset, and now I feel like our relationship has been a good "distraction" for him instead of  "real love." For this reason, I decided I'm going to break it off today. We have plans to meet up later.      How do I tell him what I just said, without saying "Oh I saw your wife's blog and thats how I know that you guys still have some obvious unresolved issues and strong feelings going on" ?? If I just tell him my assumption without the proof, he will just deny it and beg me not to break it off (we've been through this one time before when I really did bring it up as just a mere assumption). So what to do ?      Again, I just need some mature answers, please don't bother answering if you want to put me down. I'm human. I looked at her blog because I was curious and I was being nosy. Didn't expect to read about their explosive fights that are STILL apparently going on. It made me feel like he has feelings for her and I feel betrayed as he has been telling me that he loves me so much. I just don't want to be lied to.

I mean for a boy, you will just say a simple 'bye' or 'see ya'. But when your on about a girl, how do you end it? They'll usually end by 'xxxxx'. But how would I reply back to a girl ending a convo with 'xxxxx'??? Do I do the same?????      This sounds a little embarassing, lol.      Thanks.

20090131113250AAr5iT6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Laid off with a child support arrearage, can I get it reduced/?	Two years ago i was ordered to pay 17 years retroactive child support on a child I did not know even existed.  I have no idea when I slept with her mother, but the DNA test says I'm the father.        My attorney says the child was born in Las Vegas, but her mother is under no obligation to say where we met.  I don't drink, so I didn't get drunk and do something dumb. The only time I visited Vegas was with my girlfriend, whose now my wife.  This has created a stain in our marriage, but we are now wondering if she was a hotel maid and took one of my used condoms.  Either that or I had a lot more fun in Vegas than I knew.      In either case, after taking our savings, our home, my retirement fund, my children's college fund, and any other assets, I still owe $96,000 in back child support and Sprint has laid me off.  I still have to pay support while she's in college, and pay for the college education.  What do I do now?

20090131114804AAcG0Ac	Family & Relationships;Family	How should I deal with this? My mom abandoned us for another man.?	I'm 17 years old and I have an 11 year old autistic brother. Both of us were very close with our mom, up until about a year ago. She started playing World of Warcraft at night because her and my dad never got along (they were just "staying together for the kids" kinda thing) and my mom was lonely, so she turned to this online world for attention. Five months later, she moved out, divorced my dad, and my brother and I moved in with her (because of our ill-relationship with our dad). But, the whole time we were staying with her, she would lock herself in her room talking on the phone and playing on the computer, and never spend any time with us kids. Then, two days before Christmas, she moved her internet boyfriend across the US to move in with us, but didn't consult us first. He left his wife and 3 kids under the age of 5 to move in with my mom, so he obviously isn't right in the head. He also lied about his job, saying that he makes a lot of money, and now he just mooches off of my mom.    Anyways, after this happened, I called my dad and he said that we had to move back in with him because he didn't feel as though we were safe in that environment. So now me and my brother feel helpless and as though our mom has abandoned us for her freaky boyfriend and his kids (whom he's moving in with them). We feel replaced and have told her many times that we want to see her, however, she says that her "new life" is more important. How should I deal with this? Should I move on and forget about her? What should I tell my brother (who's autistic and is very depressed/confused about the whole situation)? Is there any way I can convince her to be apart of our lives and dump her boyfriend?

At first it started out with one big girl, but now it seems like he has a big girl  problem and wont admit to it. My friend is a little shy and timid. He is soft spoken and writes poems, and reads books under trees. I do question his lack of sex and sexuality at times but he is a good friend of mine so i dont think he would "come out" the closet. How should I talk to him about his standards? I am able to pull girls like nothing, but the girls I get, he has a problem because they are too young and immature, but at least they look good! What should I do?

20090131125439AAmA66H	Family & Relationships;Family	Help! I fear that I'm becoming a bad mother?	I really need some advice. My son and I have just emigrated to America to be with my new husband and my sons father. My husband works nights, until 2:30am and therefore sleeps most of the day (until about midday) but because he has to go to work again at 4pm he won't help out, even though I've asked for his help.       My 3 year old is VERY clingy. If i'm not looking at him when he wants my attention he will actually grab my face and pull it to face him, in the morning when he gets up, he prises my eyes open and tells me 'the sun is up mommy'. I have no car, no friends and no help. My husband thinks its funny that I am so stressed because he thinks i live a life of luxury because I'm at home and I don't work. My guilt over not having energy for my son stops me from having any kind of life at all. My husband wants us to spend time together but I am reluctant because my son will cry if I leave him with any one other than his play school teacher. If I get a sitter it will break his heart.      My son is NEVER abused and never neglected of hugs and kisses. In fact he gets plenty of them because all i want to do is sit and cuddle, its just when it comes to playing with him when I have no energy or patience. 5 minutes playing with him feels like an hour and all I can think about is 'I hope this will tire him out' or 'i hope that after this he will leave me alone'.      I enrolled him into day care 2 mornings a week as that is all we can afford but its not enough. He comes home still wanting to play and I still have no energy because my time alone wasn't fulfilling, I just sit there in silence, or watching bad day time TV because my husband is asleep and I don't have a car. I count the hours down until its my sons bedtime and when I go to bed I get woken up at least twice because he needs the bathroom. In the morning I'm still exhausted, my son instantly wants to play and I just snap because I'm so tired and irritable. My skin is pale and I have deep, dark purple circles under each eye.I look a mess and I feel it too. I fear that my misery is making my son miserable, and I really don't want to screw him up psychologically but I can't seem to snap out of it. In fact, the more this goes on the more irritable I get at myself and others because I don't have the strength to rectify it.      Please help

Well, I have this best friend, and her Name is Alyssa too. She and I hated each other in 6th grade and to this day we still have no clue why but, anyways, last year in 7th grade we became like really good friends but not best friends. Now this year and over the summer we are like best friends, inseparable(idk how to spell that) but I still have a feeling she talks about me and says mean things about me.I know I don't talk about her but people keep telling her I do, and I keep telling her I don't and yeah i guess it's just a huge mess at this point. But yeah, so know my other friend Amanda just told me that when I wasn't at school Thursday, that Alyssa was saying thing about me like ow I think she is my best Friends and that Alyssa was scootching  in her chair really close to the table and said I will never be able to scoot in that far up to a table. I know its stupid but it still hurts. When I called Alyssa today and asked her if she said those things, she denied it, and now I dont know who to beleive. Well please just give me your opinion or advice because I really need it right now! Thanks!

There is this guy that I met in one of my classes who knows I have a boyfriend, but seems to keep on hitting on me. He always invites me out to the movies and to dinner and won’t let me bring my boyfriend along because he doesn't want to feel like he is a "third wheel". When I bring up my concerns with him, he tells me that we are just friends and gets mad at me over the situation, but to me it seems like he wants more. My boyfriend does not like him because this guy keeps taking me out to dinner alone, but I am afraid to hurt both of their feelings. I don't know what to do or how to handle this.

20090131131500AAYXTZI	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friendship problem?	i really need to talk to someone about this, but i think i'd sound like a complete *****. so i figured i'd ask it on here.   has anyone ever had an argument with a friend & they're asking: "why are you being off with me? why haven't you been talking to me lately?" & you actually don't know. but it's like you've grown sick of the person. desirable qualities become annoying & you don't want to be around them anymore. but you don't want to say to them: "sorry but im sick of you." because that's really mean. instead all this tension builds up & there are outbursts. i found myself crying yesterday, tears of frustration. i never cry in public...i feel ashamed.    so basically, im asking, has anyone else ever been in this situation or felt like this? What did you do? How did it work out?   thanks

This would not bother me as we're pretty broke except shortly before buying my ring he bought an LCD TV and an XBox.  All together, he spent 3 times as much on himself as he did on my engagement ring. I know the ring doesn't matter but I can't help but feel bad that he would get the cheapest one possible.  He even told me that he was considering a bigger one but went for the smaller.  Am I right in feeling bad? All of our guy friends saved money to buy their girlfriends nice rings.

I like his personality a lot and we have lot in common, but I do not want to tell him that I like him bc he has a gf.      I never liked anyone like this, never wanted to have a bf till I met him. I don't know wht to do now. :(. I like him but can't tell him because he has a gf. Whenever he sees me, he totally ignores whatever he was doing or talkig to and talks 2 me. What sld I do?
20090131132039AATzCZa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should we stay together?	I have been with this man 4 years and am 3 months pregnant with our 3rd child.   I pay for all the bills, food and half the rent and all he pays is the other half of rent.  I haven't been out with my friends since being with him as he gets very paranoid and anxious.  I have been fair and try to help him by making him feel secure, but  now i'm starting to resent him as I feel like a prisoner.  He is good with the kids although he say's if I go out he won't look after them he will take them to his mums, which I think why should his mum have them.  HELP!!!  By the way neither of us have ever cheated

20090225090020AAHyusz	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you have a relative that you love, but you also have resentments towards because of their "ways"..read more?	I have a close relative who I do love. One moment she can be a very sweet person; but, overall she is a very SELFISH person. The thing is, I don't think she even "realizes" what she's doing. She expects people to pretty much "pay" for everything without contributing.    I do love her; but, because of her "funky ways", I have lost some respect for her and have resentments too. I don't like resentments, because they create tension in relationships.   Do you have someone you love in your family, but don't like their ways??
20090131141923AAhcoDy	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do we tell her she can't be a brides maid (please read)?	OK so one of my bestest friends is  going to get married in like 2 years (she'll be 20 by then)    and she's picking out her brides maid right now  she always planned to have 6 but now she changed her mind and wants only four.  she said that for sure I'm going to be her bridesmaid no matter what because we've been best friends our whole entire lives.    anyway one of our other friends who happens to be a bit younger than both of us assumed that she's going to be one of the bridesmaids.    she's way to young and my friend isn't that close with her. how do we tell her without upsetting her or hurting her feelings
20090225090501AAfqHwx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation?	sorry I posted this earlier but I need some more advice..       my boyfriend and I had a break, during which he decided the relationship wasn't working for him anymore, then said he couldn't be without me.. two days later he's wondering if his first decision was right, but within a few hours is regretting even saying it because he doesn't feel that way.      we used to end up spending so much time together that we had no breathing space of our own - we needed more time with friends.       i'm worried he is going to start wondering again if we're doing the right thing by staying together, he says he loves me, but is wondering if it's more of a friendship-type love, even though that's not what he wants.      we've been together for nearly two years, and for two years we've been very close.. Im worried that more space apart is going to drive the wedge in even further.       how can we salvage this? - please don't say leave him because we want to work this through      thanks x

20090131143235AAP5lTM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Opinions please.....?	A girl I dated and knew as a child moved away, I hadn't talked or seen her for years up until a few years ago when I went and visited her and her family. While I was there she asked me out and I declined because I didn't want a long distance relationship. Up until about a week ago I hadn't talked to her since.    She text messaged me and we talked and exchanged pictures via text/picture messaging, she has become very beautiful, I am, at best, average. She always started the conversations, except once, but never really said much, I usually said bye or just stopped text messaging her. She often messaged me early in the morning and late at night as well as on/off throughout the day.    It's been a few days since I last got a text message from her, do you think she is waiting for me to text her? What do you think she may want? I just don't want to bug her or anything like that.

20090131142607AAL0i6o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think this girl likes me?	Does she like me, just want to be my friend, or is she using me?   so there is this girl in my calculus class who i like but i'm not sure if she likes me back or not. she sits next to me and talks to me every day before anyone else. she asks me to study with out of class too. recently i asked her to study with me. when we met up she bought me tea and then afterward drove me to class and later back to my car. when we study she talks about her ambitions about the future sometimes and about her life in general. she also texts me about things she could easily find out in class 3 hours later.      The reason i'm not sure if she likes me or not is because she does talk to other guys in my class sometimes and tells them about her life as she does with me (but not in as much detail). Even though i talk to her she doesn't wait for me after class or anything like that.      I thought she may also just be using me to help her study and get better grades. she's not dumb or anything, but im one of the smart people in the class, and i thought the study sessions might be something she is just trying to use to her advantage.      So what do you think?

Even if they were your best friend, and you had tons of friends who are the opposite gender, would you do that to your best friend?      so okay, i basically then told him i think im kind of falling for him, and i ask him in a joke way "so who do you like?"   and he literally replies   "no one, really."

The other day, I needed to borrow one of my sisters running shoes since i had washed mine and were still drying. So i went into my sister Kandice's room looking for her nike's and i see the tv on which it was porn, and i thought it was my sister Kandice watching it cuz i glanced and saw some one sitting near the tv watching. i ignored until i said "Kandice where are your nikes so I can borrow them to go jogging" then she didnt answer so I went up to her from behind and it wasnt Kandice it was my 10 year old sister sitting there with a dil dough in her hand and had head phones on listening. I was in shock that she wasnt discusted by it and i took off the head phones and turned the tv off which i calmly spoke to her asking her what she was doing in Kandices room and where did she gets this porn, and she told me that she wanted to see beauty and the beast movie which is a cartoon and found that dvd that said Beauty and the Beast but yet didnt have the cartoon figures on the dvd so she put it on and was amused by it. Shoud I tell Kandice about Daphney being in her room and watching the dvd and having her dil dough in her hand? or should i keep it to myself and watch out for her if she does it again?

My boyfriend who i was with for 16months has supposed to of cheated on me by getting with someone else while he was with me, for a " laugh ".   But he tells me they never met and only got together online, but i read his emails and there from her saying " oh we have to met babes " and that was only 3months ago.   He finally told me everything the other day.   She told me they had oral sex and nothing else.   But i really don't know what to do.   Its just one thing i thought my boyfriend would never do to me, i love him so much, but it's so hard to forgive and forget.      What do you think i should do?

20090131143605AAhC6nQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean if a guy refers to the time you spend together as "hanging out"?	This guy I like asked me to go to the movies with him, alone, last week. I knew he liked me but I wasn't sure how I felt so I insisted on paying for my own ticket so it wouldn't seem like a date date. Then he calls me and says, "it was great to finally hang out with you alone." Then he asks me if I'm going to the spring ball in April and if anyone's asked me yet. And I say "I don't know if I'll be going yet, but I usually go with my girlfriends". Then he calls me and invites himself over to my place on Valentine's day (he said not next saturday but the one after that). And he says that he can't wait to "hang out" again. Ok, so I'm getting mixed vibes and I don't know if he likes me, or he just wants to be friends, or is being cautious since I haven't given him the green light that I'm ready for a relationship. After getting to know him more over the past week, I've developed strong feelings for him so I want this to go somewhere. HELP!

20090225091613AA40yP5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! How do i deal with my boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. We attend a boarding school, where there are strict rules about what you can and can't do. A few weeks ago, I slept in his room, and we had sex for the first time. Everything was fine, except after getting a stomach virus, I was a little concerned I might have been pregnant.       Last night, we were making out in my room and we got in trouble by our counselors and they called our parents. i'm not one to get in trouble. It causes a lot of stress....We talked a lot last night and I really want to work this out, and so does he. But we are both kind of questioning if not having the relationship would be less stressful. I know it wouldnt. I love him and he is my best friend but for some reason, the words don't seem to come out. My solution right now, is that for lent, we are only allowed to hug and give little kisses. Is this a good idea?  Then we can find alternative things we like to do and see how it works....help, any suggestions? (by the way, for clarification, I am in high school)

20090131132832AA3U7sL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Pre-Nuptial agreement questions.?	Let's say a woman and man get married, but he has to sign a pre-nuptial agreement beforehand because she has a lot of money.  I suspect that these pre-nuptial agreements usually say that if he filed for divorce or cheated on her then they would divorce and he would get nothing of her money.      But what if she was the one who cheated?  And what if she was the one who filed for divorce against him who didn't want it?      Is the PA still valid?  Can he still potentially get a settlement of her wealth if she's the one who instigated the the divorce or affair?      Or do most PAs have an all around clause basically saying "No matter who's at fault in the divorce, the husband would still get nothing".
20090225091856AAbAo1h	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is he attracted to me? Kinda Inappropriate...?	I've been seeing this counselor/psychic since last year. He helped me through a lot and and i was able to vent and he's VERY intelligent and  great to talk to and spiritual and all that...   Problem is that after our first meeting  he started calling a lot (like everyday) just to talk. I'm not sure if he does that with all his clients. We would talk about real personal stuff too like sex. (I'm 20 he's about 41 married with a daughter)... Sometimes i feel like he would ask these questions about my sex life and he would say it was for comparison with other clients and to help them but i dunno? Another thing is that he started in with this thing of "okay you love me like a brother right?". And sometimes he would call me and say "Hi my baby!" At first i didn't mind then i started to feel a little weird. Another time i hadn't returned his phone call for 3 days and when i spoke to him he told me off and said "Im not gonna be treated like a jerk-off so your on probabtion we aren't speaking until 2 weeks from now!" And he was mad and hung up on me! ... Another time we were talking about my ex-boyfriends penis sizes and stuff (dont ask he brought it up) and when i told him that my ex was really big he wouldnt let up the topic and asked me "Why do i feel jealous of this?"... I don't want to end my relationship w/ him because he has become more like a friend now but from objective point of view what do u think of this?? And please don't respond with anything nasty or gross...i wouldn't do it to you..Thanks..

20090225090436AAtWxhd	Family & Relationships;Friends	Annoying friend trouble?	I have this friend who is really lovely, funny and kind, but she is incredibly annoying. I know, I know, I sound evil, but she really gets on my nerves. You see, I like this book series, and I told her that. Nearly a day after she was chatting to me about it, after having looking it up. This was fine for a while. Then, she started talking about a character she had added into the story line. This was fine too. But soon after, she wouldn't talk of anything else. I would want to talk to her about something, or talk to someone else, and she would always come out with something her 'new' character had done. It really, really annoys me. I dread going into school for fear of her talking to me. I once even turned down an offer to go to a party because I knew she would be there. Don't get me wrong, she is a great friend, and I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings by ignoring her (though sometimes I have to). She is really sensitive, but doesn't get the message if you tell her to be quiet. I  just wanted to know what the little people out there would do if they were in my position. Any answer appreciated! Thank you!!

20090131143655AAcoTzf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I avoid blushing/getting shy around really pretty girls?	So there's this one girl I know, in school. She's in all of my classes. She's like 5'7'', green eyes, and brown hair. At first I tried talking to her a little bit, to get to know her. She told me her name and we became... well, good acquaintances. I grew to like her a bit more, over time, and started to get a bit shy.    Then one day - this is going to sound weird, but I guess I'm weird for attention to so much detail - she came to school dressed up really nicely. Like, she styled her hair really nicely (curly-wavy like, I don't know what the style is called), and wore this grey sweater above a purplish-brown dress, really sexy hose (they looked kind of thick for hose, and they were like a greyish-brown like taupe), and high heels that look like the ones in the link in these brackets (http://blog.theshoegoddess.com/alessandr... except they were like 3 1/2 inches high and brown. Her face looked super pretty, like no blemishes and really nice make-up and stuff, and she had this really nice perfume and stuff. I started blushing and I could feel my heart beat. It's always when girls dress nice that I get shy. I wanted to compliment her on her looks, but I was too shy to go up to her. She wears those clothes every now and then, I don't know if she just wants to look nice or if she's dressing up for something.    Is it normal to blush and get shy when girls dress up so nicely? How do I control it? There's no need for me to be shy, she's really nice and sweet and smart (like not top student but she does good and she doesn't judge and yeah), so how do I stop?

He always tells me that because of what we go through he cannot take care of his baby. I just got a new phone and he does not have my new number. He is so pissed that he doe not have it. I refuse to give it too him because he told me that if I dnt give it to him the relationship with his daughter will not work. I am fed up with these excuses that he gives me as a father. I want nothing to do with him. He doesnt give me anything for her, I would have to hear it from someone else that he has money on him. Its hard now and chils support wont give me anything because he is not working and they wont take it out of his SSI check. So he says that if I dnt give him the number he will not be around. I asked him for what reason does he want my number. he says that its because its meeting half way. He doesnt do anything for my baby for me to meet him half way. What do I do? give him the number or not? I just dnt believe that he will change if I give him my number.

One day he decided to download this computer game and play it but its gotten waaaay out of control. He plays it literally every second of every minute day in and day out. He hardly even sleeps at night because hes to busy playing his game. Also if something happens on the game he gets violent and starts slamming doors and banging on the computer while cussing at it. This has been going on for 3 months straight now. Hes to old to be living at home without a job and not paying rent while eating all the food and running up the electric bill. Also my parents fight all the time because of him.

20090225091837AAqyF8Y	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What part of my household expenses should my boyfriend pay?	My boyfriend is suppose to move in with me.  I own my home and pay a mortgage of about $800.  He thinks he should pay only 1/2 of the utilities and none of the house note since it is my house.  I think he should pay at least part of the house note since he is living in the house.  My thinking is that he would have to pay rent if he lived elsewhere so why wouldn't he at least pay part of the house expenses.  I want to be fair.
20090131141955AA8NOHF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband can't find & keep a job...?	My husband and I got married 2,5 years ago and we have one toddler and one baby is due next month.    Because of that I am not working, we also both believe that it's the man's job to provide for the family. We are pretty traditional and religious. My husband is a good man, he doesn't drink or do drugs, he doesn't go out to clubs or bars, doesn't cheat and is God fearing.   He seems to be willing to work hard for us, he has worked 2 jobs at times, 12 hour shifts, with no complaints. But he cannot seem to find a good job that will keep him. They keep laying him off, job after job, or he only gets temporary assignments. And he used to be motivated to look for another job immediately, but lately he has zero motivation, doesn't even try to find a job. All he does now is spend time, play videogames with his brother, nephew and friends who are all unemployed, lazy, weed smoking single guys. I HATE him being around them. The more time he spends with them, the lazier he gets and he seems to forget that he has a family.    It bothers me, because we are struggling. There is no money coming in, rent is due tomorrow and we have zero. I have no idea what to tell the landlady.    I have been complaining a lot the last months and it has caused a lot of frustration and stress on our relationship and has driven him even further away. He's always at his brother's now, he avoids me, doesn't want to spend time with me, he hardly calls me. I cannot get thru him anymore. As soon as he's out of the house he completely forgets about me and his son.   I do plan on going to work when my babies are older, but I do not want to go to work so he can become lazy. I will rather kick him out than to take care of a grown man. But I do believe in marriage and I refuse to give up. No man is perfect, I am very thankful I don't have a cheater or alcoholic or atheist. But he needs to change.   I want to hear advice on how i can help him be motivated and keep a job. And how i can pull him away from his loserfriends? I want him to take responsibility and be a man. He can see his friends and brother but not every frickin day.

She doesn't let me hang out with ANY of my friends who are Hispanic/black. Every time I tell her that I'd like to hang out with a friend, she asks me "What are they?", meaning what ethnicity/race they are. That, I find to be extremely annoying, and it angers me too.      She actually listens to all the stereotypes of certain races doing bad things and being bad people, when it's not true. I have told her what I think about her racism in the most adult way I could. All she did was yell at me. I really do think she is very ignorant.      And also, the thing is we are Hispanic.      What do I do about this? I really do like being with my friends.

20090131141435AAcUBcI	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I help my friend?	I have a friend who frequently calls me in tears because of family troubles. From what I've heard, it seems that her parents often get angry over little things, and act like they don't like her, like she's a big disappointment to them. I'm sure that this isn't actually true, but I don't really know what to tell her. If she tries to talk to them about the problems, they just say she's making excuses. So I've told her many times to just try to strengthen her relationship with her parents. You know, that she should try to be more open with them, more cheerful, to really reach out to them. But she never takes my advice (probably the situation is just too tense). I want to help her, but sometimes it's just so frustrating that she never really tries to make things better. And in all seriousness, it's possible that her parents just don't have good personalities. But it's not like I can tell her that, because arguments aside, I know she loves them. Do I just keep being a listening ear? It's getting really hard because I spend hours trying to get her to stop crying, and I know she doesn't really LISTEN to my advice (she's told me I'm not exactly helpful, but that just listening to me talk helps her calm down). I'm worried and kind of frustrated with her.  What should I do?

We have been dating for a month and were taking it slow, getting to know each other. I have been getting anxiety because I feel that she is into me more than I am into her, and while we have been sexually intimate, I am starting to feel that I am maybe not that interested in her or need to slow down because its getting too fast too soon. She would like me to meet her friends and family and I get a "trapped" anxious feeling thinking about it. I dont want to hurt her and enjoy getting to know her slowly, but I think that I need to know for my own mental sake that I can see other women if I want to. What does that mean and should I tell her? How? I feel guilty and its killing me. I have not seen anyone else or fooled around with another girl since I started dating this girl for the past month but I have a hard time sleeping and feel so confused. Any advice?

This guy is one of my best friends, and I used to like him, then I THOUGHT that I didn't like him any more, but sometimes I would think "Maybe I do still like him and just don't realize it." These mixed feelings about him have been going on for a couple years. Then last night I had a dream about him. Here's what happened in the dream. We were sitting in my room looking through some of our old year books, and I made the comment that we were next to each other every year in the year books. He said something along the lines of "Maybe it was meant to be." I asked him what he meant by that, and he asked me if I liked him. Thinking he meant like a friend I said yes. Then he asked me "As more than a friend?" I asked him why and he told me that if I did, he was gonna ask me out, and I said yes. After that we started talking some more. Then he kissed me.      After I had that dream, I'm so confused and I don't know if I like him or not. I just need some advice, about what my dream might mean or just what. Thanks!

He works all day and then comes home and just wants to play games on his computer. On the weekends he wants to spend the majority of his time on the computer as well, but will take me to see a movie and out to dinner. But even this seems like he is just punching a time clock so he can get back to "doing his own thing." If we do spend time together during the week it is usually while watching TV and he gets so zoned out that I might as well not even be there. When I talk he pays attention for awhile but seems to quickly get bored. For example, I was talking to him in a parking lot and the next thing I know he is starring at a van pulling out of a space and totally ignoring me.      My boyfriend used to be really attentive and act like I was the most important thing in his life, but now he seems to do the minimum and gets more excited about video games and even hanging out with his sister than being with me.  He used to talk about our future but now he doesn't at all and when I bring it up he seems to have no interest. He says he only misses me "sometimes" or "a little bit."       He says he still loves me but it doesn't ring true in his actions. I think he loves me but it seems like he isn't IN love with me. The only time he seems to show any real excitement about our relationship these days is when sexual intimacy is involved. I'm trying to give him space and even suggested we take a break but he said he doesn't want to lose me. I'm so confused.       What should I do?

20090225090828AAnXUMs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Finding out how far along I am?	Ok. This whole time, I've been told that I am 8 wks pregnant and due Oct 6th.  I went to a nurse practitioner yesterday (I do not have insurance) and she gave me an exam to determine how far along I am. She told me that I am 5-6 wks!!  This was shocking to me.  She took my due date from Oct. 6th to Oct 20th!! I am even pretty positive I know when I conceived. Not to mention how long I've been sick and the amount of weight I've already gained.  Here are the dates:   First day of last period: 12/30/2008   Date of conception: either 1/10 or 1/11      Is is possible that she is wrong??? I hope to def. find out when I go to a steady doctor.      FYI: this is my second child, so I'm confindent that I know what the stages feel like.      Thank you for helping!!

20090225093736AAcZHAd	Family & Relationships;Family	Was I out of line or not ?	My big sister died on Monday she was in the hospital for three weeks dying there are 6 brothers and sisters including my sister that just died.She had three children ages 26,20 and 18  just a little history first she's been sick for awhile everyone knew at some point she would die.Now her children were horrible to her they neglected her and said really awful things to her that nobody should say to their dying mother.Myself my mother and all her siblings visited her in the hospital everyday sometimes she was aware that we were there  and then eventually she was unconscious.All of us never saw them visit their mother only maybe twice in three weeks and that's being generous it really think it was only once and by that time my sister was unconscious and didn't get to see them.They wouldn't return the hospital and doctors calls or the family neither nobody could get ahold of them while their mother was dying we left messages and they never once called us or the doctors back.So after talking to one of her doctors I called my nephew and left a message telling him doctors and all of us are trying to reach them and how important it is for them to call us I also said I was told they aren't visiting their mom I said how important it is for them to go daily to see her and how much she needs to see her children not one family member ever once saw them in the hospital and the doctors and nurses never even knew what they looked like was it wrong for me to leave that message on there phone.My nephew was hurt by my message and I feel I did nothing wrong.My sister has been dead since Monday and they still haven't called anyone even their grandma to plan the Funeral services so my mom and brother are doing it this is not normal behaviour even if they are mourning they are really hurting us all.

20070815022159AAU2Tkz	Family & Relationships;Family	Abuse and cutting?	When I was little, my dad was VERY verbally abusive, and he sometimes hit or pushed me too. My mom finally kicked him out when I was five, but I had already been told to never talk to him or interupt him, and if I did I was punished. I Iiterally never played or made any noise unless I wasn't in the house or if I was with my mom.      I didn't used to remember much of this, but now I do. Then I started getting the urge to cut myself (I'm 16). I gave in for a few days, but then I scared myself because I wanted to cut more and more and I wanted to see more blood. I called my best friend and confessed. Now whenever I feel like cutting, I call her and she talks me out of it.      Am I cutting because my suppressed memories of my father are coming back? Depression is very common in my family, too (my dad tried to kill himslef several times). Could I be depressed? I liked feeling powerful, but then I realized that the cutting was controlling me, not the other way around, so I stopped. Any ideas?

20090225092656AA4lSBo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: would you prefer to marry a girl who is has had one partner before or a virgin?	I'm just wondering. I slept with one boy when I was 24, but that was 4 yrs ago. I thought he loved me, but he apparently didn't and broke up with me after taking my virginity. So, I wonder if a Christian guy is going to judge me for having had sex just a handful of times in the past. What would you prefer a woman be at 28 yrs old...a complete virgin or at least have some experience with one partner?      P.S. I want to save sex for someone special in marriage, renew our vow to each other to show our pure love.

ANYWAY, we are getting married at our home, but on my invitations I putting:   Mr & Mrs {Parents of the bride}   Request the honor of your presence to the marriage of their daugther   {bride}   to {groom}   Then go into detail about the date, place time, ect...   My FH seems to think that his parents should be mentioned on the invitation...I have always thought it was whomever was hosting...In which case would be my parents as they are paying for a lot of it.   Was I wrong to not include them on the invite?  Mind you, his family thinks that WE should pay for his dads tux and moms dress...They both work full time and don't have a lot of bills.

20090225092246AAvsnt7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Lot of my friends say I'm judgemental, snobbish or think i'm better than them.?	Lately a lot of my friends have claimed i'm like this....      a couple of reasons could be because i'm at a comprehensive school with most people living there coming from poor backgrounds and me coming from a richer part of London but moving here. Also, they get ema for going to school which I don't agree with. But i don't argue with them or make a deal out of it, i just don't choose to get it myself. Like a vegetarian might not agree with meat eating and won't argue but just not eat meat.      Anyway, my friends have been calling me firstly snobbish for those reasons despite my family earning below minimum wage combined. Judgemental or that i think i'm better than them. But I am just a quiet person who's observant and prefers to listen to people's issues and life rather than talk. Just because I listen to them quietly doesn't mean I am judging them, i like helping them, nothing makes me happier than helping someone with issues.      And I don't think i'm better than them, I hate myself and am jealous of the lives they all have, they get to go out and do things I wish i could and all i can do is listen to them and be told what i'm missing out on.      I guess this was a rant but do you think they're the more judgemental ones, jumping to conclusions of what kind of person I am?

20090225093155AA6J1hu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When meeting a woman in a casual situation, how do you get that number?	I'm not a very shy person, and I frequently talk to people whenever I'm out and about.  I often find myself at the grocery store or the bookstore just chatting casually with someone.      Most usually, that person is an attractive woman that I thought I might like to chat with.  It's not hard to get the conversation started at all.        What IS hard is getting the number.  Especially in those short lived conversations, such as when you are standing in line for something.  Is it simply not appropriate to ask for a number when you've only been talking for two minutes?  If it's ok, then what's the best way to approach that question.  I always get stuck at that point, and usually end up walking away without much of a chance of ever meeting again.

Recently we've been IM each other and texting, and in one of the IM he revealed he was interseted in me, i thought about it and we arranged to meet up, but on the day he text me sayin he wasnt going to meet up because i was leading him on, i totally wasnt, so the next day he apologised and said listen we may like each other alot but if we got together it might ruin our friendship, and make university difficult. He's now hardly speaking to me and I feel so confused. Any advice?

We became very close friends way too fast & although I knew it was moving too fast, I somehow couldn't stop it. So finally after just 6 wks of talking non stop on the phone, going out shopping, etc. almost everyday & her coming over & me going over by her, the friendship came to a messy end!   She got upset when I had a dinner party with my husband's best friend & his gf & didn't invite her.   She deleted & blocked not only myself but my husband & my sister from her facebook & told me that she doesn't think we can be even be aquaintances anymore.    I agreed 'cause I'm not the sort to want too much drama in my life.   It's been 3 mths & now she's made contact with me asking me to get pass what happened between us & for us to be friends again.   I really don't want or need ppl in my life that are so complicated. It took me almost this long to get beyond everything that happened between us for her to suddenly decide she wants to be in my life again.   Am I being too harsh? Should I forgive & hope that this wouldn't happen again? My sister & mom thinks I should stay away from her but my husband, the forgiving sort :), thinks I should respond.
20090225093157AAdMYR9	Family & Relationships;Friends	My family and boyfriend don't get along...?	At first it was because of our 6 year age difference.  I was 18 and he was 24.  Now I'm 20 and he's 26.  He's in the military, from the south and I'm a student in college from up north.  My family has always not taken kindly to people different than them, they love to gossip and are very closed-minded.  When I met my boyfriend it was like a breath of fresh air!  I finally got to get away from the "i'm better than you" attitude.        Throughout our relationship, we've had many many ups and downs, mostly due to me being ready to commit and him wanting to break up.  Now his reasoning for breaking up hasn't been because he doesn't love me or want to be with me, but because in the past he's been in similar situations and the women cheat on him while he's deployed (for one he was only gone 3 months) and also because he feels the military lifestyle isn't one for the relationship we wish to have.  He's deploying in may for a year and after that we really don't know what the future holds for us.      The only people in my family who he gets along with are the ones who don't know our business.  My mom and older two sisters are the ones who have issues with him... Him and my mother have gotten in a few bad arguments, she's called him physically abusive (not true) and he's told her she's a "sorry excuse for a mom" (i wouldn't say exactly that but she has done pretty selfish things in regards to her kids) and he's not allowed at her house. but my mom and i don't get along because of things that have happened in our past so i'm not too bothered by that, but i'm very close to my oldest sister.  they feel that if he's 26 he should "get his sh** together and tell you what he wants", or that he's and idiot and immature for not committing after 2 years (which he actually has now).  They say i always sound unhappy when I call them about him, but the reason for that is i go to them for advice, and when i need help i'm usually in distress...why would i call them to tell them if he did something romantic for me?     I guess the biggest issue is i've opened up to them about us too much.  but it still bothers me that they won't give him a chance.

20090225093929AALnGur	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am a terrible spouse!?	I have lied, I have cheated, I am selfish....but I already know a lot of you are going to say that I don't love my husband...but I do and I want to know how to stop this reckless attitude and behavior before he is gone forever.  I go months trying to be a good spouse...cook, clean, love.  Sure everyday issues come up and sometimes we lose our tempers but when things get really stressful is when I seem to act the worst. I am tired of it.  I want to be a good wife.  Hubby knows about many of my indiscretions and has professed his love for me.  He says that I was young when he married me and that is why he has made allowances for my immaturity!  (he's only 3 yrs older but has led a very fast life)  HELP!!!
