0h9aD7Toaa	You probably have it that way because they were trying to make things work without upgrading the electrical service, just added a small box next to the main one for power, if they did it right it's fine, lots of them hooked up that way..<br>     They tapped in the main panel for power, went to the small fuse box next to main panel, then ran out to a/c unit, have to have disconect out there doesn't matter if 240v or 120, if hard wired with motor there has to be a disconect, in sight, within 50 feet, or they used to say if the main breaker was capable of being locked in the open position you didn't need it, but they don't go for that anymore.<br>     I like catching them on when they can use fuses or circut breakers for overcurrent protection for hvac equipment, one of the other or both???|`|bxlYleZkaa	You need one to protect the cable between power source and the unit itself.|`|b559897f55acb38836c292bcc5cf01afaa	It depends on where you are.

2Y2AFV7Kaa	Night storage uses cheap rate electricity to store heat then release it the following day .To maximise the cheap rate electric you have to use electricity overnight for things like washing machine dishwasher etc. When I was on the tariff cheap rate did not start till one o'clock in the morning also if you need additional heat or hot water then the electric you use is on a far higher tariff. Some of the energy saving websites should be able to help you work out what tariff would be best for you .but if you are home all day this is probably not the tariff for you,|`|AA11230878	Night storage is a system that works by electricity. Each unit is a container of brick like material that heats up, usually at night,on an off peak tariff. The only problem I found when I had that type of system was that you needed to know what the weather is going to be for the following day because once they are heated they start releasing the heat throughout the day. With Gas you have more control over the heating. Cost wise there is not much in it over the year.|`|98tUW1Y7aa	Chris W has most of the answers.

Have all the radiators been turned off as this would stop circulation.  Highly unlikely but check. The Overheat stat is positioned on the left hand side of the main heat exchanger.

ww12lItvaa	Nothing wrong with turning up the humidistat. But you will want to turn it down in the summer because moisture makes an air conditioner run more. <br>  <br>  You can add plants in the home to add humidity. All the water you put on them goes in to the house. A small indoor fountain is fun and will put water in the house too. <br>  <br>  Some people in the past liked to keep a kettle warming on the stove to add humidity. But you have to watch it to keep it from going dry. I have a very large camp "kettle" that holds a gallon I put on the wood stove in the basement when I am using that.   <br>  <br>  But I would also check for drafts and air leaks in the house. Heating is drying as any outside air that enters the home, when heated, drops in "relative" humidity.  Humidity is called "relative" because it is relative to temperature.  <br>  <br>  So if you have such low humidity you likely have air leaks as most homes these days are sealed up so well they tend to be too humid even when heated. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Ideal humidity is 40 to 50%. More than 50% and you will take the chance of breeding mold. Under 40% and your nose will dry up and itch, wood furniture will shrink and crack and static electricity will will develop on hardwood and carpeted areas. Turn the humidity up slowly since you want to stop when it is at the ideal level.|`|ZKUukv55aa	Most humidstats have a temp reference.Set it for the temp outside. What kind of humidifier do you have? If you have a water reservoir get rid of and have some install a water fall. You can also install a portable one in your bed room and change the water every day.|`|bzE5hH8Maa	Crank it up   thats what its there for!!!|`|jsJhFW1Kaa	Humidity levels can take quite a while to change dramatically. Many house materials absorb moisture, so it's quite possible that you have to let them reach equilibrium before you will notice a difference. How long you wait depends on lots of factors, but I'd leave a particular setting for a week or so before increasing it. Also, I wouldn't increase more than 5% at a time. You want to sneak up on minimum level that makes you feel comfortable. Too much humidity in the house, particularly in the winter, can lead to other health problems and will also result in excessive amounts of moisture forming on the inside of your windows. <br>  <br>  How to Add a Humidifier<br>  <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/video/0,,20052871,00.html?xid=yahoo-answers&partner=yes" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/video/0,...</a>

It does not take very long to heat up the house.

8apA3Rffaa	You say step , but I assume you mean the shower curb.  I don t level the 2x4 s that I set for the curb. After I set the membrane and cement board the walls and cement board the top of the 2x4. You must use at least 3 laying flat/ w/ the bottom 1 being a treated 2x4. I then use good edged pcs of cement board out side and inside, leveling those up and also making a slight pitch to the inner part of the shower.I fill and let dry w/ thin set , creating a level surface w/ a slight pitch to the inside to have water drain back. Then and MOST important, I use a water proofing compound so water proof and seal all horizontal surfaces at this time, such as seats and inset shelves , anywhere where water can set so it won t go thru and start rotting something.<br>    This whole system isn t usually a 1st timer type job , since after all this is dine you must put in a cement shower floor and make it level and w/ the proper pitch to the drain.  Any detailed questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and see my qualifications there  GL|`|kIblsxJQaa	havent got a clue but good luck|`|mP0LLMVjaa	You will need a rubber membrane to go between 2 mortar beds and make it slope towards the drain. It is then difficult to tile and you can only use small tiles. This is quite a job for a first time do it yourselfer.I would get a preformed shower base that you set on a bed of mortar and level the base and then tile over that.<br>  <a href="http://www.tileredi.com/?gclid=CISq8aPx65gCFQxKGgodPAg-1Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.tileredi.com/?gclid=CISq8aPx6...</a><br>  I gutted a bathroom and replaced a 1 piece fiberglass tub/shower with a Swanstone retrofit acrylic shower floor on top of a bed of mortar and changing 1 1/2" drain to a 2" drain.<br>  <a href="http://www.swanstoneproducts.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=SP&Category_Code=SWFN" rel="nofollow">http://www.swanstoneproducts.com/Merchan...</a><br>  I ordered mine through Home Depot and it was much cheaper.|`|uV54p794aa	The floor in a shower isnt supposed to be level, it's supposed to slope towards the drain, otherwise you run the risk of standing water in the shower.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	i would level it you could use something easier than concrete .like a hard grout would be able to work with it more easily|`|AA11758925	If your laying it on concrete i dont understand why you would need 2x4's? im guessing to build the step up. As far as laying the tile you can buy quickset at home depot which dries in 15 minutes, basically build and make sure its covered under the whole tile untill you level it out how you want it, as you push down on it some mortar will come out the cracks but give it a few minutes and wash gently with a wet rag, it will leave a haze of course but once dried you can clean it up easy. when laying the shower flower make sure you have a slope- maybe get a leveler that goes toward the drain, this will stop puddles of water. Last thing you wanna do is get Good grout, not the cheap stuff they sell in the store no matter what they tell you. Lowes sells a 2 step epoxy grout where you choose the color and it dries like concrete, this will help you from getting effervesence in the months ahead<br>  if you do use 2x4's for the step make sure you lay backer board on top op it, this will help the tile from cracking in future. But as i read in another post you will need a shower pan or waterproof membrane just in case water does leak thru it goes in the drain and not outside the shower floor|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	If you floor is out of level its for a reason if its smooth and sloping to your drain that what it needs.

It's tricky, and often, not worth the bother.|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Above is correct, this is the normal leaf color.  You plant is growing!  The red color on the bract.......yeah the leaf gets a new name, bract when it changes color is not the true flower.  You've seen the little nubbin' on the top, like little balls, those are the leaves.  <br>  <br>  The terminal leaves begin to color when nights reach their maximum length in winter.  This also triggers the development of the flowers.  Right now you want your plant to begin the green growing process, vegetative growth.  Come next winter if you have 12-14 hours complete darkness and 10-12 hours light the plant will start to change the terminal growth and flowers develop.   <br>  <br>  Carrying a plant from year to year is difficult unless you live in a semi tropical part of the country.  If you fail, you are in company with 95% of all others who have tried.

One way is to have professionals come out and fix the walls floors etc.  You obviously have a structure that was not built correctly or has sustained damage which allows water to come in.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  The other suggestion I have is to check the ventilation areas and the door.  The door should be solid and one piece(no cracks, holes, rust)  If this is an outdoor cellar, then you need to look inside for visible cracks.  That is the first sign of structural damage.  The other method is having a floor drain added to it that runs to your sewer or septic.  I have actually seen this done before.  Either way is not cheap.|`|lBRud4y5aa	As said an automatic sump pump will get rid of water on the floor once you have a floor that drains into a pit.

Do basically two things at once - 1 stop the leaks, and 2 reroute the water flow from your gutters. I bought a house that had a leaky basement and I have converted it into office space. First, if it seems to leak mostly when it rains hard you should extend the downspouts on your house so that they don't dump water right around the edge of your house. That is the likely source of your leaks. Then second, get two products from Lowe's or Home Depot, you need fast-setting hydraulic cement and a waterproofing masonry paint, I like the Drylok brand. Where ever you know leaks are coming in use the hydraulic concrete to patch those leaks, wear gloves when working with it or you will get skin burns. Let the cement cure for a week, then paint all the concrete walls in the basement with two coats of Drylok and especially paint at the corners and where the concrete wall meets the concrete floor. After this dries you should be leak free. Between moving the drain water away from the foundations and leak stopping the basement we haven't had a leak since we did that. If you are going to put down laminate flooring or wood flooring you still should use a plastic sheet barrier under the flooring so that trace amounts of moisture doesn't damage the flooring.|`|AA10958746	Duck Tape....or is it Duct Tape?

Gzk1TQFAaa	Use detergent with whitening (not bleach).  Wash jacket with towels to balance the load.  Make sure the dryer heat setting is on low or the jacket will yellow.  I ruined a white down coat from a too hot dryer.  Good luck.|`|AA10923010	I would use something like dreft
m5OXGrREaa	Light the fire with dry kindling and build up with dry wood. The flu needs to be warm and drawing before trying for a large fire using damp logs. If you are using a smokeless fuel then check if the flu damper is open wide [if one is fitted] or failing that the flu may be partially blocked. A newly opened fireplace sometimes needs a couple of fires in it before it settles down.|`|AA11988604	more likely that the damper is closed.  be sure to test it each time you light a fire by twisting a sheet of newsprint and lighting the end of it and holding it near the top of the fire box.  the flame and smoke should go up the chimney and not into the room if the damper is open.  sometimes you have to heat the chimney a bit in this way to establish a draft if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction outside.|`|5esm3e1Baa	Most likely, although wood from some trees does produce more smoke.<br>  <br>  You need to store the wood outside in a dry place so that it releases any dampness.  Only bring what you need into the house.<br>  <br>  Check the grate on the fire is open in the correct position, and use sparing amounts of tinder/firelighters.  Build your fire using a layer of newspaper, then small logs, a couple of firelighters, and add a couple of dry larger logs on top.  Once the fire is going fully, you can then add additional logs as required.

Your furniture will gain a softer appearence than it would from the brown because the orange provides less value contrast(contrast between light and dark)<br>  <br>  So whether you like modern chic, or that good ol comfy feeling, these are two colors that will compliment your furniture the most!|`|C9rnqAcQaa	Probably a nice lemon yellow would look really good on the walls!<br>  If you have any luck please show me what it looks like after you have painted it?!|`|AA12233727	White, cream, beige, or gray.

jsJhFW1Kaa	The solution is to replace the diverter, the knob on the top of the tub spout, but to do that you have to replace the entire tub spout. Sounds drastic but it isn't difficult or expensive. You can get new tub spouts at home centers and hardware stores.<br>  <br>  Before you buy a new tub spout, however, you have to determine how the spout is attached. Some thread on, some are friction fit. Here's how to tell the difference and how to make the repair:<br>  <br>  Replacing a Leaky Shower Diverter<br>  <a href="http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/asktoh/question/0,,1610794,00.html?xid=yahoo-answers&partner=yes" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/asktoh/q...</a><br>  <br>  I followed these instructions to replace a leaky diverter at my house. No problem.|`|RMazmrLGaa	Some of the manifolds have plugs that can be plugged or not depending on the Shower or tub/shower application.  Easiest would be to just replace the whole manifold.   If not an option, buy a plug and insert it into the underside of the manifold where the pipe to the tub-filler is...|`|ywPmdbSXaa	Did you try pulling it up and pushing it down a couple of times? Also try moving it side to side, front to back. It's possible it's just wore out and has to be replaced. Always push it down when you are done, then shut the water off, not the other way around.|`|qrBTTEwIaa	Hes talking about changing the spout. Sometimes it unscrews and sometimes it twist off in the wall. just be easy on it. good luck|`|3CSoSRmtaa	It seems there's a piece broke inside the faucet.|`|AA11988604	easiest thing to do is replace the faucet.  they are just attached to a threaded pipe.  take a wrench handle and stick it in the faucet and turn counter clockwise and it should spin off.  either repair the existing faucet if you can, or get a replacement.  be sure to put some teflon tape on the threads of the pipe before you spin it back on|`|5aJ7t4hJaa	You have several good answers already. *I* believe that the fault lies in your faucet spout assembly that is designed to switch the flow of water from your bathtub to your overhead shower. That spout assembly should be easily backed out by using a wrench of the right size to fit the existing spout and turning, 'bumping' gently-but-firmly at first, *counter-clockwise* -- to the *left side*, facing the top of the turn -- until the old spout is removed.  If the short piping nipple from the piping hot water/cold water manifold should happen to come out *with* the old spout, your plumbing job will be increased a bit by 'checking out the condition of the old nipple' to decide whether to just clean out the "rust crud" and paint the threads with new sealant.<br>  <br>  If *YOU* are not familiar with and at ease in tackling plumbing jobs, AND if you don't have a *good friend* who *IS* -- then *I* would advise you to buy a new bathtub water outlet spout having the feature of "switching" from tub-filling to overhead shower-spray; and call in a *recommended*, certified plumber who will do a "guaranteed" good job for you.
fGXHrD3xaa	The only time a drain cleaner will work is if the clog is in the trap and if that's the case use a plunger. If you have copper,cast iron or galvanized pipes DO NOT use drain cleaner as it will eat through the pipe a plunger and snake will fix any problem.

721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	It really is about keeping the comforter clean. My whole family hates top sheets. We never use them. All they really do for you is get twisted in a bunch if you squirm at night. I swore off dry clean only comforters and duvets and just wash my comforters as often as you would sheets. I used to think it was weird not to use a top sheet and I was constantly pulling the top sheets out from behind the beds and putting them on the bed for my kids and they would just try to hide them again. I think that it's because they squirm a lot and didn't like getting twisted up in them. At some point I realized it was a loosing battle and just quit putting them on the beds at all. Somewhere down the line I tried sleeping without one and have hated top sheets ever since. I will make the guest bed with a top sheet before we have company because I realize that most people are accustomed to sleeping with them.|`|acj9mB9Paa	Sheets just help keep the comforter clean for longer by keeping the body oils off of the comforter.  You can also use a duvet cover to cover your comforter (which is wat I prefer) instead of a sheet.  This is a popular option with people who use down comforters.|`|AA10923010	Agrees with the above answer. Why dirty the comforter when it is easier to was a sheet.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Its certainly not normal.  The top sheet is washable and definitely less expensive that cleaning a comforter.  Sheets are changed once a week and washed.  If your comforter is not, you aren't sleeping in a clean environment.  If you would prefer to use a duvet cover over the comforter which could be washed each week that would be preferable to sleeping under something that is just collecting dead cells and dust.  It's just not healthy to sleep without a top sheet or a duvet cover.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	Not really. It's much easier to wash a sheet than to clean a comforter. That's why people use top sheets. Sheets are much cheaper than comforters, so why dirty up and wear out a comforter?
ww12lItvaa	That is the start relay failing to start the compressor. It is tripping on the overload, clicking off when the compressor won't start. <br>  <br>   Either the relay is bad or the compressor is shot. <br>  <br>  Not likely a refrigerant problem. The compressor can run just fine on low refrigerant, there is no low pressure switch as mentioned in the other post.  <br>  <br>  As a tech I would put a start box on it and that way know if it was a bad compressor but that might cost you more than it is worth unless it is a rather expensive one.<br>  <br>  Odds are it is shot. You might try a new relay but those aren't cheap either.|`|QC2NozBkaa	It may have lost it's charge of refrigerant.  There is a shut off to prevent the compressor from coming on if the pressure is low to keep from sucking outside air into the system.  I could be wrong but have an ac guy check it.

How big depends on how much time before the move. Each person fills that rough tote with stuff they need until the very end.

Maybe set them aside, and when that room is emptied of everything else, it can be unpacked and you can use those things until the last minute. These are also the last on the truck, first off when you get to the new house. How convenient!<br>  <br>  First round of packing:<br>  Out of season things, maybe they are already sort of packed. Decorative things. Backup supplies of things like spare towels and linens. Pack everything that isn't currently in circulation.<br>  <br>  In between is furniture, clothing, etc. Storage pieces should be full of the stuff you always keep in it, but wrap the items as needed.<br>  <br>  Last is cleaning supplies and tools, and your essentials boxes for each person, the house, and the kitchen.<br>  <br>  Don't pack any food, it may seem expensive but it will take valuable space in your moving truck. Eat from your pantry shopping as little as possible, using things up, getting creative with menu combinations. Then toss opened food and donate the rest the day you leave.
p7AT6tDsaa	I like the fridge packs from arm and hammer.  The simply rip the panel off.  The traditional way however is to open the top no more than 1 inch by 1inch.  The backing soda then is free to absorb odors.  You must however use the whole box.  I really like the big bags from Sam's or other large retailers for cleaning laundry and taking odors out of your washing machine.  If you have an odor on a surface you mix it with water to a pasty form and apply.  Let it dry then sweep it up.  That will normally do the trick.  In plastic items you usually have to make a slurry solution and soak them in it.  Hope that I was able to sufficiently answer your question.  Have a great day.|`|AA10622097	For the refrigerator, just open the top of the box and put it inside, it neutralizes the odor. For cleaning other appliances, look on the box, there should be directions on making a cleaning solution by mixing with water.

vEsSIGfYaa	Propane, a liquefied petroleum gas [LPG] is always under pressure to keep it liquefied.  That pressure can go up to over 250 Psi [pounds per square inch], and even higher under really adverse conditions.<br>  <br>  If the corrosion protection [paint] coating fails, then the metal of the tank can rust, and as the rust penetrates, the tank shell can be weakened to the point of failure, releasing explosive gas to the atmosphere.  Also, depending on the conditions of rust penetration, another result could be a mechanical explosion.<br>  <br>  To prevent this all codes relating to LPG REQUIRE adequate corrosion protection [paint], OR the LPG delivery driver is PROHIBITED from adding LPG to the tank.  State laws regarding licensing of LPG drivers requires them to be trained in inspection of tanks before filling, and to not deliver product if the tank fails to meet safety standards.<br>  <br>  Therefore your tank NEEDS to be PAINTED properly.<br>  <br>  As to who is responsible, the previous answers correctly indicate that IF the tank belongs to you, then you are responsible.  On the other hand, IF the tank belongs to the LPG service, then they are responsible for painting the tank.|`|aEadwhXQaa	You probably own the tank and the people who fill it have to be certain that the tank is in good condition before filling it.  Think what would happen if they fail in advising owners about needed maintenance.  <br>  <br>  There may be some fine print in your contract for delivery that explains all this.|`|TwA5TIcGaa	If you do not own the tank, then it is the companies responsibility to paint it.|`|0h9aD7Toaa	If you own it you paint it, if they own it they paint it|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	My LP filler-guy said I could paint the tank (a large rented one) but make sure to use a very light color; darker colors absorb more heat, raising the pressure, and in high altitudes can cause the safety release to activate.

NCZK0QyGaa	Since you're in the basement you may find bugs no matter how clean it is.  I would recommend that you occasionally fumigate your room.  They sell bug bombs most places including grocery stores in the cleaning aisle.  The instructions are on the package but basically you make sure the basement is enclosed then put the bug bombs in the middle of each room and press the button.  After you wait a few hours for the spray to kill the bugs you start ventilating the room to get all the toxins out.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	I use a product called Tempo it kills all kinds of bug even the exterminators use it.<br>  I get it at IFA.

Those are called hosue centipedes. They go to your room because of changing weather (for the most part). They aren't attracted by food or anything, they just want shelter. Make sure your room is clear of clutter and junk. Other than that, you may need to call an exterminator, to spray the outside permiter.|`|O1G31WMPaa	GET AN EXTERMINATOR IF YOU ARE THAT FREAKED OUT.  DO NOT USE ORKIN.  MAKE SURE THEY OFFER YOU A ONE YEAR GUARANTEE.|`|pd7WGdl6aa	To keep the bugs away, an easy home remedy is :<br>  <br>  throw cloves around your room! Just whole cloves; place some in corners, under the desk, in your garbage can, anywhere you feel its damp etc. Remember where you threw them, and replace them every once in a while (every other week or so). Bugs don't like the smell of cloves and don't come near it. That's how I store all my stuff in storage; it's laced with cloves. Of course, I don't mind the smell of cloves and think they smell nice, so you need to first see if you are okay with it. <br>  <br>  Another thing is that since you have a basement suite, there might be corners here and there that are damp (like where the wall passes the ground), so make sure those are dry.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you have any holes/small spots where bugs can get it, tape them shut with clear tape, sticky side away from you towards the bugs. That way, you will be aware if anything is trying to get in, and bugs won't try to come it since they will try and get away from the sticky thing.<br>  <br>  Or, go the ultimate way and get pest cleaning done. <br>  <br>  Bugs also come when your room is dusty. So your room might be super clean, but I would recommend dusting everyday. It really helps stops the breeding if they are ever inside.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	If you're not a clutterbug, I would just suggest to make sure you get those seal-tight weather strips to go around your doors/windows.  Caulk around any areas of home that may have loose airway for bugs to get in.  Have screens for your windows & try to keep doors shut as often as possible around the corners of your home.  Citrus sprays are used to keep animals from being in certain places in the home.  It may work for bugs as well.  Good Luck|`|AQ0qVeR0aa	Your basement bedroom is probably too humid.

If the landlord is really cheesy get them to purchase the supplies and you do the work.

83b9c11562d344b8e4284f71b30ebb2caa	Some Limes don't self-pollinate as easily as others, or just won't, though some retail plants are sold as 2 different plants, grafted onto 1 root stock plant.  <br>  <br>  As has been mentioned, Citrus plants benefit from specialist citrus fertiliser, as these contain the right blend of all the micro-nutrients that citrus plants need in order to grow well.  Likewise, if you re-pot it, you can get a special potting soil/compost tailored for citrus fruits - this will help as you go forward, but I'm assuming that you don't need to re-pot for some time, but is worth remembering for future.<br>  <br>  Avoid excesses of temperature changes,  as this can stress Limes, causing them to have leaf fall, as well as fruit drop.  If you have no insects around to pollinate your plant, then you could use a small paintbrush to transfer pollen between flowers.   Although some Lime plants produce seedless fruits, they still need to be pollinated in order for fruit to set.  Keep the air around your plant reasonably humid, which you can do by standing your plant on some gravel with water below it - ie. don't let the plant's roots sit in water.   You could also mist occasionally,  and this sometimes encourages fruit to set, but won't raise the overall humidity as much as a dish of water nearby, that will evaporate constantly.<br>  <br>  You can allow your plant to start to dry out between waterings, which should ensure that the soil/compost is almost evenly moist, and I'd feed every 2 to 3 weeks during flowering and fruit growth.  Aim to get at least 10 hours of good light on your plant each day,  which can be supplemented with artificial lighting.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that you've had your plant for some time, and that it's generally happy with its position, and is healthy, so you've probably little to do to ensure that its position is optimum.  Air flow around them is good, but I avoid drafts with my plants.<br>  <br>  Your plant, if grown inside, could also be hardened-off, to allow it to grow well outdoors, during the summer months.  Gradually transition it from indoors to out by giving it a couple of hours outdoors a day, increasing this amount slowly over 2 or 3 weeks, when the weather conditions are right.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck! Rob|`|jOljnsulaa	Garden centres will sell citrus fruit food.

LFYr9iH0aa	You don't say if you have a vented system or combi boiler.<br>  <br>  The shower you described is the one for sitting in the bath to wash your hair. As you raise the shower head, the pressure is not sufficient which highlights the need for the cold water tank in the loft to be raised as the shower is gravity fed.

OwCUYWeUaa	Usually it can be adjusted.  If it is a newer furnace with a control board, then there are dip switches on the board that control the blower on/off delays.  You would need to check the owners manual to determine witch switches need to be changed.  If it has an older style mechanical fan/limit control, than that can be kind of tricky.  If not done right you can damage the mechanism.  If you have that kind of control then call a heating guy to check it out.
966c91231592132e98c766b9abba712eaa	Probably the steam heat from the press.  <br>    <br>  My first thought is that the pressing methods are <br>  causing them to stretch.  Because wool shrinks in <br>  many cleaning processes, they tend to stretch them <br>  a bit in the final press.  <br>    <br>  But you write that they stretch polyester as well, and <br>  that suggests that the cleaner is  somehow at fault.  <br>  Again, it would almost take high temperature steam <br>  to cause the fibers to relax enough to stretch during <br>  ironing.  It is normal for wool pants to stretch a little <br>  during dry cleaning because of the steam press, but <br>  not to continually getting bigger.  To much stretching <br>  from steam heat will break down the fabric.<br>    <br>  I would take the clothes in question back to the cleaners <br>  and ask them to either make them right, or replace <br>  them.   <br>    <br>  If they do not make the clothes right, I would change <br>  dry cleaners.

Look if you have the necessary<br>  tools available. <br>  Fill a bucket or dishpan with warm water and add a small amount of<br>  the detergent of your choice. <br>  Remove any windscreens if you have any that are hanging against the<br>  window.<br>  To clean them: lift them out of their tracks and rub them<br>  together under a running hose, rub them very gently with a rag or<br>  window wand, or brush them off. Why clean the screens? You'll<br>  remove some of the dust that the next rainstorm will knock onto your<br>  windows. <br>  You'll also get rid of that stale window screen smell. <br>  Remove any cobwebs you might see with an old broom or old cloth. <br>  Remove any excessive dirt or dust from the outside windows with a<br>  garden hose. <br>  Rinse only one window at a time, so that water spots<br>  don't dry on the windows. <br>  Clean the window frame thoroughly with your soaked sponge. <br>  Soak your sponge in the bucket with water and you can start cleaning<br>  your windows following one of these methods: <br>  Start on the left upper side corner from the window and make an s-shape downwards the window until you end in on the right downside of the window.<br>  Start cleaning the window from the left upper side corner and go with a straight vertical line down. Use a chamois or dry rag to remove any excessive water from the squeegee and start cleaning the next line until you reach the right side of the window. <br>  Don't forget to dry your squeegee with a chamois or dry rag after each stroke your made. Otherwise you will have visible lines on the window pane. <br>  Dry the window frame. After cleaning the window pane, dry off the window using a chamois or dry cloth. <br>  <br>  Alternative method:<br>  <br>  Get a bucket of warm water. Warm water is able to remove grime and<br>  grit better than cold water, but hot water may make the window crack<br>  if it is cold out. <br>  Get a bottle of rubbing alcohol. The alcohol is the effective cleanser<br>  in cleaning the window. Isopropyl rubbing alcohol is the right kind to<br>  use. Do not use wine or any other substance containing other<br>  alcohols, or otherwise Isopropyl not by itself. <br>  Collect paper towels. You want to create as little lint as possible, so<br>  use lint-free paper towels (or even toilet paper, if you don't have any) <br>  Pour ? of the alcohol into the water. <br>  Allow to soak for one minute. <br>  Shake the alcohol to mix with the water. <br>  Dip half of the towel into the bucket. <br>  Wipe the window in straight and vertical lines. <br>  Dry with another paper towel, drying in the same way as you cleaned. <br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>  It is well worth investing in a good-quality, professional squeegee. A few extra dollars up front will save plenty of time and frustration. Measure your smallest window and get the widest blade that will fit in it. <br>  If there are little drops left around the edges after squeegeeing, lift them gently with a dry, lint-free cloth or clean finger, but don't rub them around over the freshly-cleaned area. If they're very close to the edges, it may be best just to ignore them. <br>  Do not squeegee a window in direct sunlight, or it will leave streaks. <br>  Wash the insides of windows first. The outsides will dirty your tools and water much faster. <br>  Use glass cleaner only for panes too small for the squeegee, delicate objects, and small touch-up cleaning. <br>  Clean, unused newspapers can also be utilized. Just wash the glass as stated above, then use a crumpled-up sheet of newspaper to wipe the glass until it's dry. If the sheet of paper becomes too wet, just use another sheet until the glass is dry. This method will avoid streaking too. Wear rubber gloves if you wish to avoid newsprint on your hands. <br>  Remember that there is a wet and a dry side to a squeegee. If water is streaking from the top of the squeegee, simply apply a little pressure to the side of the squeegee that is streaking. It helps to wipe the squeegee off from time to time, also. <br>  Try using an angled attempt to your squeegee motion. <br>  Practice makes perfect. <br>  When cleaning windows inside a house, put down an old towel underneath the window to catch drips. <br>  <br>  Warnings:<br>  <br>  Whenever possible, use an extension handle to reach high windows with your feet on the ground. Also, find out if the window panels lift out or fold in for cleaning. If you must use a ladder, use it safely and take care not to overreach.|`|pDcrfhm8aa	On this side of the pond we have stuff called Joy or Dawn. Mixed with water, it provides lubrication between the window and the squeegee rubber as it emulsifies the dirt and helps contain both the dirt and the solution when it's cut off the window with one stroke of the sharp rubber. Used primarily to clean flatware and china, it's well renowned for it's economy in the kitchen. Unlike the news print or paper towel that hold both the dirt and solution only to smear after repeated use, it has other uses in the garden, laundry or garage.

jWtquDVUaa	Hello, if this is a freezer only, then it is hopefully a manual defrost. They do make auto defrost units but not suggested for long term freezing, as your food thaws and refreezes often. So they are only recommended for short term freezing like your refrigerator/freezer. But anyway just turn it off open the doors, (don't use anything like a butter knife of ice pick) no matter how tempted! You can if you want to rush it a little, use a hair dryer. But then just wipe it all down and clean it in good shape.|`|04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	You don't need a manual to defrost your freezer.

There is a "flapper" seal at the outlet of the duct from the 'range' exhaust blower to the outside air, and if that "flapper" becomes  "gummed-up" so as not to be able to freely drop into a *closed* position *whenever the exhaust blower is NOT running*, the outside air -- cold or hot -- can re-enter the kitchen!|`|PKha8D7oaa	I agree with all of the answers previously listed. But you said you put blankets around the vent and that helped so that leads me to believe its not just the vent itself but the seal around it. I would check and make sure there is a damper and make sure its not getting stuck open. You should be able to buy a damper from Lowe's or Home Depot if one is not present. I would also recommend spraying some foam insulation around the vent and try that. Hope this helps.|`|y31mee4Faa	Although an HVAC tech might check it out for you, it's not an HVAC problem.<br>  <br>  Usually downdraft ranges are simply vented into crawl spaces under a house, without any damping against drafts.<br>  <br>  Hubby could put a damper on the end of the vent pipe to help keeping the air out, but without putting a cap on it or closing the vent, it's the nature of the beast.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck...

cbRc11zQaa	That's a pretty small area for trees and bushes. You could plant maybe one tree and a few hedge-type privacy shrubs in an area that size.<br>  There's a downside to trees that grow exceptionally fast; willows (which would thrive in an area near water), poplars, elms, maples, that you should be aware of before planting. All of the fast growing trees that I know of are either soft-wooded or notorious "litterbugs". They litter the ground with seeds and debris, such as twigs that break-off in the slightest windy conditions or the gutter-clogging maple samaras (helicopters). Not necessarily cause to rule them out, just a factor to consider before planting.<br>  Maybe a smaller "specimen tree" in the area with branches and leaves that would offer eye level privacy would be good; river birch (grows well when planted near water) or any ornamental fruit tree, such as flowering plum, crabapple, etc. (they do have flowers for a week or two in Spring, but not a big factor as far as attracting bees all season long). <br>  Shrub and tree selection would depend on whether the area is sunny or shaded, or somewhere in between. Keep in mind that if you want fast growing shrubs and also want them low in height, it will require considerable trimming at least twice during each growing season. Some fast-growing evergreen shrubs to consider would be yews, hemlocks or arborvitaes. Slower-growing evergreens which will require less maintenance over the years include dwarf Alberta spruce and a few broadleaf evergreens, such as boxwoods, hollys and euonymus.<br>  If you don't mind shrubs that shed their foliage in Fall, forsythia, burning bush, spirea, dogwood, golden vicary (golden privet) or barberry bushes are all fairly fast-growing.|`|9NSQXXUoaa	Try calling a nearby florist and they hopefully answer your questions.

Wrong setting on the vacuum for the surface. <br>  Much of this can be avoided with proper instruction from a sales rep or somebody like me who messes with everything. But when consumers see this on a shelf at the Costco, Sam's Club or Sears they only see the PR that's written on a pop display and figure that's all there is to it.<br>   <br>  Lesson I Find out how to get the beater bar assembly apart and change the belt. It's in the manual or on the box usually. But if there's ladies, dogs, and big hair metal heads from the 80's around, there is going to be shedding. (I'm not talking asbout the Hair Club dropouts and Bichon owners that don't have girlfriends.) If hair isn't tangled up in the beater bar the belt will move it better.<br>  Lesson II Listen to the pitch of the motor as you run it. It the business end is stuck to the floor, there is no air movement and the pitch of the motor is high. Raise the level up untill the brushes just make contact without making a seal to the floor. If there is a clog inside the vacuum the motor will wind out too and it's time to get the hanger out while you take it apart for cleaning. Some time a broom and shovel should be used on the floor first cause these things weren't intended to suck up wood chips, shell husks from the aviary, small toys from the playroom or scrap pot metal from the garage floor. Mount a 2 x 4 on a broomstick and use a dustpan first before wasting time, tools and temper on Royal Kirby.<br>  Lesson III Most machines are fixable. Though most modern vacuums have brass bushings instead of ball bearings. they are pretty tough and resilient. If the shaft of the motor doesn't wiggle much and turns some, it's likely the blades have sheared off due to the unit sucking on something it shouldn't. The Blades cost less than $5.00 (3.5 GBH). Belts are on displays at the supermarket. As are the bags. Believe it or not, these things work real good when they're not full. Clean and dry sponge filters once in a while if your unit has them. Unless you can buy new cars when the ashtrays are filled up or you have paper for body parts, let use the nut between our shoulders here. <br>  Lesson IV Match the tool for the job. If you're going across bare floor the brush is just going to knock stuff around. An electric broom does fine. If you have shag or sculpted pile carpets you need something to beat and comb the snot without an aerobic workout. Most vacuums have tools available for purchase if they don't come with them. The better models will hook up to or power sanders, drills and all sorts of things. <br>  All said, they all do okay for what they are intended. Uprights are rated in Amps and canisters are rated in HP. But given a little thought to how you are going to use it and knowing how to maintain it, a vacuum will last for twenty years or more.|`|odpT2TBuaa	Ohh try a Dyson most people use them : <a href="http://www.buycheapnow.co.uk/dyson-dc19-cylinder-vacuum-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buycheapnow.co.uk/dyson-dc19-...</a>|`|AA10923010	I vote for a Kirby also, but a Kirby does much more than a vacuum and cost more too.|`|EjveULVNaa	l have owned red devil- hoover.etc etc the one l have know is oreck you cant go wrong expensive but you get your moneys worth|`|lFrJ6hqNaa	try a henry most firms use them
5iH5FXLsaa	they probably will|`|AA11946812	Most likely, yes.  It might show up as black and grey, which could be nice, actually.|`|Rn7Kjwdxaa	Like MW says you should certainly try to bleach it first to get the blue as light as possible.  Then dye it and see how it looks.  To get the best black with the least contrast in the two stripes you may have to dye it black for a second time.  Look at it after the first dyeing though, you might like it ok.|`|WwP6XzWuaa	Most likely it will dye in stripes of black and grey. this could be nice, but if you want a straight black dress i would recommend using bleach to get the blue as light as you can before you dye it. make sure you are using the correct amount of bleach to avoid damaging your dress.|`|LVsE65jiaa	it might. they have stuff in the laundry section called rit i think and they have dyes for clothes in that brand also but anyways they have this stuff that will remove color from clothes and make it pretty much all the same color. i would try that first to see if that would help.
