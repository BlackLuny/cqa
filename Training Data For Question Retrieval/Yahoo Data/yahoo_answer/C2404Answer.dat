In my opinion you should always trust (give the benefit of the doubt) someone until they give you a reason not too. Maybe be selective with what you trust them with until they prove to be trustworthy.    That's not nessecarily not trusting but just being careful about it.    I think most people in general are good people. People just have different values and ways of going about things. For example, if you tell someone something that you don't want mentioned to anyone else, but you did not explain that to them and they told, then is it fair not to trust them? Maybe to them it was not that big of a deal, when it was to you. But how are they to know when you did not tell them that in the first place? See, different viewpoints and ways of thinking.    Now there are very untrustworthy people in the world and I think that's were your own personal judgement needs to come in. That's why starting out with "small trust" helps you discover that flaw before reveling anything "big" to them. Then if you do confide in them and they blab all, you honestly should have known better. :)|`|7fdcd76738d2afbc3ff09cd9c935148baa	You have to trust, too find one is untrustworthy.|`|a1ade5da42c42c9d015da17955c5fd0eaa	that cool|`|x5w3Bdbnaa	im not sure it is better not to trust in anyONE... if you dont trust anyone you really cant expect them to trust you...

pI5jKfmaaa	Read the few pages from the link and complete your project successfully.Best of luck !    Colonial era    Unlike much of Africa, the fate of Rwanda and the Great Lakes region was not decided by the 1884 Berlin Conference. Rather the region was divided in an 1890 conference in Brussels. This gave Rwanda and Burundi to the German Empire as colonial spheres of interest in exchange, renouncing all claims on Uganda in exchange for being given the island of Heligoland. The poor maps referenced in these agreements left Belgium with a claim on the western half of the country, and after several border skirmishes the final borders of the colony were not established until 1900. These borders contained the kingdom of Rwanda as well as a group of smaller kingdoms on the shore of Lake Victoria.    In 1894 Rutarindwa inherited the kingdom from his father Rwabugiri IV, but many of the king's council were unhappy. There was a rebellion and the family was killed. Yuhi Musinga inherited the throne through his mother and uncles, but there was still dissent.    German colonialism    War and division seemed to open the door for colonialism, and in 1897 German colonialists and missionaries arrived in Rwanda. The Rwandans were divided with a portion of the royal court being very wary and the other seeing the Germans as a welcome alternative to the dominance of Buganda or the Belgians. Backing their faction in the country a pliant government was soon in place. Rwanda put up far less resistance than Burundi to German rule.    In the early years the Germans had little control in the region and were completely dependent on the indigenous government. The Germans didn't encourage modernization and centralization of the regime.    During this period many Europeans had become obsessed with the study of race, and this had an impact on life in Rwanda. Now to the Germans, the Tutsi ruling class was a superior racial type who, because of their apparent "Hamitic" origins on the Horn of Africa, were more "European" than the Hutus they oppressed. Because of their seemingly taller stature, more "honorable and eloquent" personalities, and their willingness to convert to Roman Catholicism, the Tutsis were favored by colonists and powerful Roman Catholic officials, and were put in charge of the farming Hutus (almost in a feudalistic manner), the newly formed principalities, and were given basic ruling positions. Eventually, these positions would turn into the overall governing body of Rwanda. Thus the Tutsi oppression of the Hutus seemed somehow normal and expected. As with later Belgian colonizers, the Germans romanticized Tutsi origins.    Before the colonial period about 15-16% of the population was Tutsi; many of these were poor peasants, but the majority of the ruling elite were Tutsi. A significant minority of the political elite were Hutu, however. Europeans simplified this arrangement and decided that the Hamitic Tutsi were racially superior and should thus make up the entire ruling class, while the inferior Bantu Hutu should become a permanent underclass.    The Germans, simply out of their need for a streamlined administration, helped the Mwami gain greater nominal control over Rwandan affairs. But there were forces that entered with the German colonial authority that had the opposite effect. For instance, Tutsi power weakened through the exposure of Rwanda to capitalist European forces. Money came to be seen by many Hutus as a replacement for cattle, in terms of both economic prosperity and for purposes of creating social standing. Another way in which Tutsi power was weakened by Germany was through the introduction of the head-tax on all Rwandans. As some Tutsis had feared, the introduction of this tax also made the Hutus feel less bonded to the will of their Tutsi patrons and more dependent on the European foreigners, any head-tax necessarily implying equality between any of those heads being counted - whether Hutu or Tutsi. Thus, despite Germany's attempt to uphold traditional Tutsi domination of the Hutus, the Hutus were now getting a slight taste of autonomy from Tutsi rule.      World War I    While the agreements dividing the region had called for the region to remain neutral in the event of any European war, this was disregarded after the outbreak of World War I. Small forces of Europeans, backed by large numbers of locals fought for control of the region. The main offensive was by the Belgians who quickly forced the German forces out of the region. A British offensive from Uganda came next, British machine gunners preventing the Germans from mounting a sucsessful counter-attack. The German army was now in almost a full panic and retreat. The Belgians then released Congolese raiders who proceeded to loot and pillage the region. A great number of Rwandans, who were fighting alongside the Germans, were killed in the long German retreat.      Belgian colonialism    At the end of the war the League of Nations mandated Rwanda and its southern neighbor, Burundi, to Belgium as the territory of Ruanda-Urundi. The portion of the German territory, never a part of the Kingdom of Rwanda, was stripped from the colony and attached to Tanganyika, which had been mandated to the British.    The Belgian government continued to rely on the Tutsi power structure for administering the country. It also consistently favored the direct and harsh polices that had been instituted by the Germans. The Belgians insisted that the colony turn a profit, and this meant forcing the population to grow large quantities of coffee. Each peasant was required to devote a certain percentage of their fields to coffee and this was enforced by the Belgians and their local, mainly Tutsi, allies. An onerous corve was also introduced, labour that was enforced by the whip - eight strokes before work each morning. This forced labour approa
AA11442722	2031 is the year Unix based systems face the Y2k problem. This could cause some of the kinds of glitches predicted for y2k most of which didn't happen since few critical systems run on Microsoft software and because critical software on all platforms were modified before that date. A similer effort will be necessary in 2031.     There is I believe another near miss astroid heading our way in that year. Though that is a bit far out for current prediction models. More of a guess as new as the science is of predicting astroid orbits.     2031 was I believe the year picked where overpopulation would become critical in a 70s book that had dramatic impact on society.

v70p2kgWaa	My suggestion for you is to contact an art muesum or even a college in your area.  You probably won't be able to check anything out, but these are the best resources available and oftentimes the staff are willing to help you find the information you need.  Muesum library collections tend to be small but they are specialized and those running them tend to know a lbit more of the ends and outs of art than your public librarians (not all art muesums have libraries open to the public, call and ask).   University libraries are held to a lot of various accreditation programs including the art department thus if a local university or college is accredited in art, their library is bound to have some resources (both books and database though apparently the art program is more concerned with books).  Also if the regular reference staff is unable to help you, always ask if they have an art librarian.  Acedemic librarians especially at universities (though some colleges too) have librarians who specifically work with a collection and may know some more places you can look.

Take your camera everywhere you go, snapping everything on your way.

Get in the habit of taking pics so frequently that the last thing you want to do is preview any single shot, just let them add up and sort through them at the end of the day. Make a memory card and an extra battery must haves to keep up with your shutter finger. There is incredible beauty throughout the everyday world that is all to often missed. So don't even try, just do, and keep doing - a lot. After a while you'll recognize your strengths and weaknesses, you'll get a feel for what you really enjoy photographing, and the things you don't care so much for.

It would probably be best to make everything sequential, so scanning your best sketches or sketches showing your process and then creating something that will present them in a professional/creative way and fitting with the format of the rest of your work would be a good idea.

I feel just like you. After my 10-day 4-book reading marathon of the Twilight series, I came out of my room and wondered, "What do I do now?"  My sister read the Host book, she said the beginning was very dry and hard to get through, but once she had tackled two thirds of it, it started to get interesting.      I am not into sci-fi and probably wont read it. I read Dean Koontz book "False Memory". Its a great book! Its lengthy (like Twilight) and actually much more suspenseful. Its about a houspainter and his wife (video game designer) They wake up one morning suddenly stricken with paralyzing fears. I really dont want to give too much away because its a great read! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, like Twilight, although I felt so attached to the Twilight characters.....|`|v0fooLeTaa	After Twilight read:    The host - It's a must read although you can't compare it to the Twilight Series.

15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	Try posting a direct link to your blog, like this:    http://blog.andrew.ac.nz/    For tech writing I see little wrong with your blog postings. It's not great literature by any means but then again it doesn't need to be for your target audience.    My only real suggestion is that your adjectives are a little too cliched. I know you can do better because you have a fairly decent vocabulary.     Example:    "Wow. That's one of the phrases that came to mind when I stumbled upon..." (Wow may be what came to mind but it's not exactly a phrase of note.)     Example:    "The materials available from the sidebar links are great." (Nothing wrong with this sentence. It's just standard flair. You can do better.)    Example:    "Its so much cooler than that last rhyme." (Again, there's nothing wrong with this sentence. Except you should think about it a moment. Ask yourself who says 'so much cooler?' Other than ten year old boys or girls who uses a phrase like this?)    You have to fit the language to your target audience. If you're aiming at kids who say 'way cooler' then you're fine. If not, think about how you come across to those you're writing for.    You have the talent, the vocabulary, to write as well as you make the effort to. Just try to stay away from cliches as much as possible and aim your writing towards the intelligence level of the audience you want to reach.|`|FF9mMlgKaa	you got no trademark kid.

The kind of person who would use a word like "gloatful" probably has some issues him/herself. Some people are just trolls.    What I would do is get someone to read your blog posts before you post them -- someone whose style you admire. Maybe you could find a peer, and read his/her blog posts in return. This is just a good policy.    And since you've asked for constructive criticism, please make sure your words mean what you think they mean. "The critic is often cynical of me." I think you mean "critical" or "disparaging" instead. A good reader will catch these not-quite-right words before they go into print. Also, just carefully reading things yourself, and pausing when something seems to not read right can be a big help.    Keep blogging! It's the only way you'll learn! And ignore the trolls! If this critical person doesn't do anything for you, consider kill-filing him/her.

A small story i hope you do not mind, but i spent many years on the streets i was what you would call a gutter punk. Back in the early 90's i was really young and confused on what normalcy and society wanted  so i rebelled against everything you name it i started it from marches to sit-ins i was a enemy to conformity. i was like that for many years when these kids one year around i would say 97-98 they were preppy kids but put color in there hair, they were wearing ripped jeans but new shoes. i asked them where they got there clothes from and they told me they bought them that way they also told me they bought a can of fake spray dirt that makes your jeans look like you have never washed them in months. i was shaken but i thought it was only a fad but then they were coming in droves and i lost it cut my hair and promised to never follow a fad again.    i have kept that way all these years and will never follow the heard.|`|jeGDvHWaaa	Be who you want, but others may want you to be someone else.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Be true to yourself, an old time saying about self indulgence.

s0UbZ7vsaa	personally, i practiced with acoustic first,   it's hard at first but it's a good exercise for you to press the chords easier, and even easier to an electric guitar    if you practice on electric first, it'll be harder for you to play the acoustic coz you'll get use to pressing electric guitar's softer strings|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	if your wanting to do rock music, change to an electric and get an amp, it will sound a lot better and it's easier on your fingers.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Your fingers are supposed to hurt on acoustic; your left hand that is. Because your fingers aren't used to the pressure.    But, since you have a cheap acoustic, the action could be too high and needs to be lowered.    I started on acoustic and it made electric easier, especially pressing down the strings. It's ultimately your choice which one you want to take up.|`|AA12301704	It doesn't matter as far as learning how to play. The electric is more fun and it is easier to press the strings down.  But, you can carry the acoustic around and play anywhere and there for, practice more. Practice is the key.  Check to see if your strings are too high. Maybe you can deepen the notches; or buy a better guitar.  Nothing is more discouraging than producing a bad sound.|`|3d005f3152993c5b6a9efa541cbfbf1faa	Acoustic. Hands down.No one should play the electric guitar without learning the acoustic. Except you could try the Electric Acoustic guitar. It's an acoustic guitar that's amplified (and sounds amazing!!).|`|1xgdsNfOaa	Hey Eric,  I work at guitar center and get this question everyday, theres the good and possibly bad about working with each.  With acoustic guitar there are is a lot to cover:  Nothing is more frustrating than starting off on a cheap guitar, honestly.  Not the price but the quality, the better the craftsmanship= the easier it will be to play and the better it will sound (keeps you encouraged).  They do require thicker strings which have more tension, which makes it "harder" to push down and bend the strings, but that is common with any one. Thing is it shouldnt be "too" hard. If starting off on acoustic i recommend something with a fairly low action (distance between frets and string), and something that sounds good to you, no one can tell you what that will be. Then go buy some "light gage" strings... less tension= less work on your fingers.    I started off on electric and I had "no" issue switching to acoustic. Electrics are definitely a little bit easier on the fingers but they do have much skinnier necks, which "might" make might make it easier or harder, depending on your hand size.  I have very big hands but once you practice, chords on electric are no problem.    I recommend going with the one that fits your music style best.  If you love metal and rock, or the sound of electric guitar, an acoustic isnt going to cut it, you might get bored. vice versa      Recomendations on acoustics:  any seagull brand guitar, great quality for the $$  Also ibanez acoustics have nice skinney necks and fairly lower action

dHjjLozcaa	It was a little odd, but also kinda heartwarming. I could see what he meant. When he said it he was saying goodbye pretty much forever cause Edward didn't know if he was going to survive and see Jake and Renesmee again, and he knew that Jacob and Renesmee would get married eventually some day, and technically he would be his father-in-law. But I can see why you wouldn't really like it, I don't like thinking of Edward as a pedophile either, lol.|`|daza5A4vaa	I didn't even remember he said that.

My dad calls my husband son because that's how he sees him and my husband calls him dad because my dad is more of a father to him than his own father.

6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	Getting atheists to attend an atheist church would be like herding cats.  Atheists are a very diverse bunch; lack of belief in a god or gods is about the only thing we have in common.    And like a previous answerer said, atheists do congregate, just not for religious reasons.  I know my social life isn't wanting.  My wife (who is Buddhist) and I (atheist) attend plenty of dinner parties and other social gatherings.    There are, however, groups aimed just at atheists.  Many colleges (well, maybe not the smaller ones) have freethinker clubs, and there are many online communities where rational-minded people can discuss topics such as science, skepticism, logic, the psychology of belief (one of my favorites), challenges to church-state separation, philosophy (including metaphysics & epistemology), the bible (many atheists I know are far more knowledgeable about the bible than many xtians), education, outreach, etc. etc. etc.    If ever there was anything akin to an atheist church, though, I recommend the writings of Robert G. Ingersoll as its bible and Richard Dawkins as pope.  :-)|`|OqlXBUsaaa	it's more than an hour past.  they will think twice before they go to sleep. and when they wake up, they are the same still, a character of an atheist. wanna bet?|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Atheists do not have a church They congregate everywhere but church.|`|sxKaorAXaa	A church based on science.

AA10744471	Yes and no. It is really dependent on how you view US history from a conservative point of view or from a liberal point of view. However, in my opinion, Zinn is a reliable writer on US history.|`|a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	Since Zinn counters the establishment spin in his perspectives, then he is probably reliable.  The U.S. government and the power elite don't exactly have a track record of telling it straight to the American public, because they want to give the illusion that they serve the people, and are the saviors of the modern world.  Those in the know understand that, for the most part, American foreign and domestic policy serves the interests of the wealthy and Corporate America, not the interests of the common man.|`|AA11657414	Good Grief, no...his book should be under "fiction" or "alternative realities".   I have read extensively in history for 40 plus years and went through his book with a growing sense of distaste and wonder, and pity for those who's only exposure to history would be his propaganda leftish views.  There is little doubt in history about certain facts; this happened that happened and it happened then. WHY something happened is the reason for the study of history, and a good book would give a, b and c as possible reasons and how they would tie together.    Zinn gives only one set of views, ignores hundreds of years of work by others, and selectively picks "facts"..and there is some question about the factualness of some facts.....to present a view shared by no others.    It would be like getting your political news ONLY from the Moral Majority or MoveOn....not exactly balanced. Or studying 20th century political thought and reading ONLY Das Kapital or Mein Kamph.....
ZJ2k7Ynqaa	It has something to do with the Mayan calendar.  Study what the Bible has to say about the end times.

The Mayan calander ending, a prediction from a little known English prophet are the two main predicitons though some have decided that Nostrodomus and others have also made the same prediction.     There are other risk factors that are unrelated to the date but could be real issues in the near future such as a super volcano eruption. Yellowstone is possibly late and if it were to erupt it would cause one might big bump in the road of civilization. The possibility of WW III is closer than it's been since the 60s. With nuclear esculation among so many unstable nations the possibility of nuclear war has gone from unlikely to almost enevitable at this point.

These calendars are based on a calculation called The Great Year, and total the numbers of all the "ages" of the zodiac.  Thus The Great Year is around 26,000 years long!    Perhaps you have heard of the Age of Aquarius? These "ages" are numbered in the plus 2000-year range.  The last "age" was Pisces, said to have begun after the death of the Messiah. The new age is showing its appearance as the world suffers a major and long-term financial crisis, with unrest and toppled markets coinciding. The time has come for the peoples of the earth to manage their own resources instead of leaving it to the high and mighty.    Read: Graham Hancock's "Fingerprints of the Gods" to get a deep insight into the calendars, astrology, and that which is ending.    Understand also that each ending marks a new beginning. Thus the Age of Aquarius, which is upon us here on the Internet, is about to take down the high and mighty (the chimney structure of power which was held by the Roman Army, and later copied by the Holy Roman Catholic Church, and lately seen in the structures of corporations) and replace the power structure using real people, managing politics, finance, health administration and many more public policy structures, through the new structure for power: Networks which range the social and political spectrum, responding to the need to manage social needs through the Internet.

In Asutralia that would be year 10-11.

And I believe The Betrayal of Bindy Mackenzie takes place a year after Finding Cassie Crazy.    And I'm sure in Finding Cassie Crazy one of the girls say that they're year 10.

Can you?      Now...  Jesus DID all of these things through the power of God.  Jesus is the SON of God.  God so loved the world and sent His only SON Jesus to be a living sacrifice for the sins of the world.  Jesus bore our pain and sins and died on a cross for ALL of MANKIND.  INCLUDING...You, Me, your neighbor, Al Qaida, Osama Bin Laden, child molesters, murders, thiefs...EVERYONE.  Jesus loved us so much that He died for us, it's true.  AND all YOU have to do is simply ask for forgiveness of your wrong doings and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior.  Once you have done this, your name will be written in the Lamb's Book of Life.  If it isn't there, you can not enter the kingdom of heaven.  You don't have to be a "holy roller" but a personal loving relationship with God will do.  The Bible isn't just a book, many of the words were Jesus' own words.  He is real!|`|wLwNIxPpaa	when is a book a book?  (Fahrenheit 451 read it)|`|OBA3Iciraa	yep, it's a book. no matter how you look at it, it's still a book.|`|v70p2kgWaa	Yet your argument fails in one big area.  Religious text and traditional text cannot be classified as just books because they are written accounts of oral tradition.  The Bible spent many years being past around as verbal tales before it was ever written down.  Even the new testament this is believed to be true.  Also your argument fails to account for cultural identity another major piece of that takes it far beyond "just another book".    If you want to argue it to be traditional tale/oral text be my guest, but do not place it in the same realm as inspirational fiction because it's not.  It has long cultural and historical ties that such a demeaning phrase of "just a book" does not account for.  I don't believe in the same thing as Muslims do but I won't call their text "just a book" nor would I call any of the Native American tales "just stories".  The depth of knowledge in any of these texts is rich and amazing.  Please be considerate to this fact.  I see you put a lot of thought into your argument, but in constructing your argument you did exactly what people go to war over, literal translations.  If you start looking beyond that you can start seeing a lot more to the Bible as well as other religious texts out there.|`|ky3B42f6aa	The bible is a collection of myths going way back to the Assyrian and the Babylonian cultures. This is one reason that it is so full of "nonsense" and "magic".   The new testament was written by imaginative men 50-60 years after the fact, who had never met this Jesus fellow.  It is also full of mistakes and "magic".  If this god-person was the heavenly editor, he/she/it must have been either asleep or having coffee in the restaurant at the edge of the universe when these writers were busy putting together these fairy tales. And, if the fact that it was oral tradition means it is NOT a book in the literary sense, than neither is the Iliad, which was probably written down around the same time, if not before.|`|NCy5Oj0jaa	It seems like just a collection of myths to me, but I guess it just all has to do with all the faith thing|`|hqxnCZzzaa	they are stories by god to live by  to set an example|`|ltynE2kOaa	it was the work of a storyteller that was able to convince people that the stories really happened.    its like how some people take harry potter seriously :/|`|045b416d188c238fdb9551f85c247982aa	Their is a whole school of Bible study that looks at The Bible as literature.|`|Xvu8e5joaa	Christians are entitled to think what they like, just as you are entitled to think as you do.

You should too. My family and i are such strong believers that we experience even the little miracles and appreciate them.    The stories in the Bible is real, i'm just saying, but if u have your opinions, then go ahead. I'm just trying to say what i think is right.|`|K5SZZh6Iaa	No, I do not think the way you do. Why do you think that these things couldn't be done? Things operate on different levels. Jesus can do things because he is on a higher level than us. We are on a level known as the telestrial and the level it takes to do the things Jesus can do, you need to have the priesthood. You may not believe me and think of me as some other religious person, but what I say is what I believe.    There is also the things with the Animals. Animals, plants, and every lower intelligence from us is title as "Acted upon" since we use them for our daily lives. We are "To Act" thus making us the higher intelligence. The animals came to Noah because God commanded them to do so, to keep their species alive after he flooded the entire world (and not only for the reasons to that are stated.)     Yes, I know, none of that makes sense, but it's probably because I'm tired right now and I don't want to explain everything. I only want to say that I know the bible is a recond written on the people's events, and the Book of Mormon is another true testament.     In the end though it's you who makes the decision on what to believe. Not us.|`|qJfKeeslaa	With God all things are possible.

Its hard to explain my life and try to give some sort of evidence, most would think i am crazy but things happen in my life that always turn out good and i do not even try. I use to think it was positive thought but then i did not think of most of the strange things that have happened to me.    1 ran away at 14 wanted to die always had someone help me or follow me have never been alone in my life.    2 being homeless i never starved i always found money or food or people to help me.    3 when i was on self-destruct mode i used drugs and always found them where ever i went  free booze pot coke you name it all i had to do was think of it and it would appear within a couple hours.    4 i did not want love, i found love 11 years ago and gave up after that. i always ran from women who tried to love me and gave nothing in return, i went for knowledge instead of sex then i broke down 8 months ago and cried to the heavens i want love back in my life. a week later i found the woman i lost all those years ago and we married within three weeks i could go on all day but thats the short story.|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	its a movie|`|f5R5BPTDaa	You have to read between the lines to really get the true message from the movie. You don't actually sit and vision things and then they appear like magic.  Although my life has completely turned for the better since i first watched it, it took much more insight than the movie gives you to really understand the concept of attracting all that is good and all that you want. You have to start with yourself. You absolutely have to put work and discipline into motion.  When you "feel" good (positive), you attract the same into your life.  The key is understanding and learning how to do this. When I take excellent care of myself, I take excellent care of my life. When I take excellent care of my life, everyone and everything of great substance wants to surround me. I am offered jobs, healthy, good looking men want to date me, everything seems to flow very easy. When I feel great, I find it very easy to cycle 30 miles and while Im at the track, I meet other dynamic, healthy people that are going somewhere. When you strive for better, better  will happen for you. If you drink and do drugs constantly, you are not going to feel "REAL" well, and you wont "BE" well. You wont meet people that are going anywhere and you certainly cant tap into your true authentic spiritual ENERGY if you are living in the cesspool of life.  The main idea is "being grateful" for what you have. Knowing that there is divine power somewhere and learning how to "feel" you way into all your hopes and dreams.  The Secret says now where that everything happens for a reason. That is not a the message in the movie anywhere. If your whole family was killed tomorrow, would you say, "Well, everything happens for a reason?' No you would not. Watch it again, with an open mind this time. Its not about magic, its about putting your hope and dreams into action and "Feeling the positive vibrations this universe has to offer us."  I hope this helped some. It has changed everything about my life and for this is just another thing that I am grateful for. The concept is much more simple than you can probably even imagine but once you do, you can really start living your best life yet.|`|amcqJkWhaa	I think it would be a good idea to check out:   http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattrac...    Anyhow, I figure there is truth in anything you hear, since it exists... But, umm, though I like the idea of law of attraction a lot, and I do believe it's quite true, there's like a whole world of takes on it that you can find out about.. I think these philosophies are more like a beginning than an end... So, things won't close up more-- if it's the right kind of thinking (don't dwell on my choice of words over much), it perhaps should open up to other ideas... Because, if the universe is really unlimited, why would we want a closed formula or closed system...? You have to percieve life as it really is, and believe that life is good, or that your opinion or choice is your own court...     You can say life happens for a reason, and life doesn't happen for any reason, and I suppose they're both true... But I guess what's important is that we keep to our dreams of gentle lullabies, or something...   There is also such thing as transcendence, which transcends true and untrue. I think that's buddhism talk, but then again all talk is based from humanity...|`|DMpVSHvXaa	I keep posting this same answer with regards to the Law of Wishful Thinking, but anyways...    *snort*|`|AA11931783	i think yes there is a reason for everything that happen in life but wat that reason is no one except god knows|`|KblMZiHpaa	i actually never saw the movie or read the book ( it is a book too right, red cover with like fire on it?) but i swear i've thought that for YEARS.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Attr...    copy and paste that link into your browser to read the wikipedia article... yea yea yea i know wikipedia isn't a great source in the eyes of many but it does offer an excellent starting point from background knowlegde.    my own take on everything happening for a reason: i really do believe that everything does happen for a reason. i also think that you can will things to happen. if you want something BADLY enough, you will make it happen because you will make the decisions and choices to make it happen even if feels like you're physically doing nothing. i guess it all ties back into the things you're taught when you're little : shoot for the stars, do your best, etc.     in harry potter , when hagrid first goes to harry he says something along the lines of "ever done things that you didn't know you could do , ever wondered how you made things happen..."  well your question kinda reminded me about that and even if jk rowling most likely didn't intend it , i feel like the idea of magic is kind of a symbolic for the law of attraction (or the law of attraction as i've interpreted it).    i hope something i said helped :)|`|N97lSGuxaa	yes, actually.  you can, sit around pretending what you want is yours and it WILL appear, because it has to.  but no one believes that it will actually work that way therefore it usually doesn't work... because you have to believe it.  everything in life does happen for a reason because the reason is everythings been attracted by thoughts.

NR4hbYPiaa	I think it started with New Wave music in the early 80's, long hair was very popular from the Beatles era in the mid 60's but had faded out by the end of disco in the late 70's|`|AA10729675	Not long compared with all the centuries passed!|`|yJQpxV75aa	Since they first cut it.|`|AA11442722	That is a fairly recent trend actually. It started with the Norman invasion of England. Up until that time the only men with short hair were monks. The Normans shaved their hair short as a pledge before setting out for England. After conquering England they continued to do so for a time as a sort of celibration.     In England the trend stayed on with certain segments. The Caviliers were known for their long locks and Cromwell's men mostly short haired as a kind of protest and part of the Protostant reformation thing. A sort of a sacrafice to be plainer and more "Godly" by eschewing worldly things. Long hair on dudes in England became much less common after the English Civil war.     In America short hair didn't really become all that common west of the East coast until the army required all soldiers to wear short hair. Several US Generals resigned from the army in protest or were drummed out of the army for failing to cut their hair. If you look at pics of the old Gun Fighters many of them like Hickock had long hair. On the East coast short hair was becoming the norm and by 1900 has become the norm in the US.|`|vleQLpBhaa	Since the invention of the wig in Ancient Egypt...  Egyptians consider their own hair "unclean", that's why they cut it (bald) and they wear wigs of short hair.  Females had short hair, and so as men...

ji7WZvC1aa	A 500-seater is not a small theatre by any stretch of the imagination!  At that size, it would need to be more than a black box theatre or studio space; to get it designed so that it functions properly as a theatre you'd need a theatre consultant (architects have no idea about what makes a theatre a wonderful place to work in, or an absolutely awful place to work in).  You're talking millions at the very least.|`|nQ3kFPMVaa	Probably at least a million. My university has a 120 seat theatre, with proper rigging (ie. flying lighting bars), bio box, foyer, and all necessary equipment. When they needed to repair the rigging, it cost them about $60 000.     I'm no architect, but I would suspect it's a hell of a lot of money to construct. It also depends on what you need; you might not need a flying rig, but instead use a static set of bars. The biggest thing is that it needs to be safe, and it needs to be flexible for your needs; and that you also have to factor in equipment, safety equipment, repairs and regular safety checks. Also, you're probably going to need to hire a trained professional to oversee the use of the venue.    I'd head over to my local theatrical venue (of roughly the same size) and have a chat to their administrators and techies and see how much money they spend on upkeep, and find out how much the venue cost to set up.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    Aside from what one poster mentions, add guitar sweeps (arpeggios) in your composition. These are always eye-openers when done right especially diminished arpeggios.     Also, a 5-note chromatic riff going from 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1 etc...fits well before or after an arpeggio.    Another nice technique for a riff is to play 5 consecutive note in this manner....  1-2-3-4_4 (the underscore means to slide to the 5th note)  and them back 4-3-2-1_1 (slide index )    You can use finger-tapping, combined with pull-offs, hammer-ons.  You can also use, legatos, backhand picking which is accomplished by doing an arpeggio backward ( a little hard but effective)    You can do a 4-note slur and bend on the last note (hold and sustain).    As for the other technique, you can use economy-picking which is effective if you need to do a very fast riff.    Some ideas....Good Luck !!!|`|dqoitQ8Jaa	Many different techniques to produce "texture".  Here are some.  Bending, hammer on, artificial harmonics. tremolo picking, tapping, scrapping, slide, pluck and thump, de-tuning, travis picking.  Now if you wanna get peddles involved, wow, there are too many to list.  Have fun!
dYQUQGflaa	I hardly ever get to a book store so when I do go I'm there for over an hour at least every time.    I usually spend 30 mins in one genre, then wander around and look for writings that are interesting but that I usually wouldn't read.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Honestly, I could LIVE in a bookstore...especially the ones that have a Starbucks in them. I may spend a little more time in a specific section if I'm looking for something specific, but I do tend to wander around most of the time.|`|2c4e6005843e2624086af284a2e71120aa	I scan titles of all genres.

If I am in a chain, like Borders, I tend to stick to genres which interest me, just because there is too much to browse thoroughly. However, if I'm in a used bookstore, I make sure to check each section carefully, so that I don't miss anything fantastic.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	everywhere but mostly in the Sci/fi and discount sections|`|AA11989999	I regularly look in about four sections--science fiction; crime novels; New Releases; and Psychology/Occult/Spiritual.|`|zviDShi6aa	I am such a wanderer.

AA10744471	I think this is the mini-course for healing and peace of mind:    THE 18-DAY MINI-COURSE FOR HEALING RELATIONSHIPS AND                             BRINGING ABOUT PEACE OF MIND    1. I am never upset for the reason I think.  2. I am determined to see things differently.  3. I can escape from the world I see by giving up attack thoughts.  4. I am not the victim of the world I see.  5. There is another way of looking at the world.    6. I could see peace instead of this (situation, feelings, etc.).  7. There is nothing to fear.  8. Fear is not justified in any form.  9. To give and to receive are one in truth.  10. Forgiveness is the key to happiness.    11. All that I give is also given to me.  12. In my defenselessness my safety lies.  13. Today, I will judge nothing that occurs.  14. This instant is the only time there is.  15. The past is over; it can touch me not.     16. Only my condemnation injures me.  17. I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt.  18. I am responsible for what I see, I choose the feelings I experience, I decide upon the goal I will achieve, and everything that seems to happen to me I ask for and receive as I have asked.
Xf8Z6rJfaa	all the time lol..but i usually wait a while to read it again so i can get the full effect once more|`|2jxWrnUGaa	yes i do =D|`|6rrVUYslaa	yes..i do|`|fKrnQx5iaa	Yes, it's fun because you catch smaller details that in the first time missed out on.|`|AA11669456	you bet I do! I've reread To Kill A Mockingbird at least 7 times...the Great Gatsby about two or three times, David Sedaris' novels, etc. If it's that good, it's worth rereading|`|SHE7SAGWaa	yep i always do if i really like the book so most of the time|`|RW92wDQ8aa	i do all the time!  i have read the Harry Potter series all the way through SEVEN TIMES!  i re-read most everything i enjoy reading the first time!|`|AGaQ4lpiaa	It would depend on the book    i can't keep re-reading the book Straight after i finished it  i need time  But i will constantly find my favourite bits and read those bits    Cindy ?|`|S2AU75uQaa	Absolutely. I usually skim to my favorite parts though.|`|qRgPA9fSaa	Not usually, but I'm sorry, HARRY POTTER IS TOO GOOD TO ONLY READ ONCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  lol  = )|`|XNIkS3KNaa	I've re-read mangas before. :)|`|GFzDwIk6aa	All the time.  I always find out little things that I missed first time around.|`|daza5A4vaa	Yep (:  All the time.|`|fAcVndo7aa	Constantly.     People laugh at me, but I always seem to find some little detail I missed the first time, especially when I re-read a series.    For instance, the Harry Potter series - did anyone else notice in book 6, the foreshadowing of book 7, when Slughorn says that you shouldn't ever underestimate the power of obsessive love?  Didn't catch that the first time, since there wasn't a big example of it until the next book came out...    Yup, I'm a loser, go ahead and give me thumbs down.  I'll be over here, reading.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Yes. There's some I've read many time.  The Lord of the Rings.  The Clan of the Cave Bear.  The Horatio Hornblower series.  and a few others.|`|n03LF2Jaaa	Never - I can't wait to get into my next book!|`|COrmcWTBaa	Yeah, for me the first time I read a book, I tend to rush throught the book in anticipation of finding out what happened...  The second time is so I can fully appreciate the writing, the humor and the little things that wont be noticed the first time and understand better what happened...    Hope that HELPS!|`|AA11890009	yeah.........sure|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Sure. some stories are just that good.|`|gH6Ttoz8aa	All the time!  I've read Harry Potter millions of times!  + loads of other books.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Yup, and I tend to enjoy them more the second time around because I tend to read really fast when I get into a book and sometimes I miss some of the details, which I catch the second time I read them! If the book is really good I start re-reading immediately after I finish it...I know huh? I'm a weirdo|`|lU12YtI2aa	Oh sure!  Especially ones I really loved the first time through & have gone several years since reading them.  I find I have forgotten a lot of the details & it is almost like reading them for the first time.
r2M65FKUaa	Make a game of it.  I assume by chord changes that you are talking about correct fretting.  If you are, and you're having trouble getting the correct positions within your time limit, write out or memorize a pattern. Don't focus so much on speed as consistency. By making a game of it, play your pattern and when you mess up ( you will, but don't worry about it) then stop, and start the pattern again. This may make you a bit more frustrated, but it will bring out a competitive streak. You'll want to beat your record, and once you can play the pattern perfectly at a slow tempo, then speed up and up and up. Talk to a musician with more experience in the genre you're focusing on, and find out what progressions are common. Integrate those into your pattern, and get playing!|`|d37aa94bad07542cb4de0984130f5a33aa	Simple:     Look up tabs of songs you like online and learn them|`|clgc86Voaa	Practice, Practice, Practice. It takes A LOT of practice to be a very good guitarist. You are just learning so take it easy and dont be in such a hurry. Just go to the chords one at a time and make sure it sounds right first. Go slow and then start speeding up. You just need to get use to the guitar you have. If you practice a lot you will find a pattern that you can make to change to the next chord. Dont worry all you need to do is be patient. Mastering a guitar can take years, but dont give up. Are you self-taught or are you being taught by a guitar teacher?|`|1uU7Sdavaa	well i can say that i have had the same problem when i play piano i'd be able to only do so much one day and then alot more the next  maybe what you need to do is not worry about how much you can get done and how fast you need to do and just take your time  i know that whole "practice make perfect" thing is annoying but it is true but like i said dont try to worry about your speed. another thing find a musical piece or your favorite song and learn to play it. it'll be fun for ya!  hope i help|`|Ua3rJomUaa	Dear music is for soul. You have to discover the rythm which is around you in the natural phenomenas. You have to feel the rythm of your heart and have to convey by guitar honestly to others then you will enjoy with command.|`|4a0ee677ac88c105760e773f0faca674aa	you are doing a great job that is much faster than i learned or anyone else i've taught learned so good job, don't get frustrated too easily!  i've never had a lesson in my life, i was a self-taught guitarist. however i only started playing seriously this past december when i got a real guitar. anyways guitar is harder to play than it looks, but it is so worth it. the way i taught myself was by learning all the basic chords: a, d, c, g, e, f, which you can play most songs with. it didn't take me too long to be able to switch quickly between chords. i think one hard part of guitar is strumming. you have to find your rhythm which could take a while. as far as finger picking, the very first song i learned was hey there delilah. i practiced picking patterns and i have improved alot. basically like with everything, it takes practice. i would say after the semester of guitar, you will probably be an intermediate guitarist. guitar is really fun though, you can play almost any song on guitar!|`|f119152bd1437cee7c5e5e39298c2733aa	Your not attempting to play the guitar, your simply trying to play fast. First try to play it. Dont worry about speed, it will come with time. First try to play something with the things you already know. Make a song up. Just let it flow and enjoy|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Do you practice everyday? Then it will come with time. I like game idea, that can really help to build speed. It does take time to build speed on a guitar, especially with chords. If you've only been playing for a week and a half and already know at least 8 chord changes that's a good start! Don't get discouraged so easily. My wife has been playing for about 8 years and only in the last 3 has she really made significant changes. Since she started playing everyday it has made a difference in her ability as well as her knowledge base of notes, chords, scales, and rhythms.|`|xX9D292Laa	If i have learned anything from modern rock and roll cocaine seems to help all guitarist focus and play better.|`|WNSG3RNoaa	Try practicing with a friend or group, that tends to help...|`|s0UbZ7vsaa	i had this problem too,....  but what i did was, i tried to practice a song i liked and memorized it's chords first...  eventually, i played different songs and so far i know most of them,...  i didn't lose interest after then, and i juz got excited to learn another song ^-^|`|aRwhJKpHaa	dont quit i bought a guitar 2 years ago then quit and then in th summer i started playing again now im pretty good if ur bored of learning chords u can read tabs

This will give flexbility.  and    1-2-1-2-3-2-3-4 and backward 4-3-4-3-2-3-2-1  and    1-2-1-3-1-4-1-3-1-2 repeat 10 to 20 times.

IVy35SE2aa	my fifty cent dictionary defines supervenience: to come or happen  as something additional or unexpected.    When a body comes down the birth canal it is united with  the mind or you would have a stillbirth. Once the merger is made you have an entity that usually is capable of learning and given  the right environment can grow physically and mentally.

uhc1MCDzaa	The first question that is the heading seems to be quite different than the content of the rest of the question.    I believe it isn't a coward who dies many times before actual death because it takes a courageous heart to be afraid and still do the right thing even though the fear of death is there as your constant companion through your courageous actions.    Yes I have had sleepless nights and many a better scene in my head where I win. The insulting person I tell off grandly and come out feeling powerful.

The hangers on in a gang would later give one a wide berth if they had earlier witnessed their tougher brethren taking a few punches.

fLmlpGu7aa	Suicide is the cowards way out and the biggest cowards are the ones who wish they could just go to sleep and never wake up. No one has the perfect life. We are all faced with different problems but the ones who give up without giving it all they've got either are unaware that other options exist because they don't want to try and are cowards or are aware but don't want to try and are lazy cowards.

qRgPA9fSaa	It's FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm writing too and you're doing really good! BUT, and I have told this to every person who has put parts of their story on here, DON'T DO IT! anyone can just take your ideas, maybe not actual story lines, but certain type of your writing style and the originality of your story.  I'm up to editing my book now and I'm dying to just show it to people and ask them what they think but I wouldn't even give away a single character name until I'm published and copyrighted!    It's good to see the writing coming though, I love it!  = )|`|7MXbEx5Waa	I think that is pretty good. I can be a bit picky with the books I read and going by this piece of the first chapter you have here I would want to know the rest. What the plot is and how she ends up. The character seems a bit like an attention seeker if that is what you are trying to get across then you did a good job. You do get to know her a bit in these few paragraphs which can be tricky to do.    Very good work. Hope you get on well finishing the book and I hope to see it on shelf's. Thing is a live in New Zealand and you probably USA.    Would love to read more of it. If that is possible at all my email is amiemitchell@rocketmail.com    Once again good work.

This is the feminine form of the name Joseph, which is taken from the Hebrew name Yosef, meaning The Lord increases and also Beauty without compromise.Bakhita was born in Olgossa   a village in the western Sudanese region of Darfur.she was kidnapped by slave-traders at age 9, and given the name Bakhita by them. Sold and resold in the markets at El Obeid and Khartoum, finally purchased in 1883 by Callisto Legnani, Italian consul who planned to free her. She accompanied Legnani to Italy in 1885, and worked for the family of Augusto Michieli as nanny. She was treated well in Italy, and grew to love the country. An adult convert, joining the Church on 9 January 1890, she took the name of Josephine as a symbol of her new life . Her gentle presence, her warm, amiable voice, and her willingness to help with any menial task were a comfort to the poor and suffering people who came to the door of the Institute  of Canossian Daughters of Charity in Venice, Italy

AA11442722	Stage fright is surprisingly common for musicians. However there are lots of ways to deal with it. I've played hundreds of shows and even to this day right before I play my first note if I look out over the crowd I'll get a little shiver. Easy for me, I just look at my fretboard till we get a groove going. I lose myself in making the music. After that the audience is mostly a blur at first. I'm into the song not them and they are just like folks sitting around during a practice. There but not there if you get what I mean.     When you see them getting into what your doing then all reason to be nervous goes away. The more you play live the easier it gets to get up on stage. It's addicting even.     As for where to play. Start with a band. Once you have a band people will come over to listen to you guys after a bit. Then play at parties and open jams and things like that with smaller crowds. Mostly people you know and feel comfortable around.  If you play acoustic stuff cofee shops are fun gigs. Your right on top of the audience. However it's only really good for Folk style music.     No matter how good you are now, compared to how good you'll be 10 years from now if you stick with it you suck right now LOL. 10 years from now compared to how good you'll be in 20 you'll suck in 10 years also :) Long as your doing music your going to get better and better the more you do it. So as long as you have the natural voice to sing and the interest the rest you can and will learn.     As a singer though you have a special responsibility that is going to be a bit harder for you. Your the front man. You have to interact with the audience. Me on guitar I get to be anti-social. They might look at me specifically during a solo or something like that but I don't have to say a word to the audience and usually don't. You have to read the audience and if a gig is going bad you need to communicate that to the band to make adjustments. Figure out what's going on if possible. A good front man can make up for lack of vocal talent. Remember you speak for the whole band while your up there on stage.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Get some sort of lighting, a camera and a full length mirror now you can see all actions that cut it and those that don't. review the video so you see what everyone else sees.|`|6QRKMEXvaa	play at a local cafe or somewhere start for free  record songs in your bedroom n send it to the radio - put it on youtube  start piano lessons if u wnt  singing lessons help to gain confidence and strengthen voices    hope this helps x|`|3d005f3152993c5b6a9efa541cbfbf1faa	I feel what your going through.  Apparently my parents think I'm just amazing at guitar and pretty much brag to everyone about it. I think I'm okay for not playing that long, but my friend wanted me to play at the school talent show. I wanted to play for the show, but I didn't want to go up on stage and make a fool of myself . So, I asked my friend if she would like to sing, and me play backup, so even if all the guitar geeks would school come out and tell me how easy the song was, I can just say "I played backup." Also at the same time I conquered my fear of playing in front of crowds!  SO, the moral of the story is... Try singing with a friend, maybe you sing the alto part and your friend sings soprano (or vice versa.) Hmm.... no talent shows? Okay well if your good, you could record a few songs and then  make a music myspace, maybe? Or even audition for local musicals?  My dreams are to be a backup guitarist in a band. Most people will look at me (and think I want to sing like every other girl ) and I'm just a Taylor Swift waiting to happen. But no, I'm a Lead Zeppelin waiting to play for anyone who is willing to listen.|`|QXQWDw1qaa	As long as you don't have to speak, read or WRITE English, you should do OK.. but if you sing like you write.. you need to do stand-up comedy.

6fb9e966f191d1899219ced0684e780aaa	I have to give you a cruel answer, because the facts are cruel.  Most of the major cities of the South are populated with transplanted Yankees seeking their fortunes, because vast areas of the North are in decline and the Southerners who live with them are more interested in making money and buying things than in preserving a culture.  Not that there's anything unsouthern about making money and buying things; it's just a matter of perspective and what you are willing to sacrifice to do it.    This, coupled with the homogenization of America by mass media, is inevitably destroying the Southern culture.      In small towns it may still be found, hiding in the Spanish moss and kudzu, singing out loud on Sunday mornings, putting flowers on the memorials to the Confederate dead, and embracing hearts like sweat embraces bodies in the sultry piney woods on hot afternoons.     Sometimes it floats in the green waters of lakes,  keeping company with snakes and catfish, and some adults who learned the culture from the old folks still pass some of it on to their children, but their children do not feel it and live it as much as their ancestors did.    The South is contaminated and changing.  The South that I knew growing up is disappearing and will never rise again.|`|AA10442381	While I agree with you that the Civil War was about state's rights.  The two main rights in dispute was 1) The southern states didn't want to be led by Lincoln and 2) slavery.  I think it is important that there were several other secession attempts before the Civil War.  The Ohio Valley region threaten to secede sometime between 1795 and 1802 unless the Federal  Government did something to garurentee Americans the right to trade out of New Orleans.  There were several different attempts by New England states to secede over being forced to return runaway slaves and the inability to end the slave trade (these attempts were unsuccessful due to lack of widespread public support).    After John Brown's raid, it was clear that Northern Abolitionists would rest at nothing to forcibly end slavery, with no regard to the negative consquences of such an act would have on Southern farmers, Northern manufactures, the economy in general, or having a large population of new 'free' people without education, capital, or recognized legal standing.  Such a radical move would have devastated the country as thoroughly as the stock market crash in 1929.    Now to your point that the South is the only region that continues the traditions of the founding fathers through the strong moral fiber.      Did you know that George Washington (among many authors of the Constitution) were not religious men, and the only time in his adult life when Washington attended services regularly was during his tenure as president, and then only when in Philadelphia.  While they were professed Christians, and believed in Christian ideals, they were also pragmatists that followed there own moral code.    Also during the ratification process for the Constitution and the elections during the first 20 years there was as much muck racking, dirty politics, and negative campaigning as there is today.  While modern society has the ability to disseminate and showcase these ungentlemanly actions, they were just as effective back in 1800.    Within 8 years of ratification, laws were passed that violated the spirit and letter of the Constitution.  The Alien and Sedition acts allowed for political dissidents to be jailed, and "foreigner's" to be detained and removed at the governments discretion.  While the Constitution is a document of ideals, and the Founders strove for noble ideals, they were men, and men don't always live up to the ideals.  To believe that the Founders are any better than men today is to debase the nobleness of humanity.  It is our flaws and our attempts to overcome those flaws that make man who he is.    I agree that the current United States of America isn't exactly what the Founders had in mind when they created this country.  I believe that at ratification, many States believed in the idea of nullification or the ability to leave the Union.  Until the Civil War, the US was referred to as 'These United States' rather than "The United States".  These ideas are incapable with a nation, and were these ideas allowed to be put into effect, the United States would have quickly dissolved into separate countries, and there would be no Constitutional ideals to bemoan the loss of.  The Founders didn't and couldn't envision today's modern society any more than we can accurately foresee the challenges of the future.  They made a living document that could change with the times.  They made a system of government that would respond to the demands of the public, but put into place safeguards against radical changes.  It is because of this that the US is the longest Republic in existence.  They wouldn't have wanted America to stay stagnate, but rather to grow and prosper.    As to your question 'Will the South Rise Again', I must say no.  There will be no separatist movement that will gain widespread support like the succession of 1861.  The states are too interdependent to be able to survive as separate countries.  With the expansion of the 'Global Economy', I could foresee a reorganization of the US into a contintenal organization or world organization.  I can think of no scenario that leads to the South becoming another country.|`|FC0EMcZ1aa	I don't believe it will.     They have some of the lowest public school graduation rates in the south. Without education.. its nearly impossible.     And I'm not saying that everyone in the south is uneducated. But there are a lot according to a research site I found.|`|mQMCChWRaa	I think no living person who has any amount of power would even know what living and dying for beliefs means. And frankly, I think it's pure arrogance to use the smae tired cliches to try and rally the righteous to any particular side. All the states make one country; if *ya'll* don't understand that, I think that's where your problem starts. Instead, it looks like most states are only concerned about themselves and even antagonistic about other states.     Maybe you need to be clear about what you mean by "rise". Do you even know? Or is it another one of those cliches that everyone uses but no one questions, like "bleed for". When it comes to overused statements like that, everyone thinks they get the drift, but we hear them so often we don't stop to think about exactly what we're saying. "Rise" in what manner? No really, what? Do you even know what made the South worth living in, why it was "great"? Do you know if you'd even like the South like that? With plantations again? Is that all? Because that's pretty dim.    Do you mean economic stability? Well that would be up to the people who have the influence and means to put jobs and viable industries in your area, which I don't thik is done too much right now. Do you mean having people of distinction? Well frankly, your education is around third-world grade. Again, those who could change it, either the people in charge or the populace rising up, have not. Really, if everyone in the south looked around and said, "This sucks. I'm doing it myself," things might change.     The mindset of a place can be felt through its culture. Is there a common, shared culture? Because I see a bunch of "us vs. them", both between southerners themselves and between southerners and everyone else. Maybe it's time to stop slapping labels on things and people. You're Americans; it's not like you're going to forget you live in the south, and who even *uses* terms that are 2 centuries old? Maybe the South can't rise because it's too busy lying in the grave of "what has been".    In short, the South needs to decide what it wants and needs, and make a plan to do it itself. I think the southerner "culture" will not help in that resepect. I think those who laud it are caught up in a fuzzy, impressionistic ideal of how history was in a romanticized era that really wasn't perfect at all. I mean, you see poor people in filthy clothes talking about the south rising; what if it did? Do they really think someone would walk around handing all the white people the keys to mansions with money-making crops all ready to go? Gimme a break. The south was like any other western culture centre; there were a very few rich, a few more merchant, and most people were POOR.    This answer isn't cruel, it's realistic. I've been to the south. It has really nice places and some of the nicest people. But it has filthy secrets, a lax government, a culture of antagonism between races, and an uncaring populace. Nothing on earth will change that before the people there all decide they want it to change. Personally, I think extreme poverty, lack of access to any reasonable amount of education, and fear all make people feel hopeless. If you feel there *is* no up, why would you even try to go there?    If everyone in the south put down their toys, tools, guns, car keys and cellphones one day and walked to every government house and said, "**** it. We're doing it ourselves," things would change. It's people that change, not things. It's just a matter of what it will take to change enough people to get things moving. Inertia needs to start somewhere.|`|ZGHRWuJOaa	Actually, the war was about slavery, the south wanted new states to decide if they would be slave state or free state, the north was willing to tolerate slavery, but only with a balance of admitting a slave state and a free state at the same time. The south broke away because they did not want the Federal government deciding what area can and can not have slaves, so they called it a battle for states rights.  As far as the south rising again, I think that is the Republican party. They are mainly white landowners who are opposed to equal rights, want to limit womens rights (abortion) and want to limit the rights of people different than them (gay marriage)   Thats sounds a lot like the south that you miss so much from pre-civil war days. They also sound like they have a lot in common with those 'Axis of Evil' countries, I guess in their eyes its not bad if its good ol boys limiting your rights.|`|094e296fa929099f24fd8f51a81082eaaa	It seems a strong possibility.    The nation is getting more and more polarized, and both extremes think they are defending the vision of the nations forefathers.    The eventual outcome will of course be the destruction of the Constitution; face it, a nation like America only exists as long as it's population is willing to accept the rule of the majority, and the number of opinionated, self-centered Americans is on the rise. Perhaps even reaching critical mass.    If America splits, I can see the South forming as a union of sorts, a nation built on the principles of prejudice, racism, oppression. Don't think that I'm being cruel, your south will only be one of many such countries.    You see, there is a sad, but basic truth about society. The more moral your become, the more tolerant, educated, and secure a culture becomes, the less willing it is to fight dirty, and a country that has become moral will eventually fall to foes willing to kill women and children, use schools and hospitals to hide in, and blow themselves up to win.    Today, that tends to be the third worlders, but how long before pro-lifers are blowing themselves up in abortion protests, how long before environmentalists decide the 'cause' is worth killing dozens, hundreds, thousands?    Could be years, could be days, but it's coming.    And when it does, then yes, your South might rise again.    And yes, much of the Civil War WAS about slavery. A lot of soldiers fought (and died) over that very issue, and the South was very clear that their dislike of Lincoln, which triggered the whole thing, was due to their fear he would outlaw it.    States rights is indeed an issue, but to assume the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery is foolish at best, and intentionally rewriting history at it's worst.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	I'd say the answer is no.|`|AA10030912	Why should it. Lincoln finished that war. :)|`|2tmwOIxoaa	The short answer is no.     The south lost for a variety of reasons too numerous to go into here.  So now we have people like you who continue the fable of what the south was, it wasn't and what a new south could be, it could not.    People have voted for this type of government for the last 60 years.  What makes you think anything will change.  There are too many stakeholders in this type of government and society in general to want to change anything.  There are small concessions here and there but for the most part people want to be taken care of.   That is why we have the government we do.

4mylBh7Haa	from 700 to 500 BC was a period of the changing politics of Athens. It essentially went from an aristocracy of Kings and 4 'royal tribes' to democracy by the implementation of successive reforms over a number of years by various statesmen though true democracy would not be fully implemented until after 500 B.C. and as well would not last very long due to the Pelopponesian war with Sparta.    Two important people during this time were Draco, who appointed a strict law code and from whom we derive the term 'draconian', and his successor and well admired Solon who mandated a new constitution in 594 BC. After Solon more reforms followed which freed up trade and commerce, making Athens very wealthy and granting it a large middle class, abolishing slavery as a punishment for debts, and a formation of 4 main classes to which the lowest and most common, the Thetes, were for the first time granted political rights allowing them to vote, though only upper class was allowed to hold political office.|`|5VRGXQBAaa	Hey!

At the time of your actual reading, seek your friend's face and recite your poem just as if you were back at home rehearsing in front of him/her.     Otherwise, just pick a picture or object in the back of the room, behind your classmates, and focus solely on that while you recite your poem.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Grapes of Wrath is a novel published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. It is frequently read in American high school and college literature classes. A celebrated Hollywood film version, starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, was made in 1940; however, the endings of the book and the movie differ greatly.    Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now Monte Sereno, California. Set during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers, the Joads, driven from their home by drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agriculture industry. In a nearly hopeless situation, they set out for California's Central Valley along with thousands of other "Okies" in search of land, jobs, and dignity.    http://www.paperstarter.com/grapesofwrat...    http://www.bookrags.com/The_Grapes_of_Wr...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/gow/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grapesofwr...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/TheGrapesofWra...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...

Vwpky8wDaa	Start out local and work your way up. Most management/aritsts may want to listen to your beats with reference vocals or hooks on them to hear their "hit potential". Unfinished products being submitted most likely won't get heard. Make sure that your Myspace/SoundClick/Youtube are getting heavy traffic, this way they can see that you are on demand. Create a press-kit for yourself and once you get some solid songs down, try getting local some airplay. If your artist gets heard, you get heard. If your artist gets a deal, you get a deal.     It's also about who you know... so start networking! Most companies do not accept unsolicited material. There are lots of aspiring producers out there and only few make the cut....remember that they only care about making hit songs. So make sure your beats are nothing short of perfection.

VhJq2F5Caa	I have a feeling you are talking about kissing or something along those lines. and whether you are or are not, it doesn't matter. but the answer is that nothing you do you forget, really. just you might need a tad practice to get to the level you were before.    if it requires skill or balance, you slowly lose that.  such as skateboarding.    if its just an inherit skill, then you don't ever really forget it. in fact you knew it your whole life. like kissing.    and for the kissing matter if it involves another person, you can't be bad at it, as that person and you have different views on the same ordeal, and will either like the way the other one does it or won't. compromises can be made and it will get worked out. or no one will agree and you either have an accommodator or you give it up and move on.    As for mastering it, it depends yet again.    skills will always have room for improvement, and the older you are the longer it takes to do so. (except skills like patience, which is natural in life)    as for inherent skills, well your a master at all times.    and for the ones that involve other people, the only way to master that skill, is when you and that person do it together and its perfected together. like kissing.    kissing was the most g-rated thing i could put in that situation.  and a quote that you've heard "practice makes perfect"  is WRONG    you can practice bad habits.    so rather it should be "perfect practice makes perfect"|`|mXUKca6naa	...when rusty...  ...your technique is slower...  after continued practice and conditioning...  ...very fluid,comfortable with less (wasted) energy, time and doubt...  ...good luck...|`|EPe2p55Eaa	then hire a chauffeur solve my problem. all bosses dun drive. hee hee and i am one of them.

And why do people say that you are "rusty"?    I do think it depends on what it is - and the reason why you are not able to do it.|`|m9KRdETTaa	Then I suggest that you pay no attention to that quote and refer to the quote "Taking baby steps."|`|AA10043175	First remove all doubt that you can never master it.  Then get the bike out of storage, dust it off, oil the moving parts until most of the rust is gone.  Remember your mantra I can do this.  Check the air in the tires.  You do not want to be over-blown, but riding flat might be worse.  Locate a smooth level place and adjust the height of the seat.  (Yes, it will make your posterior look fat, but don't worry, you do not need to look at it).  Have an experienced rider check the height of the training wheels and the tension on the wheel spokes).  Check the chain guard or roll up your pant leg.  Repeat your mantra again and pedal, starting slowly.  Stay on the pavement, avoiding gravel, chuck holes, water, motorized vehicles, pedestrians and other cyclists.  Practice often.    Take time to stop before waving to old friends.    Simile?   Oh, poop.  In that case you can still find a way to master it, but you are on your own.  You can do it.|`|AA10112320	Can you still find a way to master it?     Yes. The secret is (1) practice and (2) enjoying it, which is equally important. If you don't (2), you'll soon get tired of practicing.    As for the bike simile... just think of another one that does apply to you.

It is the multitude of middle class people that are unhappy.  They suffer from 'expetionitus'.  The disease of wanting more than you are worth.  Nothing for a sixpence and very little for a pound.  It is all hard work.  Peace.|`|erCDPtYgaa	We measure our lives throgh our endeavors in fighting for our dreams/passion and what we believe in. That is the value of our lives.  Our value cannot be put on the same weighing scale with wealth. One can be happy even though one is in poverty and be happy when they are wealthy too. In fact, unlike most people think, a wise person will see that wealth and happiness has no correlation.     Of course one will think that they will attain happiness if they have wealth but one's life will be full of sadness if we see wealth as our ticket to happiness.    If we engage in what we love(career/family/arts/learning) and take care of oursleves and people we love, spiritual value/wealth will come to us in form of experience, trust, health, realtionships and wisdom. Wealth is only a gift that passes by.    Manythings in the world if not all are priceless.

DjWBGF4caa	By science, you could just look up the word in a dictionary but I have the thought that your prof/teacher is looking for more. It's really a two part question isn't it?    The nature of space/ the universe/ all that isn't in our heads.  The nature of time/ the thought process/ all that concerns us.    What is here? I would venture to say that the universe is objective.  What is now? I would say here that proper thinking takes a certain methodology.    The universe: Of utmost importance. (Cosmic)  The mind: It is only relative to each situation. (Technology)    All I can say then is that Science is the most important tool for gaining knowledge. Or cosmic technology.    It really depends if the prof is looking for a philosophical or calculative answer.     As for critical spirit, I hadn't heard that before, but it's really the same thing. The universe is critical and the mind is spirited. So again, science is how you define the outside world visa vi the inside world.     It's all about commodityy and you're what's for dinner, so to speak.    What is everyone else in relation to yourself? Another and another and yet, another...  What is yourself in relation to everyone else?  The being which you are most focused upon.    So I'd say critical spirit is akin to saying that science is a populated (growth and sustainably) mass cause (ultimate reason)...    Taken as an all - Science is a most important tool of cosmic technology for the growth and sustainability of ultimate reasoning. Ostensibly, it is also a meaning generator. The Over Mind. The oracle of truth or simply put, science is really All-we-have.
FaX8awk1aa	what are your views on the purpose of Man during a stable government?
0LgpcOBDaa	Yes, it is basically all in the exposure, however, some thought and planning are needed to pull it off well. You need a camera with a B setting. If all you have is up to 30 seconds, this may work as well.    Gather equipment. Small laser pointers, mini mag lights and LED key chain like lights. Get different colors if you can find them or find colored plastic filter material to change some of the colors.    Place camera on a tripod or other sturdy support. Have a dark room or go outside at night. Have someone trip the camera (start the exposure) and you start to paint objects with your light(s). If you keep moving you will not be seen but your light will.    You can out line objects in the room with the lasers, "spray paint" objects with the mini mag lights as well as the LED key chain lights. By pointing a pin point light source towards the camera you CAN write your name and stuff like your writing on a chalk board, just remember to keep moving and turn the light off between things.    Being digital, you can see your results as soon as you try them, adjusting things as you go and see fit. Start with a ISO of 100 and move up if more sensitivity is needed.    Going to a over look of a busy highway and doing the same thing (with out YOUR lights) will get the cars as streaks as they wind around the road. If your camera can go longer then 30 seconds you may want to stop down a bit to 5.6 or maybe even 8, but again, it's digital and you can see your shots "right now" and adjust things as needed.    Good luck    Bob - Tucson

a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	At times I feel like an attic cluttered with old picture frames,   broken knick-knacks, and dusty books.  My past haunts me in the same way  a rogue wave comes in the dark night,   sinking my spirit like the last skip of a stone across a pond.    My family says its all just rubbish.    Dont think like a bowl of oatmeal!  You have the gift of love and creativity.     A Mona Lisa fondly watching Leonardo paint, I think to myself.    A fantasy of mine is to fly high and free like the swallows.  But then my mind goes back to the attic, and wonder which frame Mona would like.  In some ways my life is just a tiny point of light at the end of a dark tunnel.    But, that light is hope and joy.  So I walk through that tunnel filled with the cobwebs of memories.  I know I will encounter rocks  and wooden beams that try to trip me.  But, I will persevere even when the shadows try to engulf me again.  --------------------------------------...

Why don't you just pick up a spray paint can and write "JEWS IZ BAD" on the nearest wall, since that it basically the point you want to get across.    The Jews as a people spread all across Europe and were excellent craftsman, musicians, financiers, and merchants.   When the king did something stupid and needed a scapegoat, he blamed the Jews and had them all killed.  Yet their culture remain intact for 3000 years.    The reason you don't see the Jews as a people in history as much is because they never had a state until recently.    And the Arab neighbors, even when the Israelis tried to make peace with them, did things like launch suprise attacks on Yom Kippur.    So to answer your question, yes, the Jews did do something good.  They beat the crap out of every crooked, racist, ignorant Arab hate-monger that tried to deny them statehood. 1948, 1967, 1973.  They made Arab armies look like the Special Olympics version of armed forces.

erCDPtYgaa	You are right, there is no absolute good or evil.  That is why there are so many unique people in the world. Everyday we are bombarded by uncertainties of choices and decisions.     One good cannot be weighed with another good. For example, you are in a collapsing building, and you have to save either your mother or 2 small children. Objectively, the greater good is to save 2 lives right? But ethically and emotionally, your mom is the one who bore you, change your diapers, fed you and endured all you wants, educated you. So which is the greater good? Of course, if you stand there and calculate who to save you are ...    What can we do? It is an ethical dilemma.     We cannot compare goodwills. Clashes of interests are inevitable, therefore we have to learn to compromise for the needs of others(That is growing up).     Contrary to popular belief that the fittest survive and competition is the rule of thumb in life, blind competition ultimately blinds our heart and distort our needs. We should always compete with ourselves and learn to work together with others through trust. Nature won't put us to a dead end. There are always way to work out of a dilemma if we can enlighten our minds and see the core of every problems on our lives. There is always alternatives and innovative solutions to problems. Our brains and body are our partners remember?     For trust to work we have to contribute to the real needs of others and not wants.    To work through the dilemma of terrorism/conflict/crimes/illness, can we remove them forcefully and think that it is solved? They are manifestaitons of an implicit societal problem which stems back to the core of human nature. i.e. They are symptoms, can removing the symptom solve anything? For example, a brutal murder/incest takes place in a famly and the father is convicted. Everyone is grief-stricken and wants the legislation to hang this father. Sounds just? Think again. Is it just to solve the roots of the problems itself or just to quell our vengeful hearts and make us feel better?    The key is to be true to oursleves for we stand for what ethics we believe in and differentiate b/w symptoms and roots of the problems.    Well, this is what I believe in, it is up to you to judge.|`|wZH6PBIGaa	Philosophically, I think in short, it's impossible to have a universal definition of good and evil which everyone could agree on. Why? Because everyone would have to agree. Our views of what is right and wrong are distorted by our own prejudices, greed, and hypocrisy.  Some things are more readily agreed on than others. For example, few would condone cold-blooded murder. Or rape. These are things which obviously cause harm. Other are much more gray - stealing sweets from a shop, homosexuality, downloading pirated music, watching films on the internet, little 'white lies'.  The more clear cut 'evils' are where force is most often used, because more people agree, and there is a stronger feeling against them.  I think evil can only be definitively described as an action which causes harm. To anyone, including the perpetrator. This doesn't have to be direct, it can even be thoughts which could lead to actions, or corrupt one's thinking.  Back to your point though, I don't think there is a point that one good not press against the good of another, because as I said before, people disagree. And there can be no definitive line or point where something becomes good or evil, for this very reason.  Good and Evil are universal concepts, and thus can only really be explained by your last statement! They must come from an outside source of authority greater than that of the individuals.  All then that we can claim to judge on our own, is majority verdicts, a sort of natural selection of the moral world - survival of the most popular.|`|m9KRdETTaa	Right goes wrong if you turn into a dead end, and that is the answer beyond good and evil.|`|AA11635601	As you settle down in life, if love ever visits, you discover that those answers reside inside us all, and contrary to what you might expect, are universal among all loving people.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	if there is not absolute good and evil, then what's the F u are saying that u are right? since there is not absolute right and wrong too what. imao...Paper talk only, yuck!|`|fd1n9LoBaa	"You see, because without bad, there is no good.

Evil is good. "  -Eddie Murphy, Vampire in Brooklyn.      If you want a humanistic answer it can be very broad.        "At what point are we able to judge another man's good as our evil, and furthermore, use force to correct them? "    Its hard to answer, Terrorists think blowing themselves up and taking innocent lives with them is good.  We on the other hand think this is evil.  Use force to correct them?

ExluLxQyaa	Scarlett and Rhett were soul-mates.  Absolutely, no doubt about it.  They are the same.  Scarlett's mother died when Scarlett was just a teen - she had to cope with her "true love" marrying another woman, the war had begun, and her new husband, whom she could care less for, had just died of pneumonia.  She believed she loved Ashley, because Ashley had flirted with her for years, leading her on, making her believe he felt something more than just lust.  Rhett was right. Scarlett would have never been happy with Ashley - they were completely different people; whereas Rhett and Scarlett were the same inside.  Scarlett was her mother's favorite, I believe, and she was spoiled, so of course she was selfish. And thank God she was or she may not have made it through the war - she was a shrewd businesswoman, intelligent (more than people think), independent, confident, and assertive - she had everything she needed to survive that war and carry her family to safety with her.  Ashley was a southern gentleman and, frankly, there were enough of those.  Scarlett needed a real man and that was Rhett.|`|irPhrsGraa	I got the book the other day, after watching the film. Yes, I think that scarlett and Rhett were meant to be. I'm not to keen on Scarlett- I think shes a bit of a user and is more concerned about how she looks prior to how other people feel. Melanie and Ashley were meant for each other. Mel is my favorite character.    No I do not think Scarlett was meant to be with Ashley. Ashley is with mel. Scarlett should be with Rhett. I think that Ashley is a bit of a user actually. He leads Scarlett on when in love with Mel. And then he KISSES her! Can't he stick to one girl?      I think that Scarlett and Rhett were meant to be- as you said. Rhett is a completely different character to what I expected him to be, and he showed Scarlett's sweeter side. It also showed her need to have someone with her.    I overall think that the book is a tale of family comfort, love, and desperation. I really like the book, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a long read.    I didn't know that there was a sequel! Thank you!
s6Sl47Q4aa	Hi    For more details you need to check out Nuremberg Trials , Here is the link from Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_t...     I am fan of WW II and I think this link summarize it|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Most who were brought to court were tried at Nuremberg and then executed by hanging. Others like Martin Boorman and Josef Mengele escaped to South America (an idea explored by Ira levin in The Boys from Brazil). Some were given amnesty in return for their work on rocket technology (at Peenemunde) to eventually help the US with their space programme. Hitler and Goebbels committed suicide in the bunker in Berlin, Goering commited suicide at Nuremberg awaiting trial, Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hoess was imprisoned in Spandau prison in Berlin where he eventually died, and Albert Speer, architect and armaments minister was released - the only one to apologise for the Nazi crimes.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Without taking up too much of my time I'll correct the misstatements here.    1. Marvin Bormann committed suicide at the site of the Lehrter bridge station. He was part of the second breakout group that left during the night of May 1st 1945. Construction crews discovered a skeleton with what appeared to be a glass cylinder between it's teeth in 1972. He was positively identified by dental records.     2. Minster Speer'- It is now known for a fact that practically everything Speer told the Tribunals was a masterfully spun web of lies-to save his own skin. His tearful testimony about his attempt to murder the Fuhrer by inducing mustard gas into the bunker was an incredible acting job. Of all the sad history of the tribunals this stands out as an example their inability to understand the Nazi's and their commitment to the Reich. Today, listening to the transcripts, it is hard to understand why they believed him and his "apology" is so lurid and uninspiring most now believe this was the preceptor of some kind of deal made backstage.      3. Josef Mengele-No solid proof, one way or the other,is known about the Doctor.    4. The entire intelligence apparatus of 102 men and 2 women(Including Muller) were somehow whisk out of besieged Berlin on April 24th 1945 by the American special opp's units. Muller was seen in Baltimore in 1948 but never again. The fate of the rest is known but sealed.    5. The only way to get truthful information about the Tribunals is to visit the Archives in a now free and united Germany. Anything(on the Internet) that is not connected to the Archives by acknowledgments is not proper source material and can't be believed or used without footnoted exceptions pertaining to the listed volumes ie NTP.    It serves no interest to discuss the Tribunals without access to the records themselves as source material.      s_e_s|`|9OsOeG53aa	Do a Google for Nuremberg, that where the trials were held.

Most Nazi scientists were taken to the US to work in US government projects. Google Operation Paperclip.  The larger number was given visas and passports to escape via the "rat lines" to South America (Mengele, Eichmann, Barbie, etc.). Years later, Barbie and Eichmann were found and taken to Europe to be tried. Mengele's body was supposedly found in a Brazilian river. Google "rat lines" and Odessa Files.

8asG4WCwaa	Probably their middle to late 30s.  Many authors do not start writing publishable work until after they have "settled down" in life - married or divorced, kids are school age, job is secure, they have time to write, etc.     Of the author's whose biographies I have read, all but one followed this pattern. It is also possible that the average age differes by genre, too (some genres I don't bother much with).    I wonder if such information has been collected?  I would think so (I don't recall ever running across in my research, though) but where would one look for the information (way too many statistic sites, even in the publishing trade links).

Dramatic Irony    https://sheehy-english.wikispaces.com/Ir...|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I don't see anything ironic about that sentence or about the entire letter, which is right on the money.  Somehow, Artemidorus knows the who, what, when, and where of the conspiracy and is ready to warn Caesar of it.  Any irony involved occurs in the next scene, when Artemidorus tries to present the warning to Caesar.  His insistence that it's vitally important to Caesar personally only causes Caesar to put it aside, saying that a message that touches him personally must take a back seat to the concerns of others  So it's ironic that Artemidorus' pleas for Caesar to read the message have the opposite effect, and it's ironic that Caesar's display of magnanimity contributes to his death.

Doing experiments with live-humans like x-raying them in their privates and all sorts of things are UGLY memories. I'm so glad we have peace here in the U.S. and an army that cares so much about our freedom and well-being. Any human is a human no matter what religion we are, what color we are, etc we are all the same from the inside. Hitler was the devil himself in human form. I wish he didn't commit suicide or dye, but instead was punished by the surviving Jews with the worst beating of his life until he was unconscious and then killed in the electric chair to learn not to mess around with human kind.

Every culture has participated in some form of brutality and I am sick of hearing about it. Germans are always demonized for it. Remember Stalin? You wanna talk numbers? At the end of the day Stalin killed more than Hitler. His starvation of the Ukrainians killed at least 5 million people. Do we ever hear of this? No. The Russians don't have to have it constantly blown in their face. On a smaller scale there Africans are massacring each other but for the most part it is forgotten.    I think that's just tough for people who are so scarred by the holocaust. See the bigger picture and put it in context. Nazi's killed 10 million of whom 6 million were Jews. A number cannot be placed on how many the Soviets killed but it is undisputed that it was more. Undisputed! Ask a History Professor.

It was about shame, control, callous, and cold hearted killers.  They experimented on pregnant women and children.  I recently met a woman in Europe, in Assisi, Italy.  She went into a gift store and thanked the descendant of the man who saved her life from the Nazis.  She showed her mark to us.  Old and beautiful she told her story to everyone in the store.

elhxTNg2aa	The play in Hamlet was used to expose what had happened in the real world.    Hamlet suspected his uncle of killing his father, marrying his mother and claiming the throne. So in Hamlet's play, he had the king's brother kill the king (in the same way he suspected his uncle had killed his father), marrying the queen and gaining the crown. Hamlet's uncle reacted to the play in a way that made it clear to Hamlet that his uncle was guilty.    Shakespeare was using the play as a clever plot device, but he may also have been showing how art can become a powerful commentary on current events. Obviously, as a playwright, this was something that Shakespeare believed in.    HBJ|`|DvToP5h7aa	Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.    Act III, Scene ii    ?

Instead, they should use their discretion to build up suspense with their actions.    ? Most importantly, they shouldnt be tempted to get a cheap laugh, as this is applauded by the most foolish members of the audience and might drown out the important parts.

His ultimate goal was a play within a play within a play, but he died before it was realized.    Or.    Hamlet wanted to see how Claudius reacted to the murder scene in the play. If Claudius freaked out and showed guilt (if it reminded him of his murder), then Hamlet would know whether the ghostly Old Hamlet was being truthful or not.

But I guess the best book I WILL ever read is mid...sun ( I can't remember the name xD) It's Edwards Twilight ^^
mxtWuadraa	Personally, I loved the ending!! I loved all the books! Especially Breaking Dawn. Don't be influenced by other peoples opinions.. just read them and make up your own mind! Although I do agree with you when you say that people who weren't into it in the beginning were disappointed.. But that's just because they haven't given the books a chance!!     Enjoy the rest of Eclipse and make sure you read Breaking Dawn (it is the best by far!!!!)|`|6PSFH4eKaa	NO I loved the ending of the series. although, I wish there was another book after BD|`|h4pRIT0Zaa	*spoiler warning*  she spends pretty much half the book building up tension to this huge fight. And the fight doesn't happen. It's just lame. Honestly. If there had been an epic fight then it would've saved the already crappy plot twist.      End of eclipse was great btw. Well sort of. Bella was a bit lame and boring and annoying and stupid and generally retarded. But i alwalys found bella lame and boring, the cullens and the minor characters were the reason i read the books.|`|DYdXrVVeaa	yes|`|FF9mMlgKaa	no the whole series is disappointing, the end is the best part, because then it's over.|`|VwJ7o3ORaa	I loved the end of Breaking Dawn, although I'm sad to see the saga end. I think a lot of the people were annoyed with the huge climax and then the fall.|`|irPhrsGraa	well, it depends on your opinion. I thought the ending was brilliant. It made me cry that it was over! Breaking Dawn is my favorite part of the series. I'm not going to make the decision for you, but, don't be judged by other peoples opinions. Make your own! Anyway, I hope your enjoying the books. ry Harry Potter too, that's a good Fantasy book.|`|6EJTwU4aaa	i think i was alittle dissapointed but it is still good!  and the end of eclipse was fine i had no problems with it : )     for breaking dawn:   i thought there was'nt enough drama (dramas...kinda bad its what makes a good book!)  with final books likes harry potter there was alot of tradgedy and thats why they're books that can be seen as real classics     but it doesnt matter what others think its really your opinion that matters   happy reading : )|`|kI8T2iCraa	The ending was horrible, but no more than the rest of it...    Don't want to spoil it for you, but since you asked... the last chapter is entitled "The Happily Ever After". It not only lacks originality, but it also distorts the commonly used phrase, rendering it lame and quite frankly, retarded. Yup, major let-down. I thought after four books she'd finally wow us, but no, didn't do it for me. I think if I were still fourteen or fifteen, I may have reacted differently. It's not for adults, that's for sure. It's just too lovey-dovey. No grown woman would buy that.    That last book should not have been written period. The whole thing was a huge disaster if you ask me. She should have just quit while she was ahead, or at least, while her readers' IQs were still reasonably high.|`|DK3zY3mkaa	i love all the books  and yes it was disappointing that it ended    i want more books! lol.|`|D3iRyzdJaa	omg i loved the books and the end is totally not disapointing it is so good you have to finish it to understand and if you have liked the books so far you will most likely love the ending.so just continue with it and it is really amazing i freaking love the twilight saga!!!!|`|ZSesESvOaa	Yes it is really that bad but if you liked the second book you might not be disappointed. I really enjoyed book one and book three I thought I was going to die reading the second one and I was stuck in a rehab center with a bunch of old people trying to recover from a broken hip. I was way bored and that should have been exciting.  I enjoyed Eclipse but was very disappointed by where the focus was in the fourth book. I don't want to give away too much but they build up to a fight scene or at least something really exciting but I was let down and the first half of the book could have been condensed into a few chapters.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Some people loved it, others felt there was not a strong enough climax.    Personally, I was disappointed.|`|QBheEJ77aa	no! its really good but i wish she didnt end it cus now der wont b any books. it happy cus....well i wont spoil it!!! ask if u wanna no tho.    it gudd xoxox|`|Ysnbesz4aa	I'm about 7 chapters away from the ending of Breaking Dawn and refuse to finish it because I'm afraid of being disappointed.....plus, that means no more Edward :(|`|0WKkXIyKaa	The end was disappointing .. like the whole franchise.

4qVXodtnaa	You don't say how old you are, whether you have any experience, where you live etc.    Without this information, this makes this question much harder to answer.    You don't need an agent right from the start, only once you have loads of experience. Get into a local theatre and start performing in their plays - you never know, there may well be an agent in the audience undercover.    If you aren't spotted, then you need to send your headshot and resume/CV out to several different agencies (do your research here - try googling 'Talent Agency *Rough area around where you live*). The agent may request an interview with you, they may not.    Online talent agencies usually aren't legit, but there are a few casting call websites I know of, which also advertise agencies!    ^Mail me for more info^    Hope I helped!

AA12078704	Of course it does not refer to a male... Shakespeare wrote this poem for one of his sweethearts:    Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,  And summer's lease hath all too short a date:  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,  And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;  And every fair from fair sometime declines,  By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;  But thy eternal summer shall not fade  Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;  Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,    In those lines Shakespeare actually compares his lover to nature and concludes that she is even more beautiful. He also points out that beauty perishes because of time. However, he assures his lover that as far as she is concerned he shall not allow that to be the case. He writes this poem, in order to make her immortal through art. Now that she is at her best, he wants to capture her beauty and make it eternal. That is why he says in last three lines that,   "When in eternal lines to time thou growest" (meaning that even though time shall pass these lines shall not perish)    "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see," (in order for them read the poem obviously)    "So long lives this and this gives life to thee." (So long shall this poem live and give life to his sweetheart, whose beauty will be remembered).|`|hQEpKwtPaa	i think it is talking about a man, though i cant quite work out why...      shakespeare? gay? bi?|`|VIaOQmUtaa	For a modern look at no 18 read this version  http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/boo...
ceBTTCPwaa	Sonnet 18, often alternately titled Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?, is one of the best-known of 154 sonnets written by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Part of the Fair Youth sequence (which comprises sonnets 1-126 in the accepted numbering stemming from the first edition in 1609), it is the first of the cycle after the opening sequence now described as the Procreation sonnets. Most scholars now agree that the original subject of the poem, the beloved to whom the poet is writing, is a male, though the poem is commonly used to describe a woman.  In the sonnet, the poet compares his beloved to the summer season, and argues that his beloved is better. The poet also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.  The poem starts with a line of adoration to the beloved"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" The speaker then goes on to say that the beloved being described is both "more lovely and more temperate" than a summer's day. The speaker lists some things that are negative about summer. It is too short"summer's lease hath all too short a date"and sometimes the sun shines too hot"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." However, the beloved being described has beauty that will last forever, unlike the fleeting beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever by the power of his written words. The hope is that the two lovers can live on, if not through children, then through the poems brought forth by their love which, unlike children, will not fade.|`|frSL3zNAaa	hmm we did this in school so frm my notes it says..    Sonnets 1-17 tried to persuade the young man to have children, thus ensuring his beauty lasts forever. Sonnet 18 makes the bold claim that it is poetry that will make young man immortal.   it makes the assertion that the mans 'loveliness' surpasses that of a summers day,  lines 3-8 describe the brevity of summer in way that everything beautiful (fair) will eventually decay.   lines 9-14 claim that verse will make certain that the mans beauty lives long as humanity itself. faith in the power of poetry is in contrast to the earlier sonnets.  Sonnet 18 has been described as 'sincere and emotionally truthful' and 'boastful and over exaggerated'     My notes kinda don't make sense even to me, but i hope that helped somehow :)
hPkWZh3xaa	I would say try it.  My co-ordination is crap on piano, because I can't get my right and left hands not to move in the same way just like you.  But violin is different for me and I don't have that problem.  So just try and see how you get on - nothing to lose :)|`|O05HQLohaa	The most difficult thing about you learning the violin is going to be getting over the idea, that you can't do it.  If you can tie your shoes, one hand holding the string while another makes a loop or a knot, you are doing two different things with your hands.|`|uDUk0SCEaa	You know what? It's going to be hard to learn the violin.     But not because your hands naturally do two different things - simply because learning any new skill is difficult. You have to build new neural pathways and practice them so they become natural. This means that before you learn the skill, you can't perform the skill. It doesn't become easy until you learn it.    I know that sounds totally silly, but that's the way it is. When I was small, I would always get overwhelmed with any new task. I still get that feeling often, but there are some steps to learning:    1 - you know there is something you want to learn  2 - you start to learn it  3 - you CAN DO IT!  4 - you can do it automatically    This applies to EVERY learned skill. But you learned to walk and talk, so I am guessing you have the basic mechanisms for learning.    The challenge of learning anything is always going to be different for different skills for different people, but if you want to learn it, and it is important to you, you will be able to learn it eventually.    I recently started trying to learn how to do a "5-finger tremolo" on the guitar. Because I learned to do a 3 finger tremolo first (and because my hand loves to do things differently than I tell it to), my hand REFUSED to do the correct order. It took me TWO WEEKS before I could do the motion even very slowly. After two more weeks I can do it at about half the speed of my 3 finger tremolo. In the last 3 days, I've seen a 50% increase in speed and I no longer have to concentrate on every single finger.    It will be the same for you with the violin.    Do some reading, find out how to do it correctly. Pay attention to every detail and begin as slow as you need to.    Be patient with yourself. No new skill will come to you overnight. And certainly not a complicated skill like the violin. As you learn more, you may find that improvement comes more slowly. Think of that as time to let the skills 'season' and really sink in.    Spend time reading as well as practicing. Be INTERESTED in the violin in general. If you are motivated, everything becomes easier.    Visualize yourself playing. Be specific. Visualize specific notes. Visualize bunches of notes. Be imaginative. Picture yourself from your own POV and others.    Practice regularly and often. Practicing for 15 minutes every 3 hours will probably do you a lot better than practicing for 3 hours every 5 days.    I like to put 15-30 minutes of practicing, then an hour of reading or watching stuff on youtube with my instrument at the ready to play.    Remember, you WILL learn. If you spend time doing it, you won't be able to stop yourself from learning. The pace at which you learn depends on your interest, the importance to you, the difficulty of the task and your natural pace of learning. As long as it is moving forwards, be satisfied with your results and you will be able to overcome any challenges that you face.|`|6ZMebqRaaa	If you practice, you can lear to play anything.
1hvrQYWiaa	'How,and in what ways,did Alexander's attitude to Oriental culture change  after the death of Darius,and how did this effect the attitude of his Macedonian followers towards him?'|`|AA10729675	I am sorry, Ammianus, it is not "effect", it is "affect".  Look it up in the dictionary.  A question could be:  Why did Alexander choose to dress like a Persian?  What did his officers think of this choice?    Now, one thing that is seldom mentioned about Alexander:  when he chose to wear Persian robes, he was already covered with wounds, some of them could have still been sore.  Were Persian robes more comfortable than the Macedonian attire?  And what was the Macedonian attire?  You must be prepared for those counter-questions.    Another point:  A. did not stay in Egypt long enough to be dressed as a Pharaoh.  But in Persia, he was 'king' we say.  In fact he was Shahenshah:  king of kings.  He was Shah of Persia.  As a king of Macedonia, he could dress like a Macedonian, but in front of the Persians, would it be possible that he would receive more respect if he dressed as a Shahenshah?  Is it possible that Persian robes were convenient both for the respect from the Persians (more numerous than the Greco-Macedonians) and for the comfort of the garments?

AA11763018	The First Red Scare: 1918-1920  After the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), for some derision turned to abiding hostility and fear.  The government's wave of arrests, deportations and trials during the period 1918-1920 is often referred to by historians as the "First Red Scare."      During World War II, however, both the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union promoted Russo-American friendship out of the need for a solid front against the Axis Powers.  With Hitler's defeat, then, came the mutual fear and rivalry that produced the new hostility of the Cold War era. American mainstream political culture saw Communist affiliation as fundamentally treasonous.    The Truman Loyalty Campaign  Under the demands of the Cold War's Truman Doctrine, the Truman Administration set up a Loyalty Campaign at home as well as funded anti-Communist efforts abroad.    The "Second" Red Scare: 1947-1954  Public anxiety increased dramatically in 1949 when Americans learned that the Soviet Union had successfully tested its first atomic bomb.  For the first time in recent American history, the United States faced a realistic threat from abroad.  Reaction was sharp and swift.  The government began investigating possible links between American Communists and the passing of U.S. atomic secrets to the Russians.  This led to a number of high-profile prosecutions, culminating in the conviction and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.      During the sensational Rosenberg trial, a flamboyant young prosecutor named Roy Cohn caught the eye of an ambitious U.S. Senator named Joseph McCarthy.  McCarthy recruited Cohn and the up-and-coming communist hunter became the Senator's chief of staff.  Before they were done, their partnership would cut quite a swath across the American political and social landscape.       Casting about for a sure-fire reelection theme, McCarthy settled on the hunt for Communist subversives.     The climate of fear and anxiety accompanying the growing Cold War rivalry with the now atomically-armed Soviet Union caused many Americans to give credence to any "danger" pointed out to them by an authority figure.|`|AA12346961	Any change is threatening to the "normal" people. Being a capitalistic society, the Americans feared the communists as it was the exact opposite of the capitalistic one that was the norm in America.  Capitalists believe in individual growth and development that brings about better social standards. The communists were against the individual growth. What was focussed on was forced equality.   The Americans were scared of this "mutant" social behavior of the communists. Not "normal" at all.|`|AA11791519	I'm not sure WHAT caused it--probably  politicians trying to get us to look away from what THEY were doing here at home--but I'll tell you one thing:  it made my childhood a living hell.

And, who'd' thunk it:  nuns were actually living the most "communistic" existence of them all.......|`|AA11339228	Since the wall fell in the '90's the US no longer feared communism, it had to find a new enemy, and it is named "fundamental Muslims."

AA11718036	The Invisible Man is a famous 1897 science fiction novel(la) by H.G. Wells. Some say it is a large short story, as implied in an introduction to the Bantam Classics edition. It is also commonly mistaken with the title to Ralph Ellison's novel, Invisible Man (1952).    Wells' novel was originally serialized in Pearson's Magazine in 1897 and published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man of the title is "Griffin", a scientist who theorizes that if a person's refractive index is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but becomes mentally unstable as a result.    In 2006 Graeme Milton at Utah University and Nicolae-Alexandru Nicorovici at Sydney University of Technology claimed to have worked out how to make a "cloaking device" to render objects invisible at certain frequencies of light. The cloaking device relies on recently discovered materials that have a negative refractive index, which effectively makes light travel backwards.   A Russian writer Yakov I. Perelman has pointed out in Physics Can Be Fun (1913) that from a scientific point of view, a man made invisible by Griffin's method should have been blind and helpless, since a human eye works by absorbing incoming light, not letting it through completely.|`|AA10838603	Yeah, I read it, it was pretty inane compared to some of the stuff written in the last 30 years.

AA11718036	The Counter Reformation    The Counter-Reformation or Catholic Reformation was a movement within the Roman Catholic Church to reform itself in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. The Catholic Reformation was comprehensive and comprised five major elements:    Doctrine   Ecclesiastical or Structural Reconfiguration   Religious Orders   Spiritual Movements   Political Dimensions   Such reforms included the foundation of seminaries for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life to returning orders to their spiritual foundations, and new spiritual movements focus on the devotional life and a personal relationship with Christ, including the Spanish mystics and the French school of spirituality.    The Protestant Reformation was a movement in the 16th century to reform the Catholic Church in Western Europe. The Reformation was started by Martin Luther with his 95 Theses on the practice of indulgences. In late October of 1517 he posted these theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, commonly used to post notices to the University community. In November he mailed them to various religious authorities of the day. The reformation ended in division and the establishment of new institutions: most importantly Lutheranism, the Reformed churches, the Calvinists the Anabaptists, and Anglicanism. It also led to the Catholic or Counter Reformation within the Roman Catholic Church through a variety of new spiritual movements, reforms of religious communities, the founding of seminaries, the clarification of Catholic theology as well as structural changes in the institution of the Church.|`|AA11293521	Well, this is of course quite a broad topic but the main message is very simple. Throughout Europe there was a rebirth of ideas and many new and different avenues of thinking. Either through the renaisance or through the reformation new ideas were coming together which were threating the dominant organization, the roman catholic church. In order to combat the newer influences from especially the reformation, there was a movement by catholic leadership to find a common ground and sure up some of the areas that the reformers were devling into. There was a strong desire to turn away and punish those who were being driven away from the catholics as a result of these new leaders and their teaching. The role of the church was beginning to change anyway as a result of the renaissance at large but the catholic church was looking to bring back the people leaving the church and fight the new ideas being proposed by those who found flaw within the church.

AA11718036	The Devil Wears Prada is a 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger about a young woman who, fresh from college, gets a job working as a personal assistant to a powerful fashion magazine editor that turns increasingly hellish as she struggles to keep up with her boss's capricious and demeaning requests.    A prime example of "chick lit," the novel was widely seen as a roman  clef about Vogue magazine and its iconic editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, since Weisberger worked there as an intern. Although she denies the story's editor is modeled on Wintour, many readers believed otherwise, propelling the book to the bestseller list.    A film based on the novel, starring Meryl Streep, Adrian Grenier and Anne Hathaway, will be released in summer 2006.    The novel begins with its main character, Andrea Sachs, stuck in midtown Manhattan traffic, trying to remember how to use a manual transmission. She has picked up the Porsche roadster that belongs to her boss, Runway magazine editor Miranda Priestly, from the shop. She must return it to Miranda's apartment in time for Miranda's family to go out to the Hamptons for the weekend. While she is attempting to do this, Miranda calls on her cell phone and excoriates her for not doing her job properly. She also tells her to pick up her pet French bulldog from the veterinarian's office. Trying to comply, Andrea ruins some of the expensive designer clothing she is wearing. She wishes Miranda would die. But if that did happen, she reminds herself, she'd lose the pleasure of killing Miranda herself.    In the next chapter we move back in time and learn how she got into this predicament. After graduating from Brown with a degree in English, she visited India with her boyfriend Alex Fineman and came down with amoebic dysentery. Recovered, she leaves her home in Avon, Connecticut for New York City. There she moves in with her longtime friend Lily, now doing graduate studies in Russian at Columbia, and looks for a job.    A longtime reader of The New Yorker, she blankets the magazine publishing industry with her rsum, hoping to land enough experience somewhere and eventually get a job at the prestigious weekly. Still not over her dysentery, she gets a surprise interview at the Elias-Clark group. Afterwards she is hired as Miranda's junior assistant. While she knows little of her, she is told repeatedly that "a million girls would die for your job."    That job is primarily doing personal errands for Miranda, who often mistakenly calls her Emily, after her predecessor who is now the senior assistant. Miranda is a classic "boss from hell"  she rarely gives enough information or time to comply with her demands, yet she routinely berates those who fail. She makes people go to great lengths to accommodate her only to change her mind after they have done so. She feels no compunction about ordering Andrea and others to do things such as getting coffee or lunch anew if they have gotten too cold for her in the meantime. People at the magazine are afraid of finding themselves alone in an elevator with her, or making critical remarks about her even to their close friends.    All the same, Andrea is told that if she manages to stick it out working for Miranda for a year, she can have her pick of jobs in the magazine industry, so she struggles onward. Even in the present, the perks aren't bad  between Runway's "Closet" of designer clothes ostensibly on loan for photo shoots but rarely returned and often "borrowed" by the staff and the general obsequy she encounters as Miranda Priestly's personal assistant, she is able to acquire enough free designer clothing to fit in better with the rest of the Runway staff. Eventually, she develops an appreciation for it and stops incurring Miranda's displeasure. She gets a Bang and Olufsen cell phone for free when Miranda doesn't want it, and learns that Elias-Clark's policies regarding expense accounts are rather lax, to the benefit of herself and her friends.    She also goes to parties with celebrities. At one of them she meets Christian Collinsworth, a Yale graduate who has been identified as the hot (in more ways than one) up-and-coming writer of his and her generation. They become attracted to each other, complicating her relationship with Alex.    The 14-hour days she puts in almost routinely leave her little free time to spend with him and Lily, who is increasingly turning to alcohol and picking up dubious men in order to relieve the pressures of graduate school. Her relationship with her family also begins to suffer. Her parents complain she isn't making time to visit her older sister, who is expecting her first child.    Matters finally come to a head when Emily gets mononucleosis and Andrea must take her place accompanying Miranda to the fashion shows in Paris. There, she has a surprise encounter with Christian. Later that night Miranda finally lets down her guard a little bit and asks Andrea what she's learned, and where she'd like to work afterwards. She promises to make some calls to people she knows at The New Yorker on Andrea's behalf once her year is up, and tells her she can actually do some small written pieces for Runway.    But back at the hotel she gets two urgent calls from Alex and her own parents saying that something has happened to Lily. She calls back and learns that Lily is comatose in the hospital after driving drunk and wrecking a car.    Though Andrea is receiving much subtle pressure from her family and Alex to return home, she tells Miranda she will honor the commitment. Miranda is pleased, and tells her that her future in magazine publishing is looking bright. At the Paris fashion show, however, a livid Miranda makes a demanding request of Andrea to update Caroline and Cassidy's passports to Paris, and Andrea finally realizes that her family is more important. She worries that she is becoming more and more like|`|AA11853820	Noone knows..they keep falling asleep.|`|AA10539411	euf........

Afraid she had been blacklisted for good from publishing, she remains in Connecticut for a while and works on short fiction. Seventeen buys one of her stories. She returns to New York and gives herself a comfortable financial cushion by selling all the designer clothing she took to Paris with her to consignment shops. At the novel's end, she is returning to the Elias-Clark building to discuss a writing position at another of the company's magazines, contrasting her treatment  "like I was someone who mattered"  to that of her replacement as Miranda's assistant.

If you like fantasy try the Dragon Jousters series by Mercedes Lackey.The first book 'Joust', is about Vetch a young serf who is rescued by a Dragon Jouster from his cruel master.He becomes a Dragon boy(one who takes care of dragons).Later he secretly hatches his own dragon.The later two books are about how he escapes to his native Alta and how the war between Alta and Tia ends.The setting is strongly Ancient Egyptian.

A fun and very easy way to begin is to get a beginning recorder book and a recorder and follow along.  You will be playing songs in treble clef from the first day and it will be very inexpensive.      If you really want to read all music, I would suggest the piano.  If you take lessons and practice, you will learn treble clef, bass clef and all of the music symbols.  A wind or string instrument is also fun but you don't always use both bass and treble clef like you do in piano.

Paris non  rifatta, lei stessa ha confessato di avere poco seno e al massimo si limita a mettersi le lenti colorate (gli occhi azzurri sono lenti colorate, non un dono di "madre natura"), ma il suo progetto  ambizioso: vuole diventare attrice e per fare questo si impegna al massimo, anke facendo qualche corso di recitazione.  vero per ke ha  uno stile di vita "festaiolo" ma insomma, a 24 anni cosa volete ke faccia?? la suora??|`|e7b013978a1d9733c2fe9c076a5b38deaa	A parte quello ke ho detto prima... ricca anke x i suoi filmini strambi porno ke girano su Internt cn i virus!!!!!|`|caa040def0a5f1a8bc1005b1316dcbcfaa	e no! ..continuo io!! ..  6 Difetto: a me nn la dar mai! ..ma nn sa cosa si perde.... ^_______^

AA12029969	It's difficult to say, since they are offering "Moby Dick" as the first book at a greatly reduced price.  Since Homer's "Odyssey" and Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress" are two of the books, they are clearly not in chronological (date of publishing) order.  Maybe they are in order of public voting for the 100 greatest books (although I would be hard put to imagine "Moby Dick" as No.1).

AA10541676	Apply unscented hand lotion to the tat.! Since it has already started to lose color you will have to get it touched up after it heals, but most artists will touch it up for free if you go back in a reasonable amount of time.... Never use medicated anything for a tattoo it will suck the color out of it, as well you should do your best not to put it in hot water too long, keep it out of the sun as much as possible for the first year..... Unscented lotion is the best thing to apply though, because it won't draw out the color.

I always use it and my tattoos heal and look as though theyve been there a while usually in about a fortnight. I've never had to get any of mine retouched.

d973c5fb3b1336fe20c725c40e078561aa	inma,    Perdn que no te pude responder ayer, pero se me haban acabado mis respuestas del da.    Mira, desde las primeras tribus nmadas exista la creencia de que quienes embarazaban a las hembras del grupo no eran los hombres, sino las diosas de la fertilidad.  Despus de todo en muchas ocasiones tenan relaciones y no tenan hijos, as es que lo atribuan a los dioses.    Posteriormente las tribus sedentarias se dieron cuenta de que al tener relaciones se engendraban hijos, pero el mito de que los dioses embarazaban a las mujeres sigui existiendo en el folkore religioso de esas tribus.    Se vuelve a ver esta creencia en los faraones egipcios, quienes rean hijos de dioses en la tierra, y s, adivinaste, nacan de supuestas vrgenes.    Lo mismo para todos los semidioses de la mitologa griega.  Prometeo, Hrcules, todos los que menciones, todos eran hijos de mujeres vrgenes.    ?Porque era esto importante?   Pues porque era la nica manera de demostrar que realmente eran hijos de un dios y no de un hombre.    Finalmente llega el ltimo de los semidioses en poblar la mitologa de los humanos.   Jess.  Por supuesto que tena que haber nacido de una virgen.    De hecho la tendencia actual a decir que el llamar a Mara "Virgen" es un error de traduccin tiene la intencin de quitar la connotacin pagana a la leyenda de Jess.    Para que veas que no es puro rollo mo te dejo una cita de Justino Martir, autor cristiano que escriba all por la poca en que se escribieron los evangelios del nuevo testamento:      Cuando decimos que el Verbo, que es el hijo primognito de Dios, fue creado por sin una unin sexual, y que l, Jesucristo, nuestro maestro, fue crucificado y muri, y se levant y ascendi al cielo; no proponemos nada diferente de lo que ustedes creen sobre los hijos de Jpiter.    -- Justino Mrtir, Primera Apologa cap. xxi|`|345b580661a9dd34c29a98d517d8ca72aa	Creo que no "tuvo" que ser... decidi ser.

El concepto al que se refiere la virginidad es la pureza, ese elemento relacionado con la luz, en el caso de la Virgen de Guadalupe fue el sumar un icono indgena a la cosmogona catlica, para representar la adhesin de estos cultos paganos a la religin catlica, al igual que otros ejemplos en la misma Europa con dioses paganos.    Incluso el termino guadalupano hace referencia a alguien que adora a la Virgen de Guadalupe ms que al mismo Dios (no en todos los casos), Difcil meterse con estos temas y querer encontrar una respuesta correcta, porque debido a las interpretaciones varas respuestas incluso contradictorias puedes ser correctas.

In this state there are no contradictions and no relativity. Everything is constant, absolute.    God knows what God is, but the knowing of a thing and the experiencing of it are two entirely different things. For example you know what ice cream is, but experiencing the taste of it is different (and SO much better) than just intellectually knowing that it is frozen cream and sugar.    God created life as we know it so that God could experience God's self in the world of relativity through us, who are each an individuation of the whole.    God does not judge us for our actions...after this physical incarnation ends we will return to the spiritual dimension and decide if we want to stay or experience another physical incarnation. This is how we serve God.|`|AA11111550	so miraculously delicious..?|`|3e1094b7e39b6633bd2b5f43e91c5011aa	So you could ask that question.|`|2641abf51d374e61d81e9b2e95cc3411aa	because without it there would be no questions, therefore it is.]    edit - circled cross put it much better than i did :)|`|0db3bd614dce87d312d605f4047ce997aa	well it is b'cuz people of earth cud see the beauty,the creations,the wonderful things created by god|`|AA12008460	The corollary is: "What is the difference between a duck?"

Luego tambin comprend que si no tienes una vocacin muy fuerte es muy difcil lograr algo, tiene que ser muy difcil subir todos los das a un escenario y interpretar una y otra vez un personaje durante temporadas largas siempre lo mismo. Un da te duele la cabeza o una muela y tu tienes que rer ,por ejemplo, otro da te peleas con tu mujer, y en tu papel tienes que volver a repetir  como en casa  SI SI Si .

I love the way my mans hand feels spanking my naked asss.

It turns me on so much, it a pleasurable pain that drives me wild and gets me so wet.The harder my man spanks the more I get turned on!!!!I can't explain it buts its a must on my foreplay list!

You have a large part of the history of the human race as witnessed by the beauties of cities like Florence, Rome, Venice, Genoa, Turin, Bologna....   You can experience the delights of the best food in the world and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere almost anywhere.    Italians can be funny and welcoming with strangers but they change from town to town and attitudes differ from the North to the South.    I firmly believe that there are no other countries in the world able to offer such an excellence in diversity. It is a fantastic place to discover and visit;  to live in Italy is less exciting unfortunately... but that is another story!    ciao!|`|b6c436e0c74b0589c146051f62e1db55aa	Italian people is nice, very kind and full of life!

Within a decade of his death    the Muslims had conquered all of the Arabian peninsula. Within a century, Islam had spread from Al-Andalus in Spain to the borders of China. Islam unified science, theology, and philosophy. Muslims were commanded to study, seek knowledge, and learn and benefit from others' experiences by Allah (SWT) in the holy Quran and by the prophet Muhammad (SAW) in the Sunnah. It was this that inspired the Muslims to great heights in sciences, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, philosophy, art and architecture.      Muslim scholars began obtaining Greek treatises and started    their study and translation into Arabic a few centuries after    the Hijrah (622 A.D.) They critically analyzed, collated , corrected and supplemented substantially the Greek science and philosophy. After this period began what is known as the Golden Age of Islam, which lasted for over two centuries. It is here we find many of the great scientists of Islam who literally left behind hundreds and thousands of books on the various branches of science.

0e3fc5be5d3c0d40f8667b63fe95585caa	that would be true if everything was in truth finite - then humans would be finite ie infinitely little in the infinite scheme     but finity is only apparent, not real    infinity is real    eg, electrons can orbit at great speed for infinite time - ie they have infinite energy    in fact everything is infinite - the actual [visible, physical] is not all the real - there is potential also, ie energy - human potential is infinite - out of nowhere comes the idea of the combustion engine, and out of the idea comes billions of cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc - this is new creation, creation from nothing    clearly there is something that is so powerful that it can make zillions of living things, can make nebulae and billions of stars and make empty space to put them in - and this is fully present in every point of space, in every thing, in every atom, in every body, in every human    the purpose of life is finding the infinite in the apparently finite world - what exists is just what we have made so far - there is an infinity of creation ahead of us - like an artist who has future artworks inside her/him    no book 'war and peace' - then, poof! - by magic, 'war and peace' starts to exist    infinite potential [energy] is continuously putting forward actuals [matter, things, bodies, finities, creations] - the finities can only last a finite time - but creation of finities goes on forever - like a fountain, the drops fall into the water and are lost, but the fountain of drops goes on forever    nonexistence cannot exist - by definition - it is all existence - forever - infinite potential pouring out an infinite number of finite creations - joy, energy, life, creativity    and each of us actually inhabits all bodies - we are all of us, each of us, existence itself, which is everything - potential and actual, infinite and finite, creativity and creations    we appear to be 'but one species' - we appear to be specific, limited in time [as individuals and as a species] - but we are not merely what we seem to be from looking outside, from seeing with the senses and the mind, which see only finite bodies -     'there are universes inside every atom'    potential or infinity does not obey any of the rules of bodies or finities - it doesnt have to obey the rule that it can only be in one place per time - it can be wholely present in multiple places, and yet be only one, not many    like an idea - whole in you and whole in me, and yet one idea, not two specimens of one idea    since all of our experience is of finity, it is hard for us [and our ideas] to have correct ideas about infinity - we keep putting finity concepts into infinity science - like thinking infinity is superlarge - whereas infinity is sizeless    i dont know if i can put this into words, but the idea you present is actually selfcontradictory - it involves imagining oneself outside humanity, thinking about humanity as an object, and therefore able to think of humanity as finite and therefore as posssibly nonexistent - the finity of humans [the present form of humanity] is limited, and you can get outside it, and that form can disappear forever - and it will, it must, for it is finite - but humanity and the present human body [and mind] are two different things    we have the infinite potential to pull out of nowhere not only [an infinite number of] new [finite] ideas but an infinite number of new minds, new awarenesses  - there is nothing but existence, and we are it, and existence clearly is able to make universes, consciousnesses, life    the instant we decide that war is not good [exciting, dramatic, gripping], war will stop existing - the instant we prefer order and peace to insanity and mess, order and peace will exist    we think we think that war is terrible, and death is bad, but our cavilier attitude to bullets and bombs, our great love affair with weapons and explosions and guns and danger and horror and action and fear and grim things and so on, shows that we more than half know we are infinite, perfectly safe - the other animals, conscious only of their finity, hold on to life and happiness with every effort - but humans are different, gay destroyers because they are more than half conscious of being infinite creators - humans are insincere when it comes to pursuit of happiness and survival, goodness and peace - our souls thrive on explosions and bullets and danger and death -     humans live between infinity and finity, immortality and mortality, reality and illusion, power and powerlessness, deliberately deceiving ourselves that finity exists in order to enjoy the show    the fact we can enter a movie theatre and get 'caught up in' the story, shows we are able to decieve ourselves of the reality of unreality    there is just no other way to explain our perfect equanimity in the face of war growing for millenia and the coming destruction of all earth life by nuclear winter - to explain why we race to see films of war and death and danger - animals hightail it out of there as soon as they get the idea there is danger, birds fly off as soon as they hear a gunshot, but humans will stress themselves to bodily and mental destruction on battlefields for years    your quote is very untrue to the facts, imo|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	When assuming the role of dispassionate observer (or as close as I can get to that) I do agree.

Despus la gente recuerda la pelicula y no el libro, por eso no podra decir que me gustara ver la peli de un libro determinado.

40db37568fbb3e96fac455a31371d471aa	ni satira politica, ni es cierto que el pinto la cruz de caballero, le fue agregado al cuadro a la muerte de velazques, el cuadro es mezcla de filosofia y arte, la razon y el sentimiento hechos arte, se ha descubierto que los cuadros al fondo de la habitacion son de rubens, quien fue admirado por velazques, las meninas de la corte , jovenes mozas que cuidan de la infanta margarita que acompa?a a velasquez en la ejecucion del retrato de los reyes de espa?a quienes estan situados donde el espectador ve el cuadro, a lado de las meninas estan los enanos de la corte y hasta el perro, al fondo se ve la figura de un hombre que se detiene a ver todo esto , antes de subir al siguiente piso, asi que velazques solo detiene el tiempo y de paso se autoretrata inmortalmente.    pd, claro que todo lo anterior es solo una representacion teatral no un acto que sucedio en verdad, pues el cuadro pintado no es de los reyes sino el de todos siendo retratados en un espejo mientras velazques los pinta.|`|c40f0f83394972d1728fe4eb26d94092aa	Una pintura puede hacer realidad un sentimiento, pensamiento o incluso una idea, la pintura figurativa solo trata de representar fotograficamente la realidad. y es un reflejo de ella tal como una fotografia puede serlo.

De ah en ms que es lo que Velazquez quiso decir con su pintura solo l lo sabe. Lo que la gente dice no pasa de ser interpretaciones personales. Pero que podemos decir a ciencia cierta es que en esa poca la pintura se utilizaba para retratar la realidad, ya que no exista la fotografa, y para eso Velazquez era un genio.|`|ff0bc55c399acf7953fdf6d63aec0179aa	La realida se construye, no est dada preexistentemente. El caudro de Velzquez ("Las meninas") ha sido largamente analizado por diversos autores perdn pero en este momento no tengo presente a ninguno, prometo que te lo averiguo)es una tpica obra barroca, es decir, se vale de los recursos como el trampantojo (tambin conocido como trompe l'oeil) y el juego de las miradas especulares para atrapar al espectador. Hay quienes afirman que la imagen levemente desvanecida del espejo a la izquierda podra pertenecer al reflejo de los reyes que estn de ste lado, el del pintor, que est autorretratndose y a su mismo acto de pintar. Por ello es tan enigmtica como atrayente. El recorrido visual elptico es otro rasgo barroco.  Aunque reducido espero, este anlisis te sea de utilidad.|`|c17d40640fb8dbfc9dcfc8f66e5acacaaa	La pintura es una obra clsica del barroco espa?ol, Velzquez fue sin duda el pintor de cmara y como tal trataba de asegurar su trabajo.    Lo que es importante destacar es que maneja el claroscuro de una manera muy particular, ya que adiferencia de otros genios del barroco como Caravaggio o Vermer Van delft, pues en esta pintura si la analizas bien, ms que una stira a las enanas meninas es un estudio de la luz, por que en primer plano (donde se supone que estan los reyes) se encuentra iluminado, hay despues un segundo plano donde la habitacin parece estar oscura y remata en el fondo de la habitacin con una puerta abierta que genera luz.    De esta manera Diego rompe con el esquema de una fuenta de luz que se vena manejando comunmente en esa poca.    Otro detalle lo encontrars en la vestimenta de Velazquez, ya que porta el escudo de caballero, elemento que lo coloc despus de haber terminado el trabajo.|`|a3567b7635f88c3ef8e9bf24e0cd881faa	Una pintura atrapa la realidad, un reflejo de la realidad, la fantasa y todo lo que la mente y el corazn quieran.|`|61d89322bba6a4dfc96d707fc292f7e3aa	supongo  que queria atrapar la realidad, en esa epoca no existia la fotografia y plasmaban su obra como una realidad, los claro oscuros son maravillosos y tambin creo que no eran muy agraciados los de la familia real no les parece?

A home is like coming back to your own galaxy after an intergalactic trip.   Or like a bed when your tired.  Like food when you are hungry.  Like water when you are thirsty.

Like a deep breath in the summer.|`|f4cc06720ee5147ef58788be047bdf95aa	Imagery is the use of descriptive words to create a visual image in the poem. Examples of imagery are...    "A bed, unmade and messy, but covered in sunlight from the open window."  "A steaming plate of food, freshly prepared and smelling great."  "A tired dog, its tongue lolling, its eyes beginning to close."    Think about your home. What do you see when you walk in the door? When you enter the kitchen? When you go to sleep? Walk from room to room and try to describe what you see in detail.     Instead of "I see a chair" say something more descriptive and poetic, like "A chair, old and worn, the color of Christmastime cinnamon."    Get it? Basically you need to describe your home. Think of the five senses. What do you smell, hear, taste, see and feel? Also, what emotions do you feel about your home? Does it make you feel proud, safe, happy or lonely?    Keep in mind that a poem calls for good ryhtym and flow, and I'm sure you'll do well!

I'd like to hang out in Penetanguishene Ontario around this time, mingle, hang out, learn some obscure backwoods patois of french...|`|12d99e1ff8a38fe71cc5bdd41198fd16aa	Turtle Island before the European " invasion " PLEASE|`|AA11024478	North America in the 1700's. Any time "civilization" started to get in your way you could just pick up and move. if you were a French voyageur you would be able to get along with the Natives as well as the whites.|`|9f5ce091b058bf3c19272b661196de03aa	this one's just fine with me, medicine, cars, computers, public services.|`|23ed6ed331b288040ea6e09da46e0ba1aa	THE 30'S AND 40'S AND ILOVE THE FIFTIES.|`|3f970b1b4f80c658a9689ea92866e474aa	The future. I think in the past that in most eras they had poor hygene, bad hair, sloopy bodies. I look how woman are built these days compared to 20's to 80's and it wasn't pretty. Every decade got alittle better. These day even white woman have a butt and 10 -20 years ago most were flat. I assume it will get better as time goes on. I think that morals are bad these days but being black there was slavery and real bad racism during those assumed times of  better moral.
AA12238219	Power is a survival skill too|`|7be4d4699be00352119f0061264512c3aa	The fact is, there are no shoulds or shouldn'ts.  These are created by the individual.       When individual s  focus on what other s should do or not, Then they are trying to controll the other.  This is an interest of Power as well.      Remember, that there are many forms of interests in power, and no matter the intention, One must not stray from there own path, if they wish to contribute peace into the world.      If everyone , focused on there own path, and decided to walk there own path,( instead of looking at other people and telling them to "follow me"), then the world would change to peace over night.       For example, if a person wants to lead others the way Home.  Then one should point their torch of light in front of themself, and look to where they step ahead.           Yet if that person, is Always looking behind himself to see if anyone is following, then he is NOT looking at where he walks,  (which is just like walking blindly, for you do not see where you go)    And he is also leading Whom ever is following him, Into darkness.|`|05a2de2fad25308c9051fbf79fe6d06caa	If the power is going to be used to better human life, then I think they can work hand in hand.  I think power preceeds human betterment.  It enables those who are working toward humanitarian ends.|`|1475db461f5084db47703d9c9a05fa5baa	Vested interests like power (are) for the betterment of human life.|`|AA11024478	Certainly! but that would require the majority of people to reject the belief that possessions and power will provide them security.    This belief structure is obviously false. All people will grow old, will suffer, will die, and can't take any of their possessions with them.    Acceptance of these inevitable facts will lead people to practice mutual compassion.

Es increible como la gente puede elogiar a alguien con la calidad humana de este hombre. Sinceramente es cuando uno se da cuenta de que el hecho que que gente como Michael mueva multitudes, hace parecer que las personas no son pensantes. Puedo entender que Michael tuvo una vida dificil y por eso tiene los problemas que tiene, pero lo inconprensible es como la gente lo convirti en cono. Humilde opinin, no le deseo mal, slo quisiera que no afectara ms a la humanidad.
