jxYGEGcCaa	I'll be honest. <br>  1) warn him - tell him "look,.... i dont know what your problem is but you better stop. why are you so obssesd with me. Your things are NOT mean and hurtful they are creepy and annoying. Dont make me pull a restraint warrant on you freak"<br>  <br>  2) Punch him- If he doesn't stop, let loose. thats what i would do. well, its not the adult thing to do right here so i guess you can tell a  teacher, but you and me both know how that works out<br>  - you tell teacher<br>  -Teacher tells student<br>  -Student picks on you worse now for crying to a teacher|`|qUiuRDs6aa	i agree with a witty comment back to him but you have got to be careful because peeps like him usually have a comment for everything and that will make you look worse. tell the teacher because making fun of you is a form of bullying and it will get worse. also, have you ever thought this lad might fancy you, they always say the one's who play dirty towards a girl is just doing so as a form of flirtation ' yeah its a mans world lol' good luck and dont let him keep getting you (no violence you'll get kicked out of school)|`|d1P05XfPaa	I'll do it for you!|`|fmC4Bbalaa	Well, your leaving out a lot of information. You say everyone laughs, does that mean this guys well liked or popular, because you want to make sure you don't mess with the wrong person.<br>  If your witty or good at come backs try to come up with something that others would find funny, but that would make the guy realise your not one to mess with.
2GhwuXksaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I have used these and although they are sensitive, I was still advised by my doctor to use the first urine of the day. (I took 6 tests when I was pregnant but only the last one gave me a positive result)|`|v6JENiapaa	The tests available now are much more sensitive than they used to be and can pick up really very early pregnancies.  However, I still think it is better to use the early morning specimen, i.e. the first one of they day as that is when there is the greatest concentration of the hormone tested for (hcg).  It also depends on how late your period is.  If the pregnancy could be a couple of months then it shouldn't matter what time of day you test.  As these tests can be quite expensive, you don't really want to be doing them at the wrong times.  Try it again in a week if you can bear to wait that long.|`|O7QyQl15aa	You are best off trying the first pee of the day as this is when your levels of HCG are at their highest.  At the early stages of pregnancy they are at low levels so need to test when urine most concentrated to pick up.  Alternatively wait a week and try again.  The level should show at '3rd pee' level rather than the concentrated 'first pee'!, alternatively you may just not be pregnant?|`|BWUlksmmaa	I took a non-early test (sainsburys cheapie one) at 10-11dpo and got a faint line.  It depends whether you are prepared to waste your money on the chance your body hasn't produced enough hcg yet.  I was personally too impatient to wait!|`|1CryEnb3aa	Yes, the first morning is more concentrate.  But, if you have at least 3 hrs in between pees, it has had a chance to gt more concentrate again.  I would say if no AF on the day it is due, take another one.  The earlier you test prior to your periods actual due date the less accurate it is.  It the day of AF, like 99.0%  Good luck and baby dust|`|OJFz0LBZaa	a lot of test say you can test any time of day but i have always done mine with 1st morning urine as its more concentrated and contains the highest amount of hcg levels  to detect pregnancy, if you have small amounts of hcg it would have been watered down by you drinking and will come out negative, when in fact you could be  pregnant, test again 1st thing in the morning in a few days time
46HhlH2Kaa	Look, I totally disagree with the first response of you getting knocked up and looking for a job.  That was just rude. Rather you have a job or not,  your baby needs it's milk.  You would need to go to your local Health Department and tell them you want to sign up for wick for your baby.  And go to the food stamp office and sign up for food stamps.  Get everthing you can from the government because you deserve it.  I am sure either you, you mom or dad or other family members have worked  and have paid taxes for years so you should get help with your baby.  Yes, perhaps you need to get a job to help support your baby but in the same sense what the hell does it matter if the government has to take care of one more child.  Hell, the goverment sends our money to other countries when the people in the USA need help.  We have a really f***ed up system.  to take care of other f****g countries and there are people starving right here in the USA.  So dont let these responses get to you. Perhaps you could go to college.  I was 16 when I had my son and I never got Welfare, but is was hard but when my son when to kindergarden I went back to college and got a business degree. I dont know your age, but whatever you do, dont give up on your dreams.  Best wishes.....|`|qUr5P7hgaa	you shouldn't be having a baby if you can not afford to feed the baby on your own.

eytlIKITaa	It does sound like you ovulated on the 20th, give or take a day.  Did you check your cervix too?  Was it high, soft, open?  You wouldn't be having any symptoms yet, implantation doesn't happen until about 10 days after fertilization.  I would wait 2 weeks from the 20th to test (March 6th)- It would also be right after you missed your period too, which is always a good sign!  Good luck Dear!  <br>  <br>  Baby dust to us!!!|`|xwOwsZvEaa	yes that sounds like ur ovulating, but you should wait till you miss ur period if you take it to early u will only b deflated and upset.<br>  good luck xx

If you are in early labor and wish to speed things up you could try tinctures of black and/or blue cohosh. 15 drops an hour should help soften your cervix and open you up. Nipple stimulation, tell you partner to start sucking, could help. Massage of the perineum may also be encouraging and it could also help you not to tear. <br>  Take herbs at own risk I suggest looking it up further on the internet for your own peace of mind.|`|C7DOTjhqaa	I know you're uncomfortable, but trust me, once that baby comes you'll long for the days when you could have a few minutes free time to shower, and could sleep more than a couple of hours!<br>  <br>  Just take it easy and wait for nature's time.

145RUNQHaa	Is she toddler age?if so just put things she wants back on the shelves when she's not looking and distract her attention to something else to take her mind off a tantrum.get her to help you put things you do want in the trolley and get her involved in the shopping trip.praise her when she's being helpful and don't make a big deal out of a tantrum or it makes it worse.x|`|MlCWsBcwaa	How old is your daughter?  A quick smack (that is more loud than painful) might be very humiliating and shock her that you would actually do that at the shops.  If she is too young, I would avoid these situations as much as possible for a while.  If she is old enough and resorts to this destructive behaviour again, I would calmly take her home and go to her toys and take a good one and go back to the shops and give it to the staff there - tell her that you are going back to the shops to do this because she broke things at the shops that were not hers and this toy is going to help pay for the things she broke.  Tantrums are part of this, but so is respect for things that aren't ours. Maybe you could also use a star chart - one pink star for each time she behaves at the shops and one black star for each time she is naughty.  Five pink stars in a row mean she earns a treat and three black stars means no dessert, or no tv, or no bedtime story or confiscated toy etc.   If she is on a good run or on thin ice, remind her before going to the shops. Good luck.|`|J5TbYvVZaa	I've been here! It's no fun. What I've started doing is letting my son (2.5) pick out a toy or two when we get to the store. He get's to carry it around while we're in the store. But when we check out, I tell him we have to give it back to the lady so that the other kids who come to the store have something to carry around too. He's never fussed about that! Works like a charm!|`|FsXTyGH9aa	she has to learn that tantrums will get her nowhere. when she does this completly ignore her and make sure she does not get her way. make sure you do not shout or get mad yourself as she will only copy you.. get down to look her in the eyes and tell her not to behave like that. make sure she is rewarded for good behaviour too!|`|UnK7MqMgaa	More discipline, you are obviously too leniant with her.|`|zqfs7A6Caa	Somebody mentioned letting her carry a toy around the store. We do this with our son, but there have been a couple public tantrums anyway. Nothing has ever gotten broke, but that is probably because we left right away. Since about age 3, a meltdown in public has meant a pantsdown in private when we got home. Basically, a discussion in the car about what was going to happen, followed by a very sound spanking when we got home.<br>  <br>  I have seen other children throw tantrums until they were 8-9 years old. I believe that with proper discipline, by the age of 3 any child can be taught to "calm down" when told. It is just a matter of consistency; the child must know what to expect if she throws a tantrum. If the consequence is unpleasant enough for her to not want to throw a fit, she will quickly learn to stop herself as soon as you tell her to.<br>  <br>  Adults have to control their anger too, regardless of how tired/hungry they are or how bad they want something they can't have. Tantrums are something that too many children are allowed to have. Ignoring the problem will not make it go away.
fBhXFLSUaa	it dosn matter how light the second line is once its there at all your pregnant, congratulations, and yes first thing in morning is the best time to do one but you are defo pregnant if a second showed up. ring your nurse or doctors they'll tell ya the same|`|LJ3zUgrIaa	You are pregnant.  Honestly, I hated those pregnancy tests that had one and two lines.  They are so subjective and hard to interpret!!  When I finally has a test that I thought possibly looked positive, i went out and spent a little more $$ on a digital pregnancy test, one that says "not pregnant" or "pregnant" and it was positive.  I think I used "Clear Blue."  They run about $3-$4 more per test, but they tell it like it is :)  Also, your first morning urine is the most dense in HcG, the hormone that the pregnancy tests are measuring- so test first thing in the morning for most accuracy! Congrats!|`|k939aYhAaa	yeah do it right when you get up in the morning and yes i had that happen to me too about how the line was faded so i wasnt sure if i was or not but i went to planned parenthood and i definetly was. but again you might not be. if your freaking out about not having your period on time dont stress out about it bc stress can effect your period. hope i helpedd|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	your right 2 lines is defo positive and 99% of the time its will be so much fainter than the control line<br>  so congratulations you gonna have a baby  x x x|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like you are pregnant!!

k939aYhAaa	you can try saltine crackers and water. every woman is different so you gotta try to figure out what you can eat and keep down. personally when i was prego i ate alottt of cereal and ice cream but anything else would make me sick. but basically anything thats kinda bland with not alot of flavor or aroma should work. try drinking ginger tea supposedly that helps too but i never liked it|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Papaya enzyme pills- they are chewable- they help better than anything I have ever tried, even on morning sickness. You can get them at a health food or drug store. If you can't do that, try a non-acidic fruit. Crackers or dry toast might work too. Good luck. That is the worst feeling. I hate having an upset stomach.<br>  <br>  PS I know- not morning sickness, but it does work on morning sickness too. I saw the four month old twins thing. Congrats by the way.|`|Ny4lALx8aa	okay the reason you cant keep anything down is because your body wants to fast, to help your toxins clear out. My suggestion is to make vegetable soup (no meat, nothing heavy). Let the veggies simmer for like an hour or less. When its ready, drink the broth. Throw in some rye crackers because they are easy to digest. If you can get this down, try to eat the veggies along with tons of water a bit later. Keep hydrated to curve the feelings of hunger until then. good luck|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I have the cure for morning sickness<br>  raw ginger root<br>  peel slice off a piece the size of a nickle<br>  eat it<br>  no more morning sickness|`|uj1A73ZGaa	You can try some dry toast that's what I try when I get the flu. Also, try sipping some ginger ale. Say you take two sips if it stays down for 15mins than you can have more in 15mins. That should help settle your stomach.<br>  <br>  good luck hope you feel better soon
Cx5Zo7IIaa	I've used them dozens of times, I always keep a few around cause you never know. I buy them in bulk half a dozen or a dozen at a time, they're only a dollar. I've only had two fail me (not as a false positive or anything) no lines showed up. But that's why they have a line as a control so you know when it's bunk.<br>  <a href="http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.htm...</a><br>  This lists almost every pregnancy test known to woman, it'll help you understand.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Yes.  The hcg is what all urine test look for.  Good luck.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	YES, they do work.  As long as you HGC level is where it needs to be...which is the same for almost all of the pregnancy test, it does work.  I can say from asking dr.s, to studying up, to actually using them myself, THEY DO WORK!  <br>  <br>  If you are wanting an answer alittle before you think a test will detect it...like before the missed period...then no, they will not detect it like those test out there that say they will 5 days before your missed period.  The reason those expensive ones are able to detect it 5 days before your missed period is because they look for a lower hgc level.  But the regular ones you buy in walmart that are more expensive and the dollar ones you buy in dollar general are usually just as accurate.  <br>  <br>  Atleast dr.'s say, research says, and I do...cuz I've tried them.  lol<br>  <br>  Good luck on whichever way you are hoping to go, prego or not!!!  :o)|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	I didn't know there was Dollar Store Pregnancy Tests out there.

433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Perfectly normal very good weight. Estimations are never easy or spot on, but by the current weight of 4lbs 2 ounces, i'd imagine he/she would weigh between 7-9lbs when born. Baby could gain as much as a pound per week from around 36 weeks, so bear that in mind also.. The head usually goes down into the pelvis somewhere around 30-35 weeks, or in many cases later. As you get further on, it'll usually stay there, although it is possible for bubba to bob a few more times in uncertainty..|`|OJFz0LBZaa	at my 32 week scan my little one was estimated to weigh 4lb something and doctor said that was fine, also she has been head down from week 30 and now 3/5 engaged which means nothing really as i could still go over my due date, and even though yours is head down they can still turn and go head down again a number of times before labour|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Sounds good...Nope some babys are head down at 20 week shaha...they flip flop but at 33 baby will probably stay there:) They say at 34 weeks I think that the baby gains 1/2 lb per week so you're looking at an average sized child probably 7 lbs some odd ounces :)|`|Bg6txvxqaa	I was a week overdue and still only weighed 6lb's 6 oz so you can never tell!<br>  <br>  I was fine, just had some normal baby jaundice and that was it! Couple of mins under the lamp and I was right as rain!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Yeah that's really good! No it's not too early to be head down, my daughter went head down at 30 weeks and stayed there :)|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds about right.  As far as being head down, your baby could still turn again.  And as far as telling how much (s)he will way, no idea.  Depends on your weight gain and how much the baby gains between now and then.  the baby puts on something around a pound a week at the end.  So you could possibly have a big baby.  I went a week over due with my last and she weighed 9 pbs 3 oz.  She was huge!  Good luck and best wishes!!
aKkDWz5Waa	i think ur mildly experiencing a form of depression during pregancy. thats not a crime. its normal, and i believe u want the baby, but we all know a baby comes with consequences, like ur gonna have to start putting it in front of urself nd no longer have as much life of ur own so this might be ur subconscious acting out. its not a horrible thing, it happens to the best of mothers, after all, we're still human, nd like i said, i believe ur happy about the baby, but this is natural. however, u would need to work at making sure u dnt let any of this affect ur baby.<br>  <br>  many mothers develop a serious depression after having given birth, so there is the possibility that ur lack of enthusiasm now is forshadowing this (i hope not). u havent mentioned any desire to kill ur baby/havent been seeing any horrible images of u doing things to it. but if u begin to this is post parnum depression (i think its how u spell it) nd its extremely serious. its dangerous for the child nd exhausting for u cuz u would spend ur nursing days contsantly battling the urge to hurt ur child. getting this DOES NOT mean ur a bad mother nd if u develop it the best thing u can do is talk about it to those u know will understand and start seeing a good psychologist so u can be helped.<br>  <br>  maybe the best way to relieve u from ur current state is to go out with ur husband more often nd have him treat u to things so that u have fun recognize ur life isnt over. also make achievable life goals for urself to make sure u still feel ur living ur life nd have sth to look forward to nd work at thats just for u. i know depression makes people lazy, but make a huge effort and DECIDE THESE GOALS TONIGHT. <br>  <br>  throughout ur marriage u have to keep finding time to do things for urself from time to time, or ur going to start hating life nd u will take it out on ur child (not necessarily physically hurting them, ppd is usually only a problem while ur child is a baby) but u will keep lashing out at him/her about every little thing nd ur life will be miserable. So really, dedicating urself entirely to becoming a mom doesnt make u a better one- in fact it is healthier for everyone if u stayed happy too, so just make sure u keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|ChpS0laRaa	you are right, it probably is hormones, you will be constantly tired until you are at least 3 months, i know i was. You have to really think about what you want to do though, I left my job when i found out i was pregnant and spent 9 months bored senseless, You need something to make you feel like you and what better than your job?<br>  <br>  mention it to your doctor and see what they suggest, or if you are looking to kill some time try looking at www.bounty.co.uk its a great site for pregnant women and you get lots of freebies<br>  <br>  Feel better soon and take care|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Im lethargic too. From 6 weeks right up to today Im knackered. Last week was the first time in 3 weeks that I went out every day but I am paying for it now. I was sleeping up to 15 hours a day and then when I got up sitting around not interested in anything. Luckily I don't work other wise I wouldn't have my job. It is your hormones. Mine to was a planned pregnancy.|`|3xMQW0A6aa	i can relate. i am 10wks.. and since i found out i have been sleeping tons, and am so lazy. sometimes i dont even want to get off the couch to take a shower. my life consists of home and work, and home again.  <br>  im sure (as i've heard from everyone) that this is normal during the first trimester.  and actually within the last week its lightened a little. so there is hope! you will get through it!! your body is using all your energy to grow a baby!|`|OhMdbiNmaa	I have broken my arm snowboarding i am also bored i have a week off school and this is only Monday! I am downloading games but can't play all because of bad arm this won't be a problem for you, though. Also go to blockbusters and get lot's of movies, or series i can't really suggest any because i don't know your taste. I hope i helped, this is also an idea of not being bored just answer peoples questions! lol. Good luck|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	Your hormones are wacked out at this time but should get better soon.  Your feeling tired because of all the hormones being out of wack and the baby beginning to grow and your belly changing.  Prenatal vitamin's will also help a lot.|`|kGdiGxJqaa	<a href="http://getinfo.knows.it" rel="nofollow">http://getinfo.knows.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|1CryEnb3aa	I remember with my second one, I couldn't wait to get off work and go to bed.  It was the first thing I thought of when I woke up in the morning.  My husband was working out of town a lot and l had pretty much all the responsibility of our 5 yr old.  I would take her to school and then go to work, pick her up, help with home work, fis dinner, get her bath.  I would have us in bed by 7-7:30 at night.  It was crazy.  Although, we did have to get up at 5 AM.  She had to be at school at 7:10.  But, yeah, I couldn't wait to get to bed and just sleep.  Some pregnancies are like that.  Some, don't react like this.  It should get better for you once you get into your 2nd trimester.  Good luck and congrats.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	It is normal to be completely tired and lethargic in the first trimester.  They say that it gets better after that.  I am 12 weeks pregnant with my first baby and I had been at a point where I couldn't get out of bed even after 13 hours' sleep - I was going to bed at 8:00pm most nights, and there was no way that I could bring myself to do any household chores or anything.  However, this seems to have changed just over this past weekend as I got out of bed on Saturday morning literally bouncing around ... so that would be about right!  So hang in there!<br>  <br>  Going to work is a struggle ... I know what makes it worse for me is the thought of a commute standing up on an extremely crowded tube when I feel sick already, never mind the thought of sitting in an office all day.  However, I know for me personally, I'm motivated to go by the fact that I can't afford not to work and I can't afford to not be paid for my maternity leave, so that in itself is enough motivation to actually make me go.  I only started my job three months ago and my employer has six months probation periods, so I'm still on my probation period and therefore attendance and timekeeping are important.<br>  <br>  However, it sounds to me like your problem is more to do with life in general rather than just tiredness from pregnancy.  I don't really know what to suggest, except that when you see your doctor you should ask if counselling is a possibility.  Everyone knows about post-natal depression, but ante-natal depression also occurs but just isn't so publicised.  I have read that if you are prescribed antidepressants, some people think that they don't want to take them in case they harm the baby, but this is wrong and you should take them because the drugs don't have that much effect on the baby ... what's worse is when a baby is born to a depressed mother.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck, I'm sure you'll feel better about everything when the initial period of sickness and tiredness wears off.
pzLDXL6gaa	AFAIK no you don't. I think the only Australian state where you do is WA. I just checked online and that's what the info seems to support though there isn't much info available. I suggest you call a clinic and ask them.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Sounds like someone wasn't quite old enough for sex...it depends on where you live... google abortion laws in your state...but please think about adoption instead.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	yup, I believe you do.|`|k939aYhAaa	yeah it does depend on where you live and usually yes you do need permission but most states wont let you get an abortion once your 3 months along. personally i'm against abortion and so if you dont want to keep the baby at least thing about giving it up for adoption.|`|mgLNIfiIaa	It depends on where you live.<br>  <br>  But just because you have your parents permission and the states permission it doesn't make it okay to take the life of your own child. Think carefully, because once your baby is gone it isn't coming back.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Where do you live honey? That would help us answer your question.<br>  This should help if you have any other question call the clinic closest to you. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/issues-action/abortion/state-abortion-restrictions-19943.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/issues-...</a>|`|LJ3zUgrIaa	You are considered an emancipated adult if you are pregnant.
9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	It TOTALLY depends on the person. I know many 40 year olds who I don't feel would make suitable parents! For the most part though being an adult is a good start lol. If you are done school, have a full time job or are a housewife with someone who has a good job, your own home ( dont have to own but dont live with your parents ) and have decent life experience and in a steady relationship ( usually being married is a good sign ) Honestly most people under 20ish are too immature but it depends on the person. Everyone I know who had kids as a teenager is a mess. None of them can handle it and in fact worse in some cases. I know a girl who is 24 and has a son and just doesn't want to take responsibility and would rather go out with her friends and do makeup etc..>There isn't time to take a piss when you have a baby especially when they start crawling haha|`|kprKXEOSaa	Ha! Ha!  The other answerer said "18 - 35."  That's right!  <br>  Of course it depends on the person and their life.  <br>  It's a big mistake to have a child as an end in and of itself.  You have to be at a place in your life where you're ready to be a mom, not just that you want a baby.  You have to be ready to give, it's not about what you want.  It's also very helpful to be in a stable marriage, having a baby won't fix marital problems, and often amplifies them.  Having a baby is very stressful!  And if your husband felt a little neglected before the baby was born, he's going to feel completely left out in the cold after!  The state of the relationship is very very important, you have to be at a place where you're very secure and trust each other.  Finances are also important.<br>  <br>  However, all that being said, there is no way you can ever be 100% ready to have a child.  That just isn't possible.  No one is perfect, and no one is a perfect parent, and life isn't perfect.  When you get to the point that you're starting to feel ready, but you're not sure and still have some trepidation--well, if the basic good foundation is in place for the formation of a family, you just have to jump in with both feet.  You never would feel totally ready, it is a leap of faith.  <br>  <br>  There are also obviously many circumstances where pregnancies are not planned, and the parents aren't ready in any way to be parents.  In those cases, adoption is a great option.  It all comes back to what I said originally, you have to be ready to give, it's not just about what you want anymore.|`|1IDSGM71aa	I agree that 18-35 is the safest time to have children, as far as the mother's and baby's health goes. Before and after that there are health risks for both. Otherwise, whenever you feel emotionally ready and as financially comfortable as you think you will be. In my opinion, no one is ever really "ready" to have their first child. Basically, you have to adopt the Nike saying and "Just do it" because very few people are ever truly ready. That's just my opinion from what I've learned from personal experience and talking to other people. It's hard to have kids. It makes life difficult, but even more worth living if you want children.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	25-30 is the perfect age. The human brain isn't fully developed until we are 25, and it really needs to be. This also gives you time to get a college education- You're going to need it when the bills start rolling in, and it's easier to get it before you have kids.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	18-35 is best age to have children in<br>  before and after, your more at risk of child having down syndrome and other problems<br>  Yes it is mainly down to the individual and when you feel ready but in a sense, if everyone waited until they were ready then no one would have kids as its always a scary thing!!|`|XVVkrlnTaa	Yeah, I agree with the first answer. I'm 23 and me and my husband are ttc #1.

There is no way for sure to tell if a girl has had sex or not, only she knows the truth and if she wants to tell you it then that's up to her, if you really want to know just ask her, whatever she says you can chose if you want to believe her or not, but a got marriage depends on trust and if you love her then it shouldn't make a difference if she has had sex or not.|`|hlOawARXaa	Theres no way to tell if she is or is not a virgin.

Try finger foods that are a bit wetter like quartered grapes, pieces of banana, blueberries.  <br>  <br>  Mince is a good food (in gravy or made up into a bolognaise etc) as is mash potato, mashed veggies (mashed with the back of a fork, now pureed) and pasta.|`|Pgolh0L8aa	My son was exactly like that at that age. What I was when it was his feeding time i would have something so when he seen my plate he of coarse wanted mine.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	It's okay, stop freaking. I had the same thing happen to me, you'll make up for it in your last trimester just keep choking down your vitamins.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Many women are sick their whole pregnancy, and their babies are fine.  Just make sure what you do eat is healthy, and you can try a few tricks, like not eating dry foods and drinking liquids at the same time.  Some women also find that including a few minutes of very gentle exercise also helps.  I know you don't feel like it, but even just walking outdoors for 10 minutes.  And of course the old stand by, saltine crackers.  Or dry Cheerios.  It often helps to not let your stomach get empty, basically nibble on something all the time.  Some doctors will also give you B12 vitamin shots for the nausea, ask yours about this.  But even if you are sick the whole time and can't find ways to help it go away, your baby will be fine.  (I know, that's little comfort when you feel so terrible!)<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to not get dehydrated.  Your urine should look light yellow in the toilet.  If it is dark, you may be dehydrated and may need to go in for an IV of fluids.  (And although that wouldn't be fun, it might actually help with the nausea.)  I found that cold water made my nausea worse, so I would let the water come to room temperature before drinking it.  You can also drink other things, like Gatorade or even Pedialyte, which is for kids.  Pedialyte also makes little popsicles you can try, or you can make your own.  You just have to find something that you can keep down, because dehydration is very bad for you and the baby.  Peppermint tea is good, and some women like ginger tea, although that didn't help me.  Experiment and see what works for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  My nausea went away at about 16 weeks, so hopefully you're nearing the end of yours, too.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	by the time i was 12 weeks pregnant I wasn't even being sick really, maybe once a week, and I only managed to gain 3lb's!<br>  <br>  I haven't really gained anything since other than the weight of the babies which, let's face it isn't much. Plus I'm being sick every morning and sometimes during the day and at night.<br>  <br>  Talk to your midwife about any issues you have regarding your weight gain, but some women don't put any weight on, or just a little right up until 30 weeks.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different and people keep tellign me how small I still am considering I'm having twins. It really doesn't matter, just speak to your midwife and they might be able to recommend something, but for now, ginger biscuits, crackers, dry toast and lemonade/ginger beer should be your best friends!<br>  <br>  All the best hun, I hope it gets better for you! And for me, it's starting to get me down a bit now but at least it's not forever and we've got something wonderful to look forward to at the end of it all. x|`|yNoENquTaa	i'm almost 15 weeks and weigh 47 kilos. i've lost about two kilos already. i asked my doctor today and he said that even if you are not gaining weight the baby can still be growing fine and if you are gaining weight your baby might have an actual problem. so basically your weight is not a correct indication to the baby's health.. i understand your worries as this is my first also, but talk to your doctor and have them reassure you. also it's quite common to loose weight at first due to lack of appetite and then what you do get into you the baby takes straight away, leaving you dry. if your morning sickness is bad enough you can get tablets to curb this. just make sure you keep your fluids up. this is rally important. but talk to your doctor. =]<br>  best of luck with your little one. =]<br>  ???<br>  <br>  i'm not sure what that is in pounds... 47 kilos would rougly be 100lbs and 2 kilos is about 5lbs. just an estimate.|`|CPwdVc4caa	I'm also 15 weeks, and at my appointment last week, I weighed in 6 pounds lighter than the previous appointment.  As long as you're taking your vitamins, staying hydrated, and eating as well as you can, the baby will get everything it needs.<br>  <br>  As for the morning sickness, sometimes it just sticks around longer.  I still can't stand the sight of raw meat, and my mom was always nauseous up until 5 months.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I was sick the entire time! And I did not start gaining until 18 weeks and then gained 50 pounds!|`|0SHOXqb4aa	Stop worrying.  I had the same experience twice and all was well.  In fact, both times I was very sick and lost a lot of weight before starting to gain, and I finished pregnancy the same weight as I'd been before getting pregnant.  You may well be at more than 20 weeks before you start to gain weight.   Don't worry about your lack of appetite.  Just eat what appeals to you.  The first time I found that the bad nausea went away at 13 weeks, but I still felt slightly queasy all the way to the birth.  I can tell you, the hospital food tasted wonderful to me because it was the first thing I'd eaten for 9 months without feeling a bit yucky afterwards.  The second time the bad nausea carried on until 24 weeks, but it wasn't quite so severe as it had been the first time.  And again I continued to feel queasy until the end of the pregnancy.   Your body will let you eat more when it needs it.  Just go with how you feel.  I found that I ate more later in pregnancy.  Good luck and congratulations.|`|LJ3zUgrIaa	I dont have a good answer for you because this is my first pregnancy and I dont know, but I am about 10 weeks pg and i have not gained any wt yet either.  I have actually lost about 3lbs since getting pregnant.  I have nausea but no vomiting.  So much stuff gorsses me out, but i think the kicker is that i just cant eat as much in one sitting anymore.  I find that I need to eat more frequent smaller meals.  This week has actually been the best dso far for my nausea, and I'm hoping it stays this way and keeps getting better.  I am really tired all the time, but i dont know when that will ease up.  I've found that eating carbs really help me, and keeping some crakers or dry cereal on my night stand helps.  Also drinking some gatorade right when i wake up helps boost my blood sugar enough to buy me some time till I get ready and make some breakfast.  Hope this helps. :)|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	It's ok just keep taking your vitamins and eat what you can.

Congrats, but i feel your pain!! I had morning, noon and night sickness until i was 4 1/2 months pregnant. This is my first baby too. I lost 1/2 stone when I fell pregnant and didn't start gaining weight until i was 6 months pregnant. im now 36 weeks pregnant and iv only put 2 1/2 stone on, and most of it is my bump. Id have a chat with a midwife just to put your mind at rest. The main concern is having enough fluid intake for your baby and keeping the good nutrients coming in. Ice cold water out the fridge is always refreshing. Keep your chin up, it should wear off soon. Its true what they say, the middle 3 months seem to be the easiest. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|IPALUs7qaa	When I was pregnant I did put on weight (but not much) but then I got sick with the flu or something and lost quite a bit of the weight I'd put on and my doctor said it was fine.

1CryEnb3aa	She is not pregnant.  Or at least that test is invalid.  What you are seeing is an evaporation line.  This shows up after 10 mins or so.  She should have thrown it away after 10 min.

If it was negative then, it's negative now; you need to get a fresh test and try again if you're still worried.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy tests, after being used, will often develop an evaporation line, which can look like a positive result.  It truly means nothing though after the 10 minutes, and should be ignored.|`|dq9uclgpaa	You should go to the doctors to confirm it. That's the only way to actually know.

XnmFz3Pqaa	Wake your husband up...have him drive you back to the ER and see a dr.  A different one if its possible.  <br>  <br>  *I'd also have the hubby call the hospital on the way there and ask for labor and delivery, chances are one of the dr.'s that work at your dr's office will be on call if not at the hospital and they will give you the number or call them personally and let them know what is going on.  If they know about it they will make an effort to get there for you.    <br>  <br>  Then tomorrow when you are feeling better I'd defenatly either call back or if you are still there ask to speak with the big guy at the hospital and let them know your situation having been to the ER already and was sent home.  DO NOT wait on this...GO TO THE HOSPITAL!!!  By sitting there you are putting you and your twins in danger, wake your husband up, Im sure he's not going to matter, sick or not!!!  He loves you...wake him up!<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie.  I'll pray for you!!!  <br>  <br>  And I'd let your dr know after all this the experience you had with the first dr at the er.  I've had a bad experience before in the ER and told the dr about it and she called herself and complained to the guy in charge about how I was sent home and absolutly should not have been.  Im sure that meant alot coming from another dr.<br>  <br>  BUT GO...NOW!  Good luck!!!|`|dq9uclgpaa	you should really go to the ER...this is an emergency!

XnmFz3Pqaa	A big factor would be when your period came last month was that the actual time for it?  If indeed it was time for your period and you started the next day, light or heavy, it doesn't matter, then I'd say you have a greater chance of not being pregnant than of being pregnant.  You have to be ovulating to get pregnant.  If it was actually time for your period to come then that means you would have ovulated about 2 wks BEFORE that day.  Of course it is ALWAYS a chance that its possible but not very possible.<br>  <br>  You can go to these websites, the first one you have to join...its free, and put in your menstraul period date.  It will give you 3 or 4 days that would be your best day to have sex to get pregnant...which are your ovulation days.  This calendar is very accurate as I have used it to get pregnant before!!  If that doesn't work right away or doesn't work for you the second one below you just put in your period date in a drop down and it will give you an estimated ovulation date(s).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/p/163/index22.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/p/163/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calc...</a><br>  <br>  If its not around these dates that you had sex and this happened then you are probably not pregnant...and all these symptoms are probably, as harsh or weird as it sounds, made up...out of your worry.  This happens to many women, more in women who want to get pregnant, their mind fools their body into thinking they are pregnant.  <br>  <br>  It's really too early to have too many signs of pregnancy.  Your hpt test showed negative because it was way to early for any test to show a positive-pregnant or not.  If you have less than 5 days before your period to come you could go buy one of the 5 days before your missed period tests.  They work for a lot of people because they are set to recognize a lower hgc level then the regular ones.   <br>  <br>  I would say all of your signs, head aches, nausea, diarrhea and fatigue....those things can also be symptoms of worry and stress.  I know you say you aren't but obviously you are alittle worried about something or you wouldn't be on here asking about it.  And please dont read that the wrong way!  I think you are just worried and making yourself sick about it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
Bg6txvxqaa	I've been using cocoa butter lotion on my bump which is supposed to be really good for stretch marks.<br>  <br>  I haven't had a single one appear yet on my stomach, though I have had some appear on my breasts as they are seriously getting huuuge! I'm gonna start using it on my breasts too as the stretch marks I had from losing a lot of weight a few years ago seem to have diminished a little so looks like it's good for helping with existing stretch marks too!<br>  <br>  My bump has been growing steasily day by day since 19 weeks and is now double the size it was then and I had a bit of a bump then when I went for my scan! But then again it is twins so it's to be expected I suppose!<br>  <br>  I would expect yours to start growing more after 24 weeks and then again from about 28 weeks when it will just keep growing and growing until the day you pop out your bundle of joy!|`|98WKYtfwaa	it's nothing to do with if your mother got them and so on, it's to do with your skins elasticity. - That's to the user who said her midwife said you'll have the same as what your mother did.<br>  <br>  I've been using bio oil and some other creams, i've been using it religiously on my stomach and no stretchmarks, whereas i've got some on my boobs and i've not been oiling that area as much. <br>  <br>  I'm 22weeks too so i don't know much about the growth of our bumps, but i do know that when you reach about 28weeks you just start getting bigger and bigger. <br>  <br>  My midwife told me at 18weeks that my bump would probably stay that size until i reached about 24weeks, and she was right.

KOwzDLPdaa	It is possible that you are experiencing implantation bleeding! Which means you could be pregnant. Its very common, some women never see it and I am on pregnancy #3 and have had it each time.<br>  <br>  If for some reason this isn't your month and you do get your period, I would recommend and ovulation prediction kit which works like a pregnancy test only it tells you when you are about to ovulate based on a urine sample. That way you don't have too much sex and "deplete" your hubby's swimmers before your egg is released.<br>  <br>  I hope this help! Good luck :o)|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	it could have been implantation bleeding, take a test in a weeks time
hoDjyV3Vaa	Yes you could be and good luck. I got 3 positives when I was Only 2 weeks preggo.  I just got really sick and decided to take a random test sorry to say that it ended in a miscarriage at 8 weeks, but hubby and I are trying again.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	I am confused. You said the test was negative but you want to know if it was a false positive. Do you mean a false negative? Yes it can be that. It can also be that your period is just late and starting. If you see no more blood in the next 2 days test again.|`|iPGxXRHgaa	I had that with my 3rd son, i was a week late & tested but my test was positive, i then lost quite alot of brown discharge, thought i was miscarrying but everything was fine. I'd say test again|`|O7QyQl15aa	Sounds like implantation bleeding where the embryo latches on.   Sometime you can show a slight bleed when your period should have been, hope this helps?
CrmCHVI0aa	i know how you feel. the night before my 1st baby was born i had nasty contractions but they sent me home as only 2 cm dialated. had her the day after. i think you wont have long to wait now. maybe 2day or 2moro will be baby day! dont walk too far as you dont wanna be in proper labour in the street. when the pains get to every 5 mins, lasting for around 50 secs then it will be time to get back there. good luck!|`|3c8GsRvUaa	u have to be 6 cm  yes do a lor of walking|`|EyKJ737daa	Try tackling some stairs sweetie, that's what did it for me when they induced me!  Sounds like you are certainly in the very early stages of labour and I hope it doesn't last much longer.  Take some panadol/paracetamol if you need too as that is perfectly safe and may take the edge off the pain for you and make it a little more bearable.  Good luck though sweetie, doesn't sound like you will be waiting much longer, definitely try the stairs though and if you go for a walk, make sure you take someone with you and a mobile phone just in case!!|`|4jeqIx6Paa	tell me about it ! i been awake since yesterday i haven't been to sleep yet ! how sad ? i know i cant even sleep i start having contractions and i called doctor she said its nothing so i don't understand than why i cant do to sleep ! :( <br>  Im thinking about going to my OB in 2 hours to check for pre term labor because i 30 weeks and i know it has to be more than that !|`|98WKYtfwaa	It sounds like your baby is on it's way! When your contractions are 5mins apart, lasting a minute each time and are like this for an hour then that's when you should go back to hospital.<br>  <br>  Try walking alot, walking upstairs is good too. Drink alot of water and try to rest, i know it'll be hard but you want some energy for when the time comes.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Just give yourself time. If its labour you will not miss it, and anyway you are 4cm which is a good sign. Don't strain yourself though in trying to be active-you will need all the energy for pushing-all the best!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	yes do lots of walking but when u start to get tried stop and rest, drinks lots of water, it shouldnt be to long now|`|HN9FG9udaa	I went into labor at 37w3d. I had extreme lower back pain and went to labor and delivery the day before. The dr told me your 37 weeks preggo of course your going to have lower back pain. I went home at around 7:30 pm...and I was back in L&D around 5:30 the next morning. I was 3 cm at my 1st visit...and 5 at the 2nd visit. You will be going very very soon....Just sit back and relax because 5 cm is considered active labor!|`|BcjFssaEaa	yes walk walk walk that is by far the best thing to do it wont be long if ur waters havent broke then there is no reason 2 worry so walk n have a bath that can ease pain or bring contractions on.<br>  best of luck xx|`|no4tGa45aa	Gosh no dont walk! REST! If you walk all day today then how are you going to have the strength to go through labour and delivery? Sit down and watch a movie - your body will take care of it :)|`|AA12395149	I wish our hospital would send patients home on ambien or with a shot of morphine when they are in early labor.  We either admit and start pitocin, making them more miserable or send them home and tell them how to deal with the pain.  Sending a patient home with ambien helps them to sleep and either the early labor stops because it's not true labor and they get to relax a bit and then go into full blown labor and because they relaxed, they opened up quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Anyway, yes, walking around a lot today should help you to go into labor further, it will also help the baby's head to descend and the cervix to open.  You don't have to just walk though.  You can try doing squats (wide stance with your toes slightly turned out), if you have a yoga ball, sit on it and move your hips around in circles, side to side, front to back, side lunges to help stretch out your leg muscles.  Anything is better than being strapped to a monitor all day and night.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and you're almost there!

1JGj56TFaa	I weaned my son (now 5) at 12 weeks and my daughter (now 6 months) at 4 months.  On both occasions when i started weaning, milk was not satisfying them and i was having to increase the number of bottle feeds they were getting.  They were both quite unsettled prior to being weaned and I realise now it was because they were hungry! My son has no detrimental effects from being weaned earlier than the recommended age and so far, my daughter is fine.  When I was a baby (many many years ago!!!) my mother was advised to give me solids at 7 DAYS old!!!!!!  I think all this nonsense about waiting until 6 months is just ridiculous especially for 1st time mums.  Each baby is different and your gut instinct will tell you when you need to start spoon feeding.  Mummies know best!  Good luck x|`|iMaTMWMxaa	When my daughter was a baby (she is now 5) the advice was still 4 months for weaning. Looking back, she wasn't really ready and could have waited until she was 6 months. She kept pushing the food back out and didn't really want it.<br>  <br>  By the time I had my son 18 months later, the advice had changed to 6 months, but he was a huge baby and desperate for food. I weaned him at 4 months, and he immediately ate a small bowlful of food. By the time he was 6 months he ate a weetabix for breakfast.<br>  <br>  My youngest, who is nearly 2, I weaned at about 18 weeks, as I felt she was ready. She had always slept well, started waking and already had some teeth, so I started earlier than the recommended 6 months.|`|7lPspOboaa	I have 3 children.  The first was weaned at 18 months.  She began the process herself slowly.  As she ate food she wanted less milk, by 18 months she was only nursing at night.<br>  <br>  The second I weaned at 12 months.  His attitude was as long as I kept feeding him he didn't care what the source was.<br>  <br>  My third was weaned at 22 months.  (She is my last and I delayed it as long as possible.)  I started her at about 19 months.  I had to be firm with her because she didn't want to stop.<br>  <br>  Weaning is a personal choice.  At least 6 months is recommended.  However, the longer you nurse the longer your antibodies protect your child.  I have heard of people recommend 6 months but doctors recommend 1 year. As your son eats solid food you will naturally nurse less often.  Ultimately, if there is no health issues forcing your hand, the choice is yours and your husbands.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	just be for my baby was 4 months but he a really advanced<br>  look for your baby watching u eating and trying to copy , wanting more and more milk  being apple to support there head and controle there tounge and also lifting stuff up to there mouth|`|If6O5XHlaa	I started with my son at 3 months coz he was really hungry and milk just wasn't cutting it, he is 8 now and he is still eating like a horse!|`|758cDKEFaa	5 and half months, i felt like he needed the extra filling for sleeping during the night.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	First I have heard of that.

The WHO recommends 2 YEARS|`|BcjFssaEaa	i started weaning my daughter at 4 1/2 month s<br>  best of luck xx|`|PbBWJGsTaa	I started weaning my daughter when she was 5 months.  In retrospect, i know now that she wasn't ready (I don't think that it did her any harm, just that she didn't need it).  She didn't start grabbing for food and putting it her mouth, to chew and swallow until she was 8 months.  These are the signs that i will look for if I have another child.  If a baby is ready to eat, it will eat when food is OFFERED to it, not spooned into its mouth.|`|YHdjNv87aa	my baby is 4 months old now and i started to wean her about 4 weeks ago. i have started all my children at about 3-3 1/2 months. i have 7 children and started them all at this age. but all my babies have been big at birth. i also had the go ahead from my health visitor.|`|qcecsrDsaa	My wife stopped at 4 months, She pumped out into plastic bags that attached onto a bottle for two months.We have a healthy 15 yr old that is an an academic,athlete, blackbelt in American Kenpo Kartae<br>  and a 4.5 plus grade result.|`|fjZeVLOQaa	i started weanin at around 17 weeks on the advise of my health visitor,please ask first as it can cause damage if they r not ready if u are going to start use baby rice as it is gentle on their little stomachs|`|fJ7OeopSaa	5 months, tried at 4 months but was told to stop by health visitor|`|d8eee20fda121f62217d52ff24ab701eaa	My son was 4 months and so ready for more than milk.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I started at 12 weeks, when my baby showed all the "signs" that he was ready.<br>  <br>  Nine months later we discovered he has permanent digestion issues as a result.<br>  <br>  DON'T DO IT. It is not safe, and you won't know until it is far too late whether you are doing damage. The only reason you should wean before 6 months is if the medical risks of not doing so are worse than the medical risks of early weaning - which include diabetes and severe allergies. If you can possibly hold off for eight more weeks, please, please do so.|`|3qLIRorjaa	4/5 months. I started when milk alone wasn't satisfying him.|`|xGI9z01Maa	I only had my children nursing for a short time at least the first 6 week for each of them but I had issue with needing a 2 hour nap and being about to keep hydrated due to my body.  They had bottles and nursing after that for a time.  <br>  <br>  But my mother nursed us for longer(7 children).  About 2 years each.  But I know one of my brother had his last a about 4 year old but it was a one time thing after a very bad day.<br>  <br>  There is no correct age to wean a baby.  It's personal choose.  Each person is different and each child is different.  I was reading that this one women was nursing until the child went to Kindergarten but like they said in Sex in the City, "If he old enough to ask for it then it is time to stop nursing."  <br>  <br>  I believe that the first 6 weeks are the most important but after that then it is your choose.  But they say that you should use formula for the first year.  So you might want to look at the cost of formula which was about $10 per can when I had children that young and they drank 2 to 3 cans per week.  And this is a good reason to nurse until the baby is a year as any.  Breast milk is always better then other products.<br>  <br>  But if you are talking about food for the baby, then when the baby starts to cry and the nurse is not keeping her sleeping through the night.  For two of my children, it was 3 month.  For my one daughter it was about 4 months.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Just because a baby is grabbing at the food on your plate doesn't mean he/she is ready to be weaned. It just means they're curious and want to explore their environment. Keep up the breastfeeding until they are at least a year old. Keep in mind that 6 months is the minimum! Besides weaning now means formula why waste money on that when you have the good stuff that's always the right temp, takes no prep time and increases bonding between you and your little one? Please keep breastfeeding.|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	Heya, I weaned my little girl at 4 months, as she was always hungery and watching us eat and trying to grab onto our plates :) You can always try to wean and see how your little one takes to it. a little each day wont harm!! :) good luck xx|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Both my girls 4 months.
Cx5Zo7IIaa	I would concentrate on the children you already have. Ask yourself would the quality of their lives be significantly worsened by the birth of a new baby? What about the toll on your body, you just had a baby a year ago. Optimally you need two years between children for your body to recover. What about your living situation and all the material things a baby needs? Can you stretch yourself emotionally enough for all of your children? A baby requires an awful lot of attention. And what about you emotionally? Are you ready for another baby? What about your job? Can it handle you having another baby? <br>  These are the things you must ask yourself then you have to weigh the answers carefully and decide what is right for you, your situation and your family. <br>  If you are considering an abortion check out PlannedParenthood.org and ImNotSorry.net<br>  Email me if you need to talk.<br>  <br>  Oh and ladies when you are in her situation then you can say words like adoption!|`|3c8GsRvUaa	i would keep the baby and do what you need to do. it will be hard with 4 but nothing you can't handle i am sure. with child support , and day care from the state, food stamps it won't hurt but they're there for you when you need them.|`|8OeAPuzwaa	Poor darlin =( If you're in contact with your parents or other close family members you might want to rely on them a bit, be it financially or just for support and maybe minding the kids.<br>  <br>  I'm not really qualified to answer questions like these, but I remember when I had a scare, I was pretty sure I was going to keep it.

If it were me and my family were not willing to help me out (which is the only situation i can come up with where i would be able to keep the baby) then i would probably have an abortion - i couldnt go on with the thought of having my baby live with someone else and most likely never know him/her.  Even though i know a few ppl who have had an abortion and regretted it - but i just couldnt see myself going through nine mths of pregnancy and labour and then being able to give my baby up to someone else.. Hope you make the right choice for you and your family|`|BWUlksmmaa	I think you need to consider what support mechanisms you have in your life to help you get by.  Do you have friends and family that can help you out with your children, help tidy the house occasionally, help keep your spirits up, lend you an ear whenever you need to talk?  How about your work - are they flexible enough to give you time off when you need it?  Does your workplace stress you out, adding to the burden?  Are you financially ok to look after 4 children?  Abortion is your choice and I believe you need to think long and hard about your life and whether you can handle another child.  Noone should judge you whatever your decision is.  Best of luck.|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	Aww hun, dont have an abortion. Think of the love that you as a mother can give to this beautiful baby.

AA12395149	At 8 weeks they may or may not check for a heart beat.  Often times the heart beat is not detectable by doppler until about 9 or 10 weeks.  They will take your blood pressure, check your urine, go over what to expect at this stage of pregnancy and discuss any questions you may have.  If they've already done a blood test, then they probably won't do another until closer to 30 weeks (unless you want to do the AFP - screening for possible birth defects, that's around 16-18 weeks).  My technical first visit was at 6 weeks and wasn't with the doctor or nurse practitioner, it was you a quick prenatal preveiw with the office girl, then she gave me orders to take to a lab for a blood draw so they had the results by the time I had my first appointment with the doctor.  <br>  <br>  They do blood tests more frequently only if you were anemic on your initial prenatal labs or if you are showing signs that you may have difficulties with the pregnancy (which usually don't arise until after 20 weeks).<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and congratulations!|`|yDNv30Okaa	hi there, they will be able to check heart beat, it can be herd from about 6 weeks ish, so it should now be a strong sound, they will check urine, for infections (common in pregnancy) and also protein, they will also take bloods to check for infections, and hormone levels, and finallythey will do blood pressure, oh and they will press you tummy to check uterus position, this will be a little uncomfortable im afraid|`|sstNdyYVaa	the doctor will:<br>  -ask when your last period was and whether you have completely missed it<br>  -work out your due date<br>  -whether you did a preg test<br>  -she will examine yr tummy<br>  -she will take your blood pressure<br>  -yr height and weight<br>  -take a urine test to test for any infections<br>  -ask you whther you been on folic acid<br>  -ask you generally how you are and feeling and tell you about bad symptoms to look out for<br>  -paper work- referring a midwife, hospital, prescription free forms, give you magzines and leaflets<br>  <br>  - they wont check for a heartbeat cos ur baby is still tiny!<br>  <br>  I think thats about it, all the best<br>  xxx|`|FH2iKFcJaa	I had my first scan done at 9 weeks. I wanted to hear the babys heartbeat but was told that they cant check until 10 weeks because it is too faint to pick up. I also had a lot of blood work done and a urinalysis to check everything. I guess it depends where you go though.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	yes they check the heart beat and urine test every time you go in.|`|FegAXbgiaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I would take a urine sample with you, but the first appointment is for gathering information, and to get and edd ( expected due date).<br>  <br>  At this point in time your baby is still sitting behind the pubic bone and it doesnt appear from behind until 12 -13 weeks thats why the first scan is done then. Heartbeats are heard at the doctors or midwife appointments much later ( sorry). I was always eager to hear all my childrens heartbeats.

If they don't say they are not suitable for under 2s, then they have never been tested and you would effectively be using your child as an unlicensed medical guineapig.<br>  <br>  I'd speak to your doctor - I know kids who take prescribed liquid medicine for carsickness, but not what it is.

Your periods will be irregular if it continues to be really odd and your concerned, call your ob/gyn office for advice.|`|Iu0AJDviaa	Get a pregnancy test.|`|EyKJ737daa	With all three of my babies I got my first period at 8 weeks. My first was bottle fed (due to medical issues) and my 2nd and 3rd were breast fed but still got my periods at 8 weeks with both of them.  Your body may just be trying to sort itself out still as your hormones are still up in the air for the first 12 months I believe.  They can be heavy or light after birth and mine are certainly not regular, if anything they are now shorter cycles averaging around 24 day cycle and very heavy 2-3 days but have then generally for 6-8 days.  Every woman is different though, if for any reason you are concerned sweetie, a quick visit to your doctor will put your mind at ease.  All the best and good luck xx|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I am still breastfeeding my 8 month old and do not have a period yet! Most people have told me that they got theirs around the 6 month mark and that it took a few months to get a normal cycle <br>  There is no science to it, I would not say that it is in any way abnormal that you are experiencing this
EyKJ737daa	Ouch! Hmm our little darlings have no respect for their housing when being cooked do they?!  LOL!!! My 1st gave me 2nd degree tears and that was bad enough.  Thankfully though I didn't get anymore tears from my 2nd and 3rd labours.  I think a c-section may very well be a possibility for you now sweetie unless of course they do a medical and find that any stretching now would not effect that tear because the damage has already been done.  Good luck though, you're half way through the pregnancy and the rest will fly by especially if you have a 1 year old to chase around.  All the best and get some rest when you can, you'll certainly need it.  x
S5Lsbh0taa	Approach post adoptions in QLD, As far as I know they don't charge a person to inquire or register for searches. <br>  <br>  Also I've attached a website that might help you, I know its about adoptions but if you call the help lines they will point you in the right direction for searches. The best information is likely to come from her biological mother. If she has her birth certificate its a start in her search. Also her adoptive parents might be able to help in this too. (Just because their her parents doesn't mean they're scared of her searching, don't fall for the stereotype images people give you.) <br>  Also have you considered he may not know about her existence? lots to think about here.<br>  All the best!|`|gPg7qYGIaa	the only ways to find out is by asking her mother once u have the fathers name u can search bebo , Friends reunited stuff like that but remember it may not be a  happy ending the father may not want to know her or maybe  a horrible person  he may have a family and just say she not his so think carefully be for u go looking if u can cope with it if it not like u thought it would be|`|Tjr9aObNaa	If her mother hasn't named him on the birth certificate then there isn't much to do. She will need to get his name from her mother and then a cheap way of trying to find him would be via facebook/myspace, or google searches. If he isn't named on the birth certificate though he won't be listed anywhere else on any records so she better ask mum or some other relative.

I took 50 mg on day 5-9, for the first month and then 50 mg on day 4-8 the second and third month.  I got pregnant the third month on it!  I now have a beautiful 5 month old little girl.<br>  <br>  If you do not get pregnant this month, do not get discouraged.  It generally takes a few months to get pregnant on clomid.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend using preseed as well.  It is a lubricant that creates a friendly environment for his boys to swim in.  I used it the third month on clomid when I got pregnant, and really think it helped me.  You can buy it at www.preseed.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!
9J1Sl6X6aa	When you are overdue your AF gets less and less, that's why they don't allow you to go more than 14 days over your due date because it can be dangerous for the baby. <br>  <br>  My mum was 2 weeks overdue with me 30 years ago. The AF had disappeared so they had to do a C-Section to get me out of there as babies can't thrive very long without AF.<br>  <br>  So I think it's very normal when you're 10 days overdue that there wouldn't be much left of the fluids in there.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby boy!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	It's impossible. It would have been a medical emergency much earlier in your pregnancy if you'd had no AF.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Your baby couldn't have survived with no amniotic fluid.  They always measure your fluid when they do your u/s to make sure your have enough.  If, this was true, you would have had a dry birth which your baby would have probably not made it.  Are you sure?|`|IPALUs7qaa	I had a c-section, and although my water was broken artificially by the doctor, it didn't all come out in one huge gush, it just leaked for awhile. Anyway, when I had the c-section there would still have been water in there, but yes they vacuum it out when they take out the placenta and other stuff before they stitch you back up so nothing to worry about :-) Your water doesn't have to break before you have a baby. It would have just come out during the operation. I don't think a baby would survive without amniotic fluid!! It's what they swim around in and gulp down! It does get lesser towards the end of the pregnancy but I was 12 days overdue and still had plenty!|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Are you sure the doctors didn't suction it away like they do for all c-sections?  You would have had something in there or the baby would have been not very well.  Even when your waters break, your body still makes more, so there is always some in there.|`|rrtqwO9Waa	my mum had a dry birth with my brother she gave birth vaginally and there was nothing wrong with him, it can happen, i'm quiet sure there would have been some sort of lubrication surrounding the baby but not enough for anyone to realise.|`|q4FlSBL5aa	Wow that's really odd.<br>  When i had my daughter i had next to no fluid but there was still a bit..<br>  All i can say is consider yourself lucky to have your son :):)
H2IqzG12aa	It's perfectly normal, especially at this age.  I would say no to punishment.  I think that sends the wrong signal, makes the wrong association.  He just needs to understand that the people aren't typical (they're cast for those roles specifically because their "characteristics" are far beyond average) and can easily create false, unrealistic expectations.  Nevertheless, he needs to take responsibility for looking when he's not supposed to henceforth.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	just monitor his computer time for a good month or so.

Putting our foot down? Diciplining this behavior? Okay, so when we were kids there was no internet to find this stuff...but there were magazines....and if the dad owned some it could be very easy for a kid to get his hands on it....my brother did, and guess what? my parents reprmanded him for it and told him it was not okay to look at that stuff until he was an adult. (he was in 2nd grade too BTW then he found it..so I don't think he was grounded..but he was reprimanded for sure )|`|EmOnt7FIaa	It's better him look at porn than being out there actually having sex and catching STD's and getting people pregnant.<br>  <br>  Don't punish him.|`|dqw1iH6haa	family discussions will never be substitute for porn.

And you should question him about it.<br>  The right age to be looking at porn is 18 otherwise it's illegal.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Honestly there's nothing much you can do,Hes already seen the  P0rn ,Once hes seen it there's no going back,Hes a bit young but I've heard of similar situations ,Just teach him about Safe $ex and all that stuff.Maybe try grounding him from the computer for 2 weeks.And his video games,That'sl maybe teach him a lesson.But I must admit it is normal.Things have changed since you were a kid.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wnVGeG8uaa	He shouldnt be punished, I am sure he is just curious, I would be concerned if he was watching fetish porn videos, but if he is just looking at a naked women, he shouldnt get in trouble.

Of course he is going to look at porn. You might as well ground your daughter for getting periods and liking boys.

A simple solution would be to change the first name to Leigha or Leah, I found both spellings in my baby name book and it gives the name a slightly more feminine sound.|`|bIaywrBCaa	the 2 names do not go well together. How about Leah Rae or Letitia Rae? You could still call her Lee or Leigh|`|eSOzKj0Waa	I think it's adorable, and really pretty :)<br>  <br>  However, if you want it to sound more feminine (so people will know that it's a girl) how about Leah Rae? That would be soo cute, and sounds really feminine, but still very similar to Leigh! Or, even Leigh Rose or Leah Rose would be great names too :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|61NKzPzMaa	Awful. Awful. Awful.<br>  <br>  I agree with your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Both Lee & Ray are masculine BOYS names regardless of how you spell the names.<br>  <br>  Poor little girl.|`|7XIWtNr6aa	I actually don't like the name at all. I think it does sound like a boys name when it's spoken but the spelling is feminine.|`|D9IbINdFaa	I don't like it|`|Xb7CPz5naa	Leigh Rae is a nice name and it does sound really pretty...........If anyone thinks that it is a boy's name just tell them that that it's not and that it's a girl's name. There are loads of names that can be used for girls and boys like tori and ashley and yet ashley is one of my fave names !! I think that your boyfriend should have a say but don't let him totally change your mind completely....leigh Rae is very nice name but if your boyfriend doesn't agree with it you could go for something like this name but not the exact same like leigh-anne or something like that.It doesnt really matter what other people think (im not meaning ur boyfriend here ) it's up to yu and so what if people don't like it here are some name ideas and i hope they help !

XnmFz3Pqaa	You could be pregnant if you had sex during your ovulation period.  That is the key in getting pregnant that a lot of people fail to think about.  You have to have sex during those dates to get pregnant and because you did this you have a very good chance at being pregnant.  As far as you have symptoms, these could be symptoms, yes...and they could also be symptoms of a period coming...but we'll cross our fingers for pregnancy symptoms.  lol :o)<br>  <br>  Good luck!  If not, try again next month...keep up with the ovulation date.  This site worked for me detecting my ovulation date...IF you aren't pregnant and want to try it!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/p/163/index22.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/p/163/ind...</a>|`|b9uOax0aaa	Too early to tell.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Sure they could be symptoms! But only a test will tell! Good luck :)
7uVlYPEIaa	Twin pregnancies are 1 in 89 now anyway. We have two sets of twins, one set fraternal, one identical, and neither me or his ex-wife had any history of twins in the family, nor did we take drugs. Fraternal twins are genetic, identical twins just happen. Seeing you have a family history your chances of having twins are higher than any other woman, but you may still only have all singletons seeing that half of your genetic material also comes from your father, if he has no history of women over-ovulating and having twins in his family. No one can answer this question, they have not found the chromosome that carries the over-ovulation gene and be able to test to see if you have it.|`|XTf9VaLoaa	twins are ment to skip a generation
pzLDXL6gaa	That's one of the worst pills to miss because it extends the placebo break, I can't give you a percentage chance but pregnancy is possible so I recommend you use condoms for a week just to lower your chances.<br>  <br>  Harriet

Pick another one!|`|61NKzPzMaa	The proper spelling is Emmett. Please use the proper spelling. <br>  <br>  1 - I love the name Emmett<br>  2 - Emmett James? Emmett Logan?<br>  3 - You can't convince your spouse. Just suggest the name Emmett and see what your spouse says.|`|fPJTZwoUaa	hate it  hate it hate it   EM it     0r      E mit   <br>  <br>  please dont name ur child this name its really awful and horriblwe <br>  <br>    ( thats my opinion   and i agree with ur husband its awful )|`|8mchLCQhaa	I know this is not the correct spelling but I like the name<br>  <br>  Emmett Oliver<br>  Emmit David<br>  Emit Sawyer|`|c51ed3fd68dbbc18322e2b41a772c974aa	Don't like, sounds like you're emitting toxic fumes or something...|`|MoaIQPvCaa	I think you may want to check the dictionary, because you are considering naming your child Emit (starting with a long E sound) which could be a real problem in the future.<br>  <br>  As far as the name Emmett (starting with a short E sound), it is a nice name.|`|g27LbLQsaa	Don't like the spelling, could cause problems ...imagine his new teacher calling out his name for the first time and saying it like its spelt E-MIT, instead of Emmett like I asume you would pronounce it? Then when people say to him "What's your name ?" and go to write it down he will ALWAYS have to spell it our for people when it sounds so simple!!<br>  Jacob, Jordan, Samuel, Ethan?|`|PaEZeZxhaa	I personally really don't like it!<br>  <br>  Check out the attached link, it's got lot of good advice.<br>  Good luck choosing!|`|Mkok6omUaa	1.

Emmett Connor, Emmett Douglass, Emmett Clayton
145RUNQHaa	There is possibility there is a medical condition for this so push your doctor on that one.it could be a psychological reason such as acute anxiety i would most definately not punish him in any way for this it will make it worse.be patient don't make a fuss just calmly clean him up each time act like nothing happened.he sounds like he is really going through it so i would get to the bottom of it even if it means seeing a psychiatrist.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Are you saying that your son makes himself throw up every day when you leave him in daycare?  And he throws up twice every night?<br>  I would get a second and third opinion, you need to see a specialist to make sure he doesn't have reflux or some other digestive problem.  That isn't good for his esophagus and teeth, and it isn't good for him because he's going to be malnourished.<br>  <br>  If you really come to the conclusion that he's doing it for attention, you may need to stop changing his sheets at night.  It truly won't hurt him to have a little throw up on him, and he may quickly decide it isn't worth it.  And you may need to reconsider your daycare.  He may be doing it because he's stressed, and at 2 he just doesn't have the verbal skills to tell you what's going on.  There could be another child who is bullying or hurting him, or there could be something going on with one of the daycare workers.|`|oWdNHaRGaa	hey,<br>  my advice is to take him to the doctors there could be something wrong with him|`|MlCWsBcwaa	If it is not a medical thing, it does sound like attention is possible (have only seen it once in a toddler I used to babysit as a kid though).  Have you tried just wiping the sick up and leaving him with the smelly sheets?  Might sound mean, but if it is that he can turn it on, maybe he can turn the vomiting off too.  How about a night light or something soothing like that?  Is he active all day and worn out at night?  Maybe there is more scope for tiring him out so he is less inclined to night activity.  Maybe it is a matter of him growing out of it too.  I would cut back on the washing somehow for you somehow.  Even if you put a towel or some sort of sheeting on top, rather than nice new sheets that you have to wash in two lots.  Good luck.|`|PaEZeZxhaa	Have the doctors really excluded any medical problem? If it were me I'd really want to make this is not a medical problem and I'd push the docs for answers.<br>  <br>  If it's not medical, then the only reason I can think of him doing it would be for attention seeking. How do you react when he makes himself sick? What kind of attention do you give him?<br>  <br>  If you are sure it is not medical, then I would advise giving him zero attention for this, as hard as it may be. Do what you need to do to clear up but ignore him, totally. If he does it for attention seeking, this is the only way to stop it in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!
HclKftzAaa	no. if it was just an accident, then fine. but if he hadn't been screwing around- and TAKING MY KIDS TO MEET HIS WHORE- then the whole thing wouldn't have happened. I would leave simply because he was cheating. And he would not see the other child anymore either.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I completely agree with you Mama. There's no way on this planet I would forgive, or heck forget. Tragic yes, but completely avoidable.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	AH!  All I can say is that this is one of my persistent fears with a stroller with the sunshade down on a windy day.  That the wind will catch it and blow it into the street.<br>  <br>  It's pretty easy to tell if it's windy enough for this to be a possibility, because as you're pushing it along, the wind will grab it and make you go faster, or need to struggle.<br>  <br>  Mistress or no, this was stupid, stupid, stupid and unforgivably careless.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	No. I would never forgive him and they would probably have to put a restraining order out against me so I didn't kill him myself. Even that might not do the trick. <br>  <br>  I understand that accidents happen and can be a tragedy for everyone involved but if my husband caused the death of one of my children due to negligence there would be hell to pay.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I would not forgive him in a million years. He caused the death of one of my children due to his affair and stupidity. He can go live with the guilt of knowing his affair caused the death of his own child and ruined a marriage. <br>  <br>  How stupid could this guy get? The picture of where it took place is shocking. Why the hell would you let go of a stroller when the ground you are standing on slopes into the sea? I would never forgive this man.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I read this in the papers a couple weeks back.  I could never forgive him.  Bad enough he had an affair, that alone I couldn't forgive.  But that he killed my child because he was too busy kissing his bit on the side to keep hold of the buggy?  I'd want him castrated.<br>  <br>  He'll never forgive himself for it, so how could he expect his wife to be able to forgive?  He caused the toddler's death through his own carelessness and selfishness.  You're right, what kind of man takes his children to meet up with his mistress?|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Since he didn't do it on purpose or through negligence I think yes I could.<br>  But what a terrible tragedy.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I could never ever not in a million years forgive my husband. The affair would hurt, but you would get over it. Losing my precious baby would be a wound that would never heal. Just hearing this story actually make me a little teary eyed, how could someone be so careless with their babies. He was obviously more into his **** then his own two children otherwise this wouldn't have happened. The is an accident that could have been  easily prevented.<br>  <br>  I love my husband, but I would wish him a thousand deaths if something like this happened to my baby.|`|xEXb96UKaa	i could never forgive him. under different circumstances like the wind blowing the buggy out of his grip while he was just taking a normal walk, i would of course forgive him and we could support each other. but not if he let go of the buggy with the most precious little things in the world strapped in it, to kiss his mistress.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Hmm it takes a lot to forgive.... <br>  <br>  The affair aside for one moment...I could forgive him because he tried in vain to rescue his daughter and he has to live with her death on his shoulders for the rest of his life. As will his mistress.<br>  <br>  However I cannot be too judgemental as to the affair bit. My self and my fiance are only together because of an affair due to personal reasons and our marriages breaking down before we had an affair.<br>  <br>  Lots of women would split from their partner in this case but some women don't. Each to their own. <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe I could forgive but never forget and Im sure he wont either.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	As much as I'd try to understand, I dont think I could. He didn't necessarily do it on purpose, but it couldve been avoided. Like a drunk driver killing someone. It was the actions that caused the person to pass away, but it could have been stopped.|`|UghJ0XROaa	had it been purely an accident not involving a mistress, then yes, but considering the fact that he was with a mistress and killed my child in the process, i can't say what i would do to this man without losing my Y!A access|`|lGcpXteaaa	omg..that is horrible. And may i add that woman is CRAZY!!<br>  <br>  Well i have to say that you would find me the next day on the front page "Wife murders husband" lol!<br>  <br>  I would have never spoken to him ever again, let alone tried to work it out...what an idiot.<br>  <br>  Just like my friend...her new boyfriend got caught sexually abusing her 5 month old after she caught an infection in her vagina...She nearly died. My friend was aloud to keep her baby if she stayed away from the 'boyfriend'...she was caught seeing him again and got her two kids taken away..thankfully.<br>  I think its awful that some mothers are just so blinded by men...i will never take my mans side over my kids, i think its idiotic!!|`|vOomJtbsaa	No, that's horrible!! I would have a hard time forgiving a man that wasn't faithful to begin with, but to top it off he brought the kids along with his mistress there, and was so insensitive as to be affectionate with this woman in front of his children.  What I want to know is what kind of woman would EVER meet up with a married man with his children present??  This whole story makes my stomach turn.  And as a result of the his deceit, his daughter is dead.  Wow!! What a piece of work this man is!!   I would NEVER forgive such a transgression, in fact I'd be tempted to hurt a man that would ever do this, not stay with him.    I think once this lady gets over the shock of the loss of her daughter, she'll leave his sorry A**, there will be too much resentment on her part to work things out, it would just be too hard.   This is a sad, sad situation.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Forgive him yes, forget NO, stay with him ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!  Forgiveness wouldn't for him, it'd be for me so that I didn't walk through the rest of my life weighted down by bitterness.  It's bad enough I'd have to grieve the death of my child and watch my precious baby lay in a hospital bed.  I'd never stay with a man that's negligence and infidelity lead to the death of my child.  Him and his mistress should be dropped into a freezing lake....disgusting PIG!|`|f4zg7LHLaa	could i forgive the man who caused the death of our child because he couldn't keep it in his pants? not a chance in hell. <br>  i think i would end up in jail if i got my hands on him.<br>  <br>  i couldn't forgive him even having an affair, never mind that affair being the reason our child was dead. i would never let him have unsupervised access with the other child either.|`|APrvPTsNaa	I would do my best to forgive him for my own sake, but the marriage would end immediately. Yes, he has to live with what he's done, but so does the mother. To lose your children must be the worst pain in the world.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	id never forgive him, for cheating, for killing my child (although not directy) im sorry shes a bigger woman than i could ever be, i just dont knwo how on earth i would be able 2 control myself.<br>  <br>  i agree with u hunni xxxxxx|`|50lIaC8zaa	OMG how awful, i hadn't heard about it.

For having the affair in the first place and Even thinking it was ok to bring the children to meet his mistress. He should've kept his pants on and stayed home with those kids on such a bad windy day. I do not see how this man could live with the guilt of being what helped killed his child. Like a few other said. There would be a big price to pay for something like this happening to my child. If my husband were here and the roles reversed. He would say the same thing I did. Actually he would also say they would have no chance to even go to jail. Bc they would be dead =/|`|qdFrJ21waa	Yikes! I read the article and looked at the picture of the scene....I don't think I would go anywhere near a slopping drop like that, even without a baby! Especially with anything that had wheels on it. <br>  <br>  Alas, it still was an accident, albeit a preventable one. If she can forgive him then good for her. The mistress part would be more unforgivable for me since the buggy going over really was an accident and surely the father is devastated. Like others have said, the reason for it happening is the worse part.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	I couldn't forgive him, even if I wanted to. What a terrible, terrible story. What kind of man takes his kids to see his mistress? I'm looking at the newspaper clip and thinking... How can he let go of the buggy knowing how deadly that drop is. I would be having bad feelings of even being *near* that cliff with my daughter... even if both of my hands were on the stroller. Now he has to live with a lifetime of guilt of killing his daughter, all because of his infidelity.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Sounds like this woman is in so much shock.  She has had to come to terms with loosing her child and potentially loosing her husband too.<br>  She may well be blaming herself for what happened.  "what if they had stayed with me today" or "what have I done to make my husband go off with another woman"<br>  Such a terrible story and incredibly hard for both of them to live with for the rest of their life's.<br>  Such an event can definitely make or break a relationship.<br>  I could not stay with a man that cheated on me and caused the death of my child no way|`|no4tGa45aa	I really dont think i could.  He killed my baby just so he could kiss his lover "The buggy just ran away from them on a sloping bit of the pathway, and that was it. It just slipped away from them" if they had of been holding it like all normal ppl then Rebecca wouldnt have died. i dont think i would ever get over that he killed my child or be able to look at him the same. Thats so sad.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	No way, If he weren't abandoning his children to tongue his mistress maybe, but seeing that he was too busy having his tongue down his girlfriends throat, instead of keeping hold if his babies like he should, he should be strapped into a shopping cart and thrown into the ocean, just my opinion.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	I could never forgive that! even if he was not having an affair it was an accident that should'nt have happened. a child is the most precious life in the world and when they are in the care of an adult that adult should do everything to ensure that that child is safe.|`|U9SeBG7Zaa	I could forgive the affair, not unsimilar to my own situation.

I personally would want to kill him but that is just me!<br>  <br>  What is worse for me is that he was openly having an affair in front of his 2 children anyway. What if that little girl had told mummy that daddy was kissing another lady?<br>  <br>  Thought they both tried to save the children that does not excuse what they did. Because of them that little girl is dead. If they had been concentrating on the children then this would never have happened.
iIVnndPzaa	yep i had that too... it was also very hard for hubby to put his fingers in very very blocked i don't know why but it was painful up until 14 dpo.. good luck
CrmCHVI0aa	you can take a test from the day of your missed period, so your not testing 2 early. i would do another test and if its neg then go to docs to have a blood test and go from there. good luck|`|JjBwydymaa	leave it for a few days and test again.. he may have been that you did test too early.<br>  <br>  Good luck hunni xx|`|d1csiCLKaa	Test again in another few days time hun|`|hlWdFTcjaa	Don't give up hope! It could be that your HCG levels aren't high enough for a HPT to pick up, they get higher each day. So test again in about a week, if still negative go see you doctor! Good luck and baby dust to you sweet!|`|Emu6AG6caa	just try again in aweek or go to the doctors to get a blood test that will soon tell ya.
NfbDQ1tYaa	itested 9DPO and got a faint, iv only got a dark positive now at 16DPO........my cycles are confusing tho, i only ovulated on day 28 of my cycle, and only did it once the day b4 i ovulated so i dont know, from what i know it was 9DPO.|`|gH21CXkSaa	your 15 dpo should have came up positive by now, but everyone is different. When I tested I was 18 dpo and it came up positive before the test was even finished giving the results. You can test as early as 8 dpo and but most positives are very faint at that time.|`|iIVnndPzaa	it's safe to say .. after your period... but i've heard of women getting a positive result at about 8 dpo|`|mjlb5JWEaa	I was 2 months when i found out hun.

OzK10hKxaa	Hehe, what's with all thes pregnancy questions from people :-P<br>  <br>  It's good for you and the baby to be out enjoying yourself. If you don't rest the ball on your stomach... not that you would! then there's no problem. Use a light ball that you can easily pick up, and you risk no injury. <br>  <br>  The only risk of injury from bowling is falling over, but that could happen everywhere. I'm sure you appreciate the fathers concerns, but you can't live in a bubble, because when you do that, you risk a bigger injury - depression surrounding the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  So to sum it up, don't rest the ball on you, use a light ball that you could pick up with 1 finger and it's absolutely fine.<br>  <br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  As for the person who was told "doctors said bowling was bad for your stomach muscles" <br>  <br>  Let's see why that argument is ridiculous...<br>  <br>  Bowling uses your BACK, not your STOMACH/ABDOMINALE MUSCLES.<br>  <br>  Whoever has a sore stomach after bowling?<br>  A sore forearm maybe. But stomach? Hmmm... no.<br>  <br>  Pro bowling players don't have ripped 6 pack abs... quite a few have a gut though..|`|kP3Ryfyuaa	I had two friends that got pregnant and both are dancers and when they asked the doctor how active they could be with dance, he told them they can do anything they are doing right now, the only thing they couldnt do was go bowling. That was two different docs. Appearently its bad for your muscles in your stomach. I dont know how bad it is, but I bet you will be sore tomorrow!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	I went bowling when I was pregnant, I think I was about 6/7 months. I used the lightest ball they had, 6 or 8 pounds. And when I started to feel sore, I stopped. It's kinda akward and I only went the one time but I'll never do it again, it made me really sore!|`|2GXgT981aa	The last time I went bowling (aside from being nearly 5 years ago...), I was with a friend who was 5-6 months pregnant at the time.  She was fine, and her baby was born on time and healthy.  I really don't see how bowling could hurt your baby at all.  It would be possible to hurt YOURSELF, but  you'd have to be pretty spastic and pull a muscle in your back or stomach or something.<br>  <br>  As long as it's not an undue strain on you (which bowling generally isn't),or your doctor told you not to lift heavy objects, there shouldn't be anything wrong with it.|`|W1p6LetFaa	You aren't at risk of hurting the baby from bowling.  The only concern is that you might somehow hurt yourself, which would suck.  If you hurt your back, you'd be in for a very long pregnancy, because it's not like your back will be feeling better any time soon.  So I wouldn't recommend bowling again.  But if you don't feel sore or anything, don't worry about it!  For the most part, your body will tell you what you should and shouldn't do, ya know?  Just be careful not to do something that might hurt your back, cuz that back will most likely be hurting on it's own soon enough!  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	nooo i dont think soo,, but make sure that the ball is not very heavy
4d8420be4f044c1627ede2b5585dd409aa	What does it matter now? You've already made your decision and can't change it. Don't dwell on it, just make sure your mom knows that you care about her and make her some soup or hot chocolate or something cute! I'm sure she isn't mad at you.|`|pTERJdzQaa	Yes, you definitly without a doubt did the right thing because it sounds like your dad is going through more[I dont truly know that because Im not there, Im just making an Inference from the details.<br>  <br>  Isn't your Dad's mother your grandmother?, If she is then yes you did because you went to her funeral.|`|9zwSclnLaa	I think so, you were gone what?  Not all that long and I'm sure your mom didn't mind having some time alone just to rest and have some peace and quiet :)|`|nZVmkZSBaa	You did what was right for you. You wanted fun.. You didn't care about your mom. =]|`|QQE58qFQaa	I say you made the right decision... it really meant alot to your dad and he did just lose his mother... he needed the support, our mother will always get another cold for you to take care of..|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Since I have 2 brothers.<br>  <br>  I would of gone with dad, and my brothers stayed home.<br>  <br>  Sooory about your grandma|`|8VotkEXHaa	I would have gone with your Dad too.  Your mom doesn't need to have someone home 24/7 if she just had a cold.  I would say you made the right choice :)
e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	Wonderful answers from ILoveMySon and Lala - not much I can add ;o)<br>  <br>  Tringled shaped are excellent and very elegant for the smallest breasts - one thing I did not understand is what you mean by "support".. If you have really small "boobs" you are doing fine without any "support"?<br>  <br>  Good point from Lala about young girls with much padding - that just looks awkward. Much better a triangled bra in some nice colours and maybe some pattern ;) That's really beautiful, and makes the girl so pleasant because she is not trying to pretend something.<br>  <br>  But in short, triangled are perfect - but I don't understand the "support" part. Good thing about small is to not need support ;o)|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	yep they are all fine<br>  just get the right size like check a calculator i you are 34 A or whatever at this point any bra is ok and you are safe from saggy boobs still as they are small hooray ( i love my small boobies-I am an adult )|`|zdWDkadraa	Well you start off at the smallest sizes so usually they only have the triangle ones or the tube like ones. I personally started with the tube ones that had a light padding in them to add a bit of size. You probably won't need support until you have larger boobs anyways.<br>  <br>  I know a lot of younger girls will buy the bigger padded ones, but with no boobs to hold them in place, they usually look odd. Anyone can tell they aren't filled with anything so it's best to go with the size you are. Just buy anything but a bra that's a million sizes too big!

2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	I have one.  I haven't gained any weight.  The only problems I have with it is it's been 5 months and my period hasn't stopped(stops within the first 6 months most of the time), my periods are heavier, longer, and more painful (but that could be from having a child, not too sure), and my husband says he feels it sometimes(even though most people say their mates can't feel it.)  It's great birth control if you have trouble remembering to take pills or anything like that.  If you're good at remembering to take pills, etc. then stick with the pills.|`|c869895f8cb09fe2da1a591b8fd2a2f7aa	I used the Mirena IUD.  I've heard that periods can stop while using it, but mine never did.  During the fourth year, they did shorten from six days down to three.  I didn't gain any weight with it like I did with the Depo Provera shot.  I did feel some minor cramping like a period when it was put in, but it lasted about two hours after I got home.  My husband was able to feel the strings once in a while, but not that often.  If that happens, the doctor can always cut them a little shorter.  You're supposed to check for the strings after every period, but sometimes because of having sex or using tampons, the strings would curl up, and you'd have to try a little harder to feel for them.  I got pregnant with it a month before I was due to have it changed, but my doctor thinks it's because the hormones got too low to prevent pregnancy.  I had it removed, but there is a 25% chance of miscarriage with it.  Despite that, I'm planning on having it inserted again after the birth of this baby, but my husband's also planning on getting a vasectomy, so we'll be doubly protected.  I would recommend it, but it may not be for everyone.

FMmncxToaa	By tracking your ovulation, which for you would be around day 14. Wheyou have an raw egg white consistency, if you feel twinges in your ovary, that means you're about to ovulate.Also, try to relax and enjoy the moment, because if you start doing the deed just for that purpose, it will take you longer, as stress delays ovulation.Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!!!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Pick up a 7 day ovulation prediction kit. It tells you when to start, then you test the same time each day for 7 days, just like a pregnancy test. It will tell you by detecting a hormone that you ovulation is just around the corner. have sex every 1-3 days and once you get a positive test, do it everyday!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

Si hay gente que te discrimina eso no esta bien. Pero sabes que? hay de todo en el mundo. O se asi como hay gente insensible qeu te discrimina seguro hay gente qeu te aprecia y quiere. Sera que tu no lo puedes ver pues tu mismo pones trabas cuando te desmereces tanto. Si solo no lo puedes superar y realmente tienes ganas de que esto suceda, por que  no recurres a hacer una terapia para tratar tu problema de aceptacion contigo mismo? Yo creo que primero debes empezar por eso: o sea aceptarte a ti mismo con dicho defecto. Una vez logrado te importara nada la discriminacion, estaras  mas seguro de ti y podras emprender muchas relaciones ya sean amistosas o amorosas. No te des tan poco credito. Y  no te castigues de ante mano tanto. Si logras enamorarte de alguien y ella de ti y si en un futuro tiene hijos ellos te aceptaran como eres, sin dudas. Pero todo, absolutamente todo dependera de la actitud que tu tomes al respecto. pero si sigues tan mal al punto de ni siquiera aceptar que te acepten como tu dices pues entonces todos los esfuerzos seran en vano. Te repito: empieza por hacer algo para aceptarte primero a ti mismo con tu defecto, el resto vendra solo.

Es como ser: más bajo, más flaco, más gordo, *****, blanco, tener voz gruesa o fina, etc, etc, etc. sabes cuántas personas son distintas en éste mundo y ni hablar de lo que no se ve: la maldad, la envidia, la agresión, el abandono, etc, etc. No crees que ésto sí es terrible? <br>  Respecto a no tener hijos, creo estas equivocado. deberías hacerte algún tipo de estudio con un profesional para saber si es genético (es decir, si lo pueden heredar tus hijos, o no).<br>  Y a partir de esto, recién tomar una decisión).<br>  Ojalá ésto te ayude!! Piensa que la expresión de sentimientos no sólo es a traves de la palabra, lo son las caricias, una mirada, una sonrisa, una invitación, una flor, la bondad, y tantas otras cosas que puedes crear vos mismo.<br>  Mira cuántas cosas tienes para vivir una vida feliz y te detienes en una sola.

Tengo un amigo que es tartamudo y nunca les falto amigos ni novia, hizo la secundaria y con el tiempo, por decisión de él, quiso consultar con un psicologo y empezar un tratamiento con un foniatra.<br>  Creo que deberías ver bien si este problema tuyo no es una forma de excluirte y alejarte de los demas.<br>  Y por último creo que el deseo de no ser padre no tiene que ver con esto, si no queres tener hijos está bien, pero el justificativo no debería ser por esto.-<br>  Suerte!!!!|`|bIZRvXRUaa	Bueno la verdad no se tu edad, pero asi como lo comentas me imagino que tienes unas 26 a?os por ahi ...pues tu tienes el libre albedrio de decidir tener hijos o no.Si alguien te ama te aceptara tal cual, yo solo puedo sentir empatía por tu penar pero deberias de aceptarte  tí mismo y reirte de tí vive con ello, si asi lo deseas aunque la fé mueve monta?as, pidele a Dios tosos los dias en sanar, y darle las gracias para poderte comunicar, trasciende los problemas, no son maldiciones, cada persona cada alma tiene una mision en esta vida, te estas autocriticando a ti mismo, aceptate tal cual y los demas te aceptaran, aunque no es importante que los demas te acepten porque al unico que tenemos que agradar es a Dios..

Si quieres dejar de tartamudear anda a un psicologo y trata de desenvolverte mas, y que te valga lo que los demas digan de ti, lo importante es que a esa persona que escojas para estar contigo la ames y ella te ame, al final ella va ver tu interior y no tus defectos.|`|cHRg2F9Taa	Lo que no es justo es que tu mismo te sientas menos eso no es justo se siempre seguro de ti y de lo que desees como tu te sientas te veran los demas RECUERDA QUE TODOS SOMOS IGUALES LOS QUE TIENEN EL PROBLEMA SON LOS QUE CRITICAN , lo importante siempre son los sentimientos no el fisico ese no nos dura toda la vida y los sentimientos si, cuidate mucho y se feliz que DIOS te bendiga y te ayude a ser mas seguro suerte|`|2bm6k8nRaa	oye amigo <br>  las posibilidades  de que tus hijos salgan tartamudos es muy poca  pero yo siempre he creído que hay un roto para un descosido . ya encontraras a tu media naranja  no te desesperes las cosas llegan cuando menos  nos la imaginamos <br>  te voy a decir algo si mi padre fuera tartamudo A mi no me  importarian esas cosas  no  yo lo querría igual o hasta mas de verdad  te lo digo con el corazon  y me pudes decir  quien es perfecto en esta vida absolutamente nadie, no te concentres en lo desafortunado que  eres por ser tartamudo si no concentrate por que estas  vivo  y hablas caminas y puedes hacer muchisismas cosas  en fin te prodia decir una mega lsita de lo que si  puedes hacer y de tu gran potencial ,que otros solo sue?an en poder hacer y te aseguro que ellos nos e lamentan tanto como tu solo  da le gracias a Dios por  lo que tienes y no le  reproches por lo que no <br>  y de verdad yo no croe que sea un defecto como tu le llamas tan despectivamente <br>  <br>  animo  amigo y mucha suerte!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   ???butterfly???|`|ci7cqbeGaa	No creo q ese defecto sea para tanto, es mas, no lo veo como un defecto.

Say that you have had a talk to your own daughter about contraception and wanted to do the same with her. See if she confesses. <br>  If she doesn't then you will have to break the confidence and say you know, upsetting your daughter comes way down on the list next to a pregnant teenager. Tell her you know and you want to help her, that if she doesn't start being more careful you will tell her mum.

If she came to your daughter, then obviously she trusts her. Maybe you could give your daughter condoms to give to your niece so that it's less conspicuous than just giving them to her yourself. Or one day when your niece is over without her mother you could kind of casually and openly bring up sex like you do with your daughter. Don't make it awkward and don't single her out but just go over all the risks of sex (pregnancy, STD's etc.) and make sure she knows that she can always come to you if she needs help or wants to go on Birth Control or something.

S5Lsbh0taa	Stats are showing children who are adopted fair better than kids who are left in foster care. Since i live in a culture driven by fostering over adoption its starting to show even more. (Kids want to be part of the family they live with, not sitting on the outside wings of it.) <br>  <br>  The ONLY reason at times a child is put into foster care in Aust first instead of being placed straight away with an adoptive family is because their mother is given time to think about her choices or to rectify her situation so she can parent her child. (That's what happened with my kids) If not then either permanent care or adoption are the other options. A child needs a home, and a sense of security. No one has the right to deny a kid at least that.<br>  <br>  I do believe a mother should be given more time to think about it than they are given in the US. And adoptive families spared the stress and heartache of taking home a child that decisions aren't even finalized for. (How can they not begin to bond and love a child in their home.)<br>  <br>  At least i can say to my kids. "she did have time to think about it and still chose adoption for you before we were even in the picture." It takes doubt out of it. If we were there the whole time then they could become filled with doubt that she chose this and was pressure into it instead. The dynamics are different. I figure my approach and outlook come from growing up in a culture geared towards family preservation. (Face it I was born around the time changes began to happen in Aust. I don't relate well to the 1950's attitude towards single parenting.)<br>  <br>  My children WILL feel wanted and LOVED, cause they have wonderful foster families that loved them so much we all cried the day they left to come home with us. We keep in touch and they are special in their lives. They have so much love around them for all of us!|`|27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	When people talk about Foster Care around here - they talk about adoption FROM foster care.<br>  <br>  You know - the over 100,000 children waiting for a permanent home - ready and available for adoption.<br>  <br>  The kids that really really need it.<br>  <br>  The kids that adoption is supposed to be for.<br>  <br>  What most are against here is infant adoption - which in many cases really doesn't need to happen.<br>  Children do best with the families they are born too.<br>  Being separated from them - is really rather harmful for children - if it really doesn't HAVE to happen.(excepting - of course - cases of abuse)<br>  (read up on child psychology)<br>  <br>  Sadly - infant adoption in the US is a huge business - and it's all about finding babies for infertile peoples - with no consideration about what is really best for the child.<br>  (all children WANT to grow with those that look, act and have talents the same as them - that come from the same gene pool)<br>  No child wants to be given away.<br>  <br>  If adoption doesn't really really have to happen - it shouldn't.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	I've never heard or read anyone say it's better to be in foster care than to have a long-term home.  What I do believe is that adopting from foster care, and giving a family to a child who really needs one, is better than private adoption--which is too often the buying of babies--and the sealed records system.<br>  <br>  A kind of guardianship in which the child's original identity is retained but s/he has a permanent home would be my ideal.<br>  <br>  I was adopted from foster care at the ripe old age of two months.  The state where I was born did things that way:  my mother relinquished, and then I became a ward of the state until my adoption finalized.|`|AA10529334	Well it gives the birth parents time to change their minds and decide to keep the child instead of coming back and taking it once the adoptive parents have fallen in love with the baby.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Foster care is better than being in abusive or neglectful homes.<br>  However, adoption from foster care is the ultimate goal (after the parents have had their chance to straighten up).  No child deserves to stay in foster care, or in a facility, for the rest of their life.<br>  <br>  You can't immediately adopt a child after a problem has been found.  People have to have background checks, physicals, homestudies, etc before they can be considered as adoptive parents.  The bio parents have to be given a certain amount of time (15 months where I live) to try to get their life together and get their child back.<br>  So, best case a child is in foster care for 15 months before being adopted by an approved family.  Worst case.....they age out of the system with no real family to call their own. :(|`|gPg7qYGIaa	it's completed be for u can be adopted your parents must sign a form if they wont then u can't be adopted  that's what makes it hard i'm a full time step mum to my step kids i love to adopted then and start rebuilding there life but there mum wont sign them over even low she starved then hit them and dune so much bad things as she has right i think it stupided<br>  sorry about the spelling i'm dyslexic|`|38yPBwB1aa	If you're giving up your child, foster care isn't better unless you are unsure, but if you are adopting a child, foster care is better.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You don't put children into foster care then adopt them.  You adopt the children who are already there.  Adoption agencies use many shady tactics to persuade people into giving up their infants for adoption.  They don't try to keep families intact, in fact, they work hard to get these babies who might be otherwise able to stay with their families.<br>  <br>  The children in foster care are the ones who need help.  There is always someone willing to take in a healthy newborn.  It takes a special heart to take on an older child who may have issues that would normally give pause to the kind of people who only want infants.  The infant adoption industry (domestic and international) is so corrupt, it should come to an abrupt end.  If someone wants to raise a child, they should be willing to raise an older child, or perhaps a child who has physical or mental limitations.  Or a sibling group.  This demand for healthy infants isn't right.  Not when there are older kids languishing in our foster care system.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	There are several ways that Matching potential parents with pregnant woman can lead to unethical practices and it is widely agreed by many that it's best to adopt babies and children After the parental rights have been terminated or after it is found the parent(s) have had their rights terminated either by choice or after being found unfit.<br>  <br>  It is considered to be Less possible for illegal activities to take place when the adoptive parents have a baby or child placed after the parental rights have been ended. This creates fewer opportunities for the biological parents to be manipulated by emotional or financial means.<br>  <br>  Many adoptive parents would prefer the choice to place a baby be solely that of the parent or only after the parents have been found unfit and no other family member or relative is able or willing to adopt their family member. <br>  <br>  This method keeps out **Some** of the possible unethical and illegal issues that are often connected with the adoption industry. <br>  <br>  As an Adoptive Parent I personally, would not want to be involved with the biological parents at all until it was proven to me the choice was made voluntarily or due to the fact the biological parents were found unable or unfit to parent. The last thing I would want is a baby or child WANTED by able parents who were overwhelmed with a temporary situation which resulted in a permanent decision.<br>  <br>  *|`|3c8GsRvUaa	because foster care you have the child and get to know the kid better and you would first to adopt because they try to make less moving for the child.|`|kprKXEOSaa	I know that in my state, if a mother decides at the last minute to put her child up for adoption, the baby goes temporarily into foster care before being adopted.  This is only because the adoption hasn't been arranged well in advance.  If you're just talking about infants here, an infant isn't going to remember anything about it.<br>  For older children, foster care is used if the parents have "issues" they need to work out.  It's really done to give the parents a second (or third, or fourth) chance.  I agree that it isn't really fair to the kid, it's just for the parents who probably aren't fit in the first place.  On the other hand though, I wouldn't want the state ripping children away from their parents and putting them up for adoption right off, because we all make mistakes and I think that's a dangerous road to go down.  Sometimes the parents just need a wake-up call to get their act together.

Do you know that ovulation do not occur on the same day every month? So instead of guessing when is your ovulation, why dont you purchase opk and monitor your cm when you wiped. When you comes across adundant mucus that is very sticky and stretchy (kind of those like those mucus coming out from your nose, sorry for TMI), you should be in the fertile window. You can re-affirm using opk and it should show positive.. By detecting your O, your hb can have time to regenerate and used sperms only when the time is right. Try to have sex on alternate days and only in the morning..

SWOeg0jFaa	It depends on what kind of a worker and person you are. I leave assignments to for the last minute all the time (apparently I still haven't learned my lesson) and when I tell myself I'll wake up early to do it in the  morning it never works! In the morning I am completely exhausted and delusion and I tell myself that it doesn't matter and fall back asleep. So usually I end up just staying up late and working on it instead, since I am more of a night person than a morning person. It depends on you personally though. Do you think you could manage getting up early and actually committing to it? If you can than that would be the better option but if not do it all tonight. Good luck!

It gets like this to help the sperm on their journey - it's the most sperm friendly type of CM.  The bleeding could just be due to a little trauma to your vagina or cervix, or it could be ovulation spotting (see link below).  So long as your CM was not an unusual colour - everything sounds fine - and promising for BD at the right time.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust.
LALfPKmSaa	She may have trouble sleepimg because she's teething, or something. Cut her naps down during the day. Don't let her nap after 3 pm. And give her a nice warm relaxing bath before bed.

7uVlYPEIaa	I had healthy twin girls at 38 weeks, induced. They are almost 6 months old now. My doctor put me on a drug called breathen (spelling may be off) but it is to put off contractions. It is standard procedure for any multiple pregnancy and they usually give it to you at 28 weeks. My husband knew more about this drug than I did, it was his second set of twins. His ex-wife wouldn't take it (she liked attention and didn't care if they were born severely premature) and they eventually put her on bed-rest in the hospital hooked up to a pump of it. You only have to take it if you are feeling crampy, but my doctor recommended I take it like the prescription said (4 times a day) at around 30 weeks. They will tell you to stop taking it at 35 weeks and let nature take its course from there on out. Just remember to relax, don't lift anything over 30 lbs, just like any other pregnancy. Put your feet up when ever possible. Remember to take both of your vitamins and eat healthy and often. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure and tell you if they think you need to be on bed rest. If your heart starts racing, or your legs start swelling grab a big glass of water and sit with your legs up. Like all pregnancies drink plenty of water. Ask your doctor about the breathen, he should mention it anyway your next appointment. Don't be afraid to call your doctor or the nurses in the office with any questions. That goes with any pregnancy. If you are feeling crampy, if it last longer than a minute or more than four times in an hour call the doctor, he may want you to come in and get checked out or have an NST (neonatal stress test) At the end of the pregnancy you will have atleast one a week anyway, and be sure to bring a book or magazine to read during them. My girls never cooperated with the nurses, they would find one, the other would hide or one would move off the monitor. It took 4 hours one time to do it. Just remember to relax as much as possible and listen to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck. Twins are not as hard as people will have you to believe. Mine are great, well scheduled and sleep through the night and have since they were 3 months old. It took my son, a singleton, till he was 3 to do that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LOL I keep reading all the avoid sex. You don't have to avoid sex. I had sex up to 6 months pregnant and would of after that if I could of found a way of doing it. Eventually all positions are uncomfortable. If you are on your back you can't breath from the babies being up in your lungs, your sides will kill you from them sitting on nerves, and on top then he can't breath LOL.  Plain and simple if it hurts don't do it.  Don't do something you are not use to doing, like lifting on something, jogging or standing on your feet for prolonged periods of time.I worked to 32 weeks in a factory lifting a 30 lb boxes every 5 minutes standing for 12 hours.|`|tYk1G8Qlaa	Hey sweetie, Don't do too much, Rest as much s you can and just do the little things. People say to stop having sex which is crap but i was told that a lot of can help bring labor on after about 35 weeks or so. ( My sister had a lot of sex with all her pregnancies and she brought her labour on) A lot of walking, Walking is good for you while your pregnant but don't over do it. Don't lift anything over 20  to30 lbs, Put your feet up whenever possible and take nice relaxing bubble baths. Stay stress free and worry free but go see your doctor/midwife and they will tell you all the do's and don't's.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  <br>  Hugs.|`|cGEgRvcvaa	I am now a couple days over 35 weeks with my twins. The only thing I really avoided was any lifting, anything over a grocery bag weight. I have not avoided sex at all. Currently I am , only because the weight and pressure of the babies are making it uncomfortable. I had an u/s at 33 1/2 weeks and both were weighing in at 4 lbs. I am not dilating, though Braxton Hicks are getting alot worse. I go in today to schedule my c-section for 37 weeks. Hopefully I will make it another week or two. I think that if you just try to sit with your feet up, rest as much as possible, and avoid strenous activity, you'll be ok. In the end I think it just depends on each individual's body.|`|yNoENquTaa	anything that strains your body i suppose. and avoid sex too. but you should ask your doc for a more educated opinion. take it easy. =]<br>  ???|`|MXVrsn1Oaa	Hi. I was diagnosed with a short cervix at 34 weeks. To make my pregnancy last longer i was advised to take it easy and not do anything strenuous at all. especially the hoovering. If u have to do housework, do the simple stuff. Nothing heavy, and probably avoiding sex. But the best person to really ask is your midwife. Only a midwife with your notes in front of her can be the best person for advice. they're the experts. Good luck with twins!!!|`|b2b8155bcf954df30218bc6e6b5c7415aa	Lay off the buttt sex for a while and you should be okay.|`|1CryEnb3aa	First of all, congrats.  I would say try refraining from anything strenuous.  Rest often and eat healthy.  Just don't over do it.  Good luck|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Hire a maid! No but seriously nothing strenuous, no lifting groceries your other children and definitely no sex (contains prostaglandins that help soften and open your cervix). Have your SO help you with everything he/she can.
n2O0NwR6aa	Yep, I'd let my daughter go.  My kids don't have a set curfew - it's flexible, depending on the situation.  I tell them what time to be home based on what they're doing and what time the event ends.  But even if they did have a regular curfew, I'd be okay with making an exception every once in a while.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes. I don't think that curfews should be inflexible. My oldest son did not have one. We knew where he was, who he was with and around when he was coming home. We never caught him doing things that he was not suppose to do so we stuck with that.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It would depend if my kid was responsible or not.|`|AA10943329	they are 17, they don't need a curfew on a friday|`|jD8TxlLfaa	Yeah, of course. I never had a set curfew. Ever. When I was little, I had to be inside when the street lights came on and I always had to be within calling distance (meaning that if I my caregiver went outside and yelled my name, I had to be able to hear it). However, that was when I was about 7 or 8 (and also when it was safer for kids to play outside, in a small town where everyone knew everyone). Not 17. Once I got older, I never had a set curfew. The only rules were I had to let my caregiver know where I was going and roughly when I would be back. If I was going to be later than I said, I had to call. I think that's perfectly reasonable.|`|AA11735666	Yes, of course in that situation I would.  My reason, because it's good that she's going with friends, and it's great that she is going to the movies in stead of some things that a lot of 17 year olds do on a Friday night.  I would be fair to her since she is being fair with you, yanno?  I don't think a half an hour is too bad.  But that's just me.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	We don't have a set curfew for our teens.  we know what they are doing and where they are and we base their time to be home on what that particular thing is and because they are so well behaved, respectful AND respected by everyone, I would definately let them.|`|5ZvALiclaa	sorry i'm not an overprotective psycho mum either.lol...under the circumstances, being 17 and seeing as its a friday night and not a school night and providing s/he is home by 11.30 i don't see anything wrong with it.|`|OxFV92hJaa	I'd allow that.

If your mom is over protective, just understand why....<br>  <br>  even if a kid is responsible, the unthinkable could always happen, and it happens more often.

I think it is very important to let your kids bend the rules every once in a while, but you need to let them know that it is a one time deal. I would make her call you on her after the movie is over. Lets face it. 11:30 really isn't that late. When i was 17 i received a call from a friend on a Tuesday night and she was going through an extremely hard time. The call was at 1am. I asked my mom if i could go to her house and help her out and my mother agreed. I was at my friends house until 3:30. I really appreciated that my mother allowed me to go. I'm sure that anyone would be appreciated if you let them bend the rules every once in a while. I hope this helped.|`|SimAO1IUaa	of course i would. big deal! i hate phsyco parents that are super strict. like my friend i know has parents that are just really strict and think their daughter is a complete angel, but thats an act and shes the total opposite. so i think when parents act like really strict, if the child is smart they will put on an act and just act how they think their parents want them to act.strict parents dont develop good relationships with their chidlren|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	Well yeah, obviously. I mean it's only 11pm. I just turned 16 and I'm allowed to stay out until 5am if I want. Can't remember ever having a curfew, why would a 17 year old need to be home by 11?|`|5dMw30kMaa	Dude its a movie and they're 17. No biggie screw the curfew. hahaha.

m9eSPvdfaa	My baby is almost 3mo old. I don't breast feed and didn't even try but my breasts are still leaking. I think it's normal for you to still be producing milk but not to be in so much pain! (unless your pain tolerance is very low) be sure you wear a tight fitting supportive bra and maybe try cold compresses and ibuprofen. If you are seriously miserable and experiencing pain that you feel is abnormal, don't second guess your instincts and call your doc!

Cx5Zo7IIaa	To clean him use cotton balls and baking soda water or you can soak him in a bath of it. Try desitin, it has 40% zinc oxide in it which help sooth and heal skin. If absolutely nothing else works, try this, it works every time on my little girl, it will even get rid of thrush. <a href="http://motherlove.com/product_diaper_rash_relief.php" rel="nofollow">http://motherlove.com/product_diaper_ras...</a>|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I'd go to the doctor and get a cream prescribed if he's bleeding.  For the moment stop using wipes, use just plain water and cotton wool and try and leave his bum out to air a few times a day.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	Metanium - you get it at the chemist.  Its a thick yellow medicated barrier cream which is a nightmare to get off but really works.<br>  <br>  I also found letting the air get to a nappy rashed bottom helped to heal it quicker.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|LbkLg4RFaa	It's possible that the rash is from teething.  What you can do is just use cotton balls and warm water to clean his bum.  Pat the area instead of wiping.  And if applying any cream pat it gently onto the affected areas instead of wiping or rubbing.  Also try leaving his nappy off as long as possible to let the area air out.  If you want to make a trip to the doctor you could also see if they would prescribe hydrocortizone cream.|`|145RUNQHaa	One suggestion.dilute his fruit juice if he has it especially acidic fruit juice like orange.dilute it well.drinking neat orange juice makes urine very strong which will sting his bottom like hell.bepanthen is the best cream.x|`|hE7fK4W0aa	Kerry K & away with the faries is spot o n Metanium is a god send for babies sore bum :)|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Use Aqueous cream BP, get it from your chemist, also, try using cotton wool and warm water to wipe his bum with and try and leave him without a nappy any time you can to get air into him, it's common for them to get nappy rash when teething, my youngest daughter also gets in when she is coming down with a bug or the cold xxx|`|LQnKhiVMaa	take his nappy off, and let him get some fresh air, for an hr or 2 every day.. try bepanthon, or zinc and castor oil is harmless, sudacrem is good but can be a little strong... avoid wipes (my daughter is allergic to them anyways, in the anti alergenic ones), and as people have already said, stick to cotton wool, and water, or i use soft kleenex tissues that u normally use on your nose x xgood luck... the fresh air really helped my daughter who had terrible problems while teething with her molars x x good luck|`|AA12279950	For god's sake don't put him in a salt bath!

Use cut-up J Cloths and water to wash - cleans beautifully!  <br>  <br>  I found Bepanthen works much better than Sudocream - give it a try it is a much better and less drying barrier cream.|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	Dont be stressed. You've come to a place where your sons problem will be solved within the next day.<br>  <br>  I agree with most of the ladies, switch to cotton wool and <br>  "cool boiled" water (if it's bleeding as described)<br>  <br>  Air babies bottom - let him crawl around WITHOUT a nappy if possible allowing his bottom to air<br>  <br>  Use a hydrocortisone cream with added anti fungal properties (ask your pharmacist /chemist/drug store) for an over the counter one. Only use it for a week NO MORE. Then move onto the other ones mentioned above Metunium or something like that....<br>  <br>  Finally if this continues beyond a week, look at the foods he is eating (not teeth) - you MAY need to eliminate some known allergens from his diet (this all depends on his age)<br>  <br>  Known allergens are nuts, diary, wheat, gluten - you may need some support from a paed dietrician if he's over 1 year otherwise the formula/breastmilk will cover any lack in nutrients you may remove in an elimination diet (only if under 1 year of age). If the problem goes away, reintroduce sensitive wipes at first and then back to your standard wipes....do all this very slowly over weeks not days.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck - be proud of yourself for seeking support.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	when babies teeth they produce a lot more saliva. <br>  young babies can push the saliva out and drool everywhere, upright babies tend to swallow it. Swallowed saliva can burn on the way out, so nappy rashes are common at this time.<br>  <br>  try leaving him without a nappy on for as long as you can. give lots of indirect sunlight time and fresh air. Outside under a tree would be ideal! <br>  <br>  keep that area as dry as possible. <br>  if you want to apply a cream (Sudercrem is fine) make sure you dab the area very dry first. if you apply cream to moist skin - the moisture gets trapped there making more nappy rash to deal with.<br>  <br>  if the rash blisters up over the next couple of days his skin may have developed an infection, so a trip to the doctor will get him antibiotic or antifungal cream to clear it up.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Hi,  <br>  My daughter is going through the same thing this weekend.  I use Metanium cream, it's a thick yellow cream and can be messy but it's brilliant stuff.  Sudacrem isn't very good in my opinion.<br>  While the nappy rash is red and sore <br>  1.  use cotton wool balls and warm water to clean him.  Even the most gentle baby wipes can irritate your baby.<br>  2. leave the nappy off for as long as you can to let the air get to the baby's bottom to speed up the healing process<br>  <br>  The mixture of urine and faeces produces ammonia (high pH) and this increases faecal enzyme activity which makes the skin more susceptible to damage. Also, whilst urine alone does not usually irritate the skin, if the skin becomes very wet it is more susceptible to irritants. A wet nappy can also rub against the skin and cause soreness<br>  <br>  Here's a link to my answers on the same subject<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApYG6VnFdYQVnkm184uS_zYgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222092743AARpa0f">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|10b2b615c8f0ca19d750e607674a3c6daa	What you need is: Air to the bum, no wipes (cotton/wash cloth/or similar and water), Bordeaux's Butt Paste, and some baby powder. I clean up my son, slather (literally) his bottom with but cream and then cover it in baby powder. The 1-2 times he's had a rash cleared up in 2-3 days. I now do that every night before bed and he hasn't had an episode in 2-3 months.<br>  <br>  FYI Bordeaux's has a lot higher concentration of zinc oxide that does say desitin. and zinc oxide is what keeps moisture off the bottom.|`|WbU9imdHaa	hi i found using fragrance free wipes and Bepanthen worked well when my 4 week old baby had a really sore bum which at times was so bad she was bleeding.

That sounds awful! But I read your other question about ovulation. You just might be ovulating later. Maybe you should take a break from trying in March. You and your hubby should try and BD every other day in March. That way you're not stressed over the fertile time, and you guys can enjoy each other.<br>  I feel a lot better now that I'm not testing with OPK's and Preg tests all of the time. And it seems to go faster. My period is due around Friday,I can't believe it! I think everything went smoother when I wasn't monitoring. It will happen for us! :)|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	Awww hun, *big hugs* I am with you in spirit :) Keep trying, remember you will be ovulating soon!! Get BD  and don't give up!

VJs1jZJ1aa	Im 33 weeks and ive been getting a sharp stabbing pain down there too. It was coming every 15 minutes and lasting for about a minute or two. I was shopping so i had been walking around a lot. This was 2 days ago and it went away so im guessing it was braxton hicks. My doctor suggested drinking a glass of water and lying down when that starts happening. She said that real contractions would get closer together and stronger, and that braxton hicks would be irregular and  usually stop after you get off your feet.|`|EFc8VGwRaa	sounds like braxton hicks as they usually start to happen at this time...but if your still woprried call your doctor or midwife and im sure they would be able to help you|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Real labour pains normally increase in severity, and begin to come closer together.<br>  <br>  I would guess that you're probably just getting some braxton hicks contractions. Like 'practice' contractions. Your stomach will go hard for a few seconds, and it sometimes hurts like period pains. They're nothing to worry about though.<br>  <br>  If you find that your pains get stronger or more frequent, I would call the doctor and get it checked out.|`|OiFNZnwOaa	it is nt labour so dont stress, it is your body preparing for the real thing in the future, its called braxton hicks the tightening in your belly and the pain in your vagina could be the baby moving it happened to me alot and also back pain is completely normal in the latter stages...<br>  if the pains get worse and regular and start coming closer together then its real labour..|`|tn3CCytmaa	Well<br>  <br>  sounds dangerous somewhat  . you can go and have a regular checkup for physician <br>  <br>  as it sounds that your are in pain . that you shouldn't be .

7PXFXcKfaa	noooooooooo thats an old wives tale!<br>  <br>  I cut my first tooth when i was 3 and a half months old, and now im in my mid twenties and have absolutely no cavities or any problems with my teeth. So im proof that its wrong!<br>  <br>  All babies are born with teeth buds, its just a matter of every baby cutting theirs at different times! Dont worry about it! <br>  <br>  What IS true though, is that its more difficult to clean a 4 month olds teeth... well ... tooth i guess! Therefore children who cut their teeth earlier often do get more cavities ... So ensure you insist on good dental hygiene from the beginning! <br>  <br>  Dont worry - your child is fine! :o)|`|AA10529334	I think that saying came into being back when the average child still used a bottle at age 2. Now doctors tell us to get the children off bottles by age 1 in order to protect their teeth.  <br>  <br>  Dont let them drink milk in bed at night. The sugars from the milk stay on the teeth and constant sucking on a bottle can malform the teeth.|`|UY3j47ozaa	not necessarily my son got his first tooth at 9 months and now i have to bring him to the dentist to have them pulled out because they take so long to fall out they interfere with the new teeth coming in...my younger son got his 1 st tooth at 4 months and his new teeth came in beautiful...|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well alot of people do say that the longer they take the stronger they will be. my daughter has just got her first at 14 months so well see...personally i dont agree i think the better the dental hygeine the stronger they will be|`|Iu0AJDviaa	Sorry i have never heard of that.<br>  And it doesnt work in our place<br>  ( i have 7 kids and my youngest in teething)|`|no4tGa45aa	Not at all - its all about what you eat and how often you brush! My teeth came in really late (about 16mths) and i have had SO many trips to the dentist for fillings, getting teeth pulled (because some baby teeth would stay in when the adult teeth had come through) oh god im so lucky my parents can afford the dentist!

JQZDCcyQaa	He is probably getting frustrated because he has become used to having a bottle which gives him the milk straight away, where as he has to work to get the milk from you. You dont need to supplement at all if you just continue to feed him from the breast he will get enough, trust me boobs know what they are doing, you will have enough milk. What you have to do is pump a little bit so that you stimulate your letdown then put him on while it starts to spray that way he will get it straight away, then just continue to feed from the breast and then do away with the bottles, try to pump in between to build up your supply because it will have dropped because of the bottles|`|7PXFXcKfaa	Your doing great ...  <br>  <br>  more people supplement with the occasional 1 bottle than organisations like LLL will ever let you know!! My LO needs a top up sometimes too...<br>  <br>  to be honest if hes spitting up its because hes full! its like overflow, so dont worry about him being hungry. he probably doesnt want to eat - just suckle for comfort. remember breastfeeding is ALOT more than just food.<br>  <br>  this too will pass. Have patience, and confidence in your self and your body ... your doing great!|`|IDmaxViIaa	ummmmmmmm|`|IGcS9K62aa	The biggest thing you need to do is ensure that your son is getting exactly what he needs to eat. I recommend pumping in the meantime to get/keep your supply up. Pump after each feeding especially to help increase supply. Also if he is getting frustrated feed for less time on each breast and switch more often. So feed for 5 min on one side, burp, switch to other breast feed for 5 more, burp and continue to switch back and forth. <br>  <br>  I had a ton of trouble breastfeeding my daughter I was never able to do it exclusively. But I was able to be quite successful given my situation. I never could produce enough and my daughter wasn't getting enough to eat so I supplemented. You just need to remember that your baby nourishment comes first!<br>  <br>  Check out the La Leche League website. I found them really helpful!|`|EFc8VGwRaa	he may be addicted to the formula as a lot of babies who have both can sometimes refuse one which is usually the breast..<br>  another reason maybe that he has alot of wind try burping him.<br>  and usually when they have a growth spurt they eat alot...i mean it almost feels like you never put your breast away..if he is doing the same thing in a day i would take him to the docotor it could be something much worse

ZSBZ83Dpaa	Strangely, parents always think that their upbringing was more strict than the way kids are being treated "nowadays". There may be some truth in that since we do get less conservative and restrictive, at least in Europe. Many young parents see children as a valuable gift and try to cherish what they have. They are also averse to conflict and try to accommodate their kids' wishes and sometimes whims. I don't think that this is doing kids much good. For them to grow up to be responsible adults, it is important tat they learn early to accept rules and to accept consequences when they have broken the rules. This is what I try to teach my girls, and yes, they do end up over my knee when that is necessary to discipline them. I know I'm a dinosaur, but I believe that some tough love will benefit my girls eventually.|`|d2yhgGU6aa	Most of my friends get disciplined, although some are spoiled with items.<br>  <br>  the thing that blows my mind is grades. There are people i know who do no school work whatsoever and get terrible grades, and they still have full privileges, so I'm assuming their parents are fine with that. Whenever I don't turn in assignment or get a C or lower on something my mom rides my ***. granted, I'm pretty intelligent but still, these kids don't even try.|`|pB1oXLz5aa	yeah, I'm 29 and my folks used to flat out whoop my ***. they didn't even need an excuse, just keep me in check. I'm not that bad with my kids but if they do something that they are not supposed to do and that thing could possibly inflict physical harm to them then you better believe I spank them. the problem is most people don't know how to spank so people either beat their kids or spoil the **** out of them..... it's pretty simple. never spank when your angry and always explain why your spanking and that you love them. it's not rocket surgery.|`|A6iJGksUaa	I totally agree !<br>  <br>  In my younger years I was spanked and yelled at for small acts such as "spilling my orange juice everywhere and not cleaning it up" or stomping out of a store when my mom wouldnt get me something.<br>  <br>  Now i see in malls this one girl stomped her way out of a store cussing her mom out and crying and all her mom said was "I understand your frustration but please understand that I can not afford this right now"<br>  <br>  Parents are soo soft now. My mom would have dragged me to the bathroom and whipped my but !|`|XzXpDPpfaa	Thank you for opening your eyes! I'm 19 and I must say that kids these days are getting WAY out of hand.<br>  <br>  I partly blame the 'no smacking your children' law.<br>  Parents are scared to smack their children in fear of persecution and prosecution.<br>  <br>  But I'm telling you now, when I have children, if they misbehave, they WILL get smacked.|`|EZZPXmmOaa	I am with you completely and I am trying to combat it by watching Super Nanny and Wife Swap to see the psychology of a family and if I will be able to properly raise one.|`|38VeNgjtaa	Good point. I was physically disaplined when I was younger and it was the best thing for me. Im 22 and now days parents dont know how to disapline their children. A bunch of yupees.|`|MDTj4U75aa	It is because people are becoming more and more liberal and are choosing to discipline their children less and less (due to the fact that they don't really care for them).|`|HKtxjWV1aa	I agree...although no one told MY parents!|`|FNv1cCAPaa	I think the child doesn't like being bugged so he/she is softer to his/her child and so on. etc. etc. etc.|`|9Ht6M77Raa	i agree strongly!  I worked with children for several years and there's different emotions behind each parents thinking of proper parenting. Some are afraid of certain types of discipline being considered abuse. Some have the attitude that they don't want to be hard on their child if they had a rough upbringing, some spend so much time away from their children they try to cater to the child to make up for not spending time with them.  To me, these are the worse types they cant spend 10 minutes reading to their child before bed, but can buy them yet another $50.00 video game to keep them distracted. You also have the broken home epidemic, daddy doesn't want to punish his child if he only see's him on weekends therefore allowing the worst behavior. This is what i wish some parents would take time to realize You the Parent are the biggest influence on your child. Take time to realize that what you do and say matters, good or bad.  Sometimes discipline is needed because it promotes character.  They will respect you eventually and understand.      There is a lot of bad things happening in this world with children, things starting younger and younger we do need some real parenting!.|`|gTfIQaHcaa	I think that this is related to how the parents of this generation  of children were brought up themselves. I remember one of the most effective forms of punishment from my parents was making their disappointment in me very clear. It was horrible! They never spanked either myself or my brother, though, well, they never really needed to. I think that today's children are not being given the information and rules that they need in order to mature effectively and properly, and so we end up with a wilder generation. It's not that the parents (at least, this is what I think - I'm 21) are being soft, but that they were not taught any better by THEIR parents, so they simply apply the same rules to their children, and you can see where this is going.<br>  This doesn't seem as apparent in Australia (where I live) but it is definitely still present. I am determined, in the face of all that, to make sure that my child not only grows up being aware of the appropriate boundaries, but also that they have to take responsibility for their own actions and thoughts rather than placing the blame on others. I believe that it's also important to make sure that your child knows that the choices that are there to make are their choices after a certain point. We're there to guide them through their young lives and help them to make the correct decisions, not to make them for them!<br>  <br>  Hope this clarified some things for you!<br>  :)|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	Just because whatever "soft parenting" you heard about on TV doesn't work now doesn't mean reverting back to hitting children is the answer. That's a pretty knee-jerk reaction. <br>  <br>  I realize you didn't say hitting in your question, but I saw it in a few answers. That aside, I still have to disagree with you - I was rarely, if ever disciplined - I didn't do anything requiring discipline. My parents had my respect because they DESERVED it. They DID NOT get my respect simply because they were parents, so when I did something they disapproved of, their disapproval was not some sort of acknowledgment of my "coolness" - it hurt. A lot of unintelligent people decide (or accidentally) to become parents - that's where your brats come from. Discipline is hollow authority used by someone who can't live up to their own standards.<br>  <br>  There is no reason someone should respect a parent if the parent is a worthless, ignorant role model. Respect is earned, not obligated by birth.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who snuck out of the house a lot, partied, etc blah blah, stereotypical deviant. Her mother disciplined her, grounded her, etc etc - no avail. Her mother was also an unintelligent, unquestioning and revoltingly NEEDY individual. <br>  <br>  Also you're stuck in your own cultural mode of thought - there are other cultures who don't rely on authoritarian means of raising a child, they probably don't need it, because they don't have the materialism and vicious, unfriendly competitive nature of the west.<br>  <br>  So, to be blunt - my view: if you want you're kid to respect you, be someone worth respecting.<br>  <br>  Alas..I bid thee farewell 10 points..|`|dA9Tcp8Qaa	?¤·? Parents are definitely going soft...actually, they are more lazy then soft. My mom was always hard on me, and made sure I knew when I did something wrong. <br>  <br>  For me, my mom would talk to me first, and then if I did it again, I'd be yelled at and sent to my bedroom. I wouldn't be allowed out until we both calmed down. It never got to the point I couldn't go anywhere as a punishment. But, I would have to earn the trust to be able to go out. My step dad on the other hand didn't care, and would brush it off. He make fun of the way his ex-wife would discipline, but when it came down to it, he was exactly the same way. Parents are getting to lazy to do anything. ?¤·?|`|01Mu3wUeaa	The thing is, some parents are loose and some are not.It is like this now and it was like this way back when.<br>  <br>  I for one am not that kind of parent and wouldn't think twice about grounding my kid (well, when he is old enough to do something wrong lol)|`|Z03zgM0maa	"White parents should beat their kids" - Comedian Russell Peters<br>  <br>  Parents nowadays are very leniant with their kid. They don't want to seem to strict so they let the kids do what ever they want. This becomes a habit. I think kids are very spoiled and parents have no control over it because they allow it to happen. Then they complain when the kids don't listen to them later on. That is their fault for spoiling them. With this trend, I find that there are more ungrateful people, picky eaters, and spoiled brats.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes I see it everyday. My kids have friends like this. They aren't allowed to come over unless they act like kids instead of wild beasts. My kids know what discipline is and how to act.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Uh-huh..this question has been debated in this section at least 500 times. No need to get into it again.

I was just a good kid. I love and respect my parents greatly today. I can tell now how wonderful they were compared to others parents. <br>  <br>  Yes I have noticed this trend. Parents are starting to believe its the kids fault instead of theirs. They don't take responsibility for how the child is growing and behaving because they don't think it's their fault. I disagree. I think however a child grows up is directly reflected on how they were raised. If your child behaves badly and is mean, that's because you raised them that way. I think parents need a news flash on who really influences children because until your a teenager, your family is your #1 influence.|`|zRc4Swewaa	The society changes and parents are soft with their kids nowadays.They don't spank them anymore.I live here in Japan and I have three boys but i discipline them and ground them when it's needed.I grew up in the Philippines and I have strict parents.My parents disciplined us and I'm also grateful for what they have done for us.The cause of spoiled brats are some parents working for full time and to show their love is to buy what their kids want.They show their love thru material things,to patch up for the lost hours that they must share with their children.But I think lack of love and communication is also one the cause.They don't discipline them because they neglect them and some parents lack patience with their children that make them lazy to discipline them.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	um... those "kids that run the house" types always existed, you just didn't know them I guess.

Not since the Vikings, not kidding.|`|OxFV92hJaa	I agree, and I firmly believe it is a result of 2 things:<br>  1)Laziness<br>  2)Former abuse to the now parents that are attempting to "break the cycle"...but failing to associate appropriate discipline. <br>  <br>  It's a VERY controversial issue. But those are my thoughts on it. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, not many parents give birth and intend to screw up....live and learn.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Definitely. <br>  I've also seen young parents swearing in front of and also at their young children in public!<br>  Bad parenting.. and then they send their kids to psychologists and moan about their bad habits and manners and eventually the family breaks down.. absolutely terrible.|`|3lV7ZY3raa	i notice, that the parents who are like that, usually had horrific childhoods, ie, they were badly beaten by there parents regularly for something as stupid as dropping a cup.|`|rM8WrUFNaa	quite obviously parents are gettin soft we got 13 year old little girls running around this topic room that are pregnant!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Yes, but it started even before you were born.  I started seeing it with the families I babysat for when I was your age and younger and Im now in my early 40's.  There is a total lack of respect being taught by parents.  They aren't teaching thier children to respect them, themselves or others and the children are being let to do whatever they want.  It started with people taking parenting classes and reading books that told them they were scarring their childrens little delicate phsycies and that they should never say no or don't  do tthat to their children.  They were told to distract them from bad behaviour...which didn't teach the children they even were doing bad behavior and they learned that that behavior always got them attention.  The parents were told that spanking was abuse and that children always needed multitudes of choices and they should be able to decide when and what they should be aloud to do because why should the children have to endure things we as adults would not want to endure, but they forgot that children are learning and parents are supposed to know better and teach tier children how to behave and to have respect and how to control thier behavior, they forgot it was thier responsability to keep thier children safe and they forgot they needed to be able to command their childrens behavior in order to do that.  They basically forgot who the parents were.

Best of luck!|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Join my club!!<br>  <br>  Although I don't work.<br>  <br>  I cant stand food smells, cant even go to Asda.<br>  <br>  Constantly tired and lethargic.<br>  <br>  Should pass after 12 weeks.|`|xubIaiZaaa	yeah its normal, most of your drinking and food adversion is from morning sickness, concentration too, as you arent eating much and feeling so sick.<br>  <br>  Try diluted fruit juice to drink, and eating banana's and other fruit, dry toast and other bland foods for morning sickness. Some people find dry ginger ale helps, or sea bands for sea/travel sickness|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	Some say that a troublesome pregnancy leads to an easy labour! However, try the travel sickness acupressure bracelet available from chemists...that helps with the sick feeling. Tiredness is natural..but rest assured, around 12-15 weeks you enter the middle section...this is usually the easiest and best! Not long now!|`|XHHkBkwOaa	for the first three months i was a mess <br>  <br>  vomiting every time of the day including waking up during the night to throw up and most of the time i would thro up my vil because i wasnt able to eat ANYTHING~~~~~~~~~~~~`<br>  <br>  <br>  i had to be hospitalized and had to drip bags worst ever because they were so cold and my arm was like frozon for a few hours it was horrible!!<br>  <br>  afterwards though i was great and could even jump on the trmpoline and ride my horses again all the way up to 35 wks :D<br>  <br>  i hope it doesnt last long for you i feel your sympathy!|`|no4tGa45aa	When i was pregnant i could have written your post word for word! I couldnt stomach anything (even water and at one point i was nearly hospitalized due to dehydration (i did drink water but i kept throwing it up)) I used those motion sickness bands like pp suggested and they worked a little bit (didnt make me feel 100% but better than i did!) The sickness should ease at around 3mths :)|`|kokmVBuPaa	<a href="http://4fun.eniac.at" rel="nofollow">http://4fun.eniac.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|AA12395149	Ah hormones and the fun things they cause while you're pregnant.  I had many a food aversion, and they were foods that I have always loved!  For the nausea, you can try sea bands (acupressure bracelets), saltine crackers, Ginger ale and/or tea, and what really worked well for me were B-natal lozenges.  B-natal lozenges or B vitamin supplement that comes in the form of sour apple flavored lozenges (my preference) and cherry lolly pops.  They usually zap the nausea right away and keep it at bay for a few hours.<br>  <br>  As for food aversions, you just have to find what you like and go with that (unless it's something that isn't recommended).  If you only like it for a few minutes, eat what you can, then get it out of your site.  <br>  <br>  Instead of gulping down water, try sipping it over the hours.  Try not to drink too much before and during meals, this will stretch out your stomach and make you feel even more miserable.<br>  <br>  Just try to get plenty of rest and when you can, take a quick snooze for five or ten minutes.  A bit of exercise in the morning can also do wonders for all of these symptoms through out the day.  I know it can be very hard to drag yourself out of bed when you feel so horrible, but a 15-30 minute walk and/or some stretching in the morning will really help.  If you can do it again later in the day, all the better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats with the pregnancy.|`|dTNMICyTaa	I found drinking water really hard too, so I was drinking what I craved, which was Mango smoothies!<br>  Frozen Mango pieces with yogurt & lots of ice! Blend it & drink!<br>  It satisfied my thirst & gave me much needed calcium!<br>  You can add any sort of fruit but make sure it's frozen.<br>  <br>  I also suffered from a kind of nausea. You know when you are SO hungry you feel sick? Well That's what I had. I had to eat through that feeling. I found I felt fine for 15 mins after eating, then I felt sick again. Only thing that helped me was to eat & eat & eat.  Nothing fattening but lots of fruit, salad & some bread.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy. We are all different but it sounds like a normal start to me!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Kerry. (due in 17 days)|`|g9vw4ovGaa	All that sounds 100% normal to me. If I even looked at my hubby, I would feel SO sick that he would have to leave the room. I couldn't bare the smell of him. I only got sick maybe once in my entire pregnancy, and I felt so sick all day long. I stayed on plain rice, toast, broth, & things of that nature. Also Ginger Ale is wonderful for nausea, the ginger helps keep it at bay. I know this is a huge no no, but it worked for me, when i felt queasy, i would drink a half of a glass of coke, something about it just made me feel better. Also, don't get out of bed without eating something, some crackers, anything, because if you start your day hungry/nauseous, the rest of the day will follow suit. In pregnancy, i didn't feel hungry, i just got sick, so I would munch all day long, so I never got hungry and never felt sick. Oh also, I agree with susie, My pregnancy was the worst, broke my tail bone, horrible back pain, the works. I was only in labor for 6 hours and she was in the world!|`|hYZIYla0aa	You are suffering bad morning sickness,Please talk to your doctor about promethazine.It really does help.Morning sickness lasts 3-4 months,some of us suffer more than others,unfortunately you have the worst case,it is all hormones going crazy in your body,Are you pregnant with twins?I am asking because I was pregnant my 3rd time And I could barely get out of bed,I was pregnant with twins and it was the worst morning sickness I ever had.if you are pregnant with twins,you are also a high risk pregnancy and you should be able to leave work months earlier than if you were pregnant with 1 child.I know it is hard to eat and drink at this point,but try to force yourself.Even if you take a few sips of water and a few bites of food it is better for you and the baby or babies.A little each hour is better than nothing.Also remember the vitamins will make you sick too,until your body gets used to them.|`|oCTG5IVvaa	aw i know how you feel! it all kicked in for me at 8 weeks, i was exactly the same - not being sick but feeling really really sick, which is still awful.<br>  I also went off my food, my appetite still hasn't returned yet.<br>  <br>  My mum advised eating ice lollies or ice pops - which means you're getting water, but its nice and cold which kind of helped me, i don't know why.<br>  So i got those pyramid shaped lollies.<br>  Also, she said to eat what ever it is you feel you can handle, "forget" trying to eat healthy etc, it's better to eat something than nothing at all...for example, the only things i could handle was crumpets and cranberry juice with ice cubes..and ice lollies obviously.<br>  Now i am really branching out and i like mashed potato and peas lol!<br>  <br>  My boyfriend is a real saint and cooks whatever i want for me, because i find smells make me feel ill and it's much easier that way.<br>  <br>  Keep taking you vitamins they are really good and make sure you are getting what you need. <br>  <br>  Also, as soon as you feel you could handle some food, eat straight away, don't hang about because that moment could be gone in a matter of minutes.<br>  The sickness does get slowly better for most ladies, i started getting better at 13 weeks although i still have my moments.<br>  <br>  As for feeling tired - it's awful..i feel like a zombie at work, i'm on my feet all day and its torture.<br>  All i can reccomend is going to bed as soon as you need to when you get home, i go to bed as early as 8 some nights.<br>  It's a real treat!<br>  I took a weeks holiday at 10 weeks and it helped for while.<br>  <br>  Just be selfish, if you are tired, zombie-like, and fussy with food - this is the one time in life where everyone will be happy to help and cut you some slack, use your partner/friends/family!<br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope you feel better soon! x
s1BaLV1Laa	You should get an a accurate test result if you test 1st thing tomorrow morning. But just to be sure wait a couple more days.|`|AA12123428	Take yourself to a clinic tomorrow. They'll test you for free. Find one at <a href="http://www.fpa.org.uk/finder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpa.org.uk/finder/</a>|`|5ZvALiclaa	I waited between 5-7 days after my period was due to test with my pregnancies. All 3 came up positive straight away, plus after a week with no period I was pretty sure i was pregnant, lol! It was hard waiting but worth it. Try and at least wait another 3 days and then test again|`|claUGpVRaa	Leave it a few days yet. If you do happen to be pregnant, you probably don't have enough of the pregnancy hormones in your system yet to give a positive result. <br>  Try again if you haven't come on in about 4 days time.|`|yQVcIfa8aa	wait a couple more days, then do a HPT first thing in the morning with first urine, good luck.|`|fWAzJIEkaa	=(<br>  It might still b too early, as ur HCG levels may be too low!<br>  Wait another week,and if period still hasnt shown, do the test!<br>  Let me know how u get on! Got my fingers crossed for U! xx|`|oCTG5IVvaa	hi, just wanted to tell you...<br>  i took a first response test (which can tell you you're pregnant 6 days before your periods due) 5 days before period was due and it came up negative.<br>  BUT i was convinced, and did a test the evening before period due and it came up positive instantly!! <br>  One of the happiest days of my life so far (scan, hearing heartbeat and meeting my boyfriend up there with it!)<br>  So, i think you should do a test tomorrow morning, morning always best.<br>  Good luck!!! x x|`|LQnKhiVMaa	i would say 5 days, if it hasnt shown its face or, if u go to wilkinsons, or pound shop, u can get cheaper hpt's. when i was trying.. i would get aload of the cheaper ones in , test everyday upto a week after my period, normally the period would come and that would be the end of it... but the last time , i went the 5 days with 2 bfp and 3 bfn, and then bought a clear blue digital, conception one, and yay it was bfp. they come in packs of 5 from the wilkinsons near me and only cost ￡6... rather than buying half a dozen ￡12 ones lol x x<br>  <br>   i have to admit, i was alittle obsessed, with wanting a bfp at the time lol x|`|b6EyFLgUaa	It took me 6 weeks to get a positive result. I KNEW i was pregnant. I read that if you were on the nova ring ( like i was) it changes the hormones and what not and it takes longer.|`|drDpM6opaa	hi i didn't get a positive until i was 2 weeks late on my period i would wait about that if i was you because you arnt actually late are you you could come on later today but good luck|`|oLz4jYXqaa	You can get HPT kits from One Pound shops. So cheep, cheep, cheep. You can do one everyday.|`|nETw4eOKaa	wait about a week or 2
JAdNkzENaa	if i was in that situation - which i am not - but if i was i would NOT let him have sex with her although i know a lesbian couple that were trying to get pregnant and the "donor" (who was married) just ejaculated into a cup in the room next door and they used a turkey baster and inserted into the female. it worked. she had two babies and they are 3 now. i swear|`|AA11795652	Never!|`|wxImZRssaa	No. I think most couples in that situation would use a turkey baster!|`|s1BaLV1Laa	no|`|2zC1lpfVaa	No.  And by the way, if it is not my egg, then it is not my biological son/daughter.  In this situation I would prefer to adopt a baby, rather than to deal with the moral issue.
g27LbLQsaa	its pretty, I am not keen on the nickname Gaby, I would probably use Ella as the nickname. <br>  The meaning is slightly different depending on who you ask, things like, heroine of god, might of god, etc, I don't really like the connection to god. <br>  <br>  I liked this page <a href="http://www.kabalarians.com/f/gabriella.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabalarians.com/f/gabriella.h...</a><br>  because it describes lots of different aspects to the name not just a meaning.|`|M32117Ptaa	Sound like garbage Cinderella|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	yes. i think its a very good name for a girl|`|BUvvstsjaa	yes.|`|aUs2o3Iiaa	yea|`|fPJTZwoUaa	its ok|`|acYPFNeFaa	its cute|`|jZVeXOjnaa	I think its a really cute name! :)|`|Vmt7ylcuaa	Of course, remember Gabriella Sabatini- Argentine woman tennis player|`|HsL0PYNGaa	I do. it's unique and sweet.<br>  but it reminds me of High School Musical, so not my favorite. :)|`|TUNvbXbgaa	no way too old fashioned.
C8E3fe3xaa	Yes, baby is still pretty small at 23 weeks so it has lots of room to move around and find a spot it likes and your baby just chose to sit low right now, nothing to worry about.|`|gG8oyymiaa	It took till about 25 weeks till my daughter started moving and kicking up high. It is normal.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Yes, very normal.  It's because the baby is trying to get lined up into the birthing position (head down) so you'll feel the baby move all over, including LOW. :)|`|MXXOICquaa	my baby always kicks low every now and then he will kick high but most of the time hes below where i wear my pants he stays so low its hard for them to see him on ultrasound because of my pelvic bones|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Yes, it's normal.|`|nyuB4POqaa	Yes it's normal|`|eHTbY6lhaa	i'd say it's normal. i am almost 22 weeks pregnant with my third child and i can feel him moving down low and up high.
t4HXotwEaa	ohhh goodie...here we go again.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	it should be lowered to 12weeks if at all.im not for abortions myself|`|C3sqTngtaa	Yes i do think that is should be reduced to at least 20 weeks - however, i medical situations then there should be a call for a different stance.  However with regard to my view on abortions, every situation is different and everyone has a right to chose so i am indifferent.  neither for or against|`|x8JRkRNkaa	In my opinion it shouldn't be legal at all. If you become pregnant you should take responsibility for your own actions and not make an innocent life suffer because you don't feel like doing your job. If someone really can not take care of the child they made then I think adoption is a wonderful option. Having an abortion at 24 weeks is murder. Having an abortion any time is murder. That is just my view on this. I don't judge anyone for anything they do. That doesn't mean I agree with or would advise them to do it.|`|6BhTjwoNaa	I don't judge anyone who has ever had an abortion,but since I believe  a life begins at conception, I am against abortion.If you talk to many women after they have had an abortion, the emotional trauma they go through is tremendous. It is very hard to live with.Their is a group called Rachels' Vineyard for any who have had an abortion and need some anonymous counseling.|`|GjuRYsITaa	i do most defiantly|`|8mchLCQhaa	I am Pro-Life. It is never ok to kill a baby!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Abortion in Canada is only legal up until 12 weeks. I'm actually shocked that they abort at 24 weeks in the USA! I'm 24 weeks right now and my bump moves and jumps and kicks all over the place. Couldn't imagine terminating that late, wow. If there was something wrong with the baby that was determined in ultrasound thats a different case altogether but just for the sake of birth control....thats nuts.|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	i'm strongly against it!!! its murder, no matter how much they try and dress it up. i can understand that in many cases, its a painful decision to make, especially as so many regret it after, but that child had a right to live- either with that parent or with adoptive parents. its playing god with a life. you here people saying that with an unwanted pregnancy, it ruins your body, but so can an abortion! it was never an option for me, thank god. everyone is entitled to an opinion, this is mine|`|j7fzuDxgaa	i think it should be 16 weeks at the most. depending on medical reasons for mother or/and baby. but in this day and age it should not come to abortions ie condoms, the pill, morning after etc etc. even 16 weeks seems bit late? unless there are medical reasons why would it take so long to choose if a baby it wanted or not? and when the woman had unprotected sex did she not choose to get pregnant at that time?|`|LQnKhiVMaa	yes i think it should be reduced to 12 weeks, but that is just my personal opinion x x unless an extreme case.... i am not one for abortion, but can understand why some women may choose to have one, but as someone earlier said, u should no by 12 weeks, whether u want your baby or not in most cases|`|g9vw4ovGaa	If it is a medical necessity, then no. But if she just doesn't feel like being a mother, then she shouldn't wait til she's 24 weeks to decide that. By that time the baby is moving really well and everything.|`|758cDKEFaa	i think its murder at any point.<br>  i think the legal time should be lowered loads.|`|mmMgfhf2aa	It's not my opinion that counts, it's the person making the descision and everyone else should stay out of it!|`|Vd78hDlKaa	I think it should be lowered to a time when the baby is not viable unless it's a complete emergency situation.<br>  <br>  However - that said - I'm pro-choice all the way.|`|uKMTYj4haa	some diseases cannot be discovered till around 24 weeks so no, i don't think it should be changed.

I'd understand if someone told me that.  But tell them immediately (as in right now), because they will need time to find someone else.

BUOJJpaCaa	I don't see why education isn't working. Maybe they are getting it too late in school?<br>  <br>  I have been sexually active since I was 16 and have yet to get pregnant, but I also always use some sort of birth control.<br>  <br>  Maybe sex education should start in middle school, maybe as early as fifth grade in some places. Last year there were at least 2 sixth graders pregnant.<br>  <br>  I don't think that they should be made to put their children up for adoption, but I think the quality of care needs to be looked into by the state. Many teenage mothers (some do) do not actually care for their children and either do not know how or are not willing to learn.<br>  <br>  I also think the financial situation needs to be looked at carefully too. I do not want my tax dollars to be spent taking care of irresponsible girls and their children. If you can afford to take care of the baby, good for you. If you can't, you don't need one.<br>  <br>  A previous answerer wrote about how if you can't afford IVF then you can't afford a baby? Hello, IVF is extremely expensive. I can afford to take care of a kid, but  I can't afford IVF (not that I need to but still). IVF is a cost that has to be paid upfront. Costs of child rearing are spread out.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	That is absolutaly rediculous!!! There are already so many unadopted children, You think throwing thousands more a year would help?! The state still ends up paying for them.<br>  <br>  Yes teenage Pregnancy is a growing epidemic! But taking a child away from its mother for no reason except for shes under 18 is unthinkable. Just because they are underage does not mean they aren't capeable mothers!<br>  <br>  You have obviously never delt with the adoption system, and while it is an amazing program, it sucks. Invitro mothers know about adoption but they want theyre own(otherwise they would have adopted) And what about The people that adopt exotic babies from foreign countrys should't they adopt the unwanted children here first?<br>  <br>  I would rather have every teenager fed birthcontrol rather than you take theyre children away.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	I believe both are to blame.....Kids today are way more educated than say 20 years ago, so I find it extremely difficult to believe that these kids are unaware of condoms and other contraceptive ideas, I mean it is everywhere you go, schools, public washrooms, in public places, radio, t.v.,  I guess you could say that the kids are just selfish and want to do what they want to, I did too when i was young, but at least the girls i dated wanted to use protection, it was glove or no love............I don't know, I guess society will just have to keep paying for these selfish acts of stupidity.............|`|e60754e2c47d3732e670fc3cfec1373eaa	your obviously a man- yes there are a lot of underage people having sex, but they're not all vicky pollards!! i had a friend at school who got pregnant at 14, her wee boy is now 9, she has a good career, married and a 4 yr old daughter (this is all to the same person). of course there are alot out there that stay on benefits- but some actually want a good life for their baby. what an idiotic person you are- with short-sighted views. it takes 2 to tango, girls don't get pregnant on their own- theres no such thing as an immaculate conception!!!!!|`|TXmAx8jwaa	i mean im NOT against teenage pregnancy but i also dont give a damn if that makes sence. they know what there getting them selfs into having sex at such a young age so they need to deal with it. if they are bringing a baby into this world then no i dont think it should be taken away from them, that newborn baby still needs his/her real mum after all.|`|QydVDaXRaa	What a disgraceful suggestion.

Heard of rape before? Heard of an accident? A condom could break. Most teens are against abortion, me being one of them. If teens are pregnant and ask adivce on this wesite and you don't like it, simply bypass the questions. What you are suggesting isn't taking the child into account. A baby is a living, breathing, little person who needs their mom to look after them.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	That isn't really going to stop teens from getting pregnant- obviously most of them aren't having sex hoping to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  In some cases, you're right about what should be done.

And I hate when people jump to conclusions about people being pregnant, especially if they don't say if they are ttc or if it was accidental and people have a go at them thinking they are 'stupid little teenagers sleeping around' and they tell them to wear a condom next time and say they've probably contracted an sti or std.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I feel the same way.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	it takes 2 to tango. what happens to the guy who gets the girl pregnant. does he get punished|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	First off no there isn't enough education about sex and the consequences of it. They teach in school is abstinence alone nothing else.  We have millions of ADULT parents not teaching their children about sex, who are leaving it up to the school system to teach them and once again all they teach is abstinence.  These kids are going out and find out for themselves.  Because of lack of education not because there is enough.<br>  <br>  Also I blame those real baby classes that they now have in highschool and some middle schools across the country, Those fake babies lead these girls into believing thats all it takes to be a parent. When those of us who are parents know it takes a whole hell of a lot more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Taking babies away from teen moms? How retarded is that! How are you going to guarantee that these children aren't going to end up with worse parents than the ones you claim they already have? Do you happen to know not all people on welfare are teen parents? That adult parents are also on welfare?  Did you know in some states like mine teenage pregnant girls don't automatically get welfare? That they are still the responibility of their parents?  In the state I live you are not eligiable for food stamps until the age of 21 under that, you are still concidered your parents responsiblity. You can get medical help but not the other. <br>  <br>  Do you also realize most children taken away from their parents are from parents who are adults not teens?  I could go on and on about this subject. But i can tell that you haven't really looked into it. You are just going off what you see on the news or tv not real life.<br>  <br>  I was a teen mom BEFORE the real/fake baby thing.|`|qv493CGiaa	Teenage pregnancy is just a way of life now. Teenage girls are going to have sex and get pregnant no matter what people say to them. <br>  Although education through it all will decrease numbers it isn't going to eliminate teenage pregnancy. <br>  And personally i think your idea of putting the babies up for adoption is ridiculous. Although the mothers are young, alot of them are still able to provide through their kids without benefits and most of them are GOOD parents no matter what people thing. <br>  Personally i think people should focus more on people in their 60's and 70's having IVF and having kids! Honestly what sort of life are the children they have going to have? <br>  I'm sorry but thats just my personal opinion but no matter how much you protest against teenage pregnancy, teenagers are still going to have kids!|`|aGXankr2aa	You're right in that education hasn't worked.  I hate to say this, but I can't think of anything else we can do.  It'll be terrible for the young mum too lose their baby, but with the current increase in underage - and I don't mean of consenting age, mothers, maybe the time has come for such drastic measures. I did notice that you put that they should go to couples in your question, and that I do agree with.  It saddens me that I can't think of a better solution.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	i know in the past week ive seen like 20 questions about 14 yr olds being prego and scard i think that they should be forced to take care of the baby and made to work if they want to have sex like an adult and do things only adults should be doing then they can be adults maby if enough kids are made to do this the word will get out and they will stop having sex...<br>  idk its just a thought|`|clc6qQDAaa	I dont agree with you. You should never take baby from their parents unless the baby is coming to harm or being neglected. Teen parents are not unfit to take care of a baby. Any mother gets money from the government up until the child is 18. You will not be only punishing the teens but this will give the child emotional and social problems when they grow up.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Its more than likely the boys fault sooooooooooooooo what to do now?

eNBoG2L5aa	Something could be pinched.  I got this quite a bit, especially in my big toe!  What helped was getting adjusted by a Chiropractor.  Mine had experience adjusting pregnant women.|`|7YFhpbyUaa	Hello, <br>  <br>  This may be because you are retaining a lot of water during pregnancy or if you have bad blood circulation. You should check with your Doc, Just in case.|`|9THRCVtOaa	sounds like mine (28 weeks)!|`|9Fz5A67kaa	yea|`|kwMuRDFjaa	sciatic nerves|`|wKuQC4yTaa	yes, it is sciatic pains. i get them already and they have been getting worse for a month now. now i get them in my arms and legs.
HXfHkoSHaa	Soon after my son was born, I found my 2 yr old splashing around in the toilet! At least it was flushed.  She often forgets to flush, so I guess it could've been much worse!<br>  <br>  ETA:  also yesterday at our Sunday meeting, I told her to pull up her tights because they were coming down a little bit. Before I knew what was going on she had her little skirt around her ankles and was yanking her tights up.  I guess she felt she couldn't adjust her tights with her skirt on.  It really is always something.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	my 2 year old got up in the middle of the night once,unbeknownced to me of course,I woke to this overwhelming smell, I go out into the hallway and see food coloring and little footprints leading into the bathroom, as i opened the door, i saw a little boy covered from head to toe in white powder where he had emptied ( n0 kidding) 5 full bottles of baby powder mixed with 3 bottles of lotion, mixed with 3 bottles of conditioner,smeared all over the bathroom.  All I could think of was that I wanted this boy to live.If his father saw this he would kill him!i sent the boy to his room and spent the next 4 hours trying to quietly clean this mess before his father woke up. I had to mop 4 times. and yes...I took a picture.|`|BcjFssaEaa	well my daughter only 7 month so i have all this 2 *** but my friend has a lil boy who is 4 n he has a real vivid imagination, once he flooded his bathroom n it dripped from upstairs down threw the kitchen light. when his mum asked him why he did it he replied "it wasnt me! it was Tinker (the dog) who put toilet roll in the plug n then a scarey bear made a hole in the floor n the water dripped down, i couldnt stop it because im only a lil boy n he was a big scarey bear"????????<br>  i was histerical when i heard it, he well thought it out lol<br>  best of luck xx|`|IuuwLnFIaa	lol ok?
Ve6RAuq3aa	if ur concerned see a doc but otherwise i reckon all of them are linked together<br>  <br>  tight shoulders and neck can cause really bad headaches... if u sit hunched over or if u slouch slightly when i walk (i imagine thats an easy trap to fall into when pregnant)  then just a heat pack on ur shoulders and neck, and perhaps some nurofen (ibuprofen) will help. and try and improve posture if it is causing the problem...but it would be wise to ur doctor|`|9THRCVtOaa	yes don't worry its gonna get worse.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Back pain in early pregnancy is generally because of the way that the hormone progesterone affects a woman’s body. The progesterone softens the ligaments and discs in a woman’s back that support her upper body. This pain will sometimes be accompanied by muscle spasms or cramps in the lower back as well. For some women, lower back pain during early pregnancy can also be caused by a urinary tract infection.<br>  <br>  The best treatment for lower back pain during early pregnancy tends to be exercise. A variety of exercises, such as pelvic rocking, mini-crunches, and walking are all excellent exercises that will help to relieve back pain during early pregnancy.|`|1w41ReD7aa	Well I didn't even know I was pregnant, until I was 6weeks.

You know i dont care if teens have sex but if your going to the get on BC an if the only way is to tell mom to take you to the Gyno then tell her!! Thats a lot better then getting pregnant.|`|Bw18seFqaa	you have to find a way to a clinic or Dr to get a prescription.  If you see a Dr, you then have to go to a pharmacy to get the prescription.. most clinics like planned parenthood can sell b/c there.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you cant find a way to get there, you are out of luck on getting any prescription birth control.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	planned parenthood|`|46ijdaH6aa	Have a friend, or family member take you to a clinic. They will give you a depo shot which last 3 months at a time. It's also birth control and works A LOT better than the birth control pills. Go every 3 months, you won't have to worry about her finding the pills, and your all set. Just be careful!! Dont sleep with just anyone, there are many many more diseases out there now a days and are VERY common to get. I wouldnt recommend sex at all, until you find someone your Truly in love with, and date for a while. Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  BTW if you have a ride to have sex, than you can get a ride to go to a clinic. Ask someone, anyone. There ARE ways .. Ask the boy your with. You do NOT want to end up pregnant at 16.|`|0AGjMJ2Baa	First off, Go to your primary doctor, they should write you a prescritption for birth control. If they wont, look into the free clinics around your area. They will help you not only with birth control, but in educating you on the different forms as well as educate you in other areas as well.<br>  Best of luck!|`|sIr2fWh6aa	You can ask your primary doctor to give you a RX for birth control.  They aren't allowed to tell your parents due to patient confidentiality.  You're old enough to have it, and the doctor should write the RX.|`|1w41ReD7aa	Well,you seem really immature to even starting to have sex, if you can't tell your mom. You know using birthcontrol&condoms, you still have a chance of getting pregnant, so what will you tell your mom then? I think you should just let her know.Goodluck.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	Oh just have some fun who needs birth control. Sex is what all the cool kids are doing, just get it on already!! LOL <br>  Why not use a condom? you can get em at the drugstore.
J38v75bvaa	i had made the mistake of telling my hubby we need to try everything before we give it to the baby.<br>  <br>  he took that as he has 2 try my breast milk lol. so i pumped a little into a bottle and let him. he said it was really sweet like if you were to put a bunch of sugar in cows milk. and it was like drinking red bull because it gave him so much energy for about 10-15 mins then he slept for about 2hrs!!!<br>  <br>  i have been breast feeding my son for about 10months and for the past month i only do it at night.<br>  <br>  the other day during "us" time my hubby was playing with my breast and got a taste of my milk. total mood kill!!!! he said it was the most nasty taste ever. i guess it changes over time. <br>  <br>  if your wanting to try it and shes ok with that i think its ok. but have her pump a little into a bottle of cup that way you dont feel like her "baby" but deffently dont do it during sex!!!! its just too weird having your hubby in your you know what and feeling milk come out your breast...you think of the baby and thats just too weird.|`|jD8TxlLfaa	I've never done it. I have heard of people doing it. I say if you want to try it, go for it. As long as you both are open to the idea, it shouldn't be a bad experience.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have discussed it, once we heard of other people doing it, and it weirds us both out. That's just us, though. :)|`|TlFnIei0aa	If she hasn't had the baby yet then it's not actually milk in her boobs, it's a thick yellow colostrum.

Xjms76n1aa	I'm not an expert, but that's a pretty low level.   Was this your first hcg test, or did you have a prior one?  What did your doctor say?  hCG levels can vary widely--the important thing is that they should double every 48-72 hours.<br>  <br>  The other thing that I'm thinking is that maybe you have your dates off, as to when you concieved ?)  Your level is closer to what it would be with a 4 week pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Definitely talk to your doctor.  I hope everything works out for you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Guideline to hCG levels during pregnancy:<br>  hCG levels in weeks from LMP (gestational age)* :<br>  <br>  3 weeks LMP: 5 - 50 mIU/ml <br>  4 weeks LMP: 5 - 426 mIU/ml <br>  5 weeks LMP: 18 - 7,340 mIU/ml <br>  6 weeks LMP: 1,080 - 56,500 mIU/ml <br>  7 - 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 - 229,000 mIU/ml <br>  9 - 12 weeks LMP: 25,700 - 288,000 mIU/ml <br>  13 - 16 weeks LMP: 13,300 - 254,000 mIU/ml <br>  17 - 24 weeks LMP: 4,060 - 165,400 mIU/ml <br>  25 - 40 weeks LMP: 3,640 - 117,000 mIU/ml <br>  Non-pregnant females: <5.0 mIU/ml <br>  Postmenopausal females: <9.5 mIU/ml <br>  * These numbers are just a GUIDELINE-- every woman’s level of hCG can rise differently. It is not necessarily the level that matters but rather the change in the level.

4ywNkfqEaa	My 9 month old is very similar to yours. The best thing i did was start putting her to bed later...8-8.30pm. That helped a lot. I dont think ur baby is napping too much. Babies that age are meant to nap about that much. So i would say uv got that right. so dont change it. Just try doing everything a bit later, so that u can put her to sleep later.<br>  How about<br>  dinner at 6pm<br>  bath at 7pm <br>  bottle at 8pm...then straight to bed.<br>  <br>  As far as the night goes, try picking her up, and rocking her to sleep just for a couple of minutes, then put her back down. do it a few times if u have to...she probably just needs some comfort..but then let her get herself to sleep.she will soon get used to the idea of making herslef sleep. mines can make herself got to sleep, but sometimes just wants a cuddle..or chances her luck to get up and play. Also mines takes anything from a few minutes to 40 minutes to get back to sleep at times.u just have to let them know that they can have a hug, but need to sleep.<br>  hope it gets better soon|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	Cut out a daytime nap... She should be having one after lunch, for about an hour, then get her up.|`|fjZeVLOQaa	poor u,u must be tired aswell,try cuttin out her afernoon nap and keeping her up a bit later and also try giving her her last bottle a bit later might work ,if not discuss it with ur health visitor|`|kprKXEOSaa	You basically have to decide what you're willing to do and go from there.  If you're not willing to let her cry for a few minutes, then she will never be a good sleeper.  Babies have to learn to self-soothe, going back in and popping the binky in her mouth isn't helping her learn to put herself back to sleep.<br>  <br>  My oldest child has always been a poor sleeper.  We have struggled with it always, and he's 5 1/2 now.  There was one night when he was almost a year old, he woke up as usual, and it made me so mad.  I thought, you know what?  You're old enough to sleep through the night.  I found that nothing I was doing was really helping him, anyway.  I would usually go get him, rock him, give him his binky, but he would still be up for an hour or more fussing.  That was the night I turned the monitor off and let him work it out on his own.  I figured if he really needed me, he would let me know.  He eventually calmed down and went back to sleep.  I left the monitor off after that, and he would let me know if he needed me--he would cry louder and I would go get him.  Like I said, you have to decide what you're willing to do.  If you're not willing to have a few nights of listening to her cry, then you should stop complaining about her not sleeping through the night, because you are helping her form her habits.<br>  <br>  As far as the throwing up, I've mentioned this before, and I always get a lot of thumbs down for it.  But here goes, anyway.  My second child tried the throwing up thing.  The first night she did it, I went charging in there and gave her a bath and changed her sheets.  2 hours later, she calmed down.  The next night, she threw up again.  I decided I didn't want to have this be our night time routine for the next 3 years, so you know what?  I figured a little throw up wasn't going to hurt her.  It didn't hurt her to have a little throw up on her jammies, and she didn't do it again.  My sister's baby now stays up until midnight or 1 in the morning, because she learned that if she cried enough, she could make herself throw up, and my sister didn't want her to throw up, so she doesn't make her go to bed.  <br>  <br>  You have to decide what you're willing to do.  But once you make the choice, it really isn't fair to keep complaining about it.|`|pDRAciBnaa	it does sound like she is sleeping alot during the day,holly is 10mos and since 8mos old has been sleeping at 10am for 30mins and 2pm for 15-30mins.<br>  <br>  i would try (it may be hard and she may be grumpy) give her less sleep during the day. she sounds as though shes getting plenty to eat aswell so that shouldnt be the issue,although i would feed her if your not already right before you put her to bed!!<br>  <br>  maybe she is just not ready to be sleeping through,some of my friends babys who are 11mos still dont sleep properly,i agree with not letting her 'cry it out' but you do need to be strong and just go in stroke her tummy/face and give her,her dummy back and walk out the room,dont use lights or over stimulate her. keep doing this leaving the gap you go back in longer each time,eventually she will realise that although you come to her,youre not getting her out of bed so there isnt much point of fussing :)<br>  <br>  good luck.
6PR8Cj2raa	Ive went through two rounds of 50mg clomid. The first one back in Nov, and I did get pregnant but it ended in miscarriage. This last time in Jan, I ended up pregnant also. I go in a wk to make sure everythings fine. Im keepig my fingers crossed!! Good luck to you|`|1CryEnb3aa	I go tomorrow to my dr to get on clomid.

7WTjHgSTaa	sometimes your body delays itself. this can be brought on by a lot of stress and worry. if all four tests have said that you werent pregnant then you probably are not. also, sometimes if you have sex right before your period, it can be delayed that way. try to relax some and not think about it so much and your period will come. if by all means it does not then please go to the doctor.    i hope this helps.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Your period is not always on time.

h85kkDsbaa	Hi there, i wouldn't worry to much about getting her up a little earlier for her morning feed, if she is hungry then feed her and if she is waking up unhappy then it must be because she is hungry. My son is nearly 7 months and does this also he will go to bed at 7:30pm and will sometimes wake happy and chat to himself and sometimes he will wake up crying and wants to be feed straight away, he will wake between 6 - 7:30am.<br>  <br>  Also i think that as parents we forget that babies are just like us some days they are hungrier then others and somedays they are more tired then others. Just go with your little girl, as long as she isn't waking in the night for a feed then that's great for a breastfeed baby.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps good luck X

RsFxgN4Gaa	You can't help him. He will not be helped until he decides he needs help. All you can do is let him know you love him, you will always support him emotionally, and make sure you do not enable him!<br>  <br>  Don't give him money, don't give him anything of value. Make him a meal, buy him a meal, give him a shirt or pants. But do not give him anything he can use to feed his habit.<br>  <br>  Let him know where he can get help, let him know you are there when he's ready to get help.<br>  <br>  Other than that you have to put him in God's hands and let him work through his problems.<br>  <br>  In the meantime there are support groups for families of those who are dealing with drug addictions.

1CryEnb3aa	I have not had this.  But, I wanted to share with you what happened with my first pregnancy.  I was told I had placenta previa.  The dr sid I would start bleeding and cramping and lose my baby.  I would not make it to term.  I was devastated.  However, I made it to my next apt.  They asked if I has started cramping?  I said no, I didn't even feel pregnant.  He said that is not a good sign of a strong pregnancy.  I was upset again.  It seemed like they wanted me to lose my baby.  I was put on bed rest at 12wks and stayed on bed rest till I delivered at 37 1/2 weeks!  I never did bleed and had a vaginal delivery.  So, try to relax.  Everything can work out just fine.  I had a happy, healthy baby.  You can too.  Just take it one day at a time and relax!!|`|EyKJ737daa	I've never heard of fluid in the uterus!? Isn't that still like in the womb though?

RIbS6yzYaa	first off good on you for breastfeeding <br>  <br>  2nd NO WATER babies who are breastfed do not need water and they metabolis it differently to adults and can get sick from too much water. <br>  <br>  3rd at 5 weeks old he is hitting a classic growth spurt age.  best advice,  feed, feed feed, jsut feed him,  if he moves feed him, if he looks at you sideways, feed him, of he farts, feed him, every hours half- 2 hours is normal during growth spurt age.  up nursing for around 3 days and it shoud ease up.  i know its hard, i know its tiering,  i have dont it 4 times. and i will be doing it all again this summer/autumn,  im due my 5th baby then. <br>  <br>  check out <br>  www.kellymom.com for more breastfeeding info and good luck,  hang in there, its a heck of a ride but my gosh its fun.  im 17 months in and still going strong with my youngest.  keep it up.  its well worth it.  and ITS FREE.  <br>  <br>  oh also try skin to skin contact with baby if he is unsetled at times, worked for me.  just snuggle up with baby with no top on, nursing as much as you can.  <br>  <br>  my moto during the early months was "this too shall pass" and it did.|`|baI5G8yLaa	My boy was exactly the same as yours! oh i was so tired!<br>  Give formula a go it wont hurt, but he my get confused with bottle feeding and breast feeding mine did in the end i resorted to pumping and bottle feeding that way he still go the good stuff and to be honest he took to it better i noticed a bigger difference Straight away <br>  i think you my find the reason for him constantly on your breast is because he is using it as a dummy/pacifier But at around that age in the night he found his thumb (thank god)<br>  He is still Young and getting used to things mine was still like that until 8 wks old<br>  <br>  I also forced a bed time routine on him that my help<br>  Honestly my boy was horrible i even got to the point where i didn't like him much don't get me wrong i lovvveeedd him to pieces but he just made everything so hard then the bed time routine and bottle feeding he was a totally different boy<br>  <br>  good luck|`|GKVZyHCHaa	You can't rely on formula to get your baby to sleep longer.  My daughter is 7 weeks old and I recently switched from breast feeding to bottle feeding and she goes no longer between feeds at all.  The one advantage is, however, your partner can help with the night feeds if you mix breast and bottle.<br>  <br>  As for boiled water, as you're breast feeding then there is no need to introduce boiled water at all.  Baby will get all the fluid he needs from your breast milk, even if you only give him one breast feed a day.|`|7lPspOboaa	Something to try with your baby if you want to keep breastfeeding.  Bring the baby into your room.  I brought my little one into my bed for a middle of the night feeding.  If I fell asleep it was okay.  If not I would replace him in his bed.  <br>  <br>  Your son my be going through a growth spurt which means he's hungry more often which would happen with formula also.<br>  <br>  Good luck I understand.  I have been there 3 times.  I kept nursing but I would not feel bad if you can't continue for any reasons.  Nursing is a personal choice.|`|xGI9z01Maa	I had to start my son on food earlier then most children.  He was just that hungry.  But talk to the doctor first.  He might be having a different issue then just needing to eat.  He might have something wrong with processing the food.  If he is weight is down, then the doctor might know what the issue is.|`|no4tGa45aa	Formula before bed might make him sleep longer - it may not. However if it doesnt - at least dad can get up for some night feeds! I would keep breast feeding during the day though :) Hope you get some sleep soon!|`|e105cfb2a3df44e1d4835131ebd93824aa	This is a difficult one. Breast fed babies do tend to go through phases of feeding little and often, as they go throw growth spurts (typically around 5 - 6 weeks) they need more calories. Your milk supply can take a while to catch up. The problem with feeding with a bottle is that your breasts don't get the message that they need to produce more milk. As baby feeds continuously then your breasts recognise the need to produce more milk to keep up with our babies demands. <br>  Of course you need to apply common sense to this!! This time is precious and if you are exhausted and fed up you aren't going to enjoy your baby!! I work on a Neonatal Unit and this is a common problem. Some of our mums persevere through it, others decide to 'top up' with a bottle when baby has had some time at the breast. The only problem with this is your milk supply may start to diminish. <br>  I think you need to decide what is best for you and your family, I don't think many people appreciate how difficult breastfeeding can be, our breastfeeding coordinator couldn't breastfeed her children at all! Its one of those things. <br>  If you think this has gone for a while and its possible you simply haven't enough milk then it might be worth trying introducing some formula feeds, you have done well breastfeeding for 5 weeks. You need to balance out the need to breastfeed against the need to enjoy your baby.<br>  We recommend our mums breastfeed for 20 mins then top up with a bottle. This way your breasts are still getting stimulation and baby is deciding himself how much more he needs following a breastfeed.<br>  If you decide to do formula feeds at night or alternate, its likely your supply will diminish.<br>  Its your choice, good luck Xx<br>  p.s expressing and giving by bottle can be a good compromise, you can see how much milk he is getting and add formula if there isnt quite enough. Also boiled water is fine but not too much, you dont want baby filling up with water and missing out on the calories he needs.
1VdQbx3xaa	10th to 18th day after period is high risk avoid these!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	you can ovulate at any time. even when you have your period. if you dont want a baby use protection at all times. there is no safe time to have sex and not get pregnant.
GUVl3KiYaa	i do feel a man must have some sort of right. The best thing to do, but unrealistic, is to have her sign a waiver prior to the intercourse. If she gets pregnant, I WANT to keep the baby, but I feel she must have a choice. it's only fair to me that I have a choice too, in the event I DO NOT WANT the baby. If I do not want the baby, then it's her choice to keep the baby or not, without me. If I want the baby, I must also have some right to keep the baby, and she can be involved or not. Like I said, the only fair way is to have a common contract that can be freely distributed at hospitals and doctors offices.|`|TY2cs2mzaa	Of course its the womens body, putting it bluntly the most men squirt and leave. Where are they for the nine months of reponsibilty previously to the baby being born. I hear time and time again, "why didnt i have a choice in whether she kept that child, why do i have to pay, she lied about being on birth control." I hear Im too young to be a dad.<br>  <br>  If your partner is pregnant then you must have discussed pregnancy previously to having sex, otherwise why would you risk getting pregnant if you don`t want children. The responsibilty of birth control should not lie on one partner. <br>  <br>  Pregnancy is NOT the worse thing to come out of unprotected sex.  <br>  <br>  If the man wants the baby well, I feel this should have been discussed before having sex, because bottom line it is her responsibilty for nine months prior to birth, 18 years after, its her body and her life, not his. Unfortunately thats the reality of it.|`|Uq8x0JY5aa	Personally I think sex was made for marriage.  I think that married people should be the only ones having sex, so if a pregnancy happens, then it's perfect. <br>  <br>  That being said, it's doesn't matter if the female is lying to him - yeah, it totally stinks for him, but by having sex with her, he's saying that he knows that there's apossibilityy that a pregnancy could happen.  Even the pill isn't foolproof.  <br>  <br>  I DO think that the male should have a say in abortion.  It shouldn't be just the woman's choice, the child is half the mom & half the dad, so it shouldn't be just the mom's choice about if they kill the baby or not.  <br>  <br>  I do think that there's a problem with some of the child support money stuff, but again, having sex outside of marriage can cause those problems.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	1) Yes, it's possible accusing the woman of lying about birth control wouldn't be listened to - which is why guys have to be careful and use a condom unless they absolutely trust the woman and trust her to tell the truth when she says she's on the pill. And trust her to take the pill correctly. If a guy leaves it up to her, he needs to know it can go wrong and he should be held responsible. I think it's reprehensible for women to trick a guy, but it's hard to prove. The guy knows when he has sex, that pregnancy can happen. End of story. If he doesn't like it, no sex.<br>  <br>  2) I don't get what you mean. She can want to be a single mother but still need financial support from the father. Are you saying the child should suffer financially if the woman and man split up, and the taxpayer have to make up the deficit?<br>  <br>  3) There's a formula, google "child support calculator", there's a different one for each jursidction. Goes on both parents' income and other factors. Obviously it varies depending on how much the guy makes.<br>  <br>  4) Because it is her body and it's wrong to be able to force somebody else to continue with a pregnancy. I feel sad if a guy wants a baby and it's aborted but I think it's even more wrong to force women to go through with pregnancies they don't want.<br>  <br>  The reason men don't have equal rights is purely biological. It's not possible. They would have all the same rights if they could get pregnant, but they can't. The alternative is guys forcing women to become effectively breeders, or forcing women to get abortions, or refusing to pay if they made a kid just because they think it's "unfair". Be careful when, who and how you have sex with and you can hopefully avoid most of these issues.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	NO one, man or woman, should have sex with a person they do not trust 100%. If they have sex, even with protection, they are saying I am ready for the responsibility of becoming a parent. <br>  The ONLY way I could see such an idiotic argument working in court is if she claimed to have had a hysterectomy as obviously that would be fairly safe sex as far as conception goes. Anything else...absolutely you take that risk!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	the only question im going to answer here is this:<br>  <br>  when you go to court over child support they determine how much you are going to pay based on a scale. they take into account how much you are making. the do NOT base everyone on the same pay. (or atleast that's how it's done in this state)|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Males have the right to get up and leave the child's life and never look back.  The mother has to stay and take care of the child no matter what, unless she wants to gives the baby up for adoption and never see her child again.<br>  <br>  How many males out there are supposed to pay child support and simply don't?   TONS of them.<br>  <br>  What if the man wants the baby and then when the baby is 1 he decides he doesn't want the responsibility anymore?  He leaves.  It's not like he goes to jail for leaving, he simply leaves.  <br>  <br>  And child support is based on income so not all men pay the same amount.<br>  <br>  One last thing, paternity fraud? There are DNA tests.   LOL Lying about BC?  If he doesn't want a baby, DON'T HAVE SEX.  Even if a woman is on birth control or they use condoms there is ALWAYS chance a pregnancy can result.   The same goes for a woman.<br>  <br>  Abortion rights? Blame biology.  The woman has to go through pregnancy and childbirth, women have died during childbirth.  As I said above, when the baby is 1 and the guy decides to leave, who has the responsibility? The woman. <br>  <br>  And what does Prop 8 have to do with this?|`|laVH1Bz3aa	first of all, do you know what Prop 8 is? its completely unrelated to your topic dude.<br>  <br>  anyways, child support is determined by how much money the person makes and how much it costs to support the child. a parent who makes more money would pay more than a parent who makes less. pretty straightforward.<br>  <br>  regarding paternity fraud, i think it would be pretty impossible to prove in court. plus, courts are historically biased towards the mother, so i don't even know that it would get you off the hook.<br>  <br>  pregnancy is a medical condition that a woman experiences. the "favor" is given to women because the woman's body that goes through it.<br>  <br>  have fun writing your paper about how men are the victims of the system lol|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Just wanted to share. <br>  I had a friend with  very low sperm count. His chances of having his own child was like 0.1%. (which he desperately longed for) He started dating this girl when she was about 4 months pregnant. He was there throe her pregnancy, at the birth. Raising this girl as his own. When this little girl was about 7 years old. The miracle happened. They conceived. The dr confirmed it, the works. She got an abortion. <br>  He was hart broken to say the least. I feel men should have more say.

They play basketball in the fall, they are getting ready to start volleyball in a couple of weeks (my 7th grader has already played volleyball). They also play softball & soccer. This Summer we are going to offer tennis for the first time. My girls are really excited about it. They also do swimming. Sports are soooo important. Have her try everything. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to play next year.<br>  <br>  :0)<br>  .|`|cAtWxJG1aa	you don't say how old she is, but I'd tell her she needs to pick one more thing for exercise and she can pick which thing.  <br>  <br>  a lot of kids love being on a team.  most of my kids have loved soccer from around age 5.  softball is fun, too, but some kids find it less exciting because there are longer periods of just standing around and waiting, whereas everyone is always on the move in soccer.<br>  <br>  one of my kids never liked sports with balls and didn't particularly like team sports, either.  she has adored gymnastics, ice skating, swimming, and rock climbing.  <br>  <br>  it doesn't matter at all what sport they're doing as long as it's something that keeps them active and seems fun to them.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	As a black belt in Tae-kwon-do and an ex soccer player.  I have to go with the martial arts or soccer.  <br>  <br>  Martial arts are great for discipline, coordination and fitness.  If you are worried at all about the contact aspect some schools practice non contact martial arts where the focus is on control of your movements and students are taught how to judge kicks and strikes so as not to make contact with other students.  Martial arts aren't necessarily about fighting but can also concentrate on the "Pattern" side of the Arts where students learn patterns of moves according to their belt level.  Most good schools also encourage higher levels to teach lower belt levels.<br>  <br>  Soccer is a great social game and encourages fitness.  A great way to encourage team spirit and teach a player how to be part of a team.|`|cteyFJxhaa	My kids are all hockey and baseball players.  I always wished the girl had shown some interest in soccer instead of ball just because she struggles with her weight and soccer's better exercise and very affordable.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	soccer is a team sport, she would valuable experience by working together with other girls.|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	My daughter was in a youth soccer league when she was younger.  She absolutely loved it.|`|zdWDkadraa	My sisters and I played ice hockey from a young age. Play that she'll probably never have to worry about weight, that sport works your whole body out haha. We all loved it.<br>  <br>  Soccer is really popular though and is a nice social game and can be played everywhere which is great. I know most of my friends growing up played that. <br>  <br>  More than anything though, what does she feel? Is there anything she's shown an interest in or said she thought looked fun?|`|uUJXS3nsaa	actually, i dont any experiences yet, i m not a father!<br>  i heard frm many of ma frenz that little grls lyk to dance and most of them prefer balley dancing.<br>  if u dont wanna put her in that, than i think u shud jst giv her smetym and then ask her only.<br>  hope i helped u.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Well ask her what sport she wants to play! Don't force her to do it if she doesn't want to! The whole point of sports is to be fun.
ZYlr9TSBaa	Wow her partner is an ***. It's HER labour, SHE should decide who's there and who isn't. As a mother who gave birth recently, I would've been mortified if my baby's father's mother had been in the room. Maybe show her husband this question, make him realise HE is being EXTREMELY SELFISH.|`|iMULlxdgaa	well close sister of course.  MIL too if she was cool like that...I don't know what your MIL is likebut if my sister was closer to me than my sister. only someone you relaly trust should be there with you.|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	I think it was very rude of his mother to even ask to be there, it is a very difficult time & you want those closest to you with you. Your sister can have who ever she wants there with her & it sounds like she wants you there. Her husband is being totally unfair by making her feel guilty about his rude mother! <br>  <br>  Speak to your sister about it & tell her that you will be there for her if she wants you there.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	do you have a midwife where you will have your baby at? Phone her before your next hospital appointment and explain your problem. Conspire with her.<br>  <br>  Tell your partner you'd like the midwife's opinion, explain it in greater detail, then let the midwife tell him how the expectant mother swears at, insults and throws things at anyone in range while she is going through the most painful experience of her life.<br>  <br>  Does he really want his mother there to be the target of that?|`|xnhwmontaa	Your close sister. That is foolish. My mother in law wasnt in there with me and my husband was fine with it. But if he is really serious about not being in the room as much as you hate it you may have to sit this one out. Please do not make a big thing out of this. Your sister is going through a lot and doesnt need any added pressure or stress.|`|T864ejaiaa	i would let my mother in law in. she is the grand mother. it's not only fair but right. you sister will have her joy. it would be right for her to have the grandmothers in the room to. after all this is your mother in laws grand child's birth. good luck|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Both the husband and his mother are nuts. No woman would want her mother in law in the room when she's giving birth. I, personally, didn't even allow my daughter's father in the room, just me and my mother.<br>  <br>  Your sister's husband has no say in who is in that room, he is not the one giving birth. He should feel privileged that she wants him there at all.|`|8pup9oWhaa	I had my mother in law at nora's birth, but we get along very well.<br>  <br>  If your sister gives in to her partner then she will always have to. i would suggest she has just her partner, that way no one can complain|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Your sister should be the only one who decides this.  She needs someone in there who will make her feel at ease, not someone who her partner decides.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	i would tell him to **** off and be in their and you tell his mom how stupid she is since they are not close and be like its nuthing personal but you are not wanted i am so get over it|`|aGwjf2y4aa	who the hell would want their mother in law their unless u are ex close which many of us arent eh!!!  its a special event in ur life and ur partner should except this hes not the one popping it out is he how selfish!!|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Why does her partner get a say?? <br>  She should tell him until he pushes out a baby she is going to decide.|`|CCLLnSrGaa	sister not mum in law|`|jLYTKr33aa	I personally would rather have my mother - in - law.  She's a wonderful grandmother to my son and an absolute angel on Earth.  I love my sister, but she's really not a baby person.  That's just me, though.<br>  The mother should only have those with whom she feels comfortable in the room.  The goal is to have the mother as relaxed and comfortable as possible, and everyone needs to respect that.  If your sister would rather have just you and the father, then her MIL should respect that.  If she would rather have the father and her MIL, then you need to respect that.  If she decides that she'd rather just have the father and nobody else, then you'll both have to accept it.  <br>  By the way, the father has no say over who's in the room.  That's up to the expectant mother and the expectant mother alone.|`|zdWDkadraa	It's your sister with her legs in the air, spread for all to see, and therefor it should come down to who SHE wants there. Whether it's her grandchild or not, I wouldn't want my mother in law to see me half naked, nor screaming in pain. Maybe try and word it to the father in those words and he might understand that it's not about fairness, nor a "you get a friend I get a friend" kinda thing.|`|758cDKEFaa	i would choose my sister.<br>  i rather have my family with me than my partners.<br>  i wouldnt want my monster in law looking at my bits and we just dont get along at all!<br>  its your sister that has to go through this so its her choice who is with her.<br>  if i was in that situation i would tell my partner its me doing all the hard work to bring our baby into the world therefore its my choice and if you dont like it then i dont want you there, the hospital staff will kick out anyone the person in labour doesnt want there.|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	Your sister's partner is being selfish and needs to grow up. You should be there. If i had a sister, i'd want her there at the birth of my babies. Why isn't it possible for you both to be there? It's a shame your sister is being put in such an awful position as to have to choose between you, but the choice is hers, and i'm sure she'll put her foot down when it comes to it.|`|VEEbzc4jaa	I see what you mean. If you can both go in then great but my hospital only has 2 birthing partners so you might not be allowed 3 around the bed.<br>  <br>  Let ur sister and her partner handle it on there own. Im sure they will come to a decision nearer the time. <br>  <br>  It is a very personal thing giving birth to ur child. I dont want my hubbis mum in the room so ive decided to stop arguments only me and hubbi in the room. Then no ones upset. Thats probably what hes trying to achieve??|`|V7sfV5odaa	Yes, DON"T stress out your sister.  Time will take care of itself.  Give THEM time to decide who will be there and who won't be.  And...be honored than thankfull that you have a sister (and two little ones who love you)<br>  <br>  Don't forget... they will think YOU great for caring soooo... much about them.|`|xubIaiZaaa	my sister hands down. no way would i want my partners mother in the room while pushing out a baby, let alone two.<br>  <br>  i'd tell him if he wants his mum there so much then he can sit with her in the waiting rooms coz thats as far as she is going to get to me and my naked lower half!!|`|KPuDlWFiaa	Well its nive thats your sister wants you there with her, im havng my boyfriend and my mam there with me, but theres no way on this earth i would have my partners mother in the room while i gave birth, its a very very personal thing.|`|LQnKhiVMaa	u all the way, and if your sis was me,and me being as stubborn as i am , he wouldnt be going either...until he apologised, which he would do, if its that important to him, he'll be there, u wouldnt keep my partner from it x|`|9e8e40b3bc7a967d92070d264c4c53c0aa	i would have neither. actually i would have noone. as a matter of fact i would never want a little person shooting out of me. i am a very selfish person.|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Why can't you both be there? Plus anyway, it's her having the baby so her partner can quite frankly **** off or start respecting his partner's comfort!|`|412167FVaa	What your sister wants should prevail that is having you and having you present is what it should be.|`|IdoZbO39aa	Definitely my sister - not that i dont get along with my mother in law, i am just closer with my sister.|`|GjuRYsITaa	your the one giving birth so id say its entirely up to you|`|98WKYtfwaa	Your sister should tell her partner to p*ss off, it's upto her who she has in the room with her, if she doesn't feel comfortable with her MIL then she doesn't need to have her there. He's trying to make her feel guilty but he should respect her decision. I hate guys like that! <br>  <br>  I would NOT want my mother in law there at all, i hate her with a passion, i'd rather go alone than with her. I would want my partner & my close sister. If he has a problem with it i would tell him to try being scared sh*tless giving birth to a baby with people who you don't want there.|`|dd2vz570aa	Oh my God!  How selfish of her boyfriend and his mum.  Giving birth is a very personal and painful thing and I would not want my Mother in law in with me, how embarrassing.  She has a cheek just asking.  If I was your sister I would remind my partner that I am the one giving birth and going through all that pain and I will pick who I have with me and if he don't like it then he can stay at home with mummy while I'm in labour.  His mum should understand she wouldn't want her there instead of you.  Im 36 weeks now and really starting to get my labour planned.  My boyfriend is going to be there and maybe my big sister.  His mum and his family are not involved in anyway and if he didn't like it he don't have to come himself.  He aint even aloud to invite them up the hospital until I say so.  The way it should be.  Your sis has carried that baby for 9 months and given up every thing for it why should she give up her right of the labour she chooses?!|`|f84b2b45d58a6539dd190e931fdc5a32aa	Ok, Its entirely upto your sister who she wants in there with her, but she should try to avoid a huge argument cos it wont do her or the baby any good. She should sit her partner down and explain why she wants you there and wouldnt be comfortable with her mum in law there. Labours scary enough without feeling awkward and self concious cos theres someone there you dont want. <br>  Could your sister suggest to her partner that rather than be there for the birth, mother in law be at the hospital but wait till you've had baby and be a first visitor?<br>  Good luck and hope all goes well<br>  x|`|wE7lLCHSaa	I don't think it's about preference here, I think it's about rights.<br>  <br>  Yeah, much as it pains me to say this, my opinion is that the mother-in-law has more of a right to be there.  I think the father of the child has a right to invite his mother.  Mother trumps sister, regardless of whose mother and whose sister.<br>  <br>  But from what you wrote, it sounds like you could both be there, so what's the problem?|`|5XUnyNWGaa	he has no say in who is supposed to be in  there.. and your sister should put her foot down and tell him, so. I told my boyfriend I didn't want his parents even at the hospital (long story, his parents dont accept our daughter basically) Since it is her body, her giving birth, her the one who needs the support, it should be her decision. Not his.|`|no4tGa45aa	UGH your sister's MIL sounds like mine! LOL If your sister wants you to be at the birth then you should be at the birth. When your sister's partner carries a child for nine mths then has to push a child out of his privates THEN he can choose who is in there with him. (Gosh men are idiots.)|`|xhOulzZ7aa	Definately prefer the close sister to the mother in law. Your sister should have whoever she wants and feels comfortable with, it should not be totally decided by the father.|`|Q0UCgg3caa	She should tell him to go f*** himself and just have you in there. <br>  At least she has one caring and supportive person in her life.<br>  He has no right to say who goes into that room|`|15it6Zyqaa	your close sister|`|AA10698704	tell her that your sister will be there and to grow up.|`|3LGKs7SAaa	This woman sounds crazy! Seriously, what is wrong with wanting your sister there? Jeez, this woman could stand outside and come in afterwards, but a birth is all about the woman, and if another woman can't respect that, then she should not be allowed to be there. And as for her partner, he needs to let go of the apron strings a bit, because if his other half wants something in her current state, she should get it. His mum is nothing to do with the birth unless the two are good friends, because in that kind of situation, you should have friends and rellies around, not your partners mum!|`|oHmVGBCEaa	i chose my mum my partner was there too but he wasn't a great support what your sisters partner needs to remember is that it's your sister who is going to need the support and should respect her wishes my partner did suggest to me that if my mum didn't come in with me that his mum was happy to be there which wasn't an option since i don't feel that close to her and giving birth is when your at your most undignified and your mum in law just wouldn't see you like that so i guess i'd have to agree with you and that it should be you there|`|zCWFy3Nvaa	It really sucks to be in that type of predicament.I believe you should be there with your sister.Its very selfish of her husband to be acting so childish.So she carries her baby in her body for 9 months and also has to give birth but she can't chose who she wants present? That's real messed up.I had a similar problem but my hubby knew not to mess with me. I'm pretty sure if you end up in delivery room without him he will feel real stupid for making such a childish decision.Mother in laws are great and all but it's who you feel comfortable with.Giving birth isn't an easy process and having someone there like your sister for support is more then understanding.Her husband needs to back off because its not about what he wants and if he cant understand that then that's his problem.Is It possible his mother is pushing him to make this decision or is it just his bad judgment? Either way your sister is the boss and should definitely call the shots.

145RUNQHaa	All a three month old needs is breast milk and nothing else.keep feeding when she needs it and you'll build up a good supply.a breast fed baby is rarely constipated so see your doc about that.banana powder and sugar doesn't sound like a good idea.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This question is like 12 Really Bad Ideas rolled into one.<br>  <br>  Stop giving your baby that ridiculous concoction for starters.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	no milk, no sugar|`|C4miEeuYaa	Babies can't try cows milk until they are at least a year old. There are several reasons to delay the introduction of cow's milk until your baby reaches his first birthday. Most important, a baby's digestive system can't digest cow's milk proteins. Cow's milk also has too much sodium, potassium, and chloride, which can tax your baby's kidneys. Even if his system could handle it, cow's milk doesn't have all the vitamins and minerals (especially vitamin E, zinc, and iron) that he needs for growth and development in his first year. Giving a baby cow's milk could even cause iron deficiency and internal bleeding. And it can increase his risk of an allergic reaction.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also-it is not a good idea to give your baby sugar. There is plenty of natural sugars in the baby food fruits. The constipation may be coming from the banana paste. My daughter gets constipated when she eats bananas. Try giving your baby some baby food prunes, or a little bit of prune juice diluted with water. Good luck, and talk to your babies pediatrician!!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I don't know what banana powder is, but bananas generally can give a baby constipation.  At this age, she doesn't need anything but the breastmilk. And when she's ready for solids, which 4 months is earliest, you can give her plain veggies and fruits.  No sugar needed.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	Why are you giving banana powder at 3 months? Give water and breast milk. more than enough for 3 month old. And if you really feel like you should give more. try rice cereal.|`|LALfPKmSaa	Banana will clog things up. Rice cereal is a good idea, a better idea is to suplimate with baby formula. The constipation can be helped with a small bit of mineral oil. It's all natural, just call your doc and ask if it's all right to give her some.|`|qYNCV6L1aa	BABY IS MUCH TOO YOUNG FOR MILK AND SUGAR! That's why she's constipated. Her developing intestines can't handle that sort of food. At 3 months baby should still be on breast milk or formula only. Please consult with baby's doctor before giving baby milk and sugar. Milk isn't recommended until at least 1 year.|`|snzlHgqraa	i agree with everyone who says you shouldn't be giving your baby anything but milk right now.<br>  you can cause your baby to get allergies by introducing anything but milk too early.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	what the hell are you doing? no wonder shes constipated your giving her banana flavoured paste! if and i mean IF your baby is ready for solids which i doubt at three months although some do the only thing she should be getting is rice cereal very thin and breast milk...ug|`|6YwjNHJLaa	CEREAL IS NOT NECESSARY TILL SHE CAN DRINK A WHOLE 8OZ BOTTLE...AND DON'T GIVE BABY ANY KIND OF SUGAR!!!!

I've heard this same answer several times. A baby will not starve itself. It's just a phase that your son is going through. You should still keep an eye on what and how much he does eat. <br>   Just to be on the safe side, I'd consult with a pediatrician. Could never be too safe about our babies

So dont worry too much!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would give her more breast milk in the day rather that soy, juice and tea.|`|eWEqGHvJaa	With the other fluids she is taking in I would not be to worried.  If she was not drinking fluids as well as she is then I would be asking my Doctor about it.  With the soy milk and breast in the evening she might be getting more than you think.  If she were not on the breast and the other fluids then I would be worried. Keep an eye on her weight and if she drops weight or is other wise not healthy then you need to see the Doctor.  Babies don't always do what the doctor says they should.  They have a mind of their own and will be fine.  I hope this helps.  You sound like a good mother and enjoy your little girl.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	My periods were like clockwork prior to having Connor.  He had his 1st birthday yesterday, hasn't been breast fed since 7 months old, and I've had 4 periods since he was born.|`|723QHuicaa	Well,  are you assuming you will have a normal 28 day cycle?<br>  <br>  Perhaps your cycle length is different now, so your period isnt late, it just isnt due on yet.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My periods were like perfect clockwork pre-pregnancy. Afterwards they just went crazy though. I didn't have my period for a few months due to breastfeeding. Then when it finally came back it was all out of whack. It'd show up one month and not the next, be short, one time, and forever long the next. I was on about 5 different kinds of birth control over about a year before it finally went back to normal.|`|145RUNQHaa	My periods came back while i was breastfeeding about the same time as your has but they were about 5 weeks apart sometimes longer.it wasn't until i stopped breastfeeding they very slowly started to get closer together.i can pretty much predict the day now but it took forever to get back into a pattern.xx|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I'm breastfeeding and mine have been all out-of-whack.

However, my periods were pretty irregular after I stopped taking the pill and tried to get pregnant with my son...like 30, 45 and even 62 days apart!  I think most people are irregualr while they are still breastfeeding, and some don't get their period back until after the completely wean.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	I am still breast feeding.  I'd my first period about 7 months after giving birth.  And it was another six weeks until I had another one.  I used to be very predictable too but it seems the breast feeding throws your cycle off.  <br>  <br>  I don't think things completely go back to normal until you have completely finished breast feeding and even then it will take a few months for things to be completely regular again.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Its because you are breast feeding I didnt get my first period until a year later, she is 16 months now and I only got 2 and then I got pregnant. Its very normal to have irregular periods while you are breastfeeding.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	When breastfeeding, your cycle can be all over the place, if you get a period at all. You`re fine.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	maybe a week or 2|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I just went through the same thing. i got my first period back last month (I'm breastfeeding too) and I was a week late. I also ran to the store to buy a pregnancy test which was negative and got myself all worked up for nothing. Breastfeeding throws your cycle out of whack and it probably won't go back to being regular until you have weaned or cut way back on feedings. I had 21 day cycles like clockwork before my baby and this time I was over 30 days. Who knows if we are even ovulating. However, if you aren't ready for another one, you might want to look into more reliable birth control (an IUD maybe?) I know I for one could never rely on condoms...they just break way to easily for me :)
GoNk7UYsaa	My 23 month old had almost the same issue up until this past weekend. She started with having diarrhea and, like you, I gave her Pedialyte. Four days later, however, she still had the diarrhea, which I was getting ready to take her to the doctor for anyhow, but then she started vomiting, too. Considering that it was a Sunday night, I just took her to the ER because didn't feel safe waiting to get to her pediatrician Monday morning. Well, needless to say the ER doctor told me everything that I already knew and was doing -- give her Pedialyte, be sure to push fluids, and follow the BRAT diet (<a href="http://pediatrics.about.com/od/diarrhea/a/06_brat_diet.htm)." rel="nofollow">http://pediatrics.about.com/od/diarrhea/...</a> He said that as long as she's drinking and getting fluids she'll be fine. He said whatever virus is going around usually hits with vomiting or diarrhea or both combined and lasts around two weeks.<br>  <br>  Well sure enough...this was two weeks ago since she got this mess and 1 week since she went to the ER-- as of yesterday (Sunday)-- and she is just now getting better (besides one or two days where she did want to eat) and getting back to eating like normal. I think it's just the virus that just knocks their system out of order and it just takes them time to get back on track. If you really are concerned I would take your son to see his pediatrician just to be on the safe side.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	if he has no other symptoms other then not wanting to eat (and only drinking) it could be 1 of two things... he has a sore throat or he just doesn't want to eat. my daughter (also 19 months) will have times where she doesn't want to eat either but it's not because she is sick it's because she wants to control the situation (or at least that's what the pediatrician told me) ... however if your son is usually a good eater and just now is refusing food then i would lean more towards it being a sore throat issue. maybe you can call the pediatrician and see if there is anything to help soothe his throat ... or try ice pops (Popsicles)
G0s5uxrEaa	Kalia is very pretty! :)|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Kalia.<br>  100% prettier.|`|KKGt03xlaa	Alisha! Although, I don't know if its pronounced like Alicia. <br>  If not, I prefer Alicia better. However, I like Alisha better than Kalia<br>  What about something similar to Kalia - Kallie. I think Kallie is much more feminin sounding|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like Alisha best.  Its cute.  I also like Shelia or Sheelagh.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Love Kalia!<br>  <br>  Alisha is a little too over used for my tastes.|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	Kalia!!!!!|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Kalia|`|IEzkCljmaa	Kalia|`|Vaoe7KxVaa	Kalia =) <br>  <br>  very nice name|`|vTra7n5baa	Well, I'm glad she's unborn so she doesn't have to hear it.  Couldn't you name her something a bit more proper?
Jo2DfRzaaa	pool but it must come with pool help.  i just want to swim, i don't want to do all the up keep.<br>  they love running around outside.  we have a swing set and one of those step 2 climbing things w/a slide.  both the kids love the slide.  its what the boy loves to do, he makes a bee line for the slide as soon as we go outside.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i would buy one of those huge horribly expensive outdoor play gym things,.... you know the ones with a 'tree' house and slides, swings all the works. i would get it because it would be fun for the kids (and the whole family). at the moment i don't really have anything that is too much fun outside. my daughter is only 18 months and the only thing she has that she really likes is a power wheels truck that my MIL bought her that she can't even drive yet. it's still too cold to go outside and explore.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I big play yard..my kids would love it.. or else an inclosed, heated pool. My children all love to swim, i say enclosed and heated that way it would be in a little building that could be kept warm so we could swim in the winter time, and a door could be locked that way I wouldn't have them sneaking into the pool when i wasn't looking!|`|dDVAUA9saa	A  large, wooden outdoor climber with sandbox, swings, and things to climb on, etc.  <br>  <br>  Pool would be a close second.  since I live in Canada and only would get 5 months max out of a pool, I have to go with the climber.|`|veO1RXrCaa	A pool.  Alexander LOVES being in the water. He will be blue as a smurf from the cold and still would argue about getting out.  So a nice heated pool would be nice.  We have lots of shade in our current yard so the pool we had was always on the cool side.|`|5p7gpj36aa	a whole farm!  - - ok realistically .... a tree house with some "rock climbing" things to get up to it and a slide to get down.   (and a ladder too) and  pulley system to send up lunch!|`|AkFag8tNaa	The really nice wooden jungle gyms. We're out in the country and the nearest park is a ten minute drive.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	pool, cause I miss our pool|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	My children love,love, love being outdoors. My husband and I are also very fond of the outdoors. We take our children camping, off-roading on our UTV (Child care seats strapped in of course), hiking, swimming...all kinds of stuff. We spend all the time outside as possible, in the winter it is never warm enough to go outside, always under 15 degrees from November to April. We have a wooden swing set/play house in the back yard along with a huge sand box and they love it, I am glad we have it. I would really like to have a large kiddie pool with water geysers, a small water slide and dumping buckets like at the waterparks...but I am not so sure that is realistic living where we live, but it would be nice!|`|cnIzqEoDaa	If my kids were older, I would love to have a pool! They are too small right now, so it would just be a hazard. <br>  <br>  We do have a trampoline and they love it! We also play badminton in the summer, and our two oldest try to get involved. I think it will be more fun when they get older too though. They have a swing set, but they like the trampoline more.|`|AA12145826	I'm with s@hm....a pool with a pool boy would be nice....and a cabana....Oh wait, this is supposed to be for the kids right? Dangit! LoL<br>  <br>  We have one of those monstrosity of a jungle gym that a friend of our's gave to us with the little tree house, slide, monkey bars, swings, etc. So maybe I'd want to add a little "rock wall" to it, I don't know. Let me ask her....okay, Hannah wants a dog, does that count as "outdoor equipment"? What if we get a husky? LoL<br>  <br>  Oooh I know.....I think we'd all enjoy a slip-n-slide built into our little hill that I wouldn't have to clean up after every use. That would be cool!|`|nfzQkvqraa	I'm with say@home.  I'd like a big pool.  Just no work involved.  I think we have everything else possible.  My yard looks like a carnival in the summer most days.  My kids favorite outside toy is our bouncer.  We have 2 of them now and they love inflating them and jumping. I think they're safer than a trampoline so I like them too.  (and I like to get in and bounce as well.)|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Probably a race track for their bikes.<br>  <br>  They love their push bikes, and their 4wheeler.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Swimming pool. Any local park has anything else you'd need.|`|SO6tHlKcaa	swing set with clubhouse|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	A tree house!!  We have a tiny yard w/ tiny trees.... maybe one day!<br>  My dad built us a tree house when we were kids, it was the BEST!!<br>  <br>  My parents (who live 20 minutes away) have an in-ground pool, trampoline, horseshoe pit, basketball goal, baseball field, etc, etc so we visit them a LOT- especially in the summer.  I really want a bigger yard for my boys though.  Right now we don't have much room for anything more than a blow up pool and sandbox.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i'd love to build a treehouse with the kids.  the most popular piece of outdoor equipment in our yard right now is the trees.  <br>  <br>  our kids love our swingset (slide/swings/monkey bars/sandbox:  excellent investment ... very expensive, but if you prorate it over the hours of use it's gotten in the last 8 years, it comes out dirt cheap).  and their bikes and scooters.  and sleds.  when they were little (through about age 5), they really loved the stomp rockets.  the soccer ball and soccer nets.  they also love the kid-sized rakes and shovels, which they use to make mazes in the leaves or snow.<br>  <br>  would not want a pool or trampoline.  too much safety stress.  anyway, we live very near a pool and the neighbors have a trampoline.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The play set and until this winter the sandbox( has a cover) get the most use. As soon as it warms up the pool will be used almost daily. The things like the volley ball and crochet only get used a few times each year. The thing that really gets used a lot is balls. kick ball, ball tag, basket ball, or just playing catch.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I would get my kids their own sand box.  Not these cheap ones you get at Walmart.... the ones you make out of rail road ties and are HUGE.  <br>  <br>  So far it's really our toddler that uses toys outdoors and he really loves his Big Wheel that he got for Christmas :-)|`|EtCRnDJMaa	we have a swing set with club house & rope.  They can exchange the swings for rings or the bar.  We also have a trampoline that we bought from Sam's.  They have a sand box which they LOVE!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Pool!! I grew up with one, it was great! I am such a strong swimmer because we had a pool available 24/7. Pool parties are fun too :)
R5fe3CPPaa	I am so glad that I came across your question. I too had the same pain on Saturday afternoon 8DPO it was nothing I have experienced before. It was cramping in my lower abdomen and in my lower back. Now I am just getiing little cramps every now and them AF not due until the 3rd. Baby dust to you!!!|`|VMASMHX6aa	Sounds very promising! Implantation can be painful and it's right on cue time-wise.<br>  <br>  You should get a positive within a few days it if was implantation. Don't test tomorrow as it will be too early I think.<br>  <br>  I am also 10dpo. Fertilityfriend is saying I am 11dpo but looking back at my last few cycles and when I've ovulated relative to positive OPKs, I think I am only 10. <br>  So we are the same! Fingers crossed for us both!|`|xpstigPTaa	It sounds VERY promising hun!!!! The exact same thing happened to me except mine lasted for about a half hour. It was so bad that I was crying and then a week or so later I found out I am pregnant! I wish you the best of luck and truck loads of baby dust!!!!!! I have my fingers crossed!!!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hmmmm........it sounds like imlantation!!! cuz if it was a cyst or something the pain would have been a lot higher than the pubic region. If ur 10 DPO and had implantation pain it may have been ur uterus giving a good stretch!!!! Ohh man what day are u going to test?!?!?! I am soooOOOoOOooo nervous and excited!!! keep me posted!!!!!|`|mq9IXpv8aa	Well, my only other suggestion would be that it could have been either a cyst rupturing or just having pressure on it. <br>  I have PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome) which basically means I have a lot of things wrong with my insulin, testostrone levels, and cysts on my ovaries. This disease can also cause problems getting pregnant- so I would ask how long you have been trying to conceive? And if its been a while coupled with this pain you may want to get checked out. <br>  <br>  Also, did you have any hot flashes, was the pain a cramping that you could still move around or a pain were you were doubled over unable to physically move? <br>  If not, it very well could have been the embryo attaching- let's hope it was this! :)|`|ETM57dBAaa	I sure hope so you are such a kind person and deserve this!!  I am currently dealin with AF!  No fun!!!  You are always in my prayers!  XOXO|`|5axGfFofaa	Hopefully it was implantation...it sounds promising!
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think that, as a parent, I've become even more liberal in my feelings about criminal justice - become even more aware of the fact that every criminal is someone's child, someone who was little once and who never got the right guidance to learn how to confidently make good choices in their life.  <br>  <br>  I feel the same about juvenile justice system - only, maybe, more hopeful that the kids can, possibly, be turned around.  <br>  <br>  My experience with reactive attachment disorder, in a niece who lived with us, though - has made me realize how hard it can be to change the paths that some people get on, once they're on it - paths of manipulation, deception, emotional survival at all costs.  Which, also, makes me realize how important it is to make those trust connections & teach those value lessons from day one.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Yes... I just got a message last night from an old college roommate that a girl we use to hang out with was shot to death by her 11 year old soon to be step son! She was also 8 months pregnant. <br>  I don't honestly know what to think of this part of it all... They are charging the child as an adult. <br>  I don't support the death penalty, i use to before i had kids, but now i think that maybe it's wrong to put people to death for several reasons.. some *(few) may be innocent, others have parents, children and so on that would also suffer a loss the same as a victims family did..|`|723QHuicaa	I do not support capital punishment or vigilante justice. There are too many variants that could cause the accused party irreversable harm, later to be found out to be innocent.<br>  <br>  However...<br>  If there was 200% accurate evidence to support that the person was guilty - then yes, most definately. I read a story about a 20-something male who raped a FIVE MONTH old baby. The child had to have major reconstructive surgery. A blood soaked towel and blood soaked baby wipes were found in this guys appt. That mutherfucker should hang for what he done. It makes me nauseous even typing this. If it was my child and the justice system failed her (which it does all too often in the UK), I wont desciribe what I'd do, but have you ever seen the movie ''Hard Candy''?|`|j2mRop0laa	I do not support the death penalty. I think people that are truly guilty should rot in prison and those that aren't should have the chance to eventually be set free.<br>  Having children has made me question my views because of child molesters. I often wonder why they are given such a light sentence, when to me- it's the worst crime. <br>  I think children under the age of 13 need HELP, not harsh punishment. I think they need love, counseling and a CHANCE. Something I think they must not have gotten to get to the point of committing crimes. <br>  There has to be a better way.|`|AA12145826	I think my views on both the adult and juvenile penal system have remained the same, it has its flaws but fundamentally its still sound. I'm still for capital punishment in cases of murder, kidnapping & rape. I also think that the victim or family of the victim should have some weight in the sentence that is carried out within the letter of the law.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if becoming a parent has impacted my views on them at all. I suppose my answer would change should it be my child involved (on either side of the law), but for right now I still hold true to my original beliefs.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	i have always thought that the death penalty should be brought into action where i live. criminals get away too easily, and even when they get "life" they get 3 meals a day, TVs etc etc. look at Ian Huntley who murdered the 2 schoolgirls. he has to be watched round the clock in case he commits suicide, or the other prisoner attack him! throw him to the wolves.<br>  <br>  <br>  if anyone ever hurt my child, i would end up in jail. criminals should be punished appropriately. do to them, what they do to others.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	My views are the same; I've always supported the death penalty... I'm tired of slaps on the wrist, for major crimes.<br>  <br>  (I wish people would give a warning, before posting disturbing things about babies or children. I wouldn't have clicked on this, if I'd known I'd end up reading something so horrible.)|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I still feel the same way. I was for the death penalty before...I'm for it now. So no becoming a parent hasn't changed my views.  I was already set and comfortable with my beliefs and adding to my family hasn't changed my mind on any of it.|`|M2yERqNSaa	my views have gotten stronger, they dont use the chair often enough and kids get nothing but a slap on the wrist these days<br>  <br>  my kids know if they intentionally kill someone, i love them but I severe all ties with them PERIOD since I taught them right from wrong|`|cAtWxJG1aa	never did, never will support the death penalty.  society should not be in the business of murder.  how well do we do with, say, paving roads? enough said.  <br>  <br>  i always thought there should be separate systems for adult and juvenile justice, and being a parent and experiencing the way kids think has just reinforced that.<br>  <br>  good question.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I'm kind of on the fence about capital punishment.  On the one hand, there are cases where I see death by lethal injection as perfectly acceptable.  Other cases, I feel differently.  A life long punishment of life in jail seems to be enough to torture anyone's soul of their crimes.  But to some people, life in jail makes no difference to them.  <br>  <br>  And not all of these criminals murder or commit evil acts because they didn't get the "right guidance" in life or they have a "detachment disorder".  I'm so tired of people trying to make excuses for them!!!  I know of many cases where the criminals came from very loving homes with very good guidance but they still choose the wrong path.  I do understand this person is someone's child, someone's family member.  I'm sorry but if your child did the crime, then they must face the appropriate consequences.  I would hate to see my son on death row because he killed someone.  As hard as I would want to defend him, I cannot defend what he did.<br>  <br>  I will say this, if anyone ever dared to lay a hand on my children in any way I deem inappropriate, I would be liable to kill them myself (and accept the consequences).<br>  <br>  I don't understand those who argue lethal injection as "cruel and unusual punishment".  What about the cruel and unusual deaths they murder their victims by?  So these people are telling me that if a man cuts out your 5 year old daughter's heart out of cold blood he's supposed to be treated as a valuable member to society?  I think not!  <br>  <br>  Another thing I can't understand is people who say that we should not determine who lives and who dies.  I can apply that to lives that are just beginning (as in the pro-life/pro-choice case).  But to a person who makes the willful, knowledgeable decision to kill/rape someone has chosen their own fate.  An unborn baby is an innocent life.  They have not murdered someone or raped someone.  Criminals give up their right to live as soon as they commit a murder or sexual assault.<br>  <br>  As for the juvenile system, well I haven't had an encounter with them yet and I hope I never do.  I will say this:  Too often kids get a slap on the wrist because "they are kids!".  Well if someone doesn't wake them up to their reality of their actions, they just might end up on death row one day because the system (or their parents) didn't bother to set them straight.  <br>  <br>  That being said, I think yes being a parent does impact your views on those matters.  If someone raped or murdered my child, I would want the proper punishment for that crime.  If my child committed a crime (again I hope it never happens) I would want the system to handle it appropriately.
AA11920812	Okay, I am so doing Maureen`s idea for a pea-pod tee-pee. That sounds like so much fun! Actually, I haven`t gardened since we moved to our new house (about five years ago). Before that our yard was small and the best spot was good for a tomato patch - but boy did we have the best tomatoes ever!!<br>  <br>  My grandpa had a massive garden with heirloom tomatoes. And, my mom managed a huge garden while growing up. She even canned everything for the winter. Boy, I wish I was that ambitious. <br>  <br>  AND, yes my kids love it. My youngest so much so that we have to watch him like a hawk at the mall. He likes to *garden* with the live plants and planter boxes. Especially, near the middle of the mall where the kids play area is...tons of planter boxes he likes to *weed*. LOL. <br>  <br>  You reminded me I need to order my seeds. If anyone is an avid tomato grower check out tomato bob`s!! He has the best seeds on heirloom varieties (the kind that are meaty and have thin skin, not genetically modified).<br>  <a href="http://www.tomatobob.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tomatobob.com/</a>|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	My kids always enjoy helping  the grandparents with stuff (we live in an apt so we can't exactly do any of that!) When I was little though we had 3 large gardens and an orchard. I loved getting out there and planting stuff. And the food tasted so much better when you could just go out and get what you wanted for that meal. I was sad when my parents stopped doing it. (my older siblings didn't like to do the work..they just wanted to enjoy mine and my parents work!)<br>  I think it's great that you are doing that with your kids. Some of my fondest memories are from gardening with my mom. <br>  Word of caution though....we found this out the hard way...make sure that you use salt when preparing stuff if that's your main source of veggies. My family doesn't like salting food and I got really ill b/c of not having a high enough salt intake.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	We don't grow fruit or veggies, but we do have plants and flowers (yes, I actually managed to make them live for more than a year!) and my 3yo an 5yo boys LOVE helping in the garden. They have a bunch of cool, little cactus's that are just theirs, and they take it all very seriously lol. <br>  My favourite gardening quote from Nicco is when he was watering a pot plant with a picture of a frog on it, and he spun around and said "Mom! Does this plant grow frogs?!" =)|`|oIyXMnmcaa	My kids love to garden each summer for the past couple years now and they love it as much as I do. I think its great cause they are learning how things grow and how to take care of them--as well as the time we get together outside during those warm sunny days is priceless, I love it and look forward to getting dirty each spring.<br>  <br>  Here are jasper's sunflowers from last summer:<br>  <a href="http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/belle_butterfly/?action=view¤t=IMG_1963.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/b...</a><br>  <br>  Here are Mya's moonflowers: they only open at night and die by the time the sun comes up.<br>  <a href="http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/belle_butterfly/?action=view¤t=IMG_1883.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/b...</a><br>  <br>  And here is our first veggie garden...Mya planted the cumcumbers and Jasper helped plant the peppers. <br>  <a href="http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/belle_butterfly/?action=view&current=IMG_1884.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j142/b...</a>|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Last year my Play Group actually did a lot of Gardening activities.

I touch plants and they die. It's a real tragedy.|`|AA12145826	She really loves to garden up until she actually has to stop playing around and help pull out weeds or till....then its no more fun.

We lost a plum tree in a wind storm last fall, so we're going to have to replace that first thing this spring.  My son loved that tree for some reason... <br>  <br>  If you've got little ones, throw together a tee-pee, made of long bamboo poles (I got a big bunch of them at Home Depot years ago for $10), tied together at the top with string, then covered with vining peapods and beans.  When my kids were little, they loved sitting in there and snacking on their house!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	should I just go ahead and give everybody a thumbs down or say my girls hate to garden!  Is this opposite day?<br>  <br>  My girls LOVE to plant anything! they love to plant the seeds from their apples too.  They really love flowers and then they also enjoy picking them.  Pumpkins are great too!|`|j2mRop0laa	My kids love to help their grandparents garden. Really, I'm not much of a gardener. I'm terrified I might run into a worm or something else gooey. lol<br>  My youngest will be planting flowers with her group next week (you know..the group I run). I have to go shopping for little pots and flower seeds etc soon. They are so excited.

I'll put pics up on facebook for those of you that have mine!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	When young my son liked to help now he can't stand it.

rlMbcfpXaa	Good morning! I have the exact same issue!  Every time I go the OB, it is sky high!  Almost every visit, they have me lay on my left side for ten minutes and retake it.  When they do, it goes back to normal.  <br>  <br>  So that I can keep a close check on it, I have bought a blood pressure monitor and I take my blood pressure twice a day. I have kept a log to make sure that there isn't a trend upward and I have actually taken that log to the doctor to show him my readings. They always read fine at home.<br>  <br>   Being anal like I am, I took my blood pressure monitor to an area clinic and had them take my blood pressure manually. I was able to compare my purchased monitor to make sure that it was giving legitimate readings.<br>  <br>  I am sure that the next time it reads high, they will probably have you lay on your left side and retake it.  White coat syndrome is VERY real!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|l0YvaYTDaa	You can check your own bloodpressure at most drugstores.  If you do this a couple of times each week at about the same time each day it might give you some indication whether or not it's consistently high (i.e. try to eliminate the possibility of "white coat syndrome")<br>  <br>  My ob/gyn always checked for high blood pressure and I'm sure would have treated it if necessary.  I had high blood pressure before becoming pregnant (on meds), it was perfect during the pregnancy (off meds), and now it's back up again (back on meds).<br>  <br>  It's important that you keep an eye on it as well.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	ew.. keep and eye on it . and make sure they check for protein preeclampsia is very unpleasant (i had it). i would suggest taking it easy for the next little while|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i would get it checked regularly as that and protein in your urine could be pre-eclampsia which needs treatment asap. see your gp!|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Your OB/GYN will treat it. Usually high blood pressure in pregnancy is a symptom of pre-eclampsia. You will have to be monitored. They might give you blood pressure medication but most doctors don't since many of them are unsafe in pregnancy. Have them check your protein levels and watch out for any abnormal swelling and flashing lights in front of your eyes and dizziness.<br>  <br>  ETA: I was diagnoised with pre -eclampsia when I was about 36 weeks. They monitored me until I was 38 weeks and then decided to induce me because it was way to high and was putting both my health and my sons health at risk. It was about 159/112 when I was induced.
sIr2fWh6aa	yes, a higher miscarriage rate.  I wouldn't recommend riding any sort of ride being pregnant.  Unless you did before you knew you were pregnant...|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	No effect whatsoever, because you can't ride them.

I mean, really.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Oh my god, I rode that roller coaster ride at New York New York in Vegas, and I was 12 weeks pregnant!! But I didn't know at that time. Luckily, my baby boy turned out healthy in the end!<br>  <br>  Yes, you can get a miscarriage riding a roller coaster.|`|SnanuNKiaa	SCRAMBLED EGGS!!! sorry bad joke. Yes it carries a risk of miscarriage, since they warn you about it before you get on the ride, but you can't blame yourself if you didn't know.|`|hmOidFp3aa	YES! I have only been to lagoon ( a theme park in utah) and they say if you are pregnant not to ride any rollercoasters! I could only imagine that 6 flags would be just the same!
gNK8clF8aa	Certainly a possibility when you think in terms or reincarnation. <br>  <br>  It is often mentioned in Buddhism that some people find it easy to learn specific things or have very specific preferences in life from a very early age onwards, and these things could well be caused by habits in the mind which continues from life to life.<br>   I have never heard a specific comment about gender related to these habits. But to put it simple; if I would die today, I can certainly imagine that I have a weird feeling if I would happen to find myself in a female body! It may even be (part of) the reason for homosexuality, but I couldn't tell, really.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	We'll never know.  Interesting question :)|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Possibly. I think that explains it as well as anything else for the most part.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I suppose it's possible, if you believe in reincarnation.
p33BChZ4aa	There could be a number of reasons for nausea and tiredness. Your body clock could be adjusting to the seasons, you could be stressed, it could be anything. <br>  <br>  As for the bleeding, is it regular and/or is it fresh? You could also be confusing this with blood from your anus. This is normal and nothing to worry about if it is fresh and bright red. <br>  <br>  It would help to go to a doctor to explain your symptoms and surely put your mind at ease :)|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I suggest going to see a doctor for a blood test.|`|eFB2jLVbaa	if you took the 3 weeks ago you can take another one now|`|JjXFj2EBaa	People on here cannot give you the answer, the only thing that can tell you if you are pregnant is a test.   There are tests available that can tell from five days before your period is due.  It is easy to get a false negative early on because the level of hormones might not be high enough yet|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	make an appointment with the doctor and get a professional opinion. people on here wont give you the answer your after.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Go to your doctor and get a blood test done.|`|sstNdyYVaa	go and see the doctors and get a pregnancy test done!<br>  <br>  all the best|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	you could be but i would wait utill you were a week late.. <br>  i knew i was pregnant but didnt get a positive untill 6 days late. and had no spotting at all.

I think sometimes it can take up to two days but I know when I had mine my doctor rushed the results to be nice and I found out in two hours.|`|F8EMQzxfaa	Once I thought I was pregant sadly I wasnt.:[ But it took them 2days to get mine.
s4LWmcTjaa	It's none of your business for one.  You are not the parent.  <br>  <br>  Second, you are right.  You are NOT a doctor, so unless you have M.D. next to your name you can't properly diagnose your brother with ADHD.<br>  <br>  So your brother annoys you.  That's life with a little brother (I would know, I have a little brother and he was quite irritating at times).  It doesn't mean he has a disorder.  <br>  <br>  Your brother probably just wants attention.  ADHD goes so far beyond just jumping around and making noise.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	She's his Mum...she knows best...she wont take him because she doesn't want him labelled...that would go on his record for life! Chill out and make sure he isn't eating a lot of sugar or additives.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	if you are living in the same home of course it would effect you. maybe your mom really doesn't think anything is wrong with him or maybe she realizes that something is wrong and she is either to afraid to find out or she doesn't believe that putting him on a bunch of medication is a good thing. no one here can really tell you why your mom won't take him to get checked out.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Well as a mom, she's probably concerned about the popular overdiagnosing that is prevalent now. She may be in denial. He may just need some behavior modification, she's afraid that he'll need to be medicated etc...|`|uhRKCb9kaa	why do't you yourself take initiative and take him to doctor, you are his elder sis|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	You don't need to be a doctor to think that some one has something wrong with them, you need to be one to make an official diagnosis though. <br>  <br>  See if you can make an appointment and take him yourself, or another adult family member that will be willing to do it, The NHS is free, for under 18s at least.<br>  <br>  You're his sister you care about him just as much as your parents, so you have just as much rights to be concerned and he affects your life just as much so again you have just as much right to be cincerned for him.<br>  <br>  The reason people are having ago at you is because you have a different point of view than your parents and that goes against their primitive alpha-male ape-like attitude.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	SHe may not feel it is neccessary.<br>  Some parents do not like the idea of their child needing medicine or having something wrong with them.<br>  With that being said, there are children who are not diagnosed or are and do not get medicine, some prefer it that way.<br>  It is a different way of living that's all.<br>  Maybe if you wanted to, you could in a passive aggressive way inform her. You could print out some of the symptoms you think your brother has and you could print out way for treating, and then let her read them.<br>  She may appreciate that approach more and she could take it from there.<br>  If she feels there is a reason to have it further looked into then fine, if not then you need to let it be.<br>  Many boys are very hyper and they have no disorder.|`|2c10ae9d03edf5d663e295c5fc61a2caaa	How old is he?Could you possibly go with him,i think your mom is wrong for not taking him at least to be sure he does not have it....Maybe if another adult suggest she would think about it good luck i hope she takes him in it would help him if he does have it|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	just because hes hyper doesn't mean he has it. is he forgetful? impatient? kinda outta it? has a hard time listening?

h5X0Rjjyaa	all babies develop at their own pace.  It is a good sign that you have a fetal pole and sac.  You may have ovulated later than you thought or the baby is just growing slower than most.  I would not be suprised if you go on to deliver a healthy baby!  Good luck!|`|3h72pELYaa	Its possible that when you got your first positive hpt that you were only 3 weeks pregnant, plus margin of error on ultrasound dating in early pregnancy is about 5 days, so we can almost make the time match up.  There's not much you can do though other than wait and see what happens.  Definitely not ectopic though, and if you saw a fetal pole that its not a blighted ovum either.<br>  Good luck.
wl7tlYOYaa	You dont count how long your cycle is just 1 month you have to count at least 3 and that will give you a more accurate number...if you have a 30 day cycle (like me) then usually ovulate about 16-17 days after the first day of your period instead of the 14 days on a regular 28 day cycle. If you need help theres alot of free websites out there to help you out with this just use google! Baby dust to you|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. You should really see an OBGYN and let them help you get your BBT charts and stuff. You can do it yourself but sometimes theres a lot of questions and the drs would be able to answer them for you! But BBT is basal body temping. Its a certain type of thermometer and you take it at the same time every day before you get out of bed and put it in a chart. You will see a pattern but your dr can analyze it for you and help you pinpoint when you ovualte and how long your luteal phase is! GOOD LUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  OHH and also OPK's (ovulation predictor kits) they work like a pregnancy test but detect LH (lutenizing hormone) which is the surger prior to ovulation! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|cnIzqEoDaa	You might want to try an ovulation predictor kit. They are more accurate than the calendars.
rC6gL7KOaa	Yes you are. My doctor actually advised me to begin trying immediately because I would be more fertile. My husband and I did, and I got pregnant 2 weeks later. I was only 6 weeks at the time of the m/c though.|`|XTf9VaLoaa	wen i lost my baby my gp told me to wait at least 1 month b4 tryin as my body might not be stable enough to go full term with a baby straight away but i did loose my baby very very late on in the pregnancy
955YoHvVaa	My daughter never really took to those sippy cups but when she was about 10 months old we started giving her those dixie cups with water and apple juice to drink from and she does well with those..also maybe try one of those cups with a straw my daughter took those aswell.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Around 6 months we offered Jana water in a sippy cup (with handles). She knew just what to do and started drinking from it right away. It helped though that she had practiced using a sippy cup by stealing her older brother's cups and started drinking from them when he set them down within her reach :)|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	My son drank full strength juice at 2 weeks old (for constipation - under the doctors advice).  We gave him 2 ounces a day for the longest time, as if we missed even one day he wouldn't poop for a week!  Water, he took the first time we offered him a couple ounces, around 9 months old.  He had been drinking out of cups since he was 4 months old with his meals.  <br>  <br>  My daughter on the other hand, never drank anything other than formula until she was 18 months old.  Then she started taking milk, and about a month later some juice and some water.  At 19 months was when she first drank out of a cup too.  I wouldn't worry about it.  I have seen the two very opposite ends of the "normal" range!  Just keep offering it to her, and one day she will decide she likes it!|`|ddP3klT3aa	My son has always had water. When he got the hiccups as a newborn I have him a little water. When he eats solids I give him a little water. I don't give him a ton..but its not going to hurt. When he was crying for no reason and I couldn't soothe him I gave him water.|`|yea2hci5aa	I started giving my daughter water at roughly 9-10 months of age.  I did give her organic all natural juice earlier due to the fact that she had problems with constipation and the doctor recommended prune juice but I thought that was too strong so I gave her apple juice, non-diluted.  I tried giving my daughter the juice diluted but she HATED it.<br>  <br>  My daughter really likes the born free trainer cups and also the really cheap take and toss cups.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I started giving my Daughter diluted Juice at around 7 months. She never would just drink plain water- It had to have taste! :) Also, my Daughter never took a regular sippy cup well, but she did take a straw sippy cup very well! You should try a sraw sippy cup. That way, you dont have to make another transition when she goes to drink out of a cup.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Brody loves water. He's been drinking water since he started self feeding, I'd say 6 months and up. It started as only sips from a bottle with water, but now I give him his sippy with water, and if he wakes up at night during sleep time I will give him water. But he likes it and takes it with no problem.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	We have started little sips at 6 months. He doesn't do much more with his sippy cup besides bang it on his high chair. I do his sippy cup with the lid off during his lunch/dinner and he takes a little.|`|SDjrojZXaa	my son is 9 months as well and he isnt interested either however i have found that the nuby cup does work better than the nuk. I asked my doctor about this though and he said to just keep offering. The only thing he does like the most though is gerber banana yogurt drink and i dilute it.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	My daughter is ten months old, and even though she has a sippy cup, which she mostly holds upside down to chew on its bottom, she prefers drinking out of my glasses. Drinking out of mommy's glass is a bit more messy, but that helped to get my daughter interested in drinking. I hold the glass for her.
EtCRnDJMaa	He should be locked up for the rest of his life.  <br>  <br>  At 11 you know right from wrong.   He knew what he was doing...know doubt about that at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh good one peanut!  now you're going to blame the gun.  Guns don't kill people, people kill people!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I have experience working with rehabilitation with young violent offenders in the detention center and residential treatment centers.<br>  <br>  yes he should be tried as an adult.  I agree an 11 year old cannot have the judgement that an adult has because the frontal lobe remains immature into the early twenties, however at 11 you understand death is permanent, this was premeditated, he was a hunter so he understood how guns work, and about death.  He purposely took the lives of 2, and for that, tried as a juvenile he would be released at 18, no that is not enough time.  He should be housed in a juvenile facility till 18 and then transferred.  I don't think life without parole is absolutely necessary but a life sentence for each death is what 20 years and for good behavior out in 35 years making him 46, that seems reasonable to me.<br>  <br>  These kids are not rehabilitated.  They are violent, and nearly 100 percent likely to reoffend.  They become institutionalized and don't survive in society.  They have antisocial behaviors, are labeled oppositional defiant disorder, explosive disorder, impulse control disorder.<br>  <br>  I have seen time and time again for a young child to commit murder get out, and be back in for another violent crime within months of getting out.<br>  <br>  peanut you are missing the issue, a person who isn't severely emotionally disturbed would not touch a gun at 11 and point it at family members and shoot.  Especially one with experience hunting so he knew how to use a gun and about death.  The point is for people who are severely emotionally disturbed you can't proof the house for them to be safe, they will put the newborn in the dryer and kill him (actual case), put the dog in the microwave and kill him (actual case), stab mom while she is in bed with a kitchen knife (a three year old), mom lived needed hundreds of stitches, bury the sister alive and not tell anybody (she died actual case), drown the twin brother (actual case) these are all kids between the ages of 8 and 13.  Light the parents bed on fire, killed 4, a 14 year old boy<br>  <br>  desmeran have you been to juvie?  The pods are 20 cells each, with a maximum of 40 inmates, they are so overcrowded 3 to a pod, they can't see the psych unless they make a serious suicidal attempt, to get to the nurse they have to be extremely sick bordering on needing hospitalization, many are psychotic, not on meds, bipolar, not med compliant, if you attempt suicide you are stripped naked and put on a 23 hour lockdown in a cell made for 1 with 3 people in it 8x5 only 1 cot.  Its horrendous.  There is no rehab happening here<br>  <br>  I do agree that you are increasing the odds of a child using a gun if its in your home and not properly locked up.  Sociopathic tendencies symptoms are exhibited very very early on.  It does not seem that this is a crime of passion (heat of the moment), or self defense, it was premeditated, planned, and surely this disturbed child has shown symptoms of being so before now that were largely ignored, as is too often the case.<br>  <br>  ETA desmeran its a great idea but so unrealistic the funding for these facilities isn't there at all, they are already stretched where is it going to come from?|`|VwMkiLFPaa	11 years old is quite young! Yes, he committed a serious crime but WHY? I think instead of sending this boy to jail, someone needs to find out the truth behind all of it. An 11 yr old doesn’t just kill to kill. Something more was going on, something set this boy off, or something has been causing him to act this way because it’s just not normal. <br>  <br>  I’m not saying all kids that do acts like this can be “cured” so to speak. But I do think we should give them a chance to find out!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Yes|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No, I don't think he should be tried as an adult because that could mean that he could face a lifetime sentence and it would be wrong to take that boy's life away for a mistake. I'm sure he understood what he was doing so he certainly deserves to be punished. However, he's young enough to rehabilitate and I think that if its possible to do, that he should have a chance at it. <br>  <br>  He needs psychological counseling. Whomever gave him a gun is partially at fault, too. It's not like that boy used someone else's gun. The article said that it was his gun. Who in their right mind would give a child his age a gun? I don't know much about hunting but I read that usually, hunting rifles were used not shotguns.|`|AA12145826	Wow.....<br>  <br>  On one hand, he committed a very adult crime in a very adult manner using a very adult weapon with very adult intentions.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, he's a child. He's impulsive, selfish, and immature. Its how his brain works.<br>  <br>  He should be locked up in a juvenile detention center until he is 18 and then he should be transferred to an adult prison for the rest of his life. Would that be trying him as an adult? Possibly.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i read about that this weekend.  i don't know what the answer is.  there has to be something wrong w/that little boy to do what he did.  there has to be.  i can't believe that a child would just up and shoot someone just because.  the womans poor daughter found her, she was 5.  how sad all the way around.<br>  i don't know that i could view an 11 year old as an adult.  the kid needs some help...|`|LNnRSLdtaa	yes<br>  <br>  my 11 year old sister knows full well when shes doing something wrong<br>  <br>  but i think the more important question with this case is should guns be so avalible in america?<br>  people dont have guns in there houses in england so things like this very rarely happen <br>  we manage to fight off burgulars just fine<br>  <br>  but if a mother and baby being shot by an 11 year old is not enough to convince people guns should not be in households i dont know what will<br>  <br>  <br>  katie- so you think that if that gun was not around the 11 year old would have been able to stab the woman to death?<br>  the gun is the reason that boy was able to kill her <br>  anyother way where close contact is needed the woman would have over powered him so yeah im going to put some blame on the gun<br>  <br>  yes the boy pulled it but if the gun wasnt there he would of had a much harder time killing her|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	No, children are not adults and shouldn't be treated like them, adults are always saying this and always saying they want children to have different laws (age restrictions etc) this rule doesn't just go away in certain situations because you're angry and want revenge.|`|baW9u4yLaa	Maybe it's a case for post-natal abortion...|`|2pAexfOMaa	no 11 year old should ever be treated or tried as an adult ever!|`|rNvXWMOMaa	yes, an 11yr old knows better.|`|KSUPtqCaaa	This is a remarkably difficult question to answer; and I'm not sure there is a correct answer available...<br>  <br>  The issue at hand is that an 11 year old child allegedly committed a premeditated murder, continued the day as though nothing happened, and then lied about it to cover the truth. This shows a level of sophistication not typical of an elementary aged child; but more important, it shows malice and forethought to carry this out.<br>  <br>  I have no answer as to whether he should be tried as an adult or a child; but I think in general the answer should be children should be tried as children, when necessary. What I mean by this is we need a better yardstick to measure the maturity of those involved in such crimes, not a blanket black-and-white law to categorize offenders.|`|H0fXySX9aa	he should be tried for murder yes as an adult im not sure<br>  he certainly deserves locking up for life for what he did<br>  he attacked some one while asleep<br>  he knew what he was doing and should pay the price of life|`|gb4beCZTaa	im 11 and i know murder is wrong so i would go to jail if i did.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	Wow...that's awful.  I would day no, but I guess it would depend on the kids and the circumstances.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Yes at 11 one understands that killing is wrong|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	No I do not.  I suppose some people think he should be on death row.  11 year olds are not able to process things in the same way adults can.  They are also not able to predict the consequences of their actions as clearly as adults.  I do think that he needs some serious help and I hope he gets it.  Apparently he shot her with his own gun?????  Yet another reason why the US should have stricter gun laws and people who allow an 11 year old to operate a gun need their heads examined.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	No.  The whole reason we have separate penalty systems for adults and children is that an 11-year-old doesn't have the same ability to regulate his actions and understanding of consequences as an adult does.  We wouldn't leave an 11-year-old unattended for long periods of time because we know they're not up for it.  They don't suddenly become "up for it" just because they've done something particularly awful.  It makes no sense to me at all to have a separate juvenile system but then just abandon it for serious crimes when the adults are particularly eager for revenge. <br>  <br>  Besides, don't we think that virtually any 11-year-old is still young enough that rehabilitation is a real option? Let's figure out penalties in the juvenile justice system that make sense for serious crimes, but combine them with some help for such kids, and certainly don't be even considering giving an 11-year-old either the death penalty or life in prison.<br>  <br>  <br>  beetle -- so how about if we fix that instead of changing the system to pretend kids are adults?
G1ZgTqNcaa	I had taken prometrium one month while on clomid.  The Dr. told me to take it so it would create a good lining in the uterus for the eggs to stick to when I ovulated on the clomid.  That was the second month I used clomid.  It did create a good lining, but I did not get pregnant that month.  The following month, my doctor said not to use it, since my progesterone numbers were much higher.  My third month on clomid I got pregnant.<br>  <br>  There is a warning on the label not to take while you are pregnant, but my doctor said it was safe and everything I read about it said it is often used when ttc.  The only side affect I got with it was hot flashes.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest using preseed.  It is a lubricant that creates a friendly environment for his boys to swim in.  I used it the third month I was on clomid and that is when I got pregnant.  I really think that helped.  You can buy it at www.preseed.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!
8DnIXwnyaa	she had 6 implanted 2 split so she will have 2 sets of identical twins and 4 individual babies<br>  <br>  your eggs can split and i believe with ivf it increase the chance the egg will split because you are on hormones to help the embryos take.|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	In general, it will depend.  8 different eggs implanted (fertilized) will give you 8 children.  However, 4 eggs implanted can still give you 8 children -- 4 sets of twins.  There are more mathematical possibilities, so it would depend on how many eggs there were to start with.<br>  <br>  Interesting question, though.|`|TwcAQPupaa	Well, even the ones that are "fraternal" (not identical) could still look alike.  Mary Kate and Ashely Olson are not identical twins, but they look an awful lot alike!  I have a set of twin boys.  I don't know if they are identical or fraternal, but they look exactly alike.  I guess there are at least 2 sets of identical twins included in the octuplets.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I've watched some of the stuff on this crazy woman also and it has raised a lot of questions from me as well.<br>  <br>  I'm not answering the way you wanted because the poster above me said what I would've said.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	In her case she had 6 embryo's implanted so there were 6 babies but 2 of them split into twins so of the 8, 4 will look like no one else and then the other 4, 2 will look like each other and the other 2 will look alike, but all 8 will not look alike.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Well, in her case, she had 6 embryos implanted and 2 of them split...giving her 2 sets of twins.

OQnRP6xVaa	I am not sure about International but, know that for a state adoption that sort of thing would be discovered during the home study IF the Workers are doing their job correctly. <br>  <br>  I also think it would depend on what the nature of Unfit is...  Some international adoptions have different guidelines and there would be a difference between being Unfit by the standard of guidelines at the beginning--and being found unfit later in the process for withholding information or some other reason.<br>  <br>  The Same Sex couple interested in adopting from One country and found unfit to adopt would not be unfit in say, Canada or in many parts of the US so--it depends on why the applicant was found unfit and where in the process the applicant was discovered to be unfit.<br>  <br>  Some people early in the process may not understand the difference between being denied the Right to Apply to Adopt and Being rejected based on being unfit so the way they post a Q or talk about the situation may be different then what it sounds like... <br>  <br>  I would however hope that any adoptive parent who has completed a Home Study process and found to be Unfit would include this information on any future applications for adoption as it would most likely come out during future home studies.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	NO- so you think it would be a good idea to adopt internationally if you are unfit to parent.  Those children in other countries deserve a parent that is fit. What are you saying?|`|zLoyo24Taa	Yes this should come out in the home study process. My husband and I are adopting internationally, we not only had to do a home study, but we had to also had to join a support group, have IQ testing (even thought I have a masters degree), and personality testing. I am sure people can lie about being found unfit here in the US, but if that is found out you will also loose your ability to adopt internationally as well. In some countries you are not able to adopt if you have been arrested for anything more than a traffic ticket.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I had to go back and look at the forms we kept copies of from our adoption from India and there was a question asked to that effect.  The question read "Have you ever been found unsuit (sic) for adoption before?"  It was a locally produced form and I'm not sure if it would be used in all cases of international adoption but it was asked in our case even though our case was a bit different.  <br>  <br>  If it isn't asked all the time, it should be.|`|AA12174100	not sure on an answer for that one...but I would think that if a person was found "unfit" to adopt in home country then that would be a red flag that no one would let them adopt. International adoptions are harder to do then domestic.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	If not you darn well should HAVE to.  This is a little gem of info I'm sure most people would leave out.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Yes.  We had to answer a question about whether we had ever had a homestudy rejected.|`|Jy2RF9Szaa	I am not sure I understand your question. <br>  <br>  If you are wondering if you are supposed to declare *if* you have been found unfit, the answer is yes. We were asked something along the lines of "In the past, have you ever had a homestudy in which you were not approved to adopt?"<br>  <br>  If you are asking if everyone who adopts internationally must declare that they are unfit in their home country (as though that is the reason people adopt internationally), then no, because we were *not* found unfit to adopt in our home country. I know many people are against international adoption on principle, but international adoptive parents have to pass all the same requirements as domestic adoptive parents PLUS whatever additional requirements the child's country sets. <br>  <br>  There are ways for dishonest people to get around it, and I am not opposed to closing any loopholes, but the questions are asked. (For instance, I don't know of any place that catalogs 'failed' homestudies. So if someone answered the 'have you ever failed a homestudy?" question by saying "no" even if the truth was that they had failed, I don't know how anyone would ever find out.) I think 99% of people are truthful, but for the sake of the children, there should be a better way to catch the other 1%.<br>  <br>  ETA: Skykisser -- If what you say is true, the agency they used should be reported. ALL adoptions, including Russian ones, require a homestudy -- and for international adoptions, you have to send a copy of it to USCIS to get a visa to bring the child back to the US. I don't see a way to get around that requirement -- and any jail time *should* show up on the FBI fingerprint/background check required for the homestudy (that is one area where your answers are *not* self-reported.) Not every arrest equals immediate disqualification, but either drug possession or assault ought to disqualify them.  Psychological examinations are required on a region-by-region basis in Russia. Most regions require it now, and some agencies do even if the region does not... but it might be possible to go to a region that did not require it. However, I still do not see how your co-worker could have adopted from Russia through the "normal channels." Very shady sounding, indeed, and whatever agency helped them should be turned in.|`|a695392f1d08cb51892a2580128302a2aa	I am not sure about other countries, but in the US you have to be found as a fit parent in the US FIRST, and then prove yourself as a fit adoptive parents according to the country that you are adopting from.  Meaning, you have to prove yourself TWICE.  There are home studies, medical exams, psych exams, financial investigations, police clearances, educational requirements, religious requirements, just to name a few of the things that come to mind.  It is no easy feat to prove yourself fit as adoptive parents.  People who think all you have to do is lay money on the table and you get a child....are misinformed.|`|zs1C1G1waa	I'm not sure exactly what you're asking.  Both international and domestic adoptions require a homestudy.  If the homestudy agency wouldn't approve someone to adopt domestically, then they wouldn't be approved internationally, either.  So, it's not possible that someone could fail a background check and still adopt intenationally.  In fact, international adoption requires another level of background checks:  U.S. immigration.  There could be a case of a family passing a homestudy (being approved to adopt) but they don't meet the requirememts for a certain program (age, single status, BMI) but do meet the requirements of another program, but that is different than being declared unfit to adopt (not passing the homestudy).  Typically, there are more requirements for international adoption programs than adopting domestically.<br>  <br>  ETA:  What Skykiss is saying is just outright wrong and is just uneducated repeating something incorrectly.  Now, she could have been told about some shady practices in Russia or some shady practices by the agency used.  But, all international adoption require a homestudy or the child WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE U.S. by U.S. immigration.  They wouldn't be given a visa.  Neither the agency or the foreign government can change that.|`|2f49jsLpaa	No, chances are if you are found unfit to adopt in the US, then you will also not be allowed to adopt internationally. I'm not sure where people get the idea that the rules for adopting from other countries are less strict, but I really think it's the opposite. I've met many people who've adopted domestically or through US fostercare, who would have never met the requirements that many countries have for international adoption.<br>  <br>  I think the reason many people say it's "easier" to adopt internationally is because with dom. infant adoption, just because you meet all of the qualifications, doesn't mean you are going to be chosen by a woman planning to place her child. That's when what you look like, what type of jobs and education you have, and how nice your home is comes into play. WIith fostecare adoption it's "harder" because the system doesn't always work quickly or logically, and despite the fact that there are many children waiting to be adopted, families may in some cases still wait years to have a child placed with them, and jump through many hoops that don't always make since.<br>  <br>   With international adoptions, the requirements for things like marriage length, physical and mental health, and age may be stricter, but if you meet the requirements and pass the home study then you will eventually get a referral (even if you don't have a pool and a pony).|`|3i7hufq4aa	If anything, the requirements for adopting internationally are often even more stringent than for domestic, depending on the country. Many countries have requirements on age, fertility, BMI, no-antidepressant medication-ever, etc. This makes sense to me. If a country is losing some of its most precious "resources" (its children), then they damned well better be able to set their own criteria for what kind of families they want for their children. Not that it always works out that way.
DvrpBX4saa	There are some concerns over the chemicals used in disposable diapers. Some studies show that the gel in the diapers can cause infertility in males. When you research further about the chemicals involved (including the same stuff that can cause toxic shock syndrome from women's tampons), it can get worrisome to some mothers. <br>  I do cloth diaper because it is better for the environment (water is a reusable energy source, and disposables stay in the landfills for HUNDREDS of years. Disposables also use a lot of oil and other pollutants to be produced and the chemicals in them can leech into waters and soil) and because I prefer to cloth diaper. But I'm not neurotic about it. we still use disposables frequently. <br>  Don't let anyone judge you and don't judge this lady. She just cares for the environment and wants to be as chemical free as possible, which isn't a bad thing.|`|znkumaA1aa	Your SIL is lucky to have such a mom. Chlorine free is a step up in terms of safety and quality.Chlorine is "bleach" and many moms are simply being wiser about diapering. Chlorine is carcinogenic (cancer causing) and it just makes sense to expose your new baby to one less toxin. The ones from Seventh Generation are also better for the environment. Non chlorine is better...breastmilk is too|`|ArKT9O7Maa	I think that this is a standard for diapers.  Chlorine is a poisonous chemical element when not mixed with other elements into a stable compound like table salt.  You don't have to worry, because diapers with chlorine in them are probably illegal to sell in the U.S. anyway.  I think this is just a flashy sign used in to lure companies away from big brands that are probably more regulated.  Many companies are using these nearly-pointless advertising techniques that say the standards for everything.  It's just another form of consumer fraud.|`|rDPADat1aa	Those are Seventh Generation Diapers and are awesome for the baby!  There are a lot of unnatural chemicals in paper diapers these days, including chlorine.  Lots of babies break out in rashes due to allergic reactions from them, though most parents don't realize that's why.

I wouldnt be taken aback to each their own.  If I see something different in the store I often want to try it.<br>  <br>  and no all diapers are no chhlorine free.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	good god ... thats a bit neurotic.<br>  <br>  If she was sooo enviro-friendly she should use cloth... but actually cloth arnt really better for the environment either unless your handwashing them in cold water with no soap. <br>  <br>  I dont think they are any healthier - just some kids are allergic to chlorine ... i guess? Again though ... if the kids allergic just use cloth! <br>  <br>  The Mother sounds a bit like shes a sandwich short of a picnic ... im sure my child in her chlorine filled diapers is going to be just fine though!
KOwzDLPdaa	If they are consistently ten minutes apart you should go to the doctor now. They can check to see if you are dilating and if you are they will likely remove the baby via c-section today. Hope your ready!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|AA12395149	If the contractions are not going away, you need to go to the hospital and be evaluated.  There is a risk that your uterus could rupture from the contractions (although it is a very low risk).  At the hospital they make give you IV fluids to see if that stops the labor because you are still a bit preterm.  But I really think you should go in and get evaluated, especially if you have been contracting for a few hours and they are regular.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|EnCbkStYaa	hello..<br>  <br>  if you want read something about healthy,pregnancy question,or sign about pregnancy..<br>  i come just accross this blog : <a href="http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogsp...</a> which may help you.|`|TtTMh4xKaa	im 33weeks and i get weird sharp pains "Down there" but no contractions...|`|XHHkBkwOaa	i would call an ambulance safer that way because you cant drive or get your hubbie to take you <br>  <br>  you seriously need to go NOW <br>  <br>  as what you have said is very true dont take any chances <br>  who knows you could have this bub tonight<br>  <br>  congrats on your bub!
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	some babies wont turn on their own until they are ready to come out.  If she isnt going to turn, have the DR try to. a c-section is major surgery and not something to be taken lightly <br>  <br>  after my c-section, I could hardly walk. it hurt to laugh, cough, sneeze, etc. JUST SAY NO!!!!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	My sister had the same problem and instead of having the Dr. try to turn her, she went to a Chiropractor and had her hips adjusted and that made the baby turn itself. She said it was something about if your hips are not in line then your uterus is not in line so the baby does not have the room it needs to flip around. She said it can take 1-3 times of having your hips adjusted to have the baby move, but hers moved on the first try. She went during the day and when she was laying in bed that night she said she watched her hole belly flip around. Just another option for you as her Dr. did not tell her about this, she found this out from her midwife.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Why would you not have him try? It's not either-or. If it doesn't work you haven't lost anything.<br>  <br>  I've had 2 C-sections. In both cases I was more or less back to myself in about six weeks (in the UK, that's when you are insured to drive again) - but of course it's hard to tell because with a new baby isn't exactly optimum recovering conditions!<br>  <br>  One thing I would say is that if there's a very high chance of you needing a C-section, a planned one is easier to recover from than an emergency one.|`|C4miEeuYaa	I haven't personally had a c-section..But the few I do know said that they wish that surgery upon no one. They said it took them about 2 weeks to get back to normal, and that it was just awful. I think you should try and have them turn the baby. If it doesn't work, then you'll have the c-section, but at least try to prevent it..I wish you the best of luck and congrats on your baby girl. :)|`|KOwzDLPdaa	My best friend went in to get her baby turned and ended up waiting 4 hours because the doctor was called in for an emergency. While she was waiting, the baby tuned herself :)<br>  <br>   I would say if you are certain its your last baby, take the section. Its better to have it pre-planned than be an emergency one. You can still nurse if you were planning on it. And for example I am having a section the first week of June and am having my tubes tied at the same time since my husband and I are sure we don't want a fourth baby. <br>  <br>  I have had two sections, the first was an emerg and the second was scheduled. The scheduled one I healed faster, 4 weeks compared to a full 6. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I would suggest letting them turn the head down. I have had a vaginal birth and a c-section, and the vaginal birth was much easier! My daughter was breach as well, but the DRs didn't catch it until I was 8cm dilated and ready to start pushing. <br>  <br>  It took a couple of weeks before I could even stand up with out being in pain. But by 6 weeks I was pretty much back to normal. It is hard after a c-section because you cannot hold your baby right away, you are pumped up with drugs, breastfeeding can be an issue for some women, and you cannot even drive for several weeks after leaving the hospital. Plus you still bleed for a few weeks afterwords.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	although it is very painful I would have the doctor try and turn your baby providing that you don't have a long time to wait for delivery. I had a c-section with my daughter almost 15 years ago and i still have trouble toning the lower tummy area because all of the nerves where cut and  stretched skin is the ending result. it took me 2 months after the section to fee like myself again.|`|JMP9pt5raa	I'm due a few days before you on the 18th. I have a transverse baby (sideways) and will find out on Wednesday what the plan of action is. I'd prefer a C section and sterilisation at the same time. I wonder if thats a tall order. <br>  I don't want to spend any longer in this situation than I have to, but it's also very important that baby's lungs are ready too.<br>  <br>  Good luck whatever you decide.|`|CIBtfxEqaa	I had a section and it was AWESOME. Wouldn't trade my birthing experience for anything in the world. I pushed for an hour and a half and was miserable the whole time. I bounced right back from the section, I was admitted at 3:00 in the afternoon on October 31st, had her at 6:06 that night, and was discharged at 11:00 am on November 2. I was down for probably 2 days at home, and then was back to laundry and dishes! My husband helped out a lot too. The hardest part is that first shower they give you in the hospital. Not too fun. But if you can get past that, you will be fine! Good luck Mommy!|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	My last baby was breech and I wasn't given the option of anything other than a csection. My doctor said it was just safer that way. I really hated the idea of a csecion after already having 2 previous vaginal deliveries, the second of which was just so easy. I dreaded my csection for weeks. Then once my water broke and it was all happening, it went very quickly. My son was born only 3 hours after my water broke and labor started, that includes the hour and 20 minutes it took for me to get to the hospital. Recovery wasn't as bad as I expected. The first week was pretty bad but so was the first week after a vaginal delivery. After the first week, recovery went pretty fast. I honestly don't know which way I would choose next time. Both have their positives and negatives.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	From a mom who had a c section. I would say try letting the dr turn her first. After 22 hrs of labor and only dilateing to 6 cms. It was putting my son in distress and I was exhausted. So they did the surgery. For me personally having the surgery in general was the worst bc I felt almost 90% of my surgery ex: cutting,sewing up,pulling the baby out etc. I had to be pumped full of meds 2x during the whole thing. I was so out of it. I didnt get to walk or do anything until 12 hrs after. Trying to get to the bathroom, do number 2 or just getting up and down in general with that was hard. I am hoping and trying for a VBAC next time around. Only way I will do a c section again if I or the baby have an emergency and it needs out now. I will not do it just bc the dr or nurses just dont wont to be bothered. I took me a few weeks to get everything back to normal without pulling my stitches and I couldnt drive till 2 wks after|`|u1DDrXO2aa	I think to be on the safe side i would chose c-section its really not all that bad i had one in oct and the induced me at 12:00pm and at 8am they broke my water and i was dilated 6cm until 3pm when they decided to go ahead with the c-section i was scared to death and cried the whole time it was just a lot of pressure and once i saw my son it didnt matter what they were doing anymore...every women is different keep that in mind i was in labor for 15hrs its major surgery so of course it will take a while to heal id say about 2 weeks i was feeling back to myself its painful after i could barely move it hurt so bad although they give you pain killers so they help a little its been 4 months and i still get sore sometimes and my scare itches all the time....good luck!!|`|uAhpXUoLaa	My son wouldn't turn and I had the doctors try to turn him. It is a painful experience. He ended up not turning even when the doctors tried and I had to have a c-section. It ended up that the cord was wrapped around his neck and that is why he wouldn't turn. I would let the doctors try to turn your baby and if they can't then I would go for the c-section. It took about 6 weeks to recover from the c-section. One thing that you have to remember that I didn't know was that your doctor won't let you drive for 6 weeks. My son is almost 3 now and sometimes I still feel numbness in my stomach where I had the surgery. One good thing about us trying to have the baby turned is our ultrasound said that I was having a girl and we had bought all the girl things and when they tried to turn the baby we found out it was a boy and had enough time to go exchange all of the girl things we had already bought:) Good luck!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I would just go with the C section.  I seemed to bounce right back after mine.  I was up walking around the next day(slowly) and in 5 days I wasn't feeling any pain at all.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I desperately wanted a vaginal delivery but my water ruptured prematurely.  I waited 12 hours for labor to start naturally (it did not) and was induced for 24 hours (to 75 percent effaced, 0 centimeters dilated.)  So, pretty obviously, c-section it was.  By that point, I was philosophical about it.<br>  <br>  Considering how much I dreaded the recovery, it was not that bad.  I hated the actual experience of having a c-section, but that's only an hour an a half.<br>  <br>  The first 24 hours are rough, no doubt.  And it is not easy to recover from surgery while caring for a new born.<br>  <br>  But at about 10 days I felt substantially better.  Not ready to do sit-ups, but really, really functional.  It was kind of amazing.<br>  <br>  I think I felt pretty normal by 2 months, though then I over-exerted and had some pain and had to take it easy for another few weeks .  (As easy as you can with a newborn.)<br>  <br>  I returned to work part-time for a while at 12 weeks and was totally fine.  Though I waited until about 5 months before I did a sit-up.

I have PPD and I stopped taking my meds a little while ago on my own, and I shouldnt have.<br>  But from the PPD I just went through the motions when Brody was first born, I could change his diaper, change his clothes, feed him a bottle, all while being caught up in my own thoughts and realizing I havent even talked to my baby. I still struggle so much with being a mom. I feel like I dont have a bond with my son that I should have. I feel like he deserves better than me. I feel like a terrible person when I feel like I cant cope with being a single mother.<br>  I could never have imagined how hard this was going to be for me.<br>  I battle myself in my mind everyday. Im my own worst enemy, if I could just STOP THINKING sometimes, I think I'd be better off.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	My biggest struggle so far is treating the kids the same.  I'm a full time step mother to a 4 yr old girl, and I have a newborn son and I find myself favoring my son over her sometimes, which makes me feel like a horrible person.  I'm working on it though.|`|AA12145826	I have to agree with you. I'm probably my own worst critic when it comes to my parenting technique. We strive to be the best parent we can be and yes, sometimes we fail, but that's the art of parenting isn't it? Its just as much a "practice" as it is anything else.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Mine right now is how to deal with my oldest daughter when my husband is gone to Iraq for 6-8months. My husband was gone for 3days last week and she totally freaked out when she woke up te 2nd day and he wasn't home.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Not being in control. It's really difficult for me to accept that when they are sick, or hurt or upset there's only so much I can do to help, I always worry that i'm not doing a good enough job.|`|a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	Keeping the Family a family and not just a group of individuals.|`|v6lkMHLdaa	getting in the head of my son <6>
AA10478980	Pregnancy - Enjoy it.  Get as much sleep as possible, because you may not get much for a few months after the baby is born.  Don't allow your pregnancy to become over-medicalized.  Pregnancy is a natural situation.  Do some fun things you've been meaning to do but didn't get around to before.<br>  <br>  Labor & Delivery - While there certainly is some pain involved, you forget about it immediately when the baby arrives.  When you hold that little bundle in your arms, that is all that matters, and you realize what a wonderful thing has happened.<br>  <br>  Postpartum/Recovery - Pay attention to what they tell you at the hospital and do what they tell you.  Let other people help - don't try to do everything yourself.  Rest, rest, rest.  Sleep when you can.   Again, this is all a natural process, and usually goes well.  Pay attention to your moods and emotions though, because post partum depression is real, but is also easily treated.<br>  <br>  The First Week Home - Don't try to entertain visitors.  Ask friends to stay home to let you recover a little, and to get used to having a baby in the house.  Sleep when the baby sleeps.  Don't worry about housework and so on - just take care of yourself and the baby for the first couple of weeks.  Accept help from others, and ask for help if you need it.<br>  <br>  And most importantly I would share this poem written in the 1950's:<br>  <br>  Babies Don’t Keep<br>  By Ruth Hulbert Hamilton<br>  <br>  Mother, O Mother, come shake out your cloth,<br>  Empty the dustpan, poison the moth,<br>  Hang out the washing, make up the bed,<br>  Sew on a button and butter the bread.<br>  Where is the mother whose house is so shocking?<br>  She’s up in the nursery, blissfully rocking.<br>  <br>  Oh, I’ve grown as shiftless as Little Boy Blue,<br>  Lullabye, rockabye, lullabye loo.<br>  Dishes are waiting and bills are past due,<br>  Lullabye, rockaby, lullabye loo.<br>  The shopping’s not done and there’s nothing for stew<br>  And out in the yard there’s a hullabaloo,<br>  But I’m playing Kanga and this is my Roo,<br>  Lullabye, rockaby lullabye loo.<br>  <br>  The cleaning and scrubbing can wait till tomorrow<br>  But children grow up as I’ve learned to my sorrow.<br>  So quiet down cobwebs;<br>  Dust go to sleep!<br>  I’m rocking my baby and babies don’t keep.|`|wEwNDYPkaa	Relax and take it slow x|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Pregnancy- Sleep when you are tired, Cry when you need to cry,  Sit down if you are exhausted. Enjoy it while it lasts. Don't be afraid to ask a million questions and demand answers to said questions. If you feel something is off get checked out. Who cares how crazy or paranoid the doctors think you are. YOU know your body and YOU know when something is off.  3rd trimester don't be afraid to ask for help. There is no shame in it.<br>  <br>  Labor & Delivery- Know that the pain doesn't last forever, that at the end of the pain you will be holding your new baby. Pain will be forgotten. Use a doctor you know and like. If you're at a doctors office with more than 1 doctor make sure you have seen them all. So if a different doctor from the office is on call some stranger isn't there to deliver your baby.  Take pain medication if needed. <br>  <br>  Postpartum/Recover- Know that it recovery wont be overnight. You will be sore not matter if its vaginal or c-section.  Go to all of your postpartum doctor appointments. <br>  <br>  First week home-  Sleep as much and as often as you can. Don't worry about the house it can wait. The mess will be there tomorrow. Don't try to be superwoman it wont happen and you'll drive yourself crazy. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Cleaning, with the baby, anything. All mom's have been a first time mom and they will understand your need for help. Don't turn down help that is freely offered.  Don't think everyone has to see your baby right away. You may not feel up to it and thats OK. <br>  <br>  Some information my mom gave me.<br>  <br>  An extra 20 minutes to sleep can be a life saver<br>  A shower is a good place to relax. Take one even if you don't feel like it. You will feel better once clean.<br>  Don't forget to take care of mom.  She is just as important as the baby is.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Pregnancy - Enjoy every minute of it!  <br>  <br>  Labor & Delivery - You won't remember any pain or how anything felt.  As soon as you have that baby in your arms, everything else just magically goes away.  :)<br>  <br>  Postpartum/Recovery - I had a c-section.  My recovery wasn't the greatest, but that's because I couldn't lay down and rest (I'm a single mom).  Try to take it easy.<br>  <br>  The First Week Home - SLEEP WHEN THE BABY SLEEPS!  That's the best advice I can give you.  Don't worry about the house cleaning or laundry or whatever, just get as much rest as you possibly can.|`|j2mRop0laa	I the first month home is actually the thing she needs to start planning. <br>  I came up with a routine that saved me.<br>  I prepared for my entire day, the night before. It took me an hour and I was so glad I did it. <br>  I spent an hour tidying up (dishes, tossing in a load of wash, putting things away, premake coffee, setting out bottles/ wipes/ diapers etc on the changing table. Setting out several onesies and making up the diaper bag in case we needed to run quickly. I took my shower in the evening as soon as she went to bed, too.<br>  Waking up and getting ready for the day was easy as pie. I could relax all day with the baby without running around trying to get everything organized.<br>  <br>  That's the best advice I have.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	For all of those your body knows what it's doing. It needs no "help" in normal circumstances. Sleep when you're tired, especially towards the end of your pregnancy and babies first few weeks.<br>  Once baby is here...do what works for YOUR family. It does not matter what decisions you make SOMEbody will tell you you're doing it wrong, that there is a better way. So, just do what works for you and YOUR family.<br>  <br>  <br>  I had a young mom asking the other day how she was supposed to deal with temper tantrums in her young toddler. This was exactly the same advice I gave her. Don't necessarily do what I do, don't necessarily do what your mother did. Find what works for YOU and just do it without worrying about everyone else's opinions.<br>  <br>  <br>  **eta**The best piece of advice ever given to ME was from my mother-in-law. My children need me TODAY the dishes will wait. The laundry will be there tomorrow but my children will be grown and I will have missed everything important for worrying about less important things.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	First and foremost - trust yourself, you will be fine and you know your baby best.  you do.<br>  pregnancy - it will pass and you will have a beautiful baby.  <br>  labor - it will end and you don't need to have pain to have a baby - gotta love an epidural<br>  postpartum - love that body that created, carried, and delivered that baby.  its going to do some weird things and you will feel all kinds of different things, but appreciate what it did.  it is truly amazing.<br>  first week home - sleep, sleep, sleep - when baby sleeps.  the house can wait.  the dishes can wait.  the laundry can wait.  everything but the baby can wait.  you need sleep to be human.  its okay.  and don't turn down help.  if they offer, let them.  <br>  <br>  unwanted advice (you missed that category) smile and ignore the idiots.  you can do it and you aren't a bad mom for not doing it someone elses way.  ignore them.<br>  <br>  edit - oh and don't watch crazy shows on tlc or discovery channel about weirdos who attack pregnant ladies.  i swear it was the stupidest thing i ever did.  i was obsessed w/them.  i should never ever have watched them.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I would say get back to the basics and stop crazing yourself out with studies and stats... just go by your own mothers intuition and use the guides and studies as a grounds of help..not your bible for raising children because NOBODY but you knows how best to raise your child and these studies are just so general.  (this is more for the whole life of your child)<br>  <br>  Also take all advice you get with a grain of salt, no matter who it is coming from.<br>  <br>  anyway to touch on your areas:<br>  <br>  Pregnancy- enjoy it... it goes by fast. be your own advocate and if you feel something is not right go with it... the worst that can happen is you could be crazy and wrong...this is the health of your baby you are talking about, take NO chances. <br>  <br>  Labor & Delivery- its can be long, and tedious, and you may want to kill your partner.. but this too will pass... take the drugs if you want and need them...they DO help a lot.<br>  <br>  Postpartum/Recovery- get all the help you can... especially if you end up with a c-section. tell the nurses everything.. any thing that is makig you uncomfortable. that is what they are there for<br>  <br>  The First Week Home- have help, sleep when the baby sleeps and try to have meals made in advance that you just have to warm up... that heps SO much and ensures you are eating well and keeping up your energy. drink drink drink lots and lots of water.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Pregnancy:<br>  Haha - you will experience more abnormal moments than normal moments I think.  Let your standard of modesty slowly decrease.  :)<br>  <br>  Labor/Delivery:<br>  Something will happen that you won't expect.  That is ok.  Make a plan, and a plan B, and a plan C.  When all 3 go haywire, remember that our bodies are meant to do this and you can do it with a good attitude.<br>  <br>  Postpartum:<br>  Your body will recover and function normally again, I promise.<br>  <br>  The first week:<br>  And you thought you knew what tired meant!  Haha... but really - mommy can't take care of baby unless somebody is taking care of mommy.  Your baby comes first, yea yea, but you have to eat and rest too, or it won't do your baby any good.  Ask for help, more than once.
Jo2DfRzaaa	if shes 21 and not drinking during the school day, i'd join her!  i would love to hear some crazy stories that she must have.  i find it amusing, personally.   so did you get any silly stories out of her?|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I would think it was funny.<br>  It's not school hours, and she must be over 21.<br>  I say it's fine. No profession should require you to be in job mode 24 7.<br>  I know its different because it was YOUR sons teacher, lol so it makes it interesting, but it wouldnt bother me.|`|znjl6WrWaa	I wouldn't have a problem with it at all. and it gives you a chance to see what your son's teacher is like on a more personal level.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Kind of odd to be mixing socially with one of my kids' teachers, but as long as she is legal, I see no harm in it.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	I think that'd be way cool!! LOL|`|ogU0AEkOaa	Well as a mother of three i wouldn't too much think much about it...UNLESS u seen the teacher getting  REALLY toasted which  i don't think he would being around "THA PARENTS" and your hubby would have peeked any funny business im sure.. but all in all the teacher is also human.. so i would of enjoyed myself..|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	This actually works great for you...you get to know her better, just like she is, and if you say it was fun and healthy drinking, then there`s nothing wrong with it. Teachers are allowed to drink after all, and have fun. Just like you as good parents. Getting to know the teachers outside from school is never an opportunity, you always talk to them just inside the school, parents never really get to know them very well or what they do. Now you`ve gotten to know her, know how she really is and feel better that she`s a good teacher and a good example for your son. I think it worked out great!|`|AkFag8tNaa	Teachers have a right to life the same as anyone. The only thing I would have a problem with is if the teacher did something unsavory that I wouldn't want them exposed to. If she was say, a moonlighting prostitute or drug dealer but embibing in the occasional drink is no biggie unless you can't control yourself.
oUcLSDZ6aa	I think it's great when you need to get stuff done. Definitely better that a playpen or crib. <br>  <br>  But, I also know that it won't take very long for said toddler to learn to lift it. <br>  <br>  I've never used them myself personally, but my friend has one. She ended up taking it apart and using each gate individually. <br>  <br>  I don't see why it would be lazy parenting, how does it differ from a playpen? Everyone needs to tend to things other than the baby once in a while. What would you recommend as an alternative?|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well we have one and use it to block the heater off and took it apart and have used a part to block off another piece of furniture.<br>  <br>  So we have never actually used it as a play yard, my son hated being in it.<br>  <br>  Better to just baby proof a room and let the child roam freely around the room, that's what we have done.<br>  <br>  I think they are useless as what they are intended for, I wouldn't think any baby that can crawl would be happy in one being restricted like that, they aren't that big.|`|AA10529334	No I dont think its lazy parenting. Everyone needs someplace to put baby that is safe and so you are able to get some things done. <br>  <br>  I think they are cool - but will only work until the child can walk.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	It never proved very useful to us as a playpen thing.  We ended up detaching it and using it as a big barrier to our fireplace.|`|KDb96QS7aa	I have two being shipped to me as I type. I plan on hooking them together and this 36-sq foot space will be the only truly babyproof area of the house. I live in an apt and am unable due to the cubbord style and the cheap quality of the walls to babyproof well. As much as I'd like to be able to keep a close eye on my increasingly mobile baby every minute, sometimes I need to shower...or go to the bathroom...and (occasionally) clean the bathroom. You get the idea.  This was essential for me!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think it depends on the household situation.  It might be cool in a backyard, or useful if there were a couple of dogs around.  It could certainly be used to allow parents to be lazy.  It could also be used sensibly.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I have 2 of them hooked together, each end is bolted to a wall forming a barrier across half of a large room.  I use this to block off a safe area for my home daycare.  I think its wonderful.  If you only have one it is quite small.  <br>  <br>  We also used part of it at christmas to keep our 13 month old out of the tree and presents
HUQQzph2aa	My 23 month daughter is the same way. I aways have grapes on the table and if she sees them she want them. I typically don't have food out for that reason or I throw a clean kitchen towel over the fruit bowl (out of site out of mind). <br>  <br>  He is still young, he'll understand more once he gets a little older.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Even though babies do have smaller appetites, unless you want to always be stuck making 2 meals, I would make him eat what you made. (unless it is really spicy or he has an allergy). When you are out in restaurants, I would let him help decide what he wants. I have always given my kids 2 choices. If I try more than that, I think it gets a little overwhelming for them. If he gets hungry enough, he will eat. Obviously there will always be exceptions, but maybe if he gets to pick what he eats at restaurants, it will help keep those meltdowns at bay!|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Tell him he eats his food first or he goes hungry.  Then he can have the grapes.  Ignore the crying.<br>  <br>  How can an 18 month old decide on what is healthy for him?|`|FQrl1Azbaa	if he understands, then tell him he can have some when he has finished his own.<br>  <br>  try to give him a choice of 2 things for lunch so he feels he has picked his lunch.|`|xwOwsZvEaa	be patient when there hungry they will eat. but fruit is a good one whenever they want it.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I always allow fruit...even at mealtimes and especially before as this is the best time to eat it...it is digested better before rather than after. At 18 months and even up till the age of 6 children have small appetites...6 small meals is often more realistic than 3 larger ones.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If it's something healthy (fruit, something off your plate at a restaurant) I'd let him have some.  There's no law that says food has to be eaten in a specific order.

pvH3oHRfaa	Hey, I had similar problems with my daughter, and she too slept with me for the first 4 months.<br>  <br>  She now sleeps in her own cot from 7pm until around 11/12 when she eats, and then goes straight back to sleep until around 4/5 when she eats again and the straight back to sleep until around 7/7.30<br>  <br>  She was waking every 2 hours during the night to eat, sometimes when she really didn't need to, but now I put her dummy in, and if she's not hungry, she normally goes straight back to sleep. Do you give her a dummy? I know some people don't like them, but for babies who like to suck, they are a god send.<br>  <br>  I also started giving her more solids as she was definitely not getting enough from me anymore. She now has 3 meals a day, plus breastfeeds still 3/4 times a day. I'm sure this has helped her sleep longer.<br>  <br>  I also find that trying to keep her awake in the day doesn't help. I find that if she has good naps during the day, she sleeps better during the night.<br>  <br>  I suppose it's the curse of breastfeeding really, that they digest their food more quickly, but when they get up just for comfort, it can be really tiring. Try a dummy if she doesn't already have one. Or try just reassuring her with a little rub or something. I'm sure she'll grow out of it soon.|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	When my daughter was 6 months old she was sleeping through the night.  She went to bed at 6 and woke up at 7.  My doctor told me to start trying to give her more frequent feedings during the day and then at night she would not need as many and it worked great!  Have you tried starting solids yet?  It would be that she just may be hungry.  If all else fails call the doctor.  Good luck, hope this helped!|`|PDeqVNQvaa	You stated that you are nursing her, try oatmeal or rice cereal before bedtime or give her a bottle of formula (because you might not be satisfying her) to fill up her tiny belly.<br>  <br>  Our almost 15 month old still will not sleep through the night.  He still will wake up around midnight for a drink, then back to sleep he goes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|iTXnHiwTaa	at 6 mos. my twins would sleep 10-12 hours, waking once to eat. if they happened to wake up for other reasons, I'd have to quickly rush in to soothe them and replace their binkie. this is so one wouldn't wake the other but also so I'd catch the awake baby quickly enough that she'd still be drowsy and fall back asleep fast. if i let her stay awake longer than a few minutes w/o going in to her, she'd get so worked up that only rocking and a bottle would work. i find some babies don't respond well to being left alone to cry - not at first anyway. they are higher needs in general and not as self soothing.  they need those extra cuddles and mama's touch. my twins were night and day in this regard. in any case, i think as long as you catch them right away and the soothing doesn't last forever, she'll learn to self soothe on her own when she's ready and it doesn't create a bad habit. mine are almost 9 mos now and usually fall asleep on their own if they wake - if they don't then they're usually hungry.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	My baby starting doing this too, she is 6 months also. She is teething so I think she wakes up in pain. Last night I think she got up like 5 times, I lost count. Usually she goes to bed at 9pm gets up about 2-3 times, then wakes at 7:30. But since she has been teething and started solids she has some night were she is up every hour! If your daughter has been doing this since birth you might want to mention it to her doc at her 6 month. She could have reflux, does it seem like she is in pain. My baby is really gassy so that keeps her up a lot, I use mylicon gas drops  and it helps..sometimes. <br>  <br>  I feel so bad for you, I totally understand how tired you are. I almost get a little mad when I hear other people say their babies have been sleeping threw the night for months now. I can't wait for mine to start too.
Bg6txvxqaa	If you tell your midwife you are stressing about this they may give you extra scans.<br>  <br>  I'm having to go to the hospital for an ultrasound every month now to check on the growth etc.<br>  <br>  Plus, they should check to see the position of the baby and check that the cord is not wrapped around the neck or anything horrible like that.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that your baby will be fine. It's horribel to hear about those other poor people though. Not sure I'd know how to cope if that were me.<br>  <br>  they do regular scans past 28 weeks I think for a singleton and check everything until the birth. But, if you tell them you are stressing yourself out about this, they may give you special treatment and give you some scans to put your mind at rest.<br>  <br>  You will hear and find out about so many nasty things whilst you are pregnant and they will all make you worry but just try to stay calm and tell your midwife any worries you have about anything!|`|EnCbkStYaa	hello..<br>  <br>  if you want read something about healthy,pregnancy question,or sign about pregnancy..<br>  i come just accross this blog : <a href="http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogsp...</a> which may help you.|`|79eRDIbXaa	OMG I cant believe that - Its so Horrible<br>  I feel so bad for your Friend<br>  Im really scared now - please get back to me with anything you are told about this.

Basically, they count how many centimeters of fluid surround your baby in the four quadrants of your uterus.<br>  <br>  Some other tests they do to determine fetal well being include the non-stress test.  They just put you on the monitor and monitor the baby's heart beat and look for what are called accelerations (the heart beat increases by at least 15 beats per minute for at least 15 seconds), if they have three within a 30 minute period, they are looking good.<br>  <br>  A negative non-stress test may make them do a biophysical profile where they do an ultrasound and look at the amount of fluid, respiratory rate (yes, the baby uses its lungs in uteru...think of it as practice), and gross muscle movements.<br>  <br>  Most doctors will start the mom on non-stress tests and possible AFI (the ultrasound for fluids) twice weekly once she is 40 weeks.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and try not to worry too much about.  If you are still concerned, talk about it and ask lots of questions with your doctor or midwife.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	They do it by ultrasound. My doctor does a ultrasound at every appointment to check the AF levels. He says that just because the baby has a healthy heart beat and everything looks fine from the outside, their might be a problem inside. When you are over do I do not think that they test. Just keep an eye on it. If you notice any extra leaking or something that smells sweet report it to your doctor right away. <br>  <br>  In Lamaze class our teacher told us about a lady who didn't report to her doctor that she was leaking extra and it went on for about a week. Well she developed an infection and the baby had to be flown to another hospital while she stayed at that one. The baby was fine though.<br>  <br>  With out an ultrasound there really is no way to test your levels.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	they can see the fluid during an ultrasound, i can't belive that happended, if your overdue your dr should be looking almost daily at you and do a c-section if that babys not coming out or induce labor at 40 weeks, i dont see why drs let it go past, i know if i near my 40 weeks i will tell them to do a csection or induce me and if i have to i will make up excuss of pain, i wouldnt ever risk that<br>  <br>  i am soooo sorry for you friend, i couldnt imagine that, i had a ultrasound a week ago and they checked the fluid

3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Personally I think it's too soon.  You're going to have a HUGE carry-on bag and a crap-ton of stuff.  Plus, the new baby shouldn't be around that many new and strange people right away.  <br>  <br>  Also, it's not really goingt to be that relaxing of a vacation if the baby is up half the night wanting food and up most of the day wanting to play.  You're going to be exhausted.  Give yourself time to rest at  home and push the vaca back.|`|DDFSITiYaa	It will not be easy traveling with a newborn, espcially flying at that time of year with all the viruses that are enclosed in an airplane. <br>  I would never do it but I am particularly regimented about my babies and schedules.  I have a neighbor who travels all the time with her little babies and they are fine. <br>  <br>  It is more if you are the type of person who can handle it.  Are you a easy traveller?  Is that your lifestyle?  Do you see yourself doing it a lot with a baby?  Then go for it!  You can just as easily not sleep in Florida as you can not sleep at home =)|`|OBU1eDUHaa	It won't be much fun for you.  At 2 months you are still adjusting to lack of sleep and will want to nap whenever.  Also, you are really not going to up for going to a beach(no matter if you've lost all the baby weight or not, you will probably still feel a little awkward with your body).  You also won't want to take baby to the beach.  Baby will be eating every 2-3 hours still which is inconvenient if you are nursing-trying to find somewhere private to nurse in a tourist town is hard!  I would wait until baby is a sitting up on her/his own, it will be more fun then!  Good luck!|`|T0gv52CDaa	If you are flying, I think it is fine.  If you are planning to drive, DON'T DO IT!!!  It is not dangerous, but you will be insane by the end of the drive.  The first time we went any real distance with my oldest son, we drove, and it was the most miserable trip of my life.  Later that month, I had to go back, and decided to fly.  It was wonderful.  He was 1 1/2 before we ever tried a driving vacation with him again, but he has flown plenty of times now, and is great on planes.  Just make sure you either nurse or give him a bottle for take offs & landings.|`|vBR9nB81aa	I am a first time mother also, and when my little one was 3 weeks old I took her up to Ohio with me on a plane (I am from Florida!). She was WONDERFUL on the plane and in the airport. She had a hard time sleeping on my vacation because she was so little. She wasnt sleeping through the night yet as it was and we were away from home, so we were away from her usual routine. I didnt get much sleep neither did she but everything was fine and we had a great time anyway. Your little one will be older so I think it will be fine. My little girl was sleeping through the night by 9 weeks so I hope  the same happens to you so you and your hubby can have a great time! Good luck!|`|W8xQKafjaa	you will be miserable and make most of the people trying to enjoy the hotel miserable around you. two months is dagerous because their little immune systems are not fully prepared yet and you will be exposing them to many diseases and bacteria floating in the air. Also if you were to have an emergency you would have to rush to a strange doctor that you were unfamiliar with. <br>  <br>  Plus they WILL be crying a lot, and you will be absolutley exhausted. Childbirth is a big deal, and its not something you can just walk off in a couple of weeks. it takes a long time to readjust.|`|URO3gDXcaa	don't make the kid suffer on the plane at that age, please.  or the others on the flight with you.  too early.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	It won't be much of a vacation because if you take the baby with you, you still won't get to relax and sleep.

56ed86847cc3626bd639dc7bf8a5a55eaa	Do you really need to post a question on here for this?! Unprotected sex, missed period... Hmmm I wonder what it could be!<br>  <br>  You need to buy a test honey.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Congratulations on the start of your new family.|`|koAaPXKQaa	You could be....When having unprotected sex, there is always that risk. Men have precum during intercourse before ejaculation, so there is always a chance. In future, if you don't want pregnancy, then i suggest you invest in some condoms or other contraception. They are not 100% either, but alot more reliable than withdrawl. I know some women will disagree with me on that though. Remember that condoms also protect you from STI's, so if this is a new partner, you should visit a clinic and have a full STI screen carried out. Not trying to give you a lecture, just trying to help.<br>  <br>  I suggest you wait a couple of days to make sure your period doesn't come, then if you have no luck with it, go to your GP and ask them to do a test for you. If you get the GP to do one intead of a home test, then you won't be forced to second guess the result, as i know alot of people do.<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	well done for becoming another statistic in the world of not having protected sex. get yourself to the doctor or even the free clinic and have tests done. there is a chance you would be pregnant but not anyone on here can tell you whether you are or arent for certain, a doctor needs to tell you that. you probably have an STD now too so well done!|`|8cDd70dSaa	"Withdrawal" is NOT a form of contraception...it's a form of stupidity.

miPubuDYaa	Completely normal. Your metabolism has speed up because your body needs fuel to create the placenta.<br>  <br>  Just eat if you feel hungry. When i was around 8weeks -16weeks. I couldn't stop eating. I would eat about 2 hours too. I would even get up in the middle of the night to eat a english muffin or something. <br>  <br>  If you are gonna eat an after dinner snack make sure its something on the healthy side. Chocolate pudding made with with real milk, cheese, a bowl of cereal with milk, even a fry egg with a slice of american and a piece of toast (only 240 calories but lots of protien)<br>  <br>  It should stop after the placenta is built and in place around week 12 - 16. Congrats on the pregnancy. :)|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I eat like that when I'm pregnant. You just have to be more careful what you are eating. Try to make the things you put in your mouth more nutritious and less calorie full or you could end up like me and gain 75 pounds (the first time I was pregnant). It's normal to want to eat every couple of hours while pregnant and many times they encourage you to as long as you are eating snacks and not full meals every couple of hours I wouldn't worry about it. Enjoy it now because towards the end of my pregnanciesies I always feel like there is no room for food because the baby has taken over every square inch.|`|Nux5S6oVaa	I'm 9wks- I've found I've had to eat smaller meals to deflect this.  I think it's normal to go from eating normally to eating more often. Just keep it in check, like I mentioned, eat smaller meals more frequently.  Yogurt and pudding are good snacks too.  Proteins will keep you fuller longer...and you are supposed to eat more protein for lunch and supper to keep you until morning.  It regulates your blood sugar.<br>  <br>  Your body needs time to adjust to being an incubator (my doctors exact words), and if sleeping and eating more help...then go for it.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I was eating all the time too! I wasn't eating a lot all at once but I was eating like small meals or snacks every hour or two. It would get so bad that I would be so hungry it would make me sick. It finally went away when I found out I had GD and was put on a strict diet.

KyFCYs0Yaa	I think nutritionally they are both the same. I usually used Gerber for my kids, but when I worked in a daycare, we used whatever the parents brought in. I never really thought about the difference before!<br>  I think it is yours and your baby's personal preference. If your baby seems to like one more than the other, go for that one! if he doesn't, go with whatever you like best.<br>  You can always compare nutrition facts too...maybe one has more vitamins than the other?|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	personally i feel beech nut baby foods are lesser quality than gerber, but the cereal might be OK.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I really like the Gerber.

(even if he thinks he doesn't like it or has tried it in the past) Make at least one thing that is a sure bet, something he will always or usually eat and the rest, make whatever you want. Don't plan the meals around what he will eat, this just enables his behavior. If he doesn't take two bites of everything on his plate, he doesn't get seconds of the thing he likes most. If he tries everything and doesn't like it, but wants seconds of what he did like, give it to him as a reward for his attempt at the other foods. It may also help if you let him help prepare the foods. My daughter (aged 7) made the family garlic bread to go with out pasta one night. She put the bread in the toaster, buttered it, added cheese and garlic powder. It tasted horrible, but she ate it because she was proud that she did it herself.

AA10927320	im glad you asked that that has been happening to me scince i was like 13 weeks i told the doctor said i was probably catching a cold or congested i was like whatever  only i felt dizzy for four 4hrs straight and puked 3 times and as u did i ate  i thought maybe my blood sugar is down nopw i ate breakfast then i ate a peanut butter sandwhich  and still so to be honest i guess  its just one of the many "perks" of pregnancy  that scares the crap out of ya  i would suggest taking it WAY EASY for the next two days hell order pizza for dinner  ever scince that day i never have felt like that anymore so i try not to think about it cuz it really did scare me i thought i was gunna just fall or black out|`|wTYh7DiSaa	It may be possible that you are anemic, seeing that the baby takes more than the 50% blood increase in our body. Should this happen again, you need to let your doctor know so he may prescribe you iron pills to counteract the anemia. This is especially important during the last trimester as it could pose a problem during delivery and bleeding.

Maybe get rid of the dog though because you shouldn't have to use your break at work to go take of a dog.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	well u can always move the wedding to a closer date so u can still fit in ur dress and all and have more time afterwards to prepare for the second baby. just make the wedding a little smaller, only close family and close friends, and when u guys have enough money, redo ur wedding on ur wedding anniversary or something and make it as big as u want to.<br>  <br>  u might need to just switch ur job to part time in towards the end of ur pregnancy to have enough energy to take care of ur baby and urself since it'll get harder to move around and all. see if ur work will allow u to get on part time for those last couple of months until u're ready to go back to full time.|`|7at1Hyn8aa	A few things to consider:<br>  Does it really have to be a big wedding? How about getting a civil ceremony with a small group of people.<br>  A part time job sounds about right, ask in your company, since you won't have much longer until you start showing anyway.<br>  Are you creative, artsy in some way?  How about taking a few hours a week now and start creating.  You can sell at arts and crafts shows in the area.<br>  <br>  One last thing, when I found out I was pregnant with my second child I panicked too.  It's normal.  In a few years you will look back and realize that things kind of just fell in place. It will all work out- trust me.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	well you've got a lot on your plate! are you saying you don't want the puppy anymore? they are very expensive...could you sell him/her? i know that sounds mean, but i had a dog for 11 years with my boyfriend (now dh) and its a big responsibility financially and it ties you down a lot and with a baby and another on the way and financial problems, i don't think keeping a dog is the best move....but thats just a suggestion.<br>  <br>  i worked my whole adult life till my son was born and then we decided i would rather raise my son then pay someone (the little i could afford) to watch him all day...so i've been a stay at home mom for almost 3 years and were pregnant with our 2nd....its do-able, you just have to 'both' want it and be willing to sacrafice 'wants' for 'needs'! we work together to save money. watch each others spending. we make financial plans for more than a month or so down the road....<br>  <br>  p.s. you can get married without having a big wedding. if you have a smaller wedding now, you can have a big 2nd wedding on your 5th anniversary or something, like a vow renewal...and it would be all the more special, cuz you didn't already do it.<br>  <br>  p.s.s.  i read a quote the other day that said...life is what happens while your making other plans.<br>  <br>  just for the record, to those of you who are sad and crying for days on end cuz your having babies instead of buying houses or paying off cc's......this is the best times of your life. DO NOT waste it being sad cuz of debt or that you don't have enough 'things'.  your children are far more important. yeah, vacations are fun and new cars are nice...but they are just things....they are not love or real happiness.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I have a 13 month old and am 24 weeks pregnant, meaning he was 8 or 9 months old when the new baby was conceived.<br>  <br>  I'm sure it will turn my house into a complete circus but we'll manage. Our dog is 2 but acts like a puppy so I can even relate in that regard :)<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll be fine. You may need to look at the cost of two kids in daycare under the age of 2 and determine if it is worth it for you to work outside the home or if you would just barely break even financially. If that was the case, staying at home may work better.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	When things are unplanned, they always seem overwhelming.  Sit down with fiance and do the math: cost of daycare for 2 kids+gas spent driving= less then you will make working.  If it would cost more for them to go to daycare then I suggest staying at home.  That's what happened to me and my hubby.  The cost of daycare for a 2 year old and a newborn is almost $1000 a month, $10 a day in gas driving to work/daycare + lost wages at least 2 times a month when one of them is sick and I have to stay home.  It just didn't add up.  If you stay at home you will be amazed and the ways you can save money!  Good luck!|`|mqF28wW3aa	Well, you might be worried & think everything is falling apart. but, everything will be alright. When you have the baby you won't regret anything. you will be happy & love the baby. try maybe hiring a babysitter to look after your children&dog. or finding some ways on the side to make extra money. After you settle down & get everything going good you can have a beautiful wedding, and your kids can be involved! :) don't worry, everything will be alright :D|`|sgPG1CL0aa	your what i call a life juggler and be assured that if you could do it first time round you can do it again. once the baby comes you'll know if you want to be a stay at home mumma or work part time.<br>  it all depends on what you want to do and can do.|`|252cdd0ece7a6accd8e7b6435bb1f209aa	Well, I'm sure my story will make you feel better! At the age of 19 I had my first daughter, Karoline. I got married to my husband of now 8 years as soon as we found out I was pregnant. He was 24. We moved in with his mom to save some money to get our life started.... It was tough but we were happy. When Karoline was 3 months old, I got pregnant.... We were happy still, but as you're feeling, freaking out! We named the 2nd one Karina! Now that they're 6 and 7, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way! By the way, we also got a puppy, but the girls were 2 and 3... I understand you're scared, and yes you will have to sacrifice a lot, it's a lot of hard work, and you will find that it's more work between you and your husband, not the kids! My girls are best friends! And the fact that they're so close in age actually helps a lot! They have the same interests and mentality and they're NEVER lonely! Trust me, it is a blessing in disguise.... They will always have a friend in each other, and on the weekends when your little one are playng in their room together, you and the hubby will be watchin' a movie! Congrats and good luck! PS: We no longer live with his mom...lol|`|8FyKz6gUaa	My husband and I have rented an apartment since 2 months before I became pregnant with our son. We had hoped to stay in this one bedroom very small apartment until we could buy a home. Unfortunately this could not happen we found a 2 bedroom very spacious apartment when our son was 6 months old. We decided we would be there till we could pay off our credit debt and buy a house (seems like a never ending process). Well two days after my 21st birthday (when my son was barely 9 months old) we found out I was pregnant again. Like you I was totally and completely (well just shy of not having sex at all while on birth control nuva ring) safe. I was absolutely crushed I want so badly to get ahead or atleast get to the point where I can say wow here we are just where we wanted to be the rest will come. I must have cried for 4 days straight so upset that I tried to do the right thing and well I guess there were different plans huh? Both my husband and I are still up in the air about what to do with the babies. My mother-in-law watches our son right now and while that helps us a lot she is 30 mins away from us and I live 5 mins away from my job and my husband is an hour away from his. So we spend alot in gas. Daycare is expensive... I think we have put off talking about this to each other so it doesn't cause any upsetting conversation. We are getting to the point where we can laugh about it and say we are excited but it is still a shock. I am 13 weeks pregnant and still don't know what to do. Staying home seems like its not an option but to actually sit down and discuss it would be nerve racking. If it wasn't for the credit bills we would be fine.... everyone has those thorns in there sides... If marriage is what you want then in any form would be great. I had a small ceremony and it was more beautiful that I would have ever imagined it and now given the chance of a bigger budget I would not have changed a thing. If a big wedding is what you truely want ... wait and make it perfect.. but let me just tell you, there will always be opsticals and a baby??? well lets face it theres never a right time I could think of a hundred things I would want to accomplish or have before it was the perfect time for one and now I will have two under 2. It will all work out for you just make sure you and your fiance are honest with each other about your feelings and try to enjoy the months ahead with out worrying too much. I wish I had some great idea for you but unfortunately I am still thinking myself. If you get any great ideas although budgets don't aways match I would love to hear them.... Just as worried and upset at you :(|`|cnIzqEoDaa	I had three babies by 23 (I'm 25 now). People think I'm crazy, but I love my life. You will find a way to make it work, babies are a blessing. We also have two dogs. I think having a big family is great! It can be trying, and there are hard moments but it is also fun and keeps your life full.<br>  <br>  Daycare is costly, so being a stay at home mom is a better fit for me. I go to school at night. You might consider seeing if your state offers child care assistance, if you're planning on working. Good luck with everything and congratulations.

AA12395149	Nothing, the concern is when an RH negative mom is pregnant with an RH positive baby.  The RH negative mom will receive a shot of RhoGam at 28 weeks and soon after delivery if it is found that the baby is RH positive.|`|UfB5cC1Iaa	Nothing. The RH factor is only a  problem if your RH - and the father is RH+ .

uFrqC4Y2aa	I had light spotting, I had blood tests done, and was told I had low progestrone. I took a supplement and it was okay. I suggest you get a different doctor. They should have taken blood tests to see where your hormone levels are and to see if your HcG levels are doubling every 72 hours. I would get pissed if my doctor said "only time will tell." Ask your friends if they like their doctors and see if anyone else is available.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	I am not saying this to scare u in any way I just wanted to give you my experience. I had a miscarriage this month. First off the pregnancy started off strange I had my period and THEN found out I was pregnant and the only thing that prompted me to take a test is when I called my Gyno about my unsual spotting they said take an HPT I took it and I was pregnant!! I was so happy as we had been trying for 13 months. Well my spotting continued and it turned into more like a full period then spotting. It wasnt pink it was red. I was concerned and went and gave blood to make sure the HCG levels went up. Will they dropped alot and my miscariage was confirmed. With all that being said my doctor told me spotting was common in early pregnancy and its just ur bpdy getting ride of old blood. Just take it wasy the next couple days put ur feet up and monitor the flow. I wish u the best!|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	It could be nothing or it could be something if you are really scared go to the ER and have them check it out. I know I started spotting at 5-6 wks and it started to get heavier I ended up with a miscarriage. I would go to the doctors just to be safe and to ease your mind. Its hard to say what is normal and what is not. Good Luck|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I wouldn't worry. I'm sure it's just spotting in early pregnancy. I didn't experience it but I know a lot of people that have. But like your doctor said, only time will tell. If you're not experiencing cramping with it then I'm sure you're fine. If you're really worried then go to the ER and they'll check you out.|`|50647166a1c6149a705c8d31016a70a2aa	Hi. I'm sorry you're scared, and I completely understand. I spotted during the first 6 months of my pregnancy and have a wonderful 18 month old daughter. The doctors never identified the cause of the spotting.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	I wouldnt worry about this bleeding yet, slight spotting in the first few weeks around the time your period would have been due happens alot. As long as u have no cramping or real red blood then try to keep calm!! Good luck :) xx
IPl3Yh1kaa	Looking at it from a purely objective point of view, a 7 month old does not physically need to eat at night. Their tummies can hold over until the morning. From a subjective point of view, some children enjoy their night feedings out of habit.<br>  <br>  No, he will not do this forever. but it is important to establish good sleeping habits for the both of you. When he wakes, try rocking or giving him the paci (if he uses 1, if not, that's ok to). The point of this is just to try to soothe him back to sleep without the assistance of food. After you've tackled that first feeding and have morphed it into a soothing session, go for the second one. Then gradually you can release both.<br>  <br>  I do not think letting him CIO is as emotionally scaring as some people say, more than likely the baby will not even remember it. But if it doesn't work for you, then it doesn't work for you. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aJLx0nhNaa	How easily does he go back down after eating?  Does he eat a lot and then go back to sleep easily?  If that's the case, I'd just keep feeding him at night.  He'll grow out of it.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I do not in anyway believe in the CIO method I hate it. It can be emotionally scaring to a baby. The only way that a baby can communicate is through crying and using that method will destroy that form of communication. Yes its totally normal for babies to wake up for feedings. Try play time before bed. We do this with my son who is 3 months old and he will sleep straight though the night. He is also as it turns out a tummy sleeper so we put him to sleep on his tummy. We do have a movement monitor since he is a stomach sleeper.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	There isnt anything you can do to MAKE him sleep longer.  If hes hungry, hes hungry theres nothing he can do to change that beside eat.  Yes its normal that he still wakes to eat twice a night, I know some moms whos 1 year olds still wake multiple times a night.  Every baby is different but CIO is NOT the way to make your baby sleep.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My seven month old still wakes up every 3-4 hours to eat. It's very normal for a child this young to still wake to eat. Give it more time.|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Some babies do not sleep through until they're much, much older. I know all the books say they're supposed to sleep through the night at roughly six months - but mine only just started and he's 17 months old! Well, touch wood, he hasn't woken up at night for the last 3 weeks,  so I'm optimistic.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the CIO method... I did it once or twice after he was a year old, and it didn't work. He falls asleep much faster and sleeps better when we sit with him in the room (5 minutes), than if I leave him to scream for hours. CIO does work for some babies, but just like any parenting method out there, you'll get babies who won't respond to it. <br>  <br>  And yes, my son still woke up to eat until he was a year old. Some babies just need that extra bit of milk to help them through the night.<br>  <br>  Try a good bed time routine, bath, milk, stories, cuddles, bed and see if it helps.<br>  <br>  My doctor also suggested an evening meal high in carbohydrates to help my son sleep a little better during the night. It did work, but it only meant he slept an hour or so longer before waking up for his milk.<br>  <br>  I know this is very hard. My son is hyperactive, and I cried a lot over this... nothing worked with my son. And he wouldn't just wake up to eat and go back to sleep. No, no, some nights he was up for hours on end to play. I was truly exhausted so I know how you feel. <br>  <br>  It WILL get better... just hang in there.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	You said "he's waking up 2 times a night to eat."<br>  <br>  He's not waking up for no good reason. If he's crying because he's hungry, the only way to stop it is to feed him. Make sense? <br>  <br>  It's normal for a baby to wake to feed (or for other reasons) until they are a year old, and sometimes longer. I guarantee your son will sleep through the night eventually, it just may be a while still. You should have seen sleepless nights coming when you decided to have a baby :)|`|c73QkZ2haa	CIO involves no contact by picking him up you shot all your work out the window....sry.. <br>  Rub his hand or his foot and sit in his room with him while you are doing the CIO it helps comfort him and you will know hes ok. Just move farther away from him each night until your out of the room. We did the CIO with our oldest and we stayed in room with her it took about a week and she only fussed for about 10 minutes each night maybe 15 at the most and she would go down to bed after that. No routine worked for us so this was our only option after her bath and story. I would say hes a little big for night time feeds but every baby is different.|`|DIZKlxNraa	My almost 9 month old son wakes up every 2-3 hours, sometimes even every hour:(. I think 2 times is not too bad and I tried CIO for my son also and it didn't work. I read "The no-cry sleep solution" book, but it didn't help me either. My son doesn't want to co-sleep, the routine does not help him sleep and putting him to bed drowsy but awake never puts him to sleep. Only nursing/rocking works.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	I tried the CIO method once and never again.  My twins threw up after 20 minutes of crying.  I sometimes offer them extra milk or a breastfeed.  Sometimes I just hold them and rock them to sleep.  My girls are 14 months old now and don't really have any major problems sleeping now.  They sleep for 10-12 hours night and have 1-3 hour nap during the day.|`|fQLeIAh1aa	some kids dont. there is a book call "NO CRY SLEEP SOLUTUONS" it covers everything! I had a co-sleeper that was 2 he was inhis own bed in his own room in a week! we tried crying it out, he vomited. i hope this helps!|`|4pXQxKMbaa	Are you sure that the reason he is waking up is to eat? Because you feed him every time he wakes up, his body has adjusted to that schedule and he will now continue waking up to eat then just because that's what you've trained him to do. Try rocking him back to sleep, giving him a pacifier, or just ignoring him and see if he goes back to sleep on his own. I can't say that it isn't normal for a 7 month old to continue to wake at night, all I can say is that my 4 month old has been sleeping through the night since she was 8 weeks old. Your baby's schedule is based on what you decide to do for him, and he will do what you train him to do, i.e.  eating at certain times, nap times, bed times, etc. CIO has never worked for me either, my daughter will hold out unless she is already almost asleep when we put her down.|`|6hA0O06xaa	Okay, I know you are looking for the answerer that wont yell at you and tell you you are a bad parent for trying the CIO method.  Here I am.  We used a modified Ferber method when my son was 8 months old because he was also still waking up 2-3 times a night to nurse.  I suggest reading the book by doctor Ferber so you really understand what you are doing.  The point is, you can't "give up" or all that crying was for nothing and the baby will not learn anything.  Also, you need to increase the intervals you leave him...we did much shorter intervals than the book suggests (thus the "modified").  try first 5 minutes, then 7 min., then 10 minutes and stick to 10 minutes the rest of the first night...You also may have to modify his nursing/bottles during the day so he is not feeding in order to go down for a nap.  We found out the issue was not hunger, it was an association with needing to nurse in order to sleep.  Some kids need to be rocked completely to sleep which is also tough when they wake up 2 times in the middle of the night...at 7 months, (or 8 in my case) the babies need to learn how to fall back asleep on their own.  After 2 or 3 days my son went down to only waking up once (at which point I would feed him if it had been at least 6 hours) and another 2 weeks before we saw a big improvement where he'd sleep 8 or 9 hours without feeding and fell asleep much more easliy at bedtime.  You have to be consistent (day and night) or the baby will only learn that if he cries long enough, mommy will come feed him.  You want him to learn to fall asleep without needing you.  read the book and be consistent.  good luck.
AA10624857	Around 4-8% of pregnant women develop Gestational Diabetes. So, most women who have elevated numbers with the 1 hour test (which is quite common) end up having test results come back in normal ranges from the 3 hour test. It is understanable to be worried, but it is helpful to know that even if you do develop Gestational Diabetes that you can still go on to have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. Gestational Diabetes can be managed with a specific diet given to you by a diabetes counselor which helps keep the carbohydrate intake consistent plus using a blood glucose monitor helps you keep those numbers consistent. Some women need to use insulin, but not all do. I had Gestational Diabetes with my 4th pregnancy. It did take some intentional attention to eating well and properly plus the finger pokes from the monitoring (I had to do it 4 times each day) weren't much fun, but I did go on to have a healthy baby. One of the things to watch for is babies growing too big which can lead to delivery problems, but I gave birth to my daughter at 41 weeks and she weighed only 6 pounds 14 ounces. Unless you have a case of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, after the baby is born, actually specifically after the placenta is expelled, then the Gestational Diabetes is gone. If you do have Gestational Diabetes you and your baby will have frequent prenatal visits and things will be monitored closely. I, too, was worried when I recieved the diagnosis, but once I started reading the literature from my doctor's office as well as talked with the diabetes counselor, I felt more confident that I could do what it took to ensure the health of my baby. I wouldn't worry too much as going in for the 3 hour test is pretty common as is having the test results come back normal.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Plenty of people fail the 1hr and pass the 3hr. <br>  <br>  There's not much to worry about either way. The whole reason for this test is to find out if you have GD early enough so that it can be treated in order to avoid issues. It's better to know that you have it than not.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Calm down.  I failed the one hour and passed the three hour.  Stressing about it won't help you.  Just relax, it will probably be fine.  I have no idea why I failed the first, but I did pass the second.  I was especially nervous as diabetes runs in my family, but I was fine.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	With my second pregnancy I failed the one hour test and then went on to pass the 3 hour.

I am not on any medication, just had to cut some sweets out.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yep that happened to me with my current pregnancy, the 1 hour test was abnormal and I did the 3 hour test and it came back normal.<br>  <br>  Either way don't worry, even if you had gestational diabetes your Dr. would advise you and it happens to plenty of people.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8U0Wtop2aa	Yes, I failed it 2 times and had to get the 3 hour one twice, it was while i was pregnant.

NRDfSktDaa	This is a pretty difficult question. Well one, you should make extra sure you deal with prenatal care. Teen pregnancies have a higher rate of birth risks- for you and the baby. Meaning you should eat right, take extra good care of yourself, and go to the doctor. That's very important you're now supporting someone else. Plus, no drinking,smoking, snorting, or anything! Clean,clean,clean you should be for the wee young baby! You also should tell your dad, he can help you. If you're in the church- they could help you. You also, should get your priorities straight. Make sure you know what you're doing. You're 9th/10th grade,right? So, you should know that most teenage mothers usually don't finish school. Finishing school is important, so you can go to college, and get better paid jobs. I'll be praying for you. You should watch out for your mental health. Postpartum depression affects women and some men after childbirth. Go and find other resources, books about your pregnancy, child raising, babies. If you know that you couldn't take care of the child- you should consider adoption. You can help make sure the baby will have a good future, you could even be a part of his life! Consider you education. Finishing would give you a chance of giving the babe a better chance. You can do online schooling to finish school at your own pace.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancy.org/</a><br>   Hopefully these links are helpful.<br>  <br>  Anymore questions could be asked to me.<br>  Hope it helped.|`|b07a55809ce6590e58989ad13b01b89aaa	What a terrible situation it is, i would suggest you to speak to your mother about it, be honest to her or tell your daddy if you feel more comfortable with him, just share it with an elder person, abortion can harm you badly but i think you should keep the baby if you want only if your parents are fine with that.<br>  <br>  Take care of your health and good luck, leave that fcking pervrt he only  used you|`|ZAcfOrNbaa	First of all, don't go telling your dad the whole thing about you being scared he would "rape" you. I'm sure your dad would get a kick out of that one, just like i did. Hahahahah. Second, if you were big enough to even put yourself in that situation then you are big enough to tell your dad that you're pregnant. Third, enjoy mine and tons of other people's taxes.|`|9rZINwbpaa	Girl, You need a big smack upside the head.|`|GUVl3KiYaa	ha, he probably thought u were flirting. def. not rape. but the guy always lose. go for it.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	1. Tell your father. Of course he'll be really upset. He can help you get through this regardless.<br>  <br>  2. Go to the police if it was rape. If you are just calling rape because he's being a jerk, do not waste your time or the polices resources.<br>  <br>  3. You can keep the baby. I don't know how well off your family is financially, but they could help. You could also try the state for aid. Get child support from the baby's father.<br>  <br>  4. Realize that should you either choose to keep or adopt the baby, the father has some say. If he chooses not to give up his parental rights (assuming you put his name on the birth certificate) it can hinder any proceedings in an adoption.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Can you give this kid a good life when your not even legal to drive? As early as you are the pill abortion would be a good option, but If you are set against it, have you thought about adoption? You should be scared because not only do you have to deal with the stresses of motherhood you have to deal with the stress of being a teen.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	you can prob get him for rape, but you didn't even try to stop him. so that really isn't fair to him. don't punish him because you are just as guilty. <br>  you have to tell your dad, so you might as well get it over with. he's going to find out sooner or later & it'll only be worse if he finds out from someone else|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	If you're mature enough to have sex and get pregnant, you are mature enough to stand up and tell your father. The sooner you tell him the better.  Telling a bunch of random people that you're pregnant and not your parents is stupid. Are those friends going to support you when the  baby comes???? I doubt it!  Are those friends going to take you to all the doctor's appointments that are needed? Probably not!  Will most of those friends be around after the baby is born? Most likely not. But guess who will be there. The one person you're to scared to tell. Will he be mad. DUH. But he will get over it and be there for you.<br>  <br>  An age gap of 2 years in most states is not rape. The state i'm in for a minor to be charged with statutory rape is 4 year age gap. But if you said no and he forced himself onto you then yes it's rape. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you need a break from guys. To get your own life in order. You are going to become a parent. And sounds like you have a lot of growing up to do.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Okay, since most of the answers above me aren't really answering your question or helping you, I'll give it a shot.<br>  <br>  First, you HAVE to tell your dad. If you don't want an abortion, he's going to find out and the longer you wait, the more angry he'll be.  He might not even be angry. His reaction could surprise you.<br>  <br>  Second, keep attending the Planned Parenthood. It will help you.<br>  <br>  You probably can't say that he raped you though, because it's technically legal for you two to "do it" as long as one of you is not over 18. Plus, you are partially responsible- you should have called the police.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you need anything else and I'll be sending you all my love and support.|`|AA12069058	Sorry but pressuring you is not rape. Rape is physically holding you down and forcing you. But first off I would like to say that I completely respect you for your decision to keep your child. It may seem hard now, but one day you will be overjoyed with the decision you made to keep YOUR baby. As for telling your dad, I would try to see if there is anyway you can prove to him that you are willing to face the challenges up ahead. Once you can gain his confidence, I would tell him then. Just have faith in your own decision and you will come out on top. Good Luck?|`|bAKbAKdzaa	actually, it IS considered rape. he's legal and you're not. in the law's eyes, that's rape. and if you said no before even if you did give in afterwards, it still wasnt' consent. you're not old enough to give consent  yet. <br>  <br>  anyway, i'm glad you didn't go for the abortion. you made a big mistake and you can't just punish the life of that child because it's not convenient. if i were you i'd give it up for adoption. you really can't provide for a baby at this point in your life. and you will most likely not finish high school. i'm 17 and a senior in high school. i was in your shoes about 4 months ago. i didn't know what to do. and i didn't want to tell my parents. unfortunately, i lost the baby. but i had decided on what i was going to do. if you don't think you can live without knowing your baby, i'd say open adoption. giving that baby up would be the hardest thing you'd ever have to do. but it would also be the most selfless act. it would show your love for that baby and wanting it to have a better life than you could provide. however, if it would be too hard for you to give the baby up and have them know you, then closed adoption.<br>  <br>  hun, you're only 15. you need to think about your life and the baby's life. what kind of life is your child going to have if you keep it? if you need to talk, you can contact me through my profile. i know what you're going through. and it's a very hard thing. but, you really need to think about what's  best for your child. and adoption might be the best way to go.<br>  <br>  good luck with whatever you do.<br>  <br>  [xoxo]<br>  <br>  jessica mae|`|uly3aFqtaa	First off, I would like to say that you can get through this :)<br>  God will never give you a problem that you can't overcome!<br>  <br>  Shame on them for talking you into Abortion; they should only be allowed to list some options and leave the personal decision up to YOU.<br>  <br>  Yes, that is counted as Rape, regardless of whether it was under consent or not. And yes, under your circumstances it was Rape [Regardless of your age!].<br>  <br>  You need to tell Planned Parenthood that you do NOT want an Abortion. It's ridiculous that they're 'telling' you to. Psshhh.<br>  <br>  You pretty much have three options right now:<br>  <br>  1. Abortion. As you said, you don't want one. You do not NEED to get an abortion, but it's the option you have to terminate the Pregnancy. I personally am against Abortions.<br>  <br>  2. Keep the baby. You will hold the baby full-term and bring it up yourself.<br>  <br>  3. Put your baby up for Adoption. This is probably the most logical thing to do, because you are not harming anyone in any way - actually you are giving another family the oppertunity to have a little miracle!<br>  <br>  The choice is completely up to you. I'm going to say that sooner or later you will have to tell an Adult; it's the hard truth. Don't expect it to be easy, it really won't. Even though your parents might get angry, it doesn't mean they don't love you [your Parents will ALWAYS love you with all of their heart], they will probably just be very concerned and worried for you.<br>  <br>  You have a good head on your shoulders; do what you feel is best!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Xx.
ESQ5hriGaa	nope, that happened to me about the same time.  If you are worried or it lasts longer than your period you can call your doctor or hospital.  There is a chance it could be that you are doing too much and the bleeding is starting up again but chances are it is just your period.  Congrat's on the baby!

KDNWFuZWaa	Due to where we live I buy shopping for a month, tinned, packets, dried, cereals, rice, pasta,flour etc all meat stuffs to get frozen. The only things I buy weekly are bread milk and whatever we run out of at the local shop. for the 5 of us I normally spend a total of ￡600 per month including top ups at the little shop. It is not a lot for 5 people when worked out over the month.<br>  I normally get the shopping done and that weekend also mass cook. trays of lasagne, pots of soup, chilli, macaroni cheese, vegetable bakes, pizza dough, all pies with out pastry and cakes and biscuits all food stuff gets frozen so it can be heated just like a ready meal in the microwave so it saves a lot of time over the month, it also saves a lot of money not having to use the cooker every night.<br>  Make a list of what you actually need for the week/month. plan your meals in advance so you know what you will be buying, stick to the list. don't go shopping on an empty tummy as you are more likely to buy more food than you need.<br>  look else where and compare prices you might have a walk between shops but it could save a good bit of money. take advantage of special offers only on things you use, bulk buy them. If you have friends who go shopping different nights or family members get them to pick up certain things for you so you are not tempted to get things you don't need. It's hard work but looking about and slighly changing ways of shopping can really make a difference for your pocket.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I am not normally a stay at home mom but for health reasons during this pregnancy, my doc has put me off work until delivery in June sooooo...I feel like one :)<br>  <br>  I go every week since I have the time. I like it because I can get fresh veggies/deli products/fruits on a weekly basis rather than buy them every two weeks and have them be not so fresh once I get almost to the point of needing to shop again.<br>  <br>  You can also make specific lists and stick to them unless something is on sale for a really good price, because who doesn't take advantage of that :)<br>  <br>  Say for example you budget 200 for groceries every two weeks. Use a hundred a week. keep it in a little envelope in your undie drawer so you don't spend it on anything else and while you're at the shop just keep a mental tally in your head of how much everything costs that you put in the cart. Round up each item and you'll pay a little less than you expected at the checkout.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|TrVJkGUmaa	Ive just recently had a new baby, and i found that what i was spending before the baby was way too much.

jaP0TANdaa	The stretch cervical mucus is definitely a sign of ovulation and paired with the shaper pains I'd guess that you did in fact ovulate around the 20th, which would put you at ovulating around CD16. However, if you really are ovulating at that point in your cycle (a little late, most ovulate around CD14, but not too bad) and your cycles only last 25-29 days, there could be a problem with your luteal phase. You need at least 10 days in your luteal phase (but most doctors want to see at least 12) to successfully conceive. So, the 21st was 1 DPO for you... if AF shows any sooner than March 4th, you could have a luteal phase problem. Right now you're only around 3 DPO, so it's highly unlikely that you have any pregnancy symptoms. You usually won't get any symptoms until a few days after implantation. Implantation happens around 7-10 DPO and some women can get a positive HPT as soon as 10 DPO (for you that would be around March 2nd). But, it's really best to wait until the first day of your missed period to get the most accurate results. Good luck to you!|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	i wouyld wait as long as you can towards your missed period but i know the wait is hard so maybe a a week or 2. it does sound like your were ovulating so be prepared for a possible positive test.
HUQQzph2aa	Take him for a day trip, maybe to the zoo or aquarium. Another idea is to a show, Disney live or the Circus.|`|AA10930947	My son will be 2 on April 14th I always make my kid's birthday cake this year I'm making him a 3 d standing teddy bear cake and I'm just having a little party I have come to realize kids that age only care about the sweets they get to eat. One year I made my daughter an ocean cake and for a treat I made these cookies I had blue icing on them then created turtles out of hershey swoops and marshmallows I love doing things like that you don't have to throw him anything extravagant yet.|`|M1TgnTR6aa	make him king for a day.castle cake!and get him a crown.take alot of pictures and make him a scrapbook.why not take him somewhere where there is alot of other kids for him to play with?like chuck e cheese??|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Skip the chuck e cheese. It's over priced and germy from kids taking diapers off in ball pits that they don't clean and other issues. EW. There isn't much a 2 year old can do there anyway.<br>  <br>  Have a family party at home and then take him to something he is interested in. If he likes animals, a zoo or children's petting farm would be good.  If he likes to get hands on, find a children's mueseum near you that has a wide age range and take him there.  If he likes circus things, see when a circus will be near you, get tickets.<br>  <br>  My son is also turning 2 this year and we're in the same boat. We just moved after the holidays to be closer to where my hubby works. All my son's little playmates are now 2-3 hours away and it's not exactly easy for them to come that far for a kids party.  He'll have a few kids around, but mostly family.    We're just doing a party at home with family and the people we know and keeping it smallish this year. We'll probably take him somewhere fun the following weekend to let him explore and have some special fun for his interests and what he likes. <br>  <br>  See about a play group in your area and get involved.  That way he can interact with other kids and meet some pals his own age.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	zoo or park just so he is loved set up a play group fo rhim to get involved <br>  good luck !! happy bday little man

Even if she is never a morning person she will get easier to handle as she becomes older and more independent.  Try not to stress too much, the calmer you stay the easier it will be to calm her.

8t8NjjnVaa	I serioulsy think that having a baby and then the exhausting task of taking care of a newborn fries half your brain cells.<br>  <br>  I have a great memory, but after I had my first, I was such a ditz!  It wasn't until she was about a year old that I began to feel 'normal' again.  <br>  <br>  I think this happens to pretty much all moms, don't worry about it.  Just apologize for your forgetfulness and go on about your day.  Adults will understand, especially if they have children of their own.<br>  <br>  You might want to explain your forgetfulness to a student by telling them that life with a new baby is very exhausting and apologizing to them.  That's all your really can do!  <br>  <br>  But you're normal :)|`|OBU1eDUHaa	"New mom brain" syndrome is quite common.  It is preceded by "prego brain" syndrome.

There is no cure until your children are old enough to sleep through the night, pee on their own, and make their own bowel of cereal in the morning!  Just kidding about the cure though.  I know what you mean.  I can't even remember the phone number to the place I work.  My husband will tell me/ask me something and 5 minutes later I will answer.  He gives me the weirdest look and tells me I already answered him 5 minutes ago!  It's because you have SO much on your mind!  Good luck!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Just make the "new mom brain" excuse.

mjd1qjy7aa	It is almost two weeks ago when my 3rd daughter was born. My husband was with me the first night and the two girls were with their grandparents. It is nice to have him around and focus on just the two of us. We watched tv and laughed til 3am. I had my sister stayed the second night so my husband can get the place ready when we get home.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	My son was only 19 months old when my daughter was born. I didn't get to the hospital until 1 am, so we had my parents come stay at our house with him. That was early tuesday morning. He spent tuesday night with my in laws, and I came home wednesday afternoon. He was a little off schedule, mainly due to my father in law! (he gives him absolutely everything he wants, whether it is good for him or not!)<br>  You will be okay in the hospital alone. If you get stressed out with the new baby, you can always send him to the nursery and try to get a couple of hours of sleep. <br>  But, you could always have someone stay at your house with your son. That might be easier on him! also have a schedule written out and posted on the fridge for the Big day!|`|eiB9ntcKaa	i was required to have a c-section for our 2nd son. our 1st son was only 17 months old at that time i was due with our 2nd. i was a nervous wreck deciding what to do about my hospital stay, i didnt want to leave him,  but we decided to have our mother in law fly out and stay with our 1 1/2 yr old at our house. my husband was able to stay with me in the hospital, and we were able to bond with the new  baby. i really loved that time i had with my husband, both of us getting to know our little new guy. besides the fact of being in a hospital at all! our fist son was a little angry at us when he saw us, they came to visit in the hospital, but things were back on track in a few days and he didnt hold a grudge.he had so much fun with grandma, and his schedule was off when the new baby came home anyway. it worked out great|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My husband stayed in the hospital with me until a short while after the baby was born.  My son was with grandma.  Our niece (who was living with us) was with my sister.  <br>  <br>  After baby was born at 1:30am, dad went home about 2:30 & slept til morning.  Then, he went to get son from grandma & came to spend the day with us at the hospital, going home at night with our son (and niece came to sleep at home that night, too).  <br>  <br>  It may have been nice to have dad there overnight, to help with baby (I had c-section, so I had surgery recovery to do, too).  But, the hospital staff did a great job coming in to help me when needed overnight.  And, it was good for our son to have things back to 'normal' as soon as possible.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	My kids are 9yrs apart. So when I had my daughter last September, my son handled it fine. He was worried a bit but because I was in the hospital for a week. I had a cesarean, with both children. I went into labor during the middle of the night so my husband stayed with me from the time we got there (around 3am) to about 6pm the following day. But he didn't stay with me that night. My son had already left with my mother, who had come to see the baby. I was in pain but not so much where I wasn't able to move around or do for the baby. My week long stay was because my blood pressure wouldn't stay down but my pain had subsided in 2 days and I only used percoset that first day. My husband stayed home with the my oldest so he didn't have to miss school. So, in my opinion, you will be more than fine if you're there alone. You don't actually need anyone with you since this is your 2nd child. While I was in the hospital, I used that uninterrupted week to get to know my daughter and let her get to know me. I had to get used to having a daughter because I had been geared towards my son and things that boys do and like. There was a mental preparation I had to undergo. Maybe you can use the lone time getting to know your daughter. Dad and big brother will have their turn soon enough.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Its only one night. Its not a big deal. Your husband will get over it. You should be fine to stay alone after the first night. You have a call button so if you need some thing the nurse will come in. Having this baby is more important then disrupting your son and husband's routine.|`|AA11637393	I think you have it right.  The first night you will need your hubby.

Ot8lxaMEaa	Breastmilk warms up the most easily if you store it in storage bags and then put the bag in a bowl of warm water. It goes much faster than in a bottle, probably twice as fast. Lansinoh sells decent priced pre-sterilized bags. Not sure about the bottle warmer and breastmilk. I think it is designed for formula and might destroy some of the properties in breastmilk? That would be my thought on it, you could contct the manufacturer and see what they say.
AA12395149	I'm sure if it tastes good, but some women experience what is called pica.  It's when they have an intense craving for non-food items like dirt, clay, laundry starch, etc.  The craving is so strong that they actually eat it.  It is believed that the craving comes from a lack of minerals in their diet, but nothing is concrete (I wonder if people try to eat concrete).  Pica is not something reserved just for pregnant women, anyone can experience it.<br>  <br>  My question is, if they've never eaten it before, how do they know that's what they crave??  What makes think, "hmm...I want something to eat, I'll try a fist full of dirt"|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Ewwwww no.  It's really NEVER normal to like eating dirt, paint, wood, etc.<br>  <br>  Usually these cravings are caused by some deficiency - are you eating enough?  Do you get enough raw fruits and veggies?<br>  <br>  Contact your doctor and see if he can put you on a better pre-natal vitamin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|EnCbkStYaa	hello..<br>  <br>  if you want read something about healthy,pregnancy question,or sign about pregnancy..<br>  i come just accross this blog : <a href="http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogsp...</a> which may help you.|`|V2iRZysgaa	Yes, see most pregnant woman have no control over what they eat.  Just make sure your fingers are out of the way when they snack...|`|0YTuN71aaa	If by dirt you mean anything you cook, then the answer is "no".|`|TtTMh4xKaa	no but dirt smells good.. LOL|`|YyX0EJDRaa	I've seen sone itching to eat the dirt and others actually eating it. Its not good for your health-stay away from it , whether pregnant or not.|`|79eRDIbXaa	Yuk Um noooooo not for me thanku|`|rC6gL7KOaa	No it doesn't taste good but for some pregnant women, their bodies crave the taste of dirt. My doctor said it means that their body is lacking a certain type of vitamin or nutrient.|`|00X4m7vjaa	ha ha im 12 weeks and nothing taste good to me! at all. it all taste like dirt if anything! and its all nasty.|`|K1iUzewyaa	nope, but if that is the case, I would say its a boy.. added testosterone..|`|BcjFssaEaa	i dont know i never wanted to eat it lol<br>  xxx
85bf9affa8a14cf017087b756bc02b72aa	i guess in order to get child support you do need his name :(<br>  maybe he will bond with your baby after he or she is born.<br>  i understand where u are coming from, because i had my fathers last name(now i have my husband's last name) and i always hated having my fathers name because he was never there for me.<br>   i truly hope he will be a dad and support you. <br>  i dont judge you for getting pregnant but i really admire you for NOT getting an abortion. U are a strong girl and I am sure that even if that jerk dont stick around, u are gonna be a great mom and your baby will never even miss having a dad. thats what happened to my mom. she was my mom and dad.<br>   so answering ur question... if u need child support u will have to give his last name, but if you dont wanna have to deal with him at all just give your last name to your baby.|`|2GXgT981aa	Use your last name.  If he decides to come back you can always change it later, but that seems pretty unlikely to me.  I think it would be easier on the child to have the same last name as the parent he/she lives with.<br>  <br>  As for child support, I really don't know.  I'd go ahead and put it on the birth certificate, but I don't think that means you have to use his last name.  Think of those men who have children with multiple women, the kids all probably have their mother's last names.  If you at least put his name on the certificate, then if your child decides later in life he wants to know his father, it'll be easier to find him, you know?|`|HdOVYIWjaa	i don't think you would have to use his last name for the baby to get child support, but make sure you put his name on the birth certificate, I think that's what will determine whether or not he has to provide child support, and if it comes to it, a DNA test will prove that's he is the baby's father anyway.|`|jj3L6MDgaa	Just use his last name. He may have been a jerk, but the child will probably want to feel like he/she has some connection to his/her father. If they don't who the father was as a person, they won't know he is a horrible guy and they will want to feel that they are connected to him in some way and aren't just unwanted. Do you kind of see what I'm saying? I hope this helps you make this tough decision.|`|wEEOvu5Waa	Pfffft! Use your own! If he really walked out on you and your baby then he doesn't deserve the honor of giving a child his last name. Give him/her your own last name.|`|NvJzUipvaa	The assh*** who walked out's because a real assh***<br>  I mean, really<br>  Spaceballs censored version|`|v6Ihgewqaa	Use your last name (:<br>  <br>  and you don't have to use his last name if you don't want to<br>  <br>  and I'm not sure about the child support name thing|`|uV54p794aa	You can name the baby using your last name, and still list him as the father. That'll work just fine :) gl! & congrats!|`|k5sH7ryLaa	you dont have to i would put your own this happend to my sister and she got ditched and she keep her name so i would leave yours or youll regret it one day|`|AA10051476	DON'T DO IT, USE YOURS!!!! I MESSED UP AND DIDN'T, AND HAD TO GO THROUGH ALL THE BULL OF CHANGING MY DAUGHTERS NAME!! DO NO DO IT!!!|`|bKDBbGmuaa	put the dad as Alex grace definitely|`|ugaIZSjuaa	if you are not married you dont have to use his last name but if its for his kid im not sure about that|`|AA12124973	please use your last name, trust me from experiance|`|AA10541783	one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made was giving MY wonderful, beautiful boys their "sperm donor's" name...i was not even with him any longer when i had my youngest and i still gave him his name and i regret it terribly! but the choice in the end is yours............good luck!<br>  <br>  o and i'm almost positive you'll need his name on the birth certificate and if he constests it they'll give him a paternity test!<br>  <br>  congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IFqY2w1Paa	You can use whichever last name you feel comfortable with. Traditionally, a child takes the father's last name. If you don't feel comfortable with that, then that's your choice. Good luck and congrats on your little miracle. =)|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Use yours - that's completely fine. It's up to the parent what last name is used, regardless of whether the father's name is on the birth certificate or not.|`|ImolGwDPaa	Your last name.  He's gone, out of the picture.  There's no reason to put his name.  Good luck!|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	You should use your last name without thinking twice.|`|VOxZ2dt2aa	use your own obviously|`|ww3ukbdVaa	no, screw him. put your own name|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Hey there,<br>  I'm 21, single and using MY LAST NAME. He already signed that he was the father at medi-cal. They force child support. He's been gone in Oakland then colorado. Now only the good Lord knows.<br>  <br>  You should use your last name, it will benifit you in the future, if he is like my baby's father. Good luck!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You do not have to use his name for the baby's last name or even yours for that matter, you could pick whatever you want, but you do have to put his name on the father's spot if you want child support.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	use your last name. and if it is really a big deal to your child later on in life, (which i probably wont be), your child can have it legally changed later.|`|cO6BD3hVaa	If you're a single mother-to-be you would use your last name on the birth certificate for the child.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	put him on the birth certificate for child support<br>  but use your own last name..for sure<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|XqqLlBe4aa	use your last name on the birth certificate.|`|dpHi3T4xaa	use a good last name|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	what ever name sounds the best!!
02KmVVvZaa	YES deffinately tell. he disrespected you, your BF and your mate. what he did was wrong. this may hurt your friend but its better that it comes from you and not his date. he could say that you kissed him. <br>  <br>  please tell, your mate needs to know.|`|Hpp26zQjaa	YES, you SHOULD. He should have NEVER and I repeat NEVER done that just for respect of you and your boyfriends relationship.|`|4HvuxHPoaa	YES you should tell! They may be protective but they need to know!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yes, wonder if he has a STD?|`|iojRLiBGaa	Of course you should tell.<br>  This isn't just you that could get hurt.<br>  This guy kissed you, and he's claiming to be gay, it'll break your friends heart. Tell.
m001xWWKaa	My husband and I have also been ttc for 2 years. He has IBS as well. We have been lucky that my OBGYN was very proactive and started testing us after only 8 months. <br>  <br>  My OBGYN looked up the medicine my husband takes daily for his IBS  (basically prescription strength Imodium) and found no links to infertility.  So I think you are safe there.<br>  <br>  Your husband will first need to give a sperm sample to see what the numbers are and the motility. If they are low your doctor will probably have him visit a urologist to see if there is any kind of blockage.  <br>  <br>  Has your doctor talked to you also about whether or not you are ovulating? Or if there might be a blockage in your tubes? <br>  <br>  I am learning that there are so many reasons why couples have trouble conceiving and these are just some of the tests I have had done.  <br>  <br>  In our case he has bad sperm and I don't ovulate on my own. We are in our second round of In Vitro Fertilization....hoping for a positive pregnancy test in the next few weeks!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and if you haven't talked with your Obgyn yet..make an appointment! No need to wait any longer!|`|XTf9VaLoaa	ibs medication can b affect it i have heard chilcken pox at a late age can also but i kno some that was born with 1 testicle fully dropped n the other not n he has jst had a baby good luck x
532XA7lkaa	I had morning sickness really early the first time, my son is now 4, and it started at 6 weeks.  This time, I am 15 weeks along, I thought I made it in the clear...but then at about 10 weeks I got it and worse than the first time.  I was in the hospital getting IV fluids and anti-nausea meds it got so bad.  Thank God it's over now...at least I hope!  I still feel nauseous and like I could throw up lots of days, I just control it and eat small until I feel better.  I'm so used to throwing up anymore, it doesn't scare or worry me...because I always feel better after I do.  I used to be terrified of throwing up and would do anything to avoid it...but this time...I had no choice.|`|3ggolLgQaa	Sorry I have never been pregnant before but I just wanted to say <br>  CONGRATULATIONS!<br>  <br>  I think pregnant women are amazing!<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Cnt wait to have a baby some day!
AA12202431	Look for increased urination, painful, soreness, or Swollen breasts, extreme exhaustion, nausea etc. <br>  <br>  Those are the main symptoms. But it sounds pretty good that you made the right time period.|`|YzUPmWTBaa	Yup, it sounds like it was implantation cramping and that you are indeed pregnant. Even the faintest positive, is a positive! Congrats mommy! :)

AA12069058	Your not pregnant. If it was a week ago and you still had your period there is not chance of pregnancy. And even though there is an EXTREMELY slim chance of a period while being pregnant, it would just not happen this early after you've had sex. Good Luck?|`|nKSmgjylaa	0.001%<br>  Period = No baby.<br>  Be more careful, you migh't be so lucky next time.|`|BUOJJpaCaa	You are too late for the morning after pill at this point.<br>  There is a very small chance (something like .01% chance) that you are pregnant while you are on your period.<br>  If you are really that worried, take a pregnancy test or talk to your OB/GYN and they can do a blood test and check.|`|clc6qQDAaa	0.01% chance . If there was no *** then theres no way you can get pregnant. If your that worried get yourself on the pill or just dont have sex.|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	I don't think you could be pregnant. When you are pregnant you don't have periods.
vue9NOhYaa	How old is she?  <br>  <br>  She doesn't need rice cereal, and it's quite obvious that she isn't yet ready for solids. If she WAS ready, she would be interested and open her mouth.  So, forget about it. Wait a few weeks, or a few months (if she's under 6 months, most sources would recommend against giving solids this early anyway), and, when she seems interested, try again.<br>  <br>  (When you do, you don't have to give rice cereal. She might like fruits or veggies better.)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Do NOT put it in her bottle, or play 'airplane games.'  She should eat because she's hungry, not beause you're forcing or tricking her.|`|xGI9z01Maa	Add a bit to the bottle but you have to have a bigger nipple so that she can get use to it.  Also, try adding milk and not water.  Let her play with the spoon.  On the other hand, if she is not having issue with sleep or taking to many bottles, then she might not be ready.  <br>  <br>  Or she could be like my youngest child who refused all baby food especially the rice cereal and only wanted to eat what we were eating.  She was born at the end of March and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us.  It was a pain to cut up everything and not be able to open a jar but she a health also most 8 year old now.|`|UghJ0XROaa	There is not much i can tell you to help, except it sounds like she is not ready. Stop trying and try again in the next week or so.<br>  <br>  EDIT-just being 5 1/2 months doesn't mean that she is ready, my nephew is 8 months old and he just now started showing interest in eating solid food, there is no reason to attempt to force her to eat.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	She's probably not ready.  Give it a couple of weeks and try again.  There's no hurry.|`|deIzFnV8aa	So I haven't actually tried these ideas yet, just things I have heard.<br>  <br>  Mix in breastmilk or formula (whatever you usually use) so it tastes more familiar<br>  <br>  Mix in some pureed fruit (or fruit baby food) to make it taste better (sounds like something you aren't supposed to do, but I def know several people who have, and one of them is a pediatrics nurse)<br>  <br>  Start off feeding her with your finger - put some food on the tip of your finger and put it in her mouth (I hear that this has worked for several people I know - it might be a good place to start. then when baby is more used to the food, she can get used to the spoon).<br>  <br>  let her play with the spoon or just put it in her mouth empty to get her used to it.<br>  <br>  offer the cereal in the morning when she is more alert and less tired/fussy<br>  <br>  Personally I think the finger idea sounds worth trying; we are starting DD on ceral next month (why people have been talkign to me about this), and I think we might skip the spoon completelly at first.|`|diEZW57caa	I don't blame her for not opening her mouth, have you ever tasted that junk? It's, as my daughter says, "ku-kee"<br>  <br>  How old is she? You might be trying too soon.  My little one started eating food early because she started picking it up and eating it, there was no spoon feeding involved.  I believe babies are ready for food when they can pick it up and feed themselves.|`|sJIui9Hraa	My son has recently started on baby rice, he didn't take the spoon at first so i decided to put some on my finger for him, he tasted it, then i did the same thing again but before he took my finger in his mouth i swapped it for the spoon and hes taken the rice off the spoon since|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	make a game out of it, i used to play here comes the plane with my son, hold the spoon and say, open up the runway here comes the airplane, worked everytime|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Generally I think that means they are not ready for solids...but maybe you have a stubborn little one.  I would keep offering.|`|723QHuicaa	what age is she?<br>  <br>  <br>  Im not surprised she wont take it, have you tasted it? bleugh!<br>  <br>  If she is 6m, chop up some soft fruits or veg, put them in front of her and allow her to feed herself by hand.
qCe9Pnlgaa	You can take the test on the day AFTER you miss your period. I know it stinks to have to wait, but just try to think of something else. I think it's bad luck to do the test too soon. I've done that and ended up not being preg. In January, I decided to just not worry or think about it, and guess what?! Pregnant!!! But I had to wait until the day after I missed my period. Good luck!!!|`|wnYn7tegaa	i would wait until the day your period is late, i tried doing pregnancy tests of all brands as me and my partner where desperate 2 become pregnant but they were all saying negative...its only when i fainted and was taken to hospital i was told i was already 6weeks pregnant...<br>  <br>  if you worried try going doctors as there tests are by far the most effective and the earliest to tell..|`|cnIzqEoDaa	You can take a test but if it's negative, you're still going to be wondering. Maybe just buy a two pack and take one now, one later. Any brand will work. The Dollar Tree and Dollar General Store tests are supposed to be as accurate as the expensive brands.|`|tXfMArb6aa	I would wait at least until the week before my oeriod was due to come or even the week after being that you hcg levels are much higher also look for the warning signs like breast tenderness, nausea, and just plain old tired.|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	Wait until you miss your period.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Wait until week 3 and take a first response early results their good but buuy a two pack because unless you miss your period the test can be inaccurate so if its negative and your period doesnt show take test #2.|`|bf6c8c12038a0925b13989b7791d0d0caa	I would wait for the 3rd week.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	If you are on a 28 day cycle, then your af would be due 14 days after conception so taking a test now would be accurate. If you are on a longer cycle, then you should still be close to af being due and if you use a First Response or early detection test then you should still get an accurate answer. If it comes up negative then wait until af is late and test again.|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	Mine didn't show positive till 2 weeks AFTER my missed period, and I had went to planned parenthood a week before that and it was still negitive!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	take a test about a week before your period is due.....and any work fine...i used first response|`|NroZQN5vaa	Wait until you miss your period. That's the best time.
SVqjzEE3aa	it could be the side affects....and the commercial said that if yoru period doesn't come then you might be preggo.....|`|7at1Hyn8aa	I think you just got sick with the flu, or some other stomach bug. <br>  Did you get your period after you took the plan B?  <br>  If not, mention that too, if you see your doctor.|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	Yes, you can.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I think you are fine! If you are still worried and you miss your perid then take a test. Good luck!|`|vi0QoTq1aa	all those sound like Plan B pill side effects...<br>  It is just a stronger dose of the regular pill,  a lot of hormones.  you can even bleed, but don't worry.<br>  If you were on the time in the cycle where you could have gotten pregnant then you still have another 10 days until you find out whether you are getting your period or not.<br>  but be aware that the plan B pills might also affect your regular cycle, so just drink lots of water and eat well so that you are not weak, try to stay calm as stress will affect your cycle too.<br>  if in 2 weeks you don't get your period I will suggest you go for a blood pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Plan B pills are usually too strong for you to still be pregnant but there is always a 0.01% probability that you could...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|R7sjdRi2aa	what is plan B. be explicit to get the right anwer please|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes. PlanB isn't 100 effective. <br>  <br>  However, headaches and fevers aren't common early  symptoms of pregnancy, and if you WERE fertile at the time of unprotected sex, it would still be too early for pregnancy symptoms like nausea.<br>  <br>  More likely you have the flu or a virus, but if your symptoms don't resolve or get worse, see your doctor or do a pregnancy test. (YOu'd need to wait about 2 1/2 weeks from unprotected sex for the test to be accurate.)|`|uuHPneEcaa	u can only take the plan b pill up to 72 hours after intercourse. Maybe u took it too late. U could be pregnant. cause the pill won't work if u are already pregnant. u could be feelin that way because of side effects. <br>  <br>  u might wanna go to the doctor to make sure ur alright.
kGkUG0fKaa	My doctor told me to get Vitamin E pills when I had this same problem and let me tell you they worked like a charm. My boobs felt like I had milk in them (and I have been pregnant before so I knew the feeling) and they felt heavy and hard, like they would fall off.......<br>  <br>  He told me that If I drink too much caffiene or smoke, or eat too much sweets it can cause my boobs to hurt and that doctors reccomend Vitamin E pills so i took them and I have been taking them since then because I love my coffee and candy and I don't wan tmy breasts to be all sore....<br>  <br>  <br>  Trust me, they'll work and you'll love em!<br>  Nothing wrong with gaining a few pounds...nobody likes a bone but a dog anyway!|`|rDPADat1aa	You should test anyway.  A friend of mine in middle school (like 15 years ago now), her mother found out she was pregnant even though her husband had a vasectomy years earlier.  She didn't cheat either.  It happens.  Take a test.  If it's negative, see your doctor about the weight gain and sore breasts.|`|onOZ76esaa	some vasecomys dont always work.<br>  go get a pg test today just to be safe.<br>  just go check. <br>  and if not, go try seeing a doctor because it may or may not be serious.|`|QGuxbItCaa	I would rather have small breasts than my wife to get fat. Wow 15lbs.|`|xFVDjZqPaa	buy a pregnancy test God has a way of working in peoples life that is much greater than man|`|oWAUb6vpaa	You didn't mention whether or not you're menstrual cycle has been normal and that would be an important piece of information in answering your question. <br>  <br>  I would still take a pregnancy test escpecially if you missed a period or had a very light period. Sometimes life is created even years after a vasectomy (and no one can explain why) but it has happened and DNA testing on baby and daddy is the proof, so there's no harm is taking a pregnancy test. <br>  Now, if you get a negative result, you need to go to your gyno asap - there could be many reasons why your breasts feel so tender and the results could be one that you don't want to hear but need to know about as early as possible incase you need any treatment - the sooner you know something the better. <br>  <br>  Good luck and take care..|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	Vasectomies can reverse themselves, just so you know.<br>  <br>  Other possible reasons for breast tenderness could be your hormone levels. Ovulation/menstruation/menopause could all contribute. Also, perhaps you just need a different bra. Wearing a bra that isn't supportive enough could cause soreness.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	If you're worried about it, take a test or see your doc. :)|`|aL87VTpAaa	maybe it is full with so much milk|`|wUodHpEuaa	yeah it's pms.. breasts get tender right before a womans period
Coc593Ikaa	So she hasn't missed a period yet? Then no, there would not be enough pregnancy products to qualify as "thick tissue" even if she were pregnant. She may jsut be having an odd period or odd spotting.

x8JRkRNkaa	I don't think you're paranoid at all. You've already gone through 2 premature deliveries. And you're showing signs of going early yet again. It must be scary! I know I would be going nuts. I think it would be a very good idea to let your doctor know right away that you're having symptoms of preterm labor starting up. I wish you all the best of luck. You've been through so much already!|`|7r4paUFhaa	Considering your history of preterm labor, you should probably go in and get checked out. Better to be safe.|`|wx32VQSWaa	If your braxton hicks has calm down I wouldn't worry. Carrying multiples is common not to go to full-term. If right now the contractions are still close together with or without pain, drink plenty of water and time your contractions for 1-2 hours. Go to the hospital if you are getting more than 6 bh within an hour to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  I've had 14 painless braxton hicks within an hour, I went in to the hospital and was 1cm dilated. They had to inject 2 steroids shots for babys lungs and put me on magnesium sufed to stop the contractions. I was only 30 weeks...luckily they were to stopped my contractions. Now I'm home from the hospital still waiting on the arrival of my 1st babygirl.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Your not being paranoid consirdering your history of preterm labor even someone that hadnt been through that would be feeling uneasy. I would go to the doctor and let them know whats going on so they can check you and if you are going into labor they can give you something to stop the contractions. good luck.
pzgPsne9aa	Yes, they should be sending information.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	If you requested information, I would assume so.<br>  EDIT:<br>  i'll give you a star for a best answer :]
AFxOZ0Hxaa	If your AF is due tomorrow, you could take a test!! Try it and let us know! Best of luck & baby dust.
PHOyKsmPaa	Perhaps it is diaper rash or an irritation on the skin from a scrape or fall.  I would just put antibiotic ointment on it. Any ointment that will repel the urine will help with avoiding stinging when he pees.  I am sure it will heal quickly.|`|pL98H8y6aa	is he  circumcised|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Use your diaper rash cream (as that is probably what it is).  You also need to be aware (I was surprised when this happened to my son) that boys can get yeast infections.  If this is the case then the diaper rash med will make it worse, and you will need to visit a pharmacy or your doctor for the proper med.  This heals up really fast; I let my son run around with no diaper on so he could get some air.  I was told this was common, although a yeast infection seems like a girl thing...|`|pT7jrsAgaa	When my son was around that age he developed an allergic reaction to his urine.  He was a good sleeper so he didn't wake up at night after a full diaper.  Around 7am he woke up screaming his little heart out.  When I changed him, his wee wee was hugely swolen and red.  Dr. treated and he was fine, I just had to set my alarm every two or three hours to make sure he didn't have his urine soaking on his skin for very long.  If it continues, you might need to talk to his dr.  Good luck!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Same as a diaper rash.<br>  There was trapped moisture. Just put triple paste, butt paste, whatever you use.<br>  And let him get air down there when you can.
cnIzqEoDaa	You can start after your period ends. You can even start during your period if you want. Don't jump up right after intercourse, lay in the bed and help gravity along for a little while. Good Luck!|`|DDswEgtZaa	well you need to determine your cycle length and go from there.  most people have a 14 day luteal phase (post ovulation).  So for example if you cycle is 28 days long than today is cycle day 1.  Your period would be on Mar 22nd.  So you would ovulate on Mar 9th.  Try using OPK kits, they work wonders on letting you know when you are about to ovulate.  Just start BDing On March 5th and do it every other day until March 12th.  But use your cycle length to get a better estimate too!  Good luck and baby dust!!!!|`|uNRvZWifaa	day 1 being the day you started your period start having sex on day 10 and do it every other day. you will ovulate between days 10-17 so the best time to do it would be day 10 12 14 16 if you want to heck throw in day 18.|`|ssDPdqZaaa	ttc?  start right away!  dont make the mistake of just trying on the day of ovulation.  sperm can live up to 7 days, (some DRs say 9) <br>  lots of women get preg when they had sex a week before they ovulated <br>  good luck!
AEyztU2laa	It depends on exactly what it is.  Unexplained build up of fluid in the uterus does increase the risk of miscarriage or can be a sign or a miscarriage in its early stages.  If it's a sac or pouch in the uterus with fluid it may be a molar pregnancy.  It can also be associated with an ectopic pregnancy but only a ruptured one to the best of my knowledge.  It can also be a build up of old blood which also increases miscarriage rate.  If it's in the wall of the uterus you may have a condition called adenomyosis which does not affect fertility however it can be very painful.<br>  <br>  I hope your pregnancy continues and that you get more help from the next doctor.|`|kyoVjNpSaa	When did you get a positive test? I would be due the same day according to calculators but haven't tested yet? Was the doctor able to tell you that you were pregnant by ultrasound? Sorry I know that you are asking the question, but was trying to get some support.<br>  <br>  I have no idea about the question you are asking, why did he say did he have a reason?|`|aeuWwrehaa	its true so brace yourself hun if it happens it will be the worst thing ever in your life i have been there and it sucks except i carried my baby up to the 12 week mark when in fact it had died at 7 weeks i had to have a d&c but to me its gods way of saying something is wrong|`|5axGfFofaa	he would know best...is he going to do something to help you prevent a m/c???  i would ask him to try.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Okay I know your scared but ill share something with you that may make u feel better. When I was 4 wks they thought I was having an ectopic b/c I had some fluid around the uterus and fallopian tubes. to make a VERY long story short  they did surgery and there was no ectopic pregnancy and they found I had endometriosis and some cysts (that everyone has when pregnant they secrete progesterone) and that was causing a lot of fluid. I am also concidered high risk and have to go to a perinatal center for some tests but my dr said that once the heart rate is established your risk goes down tremendously! So everything is not 100%. I know its a scarry time trust me I just went through it and everything is fine! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!! keep me posted!!!! Ur in my prayers!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: OHH i still have fluid behind the uterus and have a subchorinic blood clot but everything is fine! You just have to take it easy and I PRAYYYYYYYYY that everything works out for u girl!!!<3<3|`|mKcLCpZSaa	The doctor sounds like he knows what he is talking about.  I have never heard of that but at 4weeks there isn't much they can do.  I am so sorry.|`|DHt8w4oFaa	if the doctor said it, its probably true .. sorry|`|XyRzSzjtaa	im sorry to hear that, i hope you see another docter and he says ur ok. <br>  <br>  good luck
xGI9z01Maa	Try feeding him just before bed.  He/she might just need something more to hold him/her through the night.  But it might be that he is looking for the security of the bottle not just the food.  You might want to get him a teddy bear to take the bottles place.  But buy two and exchange them each week.  It's a pain when you can't find the favorite stuffed animal at night.  This work for me until my last child, her favorite was something that her grandmother gave her and I could not find a second.|`|wvzQObahaa	are you feeding  him the proper amount  through the day ??<br>  if yes , i suggest offering the last amount of milk just before he goes  to sleep . if he wakes up after doing that ,i guess he just needs his mom's warm hugs and attention ! <br>  as hard as it sound (and  will be),just leave him crying !!<br>  good luck !|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	u need to let him cry a little, he will be ok, my son cried and cried for his binky when we took it away, but in the long run it was the right thing, and giving kids milk at night can make there teeth rot. just be strong, he will be ok|`|deIzFnV8aa	No CRy Sleep ?Solution, by Elizabeth Pantley, has lots of ideas fot reducing night waking. worth a trip to the library|`|byM2zxPAaa	he might be thirsty, give him a bottle of warm water.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I haven't been through this yet, but maybe putting a bottle of water to bed with him?  I'm not sure that would be the right thing....but it is an idea.
JAdNkzENaa	it completely depends on how old and big she is.<br>  <br>  the rule of thumb is that if she is bigger than 8 pounds you let her sleep - she will wake up when she gets hungry enough<br>  <br>  if she is smaller than 8 pounds you need to wake her up to eat. im assuming if you have given her solids she is bigger than 8pounds. if she continues this behavior today i would see her doctor today or tomorrow.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	How old is she?  Is she running a fever?  5 ounces is too little in my opinion, even for a baby that is a bit off their feed.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	How old is your baby girl?<br>  <br>  If she's under a year, and old enough to be eating solids,  she needs way more milk (breast or formula).<br>  <br>  If she's losing weight, take her to her doctor, asap. If it's only been a day or too, give her another day or so, and offer a lot of fluids, she may just be feeling under the weather, or like you said, teething. Definitely keep an eye on her weight though. Weightloss is a definite sign that something is wrong. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.
XRbHcGuLaa	Everyone's hormones are at a somewhat different starting level so for the HCG to double enough times to reach 25 would vary from person to person.  As you probably know, the HCG doubles every day in early pregnancy so I would guess that 2-3 days after implantation would be a safe bet to take a hpt and get an accurate result.  First Response Early Results is know to pick up even less than 25 too so that's a good early test to use.  Good luck!  Don't forget too that some pregnant women do not get a positive until well after their period was late, even if they implanted on days 6 to 10.|`|5axGfFofaa	You are suppose to wait 4 days after implantation to test (approximately)
sgMno1PRaa	Dont get upset its still early, I didnt get a positive till i was 5 days late and I was using first response ones too. Just wait it out and if has happened you will know soon.<br>  Good Luck|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Why not wait till you are 14 dpo like your last pregnancy?  Well, since you are spotting around the same time frame as your previous pregnancy I bet you are pregnant!  *gives you a hankie*  Don't cry dear.  Everything will work out in the end.  You'll see!!!|`|ZQ8GvmZwaa	I really think there is still room for you this month. There is still a big posibility that the test can turn positive in a couple of days. I first got a faint positive from the cheap tests and then from the expensive first response. Dont cry!!!|`|fYMWDQLGaa	No pls dont cry for this and push urself stressed. being stress is not going to help if u r pregnant. <br>  <br>  book an appointment for blood test in ur local clinic. faint positive means u r pregnant , test again after 2 days in the early morning(first urine of the day) so hearty congratulations....<br>  <br>  take care...|`|JjBwydymaa	Dont cry hunni...<br>  <br>  You may have tested too early.... test on 14DPO and see what the result is.<br>  <br>  Please be patient.. TTC can take a long time! Good luck x|`|sstNdyYVaa	try again after a week and maybe ull get a positive test? or go and see the docs<br>  <br>  all the best xx|`|TGiAZXbfaa	everybodys bodies are different. when i found out ages ago i was pregnant i got a few negatives before i got a postive. i wouldnt stress yaself out because if you arent pregnant your period is unlikley to come and if you are pregnant then the baby wont want mummy being stressed.<br>  <br>  Just relax and see what happens. id wait til your atleast 5-7 days late before testing,.<br>  <br>  Good Luck sweetie xx
00X4m7vjaa	well hes not supposed to hit you  weather you are pregnant or not. but he has a right to be mad. you are 16 and pregnant its really not something to be proud about. but if he ever his you call the cops its illegal period, pregnant or not. and no weather you have a kid or not you are your mom dependent until your 18. but you could get an attorney and fight for emancipation|`|67QVKHQ3aa	tell ur mom and step dad to piss off and go somewhere ur wanted, and if that mofo hits you call the cops rite away b/c a cop would never tell anyone to hit anyone, especially if your pregnant..|`|a2aafb60224488f9314dfd227d2cdb18aa	Please abort or preferably put the baby up for adoption.  Don't bring an innocent baby into this mess.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	If I were you, I would leave. Who cares what your mom thinks, she obviously doesn't care about your well being. If she did, she wouldn't let your stepdad treat you that way. Leave now.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	You would have to contact your local magistrate if you want to move in with the boyfriend - ask for a "emancipation".<br>  <br>  Once you do that though, you will have to provide for yourself from then on - no more mom and dad responsible for you.  Usually these are given to 17 year olds, especially when they are close to 18 or enlisting in the military etc, but it's not unheard of for a 16 yr old to get one, being pregnant might actually help you in that case - can you prove the boyfriend can help take care of you?<br>  <br>  <br>  Also - if he threatens to hit you - call the police.  They are required to protect not only you but the unborn child as well.<br>  <br>  Some states have a protection against unborn children so that if he hurt you badly and the baby was lost, he would be charged with murder - but I don't know what state you are in.<br>  <br>  Get protection after you move too - like a restraining order. They are free but they only last for a while.  If you get one though - he doesn't have to know when they expire  ;-)<br>  <br>  Stay safe hon!!!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	you need to speak to a guidance counselor at your school, or to a police officer immediately. you are not a piece of s*** and you deserve to be in a situation where you and your unborn baby are safe! it is not just illegal to hit you, it is also illegal to threaten to cause you bodily harm. you need to speak to someone who will be able to help you and possibly get into a home where you will be safe!!!!!!! <br>  (p.s. i read in a previous answer that you should 'abort your baby' you and your child both have a right to a healthy and happy life! and stress can cause harm to your baby even before it's born, try your best not to expose yourself to negative comments about your pregnancy)
oXzHvsBpaa	Yes of course you could be pregnant again. One of my friends got pregnant again 3 months after giving birth to her son. If you had unprotected sex then of course. Why not take a test?|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	It is completely possible.  If you have had unprotected intercourse and are not on birth control there is a high chance of pregnancy.  If you're breastfeeding, you can still get pregnant as well.<br>  <br>  I would take a test and call your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12395149	yes.|`|uG7cEOqMaa	It's possible. <br>  <br>  You could go to a pharmacy and buy a test kit or go to a clinic for the same test and pay an additional consultation fee too.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	I got pregnant when my son was 7 months old. so yeah of course you could be! take a test.|`|n1sxDwvgaa	Sure! My daughter-in-law gave birth just 9 weeks ago and she is pregnant again because she was't on birth control yet. A family friend has a 4 month old and pregnant again at 40 yrs old for the same reason.|`|wCH0gHqfaa	That's a quick turnaround.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	yup.

I have not idea where their needs are going to come from.  But, check the local churches and see if they have a care center which are donations from the church members and community.  I have been doing that for my boys.  If you attend a church=let the church know what is going on and your needs-they can help meet those needs and should.

The will discreetly help.<br>  <br>  And to the 1st poster, If you donate for children, you are bringing light in their life, they should have a stress-free childhood and should not be punished for having a less privileged life. Parents do not intentionally inflict that kind of life on a child. <br>  Since you have a computer, do a search in your city for charities that will donate children's clothes.<br>  Also since you have a computer, if you want a litigimate job apply for a work at home job (WAH) with www.westathome.net. You pick your own hours and they have many many positions with different companies. It costs you nothing and you have the benefit of working at home and setting your own hours. I do it. I love it.<br>  <br>  <br>  CHIN UP!|`|KQU5y20waa	this is a Response to   "chikyo"  .. you are a rude and inconsiderate human being. you have no compassion and if you have any kids....i feel so very sorry for them, for having a mother like you with no heart. obviously you have everything given to you on a silver platter or use others, or don't work hard for the things that you get. cause in to days hard world, everyone struggles. you had absolutely no right to say the things that you said. she was asking for things for her kids....not herself. and to sell her computer? how do you know that was not a gift...or a computer that she got for free, or a hand me down , or even a 25$ computer that she got before she hit hard times. why don't you grow up. get a life, and grow a heart. if you are even capable of doing that. i will remember you,,,,, and all that you said. but until then ...gfys....ylb.|`|MtU2yH3gaa	Try Craigslist.com, its an amazing site.

Try it :)|`|AA12021892	Sorry hon but My kids are pretty much grown. I was in ur shoes years ago and i will tell u where u can go. First go to community action in ur area.

i3PGjRRfaa	Sounds like AIDS.............|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Could be anything - possibilities are appendicitis, indigestion and constipation.<br>  <br>  Or you could be pregnant. Makes no difference whether he pulls out or not. There's sperm in precum and it only takes one. Probably not, though - it would be unusual to have bad pain as a pregnancy symptom. Go see your doctor.<br>  <br>  It's spelt SEX, btw. If you are mature enough to have it, you are mature enough to write it down.|`|KozoNqpsaa	Might just be that you're stressing out over nothing. If you're not due for AF for another two weeks yet, odds are you wouldn't be feeling pregnancy pains this early. If you're that sick though, try calling your doctor. Maybe you have the flu or some other illness totally unrelated to your sex life. If you don't want to get pregnant, stop using the pull & pray method! It's not effective birth control.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	You're most fertile around the time of ovulation, which is usually about 14 days before your period starts.<br>  <br>  Good odds you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  In addition, for what it's worth, there are STD's that don't require full intercourse for transmission, so don't rule them out 100%.|`|H01LiOoxaa	could be bladder infection, with the hurt ur describing. but could also be pregnant witht he sickness. tiredness well could be alot of different things. dont think it is std, not too sure of the symptoms i have er see to admit but rather see a pro.|`|GFJmg9BQaa	uhm your probably pregnant.<br>  <br>  pulling out dosnt work.<br>  <br>  theres still precum etc.<br>   <br>  r u on birth control?|`|KSF5Ilckaa	<a href="http://givinginfo.reads.it" rel="nofollow">http://givinginfo.reads.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|254f73136d365c40df7d456dee73062faa	GO TO THE DOCTORS, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN TELL YOU 100% WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU.|`|27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	You're probably pregnant.

0qP8gLpyaa	Talk to your doctor about the speech. Most kids can say words and short sentences at nearly 2. There is probably a delay somewhere that needs help.<br>  As for the food-  put the little one in  a highchair to eat and the older into a booster seat that has a tray he can't remove himself and then give bottles food. Keep them across the room from one another so he can't take the food from the younger one.  Also, give only food at meals and snacks, no milk. Until he eats real food no milk until after. I know someone in my family that had this kind of similar problem around your sons age and he was blocked up from stem to stern as it were from drinking nothing but milk and very little food.  It took a team of specialists and expensive medicine procedures to get it fixed. You need to mention the eating situation to the doctor and in the mean time make the rule "when you eat your meal you can have your drink"because otherwise there is no incentive to get what he wants.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	He needs to eat more solid foods.  Try a kids supplemental drink (kind of like the Ensure drinks).  They meet a lot of the nutritional needs for kids, taste good, and are the milk like substances, basically comfort food, for a toddler.<br>  <br>  By playing with him some in his high chair, he might take on to eating more.  Something like counting cheese cubes and eating them together, so he's still getting the bonding time is great.|`|FQrl1Azbaa	try giving him milk based foods like chees and yoghurt to start with. <br>  <br>  make him a bottle of milk as a reward for eating. <br>  <br>  put him in the highchair while baby drinks.
cnIzqEoDaa	It is possible, sperm can survive for up to 72 hours (I have heard that they may survive longer though). It is always better if you can try several times, but there's still a possibility that you caught the egg. Good luck when it's time to test!!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	You could still have gotten pregnant from the intercourse on saturday because sperm can live in your vagina 5-7 days so its definately possible. It would of been good to BD on the day of your positive OPK too but hey if you couldnt dont sweat it. Good luck hope you get your positive soon.|`|Dz1AvLjwaa	50% chances<br>  last month i had unprotected sex with my husband 5 days before my ovulation(that was the only time we did it) and it dint work........<br>  i have read sperms live for 5 to 7 days but i think the duration is hardly 24 hrs......|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	You could very well get pregnant from that - I would check to see how you feel in a couple weeks - and then you can test about 3 to 4 weeks after you think you conceived.   <br>  <br>  Are you trying to get pregnant?   If so - GOOD LUCK!!! ;-)
txSiQc7Waa	Well, she could be. Since she's now late for her period, I would go buy a home pregnancy test (preferably first response early detection) and test. Good luck! I hope it turns out how you both want :)
c73QkZ2haa	If he has always had warm milk well hes probably just used to it and it is more comforting when hes going down to bed than a bottle of cold milk.|`|NroZQN5vaa	If he always had warm bottles when he was younger, then it's probably just a security blanket to him to have warm milk. But it could be that he likes the feel of it in his belly.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I had this same issue when my son was 11 months. He only wanted warm milk, I started heating it up less and less. WIth each bottle it wasn't as warm, it took a while. BUt you have to do it, I know by now they aren't even supposed to be on the bottle , I am having that problem with my daughter now 18months and still wants a bottle at bed time. Its hard to not give her one. <br>  Try heating it up less and less. He is used to it , its like his  bedtime routine , he knows when he goes to bed he will get a warm bottle and he doesn't want it any other way. YOu can do it MOM , just have patience|`|SO6tHlKcaa	he is used to it. thats what I would say. the same way he can be weaned off the comfort of a paci, bottle etc he can be weaned off warm milk...
FLnEqAivaa	Yes, I am 42 weeks today, and I have had the same thing. Midwife told me to take Vit C and it does help get rid of excess swelling, plus get plenty of fluids. Also helps to put your feet up, if swelling in your legs or feet.|`|gcy7KOkXaa	i had it when i was pregnant.40 wk 6 days.i went to the midwife. she checked me over just to be safe but everthing was fine.it went away when i had the baby in time.id go and get it checked to be safe.good luck.|`|TDVIb4SBaa	I would get in touch with either your midwife of doctor at once,you cannot be to careful.Yes I read it as 40 weeks 5 days ,phone surgery at once
AA10478980	There is no way to tell for sure within a few days.  You have to wait until you have missed a period.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You don't. The only way you can know other than by testing is if you normally have regular periods and you miss one.<br>  <br>  You don't want to buy a pregnancy test? They cost what, a dollar? Then stop fooling about - you couldn't POSSIBLY afford to bring up a child.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	you could always go to a psychic.  other than a test, thats the only way to know.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can't tell after just a few days. You have to wait until you miss your period and then if you do then you have to take a pregnancy test to be sure b/c stress can also make you miss a period.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well then the only other thing you can do is wait for a missed period. other then that there is no real way to tell|`|KozoNqpsaa	There is NO way to tell besides waiting for your period and testing if it doesn't come.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	There is no definite way to tell without either of those things.<br>  Its probably not likely, but always possible.<br>  You wouldn`t know for a weeks after the incident anyways. It takes 2-3 weeks to even miss a period if you fooled around during ovulation. But I think you`ll be fine.|`|H01LiOoxaa	you wont know unless you get a test and dont count on ur next period, you could still get ur period in ur first month of pregnancy. if it happened very recently get an over the counter pill think it is called the 48 hour pill gets rid off things if taken within 48 hours.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	im sorry but there is no way to know unless you take a test hun. I know your scared but wait until your expeted period and buy a pregnancy test. You will need to kno either way! If its within 72 hours go and get Plan B to prevent conception.GOOD LUCK!|`|lBT7Tel2aa	Wait for your period the next month. If it doesn't come, you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  There is no other way to tell without being tested.|`|bcb736d1104a75a2ea18d9ab51eac374aa	Wait for a missed period|`|wEwNDYPkaa	Well, if you don't have your period, but other words there is no way of finding out unless you take a test x GOOD LUCK! x
m9eSPvdfaa	Wow! What a little eater! My son is 2 1/2 months old and was eating 6 oz every 3 hours. I started him on cereal for his bedtime bottle to help him sleep longer (against his docs advice but it's my kid and not his. Besides, I came home from the hospital eating cereal and I'm fine)  He will now sleep 5-6 hours at night. However, 10-12 oz every hour is ALOT of food for such a little tummy. I don't think cereal is a bad idea and won't hurt her ( make sure it's rice ) but I don't think she is getting what she needs from the formula she is on. Keep track of how many wet and dirty diapers she has in a 24hr period. Frequency of wets and frequency and consistency of dirties would be useful info|`|FLEXqVoiaa	That seems like an awful lot of formula. When my daughter was 6 weeks, she drank about 4 oz. of breast milk from a bottle every 3 hours or so. And formula is supposedly more filling than breast milk. <br>  <br>  Cereal will most likely upset your daughter's stomach, and puts her at an increased risk of developing a food allergy. Also rice cereal has no real nutritional value. So by giving your daughter cereal, you are filling her tummy up with empty calories. She will then not be as hungry and won't consume as much formula (her only source of nutrition), which could lead to weight loss, failure to thrive, and malnutrition.|`|mSo2uSP9aa	you should talk to your doctor about this because 10 - 12 ounces every hour or so is to much. I wouldn't recommend starting the cerealthe recomend waiting until 6 months ( however usually 4 months is fine ) as long as they don't push it out with their tongue if they do they are not ready. but in your daughters case shes to young for it and her stomach won't be able to break it down|`|l0YvaYTDaa	It seems like alot.  I'm pretty sure babies are supposed to have between 28 and 32 ounces in a day.  Depending on how many times a day she gets fed, depends on how much she should be getting at a feeding.  They say that since milk/formula comes out of bottles so quickly, some babies will drink it whether they want it or not.  Does she seem hungry after an hour/hour and a half, or are you feeding her on your schedule?  If she's crying/fussy, do you try anything before feeding her?|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Shes a hungry one! My son was like that. I bought those cheap bottles at walmart because they have a bigger nipple hole and I would mix about a tablespoon of baby cereal in With the formula. It helps a lot , she will start eating every 2 or 3 hours rather than 1 or 1 and a half. Its an old trick. Some people say babiesaren'tt ready for cereal yet but when you have a hungry baby every hour and formula prices are crazy you will try it. <br>  It worked for me with both children , try it out I almostguaranteee it will work!|`|byM2zxPAaa	its very common for babies to do that believe it or not... my daughter drank 13 bottles per day within the space of 9 hours... <br>  defiantly add cereal to her bottles, just so that its heavier in her stomach to make her feel fuller and content with her feed<br>  Add 1 tablespoon at first to see if she will feed less on formula, but if feeds do not become further apart add one more tablespoon. you may need the next size up with your teat, so that the thicker fluid can flow through.|`|fQLeIAh1aa	just keep feeding her and call your ped. your baby is too young for cereal at this point. she may be going through a growth spurt also. does she spit up alot, is she cranky? my daughter has GERD and she seems hungry at times, then pukes. the link provided is on feedings, growth spurts and more.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Are you sure she's eating 10 ounces every hour an a half around the clock?  Because that is more than 200 ounces of formula per 24 hour period.  I just don't even see how that's physically possible for a newborn.  Or is it just during the day?<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, feed the baby when she's hungry, until she is full.  Don't bulk her up with other substances, just give her formula or breast milk until she is satisfied.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Well, you should not give her cereal, so forget about that one.<br>  <br>  But ... are you honestly saying that your baby is eating around 150  ounces of formula per day?  (10 ounces+ about 15+ times a day????)  How are you feeding it to her? (Even the largest bottles only hold 8 ounces.) <br>  <br>  How much is your baby eating in 24 hours?  If it's under around 50 ounces a day, that's fine.  If it's more than that, you need to check with your doctor to determine why your baby is needing so much food.  Could you be interpreting colic or gas for hunger? <br>  <br>  (BTW, if you're only nursing at night, your milk is going to dry up ... if it hasn't already.  You can't go 12-18 hours without nursing and expect to maintain a supply at this early age.)|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	2 months is early, but it seems as though my children keep starting things earlier than the child before.  Be sure to wean her on the cereal so it wont hurt the tummy.  Nursing is wonderful and I've nursed all of mine. They like to hold on to nursing as long as they can.  Sometimes they even pacify when you think they are eating.  They are getting smarter and smarter younger and younger these days.|`|C4miEeuYaa	Wow~ you have a hungry little girl! She may be hitting a growth spurt. But if this has been ongoing, I would talk to her pediatrician about starting rice in the bottles. Thickening it up will help her get fuller quicker. My daughter always eats a lot more when she hits a growth spurt. But she has never eaten over 8 oz of a bottle. She is 7 months and still has a 6oz bottle every 2-3 hours (aside from her baby food for breakfast and dinner). Good luck!|`|KvUJZa1Paa	Wow that is alot of food for a 2 month old. When my babies were that age they were getting 4 oz every 3-4 hours and sometimes left some in bottle. I didn't start cereal till about 5 months and jar food about 6 months.<br>  I think you should ask Dr maybe formula isn't satisfying her|`|NroZQN5vaa	Two months is pretty young to be starting on cereal. I think that you should talk to your doctor and see what they say about it.
AqThQCzzaa	I had an appt at 30 weeks (last week) and the dr told me to make sure my son is moving.  I asked if I should be doing 'kick counts' and she said at this point no because he's too big and moves more than he kicks.  He should be active around the same time every day and as long as he continues to be active he's fine.  The reason your baby is active at night is that while you move around during the day, the movement kind of lulls him to sleep.  When you stop moving, it's his cue to wake up.  My son is most active when I finally lay down at night.  If I happen to get the chance to rest in the afternoon he becomes active then too.  I usually wake up between 4-5am to use the bathroom and when I get back into bed he begins moving again.  <br>  <br>  I believe what you're feeling is normal...your activity keeps him sleepy, your inactivity wakes him up...perfectly normal!  As long as he's active when you're not that's good.<br>  <br>  You should probably begin seeing your midwife more than once a month at this point, which means you get the chance to hear your baby's heartbeat more often and be reassured that everything is well.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!!|`|sbfm5rCAaa	All babies have different activity patterns just like kids. Some are less active than others and some are more active at certain times of the day.<br>  <br>  My baby hardly moves during the day but as soon as I settle down in front of the TV or lie down in bed then my baby decides that it is time to start jumping around and playing trampoline with my bladder :)<br>  <br>  You have already found the pattern in your baby (which is like mine) and you will also probably find that this pattern is likely to continue when your baby is born.<br>  <br>  Looks like we will both be kept up late at night :)|`|KPuDlWFiaa	im coming up 30 weeks and i feel my lil boy move all day and night, sometimes on a weekend he's less active because i am i suppose but other than that just give him a lil poke he'll soon respond i know my baby does!! x|`|AA12345219	Often you'll feel your baby move more at night because babies are night owls! When we're up and around all day, we are essentially rocking them to sleep, but at night when we're still they're up! If you lay down during the day, you should be able to count three fetal movements in one hour (though it might only take five minutes to get there!). I generally would focus and pay attention during a few different hours of the day, and as long as I felt some movement then I wouldn't worry about it. A lot of times they may still be moving and you're just not paying attention because you're focusing on your own movement.|`|wnYn7tegaa	im 27weeks pregnant and my baby is the same little movement through the day and active at night, ive read books that say this is perfectly normal as baby's are relaxed by its mothers movements but when she lays still (like when u trying to sleep) they get bored and start moving about.. also he/she getting very cramped at this stage of pregnancy so u may well fell them moving around as u did in a earlier stage<br>  <br>  but if u are worried speak to your midwife they will not mind putting your mind at ease.|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	As long as your feeling him and hes moving, hes fine. I'm 28 weeks and I hate worrying. My doctor said I should feel him at least 10 times every 1-2 hours, but I'm never sitting still long enough.|`|wEwNDYPkaa	As long as you are doing everything right your baby will be healthy and your baby will move a lot x|`|tXfMArb6aa	I'm not a doctor but I am pregnant with my second child I know this can be scary at times I was just in the er anyhow if you feel uneasy or like something isn't right get it checked out have them put you on an nst to see how many accelerations your getting but from my experiences at 29 wks  my baby was pretty active and he may just be sleeping for long periods of time pay attention to when he moves the most it will probably be the same when he gets here and drink something really sweet that will usually get them going---good luck|`|AA11164125	if baby is active at night then chances are he is sleeping during the day any concerns and call ur midwife they are used to concerned mums calling randomly my baby is only active from 2pm onwards so i had the same concerns sure baby is fine xx
tCmwFJn5aa	No. I would not send you to school. <br>  <br>  I would let you sleep in and then take you out for breakfast.  Then, we would go shopping.  Afterwards, I would catch you up at home on the lessons that you missed at school, so you would not be behind in your studies.|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	If I was your Mother I would certainly not let the baby sleep with you. It should have it's own bed where it can sleep peacefully. If I was in your position, I would look after the baby - as you Mother seems incapable - for the night and try to go to school. However, if you were too tired, simply tell your Mother you had to stay up all night and are too exhausted to go to school.|`|vwOwnjUiaa	If i were your mom i would not have had my boyfriend there, especially if i had children and they had to go to school the next day...but if i were the mom you are describing, you would go to school so the 'slumber party' can continue.|`|JWm2Jzk9aa	Well seeing that your mom doesn't give a f*ck about how you sleep i wouldn't see why she would care if you went to school. Tell her since she had a slumber part with her boyfriend, you get to have one by yourself during school.|`|FERfSYtzaa	yes i would because i've been through that and still am, it teaches you about growing up and not to have a baby when you're young. so don't take it as something bad but a lesson about life, you will appreciate this one day. so go to school, no excuses|`|BUOJJpaCaa	I wouldn't send you to school if I were your mom.<br>  But if I was your mom, I would be ashamed of myself.|`|lxB9UgCiaa	nooooooo and wtf is ur moms problem|`|9e446fd9db4d9ad99d9a59fab5cbb25aaa	no because it would be my fault for you having to sleep with the baby|`|sUz0vIoKaa	ouch lol no that's bad then u will get in trouble for not concentrating in school|`|nKSmgjylaa	I'd flat out refuse to go if I were you. (:<br>  Just explain what happened + your mom will understand.<br>  Poor you!|`|Y2k81CWWaa	I wouldn't send you to school, because your MOM is the one who made you take care of the baby!|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes.  I would send you to school.<br>  <br>  Your mother should take care of the baby herself.  That should not be your problem.|`|pzgPsne9aa	My mother would definitely.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	absolutely not! that's so messed up!|`|MigBOiUPaa	no cuz u would just sleep in school anyway...lol|`|AA11593134	if i was your parent, and knew your sister, then I wouldn't have her with you in bed -- I would have had an air mattress (which I do -- and I think it is only like $20...) or a crib (if she's still a baby, she still falls off the bed, so I assume she is...). So you wouldn't have been in this predicament. <br>  And I wouldn't have had my slumber party over your sleep and school. I would have had that on Friday or Saturday. Or during the day while you're at school.<br>  But yes, I'd send you to school since school is important...|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	If I were your mom I would.<br>  You mom is making you take care of the kid so she can have happy hour? <br>  That's selfish. <br>  <br>  <br>  I personally would have the baby have it's own room,<br>  not have sex when my kids are home. <br>  <br>  And there wouldb't be a reason for you to stay home. <br>  <br>  <br>  but I shouldn't really be talking... <br>  I'm faking lady issues today so I can skip school.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	Yes. You're being a drama queen, and you need an education whether you are tired or not. Besides, you need the practice for those college days when you are up all night cramming for finals and still have to drag your behind in to class for the finals.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	No, I wouldn't send you to school.  I have a sister that hits and kicks in her sleep too.

fAGTOJRZaa	I started to show at 10 weeks and this is my first baby. I'm only 5'4" though and my friend who is 5'10" is not showing as much as me. I'm way past the baby bump at 17 weeks now and I've moved on to pregnant belly without question. So you should start to show soon.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I started to show in my mind @ 20 weeks, but honestly, no one could definitively tell until I was about 30-32 weeks. I was small to begin with, and it was my first baby, so those tight muscles had to be really banged out for my belly to show.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	with my first i did not show till i was 6 months so dont worry about it.|`|eMQrNqgAaa	Actually its different for every pregnancy. Some people at 16 weeks some at 25. It all depends on your body if your super skinny then super early but if your normal usually later. You may know the difference but other people just may think your fat. the joy of pregnancy ! good luck;]|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Everyone is different. I started showing around 14 weeks but not a lot. I think it started to become obvious for other people to tell I was pregnant around 22 weeks or so. It depends on your body though. Good luck and congrats!|`|ZzxxcFfsaa	well with first baby i did not start to show until i was about 5 or six months|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	With my first, I didn't have a noticeable baby belly until 7 months along. With my second, I got the belly around 4 months. <br>  <br>  However, it really does differ from person to person. Beginning weight, the kinds of food you are eating and the size of the baby will affect belly size.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|HYveAhbUaa	I'm 6 months and I just look like I ate a huge meal...some people look like they are about to pop at 6 months, so there is no real answer to this question.  Some people barely look pregnant at 9!|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	I would say around 5 months. When I was preggo at 16 years old, I hid my pregnancy until 5 months. LOL My dad figured it out when he noticed the belly.
AA11637393	raging hormones|`|wl7tlYOYaa	its because our hormones are all over the place...in my case everything either makes me cry or angry I feel very sorry for my hubby because he is suffering but I cant control myself.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hormones! they are all over the place when a woman falls preg and throughout it! lol|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Their bodies are undergoing huge changes to accommodate carrying a baby.  These changes are not just hormones, but, for instance, their pelvis is widening from the get-go to accommodate the baby as it develops.  Also, the fetus has a parasitic effect on the body, where it takes as much of the nutrients in the body as it needs, and the mother gets the rest, so if she isn't getting quite enough nutrition for her and the baby then she is suffering from malnutrition.  Add to this the stress of the fact that her body is no longer just her own, and the shocking concept that she is about to become someone's mother, and that the entire survival of another being is going to be her responsibility.  Add still to that the fact that there is ridiculous social pressure from family, her partner, her friends and society, and much of this pressure conflicts with other pressure.  Add to this that most of that social pressure is very vocal and total strangers come up to pregnant women and comment on things that under no other circumstance would be socially acceptable.  That is pretty much it in a nutshell.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Their is like, double the amount of hormones running around in an overweight body. You feel insecure and overwhelmed by the thought of having a living body in your own body.<br>  <br>  I'm pregnant and it took me 6 months to realize that I don't have control over the emotions.<br>  <br>  Crazy feeling..|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's hormones. But not every pregnant women is like that. My husband actually said that I seem to be a lot more calm and not as argumentative since I got pregnant.|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	It has a lot to do with the estrogen or testosterone in their systems. Women who are pregnant with girl babies have very high estrogen levels. Estrogen tends to make women a bit basket-casey with high mood swings and sometimes weepiness. If she is pregnant with a son, there will be extra testosterone in her system which usually makes the mommy a bit feisty sexually but she will still have increased levels of estrogen. As a general rule, be a pacifist while she is pregnant and just be there to rejoice with her and hold her when she is crying...even if she was happy a second ago. :-)|`|xRyGMuXeaa	during pregnancy, the woman becomes emotional due to her hormonal changes. However, it also depends n the women. One women might have a skyrocket high in hormones, while another could be subtle. And imagine carrying that baby for 9 months!|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	Overabundance of hormones and a new pregnancy one. The massive and extremely sore breasts also make us very snappy.|`|naWeDOAyaa	Hormones!!!

oXzHvsBpaa	My son was 3 months old before he started sleeping though the night. The world is still new to your son. He still hasn't adjusted to it and most babies don't until they are about 3 months and sometimes older. Sleep when your son sleeps. Even if it is during the day.Thats what I did and it helped a lot.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is 7 months, she still wakes up every few hours. It's exhausting, but it's motherhood.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	He is only 3 weeks old so anything more cant be expected of him sad to say.  3 hours is a great stretch, some moms would die for that.  As he grows and his belly can hold more than he should start to sleep longer.  Unfortunately there is no set time in which a newborn sleeps longer than 2-4 hours at a time, you just have to wait it out.  Nap when he naps, that always helped me.  Heck I still sometimes nap when my 19 month old, that sleeps 12 hours a night, naps.|`|avMjefgtaa	Well me and my husband didn't start sleeping for at least 4 hours straight  until she was 3 months old she would wake up though like 2 times this went on until she was 13 months. until then she slept the whole night without waking up, but all babies are different your baby is still to young he is only 3 weeks, the first 2months are the worst, i say they started eating more when they are about 4 months!! Good Luck|`|c73QkZ2haa	My daughter is almost 4 months old she still doesnt sleep through and sometimes she decides its wake time so stays up for like an hour no matter what i do... <br>  <br>  Every baby is different. You need to get sleep when he is sleeping no matter what time of day. Your cleaning and everything can wait. Babies do not have a schedule and need to be fed when hungry. Just be patient and take help where you get it and sleep whenever you can. Sleep is more important right now than a clean floor.. :D|`|DIZKlxNraa	Oh... welcome to motherhood!! My son is almost 9 months and wakes up every 2-3 hours all night long. I didn't know how I am going to live without my 8 hours of sleep that I used to get before the birth of the baby but I kind of got used to no sleep. I hope it gets better for you soon. Every baby is different.|`|nZj78jvYaa	Each kid is different but i have to say if he is eating 4 oz at 3 weeks you are already doing better than some.you could use baby center as a guide but that is all there is are guides . A better sugegstion for you is to try to sleep when he does i know this is hard and that you feel like there is so much more that could be done when he does nap but the best thing to do for you and the baby is to make sure you are rested.<br>  i have a 5 month old and at the beginning he only slept for 2 hours between feedings and then as he got bigger and the amount increased the sleeping increased so that by 2 months he went for 4-5 hours at night and then little naps during the day. just hang in there it get better|`|byM2zxPAaa	your baby is drinking the perfect amount for his age. He may start to drink a higher volume of milk after 6 weeks of age. <br>  when he wakes up during the night try him with 4 ounces of warm water, most of the time babies are just thirsty. <br>  Also make sure the room is not to cold or to warm and that there is enough air circulation. He could possibly be uncomfortable.|`|XfGOFc5saa	unfortunately this is pretty impossible to predict as all babys are different. My baby is 8 weeks old and we are putting her to bed at 7pm with a bottle and she is then waking at about 1am, 4am and then wakes between 6 - 7am. My health visitor has suggested giving her formula for hungry babies as the last feed before bedtime to try to get her to sleep longer. Good luck i know how hard it can be|`|BEYJrXLnaa	he should start sleeping longer anytime now but if he is fussy alot it may be gas if possible try bottles with dropin inserts so you can squeeze air out reducing gas making them more comfortable and able to sleep longer|`|AA11637393	i know - i have a 6 week old-this is my 3rd baby.   around 6 weeks old my babies starting sleeping from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. and then from 2-4
tLGbtmGsaa	babies can get teeth anytime from the time they are born up to 12 months.  Although it is very rare some babies are born with teeth.  As for crawling some babies don't crawl at all.  The can go from sitting to walking and bypass crawling.  One of my twins did not start to crawl until her first birthday.  I was very worried but she is all good now.  If your baby does not get teeth by 12 months go get her checked out.    Just remember every baby is different.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	You can't compare your daughter to other babies. All babies develop differently. My daughter didn't get her first tooth until around 10 months, and she didn't start crawling until 10 months. She started walking at 13 months (which is the average age to start walking).|`|vue9NOhYaa	Neither of these is of concern.  <br>  <br>  Teething in particular is nothign to worry about. The 'average' age for getting a first tooth is about 7 months, and many babies don't get any teeth for a year or more. <br>  <br>  Crawling isn't really a milestone.  Some babies never crawl at all, some crawl late, or only briefly.  If she's meeting her other milestones, I wouldn't worry about this a bit.  When she decides she wants to go somewhere, she'll figure out a way to get there.<br>  <br>  (BTW, walking at 9 months would be VERY early, so don't use her cousin as an example.)|`|C4miEeuYaa	No worries! Every baby is different. Mine is 7 and a half months-and still no teeth. And she just started trying to crawl last week. She won't have it down for about another week, she'll be 8 months by then. I knew a little boy who didn't cut his first tooth till he was 13 months. True story! And then the baby boy I nanny got his two bottom teeth at 5 months and started crawling at 6 months. You're baby is just fine. It just takes a little longer for some.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	You shouldn't be worried, there's no point in comparing your baby to someone elses.<br>  <br>  My son crawled at 10 months, got his first 4 teeth all at once at 6 months. He had a mouth full of teeth by 12 months.<br>  <br>  My daughter crawled at 5 months, and got her first 2 teeth at 7 months. She's now 10 months and still has just 2 teeth.<br>  <br>  See? Every baby is different.|`|DIZKlxNraa	You shouldn't be concerned. Every baby is different. <br>  Some babies never crawl and go straight to walking. Some start crawling as late as 9-10 months. <br>  Some babies get their first teeth at 3 months, some as late as 18 months. <br>  Relax and enjoy your baby.|`|TAGsuqu2aa	Every baby is different, and every milestone is achieved when the child is ready. <br>  <br>  That is great your baby says mama and baba. My 11 month old only says dada, no mama yet. :(   She did crawled by 6 months, starting to walk by 8 1/2 which is a bit sooner than her older brother who started to walk at 9 months. My kids are just very determined and independent, very demanding as well.|`|y9dpSGM1aa	well, Im just basing this off my little baby cousin... she just turned 1 year old like 2days ago.. shes been walking since about 9months and she has been crawling since about 7months... so i hope that helps.
AA11637393	You should be fine.  I worked in a building where they painted with oil based.  The doctor told me as long as it was well ventilated its ok.
sbeoF50gaa	All the time. You can get pregnant while on your period, and everyday in between. Ovulation comes when it comes and unless you know your ovulation days you won't know what days to be extra careful. You can get pregnant even if he "pulls out" so if you are trying to avoid pregnancy, get on some B.C.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When, according to careful use of Natural Family Planning and monitoring of YOUR body's signs and signals, you determine that YOU have already ovulated this cycle, or are well in advance of when you  are likely to ovulate.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Time to have sex?

MHOxPs8Oaa	I just would make the bottle with warm water. Its easier to make it right then for me.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Never leave formula out at room temp.  Like regular milk, it will spoil quickly.<br>  <br>  (I do have to ask -- is there any particular reason you are supplementing with formula?  Breastfeeding IS best for baby, and even small amounts of formula may interfere with some of the benefits. Also, giving bottles keeps the milk supply from increasing as it needs to AND puts baby at risk for nipple confusion. )|`|J6IOqzL0aa	i warm my formula in a water bath before use as you never can quite tell when a little one will want to eat and formula is only good at room temperature for an hour. Personally i boil water and put it in bottles in the fridge then when it is time to eat i put the bottles in a boiling water bath for about 2 minutes. Test the water temp, add the formula and ready to feed. that way if a bottle doesnt get used it is only water going to waste not formula as it is expensive. But you can heat the formula already mixed in a water bath as well.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i don't like leaving bottles out at room temp for long periods of time mainly because after you take a bottle out of the fridge you should use it within a small amount of time and leaving it to warm up to room temperature can take a while. i would boil some water and put it in that or run it under hot water in the sink for a little bit. that will warm it up faster so that baby doesn't have to wait as long.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Don't make up in advance,just big business getting you to spend more money..Boil water & store that in fridge,take out as needed,warm & then add formula,that way your only making what you need..Simple..|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Just mix the formula with room temperature water as needed.  It's much quicker then waiting for a bottle to warm up.|`|c73QkZ2haa	No use either a cup of hot water or a bottle warmer. Its not supposed to sit out for more than an hour and it would take awhile for it to warm at room temp.<br>  <br>  ETA: Most companies will recommend mixing what you need for the whole day as it helps prevent mismeasurements that happen often when people mix per bottle that can result in health problems for the baby especially when using powdered formula. It has nothing to do with them wanting to make more money. We all know how much formula we use in a day and if you make that much it wont go to waste...I'd rather have the assurance that its mixed properly so we have a jug that we use and mix each morning.|`|l7RJkc3baa	I alwasy gave my baby fresh formula... I mixed it always when baby asked for it. I never stored in the fridge or room temp. I always got up, used my bottle warmer, then added formula, shook it , and gave it to my little one. Simple!<br>  <br>  I see no reason why should you rist it by storing it in the freinds, when at the end it's bad after 1 day and you still need to take ur time to warm it up.<br>  <br>  I believe it's lazy,... when you store formula.|`|9EgWyiNbaa	We used to nuke it in microwave for couple secs at a time then check and do it again if still too chilled but just be careful to give it a good shake afterwards and ALWAYS check temperature by squirting some on back of your hand before feeding baby.. though it wasnt long before he would drink it straight from fridge..hes always been bit weird bout things n at 3yrs he still surprises us on a daily basis.. good luck in the future|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I would use a warm water bath because you can't leave a bottle out for more than 1 hour without having to toss it.
sgPG1CL0aa	when i was growing up and still am i found it sweet to see mature parents pushing the buggy and holding their babies <br>  now i see teenagers my age (19) and younger doing this and im like why dont you want to first grow up yourself?<br>  i could never imagine being a teenage mum and would never want my child to be one but at the same time having children is a blessing and if kids feel this is what they need to fulfil their lifes then who am i to say different. live and let live.|`|7fGgQ88Qaa	I think that the parents of the children that had the kid (The babies grandparents) Should have custody. <br>  <br>  There is no way a 14 year old can take care of a kid. <br>  <br>  With school and everything. <br>  <br>  Kids having kids is just wrong. <br>  <br>  If you aren't able to take care of a kid,<br>  adoption, abortion, or just start of from the top with the pill, condoms, or freakin' keep the legs closed!|`|tsRhqi0Daa	i say noooooo|`|J6IOqzL0aa	i agree that this is an awful situation with the rate of teenage pregnancies especially in the uk. However even if it is prohibited by law how can you inforce it? In the UK the legal age for sex is 16. Everyone one know sex leads to babies so they would have to increase the law on that as well. I think they need to have sex ed at younger ages in school and have more available options to birth control because i think regardless of laws or sex ed classes lots of people will still have sex under 18 so we need to increase birth control awareness.|`|clc6qQDAaa	Your just going on what you hear i no people at my age (17) that have babies or are pregnant. They arent "getting" babies they are having them. And as for the 13 year old they dont even no if Alfie is the father. How can it be law what will they do with the babies? put them up for adoption like the other children take them away from their mother and screw them up mentally and physically. You will never stop underaged children having sex how would they even no about sex? Surely sex educationg could cause more problems? they hear about sex fro some where they wont automatically no about it. Teenagers are capable of taking care of babys they may be young but this does not mean they can not take ont he responsiblity.|`|RCRTyVKKaa	Well 13 is a bit young.<br>  <br>  I WAS 15 WHEN FELL PREGNANT AND 16 WHEN I HAD MY SON.<br>  <br>  I live in a unit, i pay rent, i pay for my son's child care bills, i pay for my schooling bills.

Not like these kids, who have probably dropped out and get 20 hours a week at McDonalds and spend the rest of their time hanging out at the mall with friends.|`|AA11390428	I think it is ok.   Of course such case are rare.   Human being is also a kind of natural animal, so it is natural.   But the society should be responsible as human being are living in society.  So the social organization, namely the school, the education board should find some ways to deal such case.|`|0HICV1Tmaa	Honestly,why is it any of your business.I had my twins when I was 17,their dad and I paid for everything for them(even though my daughter died at 2 days)without any help from the government or our parents.Is that irresponsible?I could understand if you were a teen parent,or if your parent was,but I doubt it,so why is it any of your concern.Guess what?I'm 23 now,my son is 6,and I have two other daughters ages 2 and 8 months.I consider myself a pretty good mother.I have never been on welfare,and my parents don't help me,and never did.All of my children are 3 happy kids.And i finished high school,and am going back to college next year.|`|Xu5BtID1aa	I totally understand what you mean! Kids these days think that having a baby is the best thing ever, but doesn't stop and think about what responsibilities come along with that!

THIS IS WHY OUR ECONMY IS BAD!!!!!!! It is ridiculous! If they go to school all day, how on earth do they expect to pay for babysitting? <br>  <br>  Children shouldn't even be thinking about sex!!!! They need to worry more about their grades! If children worried more about school as they do sex, we would have EXTREMELY SMART children!!! Would you not agree???<br>  <br>  Children drinking, and doing drugs.. Drugs can kill you and your child kids, so if you were happy your pregnant, well be prepared to POSSIBLY miscarry, and if you drink be prepared to POSSIBLY miscarry, and you are TOO YOUNG for these anyhow!!

S6QpB8QZaa	I have never heard of such a thing. I have ABneg blood and my doctor told me that if I wanted I could have 10 kids (not that I am going to try that). The only thing with neg blood types is that it can cause antibodies if the babies blood is positive which can be prevented with a Rhogam shot. I have already had a Rhogam shot this pregnancy due to some light bleeding. I think I would have a second opinion done.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	The only thing I can think about is you being RH-negative, especially if your SO has a positive blood type. <br>  <br>  You will get a Rhogam  shot; a protein that can bind to Rh+ fetal blood cells and prevents the immune system from recognizing these fetal cells as foreign. Given to all Rh- women between weeks 28 and 29 if the father contains the Rh+ antigen.|`|2exwzXiBaa	There is no limit.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that you receive your RHogm shot during the pregnancy and if the baby is positive blood type you need to receive it after.  As long as you have not developed antibodies during any of the pregnancies, you will be fine.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	well i don't see the logic but i would trust your doctor over us on here.<br>  B's not even the rarest type, i believe AB- is.<br>  maybe because most people are O (like myself) than B's as a less common  type would have more complications|`|i8Ch743Laa	I've never heard of such a thing. I've never heard of a mom's blood type determining how many kids she can have. I'd ask a different doctor.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	You can have as many babies as you want.  I do not know what your doctor is talking about.  My blood type is A- and I do know that you must have the Rhogam shot in case your babies blood is different from your own (ie positive).  I would do what the first answer said and get a second opinion, I have never heard of a limit on the number of children you can have based on your blood type.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Um... I've never heard of such a thing.  Since you're RH factor is negative you may have to get the Rhogam shot but that's if the father is RH positive.  I would get a second opinion, that just sounds crazy to me.|`|3vWpUXsmaa	I have B negative blood and I have never heard such a thing.

I believe some kids just go through a phase of shorts and you just do what you can to ride it out but having a supportive and helpful spouse would have made all the difference in the world to me.|`|7iIh5QmOaa	i would try warm bath in nighttime bath from johnson and johnson in the morning and night. this will calm them down and if he is napping dont let him nap after 12pm this may help and dont let him sleep more than an hour. this way at night he will be more rested. when you want to put him down give him a good feeding, then bathe him possibly even lotion him with same time of scent the lavender bedtime stuff and then he just may sleep. plus this might be something to talk to your pediatrican about.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I wouldn't let them cry it out at this age either.  It sounds like your baby likes to sleep when there is some sort of motion around him?  Have you tried putting him in  a vibrating chair or swing to see if that helps?  With my son and daughter we had a vibration unit on the bassinet and it was the only thing that kept them asleep.  There were nights I would strap my son in his bouncy/vibrating chair and cover him up and put him in the middle of the bed!  They make vibration units that you can put in the crib (I bought one at Target and have seen them at Babies R Us).  We just put my 3 1/2 month old daughter in her crib this weekend for the first time.  I actually dismantled the bassinet and took the vibration unit off and put in her crib.  It worked like a charm!  Good luck, I know what sleep deprivation does to a person!|`|WhPVEnk1aa	my baby cousin is the same he only sleeps about 2 hours a day but is still not tired ever my aunt spoke to the doctor and aparently it is psycological but not an illness as such but more of a diffrence in his mind. maybe try just making him tired by wearing him out before bed. hope this helped.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|4pXQxKMbaa	I just have to say that the first person to answer must have stayed exhausted! Babies aren't supposed to keep eating in the middle of the night when they are that old! Babies can safely start sleeping through the night at 6-8 weeks old. That's what my daughter has done and she is 4 months old now and still sleeps from 9:30 to 5:30 easily!! I'm not saying that all babies DO sleep through the night at that point, but don't allow your baby to continue to get you up all the time when they are 1 year old!! <br>  As for your problem, I agree with you that it is probably just a phase he's going through that you'll have to get past. Have you tried giving him a pacifier? I know it's not the best solution, but it's better than you having to be with him all the time or having to hear him toss and turn while you should be resting. I know when I was visiting family and my daughter slept in the same room as me I didn't get very good sleep because I could hear every movement my daughter made and every time she briefly stirred.
fYMWDQLGaa	DNA test would help it. <br>  <br>   i dont want to hurt you.But here is a question.why would you do this to a person who would want to have a baby with you? there are many more TTCers who prays and cries longing just to see a positive pregnancy test. please dont cheat on anyone, esp the one who loves u most, i pity ur husband.<br>  <br>  good luck on ur future and ur baby.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	sounds like the small dot you had was implantation bleeding, not a period. You will have no way of determining who the father is unless you get a DNA test done. You had sex way to close with two different people for anyone to even take a guess at it.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You'll have to wait until the baby is born to know who the father is. Why are you cheating on your husband? That's horrible!

Sounds to me like you need to change your lifestyle just a bit and treat your guy the way you want to be treated. Now the question is did you tell your husband some other farmers been adding manure to your mans field? If not,  are you going to or do you intend to let him discover the dandelions in his rose patch? Either way I’m glad you’re not my girl. Like the first poster said, let us know when you’ll be on Jerry, I’ll set my VCR timer.|`|QsC3qGkOaa	better for you now you have a baby. just let the baby know your husband is the father.... simple. <br>  you will know when you see the baby .... resemblance can tell|`|wGCCMjVsaa	i hope they both leave you! cheatin slutt, you will end up a lonely women, but the dad still has rights too see the kid, good luck you will need it trust me|`|gUCjkj9oaa	only sure way to know is a dna test, and you might want to tell both guys about it.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	I wouldn't be as excited if I were you.

oWAUb6vpaa	You need to stop babysitting already - you need this last week or two to rest - you can go into labor any day now, seriously. <br>  <br>  You really do not need to be bending down at your waist - also it sounds like the baby is too heavy for you (probably more than 15 lbs. and that's a lot for you now.) <br>  <br>  Your friend should be more considerate of you at this time - she knows what it is to be pregnant and how your body feels towards the end, she's fully aware of how much weight you should or shouldn't be carrying. She's thinking more of herslf at this time than she is of you and that's not being a good friend. SHe probably knows you're reluctant to stop baby sitting since you feel bad and she may be taking advantage of your sensitivity, especially since she could easily say, "Well I asked you...") <br>  Please, do yourself, your baby and your husband a favor and stop babysitting ASAP - you really need this time to be taking care of yourself and allowing your body to rest and giving hubby a little peace before your baby arrives. TELL HER ASAP THAT FRIDAY IS YOUR LAST DAY - IT HAS TO BE.* <br>  <br>  Good luck, luv, and congratulations on your new baby!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	your friend is obviously sympathetic to the fact that you are pregnant and is asking you how long you are comfortable doing this for. you are obviously not comfy doing it now, so just give your friend a weeks notice so you can take the rest of the time to relax. you need all the rest you can get from this point so i would take it,|`|0e23e2c9d35238d615728b71d0eaf5b7aa	well I know its good to have a little cash coming in but you can tell your friend your concerns. <br>  <br>  Going into labor would worry me too. Then what will you do the baby pass her to a neighbor? <br>  <br>  Tell your friend that you can only do this week because its bothering your back and making you tired. but also emphasize your fear of going into labor while caring for her baby.<br>  <br>  She had a baby she should understand.|`|532XA7lkaa	If this is your first baby, do not expect to go into labor early.  With my first, I delivered at 41 weeks and even then it was induced.  I would tell her to have other care lined up for the week before your due date.  Watch the child as long as you are comfortable, but make sure she has other care in order so she doesn't get upset or in a bind.  If you are like me, there could be a good weeks cushion with that due date...and like I said...I delivered a week later.|`|MtC3CWZraa	I based my decision on when to stop working on how I felt and my weekly progress at the doctor’s office. I was due last Thursday and I’m at work through tomorrow. Everyone handles the end a little differently so you may not be able to work as long. <br>  <br>  As for the whole bending over thing – it’s easier to injure yourself while pregnant than not, but I still do things ever day that require me to bend over and the most I’ve suffered is a tired back. I’m talking about loading and unloading the dishwasher, doing laundry (which includes carrying it up and down stairs), picking up the house, scrubbing floors, etc. Last week I even slid some furniture around a room. <br>  <br>  As long as you feel like you can handle it, keep working because waiting around with nothing to do gets old real quick.|`|RvddYKqjaa	That's entirely up to you and how you feel. I don't think you have to stop everything and rest because you are having a baby soon. Women work up until their labor starts. Resting beforehand doesn't change a thing. A teaching friend of mine went on a field trip with our entire 5th grade class, walked all over DC most of the day, came home, went into labor and delivered twins. Pregnancy is not a disability. Do what you are comfortable with. Your friend has already asked you what you want to do, so tell her. Let the baby crawl around. Don't lift her if you don't have to. Also, many women make plans ahead of time as to what they will do with their first child when the second is coming along. Some even take them to the hospital, so that would be a solution if it came to that. But plan ahead, in case you go into labor today. Where would the little girl go? Talk to her mom.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If you are worried then just let your friend know that you can't babysit her anymore because you just don't want to risk going into labor while you have her and you just can't handle it right now. Your friend will understand.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Well... I went out of work when I was 38 weeks pregnant because I do lots of bending/reaching/pulling at work and it just got to be too much at that point.  I would say, when you reach 38 weeks quit babysitting. YOu need to rest.|`|nzY94B7waa	I would stop now if I were you.  You need this time to rest.|`|sqaey2Siaa	I would tell you friend that you need a little break for a few weeks before baby comes, to get some stuff you need to get done done and just REST - b/c trust me you will need all the rest you can get. Also it probably would not be a good idea to watch the friends baby for about 6 weeks after you have your baby b/c you will need that time to adjust to  your child and try to get them on a scedule somewhat.
nY05Y64maa	Try not to stress too much, usually many of those symptoms don't show up in pregnancy right away such as cravings and urinating frequently.  The more pregnant you become the more you will pee as the baby presses down on the bladder, it shouldn't be a sudden thing.  Stressing over thinking you may be pregnant might make your period even more late and because you're stressing over it you may be having psychosomatic symptoms of things you are 'noticing' that may be different.  Like I said, try not to stress over it and if you are really concerned go to the clinic and get bloodwork done or wait a few more days before trying another HPT.  If you scheduled yourself in for a doctors appointment I'm sure they take your privacy into account if you explained to your doctor what your concerns are.  Good luck:)|`|NlYGbqnkaa	I would have to say after 2 pregnacy tests and a doctors apts. You're not pregnant. I don't know what else it could be but those test aren't usually wrong. And never 2 times in a row.|`|cswHfmFdaa	some of the symptoms of pregnancy are the same syptoms of menstrating. like headaches, backaches, cravings alott. your probly fine|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well first off if you go to the doctor the only thing that will come up on the insurance is that you went to the doctor not why you went. For all your mom knows you could have gone to get a pap smear. Now if you are late on your period and still getting negative results then chances are you aren't pregnant. But there is still a chance you are and it's just not picking it up. You need to see a doctor so you know for sure and I'm sure they'll give you a blood test. It may also be your body just going through changes. You're 18 so your body is going to be changing a lot and it may just be irregular again. See a doctor for sure though. Good luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Could be.|`|AA11637393	first of all you can't read anything into these body symptoms.  Hunger, urinating etc can vary so much and body symptoms usually don't start until much later in pregnancy.  Go to the clinic and ask for a blood test.  It shouldn't be expensive and it more accurate than HPT.
vue9NOhYaa	Babies, like adults, can be sensitive to anything. So yes, he might be allergic to, or just be reacting badly to the macrobid. (Antibiotics can make adults nauseus, for example. So it may affect baby the same.)  Or it could be something else. (Teething, growth spurt, ear infection, etc.) <br>  <br>  Macrobid is usually prescribed for 5-7 days, so you're almost done with the pills. I'd probably just stick it out. (Try taking your pills just after nursing, to minimize the amount that gets into the milk.)  But if you need to have it prescribed again in future, ask the doctor for a different antibiotic. <br>  <br>  And, of course, if baby doesn't get better soon, check with the doc to be sure something else isn't wrong.|`|iwYu32N2aa	You will got better answers from a doctor then people on YA, I suggest that you call yours and ask.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well if the doctor told you that the macrobid didn't get into the breast milk then I don't think it can affect your baby. Maybe your baby is just cranky. You can always call your doctor and run your question by them. Good luck!
uFrqC4Y2aa	If you have your period you're not pregnant. But if you want go ahead...|`|uuHPneEcaa	just wait until after ur period is over. U can still have a period and be pregnant. Just wait until this one is over then take a test. U could just have it in ur mind that ur pregnant. U may not even be. <br>  <br>  U can have one more period before u get a positive pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  my ex's mother had a period while pregnant with him and his older sister and they are both perfectly healthy.\<br>  <br>  (I don't know why I am getting thumb downs. because its possible.)|`|HOdblqIkaa	Take the test a few days after your period or wait till the next one is supposed to come  it is possible to have your period while your pregnant tho.|`|SIp415MFaa	it doesn't sound silly you can have a period and still be pregnant. its worth doing a test or going to your gp.<br>  Good luck|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Well you could try but if you have your period then the chances of being pregnant are very slim x|`|0lwGsRNqaa	If you are on your period it means you are not pregnant.|`|AEyztU2laa	Having your period will not have any affect on the test itself - if you have a high enough level of the hormone that the stick tests for (hCG) it will still be positive, period or not.  If it's not high enough it will be negative, period or not.<br>  <br>  Given you do have your period it is extremely unlikely that you're pregnant, however doing a test now is fine if you want to convince yourself.  It will still be accurate.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	You can always try it. It's not going to affect the results but if you're on your period then chances are slim that you are pregnant.

5EiShLZZaa	My son was "sunny side up" :)   I was induced, I was 10 days over due because there were signs the placenta was giving up, but went epidural free, despite my OB's recommendations...the position doesn't mean you'll go post term, I was posterior, my mom had me two weeks early.  Having a posterior just makes pushing baby out very difficult, I pushed for 1 1/2 hours. I found the most effective way to push was sitting on the toilet (some hospitals have a birthing chair, mine didn't) and on all fours (very unflattering,but you'll do what you have to).  Good luck!|`|MtC3CWZraa	Your baby could easily flip around when he finally engages.

Posterior babies are harder to birth though, so it is good to try and encourage him to turn. Sounds like you have the right idea by getting on all fours...that's what my midwife recommends too.

145RUNQHaa	The squealing is just that he's discovered his vocal cords and he's just practising them no harm in it don't make a big deal out of it.he's a little young for time out at this age it makes things worse.your son's hitting and biting himself is normal for his age it doesn't mean he has a horrible temper he is suffering from extreme frustration.put yourself in his shoes imagine how horrible you would feel inside if you felt the need to bite yourself.don't force him to speak it's making him frustrated that could delay his speech if anything.best way to help him to speak is chat to him a lot and point things out and say what they are he'll pick things up that way without pressure and learn in his own time.if he hits you need to just hold his hands say no hitting and distract him show him the birds out of the window or whatever grabs his attention.try to work out what frustrates him and avoid it.if he does something you don't like distract him from it and you could later take him back to what he did wrong and you make a little game out of showing him what should have done instead.if he made a mess encourage don't force him to help you tidy up and if he makes and effort praise him well.if he's hit someone encourage him to kiss the area better praise him if he does this teaches him empathy.let him see you acting in a calm and gentle manner at all times he will pick up on that eventually children always learn by example.if he has a tantrum just let him know that a hug waits when he calms then just get on with what you were doing and when he's calmed hug him and say well done for calming himself down.give him plenty of time he's only one it will be a long time before he's learned self control.hope this helps.|`|pgBHEesTaa	I agree with amber and know ignoring this behavior helps but act normal as if everything is as usual, it is heart breaking but after a few days the child does realise that it is of no use and stops automatically, once he does, do not discuss his behavior again and act normal the loving parent you have always been|`|1h5RpINNaa	Don't react to the screaming, he will continue doing it if you give him attention positive or negative.  Once your attention is on something else while he is screaming like that the fun will go away from the scream.  As for the hitting, give him a strong no, we don't hit and remove him from the situation whether it be across the room or in the playpen.  Than when he is done throwing his fit and is calmer teach him about gentle hands by just taking your hand and rubbing his arm  while telling him, "Gentle." Have him do it back to you.  I had to do this with my now 4 year old, when she was one.  Some kids are just naturally aggressive.|`|AA12020110	is he is pain?  Maybe a trip to the doctor is in order to make sure that everything is ok with him.    He doesn't have many words and may not be able to tell you if he hurts.  You also need to tell the doctor about this behavior.  In detail.<br>  <br>  He is NOT too young for time out.  Put him in his room and shut the door.  He can come out when he is through screaming.   He is in an intense learning place and if he figures out that no one is watching he may stop.   Kids crave attention.   they crave structure and boundaries.  being in his room by himself is not going to hurt him.  Don't put him his crib, just in his room and tell him<br>  When you can stop screaming and hitting you can come out.  Kids scare themselves with temper.  They have to learn _they_ have to find oout how to calm down.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, cocooning can help. wrapping him tightly in a small blanket and rocking him may help too.|`|Hhifw93laa	First of all he is 12 months 1 year he is not to old for time out he can go there for 1 min! A child has to be hit or see hitting to know how to hit if that makes sense. Do you spank him? does the baby sitter spank him or does the baby sitter spank other children around him? when he bites him self tell him that that's biting and its wrong your words are more powerful then anything also when he screams what do you do? Do you tell him to stop? Do you yell back? One thing that I found help full (oh yeah I have 4 kids and my first one acted like yours does) is to walk away don't show him any attention at all when he screams walk in to another room or put him in another room make sure you can NOT be seen or heard it will be hard but it will work you just have to stay on it YOU have to be incontrole there is nothing wrong with him or you.

Keep in mind until you have enough hcg in your system you will not get a positive pregnancy test.  I was around 5 weeks late for my period when I finally got a positive pregnancy test.  Best of luck to you!<br>  <br>  I would re-test in a few days from now. . .|`|xpstigPTaa	Sounds like your pregnant. I would call the doctor and request a blood pregnancy test. They are the most accurate! I wish you the best of luck!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	You tested way too early last time, you need to test now.<br>  If your chest has grown that much, chances are you are pregnant, the hormones make them swell so obviously there is enough to change your body drastically so there will most likely be enough to show on a test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
8t8NjjnVaa	Oddly enough, your MIL is right.<br>  <br>  Cold medicines should not be used on a baby.  Besides, they do not help cure a cold.  It only relieves the symptoms a little, but the cold is still there.  It's just something her immune system needs to fight off by itself.  <br>  <br>  Cold medicines can be dangerous for a baby and can actually make a cold last longer.  <br>  <br>  If you're talking about Mylicon gas drops, those are fine for babies.  Infant Tylenol is okay too if the baby is really miserable.  But no cold medicines for a baby.<br>  <br>  Take your daughter to the doctor to make sure it's just a virus.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I'd like to know where you got infant medicine because they don't sell that on the shelves anymore. Check the label again. I bet you have toddler medicine. Kudos to the MIL for stopping you.<br>  <br>  If it is that big of  concern you need to take your baby to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Also I need to add although I think it is commendable of your MIL to stop you from giving your baby medicine I do have to add remember this is YOUR baby and she can't dictate what you do and how you raise your child.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you need to draw a line in the ground right now.|`|thoMmZAvaa	Your pediatrician wouldn't recommend it at all, the current stand on OTC children's cold medicine is that it shouldn't be used at all. The levels of ephedrine and tylenol in the medicines have caused some serious issues with effecting their heart rates significantly and increased risk of overdose when parents give multiple OTC (like cold medicine and tylenol at the same time). The view is that the issues that the cold medicines are addressing are symptoms not the actual cold/virus and that risk isn't worthwhile. The best thing to do is keep her hydrated and discuss the situation with your pediatrician (someone who's been trained for this) /office triage nurse. They'll certainly see you, but colds aren't always infections, many times their viruses', for which there is no treatment.|`|mCbe2a67aa	What kind of medicine? Cold and Cough medicine? Or only tylenol and motrin? Infant tylenol (acetaminophen) or Motrin (Ibuprofen) are perfectly fine to give your baby, as long as you are giving the proper dosage. However, infant cold medicines and cough medicines are not safe for your baby and will do more harm than good. So your MIL is correct in that respect. <br>  <br>  If your baby is miserable try using a cold mist humidifier, or take her into the bathroom and run the shower for a while. Also, try to make sure she is eating. Offer her food more often than you usually would as fluids are important when she's sick.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I would take her to a doctor and then take their advice on what to do/give her.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Call the Doctor.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Hard to say without knowing how old your baby is, and what infant medicine you mean.  If it is just gas drops or something, fine.  But if you are talking about an equivalent to Tylenol cold, than absolutely not.  Some of those start at 2 years, but the rest are not until 6 years old.  So it is hard to say based on what information you gave, or didn't give rather.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Infant gas drops are totally safe, even at 1 month old.  My son would not have made it without those! He had to have a drop of them after every bottle he drank, and every meal he ate for the first 15 months of his life.  I would tell her that you appreciate her advice, but that it is your baby and therefore you know your daughter and her needs better than she does.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	I would take her to a doctor. If its a cold the medicine is just easing her symptoms not not really curing anything and there have been some new studies saying you shouldn't give new babies medicine because of this and the side effects it could cause. Which is probably why she doesn't want  you giving her medicine. But i would go to the doctor if she's getting worse. good luck|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	If your baby is young then you need to make a doctors appointment. The medication that you are talking about is it mylicon drops? It is okay to give this for gas. You said that your child has been sick since you came home from the hospital so because the baby is still an infant your pediatrician needs to be called and see the child.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	What kind of medicine did you get? As far as I know, there aren't any  infant cold medicines..and dr's will even tell you not to give them any medicine for it..only tylenol if they have a fever.<br>  With a cold all you can do is wait it out..use a nasal aspirator if they have a stuffy nose, or a cool mist humidifier.<br>  <br>  But you shouldnt be giving tylenol or infant motrin for a cold..if you are...thats not what those are for.<br>  ..and if your baby has gas..try mylicon gas drops..or gripe water.|`|tLGbtmGsaa	She has no say in the matter.  Just do what you think is best.  You are mother, not she.  If you are afraid that she will find out then give the medicine when she is not around.  I cannot stand it when my mother tells me how to bring up my children so I know how you feel.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	call ur pediatrician and ask what you should do.<br>  as for your mother in law, dont worrt about it. the baby is yours, not hers so you get to make the decisions. tell her to butt out.|`|T0gv52CDaa	If your mother-in-law is not a doctor, then you should talk to one and follow that person's advice.  If you were talking about cold medicine, then I would say she is right, in light of all of the recent studies on children and cold medicine, but my son's pediatrician had me start giving him infant Gas-X when he was about a month old because he was so miserable with gas, and it made a world of difference.  He went from being fussy and screaming all the time to being the happiest most pleasant baby you will ever meet.  At 3 1/2 months, he is able to burp & fart on his own now, so doesn't need the Gas-X very often any more, but it was a life saver when he was smaller.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	It's your baby...you do what you think is best. Some moms don't want to give their babies medicine if it's not serious and if the baby doesn't have a fever....but some moms believe that medicine is better than having the baby suffer from the cold and everything else that comes with it. Ultimately it's not your mother in laws choice or decision...I know this is kind of rude...but my opinions come from my own experience from my annoying MIL. If your mother in law has nothing to do but annoy you and be in your space and face about how to take care of your baby....then she needs to go fill her empty space up and go get her own baby. What's she getting mad at you for...you're just trying to do what you think is best...she needs to shut her mouth and leave you to care for your own baby.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	babies do get sick but if yours has been sick since you brought her home, maybe a trip to the doctor would be best. Infant tylenol is the only thing basically children under 2 can have now a days. <br>  as for the MIL, its your baby, not hers, so who cares about her anger. I would just take the baby to the doctor for a check up to see what he says and go by that.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	I think that you need to take her to the doctor!! She doesnt sound very old and in the first 3 months there not spose to have medicine it sounds like a viral infection and it will clear up on its own and nothing will cure it!!! i could be wrong but i do think if shes not keeping anything down she needs to go to the doctor when my son was 3wks old and couldnt keep anything down and i have to feed him his bottle every 15mins 1/2oz so he would keep it down.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	im sorry...did you say she wouldnt LET you? it is your child isnt it? you do as you please, you dont need her permission. if your baby is miserable, do whatever you need to to make her feel better.|`|3m40DbqNaa	How old is your baby?  Read the dosage chart on the medicine and see if she's in the correct age range to take it. It's very easy to overdose an infant (they should never be given medicine made for older babies) and cold medicine can't be bought over the counter for young babies anymore.  Call her pediatrician and ask what she can be given, and how much. What is your MIL saying "no" to?  Cough/cold medicine or medicine for gas (which is fine for infants)?   You are the mother of this baby, she can't tell you what you can and cannot do, but depending on the medicine, she may be right.  I hope your baby feels better!<br>  EDIT* I just read that the medicine MIL said "no" to is gas medicine.  That's fine for infants. She may not have given her own children medicine, which was her right, but she shouldn't be telling you that you "can't" give this to your own baby.  If you let her tell you what you can/can't do, she'll do it more and more. Put your foot down now. You are the mom, and you know what's best. Take her advice only when you agree. If you're unsure, get a 2nd opinion.|`|yea2hci5aa	I used the same drops for my daughter.  She's currently 12 months old and is just fine.  The doctor will even tell you that it's perfectly safe to give to her.  It's a good thing your mother in law is not the mother and although it may seem rude you may need to remind her of that fact.  If you feel uncomfortable telling her then talk to your husband and have him do the dirty work.  There's nothing worse then someone else critiquing your parenting. <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything and I hope your baby is feeling better soon
lY2XI8kUaa	i think pedisure is something that you give to your child when he/she wont eat.  this may be the reason that she is taking less at lunch. pedisure is heavy, but i don't think it will cause constipation

654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	A really cool thing that doesn't cost too much might be one of those bed tents...they sit on top of the bed and the kid is inside...and they can be lifted right off...<br>  <br>  Poor little fella and his care-givers are in for a long haul!  Perhaps some books on tape from the store....but also, why don't some family members take a few minutes to read the books he has that he loves onto a tape, or even video tape themselves reading the book...<br>  <br>  That would save money and mean even more...I know when my son was 4 and had his tonsils out, he loved shark books, and well, because of those giant scary teeth, etc. I never could find any books on tape that deal with giant sea creatures that eat other sea creatures! (grinning here)<br>  <br>  The key to keeping him happy is rotating things--make up some "busy bags" with a few different toys, books, etc. in each one, and give him one at a time...and rotate them.<br>  <br>  If his folks don't have a set of walkie-talkies, that might be a great gift...they can be used to commicate with him, such as from the kitchen when asking him what they can bring back...and for fun when trying to keep him entertained...<br>  <br>  I would also try to include any toys that are age-appropriate--wooden puzzles and chunky puzzles are good for that age, and he can do them many times over before getting bored, especially if they are rotated....<br>  <br>  If the family has a laptop, there are many software programs that are for the two-year-old and up set....I am sure he could get some fun and learning out of some of those...babies are so smart these days...and let's not forget music!  If you know of anyone who plays guitar and is willing, have them come over and play some simple kid songs and sing with him.  My kids always loved it when their daddy played guitar.<br>  <br>  Also, he will need a sturdy bed-tray to set over top of his lap...not one of those flimsy metal ones made for kids, but a solid wooden one that will not turn over on him...<br>  <br>  Best wishes to the little guy, and to all who will be caring for him...it will not be an easy six weeks!|`|Hhifw93laa	hand heald leapster they have then wound enough my daughter is 2 and loves them Im so sorry to hear about this how did a 2 year old fall 5 feet? was he is gymnasticks or foot ball? again im sorry for this but i hope he gets better soon toys that make a lot of noise and coloring books stuff like that!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	bring a game adnd make  a goal to go a bd play with him as much as you can <br>  porr little guy hope he is ok|`|uj1A73ZGaa	You can get him:<br>  <br>  Lots of picture books and maybe some pop up books(my oldest daughter loves the pop up books)<br>  <br>  You can get the books that come with a tape or cd and they can play the tape that goes with the book.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2383362" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a> (my oldest daughter has this and she loves it)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2658700(" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a> this is a cool toy too it teaches them different rhymes and music.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA12020110	Color crayons, cartoon videos, stuffed toys, cars, blocks, blocks would be good.  colored blocks especially.  stacking toys, check out Hasbro..<br>  <br>  Ask his mom what she thinks he might like.

6Gm7TFQ4aa	If you are, you better do something about it fast. 22 is way too young to raise a child. Live your life first, then start a family.|`|BPckjS68aa	Not necessarily. My girl friend (who oddly enough is 22) was having this exact same problems about two weeks ago. Her breasts were constantly in pain. I think the described them as more or less sore than anything else. But this went one for several days. Obviously we got a little worried so we went and got a test which came up negative. So we waited. I think it was probably about a week until they stopped hurting. <br>  <br>  The part that neither one of us got was that her breasts did get a little bigger. Not a cup size or anything like that. But just a bit bigger. The only real advice I can give you is to go out and get a test.<br>  <br>  Hope this puts a little peace to your mind|`|AA10949869	Well, if you have had unprotected sex(or any sex at all for that matter) then yes, there is a possibility that you are pregnant. Take a test, if it is negative, wait a week and if you still have no period test again. Good luck to you.<br>  <br>  And for the person who said 22 is too young to raise a child, let her be the judge of that. I've been with my husband for 6 years and we are expecting our first child March 29th and I turned 24 in October last year...so I got pregnant at 23.|`|g6sCUoO7aa	Well, if you have had sex then yes it could be a possibility.

MW18liqTaa	I am not sure if these two methods are considered CIO. It seems like you are doing what you feel is right. You know your baby better than anyone else and your judgement is best when it comes to his cries.<br>  If I do allow some crying, it is when I really really have to use the bathroom or will be with him in just a minute. He is a newborn so I am still getting used to his cries. I am sure I will be more aware of what his cries mean soon and I can see myself taking the same steps as you.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I am not in favor of ever letting a baby cry alone for any amount of time or any reason. Sometimes babies need to cry just to relieve stress and I get that but crying while being rocked is different than crying alone in their room or alone in their crib. I think that the long CIO methods where people will not hold their baby at all are abusive. I think five minutes is not nice but I wouldn't consider it abuse necessarily. If you hold him and comfort him then lay him down and let him do the five minute cry more than once or twice I think that borders abusive to me. To me that is tormenting the baby by teasing him with comfort then taking it away as soon as he is calm. If a baby is held and cuddled and loved they will be a secure happy baby if they are left to cry how will they ever be sure they can trust the people who are ignoring them? I think parents ignore the deep scars this can cause and call it good as long as their child is not obviously horribly messed up. Emotional trauma can cause subtle problems not always huge glaring ones.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I don't see the way you do it as CIO method, I do the same, I put my daughter down for a nap and sometimes and only sometimes she'll moan, like grizzle, not scream, for 5secs and then give in and lie down to sleep. If I stay there she just gets up constantly to look at me and wont sleep, so if we leave her to settle on her own she falls asleep straight away! If she cries I go in, try and settle her without saying anything and leave the room again. <br>  <br>  In my eyes CIO is letting your baby scream the house down before being that exhausted they fall asleep. I may be wrong as I dont really know much about it, but I know if I put my daughter down and she screams I will not leave her to just fall asleep.|`|723QHuicaa	I define cry it out to be - <br>  <br>  -  allowing a child to cry themselves to sleep for an extended period of time.<br>  -  allowing the child to cry and to go by the clock as an indicator of when it is time to comfort them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your first example, no I would not consider that to be CIO - you are up and awake to meet his needs.<br>  <br>  The 2nd example is a grey area to me - you put him down knowing he is going to cry, and leave him. I couldnt do that - I have tried, and I physically cant do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  The only time my child is crying, that I do not consider to be cry it out - is when she is lying in bed, crying (never happened, but hypothetically) and I am beside her trying to settle her. If I left the room and let her get on with it on her own - yes, this would be cry it out.<br>  <br>  The reason I am against, and do not believe in CIO is that I think its particularly cruel to a baby. I have gotten through 18m without CIO - so there isnt any need for it in my household. Yes, there are times when I am sitting on the floor beside her cot, holding her hand because she will not allow to leave the room. The fact that these instances are usually related to teething or illness lets me know she isnt doing it ''to get her own way'' she needs me to hold her hand for a reason, and I'm ok with that. In my opinion, its easier to calm a moany baby, than calm a baby who has been left to cry for 15min before the clock allows mummy to go back in.<br>  <br>  My daughter is at 18m, sleeping 12hrs in her own bed at night, and self soothing through the night. Ok, it took her till 15m to get into a good sleeping pattern, but I think its unrealistic to expect young babys will sleep through the night. when they do sleep through due to cry it out, it is not a triumph of the technique, it is deep sleep induced by trauma.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	The term "Cry-It-Out" sounds very harsh. I think hearing that we automatically think of  baby sitting alone in their crib bawling their eyes out desperately hoping that mama comes back. That IS harsh. I don't agree with that what-so-ever.<br>  <br>  I believe I heard you use the term fuss-it-out once. That is more my method. I don't leap out of bed at 3:00 am if I hear a peep from his room. I like you look at the clock... lay there for a few minutes and see where it goes. Sometimes he very well just may be "sleep crying" and isn't awake at all. If the crying continues though after 5 minutes or so then I get up but I still don't rush to his bedroom. I like you pee... make a bottle... get the lazy boy arranged so I can jut pull a blanket over us and THEN I go get him.<br>  <br>  Then again we have times he doesn't want me to rock him to sleep. Obviously he is so tired so I put him in his crib with a blankie and ninny. Usually he lays on his stomach rubbing his face in the sheets for 5-10 minutes all the while "complaining" (I think you used that term before too!) Then he is out like a light.<br>  <br>  There is a big difference in letting your child scream bloody murder while you ignore them verses letting your child fuss for a bit before they fall asleep.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	When I hear my daughter wake up during the night I'll wait to make sure she isn't going to fall back to sleep. I don't count to 100, but it's probably an accurate time-frame for how long I wait as well. <br>  <br>  The only other thing I've tried is putting my daughter in her crib when she's just about to fall asleep. Turn on her music box, stand there and pat her on her bottom or rub her head. Sometimes, it'll put her right to sleep...other's she'll start to cry. I'll stand there and comfort her until her music box is finished playing...if she doesn't fall asleep. I pick her up and try it again.  I've actually recently quit doing this, because it's not been working and it's been really upsetting to me because she's getting so upset. I think when she's a year old this is the method I will perhaps start to try though.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	CIO to me, is putting your baby down to bed and shutting the door and totally ignoring crying, regardless of how long it takes.  I can't imagine many people would opt to do this.  <br>  <br>  Personally, as soon as my son cries I'll go in and either give him his dummy or pick him up.  I know I'm lucky in that we don't have a problem with him crying at bedtime or naps, and if he cries it's generally because there is something wrong i.e wind, sore mouth.  If I had a baby that couldn't get to sleep without rocking/being held, I wouldn't think I could use CIO as I've described above. I just can't hear my baby cry and leave them to it, it's just the way I am.  Too soft some might say.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	to me when people say use the cry it out method it means letting baby scream for endless amounts of time until he/she falls asleep. that i don't like to do. i did my research and what i found out is that doing things that way does more harm then good. but i wont get all into that.<br>  i basically do what you do. i don't rush right in, sometimes i let my daughter soothe herself but if the crying lasts for long periods of time (more then 15 minutes usually) then i will go in and see what the problem is. your two ways of doing things is how i handle things. but i don't think that is considered crying it out.<br>  i don't bring our daughter into bed with us because if we start doing that then she is going to think if she cries all the time that we will bring her to bed all the time.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I didn't read your other answers before answering this, so I apologize if I'm missing the inner arguments.<br>  <br>  For me, CIO in perception and often in practice (what people actually do when they say they use CIO) is letting their babies cry for a while with out comforting them.  Sometimes this will be a "five minutes to think it over" like you described, other times it will be controlled crying, other times it will be "I let my baby CIO for two minutes" etc.<br>  <br>  But, in definition, CIO is a form of sleep training that involves making sure baby is fed, dry, hopefully cuddled though not needed, and putting baby in bed until morning/end of nap.  The baby is litterally forced to cry out the duration of the sleep.  Mom does not go back in to comfort or tend at all during that period of sleep.  It's really a "you're fed, changed, now lay there and cry until you fall asleep or until it's morning/time for nap to be over, I'm not coming to help you".  *This* is what CIO is defined as.<br>  <br>  Anything short of "shut the door and leave baby alone until morning" is not technically true CIO.  Anything else is a modified version of CIO, usually called controlled crying.  Controlled crying includes Ferber's method of timed comforts, The Baby Whisperer's idea of letting a baby's cry peak and crescendo three times and fall asleep before intervening, and anything else that involves forcing a baby to cry for a period of time to try to figure out self soothing techniques.<br>  <br>  As far as "Are these methods "cry-it-out" to you, no, neither are CIO.  But, number 1 is inattentive parenting.  If your "success rate" were higher and he were falling asleep 75-80, or even 90% of the time, it would be fine.  You'd know that he didn't really need you and just needed a chance to resettle.  But, where it's just a 50/50 maybe you need to help maybe you don't, it's unresponsive and a bit neglectful.  <br>  Number 2 is kind of the same idea.  If your "sometimes he will and sometimes he won't" situation were more predictable and more standard, it would be okay.  It's fine, if a baby is tired and you can not help because helping makes it worse, to let him fuss and cry for a while while he falls asleep.  That's okay because your helping makes it worse.  But, when you don't help because you want to force him to figure it out himself, it's inattentive and unresponsive.  <br>  <br>  Babies are not manipulative, and they can not be forced to self soothe by not responding to them.  Learning how to self sooth is not a "sink or swim" situation.  It's something that has to be taught.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I do similar things to the 2nd method.  --  I put her in the crib with her paci when she is drowsy (not fully asleep) and turn her rain forest soother on.  I give her kiss and tell her that I love her.  I close the door and sit in the hall.  If she starts crying I wait 10 mins and put the paci back in her mouth, tell her it is time to go to sleep and I love her, touch her face and leave the room.  If she is still crying I wait another 10 mins and do the same thing.- I would let her cry because I know she is not wet, hungry or hurt.  I know my daughter and she LOVES to be in my arms and she wants to sleep in my arms.<br>  She is 6 months now and all I have to do it put her in the crib and she falls asleep immediately on her own!<br>  Do whatever works for you!  Good luck!  :-)|`|UghJ0XROaa	I consider CIO to be a full blown scream for however long it takes with no contact at all. I don't like that way, i would not use it, except for the 5 min you describe, which is like the figure out if i am going to go to sleep by myself first. After 5 min, anything it takes to get them to sleep is what i will do. I am fortunate and really have only ever had to use the "fuss it out" method, where they are talking, complaining and whimpering to themselves, like they are trying to get comfortable for the night, but not screaming "mommy i need you"<br>  <br>  I don't think CIO is detrimental to every baby. No study can describe every child, every method used has to be individual to the parent/child. There is no method that will work for every child. In a lot of cases, parents that use CIO have babies who are miserable all day because they are not sleeping well enough at night and if you stick to it, it works. Some babies would probably be offended and act differently with it, other babies would not let it phase them and start sleeping and not care.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I don't really allow crying without responding, although my son does fuss when he is overly tired. I often rock him to sleep, and sometimes he fusses while I hold him, but I am comforting him. Other times, I lay next to him and when he begins to protest, I'll sing a song or whisper one in his ear or blow lightly on his hair and that puts him to sleep. When he wakes up fussing, I go in with a bottle and that usually puts him right back to sleep. When he refuses the bottle and keeps fussing, I pick him up and walk around with him. I am more in line with Asher's way of thinking when it comes to crying it out.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I'd say these were 'cry it out' yes.<br>  <br>  I use both of your (very well described!) methods, and they both work for me too.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine anyone leaving their baby to cry for more than 5 minutes at a time?? Do they?? I mean, if my daughter is just sort of fussing/whinging before sleep, then I don't go to her because I know she'll fall asleep. But if she was properly crying, I wouldn't leave her more than 5 minutes without checking that everything is ok.<br>  <br>  I don't think that letting your baby cry for a few minutes will do them any harm whatsoever. Babies need a chance to go to sleep by themselves, and continually picking them up or disturbing them every time they whimper, is only going to exacerbate the problem.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I dont believe that what you are using is CIO.  I would say that is more FIO. I have always been very opposed to letting your baby scream until they are asleep CIO.  But I am not as opposed to putting your baby in bed to fuss, whine, talk, flail around whatever, until they fall asleep if they are clearly tired and have had all of there needs met.  <br>  <br>  Now me, I rock my daughter to sleep everynight but sometimes (like last night) she will wake up 1 hour after I feed her and will start crying, I will usually wait about 2 minutes before I go in to her because most of the time, she will go back to sleep on her own.  But I know the difference between COME NOW and I am awake and don't want to be cry. <br>  <br>  I think you what you are doing is great and it sounds like it is working well for your son.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	to be honest, your method is my method. i dont pick him but ill turn on his glow worm or light on the crib and give him his paci and rub his back and he will fall asleep. my little one sometimes cries when we put him down even though he is exhausted and i let him cry. my son isnt damaged or scarred from crying it out a little bit.|`|DIZKlxNraa	These are not CIO methods I would say. You are lucky it works for you, my son just starts histerical cry every time he wakes up and will cry forever if I don't nurse/rock him back to sleep at night.|`|1h5RpINNaa	I think your methods are "cry-it-out" and I use the exact same methods as you.   I think using the methods you get to know your child better, like I know my baby has tons of different cries and I know what each of them mean, so I can actually respond to her better when I can tell what she is saying through her screaming, instead of cuddling and troubleshooting!|`|6hA0O06xaa	I wouldn't put those methods in a category with CIO...not even in a grey area.  We ferberized my son at 8 months (which is one CIO method) but ever since then, we've used your methods which I'd consider normal things that most parents have to do in order to get their kids to nap.  By nature babies don't know what's best for them...so even when they're exhausted, they usually fight sleep for a bit before giving in.  I totally let my son fuss for a few minutes and 99 times out of 100, the fussing turns to babbling, and then silence and he takes a glorious nap.  If the fussing escalates, I do the re-evaluation thing, might change his diaper, read a story and have a little more quiet play to see if he's still rubbing his eyes and then try again.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	For the "5 minutes to think it over," are you saying that if he's still awake after 5 minutes, you will pick him up and try another way to get him back to sleep (other than crying in his crib)? If so, then neither are CIO. I like a term I recently heard in here, "Fuss it Out." Basically your baby is not full blown screaming, so you allow them to fuss a little in their crib in an attempt to put themselves back to sleep. <br>  <br>  <br>  I have no problems getting up in the middle of the night with my baby, or spending half an hour nursing and cuddling her until she falls asleep at night. I have nothing better to do than take care of my daughter. I knew being a mom would include spending some time to get baby to sleep at night, and loosing sleep when she gets up twice a night to eat or be held. No big deal. I'll miss that time in a couple of years when she's independant and wants nothing to do with me :)|`|T0gv52CDaa	I think it varies by age.  You don't say how old your child is, and what I would think about what you are doing would be vastly different if your child is 1 week old versus if he is 10 months old.  I think that if your child is  under 3 months, you should go to him immediately when he starts crying. That is how infants begin to learn trust.  On the other hand, if your child is older, and obviously sleepy (e.g. falling asleep as soon as you hold him but waking up the moment you put him down) then letting him cry for a few minutes to see if he will go to sleep isn't a problem.  I think letting your child scream for two hours is excessive no matter his age because if he has had his leg stuck in crib rails, or there is some other serious problem, you would feel like complete crap when you finally went in.<br>  <br>  I think Dr. Ferber's book Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, is the best on the proper way to do the cry-it-out method.  When my 1st son was 8 months old, he started waking up in the middle of the night after having been sleeping through the night for months.  I used Dr. Ferber's method, and in a week he was back to sleeping throught the night with no problems, and at 2 1/2, he is still a good sleeper.|`|l7RJkc3baa	It does not apply to our household... we run to out baby right away to give her a toy, pacifier, food, change diaper...no cry it out!<br>  <br>  We don't pick her up  tho...we try to distract with anything possible..so she doesn't depend on our hands and doesn't demand it. She is 19 weeks old, so she understand now what's good and what's not so pleasant... so less hands works for us|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I don't believe in it. Just because it breaks my heart every time my son crys and I just want to run in and make everything better for him. Yes it does sound like CIO methods ot me. Any crying which is left alone for any period of time to me is CIO. It bothers me the most you get parents who have babies that are only a few weeks old and they want to use the CIO method. It isn't supposed to be used till 6 months. We will never use it. There are just too many reasons as to why I hate it. The most important being that it can leave such horrible psychological effects both short term and long term for the baby. Its also their only form of communication to you and ignoring it tells them that is isn't working. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.phdinparenting.com/2008/07/05/no-cry-it-out/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phdinparenting.com/2008/07/05...</a>

dDVAUA9saa	It's odd that your doctor would say you should feel it that early.  Usually with your first they say between 18 and 22 weeks.<br>  <br>  I felt my first baby move at exactly 20 weeks.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	If your a first time mom its hard for you to distinguish between the babies movement and lets say gas so they baby might already be moving enough for you to feel it but you cant tell the difference. With my daughter I didnt feel her til like 18-19 weeks I think but this one I've been feeling since VERY early on like 9 weeks and its probably because I know the difference and because its apparently a big baby lol|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I'm a little chunky, I first felt flutters around 18 week. I got a few good kicks around 20 weeks, but felt mostly flutters still. Around week 22 or 23  is when I was feeling constant kicking. Now I and 29 weeks and feel her all of the time.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Overweight women have a longer period of time before they feel movement. I felt my first movement with my first pregnancy at 16 weeks,with my second at 13 1/2.  If the baby's right on schedule,calm down and you'll feel it as soon as you're supposed to! You'll feel it as soon as it's ready to make it's apperance and be felt!|`|98WKYtfwaa	I'd been feeling slight movements from about 15weeks. When i was nearly 18weeks the movements were becoming more regular. <br>  <br>  It's different for everyone though, some feel nothing until 24weeks.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	at 18 weeks i started feeling movement i never felt fluttering though,i got a really big kick.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	My first son didn't move until 6 months or so.   And more by 7 and 8 months.  He was a 10 month baby.<br>  I guess he was comfortable.<br>  <br>  My second son moved much earlier - and NEVER STOPPED!!!!!  Like never - he moved when I was moving, he moved when I was resting.  Now he has ADHD so I'm guessing he was like that from the start!!!! ;-)<br>  Although he was a 10 month baby too - he was bulging out of my stomach by 8 and 9 and 10 months and you could see imprints of feet and hands and stuff - it freaked out friends and family ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  I love them both - if you don't feel anything by 7 months I'd get seen - but usually I'd guess 6 months is the norm.|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	I didn't feel the baby until I was exactly 20 weeks. I'm not overweight at all though. I've actually heard its a lot harder to feel the baby if your overweight. Some women don't feel the baby until 24 weeks. Don't worry its to early to be feeling it. The doctor asked me at my 16 week appt if i'd felt him yet, and she said I would soon, but it took 4 weeks. Everyone is different, you'll feel it soon enough.|`|uLLQovSyaa	I don't remember the exact time but with my 1st one I had began to feel little flutters and I wasn't sure if that was it or not.During my ultrasound he kicked and we heard it on the monitor and I felt the flutter so I knew then what I'd been feeling.Don't worry it'll get stronger!lol! When I got bigger/further along I used to lay down and raise my shirt and my whole belly would shift and stuff with his moving around.lol!|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I was 24.4 weeks when I found out I was pregnant so that is around the time when it "clicked" and I realized that's what I was feeling.  I think I was around 20 weeks when she actually started moving.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned just yet.  It will basically at this point, just feel like gas.  I'm overweight too and I do think that has a factor on how you feel what's going on inside.  Good luck!|`|1fuyVMYMaa	I felt mine start moving at around 15 weeks pregnant which is early for a first pregnancy, they say for first time mums they usually start feeling movement anywhere from 18-22 weeks.|`|cnIzqEoDaa	You should be feeling them soon. It's a little hard to distinguish the kicks at first. They may feel like gas or little flutters. Don't worry, you will notice it in the next few weeks.

i8Ch743Laa	I agree totally with you!!!! I will say,that you've brought up some excellent points. Women are far too into themselves and how they look that they'd rather get an abortion than a baby bump,or worry so much about what people are thinking,that pregnant women everywhere are going to need to be on a safe nerve med before it's all done and over lol. I think women worry far too much what other people say about them anyways. I know that the biggest fear is that their men/husbands won't be into them,and that's a totally inaccurate fear. I know my husband is JUST as into me,it's not mattering,and I know it will continue to be this way,because we've been through it before. If a man is going to lose interest in a woman because she's carrying HIS child,then that man is a shallow piece of crap in my opinion. Just wanted to say I totally agree with your points!!! People are worried to gain more than like 20 lbs when pregnant,I gained 70 lbs when I was pregnant with my daughter,guess what? It all came off.|`|0rDDPTi5aa	Wow, that is sad to call someone pregnant fat!!  This world is obsessed with weight.  About two years ago, I lost 20 pounds and I remember thinking, man, if I get pregnant( I'm 35 so my clock is ticking, lol)  I'm gonna gain all that weight back!!  It's horrible that I would even feel that way.<br>  <br>  Just look at all the pressure on stars to lose all the "baby fat" within weeks of giving birth.  It's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  I forgot to say its dangerous to gain TOO much weight during pregnancy, it can cause diabetes, high blood pressure, pre eclampsia.  I used to work in the prenatal clinic of the Health Dept.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	You've never been pregnant so you don't know how you would react to gaining weight. Most pregnant woman who call themselves fat probably have a bad self image anyway. It's hard if you don't like your body to begin with and to gain weight on top of it can be very hard for some people. I know I am having a very hard time this time around with my changing body. I retain water when I'm pregnant and my ankles are no longer ankles...everything looks bigger. Of course I feel fat. It's nice to think that you may really enjoy growing a belly and feeling beautiful anyway...which is great, but who knows how you'll carry or if you'll gain weight in places you don't want it to be.|`|sLkruqYVaa	definitely rediculus that pregnant women get called fat but believe me when you're pregnant you do feel bloated and you do FEEL fat even if it isn t the case  <br>  oh and you'll get sick of people cooing over your bump too oh my god and wanting to touch your bump i don t go around touching peoples belly's and it doesn t seem right to have some stranger do it to me|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I actually find that people look at me a little funny but never outright say anything because they don't want to assume I'm pregnant and find out I just have a Santa Belly!<br>  <br>  They usually wait for me to say, yes, I'm six months pregnant before saying "Oh I thought so but didn't want to hurt your feelings if you weren't"<br>  <br>  People are morons.

758cDKEFaa	yeha spinach is very high in iron especially if ate raw which im assuming you are.<br>  your right also to be drinking juice high in vitamin c as it will help your body absorb the iron as you've said.|`|b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	Yep, spinach is a great source of iron (100g provides 4.0mg of iron). But even better sources are chickpeas (200g provide 6.2 mg of iron) and bran flakes with semi-skimmed milk (45g provide 5.4 mg of iron). <br>  <br>  You're spot on with consuming vitamin C to help the body absorb the iron more efficiently.

fR5vfbKGaa	I bled Thur my pregnancy the whole 9 months  not a regular period but a little more than just spotting. I had no cramps etc. and the doctor told me he didn't know where it was coming from he told me not to worry  because I had a " good pregnancy "  ( the baby was fine )hope this helps.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	i started bleeding at 5 weeks, went to bathroom and wiped and there was red blood. everyday until i got insurance i bled, around 7 weeks (still bleeding) i saw dr, had ultrasound and checked cervix, everything was fine. well needless to say i bled every single day until i was 12 weeks pregnant. red blood w/ sometimes thick clots, i was so scared all the time and i even cramped w/ the bleeding. Well i am going on 17 weeks now and i had thing of bleeding 3 weeks ago for a minute and thats it, had a ultrasound, they dont know why i was bleeding, my placenta is really high and attatched the baby is fine, and the cord is fine and the aminoic fluid is fine, and my cervix is really long and closed, so who knows!!! its not always bad like people on here say, i remember asking someone about the spotting and they almost all said sorry your going to lose the baby, as if they knew<br>  <br>  good luck =)|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Not me!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i have a subchorionic hemorrhage in my uterus and am bleeding through my pregnancy. it's very scary, as if the baby detaches from my uterus completely i will miscarry. the first time i went to the bathroom and found blood i flipped out, i was petrified, i've had 2 prev. miscarriages and both started with light bleeding. now when i bleed, it's not as dramatic, because at least i know why it's happening. i hope that eventually the placenta will reattach completely to my uterus and the bleeding will stop.|`|LQnKhiVMaa	for the first 24 weeks i bled every 4 weeks on the dot, it only lasted upto 4 hrs, was very light pinky red, and i had no pain at all, it was prob no more than 2 tea spoons full, and completely stopped at 24 weeks.. midwife and dr did not know where it was coming from, it was not a period, it was just a coincidence, it happened every 4 weeks|`|le0LsiVUaa	It happens, you just deal with it.|`|o3P4Ldfqaa	My Sister Bled Very bad when she was having her second son, she had to go on warfrin jabs which thinned her blood.

a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	If you test too early, the hcg level may not be high enough for hpt to detect so the best is to wait till you missed for at least a wk b4 you test with first morning pee.. GL|`|qmkXcbjPaa	im sorry but i dont think ur pregnant srry|`|iBWcAw4Oaa	Hey hun, I am in same boat as u. I tested 15 DPO and my AF is 4 days late, and i got a BFN. They say that sometimes a HPT wont detect pregnancy up untill you are 8 weeks. I think you should defo wait untill a few days after you miss your AF, else you may get a false negative. I know how hard it is but its better to wait if you can. I hope that you are PG and good luck to you. I have my fingers and toes crossed for you. ^^baby dust^^ <br>  <br>  Keep me posted!! :D<br>  <br>  x x x.
cnIzqEoDaa	It is normal to not feel pregnant early on. Most people don't start showing until around 14 weeks (on average).. sometimes sooner and sometimes later. I would stop cleaning the kitty litter, you are probably fine right now though.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	My last period was on november also and am almost 4 months so you should be closed to that. you can get prenatal vitamins from any pharmacy their the same ones as the doctor gives you. You take one a day. About the junk try to cut it down but dont worry too much we tend to eat what doesnt it make us sick and thats normal. You need to stop cleaning the litter and if you dont have a choice you have to wear a face mask and gloves then wash your hands very thoroughly after. Avoid any house hold cleaning liquids if you have no gloves because the body will absorb them and pass it to the baby. My sister didnt found out she was preg until she was 3 1/2 months both times the babies were fine. Your belly can feel hard at anytime every pregnancy is different. The baby should be fine if you only had menstrual like cramps those are very normal and you havent had any bleeding your okay. But you should get to the doctor soon prenatal care is very important for the babys health as well as your own.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	if you had a miscarraige you would pass clots of blood and have severve cramps. what ypur describing is normal. yes the kitty litter is dangerous to your unborn child so stop. i was 8 weeks when i found out with my first successful pregnancy and only took folic acid for 4 weeks. m belly was never really hard with my forst dont worry about it.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	relax! you wont be able to feel any difference in your stomach for a while. also you might want to have someone else change the kitty litter because the amonia in it is whats bad for you and your baby. have you taken a hpt yet? are you sure you're pregnant? if you aren't sure, just relax! go take a hpt so you will know for sure :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	WIth my daughter I didn't go to docs. till I was almost 4 months. I could get insurance , you know what I think I was further than that. <br>  Finally I was just to worried and I went to a free type clinic to get checked out. You can go to planned parenthood they are pretty cheap or find a free clinic , its easier to find some kind of medical help when you are pregnant. <br>  I wouldn't get to worried your belly doesn't get hard till bout 5+ months right? Depending on your size. If you are really skinny it will happen quicker , if you are heavy then it will be later. <br>  Do not clean the kitty box while pregnant! no one can do it for you? INvest in one that cleans it self then! <br>  Menstrual like cramps are normal at the beginning , at least what my doc told me , its your body adjusting to what is going on in there. <br>  If it is really severe then no that's no good at all. <br>  Has there been any blood? <br>  Go to the doc , if you haven't had period since march you are already like 4 months you need to go to docs. You can already know the sex. I know when I waited I got lectured by every doctor I seen. Its not good. Go to drug store and get some prenatal to ... maybe iron also you need to take care of your self and baby
yea2hci5aa	Well everyone's different but those 2 symptoms are VERY common.  Since your body is working over time helping your little one grow you feel more tired than usual.  Also, the fact that your uterous is contracting to enlarge itself to make room for the baby that puts the extra pressure on your bladder which can have you running back and fourth to the bathroom.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	most deffo|`|GEfpzUNvaa	oh you sure do pee more... and yes you can be more sleepy.. start taking prenatals if you believe you are and if your trying they don't hurt either. they prep your body for the soon to come changes.. good luck|`|Gw5j2hGOaa	Yes you definitely pee alot more, and you feel like you can sleep all the time.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Oh yes , sleep , pee , eat is all you want to do !|`|oiJITSNZaa	yes!
AA12395149	The dizziness if normal.  Your blood volume as increased and it makes it so you experience dizziness or light headed every so often.  Try to change positions slowly, don't go directly from lyind down to standing up, you may pass out.<br>  <br>  The seeing of lights often happens with being dizzy, but if you start having severe head aches or heart burn, you may need to talk to your doctor.  <br>  <br>  Swelling is normal throughout pregnancy, but if you have a sudden weight gain that is not related to eating a really big meal and your legs, arms and face suddenly look really swollen, you need to see your doctor.<br>  <br>  If it feels like your bones are separating in your feet, it is because they kinda are.  Your hips and abdomen aren't the only things that go through pregnancy spread.  The sad thing is, after the baby is born, your feet may still be a size or two bigger.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Unfortunately they are pretty normal  - sorry !  ;-)<br>  <br>  You can lighten up on the salts - that helps reduce swelling, and so does adding more raw veggies and fruits to your diet.   However too much also leads to the 'runs'.........<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to balance good nutrition when you're pregnant, especially if you have morning sickness the first part of it.<br>  <br>  I would say try making sure you get lots of rest, lots of water, and stay off the sodium, caffiene, and anything else unhealthy for a while....<br>  <br>  Fried foods tend to cause heartburn, indigestion, bloating and sometimes swelling in pregnancy too - I learned that the HARD way with my first son!!  ;-)|`|FLnEqAivaa	No, this is not good...sounds like Pre eclamsia...please talk to your doc about this. They can run some tests to make sure you are OK, and if you aren't, they can help you out.|`|DvuR7EjWaa	when i was pregnant, my feet got swollen. but i'd say you should still give your doc a call because of the dizzy part just to be sure|`|TtTMh4xKaa	im 33weeks pregnant and none of my shoes fit anymore..|`|EnCbkStYaa	hello..<br>  <br>  if you want read something about healthy,pregnancy question,or sign about pregnancy..<br>  i come just accross this blog : <a href="http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://questions--about-pregnancy.blogsp...</a> which may help you.|`|ZvPJjme9aa	you could have pre emclampsia call your midwife straight away it could be dangerous for you and your bay.<br>  good luck|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Give your doctor a call. Yes swelling and dizziness is normal but flashing lights is not. It is a sign of pre-eclampsia. They will have to test your Blood Pressure and check your urine for protein. I developed pre-eclampsia when I was around 36 weeks and had all the symptoms that you do. They ended up inducing my labor.
da498dbd39048a1057d2c4954514a889aa	March 22nd???? Normally if you were pregnant your breast would start to become sore about 6 weeks into your pregnancy. As far as the morning sickness that can pretty much start right away. Even thought your period is a week away you still may be able to get a early result pregnacy test to detrime if you are.|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	It is possible but unlikely. There is only a small percentage of women who have period like bleeding into their pregnancies. Your last period was still pretty recent. I would wait until your period is a month late before testing. Also, an oncoming period and early pregnancy feel very similar.  Best of luck!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	mine is due march 3rd...and I have the same thing..and Im trying to get pregnant before my hubby goes to iraq...just wait and see if your preg...|`|dTTbj7jzaa	buy a pregnant test to see if you are pregnant|`|eytlIKITaa	March 22nd?

I'm a bit confused.<br>  <br>   If you're period is due in about a week then you should be able to take an early detection pregnancy test and it would pick it up. Good luck!
wiAVa1H5aa	What I bet is that you are happier and so he is too, babies can totally tell mom's emotional state which effects them too and when you are content they are content.|`|xIlIbZJtaa	You could just be being anxious lol. <br>  But seriously, relax- your baby is perfectly fine right now. I know how awful anxiety can be and some of this medicine can be detrimental to you so do be cautious. Doctors say things are safe if it is safe for babys organs to process. But that doesnt totally rule out the possibility of very minor effects. Your baby probably just had a sleepy night anyway by coincidence, but your instinct is warning you that this is not a particularly healthy thing to do. Could you stop breastfeeding? <br>  More importantly, do you feel able to deal with anxiety in a more natural way? Anxiety reactions can be terrifying but there are ways to successfully combat it! Honestly, I know! I was anxious about the medicine prescribed to me once, for anxiety lol, so I got over it in natural ways. I tried to understand where the symptoms were coming from, why my body reacted to anxiety in the way it did. I started to eat regular protein which is proven to combat anxiety, and to just 'go' with the anxiety rather than trying to stop it (What You Resist Will Persist) and after doing this I have never ever had an 'anxiety' problem. I am still a worrier but I don't suffer from anxiety. Mine was so serious that I know anyone can do it if I did! Could you get some kind of cognitive therapy instead? Its so easy and cheap for GPs to prescribe this kind of medicine. Go back and tell him the medication is making you anxious about side affects etc and ask for cognitive therapy (behavioural) and you will be sorted for life! I wish you all the best and hope I could help.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	I would not trust any Drug that alters your mind to be safe for your baby. There are many techniques that can be used for anxiety without drugs.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Dr. Hale says that Lorazepam is safe for short term use.  But yes, it may make baby a bit sleepy.|`|VIHw7kRkaa	If your doctor said it was safe then you should be fine.  But I would still bring the baby to the doctors to just double check, or even see another doctor to get a second oponion.  Dont be freaked out because its not your fault.  I wish you both the best of luck!!|`|l7RJkc3baa	If doc said it's safe... it's safe! I think it's because ur baby is going tru growths spurt.. it happens, he is still a newborn-they sleep a lot... 18-20 hrs a day!|`|4WJM3j9Aaa	formula feed..|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Hun stop worrying! It was probably a coincidence :) especially if your doctor has said it's okay.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It probably depends on the dose, but he very well could be sedated from the medication. <br>  <br>  According to <a href="http://www.safefetus.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.safefetus.com,</a> Ativan (lorazepam) is "excreted into milk and potential to cause sedation, feeding difficulties and weight loss in nursing infants." <br>  <br>  I would rather ask a pharmacist this question than your doctor, because they usually know a lot more about medications and their side effects.
GEfpzUNvaa	i would try it.. just to get into tune with how your body reflects from not being on the pill or shot anymore.. try www.fertilityfriend.com.. its free for the first month then its cheap after that.. it has helped me out big time.. also go to walmart and get ovulations test strips and see when you ovulate that will help you even more to understand your cycle.. good luck and ***BABYDUST***|`|5deb28fe9fecaef7f55e1f593df11203aa	it worked for me....|`|3Ks21ASDaa	Calendars. no. even if you are always regular, you can ovulate and varied times each cycle. the ovulation predictor that you can buy is the best way to go. you pee on it and it tells you when you are ovulating. good luck!|`|0LwBdwAPaa	those are just estimates i would recommend using ovulation test from the store, for a more accurate result...good luck
Qydtjz2naa	I had a friend who struggled with her weight for years, she is still coping with it.  I remember she would only eat small candies, like tic tacs and mints for the whole day.  Ow while we were all eating she would just chew gum.  She would right the number of calories of everything she ate that day on her arm with sharpie, so she would look at everything she ate and stop eating [even though the calories usually added up to under 400 in the whole day].  I think she threw up a couple times, but not often.  <br>  <br>  I had another friend who was anorexic in third grade, I think that one is shocking, considering many girls used to play with barbies in third grade.  But young girls are being forced to grow up much faster these days, and it's scary. <br>  <br>  I don't have much expiernce with eating disorders, I don't know many people who have had them, or the ones that have had them don't share their stories.|`|Y2k81CWWaa	Well, I'm sick with a sore throat, achey body, stuffy nose, etc. so I'm staying home from school.

zgDQrI2uaa	Having seen too many women overly dependent upon men to provide an income and a roof over their heads, I can see why this mother would say such a thing.  If the daughter is young I can understand why the mother would attempt to devalue the role a boy would play in her daughter's life.  No sixteen year old girl needs a boy, (nor does a 16 year old boy need a girl), people at that age need to concentrate on having fun, growing up, and their education.  <br>  <br>  I have seen women who are too foolish to understand that the ability to earn your own way is a necessity in a day and age where divorce is prevalent and most families need a second income.  I have seen women who latch on to a man for his income, (son's girlfriend #2) only to be stupidly surprised when the man gets tired of forking money over for someone who contributes nothing.  I have seen women who are living below poverty level because they made some boy a priority over their own education and ability to earn a decent wage.<br>  <br>  As the mother of a 22 year old male, I would not want someone to take advantage of my son by being overly dependent (girlfriend #2) financially, but in a serious relationship I wouldn't want him to be referred to as an accessory either.  While I see a need for the mother's philosophy, trite sayings don't necessarily get the message across as well as living the philosophy.|`|AA12145826	I think she was trying to convey that they aren't what her focus should be on. My mom used to say "Men are like bracelets. They can compliment an outfit, but they aren't the most important thing you are wearing."<br>  <br>  If you look at what she said this way, maybe it will make more sense: Accessories are nice to have. But they aren't NEEDED. A car NEEDS an engine, it doesn't need heated seats. A girl NEEDS confidence and self-esteem, but she doesn't need a boy to achieve those things.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I hate that so many women say things like that. It really is an unnecessary put down. I hope she didn't have any sons who had to listen to that nonsense. A boy might not be a necessity but to call them an accessory? That's an awful attitude to instill in her child.|`|z788YHPLaa	I think it depends on how old the little girl is? Most young children dont always remember everything you say they tend to forget a lot! If she keeps saying this to her it may start to wear off on her and she may start to think that this is true? Its hard to say.|`|GBNzauGiaa	Mom is a man hater.  If she has a son she might change her attitude.|`|1SxFP1Chaa	Seems like she doesn't think highly of men. She is trying to tell her daughter to use men then dump them.|`|uIMtNJKQaa	mom was hurt by boy or is just a lesbo|`|AkFag8tNaa	Not a good attitude to have about anyone (people are people not things) but she probably meant it like you took it initially. I wish someone had told me in junior high/high school to think of them as friends and fellow human beings instead of something to pine over 24/7.
a2fd10af166e5b8b7d88fb2f32f097faaa	Hi <----->,<br>  <br>  I do not believe in the concept of "casual" sperm donation and no man is really tricked into fatherhood.  Everyone knows conception happens because sperm is half of the ingredients needed to create a new human being whether that's by intercourse or by artificial insemination.  Either way it is not a casual event.  Everyone knows the risks involved when their sperm is used for either such purposes.  One of those risks is multiple births.<br>  <br>  Next let's talk about children's rights.  Children deserve to grow up with knowledge of their natural families.  They deserve to form relationships with their relatives on both sides of their families.  (Limitations on that permitted of course if children are in physical danger.)  Children deserve all of their medical information from both sides of their families.  They deserve the support of BOTH of their parents.<br>  <br>  This case also shines light on what is fundamentally wrong with sperm donation in the first place.  It is an injustice to bring children into this world with the premeditated idea on the parent's part of permanently depriving the children of half of their heritage.  Sperm donation disrespects the child's right to his/her full identity.  It employs shady practices of non-disclosure, dishonesty, unacountability, coverups, etc.  It forces the child to permanently live an unauthentic life (whether known or unknown to him/her) in order to meet the desire of some other adult to be a parent.  One may recognize some of the associated rights issues and the accountability concerns as they both cross into some of the same violations territory that adult adoptees experience.<br>  <br>  No adults "need" to reproduce ASAP or otherwise.  That is a WANT, particularly for a woman struggling to support the 6 small children she already has!  Both parents should be held accountable to the future child(ren) they created.  One parent cannot excuse the other parent's obligations to their common child, contract or not, because financial support is something that belongs to the child and cannot be given away by another person, even a parent.  <br>  <br>  Every child deserves the support of BOTH parents.  Ethically, nobody can "casually" donate sperm & then walk away from their children forever.  DNA testing should be done to determine who the father is & hold him accountable for the financial support of his children.  I believe he should also be involved in their lives emotionally because children need their fathers too.  Not just in multiple birth cases, in all cases.  Thanks for asking our thoughts on this.<br>  <br>  julie j<br>  reunited adoptee|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If you donate sperm shouldn't you have to assume that something could happen, like pregnancy? t's kind of a duh situation. He should be responsible for his sperm. Maybe she lied but people lie all the time. He had free will and the ability to say no as we all do. Now the kids are here and someone has to take care of them. These people are mentally ill and I hope they get counseling again. <br>  The doctor needs to assume some responsibility too. It's ridiculous that any doctor would implant 8 embryos in a woman who already has 6 kids. This borders on malpractice. How did she pay for this?|`|1uCZFaR2aa	Nothing should "happen".  Who's to say she didn't have cancer?  How would YOU know?  And so what how she had kids.  If you don't agree, don't do it that way yourself.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	It is hard to say.  The whole thing is convoluted to the point where I don't know who to believe the whole way around.  It looks like not only does she have a screw loose, she only deals with people who have the same problem.<br>  I think anyone who knew how many children she already had and still chose to contribute aid in any way should be punished.  If anyone knew that her parents were destitute and that she was relying on them for housing and child care and still chose to help her have more children should be punished.  As it stands at this moment, she is broke.  She is broke, with 8 babies in the hospital.  Babies who are hooked up to a plethora of machines keeping their bodies running properly, because she was irresponsible enough to allow herself to be in a situation where she was pregnant with so many babies that it would be impossible for them to be born without life threatening issues.  Babies who will suck dollars out of tax payers pockets, when their own mother hasn't contributed money to that program in god knows how long.  It isn't the fault of the babies, but they are the ones who are going to suffer life long for the irresponsibility of these few people who planned this debacle.  Anyone involved who knew the situation should be sued for ethical misconduct.  Everyone who contributed to it.  The doctor.  The donor.  The mother.  There should be a fund in place with a 3rd party lawyer to dole out money where it is needed for the children.  Money that they mother cannot touch.<br>  <br>  I can say many harsh things about everyone involved, but surely by now they are starting to feel the weight of what they did.  It is only going to get worse.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	He owes it to the children he created to support them.  No excuses.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	If he wanted to donate and she lied - it's all on HER.|`|frpCK0utaa	i'm with Heather B. he needs to help support his kids.|`|38yPBwB1aa	I still think he should not be held financially responsible as this was something on her own. However she could have a legal case in that scenario, at-home donors have had that.
WirFwirLaa	Sure can. When we first brought our son home from the hospital it was the dead of winter and very gloomy out I also had horrible baby blues...So when my mother came over to help with my new baby she went around my house lighting all my candles (I have alot, I love them!) and let me tell you the smell of the candles and their pretty glow made me feel alot better!|`|byM2zxPAaa	candles are not a good idea if your lighting them in your babies closed up room (especially when sleeping). lit candles deplete the room of oxygen very fast.

cAtWxJG1aa	lol, how many kids do the people who think it's lazy parenting have? occasionally you need your arms for another child, and during that time you want the baby to be safe and active.  of course a baby gate is a good thing, and of course it's not lazy ... if you're using that time to help your toddler with the potty or your older child with their homework.  even with one child ... you do occasionally need to cook dinner or use the bathroom.  obviously as chickenfarmer said it would not be a good thing to leave a baby there by themselves for huge amounts of time.  but there's nothing positive about carrying a baby 24-7 or leaving him to crawl down the stairs as you're putting the dinner in the oven or fixing the sibling's boo-boo.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I used them but not how they were designed. I sectioned off parts of the house as well as parts of rooms.  They served there purpose well and now hold my composite pile.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well we have one and use it to block the heater off and took it apart and have used a part to block off another piece of furniture.<br>  <br>  So we have never actually used it as a play yard, my son hated being in it.<br>  <br>  Better to just baby proof a room and let the child roam freely around the room, that's what we have done.<br>  <br>  I think they are useless as what they are intended for, I wouldn't think any baby that can crawl would be happy in one being restricted like that, they aren't that big.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	lazy parenting sounds like an oxymoron. exhaustive parenting sounds more accurate most of the time. I suppose if you leave your little one in there for a few hours it might be considered neglectful, though. those playsets are great, especially when the child is just learning to crawl (not much good after they learn to crawl and climb though) and you need to fold laundry, make dinner, take a shower or some other task that requires the child be safe and reasonably entertained for 25 minutes. <br>  <br>  ps - it's even more fun when you buy 2 playsets and attach them - otherwise 1 playset really isn't giant at all.<br>  <br>  all the parents here need to stop putting themselves on guilt trips for not being their child's personal assistant.|`|AkFag8tNaa	If you were to constantly have your child in your arms, you would get nothing done. If you dumped your child in it for the entire day, of course that would be lazy and I'm sure there are parents that do that but overall, they are a good thing. If we hadn't had baby gates, my entire day would have been devoted to keeping my kids from climbing the stairs.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	It is good parenting keeping them safe and happy.period.at least the little buggar is getting excercise,good job.|`|irLnPW4aaa	I had one of these for my now 6 year old son.  We actually had the expansion set so we had the 8 sections instead of 6.  It was a great thing because he was very active, and without it, i'd never have gotten anything done (cooking dinner, laundry, etc).   It also allowed my older child (she is 6 years older than he is) to play with her toys like legos that had smaller parts without me needing to worry so much about him swallowing them.<br>  <br>  Using something like this only becomes lazy parenting if you leave the child in there ALL day long.   For a little while here and there, it is no problem.

6hA0O06xaa	Are you nursing her in the middle of the night?  My son used to wake up 2-3 times a night and want to nurse (before we ferberized at 8 months) and he'd wake up in the morning and not want to nurse for like 2 or 3 hours.  And this was before we introduced solid food for breakfast.  He just wasn't hungry because he ate so much in the middle of the night.<br>  <br>  My advice, as long as your daughter is nursing 6-8 times a day (if exclusively breastfeeding) she's probably eating enough.  And just make sure she's not dropping weight.  Also, I hope you consulted your pediatrician before taking away solid foods.  My son has chronic constipation (since we started solids) and it was never suggested to take him off solids...we were first advised to eliminate bananas and rice, then add prunes, peaches, pears....then try flax seed oil and prune juice in his oatmeal daily, plus more water in sippy cup...and after none of that worked and he had now been severely constipated for 2.5 months, we were told to try Miralax daily.  Works like a charm.  We've tried to wean him off it twice now, but he becomes constipated again.  Doc says he may need to be on it for quite a while and it is not harmful.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure at 8 months old that your daughter is getting enough of what she needs through just breasmilk.  And she may be not wanting to nurse because she prefers solid food.  Talk to you doctor and ask about the flax seed oil (some suggest Karo syrup) or miralax as an option instead of denying your daughter the food that the rest of the family gets to enjoy and the learning experience of eating off a spoon and with her hands.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	dont try to force her. if shes hungry she will nurse. try laying down next to her in a quiet room and nursing that way. maybe she just not hungry in the AM|`|bc07e210457d07686789bdd1b950122caa	I breast fed one and bottle fed the first. My first was a cleft palate child. She was on a cup at about 7 months. I was happy to throw the bottle out. The second was breast fed almost up to a year and we did intro solids from 3 months on.  She may want her independence from you. If she is hungry she will nurse.

Well maybe you need to only feed him one at a time. You know 1 per day. Then he,ll be ok and won,t be over fed. You have to give him time to grow a little before he can fit 2.

yr1hEsa0aa	First off in the UK things are alot different then they are in the USA so just because its 18 there doesn't mean anything for us. #2. I turned 18 while I was still in high school. Lets see go to high school, or stay home & drink. Or go out & drink at night & try to get my butt up at 6am. For get that I wouldn't have. If I look back at myself at 18. I wasn't as mature as I am now. & I was always told I was very mature for my age even at 13. Also at 16 & half-18 is when teens start to be able to drive. Driving plus being able to drink BAD IDEA. Its way to much freedom at one time.  <br>  & the fact they say "18 year olds do it in college." Ok well I know there is people shooting up heroin or blowing coke up their noes every day. Should we just make that legal too??? Why don't we sell that at the store & sell it to teens too!! & like you said 15 year olds drink...yea lets make that legal. <br>  I had to wait till I was 21 to drink. Its like a right of passage. When I was at the bar there was a few older people like 55-60. They are adults they don't want to sit there with a bunch of 18 year olds. & on top of it who are 18 year olds friends with? Kids that are 16-17. So now that gives 15-17 year olds a key to drink too.  This is all an all around bad idea.  I know 25+year olds that aren't mature enough to drink.<br>  I do believe that if you join the army/navy/air force etc & do one year active duty or have a card that says you went over seas to fight. You should be allowed to start drinking at 19. There is no reason why teens/young adults should be allowed to die for their country but not have at least 1 beer with their family when they get home.|`|Shp5riE6aa	No, because it would take more lives.  When you are older, you will not want a bunch of 15 year olds drinking and driving.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Even as a mother of 5 boys, my answer has to be yes, the drinking age should be 18.  My reasoning...it is unfair to allow 18 year old men and women to serve in the military, vote for new laws and the leaders of our country, and yet tell them that they aren't mature enough yet to make their own decisions about drinking.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	NO they should not... it's 21 because there i a certain maturity (most of the time) that comes with being older and more experienced in life. They tend to make better choices about drinking. Plus.. many 18 year olds are still JUST getting their licenses..so should we give them a licenses to drive and drink in the same year? I think that would be a disaster!|`|B7zL81whaa	It is 18 where I live and no 15 year olds shouldnt be legally allowed to drink. they cant even drive drive and they are like freshman in high school. A lot of them do illegally drink anyways but why let them go get crazy drunk in clubs and stuff where creepy old men will be lurking to get little girls that are barely teenagers.So no. that would be stupid.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	no|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Well, I live in Canada, and the legal drinking age where I am is 19, which I think is great. I think that any lower than that would be stupid. With the law the way it is, if drunk teens get caught on the streets, or end up in the hospital, parents will be notified and will be given the opportunity to intervene, hopefully teaching the child some responsibility. <br>  <br>  Kids and teens also have the "it won't happen to me" mentality.  I also think it would be horrible for the economy, because when 16, 17, 18 year olds start hitting the bars, people with an income, will stop hitting the bars. Really, what reasonable adult wants to party with a bunch of teenagers?<br>  <br>  Teens should continue drinking at home, in their parents basement, because lets face it, they're gonna do it somewhere, where their parents can deal with it. Leave the restaurants and bars to adults, where there are adult consequences when you abuse your privileges. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that adults can't be irresponsible, I just think that while kids live with their parents, they are their parents responsibility.|`|AA12384954	I don't have a problem with 18 year olds drinking.  Eventually people have to grow up and and take responsibility for their own actions.  There are idiots at any age - Binge drinking is a classic example.  In Australia there is a ZERO alcohol content for drivers on L or P plates, so obviously you are expected to mature enough by then to control your drinking.  You either drink or drive; not both or you lose your licence.  If you want to go out and drink to have a good time, then fine, only taxi it or have a non-drinker as a designated driver.  I never became a real drinker (drink only occasionally) because I was always driving, and never became an alcoholic like so many others.  I don't have any hang-ups with people that do drink, and many of my friends do, and many hold my opinion that it is fine as long as they don't drive.  The only problem here is enforcing the law in court to keep the ones that abuse the law off the road.  There needs to be tougher penalties, and most agree.  We all seem to know someone who has lost their life due to a drink driver.  If someone is 15 then they are supposedly to be under parental control, still children; so of course they shouldn't be encouraged to drink at that age - I thought everyone knew that alcohol could cause a higher risk of brain damage the younger the age of the person.  Going to be a lot of dead-heads around for the rest of society to look after if/when they grow older.<br>  <br>  Edit: Really surprised to see all the digits flying around here, must be a touchy subject - but it is hard to ascertain whether people are for drinking under/over/at 18.  Basically a person is treated as an adult at 18; voting, driving, serving their country, etc.,  so why shouldn't the responsibility of deciding whether to have a drink or not be such a problem, especially when they are supposed to be mentally and physically matured.  So some take longer to mature - well they are not supposed to be drinking and driving, d'oh, and they lose their driving licence as a consequence.|`|bAKbAKdzaa	absolutely not. they've done it before and look what happened then. 21-year-olds are usually a bit more mature than 18-year-olds. lowering it to 18 again would just be asking for trouble. then universities would be able to do nothing about their 18 and 19-year-olds getting drunk all the time. because it would be completely legal. <br>  <br>  too many reprecussions. just my opinion. and basic common knowledge.<br>  <br>  [xoxo]<br>  <br>  jessica mae|`|zYGJh5Odaa	i dont think they should because they would be way to young and it wouldnt be responsible and it would take alot more lives this way because 16 to 18 year olds are just starting to drive.|`|a2aafb60224488f9314dfd227d2cdb18aa	Absolutely not!  Infact, they should make alcohol illegal for all and legalize marijuana.  No more DUIs, no more drunken bar fights, etc.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	Well then they should put up the driving age to 18 as well. <br>  <br>  In South Africa we have 18 for drinking and driving. Hmmmmmm sounds wrong doesnt it|`|158e8f51e731e93ad7f2eb5b83dc2c28aa	Only if they raise the driving age to 21|`|0xiHNsmVaa	No, it's fine how it is.|`|XhzwLFieaa	I have to agree with Darcy. If we can send 18 yr old MEN and WOMEN to war and if they can vote and do most other things...why can't we allow them to drink? It's just rediculous. And really, most 18 yr olds probably drink anyway. I'm 20 and I did, still do. However I'm married and have a 7week old little boy.|`|TV47lmZ3aa	it's 18 over here in the UK and we're managing just fine, but i think that 15 is a little too low, even though pretty much all of the 15 year old's that i have met have had a drink of some sort or another, and most 95% of those have got absolutely plastered!|`|scui8nM4aa	well, I live in Spain this year, and before I came here, I didn't think there was anything wrong with it being set at 21.  But now that see how it works when the law says 18,  I don't see anything wrong with it.  I would say, yes, lower it!|`|JP8ttBmWaa	it should be 18, technically your an adult at 18 so you should be able to make your own choices at 18. why wait until 21, if legally you can move out and do almost everything else at 18?|`|SWOeg0jFaa	LOL I honestly think they should lower it to 16, but I think that they should raise the driving age to 18 or possibly even 21.|`|oyINZiNDaa	yea cos everybody done do it anyway...21 yr olds are buyin alcohol for minors anyway....|`|4HvuxHPoaa	No no no. Enough problems already. why add more.|`|uklVm81uaa	I think that if you are old enough to die for your country you are sure as hell old enough to have a beer.|`|xOVPJRgaaa	DEFFO|`|cj29AORfaa	yes. if I can go into the military at 18, I should be able to do everything else too.|`|AA11590582	It should be 18 years old the same as it is in the UK|`|CFy6v9H7aa	no shame on you
BUOJJpaCaa	Definitely! I didn't get my license until I was 18, though I did take driving school at 15.<br>  <br>  Wait until you are comfortable! It's really not that big of a deal.|`|7SCjPftKaa	In England, you have to be seventeen before you're allowed to drive. So if anyone asks, say you're learning to drive British-style ;]|`|DWl8nfyWaa	I learned at 16, but I know my friend didn't learn until he was almost 18.|`|oj1TszL2aa	Absolutely fine - learn when you feel comfortable with learning, and when it is convenient for you to learn. I'm from the UK where you can start learning to drive at 17. Many of my friends did this, I decided to wait as I couldn't afford it at the time. I started learning to drive when I was 19. My Mum has only just started learning to drive - at the age of 50! <br>  <br>  If people ask why you're not learning to drive yet, just tell them that you decided to wait - give a reason if you want, don't if you don't feel comfortable telling them. They should accept your choice. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|OZ3XmVDWaa	I guess it depends where you live :/ I grew up in a rural area and it was wierd if you didn't get your license @ 16 but 8i moved to the city bout a year a go and most of the people I've met (in there 20's) don't have one o.0|`|A03NJA26aa	I'm the same way.

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Is she formula or breastfed? When you say she hasn't 'drunk her milks for about a month," what does that mean? What is she eating instead?<br>  <br>  Green poop can be normal, especially once they're on solids. But if she is showing other intestinal signs, she could be developing a milk protein allergy. This would be from anything dairy in your breastmilk, if you're nursing, and is even in formula. Perhaps the milk is upsetting her stomach. And don't give her whole milk until she's a year old at least. <br>  <br>  If her symptoms get worse, or her stools become bloody or mucousy, she has a dairy allergy, no doubt. You can switch her to a dairy free (not lactose free, that doesn't make a difference because it still can have cow's milk proteins in it) and see how it goes, or if you're nursing, totally cut out dairy from your diet. <br>  <br>  Otherwise it sounds like she just might have a stomach bug.

More than likely, if your baby has green poop, it’s nothing to worry about, but here are a few possibilities.<br>  <br>  <br>  Iron-fortified formula - Some formula-fed babies will develop a case of green poop from the iron in the formula they are taking.

1SGl03Zlaa	We had a crib given to us that was about 25 years old.  It was still in great condition and passes safety standards.  An easy way to check and see if the bars are to far apart is to try to put a pop can between the bars, if it doesn't fit it is safe.  We didn't keep the mattress that had come with the crib even though it was wrapped in plastic, we figured it was safer just to buy a new one.|`|723QHuicaa	1)  If it didnt break the first time around, and after 30yrs is still intact, I doubt from your son napping in it that it would break.<br>  <br>  2) mattress - no. there is links to some of the foams used in mattresses to SIDS.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd certainly upgrade your own, and give the MIL your old stuff, that you KNOW to be safe.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I am usually all for thrift and hand-me-downs but in this case, I don't think so.<br>  <br>  The mattress definitely not.

I highly doubt a crib that old would be up to current standards.|`|P25GuvNjaa	I would have no problems using the crib if it was wooden and could be cleaned properly, you should have a look at it to make sure it meets your standards. I wouldnt be so keen if it was wicker or basket weave, I would worry about it being dirty.  The matress can NOT be used again, it will have to be replaced.  Using second hand or old mattresses are thought to be contributing factors to the causes of SIDS.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Use the crib, throw the mattress out and get a new one. No matter whether it was wrapped. You're not even supposed to use the same mattress for two of your own children - you get mould spores growing in the years in between.<br>  <br>  The safety rules have changed in the past 30 years - you are likely to find that the slats or bars are wider apart than in a new one. I'd use your discretion - if they're only a little bit wider than recommended and your baby has a great big head which couldn't possibly get stuck in them, that's obviously safer than if they are very wide and you have a tiny baby.<br>  <br>  But if you think your son is big enough to sleep in a bed at your house, why doesn't he just nap in/on a bed at your MIL's house? Maybe you could get a portable bed rail to use in both places.|`|deIzFnV8aa	A crib that old would have more space between bars than is recommended today. We are using an old crib (28 yrs old) and have had no problems yet - we kind of tried first so see if DD's head could fit or get caught between bars, and it doesn't fit, so not sure why the larger spaces are a problem (limbs getting caught?).  You can use mesh bumpers (ok from a SIDS standpoint) to make the bars a non-issue, really.<br>  <br>  Lead paint might be an issue if there is a lot of paint on the crib, vs just wood. Of course clean the crib with a damp rag or even soap and water.  And make sure it is sturdy, rattle it and make sure its not loose or broken anywhere.<br>  <br>  The matress should be firm and not musty or moldy - air out first at a mininum.  If its still firm I think it should be ok. If not, inexpensive mattresses can often be found on Craig's List, usually are one size fits all cribs.|`|y41bfvOCaa	The crib should be fine, just make sure it's not painted with lead paint. I would however invest in a new mattress as there have been many improvements made since then due to sudden infant death syndrome, plus there are probably millions of germs and bacteria harbouring there over the many years.|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	we used my husbands crib, it was his when he was a baby, if it plain wood it should be ok, i would not use it if it was painted, and i definately would buy a new mattress
cnIzqEoDaa	She needs to take a test, there is a possibility that she is pregnant.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Sounds like she could be pregnant specially because she didnt have a normal period. You best bet is to get her a test and see if she is pregnant or not if shes not she needs to go get checked and see whats going on.|`|3zg7oBA5aa	Buy her a pregnancy test and see for yourselves.  We can't answer more than, "yes that's a sign of pregnancy, get a test."|`|FQCLDT5faa	i am having the same problem right now and im only 17 its only been a week for me and i already threw up and i have a fever and stuff but im not sure if im pregnant it could just be the flew or something creepy though cause im having the same problem!!! she could be pregoo you got her egooo pregoo dude haha|`|4XfjUcvDaa	tell her to take a test|`|UsGF7haFaa	she prolly pregant that what it sounds like ur gonna be a daddy!!!|`|Ron6f6nAaa	buy a pregnancy test-and dont worry-jsut because the period is short doesnt mean that it indicates she's pregnant, maybe she threw up from eating too much, or maybe she just had the flu or she convinced her body she is pregnant and thinks she's experiencing syptoms that arent there, and that wouldnt show up until she was a few months a long anyways-so just take it easy and buy a pregnancy test if it will make you feel better--good luck|`|tXfMArb6aa	get a pregnancy test done you can get them at planned parenthood for free or just go to walmart or the pharmacy and if its been since january she reallt should get checked out it may not be pregnancy causing these issues it may be something more.---good luck|`|oIqdsBbIaa	the signs are when she hasent have her dot or cycle and she looks dole all most but she cranky too|`|AA11164125	she may be preg thats the same symptoms i had ask her to take a test to put ur mind at ease
wiAVa1H5aa	I was told by many pediatricians to keep newborns home away from church, the mall, large crowds in general until they get their first shots at 2 months.  Pertussis, which kills babies, is on the rise in many parts of the country and it doesn't take touching them to pass it on.   Seriously, at my own church the local pediatrician told a new mom to go home!|`|C4miEeuYaa	Not me. I waited till a day before she was 2 weeks to take her to a public place. (Besides the doctor of course.) I think the first week-the baby and the new mom need to rest and recover. The second week, I think baby and mom need to get a feel for the new routine of the house. I mean, thats what I did. But everybody is different I guess.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Personally Id not take a baby to church, or anywhere other than to the Drs if needed. Their still trying to develope an immunity system, and with everyone wanting to come look at the new baby etc, I dont think it was smart, but its her baby.I didnt take my kids anywhere with alot of stagnant air as in a church or crowded like the mall and when we did go out they were covered with blanket so they had their own air to themselves.(traveler draped with a blanket)|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	3 days old is pretty young. I would have waited a few weeks before I went. I know religion is important to a lot of people, but I dont think God would mind you taking a week or 2 off to look after the health of your child.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	I personally dunno if I would in that weather. But if she had it bundled/snuggled against her and She felt fine to go out. I dont see a problem really. I was at krogers 2 days after my c section. Walking around and going to the pharmacy there. Course it was 80 degrees out. No one came to close or rushed me.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I don't have a problem with it, and may I ask why you would put so much worry and thought into this?  A baby can go out in that kind of temp as long as they are bundled up.|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I'd have to say no for my own reasons, mainly because I am a germ freak pretty much, but I don't like really taking mine in public still and they are 1 and 3 now.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	oh, no,i wouldnt have. I would have waited at least a week.|`|l0ZuV1yaaa	Personally, I wouldn't, because I don't feel that energetic at 3 days postpartum.  I'm also prone to developing mastitis in the first two weeks (after 4 out of 5 babies), and so, I need to be taking it as easy as possible for the first few weeks.  I didn't feel up to going to church with my new baby until after 3 weeks this time around, and that's pretty normal for me.<br>  <br>  However, if the mom feels good and baby is fine, I don't see any reason she shouldn't come.  Personally, I have a big baby bunting thing to zip my baby into, that has a slot to buckle into the carseat.  With preheating the van, there really isn't any reason not to take the baby somewhere if it's cold out.|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	If the mother and baby were both healthy and happy, then yes. I don't see why they shouldn't be aloud to go to church if they want to. But if the church was into loud music I wouldn't go because that would be bad for the baby's hearing.<br>  <br>  By the way, I wouldn't post a question on here like that because whoever you're talking about might come online!|`|FLnEqAivaa	Oh come on..don't judge her. Mind your own business, and leave hers alone. Do you want people to judge you as a mother? I think probably not...and you know what is best for your kid right? Well, let her make her choices too...and if she felt it was OK to be at church with her baby, than that is her choice. Besides, we are not supposed go to church to judge others like that. So cut the new mom slack, and leave it alone.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Thats a tough question i personally wouldnt want to take a 3day or even 14 day baby out to a place, even church that can carry germs and people all around who might have colds, etc. I think she should have stayed home this week from church im sure god wouldnt have minded. Plus all the people who would come up to her and wanna see the baby, possibly spreading germs...Well at least you bit ur tongue, lol :-)|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I wasn't overly worried about taking my son out fairly early, although I was in no shape to do so:)  His first outing was probably his doctor's appt. at about a week old.  Taking him to church would probably have been safer than taking him into a doctor's office with all of the other sick people:)|`|3zg7oBA5aa	Personally, I don't think I would.<br>  <br>  Was the weather cold, or warm?  If the weather was warm.. then an hour in church to the car and back home doesn't really seem like too bad of a thing to do.<br>  <br>  But I see where you're coming from.  Especially if it is cold where you live.|`|eRyCzwMcaa	If she were nursing then the child is getting her antibodies and it is not that big a deal.  Besides, it isn't as if she were passing the baby around to strangers.  She was going to Church for an hour or so and then home.|`|6hA0O06xaa	You are supposed to avoid contact with large amounts of people until after they have had the first round of shots (2 months).  Our doc said "don't bring him to the mall on a Saturday" for instance.  I think a packed church on a Sunday is just as bad...|`|113FoyMFaa	Isn't it ironic?<br>  <br>  Being in church and judging someone?<br>  <br>  lol.  But to answer your question, no I wouldn't.  Nor would I bring a 13 month old to church.  IMO, if they're too young to form their own opinion, it's brainwashing.|`|VPJJdYCNaa	um im not a mom but y not? church is a good experience and it would be great for the 3 day old to have this experience and start out on the rite foot with God.|`|LcBYIRjhaa	im not a mom but if the baby is healthy sure i would take her to church. there's nothing wrong with that.|`|GfG6wupTaa	Aren't babies supposed to stay in untill after the christening???|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Me, personally, no.<br>  I wouldnt take myself to church, let alone my son.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Both of my children were born when it was warm out and we were out of the house the day after we were released from the hospital, no big deal to us, it was good for all of us to get out of the house. I do not think this new baby being out at church when it is cold is that big of a deal either. Most likely the baby was put in an infant seat carrier with a cover and blankets and was dressed warm enough, so the baby probably didn't even get cold or notice they were out in the cold. It wouldn't have shocked me at all. We used to attend church regularly until we had children, we attended until my first daughter was about 8 months old and couldn't sit still for 1.5 hours of church and go only for special occasions now as the members of our church to not take lightly to children's noise interrupting the service, we always get dirty looks and stares. Oh, well...I guess we will start going back when they can be quiet? Other families with children have also done this, I have noticed, as there are never any young children in the church service anymore.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Personally, if the mother felt healthy enough and the baby was healthy, then why not?  I personally wouldn't have taken my brand new baby anywhere where people could sneeze on her or touch her.  But I had a c-section and didn't get anywhere for 6 weeks.  Even still, if the woman hates to miss church, then don't judge her for being faithful.  Her faith is obviously a very important part of her life.  As far as the cold weather, cold weather doesn't cause colds, bacteria does.  They have those snuggly car seat cover things keep the baby so warm they're almost sweating, so I don't think that has to be an issue.  In fact, that baby was probably warmer than your 13 month old!|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	I don't think I would have taken our daughter out to a place like church when she was only 3 days old. First of all, my wife wasn't ready to get out herself just yet and on top of that I think the first few days are a good time to just get used to being at home and getting used to changing diapers and taking care of the baby as well as finding time to rest ourselves.  Also, while our doctor said it was OK to get out, she recommended that we make sure everyone has either washed their hands or used sanitizer (I don't really like it because it smells and is sticky) before touching her.  Also, it seems that everyone wants to touch her.<br>  <br>  Finally, why ask just "mommies?"  Do you think that fathers have no ideas or opinions about such things? I bet you think men don't even know how to change a diaper. It is amazing at how chauvinistic that some people are still.|`|zCWFy3Nvaa	I would hate to miss church also but I'd be more concerned about my child's health then making it to Sunday mass.My mother always said that church is important but you don't necessarily have to be there to praise the lord,especially if you have a 3 day old baby.Your suppose to wait until their immune system builds up(usually a month) before bringing out the little one.Even more so that there's so many people around with germs and bacteria. Wow and it was snowing?Bad choice.|`|OTiLeig8aa	I wouldn't have because it would be selfish to subject everyone else in the church to a crying baby!|`|Z8cBPUlkaa	u know... screaming kids... :D... church is not a place for that :D|`|ZnPwnIvSaa	no too young there is too much noise for their little ears i waited 2weeks|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Absolutely not. A newborn does not need to be dragged out in the cold and subjected to a bunch of stranger's germs. That just doesn't seem like a good choice imo. Three days out of the womb I personally think a baby should still be in a quiet, warm, calm environment getting to know it's mom. <br>  EDIT* I think it's humorous that so many people said they wouldn't take such a young baby out in public except of course to the doctor's office! Riiiiiight, the place with all the sick people. Ironic, no?|`|723QHuicaa	Em. i was in tesco the night we got let home from hospital, 5 days post section.<br>  <br>  Dont judge, her faith is obviously very important to her. If I were you, Id question my own content of character, and faith if I was to speak to someone in a church, silently judge them then go home and post a question about them attending church - of all places.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***** So why in the world did you attend church if your not religious ''in the slightest''?! There is a word for that - hypocrisy. Perhaps you should start attending church if you go around judging new mothers who dont like to miss church. And why did you take your 13m old daughter if the weather was that bad? doesnt that make you as bad???|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	I was out and about with my son from the minute we left the hospital (and I had a c-section). He was 3 days old out to lunch with my hubby and I. At 5 days old he went out to dinner with us and we even hopped the subway. By the time he was a few weeks old he'd been all over NYC with me. All they generally do when they are that little is sleep. <br>  <br>  My doc told me their immune systems are so strong when they're born. They come out of the womb ready to fight for life. I was never afraid that he was going to get 'sick', (even before I talked to the doctor) and thank God so far he hasn't. Healthy as a horse.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter was 5 days old when I took her to church. Nobody touched her, she was with me the entire time (slept most of the time, except I nursed her once) She was healthy and it went well. I don't see a problem with it as long as all precautions are taken.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If the baby was healthy, sure.  I wouldn't let anyone else touch her.  Fresh air isn't poison and although I'm not religious, I could see getting to attend church being a very important experience for a brand new mom.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i was back doing school runs after 3 days <br>  if mum is feeling  ok there is no reason not to <br>  being stuck in the house will  drive u crazy if u use to being out & about
mc6YtaRbaa	You state this is an internal position so I'm assuming you worked for this company and moved departments? If that is the case, he may already know, but you should tell him right away anyways. I would do it on the first day.|`|uLLQovSyaa	Is 21 weeks past the risk area for miscarriage (I don't remember)? I'd wait till you were past that before saying anything.Good Luck!|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I think hiding it will make it worse for you. You should be up front about it. Its illegal for them to punish you at work because you want to have a baby. Go for it. If they pull any crap, report them.<br>  <br>  Hope it all works out :)|`|npkLIKPUaa	You should tell them immediately waiting will defiantly make it worse.

QfitgXqSaa	all babies dont grow hair early..all this means that the babies hair will grow very long and healthy...give it more time and be patient.. maybe its jus a late bloomer lol|`|T0gv52CDaa	My mother always said I was born with a head full of hair, but it didn't grow as I did, so what was a head full on an infant looked really scarce on a two year old.  I was two before it started growing.  My 2 1/2 year old followed that pattern, and my 3 month old is showing signs that all the beautiful curls he was born with wont be around much longer either.|`|c73QkZ2haa	My oldest was bald till she was 1 and a half then her hair started to come in and it was white blonde. Both of our twins were born bald but are now starting to get hair at about 4 months..well i think technically i have to call it fuzz.|`|ocD3kv5oaa	I often wonder the same thing. I was born with a head full of jet black hair and so was her father, She will be two yrs old in May and only has a fine covering of blond curls on her head. She's bald! But i guess its normal.. idk|`|l0YvaYTDaa	My son is just over 5 mos. old and doesn't have much hair.  I know that as a baby I didn't have my first haircut until I was about 2!|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	My daughter is 14months and she doesnt have very much, I think its cute, she still looks like a baby!!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	My neice had none at all for nearly 2 years! Fair babies often take longer...bear with it...it will be all the better when it finally comes!|`|8t8NjjnVaa	Shaving or cutting hair does not make it grow faster.  It's a dead part of the body, so logic should tell people that cutting it will not do anything to the hair follicles to make the hair grow faster.<br>  <br>  My daughter had very little hair when she was born.  When she was 6 months, her hair was a little longer, but she still had very little of it.  <br>  <br>  Even at two years old, her hair was getting long, but she still had very little of it.  You could still see her scalp through her hair.<br>  <br>  Now she's 6, her hair is down past her butt, and it's goregous.  It's the kind of hair that people only dream about...the kind you see in hair commercials...shiny, healthy, beautiful.  <br>  <br>  So don't worry...I'm sure she's beautiful with very little hair, and soon she'll probably have amazing hair that will make you jealous (like my daughter)   :)|`|M5HyStReaa	I was bald until I was 2 1/2 and then got very fine blond hair.<br>  <br>  my baby's dad also has very fine hair so I expect a bald baby for some months if not years.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Just like you said, babies are all different.  My mom said I was bald until I was over a year old, then my hair just grew.  My kids had hair right from the start.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	My nephews were 3 years old before they got hair. Now they are 4 years old and still have very thin light blonde hair.
O3EtP4vOaa	Not everyone has a 28 day cycle, which you obviously do not.  So when your period starts 3-4 days "late" as you say, you are not actually late, that is the normal cycle for your body.  You ovulation day may not be on cd 14 or cd 18.  It is also not the norm for all women to have the 14 day rule of ovulation, most women do not.  You need to find out how long your 1st and second phases are in your cycle.  The first phase is  from the first day of your period until the day before ovulation.  The second phase (lutenal phase) is from when you ovulate until the day before your next cycle begins.<br>  <br>  You can find this out by using a Basel Body Temp Calendar.  I personally find it a pain in the butt to take my temp every morning, but if you just do it for 2 or 3 months you will get a very good understanding of how your cycly works.<br>  <br>  For instance....<br>  <br>  I have a 32 day cycle, but buy charting I found out that I do not ovulate until CD 20 and my lutenal phase is 12 days.  The first phase of your cycle can vary sometimes month to month, dur to stress or if your sick, ect...., but your personal Lutenal phase will always remain the same unless altered by fertility medication.  (Eg. So if you have a 13 day lutenal phase -you will know this after charting for a couple of months-  you will always have a 13 day lutenal cycle so you will always know that from when you ovulate your period will begin 13 days from that date.)<br>  <br>  Email me if you have more questions about it, as it is very complicated and hard to explain in one little message.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	It sounds like your cycle is 30 days not 28. that would explain the late start. if thats the case you prob ov on cd 14.|`|AA11661793	My cycle on average was 32 days like yours and i ovulate on cycle day 18. We would BD from cycle day 14 til about cd 20 usually everyday but if not then every other day. Good luck.. Lots of baby dust to you!|`|DRf4N4sTaa	if your going to see a gyne then i wud start charting asap, (if u dont already?) this is cos most gyne will ask u 2chart for 6mth and then go bk ! but if u go with 6mths of charts (or some charts) then he can look at them to see that u are/nt O, also O later defo makes ur period late, my periods use to b anywhere between 28days and 36days !! but which ever it was i knew when my period was coming(hoping it wasnt!) cos id charted and known if i O late, u can O later/early any mth, dont give up hope xx|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Hey,<br>  You have a 32 dday cycle pretty much it seems, so you would be quite possibly ovulating later than day 14.<br>  I am about day 16 and i have 30 day cycles!<br>  Try <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/tools/ovu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/tools/ovu/</a> its really useful. Put in your cycle as it last was and will give you your fertile window!<br>  Really useful - i think.<br>  But jst have lots of sex anyways and keep it fun and spontanious as we let ours get a bit regimented - not as fun!! So we changed that promptly!!<br>  Good luck hun xx

oiJITSNZaa	Don't get your hopes too high because then you'll have farther down to drop when things don't happen the way you want. I reccomend ovulating tests to even show if you even are ovulating. That is a common mistake many people make that just because they have a period doesn't mean that they are ovulating
00X4m7vjaa	the spot of blood could be a implantation bleeding, i would go to the doctor and get a blood test or wait a week or so until your HCG's are really high and take a another urine test, and i would recomend the digital test because the lines could be so faint nearly invisable, but i have ever skipped a period until i was pregnant.
yznZqcznaa	Is your tummy like that all the time or just most of the time?  The reason I ask is because I am showing too but not all the time.  So if I eat or get bloated I literally look like Im 5-6 months.  Its all really low too.  Yours is much higher then mine!  I will take a picture and post it as well.  It probably wont be till later though.  If you are like that all the time then you might be a little further or you could have more then one.|`|gCBqdHf2aa	I think everyone is different, and as long as your doctor doesn't say you are gaining to much than I wouldn't worry about it. You look like a small frame girl, so you might show more faster than someone who is big boned. I am 17wks 3d and am a little bigger boned than you and don't look as far along as you do. I am sure your fine.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I looked the same at 11 weeks, some show sooner and quicker than others! Congrats|`|OPTDFRuzaa	i was the same with my second and started showing at 7 weeks!|`|hA8XL17Uaa	Im the same babe!!  11 weeks and 2 days and look much bigger than i feel i should! I was told that maybe its just something to do with carrying alot more upfront than some people but lol same as you my man keeps telling me i am having twins and as he was right about me being pregnant when i kept saying i wasnt im scared he is going to be right about this too! I have got my first scan on Thursday and i dont know whether to be scared or excited!!<br>  <br>  xx|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Are u sure there is only one in there? That is pretty big for 10 weeks. Its a cute bump tho! <br>  I heard that diabeties durning pregnancy can cause you to be bigger also but they can not determine that later tho I beleive. Its been almost 2 years since I was prego so its hard to remember. Ask your doc about your size , im sure its nothing to worry about! maybe god just blessed you with 2 !|`|sqaey2Siaa	You are showing a little bit earlier and larger than normal. One sign of twins is appearing larger than you should!! Also, if you haven't been for your ultrasound to determine your due date you could be off by a good bit. Regardless, good luck and cute baby bump!!|`|aaea8aaa8ff942ba772575e135b0c3d1aa	I have to wonder if you only have one in there too???? Everyone is different.......... is this your first?  have you had an ultra sound?  we need a little more info to answer effectively.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!!!!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It does look like you're showing a bit early. Have you had an ultrasound to determine if you may be farther along then you think? I guess it could just be your body showing early. Congrats!|`|MDfleEXWaa	Hi, your showing too early for 10 weeks the bump looks like 4th month already i guess your having twins|`|CpiLHcTlaa	you do look a little bigger then normal. you sure your only 10 weeks? and are you sure there's only one?|`|GjuRYsITaa	mmmm are sure there's only one in there|`|Gw5j2hGOaa	I would think you might be having twins, but then again you may show for the next while and not grow much more for a bit after that. Is this your first baby? If not you show much quicker for the 2 and so on.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I was showing at 7 weeks and I looked like I was 3-4 months. It happens and no it doesnt necessarily mean theres two I only have one in there now am almost 4 months and my stomach is pretty big everyone thinks am more further along.|`|uuHPneEcaa	all girls start to show at differnet times. I didnt start to show until I was like 5 months and I still don't look very big. u could be having twins. who knows.<br>  <br>  u may be more than 10 weeks.
WnbutJsuaa	Hey, calm down, u basically didn't have a choice. Your father will understand and he'll love u anyway, so don't sweat about it, u should wait a few more days to tell him though, take the test again, make sure it's a big deal and then tell him, i know this is your friends account so lease tell the girl with the problem that everything is gonna work out and she can e-mail me if she wants to talk, i'm also 16 and have a friend who got pregnant last year.<br>  <br>  Pleease tell your friend to e-mail me and tell how everything turns out, i'll keep my fingers crossed for her|`|odEBpdEdaa	go get an abortion obamas president now!! WOOT!|`|Bz5aeBKpaa	the best thing to do is retake the test again to check if you are pregnant then if you are then you will have to tell your dad . the whole story. don't worry your dad should not be angry with you he will be angry with the boy as you only did it as you thought that if you wont that he would rape you.  once you have told your dad you may then have to go to the doctors to arrange what happens next. i hope this helps you with your problem|`|Y2k81CWWaa	I don' t think it was a mistake at all. If someone was pressuring me and would not get out of my house, I'd rather give in than risk getting raped and the damages that could be done like that.<br>  <br>  Normally, I'm against abortion, but because you didn't have sex willingly, I think it's a good idea. If you kept the baby, would you really want the father to be that jerk? And why go through the pregnancy, making you relive the experience.<br>  <br>  If there's a Planned Parenthood near you, then go there and they will evaluate you, see if you're really pregnant or not, and if you want, you could could sign up to get an abortion.<br>  <br>  If you had a boyfriend and decided to have sex with him, then got pregnant, abortion would be wrong. But this guy practically raped you, so abortion is best,<br>  <br>  If you want, you could go to the police and charge him for sexual harrassment. I would only tell your dad if your sure you're pregnant, and give him the full story so he won't assume you willingly had sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	you asked this twice. you can have the baby and keep it, have an abortion or have the baby and give it up for adoption. those are your choices. And call the cops on the boy.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I think under these circumstances your mother is likely the best person to talk to. <br>  <br>  If you took a got a positive test result, you shouldn't "think you're pregnant" because you ARE.<br>  <br>  No one on here has a right to judge you but I think you have some choices to make and your mother mother/one of your parents will be the best person to help you.|`|m5ViQJPeaa	No! No! Don't abort the child. Tell your parents, like the first answer said, go talk to your mom. She'll understand it. Just be brave and they'll guide you through.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	call the cops and charge him with rape, next go to an abortion clinic.......|`|TXmAx8jwaa	You say you THINK your pregnant, && then you say you ARE pregnant? which is correct?<br>  Anyway i don't think you can report him for rape or anything because you gave in, but what you could report him for is that you told him to leave your house and he didn't. plus he had sex with a 15 year old. <br>  Does your mum live with you? a sister you get a along with? either that or talk to a close friend but really you should just admit what you have done to your father although it will be hard its better to say it loud an clear than to bury your head in the sand.<br>  Good luck and i hope you tell somebody for your sake only. x
5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i didnt plan but when i was pregnant i looked it up and it said i was going to have a girl and i did ? could be a rare thing i unno . my cousins wife looked it up and it said it was going to be a girl and shes having a little girl|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	yes & yes! I know its just for fun, but it happened to be right
qNdsNhgOaa	Your friend is correct ;)  About an hour before your appointment, completely empty your bladder and then drink 32 oz of water.  It may get a bit uncomfortable to hold but it's something that all of us pregnant women go through and it's normal!  Once the technician is finished getting all of the measurements that he/she needs, you more than likely will be allowed to use the restroom and then they will resume the ultrasound.  Best wishes and congratulations!<br>  <br>  P.S.  About 20 minutes before you go in, if you don't have any issues with sugar or diabeties, drink a glass of juice or nibble on a piece of candy.  Usually the sugar gets the baby moving around a bit and it'll be easier to see the sex ;)|`|AA12395149	You should finish off close to a liter an hour before the appointment, then you cannot go to the bathroom until after the scan (it is horribly uncomfortable).  The full bladder helps to displace the uterus and baby so that is more easily scanned.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	they asked me to make sure my bladder was empty right before my first ultrasound you should be able to see the baby fine at 22 weeks with or without worrying about having a full bladder. also they can tell you at 20 weeks what you are having if the baby corporates =)|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	You do and..............they do expect a lot out of the mother's to be, don't they?<br>  <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	my ultrasound tech said i didnt have to drink a ton of water because the baby is surrounded by water. but you should just ring the ultrasound place and ask.good luck and congrats|`|98WKYtfwaa	For the 20week scan they do prefer you to have a full bladder because they're looking for abnormalities and with your bladder being empty it's harder for them to see everything. <br>  <br>  I had a half full bladder as i didn't think it mattered, i got in trouble when i went but after 15mins of scanning i had to empty it because they couldn't see his face properly. <br>  <br>  I would go in with a full bladder, then if they think it's too full or such you can empty it. It's easier to empty your bladder than to fill it up.<br>  <br>  Drink 4 tall glasses of water preferrably an hour before your appointment.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	an hour and a half before your ultrasound, drink 32 ounces of water and hold it. thats what you need to do before most ultrasounds. maybe it wont make a difference, but its a lot easier to pee and empty your bladder, then magically fill it up. good luck and congrats on your baby!|`|7rIAd6gGaa	At my 12 week I needed a full bladder, but at my 20 week they said it didn't matter. They acually let me go before and during the ultrasound (it was a long one, and I have to pee a lot!! lol). Good luck! I hope you can find out!!|`|gPg7qYGIaa	yes drink loads i kept being sick so mines was empty and it made it hard but don't get your hopes up to much as my baby had his legs crossed so i could not find out even it i had drunk loads
oXzHvsBpaa	We use the Dr Browns bottles. They are great for gas and coic. Our son had a terrible gas problem. We tried the Playtex Drop Ins and Avent before going to Dr Browns. Our doctor told us to get the Dr Browns. We love them and will not be using anything else even for the next baby. They also seem to help with his spit up.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I stuck with what my son liked, not with what I liked(Unless they were leaky).  He loves the Gerber brand sold at Walmart.  We've tried a handful of other ones and he wasn't happy with them at all...or they leaked.|`|UghJ0XROaa	<a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3247622&CAWELAID=255656008" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <br>  These use the same nipple as the playtex drop ins, if you think that is going to be an issue, but they don't need the drop ins and you would already have extra nipples to use from the drop ins.
AA12395149	It's usually pretty accurate (it can be off if you're obese because the excess flesh can skew the measure).  I've been measuring pretty much where I'm supposed to be.  Like your midwife said, if you're not 3cm under, you don't need to worry.  If it's 3cm under, then they do the scan to make sure the baby is developing ok or to determine if you might have intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).  You may just be a small girl that has small babies.  And yes, as long as your baby is strong and active, you have few things to worry about.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|AA12345219	My fundal heights have been all over the board! At 31 weeks I was 28cm, so they did a growth scan and he measured fine. Then at 33 weeks I measured 32cm. At 36 weeks I measured 31 cm so they did another growth scan and he was growing just fine. At 38 weeks I measured 32cm again. I think everyone carries differently and depending on how the baby is positioned it can be really out of whack!|`|IdoZbO39aa	My fundal height was 42cm at 38 weeks. I went off for a scan as they were thinking of inducing me if he was going to be massive. According to the scan he will be about 8 and half pounds if he is born on his due date. Obviously that is approximate!|`|0fygxRHLaa	hehe midwife|`|nVcR4cFJaa	At 33 + 4 i was measuring 32 and today at 36 + 4 i am measuring 35. I dont think fundal height meeasuring is the most accurate way of doing it. As long as your baby is active and strong then try not to worry. <br>  <br>  Good Luck xx|`|KPuDlWFiaa	when i was 22 weeks i was measuring 20 weeks, then at 26 weeks i measured bang on 26 weeks, and my most recent i was 28 weeks and measured 29 weeks, so i think it just depends babies have growth spurts at differents time, if your midwife isnt concerned then neither should you be|`|98WKYtfwaa	It's ok for the midwife to be a cm or 2 off, it's hard to measure your uterus because it's not exact so they basically are just giving you a good estimation, if it's 3cm under then you go for a growth scan to see how everything is in there.<br>  <br>  I was last measured when i was 16weeks and 4days, i was measuring 15cm so i was ok.<br>  <br>  I think most people are a cm or 2 out.

Jordan is also a great name and Marissa is lovely. The only two I'm not really fond of are Rivers and Leigha. Oh' and Alaina is such a pretty name, great pick! Best of luck.|`|2tVQm7Llaa	I like Alicia Renee (although get used to people saying it wrong) and Gracie Lynn. What about Alicia Grace? <br>  <br>  And I know the alternative spellings look cute now but when your child is 24 and trying to establish herself as an adult, she'll probably feel a bit silly with a name like "Kenedi" or "Chayce". Don't get me wrong, I like the name Kennedy - just not spelled like someone who's illiterate.|`|bUgoi42Qaa	I think you have too many thought going on. I think you need to write names down a piece of paper and say it out loud and see if it goes with the last name. You should look at people in your family. Example: My grandmothers name was Betty. I didn't like that because it sounded old. So I looked Betty up in a baby book and it was also a form of Isabelle. My husband grandmothers name was Rosalee. So we named our daughter Isabelle Rose and we call her Belle and Belly Button. lol. My middle name is Elizabeth and Isabelle is also a form of Isabelle. Just some advice on what I did. I like Hayley.|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	grace is a beautiful name, make sure u give her a good solid nam that she can grow into, no cutsey names. how about grace elizabeth, chloe?<br>  zoi?<br>  sarah is a beatiful name, my daughters name is sarah lousia anne. or<br>  maybe something from the bible, mary rebecca? josephine is nice too|`|MtDEf9zxaa	I love all the names!!

0nIwKd5Uaa	They have those flushable baby wipes, moist toilet paper things. For both adults and kids. I would suggest getting him some of those.  Maybe by the time preschool starts he will know how to wipe by himself.  My kids are a little bit older, and i still buy those for them to use at home.
2k2ZeUwkaa	Oh honey, im going through the exact same thing-came off the pill early dec, period 5 jan, and now im still waiting for it to arrive! some people are so lucky, when they come off the pill, their period is normal, others wait for as long as 6 months for things to become normal. I too have increased CM-its frustrating as you think your AF has arrived, but nothing! <br>  <br>  Good luck hun,baby dust to you!|`|d1csiCLKaa	Your cycle may take up to 6 months to return to normal after being on the pill. <br>  Try and listen to what your body is telling you and also count your cycle days.<br>  Sorry i can't really say when your af will turn up.<br>  I've just had my implant taken out 2 weeks ago and i've been getting strange tummy feeling etc .<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
etV271ARaa	Your symptoms are those of an expectant woman.  But if you tested negative, you could have miscarried. Just wait a few days and do the test again. But to answer your question, yes you can get pregnant after removing the IUD.
VS8mactUaa	it sounds very likely to me that you are, make sure no more tampons until you find out for sure. Brownish spotting is a common sign of pregnancy, definatly get a home pregnancy test, I spotted when my period was due and Im pregnant, so good Luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! it is sounding good! But if your infact having implantation bleeding I would wait a few days and then test b/c your b-HCG should 2x every 48 hours! But I am a POAS addict and would take about 19038209 tests! LOL! So take a test girl! KEEP ME POSTED! but don't be shocked if its a BFN b/c it may still be way to early as your levels need a chance to be detectable! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|txSiQc7Waa	Well you very well could be. Spotting happens a lot in pregnancy. Since you're technically "late" for you period, I would test. If you plan to test today... you need to hold your pee and don't drink a lot during a four hour period. This makes your urine concentrated :) Or wait and use first morning urine. If the test is negative, I would wait a week and see if your period shows. If not, test again. Good luck to you!
MW18liqTaa	I am not sure but I got nursing bras at target. I tried them on after I delivered. I was a D through my pregnancy and the D cup nursing bra at target fit fine. I had the thought, although I am not sure if it is right, that maybe they make the cup size a little bigger in nursing bras.<br>  It may just be best to wait until you are closer to delivery or after you deliver. Or, get different sizes and keep the reciept and see which ones you will want to return.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I would wait until after your milk comes in. I made the mistake of buying them beforehand with my first, and none of them fit and I couldn't return them either (Motherhood Maternity). You can get a comfortable sleep bra for now so you have something stretchy to wear once you leave the hospital, but otherwise I would wait. You never know how big they're going to get afterwards so there's really no way to tell. You could always order them online after the baby's born - they might have a fitting guide on the website where you get them from.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My breasts changed sizes so much in the first few weeks that I found it pointless to buy a nursing bra. I wore a regular, comfortable bra, and found it easier to nurse that way. I wear a tank top under my shirt and I can breastfeed without needing a blanket to cover up, or showing any skin.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	A good rule of thumb is to go up one cup size, but down one ribcage size. This is to accommodate for the milk coming in, but your ribcage will shrink down a bit after having baby.<br>  <br>  I would say though, that it is probably best to wait until a few weeks before you're due, or even just to wait until your milk has come in. There's no way of knowing how big you might get!<br>  <br>  A comfortable sleep bra, or a strappy top with built in support would be fine for the first few days. You are nursing so often anyway, that it may be easier and more comfortable at first.<br>  <br>  Ooh and in case you need some tips on good nursing bras, my favourite are the Emma Jane ones. They're so soft and comfy, and the clasps are amazingly easy to unhook and hook - even with one hand!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	As much as you'd like to prepare in advance, you should really wait a little bit longer before buying new bras.  In the coming weeks your boobs might go up a whole size, and then again when your milk comes in... or not, it is hard to say.<br>  <br>  I couldn't believe how big my boobs got... looking back at my pictures, I don't even know how I walked with them... haha!  Also, you will want to get a couple sizes... at least 2.  Because after your milk comes in and you figure things out and regulate your milk supply, then the size will reduce a little bit again...<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  I ordered mine online and they were great.  Bravado|`|urarletqaa	I was told to shop for nursing bras 2/3 weeks before i was due. The assistant will be able to advise you but generally your breasts will swell so you will need a bigger cup then you are now.|`|BaFFSwdvaa	The ladies at the store should be able to help you.  I don't think I was allowed to try on any nursing bras!  I had 2 types of nursing bras, cotton/cloth type (less expensive) and a sporty/elastic one.  <br>  <br>  The elastic one fit me way better and that bra accommodated a range, such as B/C cup size.  (I am normally a A/B).  I would highly recommend the elastic bra for better fitting and support! <br>  <br>  Yes, you will swell on the 3rd day or so, but I didn't find my bras to be too small at all. I'm sure your cup size has already increased since your pregnancy.|`|zATQaiwIaa	I would wait till the end of march to go shopping for these bras - or at least another 2-3 weeks.  I am due March 30th and bought my first nursing bra this past weekend, and made sure there was some extra room for a nursing pad and a little room for the breast to swell - not a lot but enough that i would be comfortable.  And I am so glad i went and tried them on and didnt buy them online - I tried on a Large sleeping bra thinking it would be plenty big enough - it fit perfect now - but you really do swell when your milk comes in and then on top of a pad in there it would have been to small - and they just happened to be out of XL.|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	go to a place called like motherhood. its a clothing store and they can measure you and tell you what size to get. good luck
7PXFXcKfaa	Triplets? Good luck with that!!! <br>  <br>  I wish i knew that breastfeeding is often painful and frustrating to begin with. I dont know if your planning to BF, but please dont let LLL fool you into thinking its wonderful and natural and easy ... (sorry i sound so negative!!!)<br>  <br>  It took me a good 2 weeks to get comfy with it, so please make yourself promise that you wont give up in the beginning if its hard (if your planning to BF!!!) Im STILL breastfeeding ... but i just am a bit angry now how the books and pamphlets make it look and sound so darn easy! grrr ... <br>  <br>  Also i wish someone had stressed to me just how much you bleed after childbirth ...(sorry)  what actually the books describe as "discharge" is more like the niagra falls. So be prepared. Like ... OVER prepared. <br>  <br>  Last one ... my mum did kind of prepare me... but i didnt believe her... and it might not effect you quite as much (im not sure about this sorry) as a VB person ... because its an early c-sec etc ... <br>  Anyways be prepared that on about the 3rd day after you give birth you WILL go into the toilet and just cry. And probably want to put them back in! Noone told me this was normal ... and at the time i felt horrible! Tears are another common bodily secretion after having a baby! <br>  <br>  LOL sorry for my insane ramblings though! Big kudos for you! 3 kids wow! Best best BEST of luck with your C-sec ... and the 3 little bundles of happiness!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Hm, interesting question.  Here's what I wish I knew.<br>  <br>  At some point I was lifted, naked from the waist down, onto a table by about 4 guys.  I could have skipped that, but I'm not sure it's possible.<br>  <br>  You can hear the doctors discussing your uterus as they sew you up and it's kind of annoying.<br>  <br>  Spinal blocks make your nose itch.<br>  <br>  If you get really anxious or upset they give you a shot of morphine after the baby is out.  Good in the short term, not so good in the long term.<br>  <br>  The first 24 hours of recovery are the worst.  But it gets better really fast after that.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	triplets! you're so lucky!! congratulations! :) <br>  <br>  i didn't have a c-section but here's some thing about parenthood/babies that i wish i'd known before i found out for myself:<br>  <br>  - it's okay to not breast feed your baby. i felt so much pressure to BF that i was in tears for the first 4 days of my sons life. He couldn't BF. I didn't like it all. I was too ashamed to admit that i wanted to formula feed that my son... my own fear of other peoples judgement hurt my baby. i wish i'd known that its okay to be in charge right from the beginning.<br>  - you have a choice as a mother to a newborn -- you can either stay and play, talk and interact with them, or you can do housework and run around being superwoman. I know which one i prefer. <br>  <br>  best of luck with your birth :)|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I wish that I knew they made you drink this awful solution to change the acidity of your stomach, before they do the Spinal.  Best to plug your nose when you are chuggin that back.<br>  I wish I knew that I would be starving, but unable to eat solids for almost 24 hours after.<br>  I wish I knew that I wouldn't be able to hold my baby long, for at least 8 hours after because I was so nauseous and shaky.<br>  Congrats...and good luck!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	With regards to babies, I wish I knew just how important it is to SLEEP and REST as much as you can before they arrive!! You'll miss it when your little ones are here.<br>  Good luck and congrats!
LKIhUMCgaa	this actually happens to a lot of women, some tests will come up positive, and some negative. sometimes ur hormones can be unstable and not show up on the urine test. u need to have a blood test done instead of urine one, so go back to ur doctor and ask for the blood test.|`|358Qy3Juaa	go to the doctors and demand a blood test my first preganancy result was faint and i wasnt sure went to the docs and they did a blood test i thinks its to estrogen count not sure but there is a hormone they count to tell if your pregnant if not demand to see a gynocologist to see why you have not had a period good luck either way!!|`|ADjrKpcdaa	You sound like me.  I had a period in Nov then nothing for Dec and Jan and did many HPT and all negative except for one which i did end of jan and forgot about it but when i went to clear my draws i found the test and it was positive!! but then did another two with first urine and negative so i have taken it as i am not pregnant.  I am also very confused as the doctor said if it's a neg after the positive then you may have been pg but lost it before it implanted and the HPT probably picked up the early levels of HCG.<br>  <br>  Also i don't know whether to count the Positive test as it was left for 2 days in my draw (I forgot)!  I hope this helps but every woman is different but i wouldn't completely rule out that you may still be pregnant because unless you are producing HCG you would not get a positive and a faint line is still postive!!  Take care xx|`|AEyztU2laa	You have most likely miscarried.  Not all miscarriages will result in bleeding, sometimes your body won't start to remove the embryo and other products of conception itself.  I would guess your doctor will want an ultrasound done to see if a D&C is required or give you another week or so for your body to start expelling the products of conception itself.|`|kH56qw2Taa	hi i missed my period by 3 weeks took about 8 tests and only the first 2 were positive. the rest wer negative i took these on every morning urine each day. then a week later i got a period. i still dont have a clue what happend? iam now 16 weeks pregnant and when i took my pregnancy tests they were positive and i kept taking more to make sure they kept getting darker and darker. i would say go to the doctors definatley coz i wish i knew what happend to me too. ive heard it could be an early miscarriage. good luck xx|`|wEwNDYPkaa	Well, sorry to say sweetie but, you may have lost your baby x|`|qCe9Pnlgaa	You need to see your doctor ASAP!!!!! Seriously.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	There is only YES or NO with pregnancy tests. How faint and how dark it is does not mean anything other than the concentration of the HCG hormone in your urine was slightly different. Once it says positive, it is positive. If you've taken different brand of Home Pregnancy tests, that can also differ in how much HCG level each test can detect. You have to also understand that even with the same box (some brands like First Response, they have 2 tests in one box), each of the stick has a slightly varied amount of DYE. So, the first stick may give you a good strong lines while stick #2 from the same box will give you a faint line.<br>  <br>  Because you've said that it has shown NEGATIVE at the very end, you may ask your doctor for a BLOOD TEST not a urine test to confirm the accuracy. A blood test is the only test known to be able to detect and pick up even the slightest amount of the embryonic hormones released during the first early stage of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I am now 37 weeks and 1 day (WOOHOOO I can't believe I've gotten this far, I've always had premature deliveries), I took a test initially.. 5 days before my missed period with First Response, I usually get a positive right away. However, with this pregnancy it actually said I was not pregnant. I waited 2 more days and it showed a faint line. Then, I took another brand and it actually told me I was NEGATIVE. So, I waited a couple more days until I was really late and took the First Response, DIGITAL. To stop me from wondering, is that a faint line or is it negative. I would imagine that would be a lot easier, PREGNANT or NOT PREGNANT in WORDS not the confusing lines that I could think too much about.<br>  <br>  <br>  On the down side of things, I hate to point out that maybe the HCG levels are dropping signaling a miscarriage. But, do ask for a blood test to confirm.
7at1Hyn8aa	A friend of mine is really great at making cheesecakes.  She sells them to restaurants and small cafes.  Since you are already in the food industry you already have some connections.  How about doing something like desserts, or catoring from your home?|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't but if you find something please let me know. I would love to do something from as well and it's really hard to find something that is real. Good luck and Congrats!|`|l0YvaYTDaa	You could do daycare?|`|8ec3c0b2a9a7fea3610c3a2b56080d4eaa	I babysat from my home. Also, you could look into being a sales rep for Avon or Pampered Chef. Best of luck!
stRWElvPaa	Hey! Just want to say I sympathise with the frustration. But you know, the odds were against you conceiving last month, just because the statistics say that on any given ovulation, there is only a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant. Also, there can be other factors with sperm, like whether your body sees his sperm as foreign bodies and attacks it, and have you been checked for PCOS? Are you sure you ovulate every month, have you tried ovulation predictors and tracking your temperature?<br>    If you search for your criteria on yahoo answers you may find other similar questions. good luck.x
AA12395149	The baby moves from two things.  One, the contraction actually moves it.  Two, the baby moves by itself because it's home is basically collapsing on it and it's trying to re-adjust.  The baby can squirm, roll, kick and jab during a contraction, the amount of space it can do it in is decreased though.|`|m9eSPvdfaa	Well how prego are you?  :)   Your baby will likely wiggle about when you experience contractions but baby activity alone doesn't mean it's labor. Bladder pressure from baby is normal as baby runs out of room to move.

s4OtfZ7Gaa	you checked it too soon the first time! yes you are pregnant... even if the line is faint, you have to have the hcg hormone in your urine to turn the line at all, it being faint just means you're very early in pregnancy|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	take another one and check after 3-5 mins, why woul du look after 10 secs and leave it for an hour? read the lable|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	You need to test again, how could you possibly know the result after ten seconds?|`|6VZGYCZcaa	If you read the directions on the box, somewhere on there it will probably tell you not to read the results after so many minutes.

KyFCYs0Yaa	Congratulations on her potty training so early! I know they make cotton training pants in 18 month sizes. I have some gerber ones, and a different brand that I think was bought at sears. They are just like underwear except they have a thicker, more absorbent middle. (it will NOT prevent leaks from accidents unless you have rubber pants over them.<br>  I also don't think it is uncommon for them to want to be naked. as long as she isn't running around peeing on the carpet, and furniture, I think it is fine.|`|xubIaiZaaa	i know it sounds funny, but when i worked in daycare i was with the 2yr old group which were potty training, some of the really little petite girls used to fit boy jocks really well as boys tend to have smaller waists and legs. So we used to put them in boy undies until they fit the little girl ones|`|1445874f3f5b71b7f8e98d2d0e1d329eaa	its normal, when i started teaching my son, he absolutely refused to wear anything, except bedtime. look online, u can find a lot of stuff like u r looking for on here|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Get the size 2T underwear.  You will be surprised that they fit.  My daughter is petite as well, and she potty trained at 18 months old.  She still only wears 12 month pants, but she wears 2t/3t underwear.  She actually can't even fit in to the smallest size pull up! So you will <br>  be fine.  If for some reason they are a little too big, just wash them and throw them through the dryer.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	What about terry towelling training pants or bigger sized baby bloomers (e.g. good brand this one - see p1 and p2 of essentials).  Might be worth checking out. And yes, well done.  Good luck.
VS8mactUaa	precum IS SPERM!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Sorry to burst your bubble but precum DOES HAVE SPERM...so in those "5 seconds" one of your little buddies could of swam away and found an egg to go to.

vygYFdsSaa	It does sound like an ulcer which you already mentioned. You should go to the doctor tomorrow. I wish I could tell you what it was but there are soo many possibilities. Hopefully its nothing serious and its easily remedied :)|`|S5GP2nlUaa	It's the shot<br>  it tricks your body into thinking your pregnant<br>  just relax
AA12395149	Both men and women can have fertility issues if they smoke and drink, especially if it's heavy.  For women, they can have as much as a 40% decrease in fertility from smoking alone.  The chances of conceiving increases quite a bit if she quits.  For men, the sperm are less motile and less likely to attach to the egg, a lab test found that 2/3 of the men who smoked had sperm that failed the attachment test.  Again, stopping smoking will improve how his sperm work.<br>  <br>  Producing milk will not lower your chances of conception.  Many women accidentally get pregnant while they are breast feeding.  <br>  <br>  If you were smoking during your last pregnancy, that may be one of the reasons you lost the baby at 27 weeks.  Smoking during pregnancy increases risk of still birth, preterm labor, IUGR, and pregnancy induced hypertension.  If you are smoking now, I recommend you try to quit for at least a few months before trying to conceive again.  You should use pregnancy as a time to improve your health.<br>  <br>  Sorry about your loss|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Both will definitely affect you, and smoking reduces a mans sperm count. I'm not sure about alcohol for him though.<br>  <br>  If you want to conceive again, you need your body to be as healthy as possible first, meaning no smoking or drinking and eat properly. Take folic acid or even prenatal vitamins while trying to conceive.
C4miEeuYaa	LOL-mine is 7 months and just started doing that too. I thought she was the only one! It's normal. But if he is grabbing at his ears, he might have an infection. But if not, and he seems in good spirit, it's normal! :)|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	Yes my daughter used to do this, she was slightly older than your son, but if you laughed she would do it faster and laugh. It used to make me feel sick and I did all I could to encourage her to stop, but she just one day didnt do it anymore!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son does this.  I think he just likes the way it feels.|`|djFYf3qUaa	He might be doing it, just to be doing it. Like shaking his head ''no.'' If he's seen other people around him doing it often, or if he's bad or something and you shake you're head ''no'' at him, he'll remember that. That could be one possibility.|`|urarletqaa	My child did that its normal. He did it mostly when he was in his cot before he fell asleep. I found it really cute :)|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes, my boys did that too, its a phase, no shaking comes before yes, and when talking starts no again is said before yes.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	He could be exploring his range of motion. Or he could have something bothering him. You should mention it at his next check up but he has likely just discovered another interesting thing he is capable of doing :)|`|tLGbtmGsaa	yes very normal.  I was so worried to when my twins started to do that. He probably finds it fun to do.  If you think it looks strange or not normal get medical advice to be on safe side.  I think he will be ok.  Take care :)|`|TO3Ojjr0aa	I'd get his ears checked for fluid.

(:|`|EXYYMLYraa	Liesl & Juliet are beautiful. Elsie sounds like "L.C." so is potentially annoying for her. "Ellie" is too common & sounds like "L.E."|`|no4tGa45aa	Ellie is my favorite from your list - although im a little biased my daughter is Elody and one of her many nicknames is Ellie :P|`|Iw4Ed5Ueaa	10-good      0- bad<br>  <br>  Ellie- 8<br>  Elsie- 10<br>  Liesl- 5<br>  Juliet- 9|`|g27LbLQsaa	I like Ellie and Juliet best. <br>  <br>  Liesl reminds me of the sound of music and Elsie is a little old fashion for my taste. <br>  <br>  What about Ella?|`|NZnNak9Caa	i love ellie if i was having a girl we were going to name her ellie grace its so pretty|`|mAHJ5bhTaa	Juliet<br>  Elsie<br>  I really like them .

RPszYGXkaa	Usually implantation takes place 6-12 days after the O, but can occur later than that.  Usually you can get a positive HPT within 4 days of implantation.  Baby dust!|`|GEfpzUNvaa	SORRY I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCE THAT OR HEARD OF THAT.. GOOD LUCK THOUGH
txSiQc7Waa	Ok I think there's a big misconception about htp and what day they "should" work. Just because the box tells you that it could detect it some many days before your period, doesn't mean your eggie has cooperated and implanted on the precise, perfect day. If your egg implants late which I'm sort of assuming could have happend on day 13, then your levels probably weren't high enough to test yet on 15 dpo. So my advice is to wait a few more days. If your period shows then you know you're not preg. But if it doesn't, then test again. :) I wish you lots of luck and Baby Dust!|`|XyRzSzjtaa	im in the same boat and im so peed off, my period ended on 10.2.9 so i had sex on 10 11 13 14 15 16 18 20 22 and last nite i had sex when the come came back out i had blood there and today 23 i had some brown discharge and i dont know wot it is and im scared to do a hpt incase i get a bfn, i know how you feel<br>  <br>  good luk and baby dust to you
vewacy5Saa	I would tell you to just be friendly toward her! shes probably going to be a little shy at first not seeing her dad in a year. But maybe do something she likes to do to relax her.. thats really all i know|`|PK498w0Saa	A picnic, go watch a movie, go bowling, swimming, get a pizza that sort of thing. You need to do something fun all together which everyone will enjoy so it's more relaxed. Also, try not to act nervous and don't bug her all the time to make sure she's ok, like asking her if she wants a drink every five minutes because she'll sense you're tense and think it's her fault. Just do something fun and enjoy it yourself as well.AND AVOID ASKING DULL QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOOL! Kids hate it when adults talk to them about school!|`|qlgvecs9aa	how about going to chuck e cheese ??<br>  or to the movie??|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Josh is clearly on his period, ignore him.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself! Be fun loving, take her out to some places, like for dinner, spend some time with her like drawing and such..<br>  <br>  Don't let her 'walk all over you', but be somewhat lenient, but strict enough. And ask her about herself, like her interests, what she likes etc. Maybe get to know her more?<br>  <br>  Basically, be friendly. :)|`|RKTNDLDKaa	At 9, she probably has some strong opinions.   I am doubting that she's going to be real receptive to you or your husband since she's never met you and hasn't seen her dad in over a year. <br>  <br>  I would just introduce yourself.    Don't try to hug her or be affectionate (she doesn't know you and won't be comfortable with you and you shouldn't try too hard).    Your husband should just play it by ear.     He should just tell her that he's missed her and loves her.  <br>  <br>  Maybe go out to eat (let her pick the place).    Ask her what she wants to do for the afternoon (seeing a movie would be a good idea since that will require very little interaction).    I am saying that  little interaction would be good because it will be uncomfortable for your step-daughter.   <br>  <br>  Just ask about school, what they're studying.   Is she involved in sports?   When is the next game?    <br>  <br>  Just don't try too hard.  Don't force yourself on her.   Just hang back and let her and dad get to know each other again.       Don't say anything negative about her mom--that's the fastest way to permanently damage any hope of a relationship.|`|AA12279950	Depends where you are but if the weather's nice, what about a theme park visit - Paultons Park (south of England) is good for that age group.  <br>  <br>  Alternatively bowling is a nice family activity, which involves you talking to each other but not in a serious way!  I have a new foster daughter and we took her bowling yesterday - it was a lovely relaxed afternoon for the whole family and we all got to know each other a little better.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you x|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	I would just introduce yourself and then leave her to spend time with her dad alone. You don't need to be there, and if she hasn't seen her dad for a year then she needs to renew the bond with him before having to deal with you.<br>  <br>  That is if you actually care about her.|`|009b0bbe5bd2538efdd1143c1bc82b19aa	crikey, i think Josh needs to calm down.<br>  <br>  Never an easy one to predict, depends how the child reacts to a) the father and b) you.<br>  <br>  I'd try and be yourself and be prepared to take a back seat in the day.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	i find it hard that the court would force you to be there especially if she hasnt seen her dad in over a year. its going to be tough on her as it is and the transition should be gradual but if thats what the courts decided i guess you have no choice right.<br>  I would be there, but just hang back and let her come to you. You can start small talk with her if you like, but dont force anything on her. Plan a day with her to the mall or chucky cheese, something that is fun for her and gives her a chance to re bond with her dad, but also have fun with you aswell. Give her space if she is pulling back and just take things slow. Try not to act as nervous as you are since she will be able to sence this from you...|`|a9btWYKRaa	Find out what she likes to do, let her choose where to go etc.  Don't pretend to be something you are not and don't try and act like her parent, its way too early for that.  Show her that you are serious about getting to know her and your not set out to separate her from her dad or interfere.<br>  <br>  Do show her that both you and her dad have boundaries too so she don't be able to get away with everything or she will just think your a pushover and have no respect for you.<br>  <br>  Let her know that she can trust you and rely on you. Make her see that when she needs you, you will be there no matter what it is.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck, Just relax and enjoy your time with her.|`|n2ARZd4oaa	First off you are not her Mom. Think of this as a posative. If you become open and honest with her she will do the same. You could be the one to turn too with "the girl questions." Perfect to be her best advocate. <br>  Think back to when you were 9. What did you enjoy? Maybe something like dinner should not be the first step. Sitting face to face gives pressure to come up with mindless chit chat. Movies, zoo, window shopping. Go to the store and buy a craft to make for dad. Buy a game and start family game night or family movie night. These are good ideas because they build structure. Children from infancy love and thrive on structure. Good for kids to know that no matter what Saturday between 6 and 8 is MY time with MY family.Most important dont buy her respect and love earn it. You would want the same.|`|ISbtuWdTaa	Since it's the first time you've ever met her, don't be bossy of her, let her Dad do that.  Be a friend to her, ask her what her interests are and try to maybe do some of those things with her.<br>  <br>  Make sure she does know that you aren't there to replace her mom, but you will be there for her if she needs to.|`|wKCgaoZVaa	Just be friendly with her. Give her space with her Dad, so she won't think that you've taken him away.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and good luck =)|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Send her back to her real Mom's; if  your husband hasn't seen her in over a year, why now???|`|1enIWBGnaa	Don't do anything.  Just be yourself and allow her to come to you.|`|So7lXdBKaa	take her to the cinema and then mc donalds

If you're trying to get pregnant and you're getting stressed out about it, this could explain the delay in your period, although you could be pregnant.<br>  <br>  I would suggest waiting it out and keep taking those hpt. If it's been a month or so and you're still getting negative hpt and no period, to hit up the doctor for a blood test (or go sooner if you'd prefer).|`|bvLvOqIzaa	Hi, I am the official gyno for Yahoo Answers.

wcDStct2aa	My daughter is 11 months old and when she had her 9 month check she was having 2 8oz bottles and 3 meals a day. I was worried but the health visitor said that we don't know how much milk is in the food that they eat there is 4oz of milk in one children's yogurt. i wouldn't worry so much if you feel that your child is healthy and the health visitor shows no concern don't worry. If you are worried encourage your child to eat chunks of cheese or a yogurt at every meal my daughter loves yoghurt's. I wouldn't put of cows milk they only say 12 months as a child's digestive system is developing just cause someone may feel that your child is underweight doesn't mean you should hold of the change, cows milk will help with the weight as it has more fat, i generally don't feel that weight should be a problem in any child unless there is a obvious problem as every child is different.|`|no4tGa45aa	My daughter is 10 and a half mths - she weights nearly 9kgs (so 8kgs is fine) my LO has just started to give up milk (her choice, not mine) so her day is usually -<br>  Breakfast - 140mls formula, porridge<br>  Morning tea - fruit (dried or fresh)<br>  Lunch - left over table foods from the previous night (usually meat and vegge) if we dont have left overs then i cook some vegges - in strips so she can self feed<br>  Afternoon tea - fruit again, rice cakes<br>  Dinner - Meat and Vegge<br>  <br>  If hes putting on weight and seems full then he is probably just fine :)<br>  <br>  (Also my LO doesnt have any teeth yet and eats table food like a champ! She doesnt choke on ANYTHING!!)|`|oWdNHaRGaa	Hey,<br>  my your son weight is fine, he should be having 4-5 bottles a day and solids when he is hungry|`|E5CnUdhsaa	he should be having around three meals a day breakfast lunch and dinner, 3 8 oz bottles of formula. and some snacks if he wants, he can have table foods also the weight is fine as long as hes not losing any dramatically:)|`|6YwjNHJLaa	ABOUT 3 OR 4 BOTTLES A DAY WITH SOME TABLE FOOD BUT ONLY IF HE HAS TEETH....HE IS A LITTLE UNDERWEIGHT BUT EVEY BABY IS DIFFERENT..

Ka52nbhNaa	You just asked a question about IVF and stated that you would need to do IVF to conceive . . . <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApvzaCRUzm5x7EFd.nE.3rF_7hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090223055954AAALVSP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  IVF is very stressful and the medications are hard on the body with loads of side effects from mood swings to headaches, tenderness at the injection site (daily injections of fertility meds) and bloating that could impact the way your wedding dress would fit . . . <br>  <br>  If you are talking about trying naturally and hoping for the best, then go for it before the wedding if that is what you want but I highly recommend waiting until after the wedding if you are talking about doing an IVF cycle.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|ksoMldqYaa	I would wait and start on your wedding night, it sounds cheesy but there is something so romantic about that.  Plus, you don't want to spend your honeymoon with morning sickness.|`|XyRzSzjtaa	unless ur very fertile the average is 6 to 12 months for woman trying to have a baby.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|rDPADat1aa	If it were me, I would wait until after the wedding is over to start TTCing.  Both a wedding and TTC are very stressful.  It's best to TTC when the stress is over, giving you a better chance at conception.  <br>  <br>  Right now, to prepare, you can start taking prenatal vitamins and exercising regularly.  Also adjust your diet so that you're eating as healthfully as possible.  This will prepare your body for pregnancy and make it easier to shed the baby pounds afterward.  Also, you can start charting your BBT and mucus signs (check out <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/</a> ) so that when the time comes to start trying, you know your cycle as well as you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Nux5S6oVaa	I would wait. My husband and I were together 8 years before we got married and now have been married 3 years. We are expecting our first child in Sept.  I cannot tell you the number of people I know that rushed into having a child...some before and some after getting marriage.  Marriage isn't the same as just being with someone, I'm so grateful we waited, we were able to do some many things and enjoy each. We've grown so much that were are as ready as we will be.  And those people? They aren't together or if they are, they are miserable. <br>  <br>  No one can make this decision for you, but once you make it...it's made. Right?<br>  <br>  Enjoy you're wedding and honeymoon- Especially if you are going somewhere all inclusive for a honeymoon! We went to Sandals in Jamaica and the food, drinks and activities...wouldn't of been the same if I were pregnant, especially as sick as I've been.  I'm extremely tired, nauseous, and moody...just FYI if you do try! The wedding might feel more like work eh?|`|KOwzDLPdaa	No one one here can decide if it is too early, thats up to you and your soon-to-be-spouse.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are the woman, take prenatal vitamins while trying to conceive. Its good for your body and will help prep you for pregnancy. Find out when you are likely to be ovulating and have unprotected sex as often as possible from about 10 days after your period starts. Good luck!
g9vw4ovGaa	Ok honey first of all relax a little, it'll never happen unless you relax! I was told at the age of 16 I would never have children but the night I married my hubby, I was pregnant, just relax and have fun! My mom tried for 7 years, and the night she gave up, she said no more, i'm done, she was pregnant that week. Just relax and make good sweet love to you hubby, and stop thinking about it as only to make a baby, make the love, thats what makes the babies!
GEfpzUNvaa	i use fertility friend also.. my temps are allover the board no consitency in them at all.. i use opk test also.. and those seem to be more accurate cause its coming from your body... so i would say that you did ovulate tuesday or wedn.. those strips see the surge of the hormone for ovulation.. so just as long as you babydanced.. you should be good.. you should always baby dance from the time you see one positive test for about 5 days after.. im on the same track this week though.. and yes those are most likely ovulation pains that you had.. good luck and **babydust**|`|jaP0TANdaa	Sound pretty accurate to me! Ovulation can happen anywhere from 12 to 48 hours after a positive OPK... so that'd be right about Wednesday. And, your temp generally rises (and stays elevated) the day after ovulation. So, it does sound like Wednesday was your ovulation day! Some women will experience ovulation cramping as the egg is getting ready to be released, while others experience the cramping when the egg is actually released, and some don't feel anything at all. I'd definitely say your ovulation date was most likely Wednesday. Good luck, hopefully you timed your baby dancing well this month and can get your BFP!|`|oiJITSNZaa	yes definitely on tues or wed

I don't know how common it is, but with my first pregnancy I didn't have morning sickness, however I had terrible sickness with my second pregnancy and I'm always comparing how much better I got it the first time around because I was able to eat and drink as I please without being worried that it will eventually come all out.|`|AA11637393	I've had 3 babies and didn't have morning sickness.

AA11637393	I think everything is fine.  The pain is probably due to the baby dropping down.  At 36 weeks you probably have a long way to go.  This last month is very hard.  It is tiring and physically exhausing.  Its hard to walk. etc.  However, anything you have questions just call your doctor|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I'm on pregnancy #3.

laVH1Bz3aa	unix is trying to scare you. abortion will not make you infertile.<br>  <br>  however, you need to decide what you want to do. first of all, tell someone you can trust - an adult. if you aren't ready to talk to your uncle one-on-one yet, tell a teacher, other relative, or parent of a friend, and then have this person help you talk to your uncle.<br>  <br>  next, go to the doctor. you need the confirmation and to keep yourself healthy. you absolutely need to see a doctor regardless of whether you continue with the pregnancy or not.<br>  <br>  in the future, use birth control, self-restraint, and good judgement to avoid this predicament. good luck!|`|HgVLhCr9aa	You're in a tough situation.<br>  <br>  Consider giving the baby up for adoption.  You're pretty young and it doesn't look like you have a support system in place.  If you did find out who the father was (via a paternity test), his family might be able to help.  At the end of the day you're not completely alone in this.<br>  <br>  I'd advise against killing your child outright though (I know this is kind of a crazy thing to say, but it's the day and age we live in).  It may strike you as pragmatic and convenient, but you'd be killing your own baby.<br>  <br>  Go to your uncle and tell him.  He's your father figure at this time in your life, I bet.  One of the reasons young girls have promiscuous sex is because they lack a strong father figure; they want to feel loved.  Try strengthening your relationship with your uncle by spending more time with him by playing games or doing outside activities (hikes or the like).|`|c5a50631f90f4ba04d88c923dc2aa963aa	tell him anyway and keep the baby... abortion will haunt u or even make u infertile in later years...God bless<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: abortion is known to cause scar tissues in the uterus... and God only knows what happens to a young developing womb if it is violated in such a manner... i looked after people with infertility problems... many of them had an abortion in their history, and their wombs were hostile to embryos!... put 2 and 2 together!|`|zdMlBTATaa	*cough*<br>  Who*e<br>  *cough*|`|N9pKl35Xaa	..14.. sad sad sad|`|YyX0EJDRaa	Gee!|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Your 14 and having sex with more than one guy? Wow! Well I understand that you don't wanna tell your uncle, so go to a planned parenthood place. You can get an abortion pill if you wany=t without your uncle finding out. But if you are having the baby, then he's gonna find out. Get a DNA test to see who the daddy is and then tell him right away!

It is killing a child. I don't care if you think otherwise, you can call it whatever you want. It's still murder, and it's wrong. <br>  <br>  If you don't want the child, because of your uncle, try to find a good couple that couldn't have kids or something and let them adopt your baby when it comes. But, I think you should tell your uncle. He might be more understanding then you think. And he would be able to tell after a while, wouldn't he? A big belly is pretty obvious. :P <br>  <br>  Just don't abort it. Please. I'm begging you. Do not abort this child. You will only regret it later.|`|iPGxXRHgaa	Well you are very young. You are a child expecting a child. But, what is done is done. I was pregnant at 17 so i can't judge you. All i can say is decide what YOU want, do you want this baby?

Good luck to you|`|BRnYseFKaa	well it depends if you plan on keeping it or not.<br>  if you keep it....well the obvious answer is that you would HAVE to tell him or else he'll find out on his own through time anyway<br>  <br>  if you dont keep it, then you get an abortion. try get friends, trusted adults, etc to chip in the money if you dont have it and you pay them back.|`|15it6Zyqaa	get a boy friend ASAP|`|UVK1DxW3aa	just keep humpin b**** thats what you get!!!<br>  <br>  jst kidding..|`|bMaa3bk2aa	wow, my sister isn't alone.<br>  she did the SAME thing, except she knew who the father was.<br>  her luck isn't that great, but....<br>  for you, my advice [from experience]<br>  is to FIRST find out who teh father is, take both of them to the doctors, and make sure. <br>  now for the baby, first tell your uncle. he'll help you make up your mind with what to do with your baby.<br>  three options-<br>  abortion<br>  adoption<br>  and keeping it<br>  you choose. <br>  best of luck, lots of love, and a prayer.|`|VIHw7kRkaa	That is terrible!!

Not only do you need to go see a doctor to figure out what your going to do with it, you need to go see a counselor because you obviously have some mental issues for letting 2 different guys do that to you at 14 years old!

rNvXWMOMaa	no, being pregnant doesn't mean you can stuff yourself<br>  like a pig with junk food.<br>  <br>  eat healthy... for both of you!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	do u mean because of the nuts?<br>  so many ppl get told to avoid nuts but i craved snickers so spoke to my midwife and they are 100% fine as long as you or babies dad do not have the peanut alergy so go ahead and enjoy|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Funny as in "snicker" is a synonym for "laughter"? (Yes, I'm a punny person and I pick up on puns that others don't get because they aren't intended.)<br>  <br>  I think that Takai has not had a pregnant wife or really been around anybody who is pregnant. I'm also guessing he is a male.<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant I didn't eat anything like candy bars because I didn't (don't) eat them much to begin with. Also, they're not exactly healthy for me, so they definitely would not have been good for my baby. I was particular before my pregnancy, but during I even eliminated sodas, conventional ketchup (I now eat organic), etc. If it wasn't good for me, as I said, it definitely wasn't good for the baby. <br>  <br>  I did not read anything about avoiding peanuts when pregnant until after my now 17-month-old daughter was in her first year. Eh. I lived on natural peanut butter. I would have it as a snack with whole wheat crackers. (I would buy the Kroger grocery store brand when they were on sale for $1. Unlike Wheat Thins, they only contain whole wheat and no white flour.) I would take a spoon and the jar and plop on the couch and eat it the way some people would eat ice cream. It was great for when I didn't think I had eaten well during the day and needed to compensate, or I was bored, etc. <br>  <br>  We have no history of peanut allergies or any food allergies in our family. Therefore, I'm not worried about my daughter, which is good because my husband and I can go through a jar of peanut butter in a week. Or we'll grab a hand full of peanuts for something to nibble on, etc.<br>  <br>  Yes, I did have some soda, some junk, etc., but it was very rare. I would have a can of diet Sierra Mist or natural diet ginger ale if my heartburn was acting up and the other remedies (soy milk, antacids) were not working. I bake an excellent Wacky Cake (with about ten tablespoons of cocoa and apple sauce for the oil and whole wheat flour) and would bake that for myself. (I have not yet experimented with cookies, but will do so for my daughter.... And for me). But with the soda, it might have been one a week, at most. Even now, I very rarely drink soda. There is a six pack of Hansen's root beer in our fridge that I forget about. We also have some natural cola and I thine lemon lime as well. My husband still drinks the junky soda, but that's his choice that he knows I don't like. Eh. I would eat the white bread at the restaurant or at a dinner party if I was very hungry as it was better than nothing. (I would still be sure to get in at least five grains servings. I still do.) <br>  <br>  I will probably be this way with the next pregnancy, only maybe a bit more relaxed. Maybe.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Love being a mummy - You're allowed peanuts in pregnancy, that's just a myth. <br>  <br>  Yes you can eat snickers. Don't listen to the health freaks who say it's not the healthiest choice because who the hell doesn't eat a bar of chocolate or drink a fizzy drink in pregnancy cause i sure as hell do.|`|6BhTjwoNaa	Only if you don't have gestational or other types of Diabetes should you eat a Snickers' candy bar.Too many sweets during pregnancy is not good for you or the baby.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	of course you can....you have to allow room for your cravings in your diet...if you don't you'll just want it all the more and keep trying to satisfy that with other things (which doesn't work... trust me lol)|`|ArKT9O7Maa	Probably...  What is it with pregnant women and what they eat?  Honestly, a regular diet will probably mean the baby isn't gonna die.

KOwzDLPdaa	Its very likely you could be pregnant. You had unprotected sex 10 days after your period started, which is ovulation time for most women. Sperm can also live inside you for quite a few days and get you pregnant days after you had sex when the egg is released. <br>  <br>  If you don't want this baby, you should see if you can still take Plan B three days after you had sex.|`|jZEKZdJGaa	It's likely that you could be pregnant, and maybe a little silly for having unprotected sex. I wouldn't worry until you do a test though, it's a horrible waiting game I know, but go to your doctor and they should do a test for you for free. They won't judge you, and will do their best to help you in every way possible.

OQnRP6xVaa	If you are attempting to adopt internationally then it's up to the country you are interested in adopting from. Each has the right to set their own rules and standards and the appeal if there is any would be with them if any. <br>  <br>  If you are in the US my question would be why on earth would anyone want to spend thousands and thousands of dollars to adopt a child that will likely not be under the age of 2 yrs old when there are hundreds of thousands of children in the Foster Care system waiting for adoption for Free?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you may be pretty early in this process have you considered the children waiting to be adopted right in your own neighborhood and state?<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you would need to be approved by the country you are interested in--and they set the rules for their process while adoptive parents hope that everything has been done on the up and up....|`|mldo1vxYaa	If one of you has a serious health concern you might have trouble with most adoption agencies as it wouldnt be fair on a child to lose a parent or parents twice and would only cause them more trauma, which is why they have those rules in place.<br>  <br>  I dont know what country you are in or what agency you tried to adopt with but a lot of agencies do allow an appeal but beware the decision may be the same.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I agree with Heather.  If they think it is a problem, and are willing to turn you down (because really, you had the money, which is what they are after) then perhaps you need to think of giving up.  Children deserve to have parents who can keep up with them, and if the agency thinks something is bad enough to fully decline you, they have their reasons.  Rather than finding a loophole, or badgering them... maybe you should consider that they are right in their assessment.<br>  <br>  Have you spoken with your local foster care agency?  Do they have the same concerns?  I'm afraid that you might be up a creek with this one.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It depends on what medical problems you have.  <br>  I don't know what agencies do, but the foster system physical is basically done to make sure you will be around til the child is at least 18 years of age.

uNRvZWifaa	when they put the dye in to see if the tubes are blocked(hsg) it didn't hurt me at all but it differs with everyone i only had some mild cramping while they did it. both of mine were blocked so they had to do a laparoscopy to find out why if you have that done then they put you out while they do it b/c its a surgery. I left the hospital the same day i had it done and was feeling great about 4 days later. Best of Luck!
XhIYAH6Laa	You could definitely get pregnant from that....that is not a safe method if birth control if you want to prevent pregnancy.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Well... you conceived when  you ovulated.  It's impossible to say if you had sex when you ovulated, since sperm can live for up to 5 days (rarely a bit longer) in your body.  So sex anytime from about 5 days before ovulation through the day OF ovulation can lead to pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Congratulations.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	yup you could definately get pregnant from that....but pregnancy doesnt only happen during ovulation but when you have sex on those days your chances go up significantly....sperm can live in the vagina for a few days so even if you werent ovulating when you had sex you could still get pregnant.|`|58qjx7XTaa	oh don't ever do that....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.ca/tools/ovu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.ca/tools/ovu/</a><br>  <br>  This will tell you approximately when you ovulated.  <br>  I think sperm can stay in you up to 2 or 3 days, so if you ovulated on wednesday and you had sex monday or tuesday, you could get pregnant.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	you calculate from your last period|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	yes|`|9dd1996d5fe2889ddece4c461db89465aa	Pulling out is NOT birth control although many think it is and get "caught".  Many/most men "leak" even before orgasm.  That's why is it NOT birth control.  Yes, more than likely on both of your other questions.  Use a "real" method of birth control next time and even those are not entirely a preventive because even the ones with the highest % of protection can fail sometimes for one reason or another.  The most sure birth control is abstinence.|`|AEyztU2laa	No.  It was the stork flying past the window who got you pregnant.

38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Earlier days the facilities for better education was limited. This is because of poor financial conditions. Every parent tries to understand himself that the facilities that were not available to them due to lack of money should be made available to their children. That is why they wish that their children should learn more & more. Further, in those days each family was consisting not less than 6 to 7 children.  Due to big size of family the respective parents were not in a position to take care of each & every member of the family. Only elder & younger children of the family were properly attended by the parents. Now the position has been changed. The size of family consists of not more than two children regardless of son or daughter. This is because both the parents are working. They tend to have more attention on their children as they think that their children should not blame to them for not giving proper living conditions. <br>  Earlier these parents used to blame their parents for not giving proper attention to their needs. They were not given basic  educational facilities. Naturally they think that their children should not be neglected from them. <br>  It is but natural. One should not be worried for this attitude. Parents are giving advice to study hard to other children also.|`|AA11959207	it is said that spirits of the dead with unfulfilled desires haunt old places.<br>  if the parents also behave like that(which i doubt),then there isn't much to choose between the two.<br>  <br>  school authorities on the other hand feel that parents don't take enough interest in their wards' education.<br>  <br>  thus both the opinions are just myths not borne out by the facts.<br>  <br>  but one thing is for sure that everybody wants to keep up with Jones whether it is regarding material things or with childrens' education.<br>  if you observe the lengths to which the parents go to get their children admitted to the best (?) schools,provide best paraphernalia and facilities like cycles,shoes and what not, it appears that all efforts are devoted to make good the imaginary shortfalls that parents feel that they had to endure. <br>  do you find this long enough answer?|`|SLL4sNnnaa	Todays Parents are ambitious for their sons and daughter.The reason is very simple.A Father or Mother always decides to provide the best possible things for their kids. They always expect their children to excell in everything, purely because they can not accept secondary things. They try to provide whatever that they could not get when they were children. The thing that influences these is called 'AFFECTION'.

54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	My husband wouldn't sleep with me for ages after I gave birth to our son. I had a c-section, but he got up and watched the whole procedure. He never said my vagina stinks, but trust me, my husband could get plenty nasty to get out of having intercourse.<br>  <br>  One of two things are happening here. He's either having a really hard time with the fact that you gave birth and are now a mother. In other words, he suffers from male post pardum depression... or he's cheating on you.<br>  <br>  If you're sure he's not cheating then it's PPD. Believe it or not, but men do suffer from it. I didn't know until my husband and I went to see a sex therapist.  <br>  <br>  We're still having problems with it, but since we've been to see the sex therapist things have gotten better. I don't know if your husband will get better by himself, mine swore he would, made promises every day and things just got worse. Sometimes we need a little help to fix what's wrong.<br>  <br>  I chose not to go to a conventional marriage counselor, because I read that 75% of people are the same or worse off after marriage counseling. It's up to you whether or not your want to try it.<br>  <br>  For now, I say concentrate on your baby, give your husband as much attention (non sex related) as you can and see if he's still nasty. If he's cheating, he'll start picking fights just to get out of the house, so he can go to his lover. My husband did that to me too, he cheated (although it was long before we had our son)... and the behavior he exhibited after I had our son was almost exactly the same - except I was 110% sure he wasn't cheating.<br>  <br>  The way he's treating you now, is just not fair. He should revere you for having his child. He should worship the ground you walk on. So, talk to him and ask him why he's being so nasty to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	He sounds really immature.<br>  <br>  That said, my husband pointed out that if a man wants to have sex too soon with a woman who's given birth, he obviously isn't helping with the baby enough!

What is he?  12 years old?|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	wow he has issues but there is no way i would allow my husband to talk to me like that maybe u need to look at the whole relationship is he the man u want to be with forever coz without being rude he sounds like a selfish man ( nice words incase kids read this )|`|1tmX7xbRaa	he sounds kind of dumb. maybe you should take him to counseling. it sounds to me like he is just looking for reasons to get out of having sex and he is not being nice about it. there is no reason for him to be so mean. slap him upside the head and tell him to get a clue|`|HvALvdc7aa	If he says he's sleeping around and you stink then tell him you'll find someone who can satisfy you.

I couldnt handle that $h*t.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Wow, I can't believe you haven't put his a** out of the house!  Right now you need to be supported not treated like trash.  I'm sure you have enough stress caused from the baby, the way your body looks now and hormones in general he doesn't need to be going out of his way to make you feel like crap.  Take a stand!  If you can't kick him out of the house, could you possibly stay with your parents for a little while.  Make a point that you aren't going to take his sh**.

I would notifiy the parents and demand a full medical report on him or them.  I would try and find out where it has been taking place.  I would press charges for those who are responsible.  She is considered RAPED when she is under 15.  You have a child to protect.  Do not condone what has happened, by any means.

AEyztU2laa	No.  It is not.<br>  <br>  There are few nerves in the area implantation occurs and those that are there are not very sensitive.  Sometimes the uterus will react badly to implantation which can result in cramping.  That you can feel.  A small number of cells implanting in your endometrium itself?  Not at all.  However in tune you are with your body you will not end up with more sensitive nerves in your endometrium nor a massively enlarged mass of cells at implantation anymore than being in tune with your body will make your hair turn green if you concentrate hard enough.  Of course some women think they can feel it, but some women think Elvis is still alive and that they've been abducted by aliens too.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Some women claim to feel it. Others even claim they feel ovulation. It is possible. She`ll have to wait and see if she was right or was imagining it because she wants a baby so badly.
kyoVjNpSaa	I would go ahead and go off as soon as you can and let your body regulate, but use a different form of birth control until your wedding day and the try. And i would start charting your cycles so you know how your body will be off of birth control.|`|stRWElvPaa	Hi! I have read loads of answers on here saying that they were on the pill for years (some as long as 15 years) and they came off and got pregnant within 6 months. <br>    I would say, as long as you are a healthy weight with a healthy diet, you will get pregnant almost straight away, it seems that women who have been on the pill are more fertile in the first year coming off it. <br>    Good luck with your wedding and starting a family!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhIlLxQlnGv5I6MK2ompezIjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20071001131601AAg1RYe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i got pregnant the first time we had sex after i stopped taking the pill but if you want  kids straight away, i would suggest stop taking the pill when you are ready to start trying|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Its really whenever you are ready , if you get off now you can get pregnant pretty quick , then you have to worry bout dress fitting on wedding day. You start to get a belly around 4 or 5months( a more noticable one anyway). Or you can start now and might now be prego for a while. Its really all a big chance to take. <br>  I would say wait till a month or 2 before wedding and stop taking them so you have no worries. <br>  Best of luck|`|XTf9VaLoaa	i was on the pill for 4-5 yrs n fell pregnant 2 months after i came off but im ttc now n its taking me a bit longer dr's say it take healthy people bout 1 yr to conceive but its different for every1|`|oiJITSNZaa	i'd stop amonth before Big Day|`|4hsrILZbaa	There is no guarantee that being on the pill will change your ability to become pregnant once you stop it. Women have become pregnant, after years on the pill, the same month they stop taking it. (A lot of this depends on how regular your cycles were before you began taking the pill.)<br>  <br>  My suggestion, if you truly are concerned about regulating your cycles before getting married to increase your chances of getting pregnant, is this...<br>  <br>  Stop taking the pill now, and use condoms until you are ready to become pregnant. Once you're off the pill you can count the days to figure out your normal cycle, and when you ovulate. That when, when you and your future hubby are ready to try, you'll know exactly when your fertile times are. The condoms give you control over when that happens.<br>  <br>  Best luck!<br>  <br>  And PS: My mom got pregnant, ON THE PILL with all three of her children. WIth my brother she'd been on the pill for years, at leats seven straight, and got bronchitis. The antibiotics decreased the effectiveness enough for my little brother to come into existence. So, like I said, its really more of a person by person issue.
oXzHvsBpaa	10 months is a little early for whole milk. Maybe because your baby might be allergic to the milk. I would talk to your doctor.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi you need to wait till your baby is 1year old to give whole milk. if its after every feed it may be that your baby has reflux its a muscle in the stomach that has not yet developed properly and needs medicine. see your gp.|`|rDPADat1aa	You shouldn't be giving whole milk to a 10 month old baby.  Milk isn't to be started until after the first birthday at the earliest.  Before that, you could be causing allergic issues and the baby will get an upset stomach because he/she isn't old enough to digest it yet.  Stop the milk and the baby should be fine.  If not, call your doctor.

2l7lbcJWaa	Yes, it happened to the girl that I work with. Her thyroids were messed up and it was apparently affecting her period. She didn't have one for over 6 months and ended up pregnant. The doctor told her that you can still ovulate even if you're not having a period. He said even teenage girls who haven't had a real period yet have a chance of getting pregnant. I don't know your situation, but all of this depends on the reason you are not having a period, so I would see a doctor!|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Yes, Yes, Yes,<br>  <br>  If you're going through menopause, you can still get prego after not having it for 2 years. All you need is only one egg to get fertilized.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It would depend on why you haven't had a period.  If you aren't having periods because you aren't ovulating, then obviously pregnancy isn't possible.  BUT, you can't know if/when you WILL ovulate again, so there would always be a chance that you could have intercourse at a time when you ARE just about to ovulate.<br>  <br>  Whether you  are trying to get pregnant or not, you need to see your doctor to determine what the problem is. (Unless of course, it's obvious, like you're already pregnant, breastfeeding, on birth control that stops your periods,  or menopausal.)|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i had not had a period in over a year when i found out i was pregnant, i was shocked but it turns out i randomly ovulated.  i have PCOS which is what was causing my irregular periods, check into that if you are trying to get pregnant, you may have it and there are simple medicines and treatments to help regulate you again.  if you are trying not to get pregnant then use protection, i have 2 daughters as proof that you dont have to have a regular period to get pregnant.|`|wnYn7tegaa	i would be more worried as to why u not had a period for 6 months????<br>  i would say no as if you not having a period u not releasing eggs.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Yes, you may still ovulate|`|da498dbd39048a1057d2c4954514a889aa	I personally have never had a normal period. I can easily go serveral months without a cycle. However I have been married for almost 10 years and we have never used protection and I have only became pregnant 3 times, currently on my third. Doctor said my pap came back normal and if I wanted to have normal cycles he could put me on the pill. But I wlooked at it this way, if I am ok without having one then why would I want one. Maybe if your are trying to concieve get an ovulaton kit. But my husband and I never really planned our pregnancies they just happened
2l7lbcJWaa	I think only a pregnancy test and a doctor could tell you if you're pregnant. The depo shot is probably what made your period stop; your probably going back to normal now. No, you cannot feel a two month old baby move. So yes, it's probably gas. Also, if you were pregnant from having sex on dec 8th, it would definitely show up on a test by now.|`|a6f6a6266eb16fda348c56044f9bc982aa	Its probably just gas.|`|aaea8aaa8ff942ba772575e135b0c3d1aa	its just gas<br>  <br>  you will not feel fetal movement at 2 months.<br>  <br>  take a test to confirm pregnancy first, but again it sounds like gas!!!
PHOyKsmPaa	Of course you can be pregnant.  Who told you you had to be HURT to get pregnant??|`|GjuRYsITaa	yes you most defiantly can|`|7at1Hyn8aa	Where do you get the idea that not hurting means no chance of getting pregnant?  You most definitely can get pregnant.<br>  Do not fool around with something as important as protection.  Not only does a condom help protect you from getting pregnant, it also keeps you from getting all kinds of diseases, like AIDS.<br>  Remember, you are sleeping with every person your partner has slept with before sleeping with you.|`|jhjn1QVQaa	It only takes one time to get pregnant, it can be the first or the last it doesn't matter.  You can very well be pregnant, so look out for your period.  If it's late, take a test asap.  If it's not late, then take this as a lesson learned and protect yourself if you are not ready to have a baby.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	A man doesn't even have to penetrate you to get you pregnant. You still have a  chance of getting pregnant. You need to be more careful if you aren't ready for a baby.|`|cnIzqEoDaa	There's a chance you could get pregnant. You are probably not pregnant, but if your period is late you will need to take a test. Be more careful next time, maybe get on birth control for added protection.
eytlIKITaa	No matter what, that's way too early.  <br>  How long are your cycles normally?|`|jaP0TANdaa	Unless you ovulate SUPER early (like CD5 or so), it's way too early to tell, even with a blood test from a doctor. As difficult as it is, it's best to wait until the day of your missed period (or even a few more after that) to get accurate results. I have heard many women complain of the symptoms you describe in early pregnancy, but again... too difficult to tell without knowing your ovulation day. Remember, implantation doesn't usually happen until around 7-10 DPO, at this point your body starts producing HCG (the hormone that pregnancy tests detect) and this hormone is what causes pregnancy symptoms for so many women. Usually, most women won't have any symptoms or signs of pregnancy until after implantation occurs. Good luck! Wait to see if AF shows up and if not, test again!|`|oiJITSNZaa	yes that was much too early to tell. As for your symptoms that was obviously your infection symptoms. face reality!|`|SUT3yL0oaa	The 22nd would have been way to early for a positive urine test. The fever is from the uti more than likely. The pins and needles in your hands is due to poor circulation usually and during early pregnancy your circulation usually increases due to increased blood flow to your uterus. You probably ovulated on or around the 18th so most likely the embryo wouldn't have implanted yet or if it did, it would have been in the last day or so so I don't believe your experiencing pregnancy symptoms already. Maybe you have a cold coming on? <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|crutXlguaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I am almost in the same boat. My last period was also on February 4. I started BD from the last day of my period which was the 8th of February and we had sex every day and every other day randomly up till today (February 23). I noticed really thin stretchy cervical mucus on the 20th which I think was my ovulation day cause one day prior to the stretchy mucus I also had sharp pains in my left ovary for about 30 minutes on and off in other words needle like pains. I usually have 25-29 day menstrual cycles, so I expect my period anywhere from March 1 – 5. Today I started having mild cramps in my lower abdomen and feel bloated and a little nauseous. I usually have cramps one week before my AF but this time the cramps are mild. I know that these symptoms are sometimes exactly identical when talking about AF and pregnancy. When is your next period due and when are you going to test earliest? I think I will take the first test on Feb. 27...|`|yea2hci5aa	I can't believe your doctor told you to take a hpt that early.  If you were pregnant you would of gotten a false negative.  You have to wait at least the day that you miss your period before testing.  <br>  <br>  There's always a chance of being pregnant but most of those signs could be because of your infection and also in you may just be noticing more things in your body now that you're trying to conceive.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZDQZXhcXaa	i am in exactly the same situation as u...i have a little girl and am dying to fall pregnant with my next!! the first day of my last period was 1st feb so we done it twice on the 14th also once on the 13th but then we ***** get to do it again until the 16th?!! its all just a waiting game,,the missed period is always the first clue :(|`|4hzUOmEOaa	You count from the first day of your last period out til the 12 and you ovulate the 12th,13th,and the 14th... so you ovulated 15,16,17... it works did for me and four of my friends.
oiJITSNZaa	prob too early for any symptoms. Stop gettting your hopes up|`|jaP0TANdaa	Unless you have a "perfect" cycle, those calendars are pretty much worthless. Some women ovulate much sooner than others, and some much later... there's no way to ttell with out charting (using your temps, OPK's and cervical mucus). Myself for example, I ovulate around CD11, so all of the online calendars (that use CD14 or the midpoint in your cycle for ovulation) are completely incorrect! There's a chance that you'll get lucky and I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! Personally though, I didn't find those online calendars very helpful at all!|`|4hzUOmEOaa	Well, this has worked for myself and four friends... someone that was taking a college class told me how to count when  to ovulate.. you count from the first day of you last period out to day 12, 13,14 day and you was ovulating. so you was ovulating the 12th,13th,and 14th day... since you started on the 1st.........  good luck

BUOJJpaCaa	Racism means hatred or intolerance of other races. It was a large problem in the nineteenth century, particularly African-Americans. They faced all types of discrimination simply because of their race. These ideas existed into the twentieth century and still exist today. However, America has made a lot of progress on this issue in the past forty years.

I would a week or two and take a test before you get all excited.  What kind of signs do you have when you ovulate?  The tiredness is a definite indicator.  That's how my best friend knew she was pregnant with her 3rd before she was even due to get her period!  Good luck!

I didn't have as many symptoms, all I had was sore nipples. I would wait another week and take a pregnancy test. Good luck. Oh and if you can go and get a blood test you should do that so you don't have to wait and you'll know for sure. Good luck!|`|65RZ441Zaa	Well good luck!

C0I1YahGaa	Those sound like pregnancy symptoms to me! Do you have any cramping? I had cramping that felt just like I was going to start my period but then I never did. That was my biggest symptom and from what I hear a common one. I also had headaches too, BAD, but they went away after the 1st trimester. From what my doctor said symptoms can start immediately.

Have 2 kids myself and both acted very differently to getting them and some side affects not kicking in right away which Dr. did say was normal, and it could be just getting sick.

Some kids react badly to their shots.|`|laVR7f1Faa	He could of had a little reaction to the shot. just make sure he is drinking and he should ;be better soon.

I know people in other states who are getting over it, and people in my state (OK) are getting it, now... Seems unlikely it's from the shots, and if it's short-lived, I'd guess it's a bug.
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Male sperm are faster than female sperm,but they don't last as long. If you were ovulating,then I'd say there's a very good chance. <br>  As far as how fast they swim,I have no idea.<br>  <br>  _edit_<br>  Apparently the guy below me hasn't read many fertility books,or stayed awake in biology for that matter...<br>  Which of the man's sperm fertilizes the egg,determines the sex. (XX Chromosome being female) and the (XY Chromosome being male)<br>  Depending on when your egg released is also a big factor. In guessing which sperm were left or hanging around then could have penetrated the egg,or doing so now.<br>  You can also check out this link,might be some helpful info.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	wtf is female sperm? You mean eggs?<br>  <br>  Sperm swims at 8 inchph, however it doesn't really swim in a straight line to the egg and can take a while to get there.|`|oiJITSNZaa	patience! worrying about it can keep you from conceiving
0x8Q6rFPaa	It's obviously not in the best interests of the children.  It's a matter of the adults wanting what they want, and seeing that "everyone else" gets that without being raked over the coals to see how fit they are.<br>  <br>  But adoptive parents are asking to raise someone else's child, and that means they must be held to a higher standard.  If they can't deal with that--if they've not only been judged unfit but also feel entitled to cheat--they aren't stellar parenting material anyway.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	It certainly cannot be in the best interests of anyone but themselves.  If someone cannot reasonably expect to provide a child adequate care throughout the duration of its childhood, it's not in the child's best interest that they adopt.  Even if the other spouse is healthy, an adopted child has already suffered the loss of their parents.  Placing them in a family where the loss of an adoptive parent is highly likely is just plain cruel.  Some health conditions place a child in danger of physical harm.  If that's the case, how could they live with themselves knowing they placed a child in harm's way just to satisfy their own needs?|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	Maybe they feel they have been wronged.  I know we did have problems with one social worker, who had very serious problems with the fact that my husband was staying home and not me and expressed this concern.  I spoke to her supervisor and all is well (got new worker a.s.a.p.), but I bet some people may be found unsuitable for reasons that are not legitimate, so yes they could go somewhere else.  They would have to declare that they were turned away somewhere else though.<br>  <br>  That said, I think you are wondering about entitlement, and all I can say is that people who are desperate will not see the whole picture.  Have we not met people in our lives who nothing is their fault?  They lost their job, spouse, etc. etc. but nothing is their fault, always the other guy?  Of have you wanted something soooo bad that you did not see how you were hurting others?  This may be the case with some potential adoptive parents, and it is someone's job along the way to help them see the bigger picture.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Something I hear often, "oh, and how many biological parents are abusing their kids???  Hmmm???  And I can't adopt because of this stupid little thing."  Sounds like selfishness to me.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	I guess I would only want to know why they might have been found unfit for a certain type of adoption. I can understand why a parent say, over 40 would not be found fit for a new born but perhaps if that same parent considered a child rather then and infant the situation could be different. I think someone unfit for one type of adoption process may not be for another type.. <br>  <br>  When we adopted we didn't believe we should even consider a newborn due to our age and wanted to be around long enough to actually be at our children's high school graduation.<br>  There may be reasons one type of adoption is not best for parents which may not mean all types of adoption will be. <br>  <br>  I would want to know why the parents were considered unfit before I completely judged the motivations of a continued interest? If based on health, age or marital status these issues may not be the same for other types of adoption.|`|95a20e2cc1684a87892792f1ec1fbefaaa	Some people are selfish. Some may actually be convinced they'd be the perfect parent. I can tell you from my situation and my husbands; we were both adopted, even some people who ARE eligible to adopt should have never been given a child. We were both raised with abusive/dysfunctional 'parents'. Sometimes, maybe 'God' of whoever was telling them something when he made them incapable of having children in the first place. Then again, I've met some wonderful people who deserve babies who cannot have them.<br>  People who are denied should maybe be watched? But as they say, if there's a will, there's a way.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	It isn't in the best interest of the children.  I can tell you that much.  Especially in the cases where they are going through a private agency.  Their main goal is to make money, so I can only imagine how serious something would be to deter them from doing business with someone.  Rules are rules, and in adoption, rules are in place in order to help children grow up in the best place available.<br>  <br>  If someone is going to go through appeals or try to find a back way in, shame on them.  They need to come to grips with the reasons for why they are turned down.  If they cannot be changed, then perhaps they need to rethink parenting all together.  I'm not saying they wouldn't be great parents, but something is obviously keeping an agency from approving them.  <br>  <br>  If it were me, and I were hell bent on adopting (which wouldn't happen, though) I would perhaps try one more place before giving up, but if they turned me down, I'd give up.  I would find a new purpose and throw myself into that.  Unfit is unfit.  These children don't need to go into a home where problems are already evident.  They need the best chances for a "normal" childhood possible.|`|rdKuvxYJaa	wow what is this world coming to. these people once they are proving unfit to adopt or have children period should be put on a registry all across the world for ALL agencies and child welfare offices to read and adhere by so that these people will NEVER have a child in there homes EVER.|`|3i7hufq4aa	What HappyMom said. I wish more agencies would put more thought into matching appropriate kids in need, with appropriate families, instead of just taking the next cookie-cutter in line.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I think it's selfishness. Desperation.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Depends on the basis for rejection, IMHO.<br>  <br>  For example: requirements for an international adoption program vary from country to country.  Some countries require PAPs to be in a certain age range, others don't.  Some require marriage, some don't.  Some allow homosexual couples to adopt, some don't.  Some are very stringent as far as medical history (rejection on the basis of having been on an antidepressant for a short time, like ten years ago, for example), others look at the "bigger picture."  <br>  <br>  So if someone is rejected, or is unable to be a  candidate based upon something like their age or marital status, or any factor that doesn't have an impact on their ability to parent, I don't see it as "entitlement" if they choose another program.  <br>  <br>  If someone is rejected for something like home safety, criminal background, psychological issues, severe heath issues, then yes, that is another matter entirely and they shouldn't try to find a loophole.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I don't know about "trying to get around it" but as with anything there is the right of appeal in matters such as this.  Yes, regulations exist and they exist for a good reason but at the same time they are normally interpreted by administrative decision makers who have a certain degree of discretion and the ability to interpret the regulations.  It is this interpretation and discretion that is often appealed.  Sometimes, and we all know it, the rules and regulations are not applied equally.  If it turns out that they have been and someone doesn't qualify then that should be it but unless there is any master registry or overall list of who is disqualified you will always find those who try to get around the rules and regulations regardless of what the matter is.
9a3sNrEqaa	I don't really know what it could be I just want to send you tonsss of baby dust!!!!!!!!!!! <3<3
wWyChyYiaa	Hmmm...the temperature spike is more along the line that you did actually ovulate.  The fact that you have a cramping in your ovary (left or right side) will basically tell you which ovary you are ovulating from.  I remember that pain really well.  It takes the egg more than a few days to move from the ovaries into the uterus.  It could be the anticipation of wanting to conceive~because I remember that also.  <br>  <br>  Some tips...when you and your hubby try next month (that is if you are not pregnant now~nature plays a crazy trick of having the symptoms of pregnancy correspond so closely to that of your period~yes it sucks)..would be to have him start eating cinnamon, vanilla, and oysters.  All three of these things have been known to increase fertility in males.  I always kept cinnamon Altoids or vanilla mints close by all the time.  I would also start having sex a few days before you are about to vulate.  It will give you a better chance for conception.  Since sperm can live for a day inside you...it will give you a better chance.  Also...remember to have sex every othr day...make sure you give him a day to rest and rejuvinate between the days you have sex.  The best positioning in one your back with a pilow under your butt....and to keep it there and lay there relaxing with the pillow still under you for approximately 20 minutes after he is done.<br>  <br>  I hope any or all of this helps.  If you are think you are pregnant...go to your doc and have them run the blood test so you know for sure.  Good Luck and keep us posted!!!!!!!!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Definitely sounds like a possibility of pregnancy dear!!!!  I had sore nipples when I was pregnant with my son.  I remember my breast didn't hurt, but my nipples did.  Ohhhh, I would be so happy and thrilled for you if you ended up being pregnant!!!!|`|fWAzJIEkaa	Sounds like u have done everything right..I dont think it matters what positions u hold urself.. it only takes 1 =)<br>  <br>  Im experiencing the exact same symptoms.. so im hoping, hoping hoping this has been my month!<br>  <br>  Wait til ur late on ur period and do ur test!<br>  Hope u get ur BFP!<br>  Let me know how u get on, have my fingers crossed for u! x|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Ooooh i think you should go buy a test!! Sore breasts were my first sign i was pregnant. This started 3 days after my period was supposed to be here so i bought a test which showed a very clear pos!! :)
wTYh7DiSaa	The one you are referring to is, progesterone suppositories/pill/injections. I've used the progesterone injections for both of my pregnancies, the one last year and my current one (37 weeks and 1 day woohoo). Usually this is given to women who have preterm deliveries and such but, I've heard of women using it before the 16th week.<br>  <br>  I too have had 2 miscarriages back to back, in fact only 4 months apart each time. I continued to carry my 14 month old son and my daughter who is  comfy in my tummy right now and don't seem to want to come out lol. Be strong, think positive and pray.. you will get through this and you will be fine.|`|m1fA1G4daa	I know exactly what your feeling and what your going through. I have had 7 miscarriages. I do have 2 boys now in between all of the miscarriages. I have never heard of any meds to prevent a miscarriage. The only thing I have heard of is if you are several months along and are going into preterm labor they can give you something to try to stop the labor.<br>  <br>  You can add me as a contact here if you need someone to talk too about this experience. Don't give up.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	as horrible as it sounds miscarriage in the first trimester happen for a reaosn. it's not your fault. it was a problem when the sperm and egg joined your body knows there is something seriously wrong with the pregnancy. just because you had two does not mean this egg will have ANYTHING wrong with it.  i thought i was having one and my doctor told me "even if we could stop it we wouldn't want to". good luck sweety! i hope everything turns out okay!|`|S6QpB8QZaa	I know it is hard to just sit back and wait when you are so scared. I found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks and I had miscarried twice before also. I still have fears and I am 14 weeks now which is well beyond the 7 and 9 week mark that my miscarriages happened. I was told there isn't such thing as a pill to stop a miscarriage but there are shots later on in a pregnancy.  Best thing to do is take it easy and try to keep your stress level down.  I seen my OB at almost 8 weeks and when I seen that little heartbeat flutter on the ultrasound screen it was worth all the waiting. I will pray you get great results. Congrats!|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	I've never heard of a pill that helps you not miscarry.  I've had several miscarriages myself--the last one being 4 years ago this May--and I was told there was absolutely nothing that could be done about it if you're less than 12 or 16 weeks along.  I was nearly 19 weeks when I lost my last one, and nothing could be done about it.  Now that you're older, maybe you eat better and treat yourself better than when you were younger, and you'll be ok.  I know your past scares you, but you need to keep thinking positive thoughts and take care of yourself--lots of rest and good food.  Good luck honey!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No,honey. These things are just hope and chance. The number one cause of a miscarriage is chromosomal abnormalities,and there's nothing you can do to prevent that. There are no pills,no magic potions. Just because you've had two miscarriages,doesn't mean you will have a third.
HdACu5Bpaa	Hugs to you honey, it so sad when you lose your baby, i have had a miscarriage to and you can imagine what that did to me and my hubby. We are still trying though, i am due today but still no sign of AF :). Anyways after my miscarriage it took me almost two months before i got my period. But as you know every woman is unique, so no one can really tell when you will start getting yours. Its all depends on your body and what you eat. Just stay healthy, you wont have a problem with that.|`|UMusJPDkaa	I had a miscarriage on the 26th Jan, I was almost 12 weeks. I haven't got my period as yet but I do have stomach cramps like something is going to happen soon. I have had the cramps for a week now. I am getting a bit obsessive about it now though as I want to start trying again. Good Luck|`|fMilDRgLaa	So sorry for your miscarriage. I had mine November 2002.  The signs of my first period was right after the new year.  It took about 7 weeks.  Once I had my period it was clock work for a few months and then went to a crazy schedule, but I had a crazy schedule prior to the miscarriage.
pvH3oHRfaa	Last night! My daughter is 6 months and has just decided that she doesn't like strangers, or any man that isn't her dad!<br>  <br>  We've been at my parents house all weekend no problem. She sees my dad about once a week or every fortnight, and loves him to bits. But out of the blue last night she decided she was now scared of him, and wouldn't stop crying when she looked at him! We couldn't work out for ages what was wrong with her, it' so weird!<br>  <br>  This morning though, she was smiling at him again. She fickle isn't she! Although now she's scared of her dad's dressing gown hanging on the back of the bathroom door, and cries whenever she sees that?!|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Maybe the person scared your child, I have 5 kids and they never did that , atleast not untill they where 1 to 2 yrs...|`|DIZKlxNraa	My baby never did that. He is almost 9 months and loved strangers right from the begining.|`|tArNKJnQaa	well my baby never freaks out, just a normal kid|`|T0gv52CDaa	I'm the nursery director at my church, and I notice that it is usually around 8 months that the kids start not wanting to be left and freaking out when their parents drop them off.  With most of them, this is only for a few minutes until they get distracted with a toy or decided that the nursery worker holding them isn't so bad.  This frequently go continues  until the child is old enough to understand that Mommy & Daddy are going into the service and will be back to pick them up soon.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	My Daughter started doing this around 5 months...She would panic, and freak out if it wasnt a family member...and even sometimes if it was a family member she didnt see often she would scream, and cry!<br>  <br>  It is actually a good thing. Because like you said, its good they know the difference between a stranger and family...|`|4pXQxKMbaa	My baby is in the 5th month and she gets scared sometimes...though I wouldn't call it freaking out...she puckers her lip and starts to cry a very sad little cry. She just doesn't like being in a new place with someone she doesn't know. She's been doing this for several weeks now...even if her dad comes home after not being home all day sometimes she gets scared like that. <br>  It's normal.|`|I358NcRIaa	well my son who now is 8 almost 9 mons old started to have that separation thing about 2 1/2 months old and til this day he still has it i cant even go to the bathroom without him crying, its the same with his father|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I think my daughter was somewhere around 4 or 5 months when she started to cry if someone she didn't know picked her up. After a few hours, she got better...but if she saw me she'd still whine until she was in my arms. She's a little better now (7mos) but she'll still reach for me or lean towards me if someone else is holding her.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	First of all, that was pretty harsh the way you reacted to Greg G. I don't know that he was necessarily implying that your child is not normal. If you are on here asking the question than there is obviously something going on that isn't completely normal.<br>  <br>  That being said, my son is almost 5 months and is only like that a little. Last week when his grandpa was in town he cried every time he held him and I think it was because he doesn't know him. I wouldn't say he freaks out though. He generally lets everyone hold him, but will act a bit shy. Your baby just has her own personality and sounds like she loves her mommy.

8t8NjjnVaa	I'm sorry but you're experiencing what pretty much every mother does in the beginning.  I know that doesn't make it any easier, but it is normal!<br>  <br>  You have to look at it from your daughter's perspective.  Up until just a few days ago, she was all snuggled up in your warm and cozy uterus.  Now she's out here in this totally different world.  It's completely NORMAL and natural for her to need your love, comfort, and touch in order to sleep.  <br>  <br>  You can try swaddling, a white noise machine, or a vibrator for the bed and see if any of those help.  It never helped either of my two daughters, but it's worth a shot.  If it doesn't work, then you just have to deal with it.  <br>  <br>  I know you're exhausted...all new moms are!  Believe me, I know.  My daughter had reflux and getting her to sleep even right on top of me was a chore.  I was pretty much a zombie for the first 8 months of her life!<br>  <br>  Regarding your eye...it could be lack of sleep or any number of things.  Keep an eye on it.<br>  <br>  See a doctor about it if:<br>  ~it doesn't go back to normal in a day or so<br>  ~it gets worse<br>  ~it has discharge<br>  ~it is red/bloodshot<br>  ~it is itchy<br>  ~it is painful<br>  ~it spreads to the other eye<br>  ~it interferes with your vision<br>  ~if you have any other unexplained symptoms|`|DDFSITiYaa	You don't mention her age but the newborn stuff is hard.  The best advice I can give is to do what works in the early weeks.  <br>  <br>  However, swaddling was a big thing with us and once done correctly, seems to soothe most newborns into feeling safe and secure. <br>  <br>  There are an unlimited number of books on getting babies to sleep - the best ones I have found are Happiest Baby on the Block for newborns and Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems as a reference for many years.|`|955YoHvVaa	Sometimes you have to do what you have to do and if her sleeping in bed with you means you get more sleep, I'd go for it..you can try cosleeping for a few months and then transitioning into a crib when a sleep routine has been established we did that with my daughter until we moved into our house and now shes back in bed with us..|`|AA11637393	I would try swaddling. Like they do in the hospital They make swaddling blankets.  Or do it yourself.  You need a large baby blanket.  Fold it in a triangle(from corner to corner).  Make sure to wrap tightly where she can't get it unwrapped|`|u1DDrXO2aa	your babys only 9days old what do you expect its a baby its not a walk in the park i know it seems early to try to do it but come up with some type of routine every night so she gets used to what you doing its hard but if you keep up with it should set in try to pick a time you want her to go down my son wouldnt sleep until 1030 1130 and i tried to do the same thing every night give him a baby put bed time lotion on him bottle and rock him he was out for a 3hrs until he was 2 months then he slept through the nite hes 4 months now and still has that routine every nite make sure she has stomach new diaper make her comfortable. Most babys have there nights and days mixed up take advantage sleep when you can...good luck|`|dbd1e999d2db32deb12894e60c629053aa	Lack of sleep for the eye unless it has drainage or any king of warm redness around it. I have a 6 month old and for the longest time I thought he would never be able to sleep in his crib alone but he does fine now. But at first we had to get him to sleep in his swing i have a fisher price papasan swing and he would sleep so well in it. Eventually i made a slow transfer to the crib and now he sleeps so great all by himself. We started putting him in his swing to sleep very early on  that way we could get some sleep. Maybe this will work for you. Good luck|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	She sounds like my daughter! She would only sleep swaddle wrapped laying on her stomach, laying on my stomach with me patting her back! That was for about the first 4 months, and I was exhausted continuously! I wish I could give you some advice, but just try to stick it out. it does get better! My daughter is now a very happy 2 year old!|`|7lPspOboaa	They have a bassinet called a co-sleeper.  It is a baby bed that attaches to your bed but is a separate bed.  It worked quite well for me.  <br>  <br>  You may allow co-sleeping for a few nights for you to get some rest yourself.  Then try swaddling or changing her position a bit so she is more comfortable.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Your eye could be lack of sleep or eye irritation, keep a watchful eye out on it (no pun intended). Someone suggested to me that babies like to smell mommies.  When my son had a hard time going from bassinet to crib this is what I did.  I wore a nightshirt for a couple of days and got my "smell" on it.  Then I put it in his crib(not anywhere where he could get wrapped up or suffocated on it).  I also bought a vibration unit(that went in his crib) that I could turn on when he started fussing.  That helped a lot.  Are you putting her in a separate room?  If so, make sure the night time conditions in your room (where she sleeps well) and her room are the same.  Dark, quiet, etc. rooms work.  Both of my children have some sort of air purifier for background noise in their rooms.  Good luck to you!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Sounds like you and your hubby need to take turns letting each other sleep. Even if it is just for a couple hours at a time.<br>  <br>  As for her wanting to sleep next to you... have you tried swaddling? It'll make her feel safe and secure.<br>  <br>  Other than that caffeine was my best friend during those first few months. I drank so much diet Mountain Dew I may as well have owned stock in the company. =)<br>  <br>  Congrats on your new baby! =)|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	What we did with my son was played running water in the bedroom.  The "white noise" helped him to sleep for longer periods of time.  Fisher Price makes a cute little aquarium that plays this, which we had, but we later just made a CD of it and played that so it went all night long, instead of only for 15 minutes.  We also slept him upright until he was rolling over, since he hated being on his back.  He slept some in his bouncy chair placed inside his crib. But at like one month old he was wiggling out of it, so we put him into his infant carrier at night, placed inside his crib. Plus you have the receiving blankets up the sides (but we kept them down low so that he couldn't accidentally pull one in his face), so he felt like he was being held.  Then once he was 3 months old he was rolling all over the place, so we put him to bed on his belly.  He is now almost 3 years old and is a perfect little sleeper!<br>  <br>  For my daughter, she wanted to sleep on someones chest for the sound of the heartbeat.  So we bought her a heartbeat monitor.  The heartbeat bears were so cute, but again, only play for 15 minutes or so, whereas the machine would play all night long.  This helped so much for her, and she actually slept swaddled in her bassinet on her back until she was big enough to roll over and went into a crib!
Wps4XuqHaa	I have 3 kids and i was induced everytime!! My 1st was 7lb 9oz, my second was 7lb 5oz and my 3rd was 7lb 2oz so they shrunk in size and i was 41 weeks with each of them. So dont worry that this baby will be bigger than last time if u go over!!|`|AA11637393	i had the opposite thing happen - my first 2 were early and my 3 never would come and I had to be induced.  I think there is no way to tell and each baby is different|`|DeXRWlR6aa	My first was 41weeks EXACTLY & she weighed 9lbs. We weren't induced or anything, I had a midwife. I am 28wks pregnant w/our second and our midwife is going to keep an eye on this baby for size. Second babies supposedly aren't as likely to be late. Like the others have said, each pregnancy is different. You never know what to expect. You can try Evening Primrose Oil Capsules when you are around 37 weeks (check w/your dr beforehand) these are used to soften your cervix which helps once your body is ready for labor. Babies come when they are ready! I'm anxious for the arrival of our son but still have 3 months!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Every pregnancy is different reagrdless if you delivered late with baby 1, doesn't mean it'll happen again with #2 (but it also doesn't mean that it won't.) <br>  <br>  Walk a alot (30 minutes a day is nice and healthy, even if it's in two 15 minute walks.) Sex daily (or nearly daily) in the last 1-2 months of pregnancy is great - allow dad to ejaculate inside of you - semen has a chemical in it that is similar to the chemical our body's produce when in labor (of course we produce alrger amount of but this still helps a whole lot) and so it'll help to soften up (and contract) your uterus.* <br>  <br>  Congratulaions, mom and good luck!|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	both kids born almost 2 weeks past their due date, labor started naturally but ended with c-section both times....<br>  <br>  1st baby 8lbs 8oz<br>  2nd baby 7lbs 14oz|`|myEwHgI1aa	I was induced at 41 weeks with baby #1, and currently 42 weeks with baby #2...midwife says when you are induced your body will "remember" the pitocin and "wait" for it, making it a longer pregnancy. If you went that long with your first, good chance of it happening again.
ciG5yrgFaa	i've had the same problem.  one thing i found, but haven't tried, was a suggestion to put cabbage leaves inside your bra!  they're cold, have the natural cup shape to them.  i just told my hubby "don't touch!" on fear of death.  i wear a sports bra during the day and one that is just barely too big when i go to bed.  helps keep them constantly supported and it does help!|`|rYNM67oyaa	This article suggests several things to try, including hot or cold compresses and wearing a maternity sleep bra. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4570863_breast-soreness-last-during-pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4570863_bre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arabella-Sleep-Bra-Maternity-Nursing/dp/B000GTPJUG" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Arabella-Sleep-Bra...</a>|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I don't think there is any.

EtCRnDJMaa	maybe you need to turn her over your knee|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Her life is in turmoil right now.  She's trying to get someone to notice how scared she is, how lost she feels.  <br>  <br>  Sit down and talk to her.  Bring it back to basics.  Let her know that you can see she's feeling out of control & ask her how she feels about that.  If she's feeling safe and speaking from her heart directly to yours, she will let you know she hates when she's acting like that.  <br>  <br>  Then, let her tell you how she's feeling.  Let her get it all out.  Once you really understand the world from her 8yo perspective, from *your heart*, help her find her way back.  Help her be the person she wants to be every day, confident, loved, secure, safe - knowing that her parents (both of you) are still there, to help her learn from her mistakes and love her anyway.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  It is not an age thing.  It is from years of spineless parenting.  You have allowed things to get this way.  She knows quite well what she can get away with.  You have allowed it.<br>  <br>  Make the rules.  Write them down.  Give her a copy and discuss it with her.  Tell her the punishment for not following the rules.  <br>  <br>  This is the hard part - then you have to be consistent in enforcing the rules and the punishments.  If you are not consistent it will not work.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	she does anything she can to just annoy me and my partner.....her dad and i are getting divorced.....she doesn't behave like that when she's with him and his gf....<br>  <br>  think about all those variables for a moment --- then ask yourself what is going on with your little girl. <br>  <br>  not that i'm saying you should give up your life for your child, but maybe it should be on the back burner - or perhaps her wellbeing could be a higher priority. sorry.|`|Ll0182h9aa	if she hits then you should just put her in time out and have a chat with her. be as tough as you can and try your hardest. good luck!!!!|`|RF2YV9ataa	This is nothing that a good old fashinoned azz whupping cant handle.  Your daughter is beyond talking to at this point and she just needs a little parental discipline, that is not to say that you aren't disciplining her, it just means that she is old enough to reap the consequences of her actions.  It is NOT ok to talk back to you or any other adult and running around as if SHE pays the bills is not ok either.  You arent a bad parent by taking a belt to her behind she is just getting way out of control and needs to be taught a lesson.  It will teach her respect.  And by the way there is a difference between an azz whupping and a beating, i am by no means saying beat your child senseless im just saying she needs a little more than time out and some hurt feelings after doing this a few times she will definately get the idea|`|124377045ceac9826f76a176d439bd8faa	Just to second the other comments--get a paddle and start using it!!!|`|668551ae8f7b043f957455c854361b2daa	forget little time out ; wat the hell do those do ?!<br>  NOTHIN AT ALL !<br>  beat her asssssssssssss ! *|`|1h5RpINNaa	It sounds to me that you just need to be stricter with her.  When you say something own it and follow through with it.  It will be stressful to change the behavior but the sooner you start the less embedded it is in her head to fight it off.  Stay consistent, if you send her to timeout for one thing you can't let it go another time.  Some of the acting out can be that she is reacting to the divorce but you can be sensitive to her needs with that but still let it be known that these are mommy's rules and you still have to follow them.  Try spending some one on one time with her daily, she might shift to being better behaved just from that as well.|`|e60hNP76aa	I think it is time to set up some rules of behavior for her - quickly.  You also need to be the boss, don't let her tell you what to do - you are the parent so BE the parent.  She thinks she is driving the ship at your house and it seems like her Dad won't tolerate that kind of behavior at his place - which is good and you seem to think her behavior is better at his house so time to do what he does.  Don't do what he does to make her afraid of you (as you have concerns about with her and her Dad already) but follow some of his tactics that lead towards the behavior that you want her to have at your home too.<br>  <br>  Hitting is not tolerated, she goes to her room ASAP, you take away her favorite possession (blanket, bear, pillow etc) right away (give back when she is being good - or else it can stay away for the rest of the day/week).  You may have a screaming mad little girl but by the third time you take away what she loves and treasures she will be thinking quickly that oh gee maybe I shouldn't hit my sister cuz I miss my (favorite toy).  You should also take away privileges for bad behavior like no TV, or no movies, no Ipod or Game boy when she acts out. <br>  <br>  If she won't clean up, you bring out a garbage bag and put it all in the bag and tell her it is all going to the garbage - then take it to the garage or shed/basement - out of her sight. Okay so I can't really throw the toys away, but I have put it in the bag and put the bag in the garage by the garbage and waited a few days to bring some of the items back in the house - when we had better behavior - not all the toys right away or they see thru it.  I know several friends who use this when the kids won't clean up and oh yes it works, she will certainly be cleaning up next time for fear that it will all go away.<br>  <br>  Don't take away time outside or time to rider her bike or playtime on the swing - she should be encouraged to do that more than being inside (if it is winter where you live then bundle her up and she can play in the snow in the yard).  Encourage this more than anything, fresh air and activity really helps kids when they are having difficulties. <br>  <br>  One lady I met didn't like time outs, she liked time ins.  What is the difference - well a time in is like a hug in, and you just sit and hold her, you wrap your arms around her and don't let her go until she finally calms down and stops screaming, crying, hollering, kicking, fighting - you give her your complete attention - it may take a while and you may end up with a bruised shin but the connection with the kids is what they are wanting, she wants your attention and she will soon realize that she has it. <br>  <br>  You have to take action quickly and it may be hard at first, you are feeling badly for her and your making it easier for her to get away with bad behavior by letting her get away with things that you really don't want her doing.  Time to buckle down - sorry it is the only way to regain control of this wonderful 8 year old who needs your guidance or else she will just spiral out of control and really become a troubled little girl.  She is a little girl remember, she is your daughter whom you love and adore, she is needing your help in her life, and I bet you need her help too.  Maybe you need to do some fun things together, get your toes painted at a salon or see a movie just you two (when her behavior improves).  You can use this as a goal to work towards for her, tell her you have something special for you to do when she acts like a big girl/good girl.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, be strong with her, don't let her walk all over you, you will get thru this but you will need to be the strong one - because you are the Mom, her Mom and she needs you too!
oiJITSNZaa	you need to read more and get more familiar with how your body works!|`|L3uqvJTPaa	okay what u need to do since your not sure on what your cycle day is then have sex every other day from the 26th  to the 8th thats what my fertily dr. told me to do. or you can also buy an opk "ovalution prediction kit" and test everyday|`|xpebvAaiaa	I highly recommend the book Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler.

8t8NjjnVaa	NO!  Never give a baby water, especially one that young!  It's very dangerous actually, even small amounts could lead to water intoxication which can kill a baby quite quickly. <br>  <br>  Water should not be given to a child at least until they start solids, which shouldn't be until he is at least 6 months old.<br>  <br>  The reason your 3-week-old son is waking two times a night is because he's 3 weeks old!  He needs to eat very often because his tummy is so tiny.  <br>  <br>  If he wakes up to eat, feed him!  He needs it.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Water is not poison, but your baby's stomach is very, very tiny.  If he wants to drink, it should be breast milk or formula.  Water would fill his stomach, and might give him the illusion that he is full, but he would not be getting the nutrients that he needs.<br>  <br>  There is a reason that babies wake so frequently.  Newborns need to eat.  "Thirst" is almost irrelevant.|`|RF2YV9ataa	No giving a baby water at this point is VERY dangerous water will dillute the sodium in their blood giving them thrush, jaundice, or a host of other medical problems.  I know i couldnt believe it at first either but they shouldnt drink water technically for the first year if breastfeeding but they will be fine to drink water at 6 months|`|AA10624857	It is recommended to give babies only breast milk or formula until 6 months (some doctors will say 4 months). A baby has a very tiny tummy and it needs to be refilled often. For breast feeding babies it isn't unusual for them to want to nurse every 1-3 hours around the clock. Formula fed babies may go a bit longer and be content for 2-4 hours. Both breast milk and formula contain a high amount of water so additional water isn't necessary. At this point in your baby's development, water is simply an empty calorie tummy filler so it is best to avoid additional water (unless a doctor has instructed it's use for a medical reason). If he is waking up, he is likely hungry. All of his sustenance is liquid so his thirst is quenched at the same time his hunger is. Skip water for now and introduce it when he is at least 6 months old plus is eating solids. Giving water to babies used to be a common practice, but as medical advancements are reached and research and studies are done, the evidence shows that additional water is not necessary and can be harmful. There is a condition called oral water intoxication that has some serious potential problems associated with an imbalance of sodium. The 2 groups of people most susceptible to water intoxication are athletes and babies under 6 months old. Your baby is growing at an amazing speed and needs the vitamins and nutrients that only breast milk or formula can offer him. Don't give him any plain water.  ADDED:  If your son wakes up but doesn't want a bottle of formula than he won't likely take water, either, because hunger or thirst isn't what is waking him up.  He may have a tummy hurt and needs a burping or he may have gotten too hot or too cold.  He may also be lonely and just needs to be comforted.  He spent most of his life nestled close to you and now he has been thrust out on his own.  Sometimes babies just need some snuggling and cuddling.  Your baby doesn't yet experience thirst as his only source of nourishment is in liquid form so his thirst is constantly quenched before it develops.  Stick with only breast milk or formula and if he wakes without being hungry try rocking with him, burping him, swaddling him, or changing his diaper.|`|DDFSITiYaa	No he's not thirsty - he is a newborn!  No water yet. <br>  <br>  He is waking up because that is what newborns do.  Try swaddling him.  <br>  <br>  3 weeks was always the 'magic' age where they started really waking up and doing all kinds of things that defy logic.  Get used to it, the sleep patterns don't really emerge until a few more months.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Do not give him water.  Water isn't necessary for young babies, and may be harmful. He gets all the water he needs from his formula or breastmilk. <br>  <br>  If he wakes, offer food.  He's a newborn and still needs to eat often, both day and night.|`|UghJ0XROaa	A baby that young doesn't need water, they need breast milk or formula and that's it!|`|9z6PYxv9aa	they don't need water - they get everything they need from breast milk or formula until 9 months. Giving him water is just empty cals and your baby will burn cals drinking the water. but not get any in. Our baby is 4 months and still wakes every 2 hours for a snack...just how babies are.|`|T0gv52CDaa	Water wont hurt him, but it still isn't recommended.  It will fill his belly, but provide no nutritive value, so he will not feel hungry when it is time for him to eat, and he will be missing out on needed calories.  If you think he is not hungary, try just giving him a pacifier.|`|AA11637393	no,no,no you don't give your baby water.  He probably isn't thirsty he probably needs to suck.  Babies have a need to suck - give him a pacifier.  I told my doctor about my babies waking up and he said that a pacifier won't hurt them at this age.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	No a 3 week old should not have water.  He'll start sleeping better in a few weeks/months when he's on cereals.
oWAUb6vpaa	Hopefully you stay pregnant for at least another 2 weeks to ensure maturity of baby's lungs, but regardless here are some of the signs of labor: <br>  <br>  Signs: <br>   - tightening of your belly (relaxes then tightens again) (over the course of several hours) <br>   - cramps front &/or back (steady or on & off) - (over the course of several hours) <br>   - losing mucus plug (in pieces or in whole) - usually thick and white & sometimes tinged with pink or red blood (can happen at any time from now until actual delivery day) <br>   - you could also have pressure in your vagina from the baby's weight since baby has moved lower into your pelvis (more pressure than what you may have been feeling - heavier) <br>   - if you feel a trickle or gush of fluid it could be your amniotic sac has ruptured (water broke) and you'd need to call your doc's office asap (and go to emergency room for delivery) * <br>  <br>  Walking will not stop real contractions (as Braxton Hicks usually let up from walking.) The uterine pain and contractions continue to increase in level, duration and frequency.) <br>  <br>  Hope I didn't leave anything out and hope this helps you! <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|MbmHripJaa	you may not notice it but many people may tell you that you have "dropped" meaning your stomach looks lower which means the baby is getting ready to push her way out. Also if your mucus plug comes out..with my first child i was having contractions once every few hours for days and then my mucus plug came out and i went to the hospital that night-- so really if you want to have the baby early you can start by walking up and down stairs.. lol.|`|AA11637393	trust me when you have real contractions you will know it.  They will be a pattern to them.  They will start every 30 minutes or so and then every 15 minutes and then every 5 minutes etc.  If this is your first you may have a long way to go.  A lost of women go 40 weeks or more|`|OuuYoSBeaa	its really hard to explain to someone if they have never have not gone through labor before, but you will just know when you have a real contraction. They can be described as intense mentstrual cramps either in your lower back or sides. if you time them, and they are consistant and get closer together, this would be labor, but if they are speratic and stop, then its most likely braxton hicks. you will have another doctors appointment shortly where he will most likely examin you, or you can request and examination, and he will tell you if you have dialated at all, or anything.|`|KPhmCcmgaa	I had pre-eclampsia at 36 weeks. Before i had to be induced. I felt alot of pain in my lower back area and the pain would make its way round the front area. I then found out i was 3cm dilated before being induced.

S6QpB8QZaa	My son was born when my husband was deployed to Iraq and he seen him for the first week and a half of life and then again at 3 months. He attached right to my husband at 3 months old. I wouldn't say he remembered him but he took right to him. The best thing to do is to get her used to being held by people she doesn't see often. Don't worry she will be just fine and I am sure he will want to scoop her right up and play with her which all babies love. Congrats on your new little one.|`|19hkVn1naa	no. my husband deployed to Iraq two weeks after we found out we were pregnant. my husband came home on r&r when he was 3 weeks old. when he came home for good he was 7 months old and had no clue who this man was. he cried when he held him but they will get reaquainted once they are able to spend more time together.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Probably not, she recognizes you since she was inside of you, she knows your voice and your smell - but he's been gone during the time when she would have heard his voice.   But, she will recognize the love he has for her.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	No she will not recognize her father right away.  You could help by showing her pictures of him and pictures of you and him together and say "daddy".  If he can send you a video (maybe through a cell phone or something) of him talking to her.  Keep doing stuff like that.  At this age, the only person they really respond to is mommy anyways.  I'm sure things will work out for the best.  :)  Good luck!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	no she will not recognize him after that long, but babies and kids adjust easily and after a short time with him she will learn that he is a loving gentle person she can trust and bond quickly.  a friend of mine has a one year old son and his father was in the army away for 9 months and has been home a few weeks and they are one big happy family and their son adores his dad, it took a few days but they got to know eachother quickly.|`|9EgWyiNbaa	It takes some time for babys to recognise faces but voices are really important so get daddy to record some nursery rhymes and phrases onto a cd that you can play at home or driving the car..enjoy your reunion!!|`|AA11637393	no.  At first they don't really recognize people.  Their eyesite is not good at all.  They go more by voice and smell.  They don't really recognize people until 6 months or so|`|955YoHvVaa	She might recognize his voice but not him..they tend to only recognize voices and smells for the first few months.
hEbjfeRgaa	You just described my daughter about 5 months ago when she turned 2.  I too was worried because she had a vocabulary of about 5 words.  She too also has a 4 year old brother who barely stops talking to breathe. Everyone kept telling me not to worry, wait it out, but I couldn't.  It bothered me and I was worried.  Her pediatrician was a little concerned as well and referred her for a speech evaluation where  they deemed her speech delayed and recommended therapy.  However, my insurance didn't cover the therapy.  I don't know what state your in, but the state of Ohio has an early intervention program called Help Me Grow for children up to age 3.  I contacted them and they are the only ones who didn't make me feel silly for worrying about my daughter and after their evaluation, they are providing her with an early intervention specialist and they are paying for her to receive speech therapy.  I recommend you see if something like that is available in your state and if your concerned you seek them out.  It shouldn't cost you a thing and it was a fairly easy process.  They have been wonderful and have really put my mind at ease.  After about 3 months of speech therapy my daughter is up to about 100+ words, some still not all clear and she's beginning to put 2 words together.  I know some of it is probably just her regular development, but the therapy has helped too.  She still struggles with some sounds, but with help, I'm convinced they will come.    Whew...long winded, however, I was in your shoes and can relate.  I hope this helps!|`|65RZ441Zaa	My daughter will be 2 march7th, and she seems to be at the same stage. she talks a lot, but I just can't understand everything lol. My son had a speech delay and is now in speech leassons, But My daughter is much further then he was so, I'm not worried. Some kids talk early, then rest let us live in peace for a bit longer lol I wouldn't worry, as long as she is making constant progress and she will mimic, or try to conversate :)|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I don't think there is any reason to freak out.  Having an expressive speech delay is not a big deal and is corrected rather quickly with therapy.  That is great that her receptive language skills (her understanding) is so strong.  I would have her evaluated by early intervention for a speech delay.  She should qualify, its free, you need no referral and they will begin therapy.<br>  <br>  To qualify she would need less than 50 words and not putting two words together.<br>  <br>  that is great, best thing you can do, good luck|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	They do say that every child develops at their own rate, but I would be concerned by that. Maybe it is because you have an older child who started talking very young that concerns you? That would be my reason, because my children both were early talkers, so if I had another one, and that child wasn't talking much at 2 years old, I would be very concerned.  Both of my children were using 2-3 words together by 14 months old.  My daughter won't be 2 until May, and she uses 8 word sentences and speaks about 300+ words.  I don't know... I wouldn't make a special appointment, but I would bring it up at her 2 year appointment.  Everyone says they develop at their own pace, and I guess I would have to believe it since I see children who are 4-5 years old that my daughter talks better than.  I have an almost 3 year old son whom everything thinks is 6 years old by the way he talks..... so maybe your concern is just coming from seeing how your older child was, and it is impossible to compare children.  I dunno, sorry so long and may not make sense, but bottom line, I would say she is fine and developing normal, but I personally would just make a comment of it to your doctor at her 2 year appointment.|`|1572d0d1be8220d81d09076155c61b80aa	well, i dont think i would be too concerned, to me it sounds like you have a very smart almost 2 year old, my daughter just turned two and she has a very high vocabulary, but i have noticed something, my daughter also loves to watch tv, and she learned most of her words from cartoons, lol and other friends of mine who have two year olds their kids dont like to watch tv, and they dont say that many words, like maybe 12 words total. i think that kids have to be interested in something, to teach them the words,<br>  <br>  like as u said she says momma and daddy, and ur cats name, she is interested in all of those things, and hears them on a daily basis, just work with her, and maybe try books, or teaching movies for kids. im sure she will raise her vocabulary in no time. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|bAY9j21Paa	well its true that that develope at different rates.... my two oldest started talking very Early, then i am now babysitting a little girl who is 17 months old and she really doesnt say much at all, ive heard her maybe say only 5 words in the last two weeks, so it really just depends on the child. Do you work with her alot? Ive always been a stay at home mom and really worked with my children a lot, enunciating almost everything we see or touch or eat. Even in the last week of babysitting this little girl, ive managed to teach her a new word, so i really think it just depends on how much time you have to dedicate to the child maybe. i wouldnt worry , just work with her ALOT.  My youngest, 7 month old, she still is not turning over onto her belly or back, she did it once but never again since.. it had me concerned but she really rarely gets any tummy time, and thats my fault, so i would just say practice practice practice! best of luck!|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Every child does develop at their own rate.  My second child didn't talk either. I was beginning to get concerned and then all of the sudden only months before he turned 3 he started talking....and didn't stop!  He talks and talks and talks now without stopping!<br>  <br>  If you are truely concerned talk to your doctor about it, he can tell you if all is well or if there is reason to be concerned. The fact that she understands is a big deal, it sounds to me like there is no problem.|`|ygbhsZ2Zaa	If you really want to, you can have her hearing checked, but it really isn't that worrisone since she *is*, technically, talking- and also by what's she's saying, hearing and comprehending things around her.<br>  My just turned 11 year old started "really" talking around 2 1/2- we cannot get the girl to stop now.<br>  My 22 month old is about where yours is, but clearly understands three languages (only because we have a trilingual home). People *constantly* come up to us in stores- you know the whole "what's your name" "how old are you"  "aren't you pretty" gig- and then look at me strangely when she doesn't answer. It could give you a complex, I know. But it's a variation of normal. She finds other ways of communicating very well.<br>  My 7 month old, on the other hand, will echo anything andI suspect will be a very early talker- but that doesn't mean an awful lot in the long run.<br>  From my chldren, I've learned that no matter when they do something, they will, eventually, do it.
um29wkUPaa	I keep (most) pots, pans, every-day dishes, cups/mugs and utensils all within my reach (I'm short).  Higher cabinets I use for good dishes, pots that I don't use very much (my crock pot for example, or a third frying pan, etc.).<br>  <br>  Tupperware, funny you asked that I just posted something about that... I'm at the end of my rope.  I've tried everything and I still lose one half of every container.  Although there's a real possibility they're full of legos or pet shop puppies and that's why I can only find the lids.  <br>  <br>  Corningware and casserole dishes I don't have OUT of reach, but not at my fingertips either.  I use it at least once a week, but not every day.  So I put it in the wall-hutch where it's not unaccessible, but I'm not tripping over it when I don't need it.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	First thing to do would be de-clutter.  The rule generally is, if you haven't used it in 6 months, you don't need it.  (But you can use a one year rule for birthday/holiday items.)  Also...clearing off counter space helps.  Things like keys, mail, phonebooks, etc. *usually* have a more appropriate place in the home.  I keep a knife block and a microwave on my counter and that is it.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say about your kitchen without seeing it.  I keep daily use items where I can access them easily.  Appliances are stored away.  I did go ahead and purchase a wire shelf to place in the cupboard so that I can stack different sized bowls.  I also installed a pull out shelf (on a wheel track) inside a large bottom cabinet so that I can place my pyrex dishes (which I use EVERY day in cooking,) on top...roll out and I can easily grap what I need.  I also use a lot of baskets in drawers to seperate silverware and all those other random little things you collect.  I do not own a lazy susan.  My grandmother has about three and they work for her, but they drive me insane.  Instead, I have a decorative spice rack which not only holds that...it also keeps my few cook books in place.  I keep cleaning supplies and trashbags only under my sink.  I don't like the idea of chemicals being near any cooking supplies.  Again though, I stress decluttering.  If I haven't used it...I donate or trash it.|`|AA12086491	I like using open shelves to store anything I need to easily reach that I use a lot.  Lazy Susan's are good for storing foods you don't use much, for example baking supplies.  Under the sink I use stackable drawers that hold tin foil and garbage bag rolls, anything that applies to the maintenence.  For organization I find its best to keep everything that is used in the kitchen in the kitchen and everything thats not out of it.  I only say this because for a while my family kept their cleaning supplies all in one place but if a certain kind of trash bags are only used in the kitchen it only makes sense that you would keep them there.  It also really depends on your layout to decide how you can store things.  Decide what is the function of your kitchen, is it just for cooking, for gathering, hw area, etc.  If you have that much you need to store, maybe you aren't using all of your items, in which case you could get rid of them and borrow you applesauce making equiptment from a friend when you make it once a year.  Just an example|`|AkFag8tNaa	Anything you use on a daily basis, should be kept at eye level (most accessible). Try putting dishes together that you use together (mixing bowls w/baking pans etc....). I only use my sink for dish/cleaning supplies and plastic bags/trash bags. Anything that is seasonal (seasonal dishes, birthday cake pans etc...) should go in the garage if you have one.
5axGfFofaa	I have my hopes up too!  My period was Feb 4 and my monitor gave me "peak" fertility on Fri.  We BD'd Thur and Fri so I am really hoping.  We have had 2 m/c's and we want our baby soooo bad!!!  I am already analyzing every twitch even though I know that would be impossible b/c I would on only be 2-3 DPO ( I dont know if you count from LH surge or the day after???)<br>  Good luck to you!!!  Keep me posted on your success!
oiJITSNZaa	no stop trying to make a negative a positive! it won't make you pg!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It could mean something but I would recommend taking another pregnancy test tomorrow morning or in a week and see what it says. Good luck!|`|yea2hci5aa	If you're unsure then I would wait 3 more days and take another test.  If you are pregnant then maybe there's not enough hcg in your urine for the test to read.  Either that or you can make an appointment with your doctor to get a blood test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HdAuji6eaa	I will test again and clear all doubts. <br>  <br>  Try the Home pregnancy test.

zCWFy3Nvaa	From my experience(current) the only thing that helps me even get up after a long night sleep is sleeping on my side with just a shirt and about 2 or 3 folded pillows in between my legs.As long as both your legs are parallel(or close enough) then you be putting the same amount of weight on both sides of your hips.I have terrible pelvic pain in the morning when I opt from doin this.I cant even walk sometimes,but this deffinately helps alot! You've probably heard the pillow thing already but it didnt work for me until I put 3 folded billows between my legs.I hope it helps ( :.<br>  <br>   p.s<br>    I only sleep with a t shirt because whenever i feel asleep with sleeping pants the waistband would dig in to my sides and leave marks that would later start itching.A nice loose shirt or a silk gown for easier maneuvering is always good!|`|R1jgGJ0Naa	Pop demm vicodenn|`|hCvEbRYWaa	oh wow! I would love to know the answer to this question. I'm having the exact same problem as you and i'm also 33 weeks pregnant.
PTdy6TWRaa	When he goes in his pants make sure he helps clean up his mess, dumps it in the toilet, rinses out his pants and then washes up thoroughly. Stand over him to make sure he's cleaning up properly but keep conversation to a minimum so that he won't perpetuate the behavior for the attention he gets from it. Just make it his chore and you be there to supervise it.<br>  <br>  When he realizes that he is making more work for himself, that the clean up is no fun, and that it would be so much easier to go in the toilet he'll start to go there. Give him lots of praise when he does.
czmCJRe6aa	My dh was away for over 6 months when my son was 6-12months and it was like he never left!  We were surprised!  <br>  <br>  Don't worry- it will be  a wonderful reunion!|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i hope so for both of our sakes. I am about to leave my 1 year old for about a month or so while i move out of state. i'm leaving my son with my parents until i get a job and a place. So i am going to say yes|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Oh bless you, it must be really hard to be away from baby for that long!<br>  <br>  But of course she will remember you.|`|XfGOFc5saa	Yes!!!! your baby will definately recognise you. It's had 11 months to get to know you. I left my baby at about 8 months with her grandparents and she didn't forget me although i did get the cold shoulder for a few weeks and daddy was definately in favour!|`|PC4Qul9Gaa	Don't worry you're baby will recognize you..|`|N6vEZVNEaa	yes of course your baby will....baby's always know there parents and your baby is 11 months so he knows you well
uFrqC4Y2aa	That didn't happen for me. I've never heard of that happening so early either.|`|Twvbu4fxaa	U mean that there is milk from ur breasts? that doesnt happen I think at this stage ! But a feeling of sour breasts and a little bit bigger is just normal because they r getting ready to produce milk. But milking starts just near birth i think. U better ask ur doctor...call him if u dont see him.|`|u7Cm4abAaa	It's totally normal esp since it's not your first.  Like your belly showing sooner, etc.  Your body is just preparing itself.  Mine started at +/- 3 months and I am on my first baby (28 weeks).  No worries and good luck.
uFrqC4Y2aa	I wouldn't think so since you are continuing to have your period.|`|jiTKnCKpaa	You could be, I had LLETZ (same sort of procedure) in October 2008 had my period November and then light bleeding for 2 days in December I assumed it was because of the LLETZ but I was actually 4 weeks pregnant I didn't find out till Jan when I missed my period and was having symptoms and was 9 weeks pregnant. So yes you could be, you could take a test but it may be to early to tell I would wait until your period is due and if you miss it or its lighter then take a test.|`|FJlCys0Gaa	I hate to point out the obvious but have you thought about taking a pregnancy test.  They usually tell you the answer.  With that you need to go see a doctor.<br>  1, If you are pregnant you will need pre natal examinations<br>  <br>  2, If your not there may be another medical reason for the change to your bleeds.<br>  <br>  x
XPnCeJ29aa	She would not be watching my kids anymore.|`|DDFSITiYaa	You definitely need to confront her on this and I personally would not feel comfortable having my kids around someone who is lying all the time.  Call her back and say, what time were you at the house?  Uh huh, uh, huh, guess what - I am home today and have been here all morning.  Where are you with my children?|`|NLf99NuWaa	I would sit down with her explain you know she is not being truthful and fire her! That is Not ok, you can't have somebody like that taking care of your children. Find a new nanny, sorry!|`|e60hNP76aa	Get a new nanny RIGHT AWAY!   You need someone that will be honest with you.  You can't take chances with the person that looks after your children.  Needless to say she won't get a good reference for her next job from you!|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Start looking for a new nanny.  The last thing you need is a liar around your most prized possessions.|`|ESWdyM6Haa	"This is not the first time...?" There is only ONE response and you should have already made it: TERMINATION!|`|M2yERqNSaa	get your lazy *** out of bed and take care of your own kids<br>  <br>  if youre sick what are you doing online, what should we do about you lying ?|`|lGrcLQ49aa	If she is lying about this what else is she lying about.  In my life experience I have found the lying is usually just the beginning.  If she is comfortable lying then she is comfortable doing other things - and these are not just little white lies she is telling.  I would fire her right now, no questions asked.  I am curious, did you call her out on the lie yet?|`|VwMkiLFPaa	If I have ANY shred of doubt in the person who is caring for my child, I’d call them on it but most likely wouldn’t allow them to watch my kids anymore. I'd be interested to hear her response and I'd still give her the benefit of the doubt. BUT....<br>  <br>  If she can lie about something as petty as this, what else could she be lying about?<br>  <br>  My kids come first so I’d be finding myself new care!|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I would fire her. Justified or not, you're the parent and it's your duty to act on gut feelings to protect your kids, and she can't be trusted.<br>  <br>  I would explain to her that I felt uneasy about her conflicting stories regarding what I'VE SEEN to not be true. I would reassure her that I wasn't accusing her of anything and let her know that I wouldn't be able to provide a positive reference for her and wish her luck. I don't take chances with my kids so anyone that was lying about anything in my presence- whether regarding the kids or not- would prove untrustworthy.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Mmm sounds dodgy to me. I wouldn't like a fibbing nanny. Lying is not a good quality in anyone, let alone the person responsible for your children. My advice would be to find a new one. You don't want to have to worry more than normal about your children. And it sounds like she's lying because she's work shy and can't be bothered; so what else is she being slack about??|`|bkOn30I1aa	I think it is time you get yourself a new nanny!! Some one that is not honest about the little things, will not be honest about the big things either. Who knows what else she is lying about; I would definitely look for someone else as soon as possible. Good luck!|`|AkFag8tNaa	Someone that is taking care of your children should be honest. It's just bizarre that she would make up being locked out of your house or that the kids are sick......get someone else.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i would change your nanny. apparently she is not trust worthy and if she is lying about this kind of stuff you either need to confront her and tell her that you KNOW she is lying and that it needs to stop or she will loose her job.i personally wouldn't tolerate such behavior. sounds to me like she is making things up in order to get out of doing what she is supposed to be doing. not only is that bad judgment but it teaches your children that lying is ok and she is setting a VERY bad example. you really need to do something about this... especially if she is lying about this kind of stuff it would lead me to wonder what else she is lying about. that's scary
ViR6BXiyaa	Surely it just means you had your LH Surge on the day you tested.  I had a positive test on Saturday, it was negative Friday and yesterday, but I know that I have ovulated as I have had some bad abdo pains which are still there!  Im not sure if you can get a false positive.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	u ovulated the day it was positive. positive stays only when there is LH surge and when its over the positive fades away. Best of luck :)|`|H3Va1OKqaa	considering you have 2/3 negatives, it's most likely a false positive. <br>  Your writing is very confusing.|`|wNNmj1sQaa	if you mean that you got a negative opk on the first day, then a positive the second day and then a negative the third day then this is normal.  The LH surge that the opk detects does not last for long.|`|oiJITSNZaa	most likely not
AFxOZ0Hxaa	Hard to say. Could be implantation cramps! Or could be the dreaded AF cramps coming. It's so hard because the symtoms are apparently so similar. Good luck & baby dust!|`|GEfpzUNvaa	haha thas a good question.. i just asked a similar one too.. lol  anyway yeah ive been having lots of discharge down there havet ovulated yet though.. so you got be on both questions.. but good luck sorry
BUOJJpaCaa	I'm sorry you're hurt.<br>  <br>  Guys are emotional voids at a certain age. I think he does like you but maybe he's in an on-again/off-again relationship (hence the it's complicated status on facebook).<br>  <br>  Maybe, in his mind, he thinks distancing himself from you will save you from hurt.|`|FERfSYtzaa	well he is afraid of being hurt, because you don't know how his last relationship was|`|AA11390428	Well there is always such guys.   guys in such an age are tend to be so.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	That's life, and that's guys for you.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Tell her to get on Medicaid. At least this way she will have good coverage. She needs to tell her parents though. If she expects them to be the providers they need to know.|`|QSodlfMraa	if she dont care, all hope is lost, but try your best because she really should not be smoking.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	Prenatal vitamins are vital to start right away!<br>  <br>  free clinics or medicaid can help her with the insurance part of her pregnancy. <br>  <br>  if she cared, she wouldnt make up excuses.|`|SIp415MFaa	my advice is to sit down an tell her of your concerns and encourage her to talk to her mother. Offer to sit with her when she tells her parents as she will need the support because her parents will be disappointed there is no denying it but they may be understanding and find a way to help.|`|qDYdSSvIaa	Get as much resource as you can maybe is one  option,however it could be quite time consuming,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is one resource i have had good experience.|`|MAABo1zKaa	they have free clinics and doctors for pregnant women. look them up online. and its her baby, her responsibility.|`|94kNwMPdaa	well you need to sit her down and tell her that she either needs to tell her mom now or your going to do it for her. <br>  <br>  as for the prenatal vitamins. for now until she gets some perscribed from the doctor if she does. idk if she will because my friend when she was pregnant the doctors had her get any type of vitamins she wanted. so you could go to the store and get vitamins for her to take. My friend takes gummy vitamins their pretty good especially if you have a hard time swallowing.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Tell her there are programs out there to help her. Medicade is one of them. They will pay 100% of all medical for her and the baby. If she goes and fills out the application at your local welfare office they will cover up to 3 months prior. She needs to get on prenatal vitamins! They are cheap and are a must have. They are the key thing to her child's eye and brain development. As for telling her mom, give her time. It is a hard thing. I was married and it still took me 3 months to tell mine. The mother will be mad at first but as soon as she see's her grandchild that will probably change.  She should think about getting a job. How does she expect to buy diapers? They don't just hand these things out. But I think your job as a best friend is to support her emotionally and urge her to get her head on straight and start thinking of her child. Things are no longer about her. Where is the father through all of this?
AA12202431	Since the blood test is accurate at 11 days, I would say so should the HPT's.|`|xpstigPTaa	You can take some of the test 5 days prior to your period but honestly, they are no where near as accurate as if you take one AFTER you have missed your period. I took one 4 days before my missed period and it was negative. Then I took one the day after my missed period and it was positive! So if you want the most accurate answer, I would wait until you have missed your period. Best of luck and lots of baby dust!|`|XyRzSzjtaa	i wud wait a few days after ur period|`|IcYhv7gRaa	I was told as early as 3-4 days before an expected period. But just the other day my s-in-law told me that she took one at 4 weeks but it ont show up until 6weeks. It just depends on how strong the pregnancy hormones are.|`|aJTBF7opaa	The earliest is 5 days befor your missed period, with an early detection test. Hormones will not show up befor then, and if ur hormones are still to low to detect it could be a few days more.|`|jQnxo57yaa	You can take a test up to a 5 days before your missed period...however the longer you wait the better chance the test will be acurate.
