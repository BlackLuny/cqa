87pV5lvZaa	I am a school teacher myself, and I think it is ABSURD that a teacher would tell you to ask this question to complete strangers.  I am praying that you are in college (not high school), because, if you are in high school, then your teacher is probably breaking the law by giving you this assignment.  Imagine what could happen if you asked the wrong type of person--say, a registered sex offender--this question!  I am so glad that you are intelligent enough to ask this question over an internet forum rather than in person.  If you are in high school, then you need to tell a counselor or an administrator about this assignment.  The school should not allow this due to the danger it could cause.|`|8OVEjPg1aa	Here's what I would do:    Step 1(optional). Ask your teacher these questions... you may not want to know, but it may embarrass them.    Step 2. Don't finish the homework.    Step 3. If you insist on 'doing the homework'. Make up answers.

f7b078d612914272a07e0d29ca1d7c5daa	you dont get worms from eating too many sweets you get them from being in contact with people with them. Yes Its true. They thrive when you eat a lot of sugary things sopposedly the most common would be thred worms and how you know you have them is your butt would be itcy at bed time as this is when they come out yes COME OUT to lay there eggs at your hole :) nice.  you would also see them in ur poop as little white wriggly things like .....hread hence thread worms.  to treat them you need to get the medication from the pharacist and treat the entire house hold as they are extremely contagous.  also strict hygiene must be adhered i.e. changing of hand towels bed linen etc.  the dose must be repeated 6 weeks later as that is when leftover eggs can hatch inside and then the cycle will start again. Its actually quite common Gross but common|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	yes it is true ..  there called round worms .. you have to go to the doctor to get medicine to kill them ..|`|AA11895447	Yes, they are called pinworms. They won't go away on their own, and you definately know when you have them. Your anus (not buthold please be mature about it), will be very incredibly itchy, and it will hurt to pass stool. You need to go to the doctor and get antibiotics to treat it.|`|8pTML1F9aa	U pull the them out O_o

As long as I do productive things its not as bad, however if you are just bumming around and eating then thats the problem.

You can always exercise at home.
Br9Ze4EGaa	If you're 5'10" and 124 pounds, you're underweight...    Also, you're 14 and still maturing, yes, cup size does depend partially on weight considering they're composed of fat, but they're also composed of breast tissue.     You'll have to wait it out, not everyone get's large ones, regardless of heredity. My mum has double D's and I'm almost 17 and still at a 36A, close to a B, but I don't mind it so much because shirts fit a lot more nicely. :)|`|CGUUBVeEaa	It depends! Unfortunately no-one will be able to predict this for you. You are tall for your age, and are a fairly low weight. It is true that gaining weight can cause some people's boobs to grow, but everyone puts on and loses weight from different places. You probably have a good five years of growth left in you - give it time! Breast size can run in the family (not always, but sometimes), so if your mum and maternal grandma are fairly small chested, then maybe you can expect that too. It doesn't matter what size your chest is - by the sound of it you can pull off most clothing styles which many people would kill for!|`|AA11895447	Don't listen to them! When I was 14 I didn't even have to wear a bra, my breasts were that small. I was just a late developer, and sounds like you may be one too. I didn't have bigger breasts until I was 19, when they started growing more quickly, and I'm a 34C now. So be patient, you're still young, your breasts can still develop well into your 20's. And so what if you have an A cup forever? In reality most guys actually prefer smaller, perkier breasts!!!|`|BI8c6XXPaa	No no no no.     I thought I would be a size B forever, but after I turned 21 I went to D cup. Your boobs keep growing. Don't gain weight, they will grow steadily as the years go on. Having kids makes your boobs bigger too. Do pushups, that will help increase your breast size a little.    Your friends are probably jealous and are trying to get you to gain weight because you're skinnier than them. Don't worry about it.|`|2Nznp6BSaa	Their lying, your probably just late getting boobs and they'll come. It all depends on the girl and her family history. Mine are 36 B's and i'm 13. My family has big boobs. You will get boobs.|`|xk5XK6CPaa	No its not true.        Your boobs will get as big as ur moms atleast... its all genitics ur prob just a late bloomer. You cld get bigger just not as quick as everyone else.|`|3YJRqFGJaa	that not tru|`|4qya6PXzaa	No they are lieing ur wieght has nothing to do w/ the growth of your BOOBS|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	maybe if u try and eat different kinda foods... but i dont really think that u can change their size ... unless u wanna try surgery *sp* ^^" srry but i hope this helps...|`|ijpU8jSCaa	well sometimess .  boobs are just fatty tissue .  im skinnyishh , and i have a ratherr bigger chest .|`|emJ79qagaa	dont gain weight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy being healthy. You can do a lot of things to make them look bigger like push up bras!|`|0d4885127f2e8efc746aee0382752eb5aa	Even though u do grow if you gain weight (women gain primarily in their breasts) breast size depends on heredity.  So depending on how big your mom, grandma and aunts are...that should give u an idea of how big you might get.
oyDoFevFaa	Hi hun,        Well this is simply, a personal choice. Many women choose to shave there and yes it can keep it cleaner. Some so prefer the natural feel and both are fine, just personal choice.    In many ways, having the vagina shaved/waxed can make it feel cleaner and less likely to keep any bacteria on the surface, than it would of there was hair there.    So, whichever you feel most comfortable with!    xxx|`|KeDY8hNvaa	shaving is a lot cleaner, but it's a personal choice|`|BI8c6XXPaa	Actually, back in the day before a woman was about to give birth, the doctor would shave the area because they thought it would be cleaner that way. The hair holds more bacteria, but now they are saying that shaving can cause little cuts in the skin which are also breeding grounds for bacteria. So, they say it is equally clean either way.    Today most doctors agree it is a personal choice. Most don't even shave their patients anymore unless they need to for surgery. I prefer shaved because that way it is out of my way, doesn't itch and doesn't stick to my maxi pad on the sticky part.|`|sDFvKKRlaa	good to shave. be careful, you dont want to do it too often because you might get bumps with the razor. another tip, i like using my hubbys shaving cream because it leaves it smooth. i dont trust just soap or the regular stuff to shave.|`|11d28a719b061143141cbe5fe883288caa	shaved is cleaner but its up to u|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	shaved is better|`|3YJRqFGJaa	its ur choice i dont think ones healthier its just ur preference|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	It doesn't have to do with cleanliness. Girls only shave there because some men don't like to preform oral sex on a hairy one. Other people who do that are horny pornstars.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	it's better to shave down there. that way, you dont get ingrown hairs and other stuff.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	healthy? Either way I dont think you can call it healthy. there is nothing that will make you healthy for having or not hair.  you can trim it a little if someone have more hair than usual. And shave it mmm.... If you have time to take care of it do it. bacuse as the hair grows your partener can hurt. or you can itch! haha.....  Why dont you try shaving and if you like it keep it or waxing too.  or cut some hair it will do the trick.   either way its goin to be clean. it only depend on how clean you are.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Shaving is not "healthy" technically.    They used to shave women for birth, but now they don't.  Why?  Because the hair is actually a barrier to vaginal infections, and worse.     I've done this, but in a few days got ingrown hairs, and reddish bumps.    Then i tried a special depilatory...made for the job.  OMG...the burn was awful.  I used a timer, and had to remove the stuff after only three minutes. After I could not walk for three days.    I also noticed I tend to get yeast infections after a shave.    If you want to be healthy, trim, but don't shave.    When men start shaving their parts, I'll think about it again.|`|BhYDTUrWaa	shave it's better   it is un sexy to have a hairy crotch  and it looks better and cleaner
64qFLAw2aa	If you have a planner or calender you can just put a little red dot 28 days from when you last started. It doesnt work well for me because i mine are very inconsistent, but if yours are regular it should work well|`|N0fCDn33aa	Well, I'd start at 1.  Then, when I'm ready, I'd start thinking about moving on to 2.  I'd follow that up quickly by 3, moving on shortly after that to 4.  5 would quickly be added to the mix, after which I would consider involving 6 in the situation.   7 would, no doubt, be keen to jump in, but not without his buddy 8.   I would have no choice, at this point, but to move on to 9, at which point it would be useless not to crank it on up to 10.  11, it seems, would be the next logical step, with 12 providing a satisfyingly constant progression.   I would choose 13 reluctantly, if not only because it is necessary in order to reach 14.   And 15 would follow leading to an inevitable meeting with 16.   At this point I would rest before considering a thrust of sorts, arriving at 17, then 18, then 19 in quick succession.  20 would be my next choice, although the next decision, 21, would add some variety to the mix.    I would then continue towards 24 but not before stopping off at 23.  "25", I would scream with an enthusiasm matched only by my cry of "26"!  My energy depleted I would mutter 27 as I rummaged through my brain thinking what could come next, I would decide on 28.  29 would follow as a nice surprise leading on to the obvious choice, 30.  I would then think 31 a fitting place to end.    You're welcome.|`|US0l3MZWaa	1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,
cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	Those are really hard to get rid of. Your best option is to actually moisturize the skin and exfoliate as much as you can. The combination of the two will soften up the scar tissue and slowly wear it away replacing it with fresh new skin as time goes by.

8OVEjPg1aa	I had this problem too. I would literally have to roll out of bed. But once I was up I would be fine.     I started to use my cell phone to wake up instead of the annoying beeping. It's a rock ring tone, so it startles me awake. I change it sometimes so I won't get used to it and ignore it.    Also, put your alarm away from your reach. Having to get out of bed to turn it off helps.     I also started showering in the mornings instead of the night before. The water really wakes me up. Just make sure you dry your hair well. If you don't want to shower in the morning, just wash your face.     Try doing some sort of activity if you feel like it helps. For instance, stretching or dancing wildly for a few seconds. My sister seems to think it helps her if she sings at the top of her lungs in the morning.    Hope some of these will help you! Good luck!|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Same here.  I also wake up at 6am and don't end up going to bed at night until around 11 or 11:30.  I like to shower at night so I stretch in bed, use my cell phone to wake me and wash my face right when I get out of bed.  I've also heard that you should keep your same schedule so if you keep waking up early on the weekends then it'll be easier during the week to wake up.  But, that never happens for me.  I love to take advantage of that extra sleep on the weekends.|`|cfmI2wmQaa	1. get to sleep early.   2. keep a bottle of water next to your bed and drink it when your alarm goes off.   3. set an automatic timer on your coffee pot so your coffee is ready when you get out of bed.   4. eat something light but with a bit of sugar i.e. yogurt w/ fruit and honey for breakfast.    Hope it helps.

However, considering your age and the location of the lump you are describing, it's very unlikely that what you are feeling is a tumor.

ouyYOaPWaa	I'm dealing with the same exact **** as you. I just bare it and suck it up and deal with my panic attacks, and try to think as poistive. It's weird because if you THINK about having anxiety you have it, but if you don't think about it.. you'rew not going to get it. It's like we set ourselves up to have panic attacks, we say or think about the panic and we have it. If we kept our mind clear we;d be okay.. but for some reason without treatment we can't do that. I'm currently on Prozac for Generalized Anxiety and Panic disorder. What meds have you been on?|`|iybezfi6aa	You are already handling it.

Try to stay off meds as long as you can. It worsens it after you get off them, even if takes you a while to get the symptoms. Listen to soft, music, no hyper, rock or rap. Honestly, I've had really bad anxiety attacks and what helps the most is the breathing exercises along with physical exercises. It helps you release all of it. Also, avoid drinking caffeinated drinks, or smoking, or using drugs (no offense if you don't use but just in case) because they can cause you to have withdrawal symptoms which can induce anxiety.    Peace, my friend.
1CVOHoapaa	Go on Britain/Americas got talent. A clicking elbow should at least get you th the quarter finals...|`|g7M1DxFCaa	There are about 200 different types of arthritis, I suffer from it but to be honest I don't usually suffer that much.  Most of my joints do that, most of the time but they can be painful if I spend much time in cold and/or damp conditions.  I still get about ok at 38.  Although things are gradually getting worse, 'gradually' is the word here because this started when I was 12 in my knees and that was 26 years ago.  You should probably see your doctor about this.  Exposure to bad weather, cold and damp living conditions and excessive strain are to be avoided.  Cod liver oil although maybe not the most pleasant substance is really quite effective with joint difficulties, the oil gets secreted in the joints which helps prevent wear.  You could think of it as similar to a truck's automatic chassis lubrication system - or maybe I just see it like that because I'm a mechanic?|`|AA12269056	dear joanne,   most of the time when joints make noise , it is of no consequence.  however, if there is an increase in  noise   or pain becomes associated with it, it is time to see a doctor...good health to you , and i am very glad that you do not smoke !|`|8H830N8iaa	its just clicking against your joint, happens to everyone.|`|q9yxSPpUaa	yup its tottaly your bone prob. i happened to me i had experece i always stretch and thats what made it better. so always stretch and sleep right thx for not smoking and being a good person do not think about smoking that cause lung cancer which it can make you die but its not contagus|`|e43hjVI6aa	It's popping, drama queen.|`|ia1SMuRraa	its probably cause you're old jk.

Talk to you doctor for excerises to tighten the muscles in these areas so they don't slip out of place.  Also visit a chiropractor for an adjustment. Don't ignor this concern , it will get worse and possibily need surgery many years later ( like when you are 50 or older )  if you leave the clicking unchecked.
3Y2jRkxcaa	If you are talking about sex then you normally ask your parents. But since this is the internet I will tell you. Boys have a penis and girls have a vagina.

You are well on your way to alcoholism. Oh don't listen to me, mate, its only the fact that you are at the age statistically that most alcoholics are already in trouble. Teenage binge drinking is a highly reliable indication of future addiction.    Don't worry about quitting though, its damn easy for most drunks. 9 out of 10 alcoholics quit drinking just before their caskets are lowered into the grave.    Boy, get some help with this while you still have some childhood left. Be the one in ten, if not for yourself then for your freinds and family.|`|nQW1MSMpaa	At your age you should be having no more than one beer. My parents would let me have a glass of beer, on occasion, at your age, so that it held no allure for us kids and we didn't do what you are now doing. Because we got to try beer and wine at the dinner table with our parents it was not a taboo thing, something that we had to try to do behind their backs.    I think many kids do these things because it is something that their parents would be upset at them doing.    Please think about what you are doing, because heavy drinking destroys your brain cells, and when you are only 15 your brain still hasn't finished developing. The occasional single drink here or there doesn't really matter, but binge drinking (what you are doing) is extremely detrimental to your health.|`|g4lLX3iaaa	THOU SHALT NOT DRINK.THOU SHALT NOT.............hmm NOT  em NOT  er,DO ANYTHING THAT YOU WILL ENJOY.Jeez,I'm tired now,think I'll have another  Vodka and tonic|`|sTCn0FqOaa	A. at 15 your to young to be legally drinking  B. depends on what country you live in, in the US minimum age is 21, In Australia where men are men its 18.

The effects your feeling is you getting drunk, not a good thing  G. if you are going to try it, remember it is illegal and at your age specifically is having a negative effect on your  health, brain cell development, liver function(you only have one liver and when its buggered so are you) and reproductive organs (uh oh, bad **** for a 15 year old)  E. restrict yourself to a schooner (15oz) of beer in the 1st hour and middy (10oz) an hour after that don't have more than 3  F. Finally, ITS ILLEGAL, ITS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT, IT WILL KILL YOU!!!!|`|sPZW8Bcyaa	15 is kind of young to drink alcohol, because of this you actually should listen to these old farts that say not to drink before 21. Wait until you're more mature and responsible, I didn't have my first sip till 17. I think 17 and 18 is fine because everywhere else in the world allows it at 18 or younger, america is just different and full of idiots so we need a way to control them. Don't make it your priority to drink, there's other fun things you can be doing at 15.|`|QltS6mUEaa	Anything because you are to young to drink alcohol.  The drinking age is 21.
mEKiFQtZaa	Align is a trade name for a certain bacteria that helps promote digestion and enforce your body's normal flora(healthy bacteria).  Which absorbs the nutrients, and breaks down food. Anything that will help your intestines process food will reduce the amount of chance that  food will get pushed into the little pockets in your intestines  and cause an infection(diverticulitis). A bulk former will also help, something like metamucil. But eating whole grain foods and increasing your daily water intake will also help. As far as the abdominal  pain goes. You should probably go see your primary care physician. This may or may not have anything to do with your diverticulitis.

hmAA75lnaa	Take flaxseed oil and get a scrub for your face. It works.|`|QdbKtBHwaa	If possible, see a dermatologist. There you can either be prescribed with medication, or you can ask about products to use that are over the counter. I had bad acne before on my face chest and back. Now I am completely clear. You must wash your face with something gentle  (clearasil daily wash) every night and morning. And don't pop pimples! they will just come back. When drying your face pat it, or else acne will get irritated. Try oxy clean medicated wipes. The doctor prescribed me with retin a and duac topical gel. Worked like a charm. only 5 dollars with insurance. Don't touch your face. It took my face about 4-5 months, so give it a try. Hope this helped.|`|K9SmiHX6aa	nope it sucks|`|jJjW9hx7aa	wash it every morning and every night with soapy water, and also use face cleaner every time you take a bath or shower.

If you have that, you need to see a doctor and talk about getting on serious stuff like acutane, which is dangerous but totally worked for my friend.. her skins like perfect now.    if its red and it you can pop it (ew, but you get what i mean) it might be easier to solve.    I have that kind, I get it hardcore on my chin and under my nose and on my forehead (T zone).  I got on proactive last year and I have to say, it does work.  I feel like another proactive zombie but it really has made my skin a lot clearer.. not 100 percent, but better.    There's a good chance your acne is stress related, as is mine.  What worked for me: I go to bed earlier!  Try going to bed at like 10.  You'll see a pretty quick improvement.  If that doesn't work, try drinking a lot more water to wash the toxins out of your body.  But, whatever you do, definitely get on a regular acne-control program. Don't ignore it, it could scar.|`|boqA50Fgaa	Well my friend gets pimples on her ace but she doesn't have acne. She washs her face and than puts tooth paste on the pimple, and it goes away like fast. I think it depends on how much yu have. Try to drink alot of water and go talk to your docter they usually prescribe a cream. Don't eat alot of chocolate. Hope it helped!|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	A little sun can help clear your face up. If you can try tanning once or twice a week. Or more if you so desire. Also I have odd skin and to much scrubbing makes things worse. What I use is a mint julep mask every few days. In between I wash my face with my body wash in the shower and that helps a lot. The proactive stuff really does work too.
98efbe3dfc34c68b7f5cc8d76ea17619aa	As a general rule, when you use one arm, it isolates the muscle groups, hence, more resistance. When you curl both arms at a time, the resistance is less because both arms are taking the load.  If you really want to work on your biceps, the quickest results are using dumbells on a preacher bench, one arm at a time or alternating right and left. git er' done!|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Well one arm at a time... or both.... you should always mix it up... e.g. I also use the preacher curl bench, sometimes one arm at a time, sometimes both... seated dumbell curls one arm at a time, sometimes with a barbell, standing curls same again, cable machine both arms but sometimes reverse grip.    The variety helps growth I think... also in a busy gym it pays to have diverse options.. that machine may not be available when you want it.|`|f7PlvV4Baa	dont use a machine for bicep curls, seriously. just use dumb bells for the biceps|`|Q5Xj3XOlaa	do it one at a time|`|nIo6eOz0aa	One or two handed shouldn't make much difference as it will just be the maximum amount of weight you can lift.    But personally i wouldn't use any resistance machine to work out unless absolutely necessary, for biceps an easy-curl bar (like a straight bar but has a couple of bends in it) is probably the best. It can be loaded up with a custom weight and used in an over/unhand grip and a close/wide grip - which are all needed for all round and sculpted biceps.    But if you do use a bicep resistance machine and its not feeling right make sure its setup to the correct high etc.    NB: If you do use a bar or dumbbells try to minimize the amount rock forward and backwards as you do your reps/sets.

BI8c6XXPaa	It looks kind of like a turkey baster, lol. It is filled with warm saline water and they stick it up your rectum, gently of course, it doesn't hurt. Then the water will soak into your poo and make it easier to go. Lol you won't have to wear a diaper, but a pad would be a good idea in case it seeps out, you don't want to ruin your underwear. It will just be uncomfortable and then you will be over it. Its nothing to worry about.|`|e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	A enema is kind of like douching. It is for the rectum though. You just have to relax so that it wont be too uncomfortable when it gets inserted into your anus. If you are getting a high enema, which means they are going in deeper, then you may have to wear one for a day just to ensure that nothing else comes out. Sometimes, a little water gets trapped in there and may come out if you pass gas, have a bowel movement or do nothing at all. Most of the time, nothing else comes out.   I have never needed a diaper or pad.    You just have to relax. If you want to practice, put your finger back there, not in there and see what you have to do to loosen it up. I know it sounds gross but it will make you more comfy with what you must do when you get it. If you have been constipated for a week, you can try a laxative tea with Senna in it. It makes you go. The best one is Smooth Moves by Traditional medicines.     Good luck
G7RCYINQaa	sounds like you have hit your toe hard enough to make blood come to the skin.

Yx5iSat4aa	Yes you have it.|`|Zas9WXNwaa	I would recommend going to a different doctor.  If you tested positive for herpes, you have it and can spread it to other people through skin contact.    At the very least, your doctor should be willing to have a consultation with you to explore your options for reducing the severity and occurrence of outbreaks as well as counseling you on safer sex practices.  Find another doctor as soon as you can.  The one you went to doesn't sound like he's responding appropriately to your concerns.    Best of luck!|`|fAFXkikAaa	There is no such thing as an "exposure" to herpes.  You either have it - which means that you have the herpes virus in your body and can spread it - or you do not.    You don't say whether this was HSV1 or HSV2.   Most adults (50% to 80%) have oral herpes - which is usually caused by HSV1, but can be caused by HSV2.   So it is not surprising that you tested positive for HSV1 - if that's what you did indeed test for?    HSV1 usually infects the mouth, but can infect the genitals.  HSV2 usually infects the genitals, but can infect the mouth.  The problem with a blood test is that it tells you THAT you have herpes, but not where you have it.    So where does that leave you?       First, I would call the doctor back and ask if the test was for HSV1 or HSV2.  If it was HSV1, then I would assume you have oral herpes, and not give it another thought.   If it was HSV2, then I would assume that you do indeed have genital herpes.   Know that most people with genital herpes never experience any symptoms at all.      The one thing that we really don't know (and may never know) is if the irritation on your penis was a herpes outbreak (and it doesn't sound like one to me) or if it was indeed just an irritation, or a chlamydia infection or what.       If you do get another outbreak, I would suggest going TO A DIFFERENT DOCTOR and asking them for an opinion, and a swab test.  A swab test actually tests the sore itself.  If it comes back positive for herpes, then you know WHERE you have it (genitals versus oral.)    I do think that your doctor is very very badly informed.  Many general practitioners are confused and ill informed about herpes.   If you are in the US, I would recommend going to a Planned Parenthood or other free STD / Gynecological clinic (if you get other STD-like symptoms).  They see literally hundreds of cases of STDs and will be in a MUCH better position to help you.   And it doesn't matter that your a guy, they'll still see you.    If you want to read up on genital (and oral) herpes, I recommend the website below.  It's pretty easy to read, and RELIABLE - unlike some answers here, and apparently unlike some doctors.    Good luck.

Could yours be caused by anything similar?|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Skin rash is a rather nonspecific symptom. It's most likely to be caused by an irritant or allergen that came in contact with your skin.    Try taking some benadryl for a few days, or use hydrocortisone on it. See if that helps. If the rash gets worse, or does not respond to your over the counter treatments, you'll want to see a doctor for a diagnosis.    I wouldn't be too worried about it, but it is best to take care of it before it gets out of hand.
e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	Contrary to popular belief, that is not true. Giving birth sometimes makes the pelvic floor drop and will make one feel looser. There is an exercise that helps with that, it is called a Kegel. If you google it, you will be able to read instructions on how to do it.    Sex does not make it loose.|`|l9rTvb5Daa	Good advice so far,Kegel,s do work! I've been married for 25 yrs. and we have 3 kids& I have no complaints|`|KKh8rikGaa	I think sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,get me out,help|`|87pV5lvZaa	Yes, it is true, though a woman would become "stretched out" not exactly "loose."  The good news is that many women are now turning to Kegel exercises to tone their vaginae (just like they could use hand weights to tone their arms).  Like any other muscle in your body, your vagina can become weak over time.  Also, like any other muscle in your body, it can be strengthened.     Google "Kegel exercises."  These simple daily drills will tighten a stretched vagina right up!
FEVQisMGaa	Speaking for myself:    If you eat small portions of HEALTHY food, you can increase your metabolic rate, which is crucial for burning fat w/ minimal exercise.    If you gorge on food, it tricks your body into storing energy for fat reserves--like when bears hibernate.

wDtA9hrhaa	I've read your exercises before and I have to say this is due to Over exercising! i know it. Your body is using up all the minerals and calories it can to sustain you, and that means you can lack important minerals like serotonin (that boost your mood), and selenium. With out these minerals you may feel depressed, lethargic and fatigued. Your achy b/c you lack GAPA, which is a mineral that comes from Carbs. WIth out this mineral you can also feel depressed (maybe even suicidal) and your muscles tend to cramp up after over excercising with out GAPA.|`|b19cc68ada6c8d2f74de9e2f2d1eb8c3aa	It could be a stomach virus that will go away on its own but, remember your body has to get used to eating and digesting again. I'm guessing you were anorexic for more than 2 weeks so you can't expect to be back to normal in 2 weeks. I would check with your doctor to be on the safe side and I'm sure he/she will agree with me. Good luck.|`|AA12269056	dear jonas,    please see a doctor    your health is very important  and there are other reasons you may be having these symptoms.  check it out  please|`|UTZC8dlHaa	Please take care of yourself.  I believe you are exercising a little too much.  Please talk to your doctor and get a specialist to help you.  This is a serious illness and you will need help.
3zg7oBA5aa	They say you can, and they have special midwives that help.    They also say you need to have the right setting (like.. not a hospital) but something more romantic with like a tub, and some candles or something.  Lots of kissing and gentle massages from your husband. (or whoever you love!)    Lots of movement.    It's still painful, but I think they're open minded enough to let it become pleasurable at some times which helps with the original pain.|`|IxP2IMbcaa	If the baby is able to grab hold of your clit on the way out then yes it is possible.|`|p20v99N2aa	Don't know.

e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	You may have hyperhydrosis, excessive sweating. First of all, how are you using the Secret Clinical Strength. It is only effective when you apply it the night before you wear it. You dont use it like regular deodorant. Make sure you are using it right. Mithcum is also good for sweatiness.     You may want to visit the doctor. Some people get Botox under their arms to stop the sweating.|`|sKxx9YAIaa	a dr. can prescribe an antiperspirant, or if it is really bad, botox injections can help. definitely ask your dr.
cieM9vIzaa	I believe in "Mood Rings" with a reasonable grain-of-salt (as they say).  "Mood Rings" are only remotely accurate at best as they change colors based primarily on fluctuations in your surface body-temperature & somewhat the surrounding temperature as well.  Some are more accurate than others.  It also depends on the individual's surface body-temperature who is wearing the "Mood Ring".|`|3vBALAlaaa	Depends what brand, if it's cheap, it's probably filled with flaw.   And yes they do work, but can be fooled easily. When your body experiences different emotions, it causes hormones that cause heat (This is why when cartoons are mad, steam comes out of their ears) and it causes the mood ring to change color. But, as I said, they can be fooled. If your in a cool environment, it will turn the color of the coolest emotion, and likewise in a hot environment. Also, if you heat up or cool down a mood ring, it will do the same.|`|X6HUimEFaa	yes  please answer my questionssss|`|Ann7Jyhoaa	Nope, they work by the heat on your finger, it may sometimes work by chance but you can't decide what mood you're in from how hot your hand is.

Maybe I am just a emotionless person, but  damn, I can't be that bad, right!    Have a nice day, my friend.
2beeb428b630fe34c36e748e0fd66b3aaa	Yes, because actually, there IS Omega 3 in egg yolk:    "One important set of nutrients that should not be overlooked is the long-chain essential fatty acids. Egg yolks contain the long-chain omega-3 fatty acid DHA, which is necessary for the brain and proper retinal function in the eye, and the long-chain omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid, which is required for the healthy skin, hair, libido, reproduction, growth and response to injury."|`|AA11065140	There can be, if they add it.

X5fEQGgNaa	OMG YES!  be careful!    i can't believe people don't know this.  of course the woman can die.  she's already bleeding.  ramming her several hundred times with the footlong can make bleeding become profuse and she can die from hemorrhaging.    as for your second question - the only way for the doctor to tell is if, during the examination, you start leaking a little leftover d*ck cheese onto his glove.  then it's pretty obvious and you're SOL.    cheers!

In fact it can help with cramps.  The only way a dr can tell you've had sex is if there is semen still present in the vaginal passage.|`|AA11895447	No a woman will not die if she has sex while on her period. Actually, a lot of women like having sex while menstruating, the orgasm eases the cramps, and due to the increased blood flow to the area, it's more sensitive, and feels better.     The doctor cannot tell precisely if you have had sex the day before, but there are signs. For example, more lubrication, semen left in the vagina, etc. But unless they ask you and you tell the truth yes or no, they cannot tell 100% just by looking at it.|`|BI8c6XXPaa	Nope. I am not dead, lol.|`|QSB7rXFfaa	probably false...|`|B6oGxwaxaa	No it actually quit healthy i think .....|`|DH4o26rIaa	No woman will die if they have sex while on their period.

Other women know what they like and issue instructions, [thank heavens for the lovers that can actually speak!] ... and take charge of their needs, desires and whims.

If that doesn't work either, then sometime outside of bed you will have to just be open and talk about it. Don't say "I hate" or "You are bad at".

AA11459417	Hemophilia is a blood disorder in which the blood lacks the thrombocytes that cause clotting.  Therefore, any cut that bleeds will not stop bleeding because the blood will not clot.  It's a very serious condition that people are born with -- you can't "get" it.  If a person is a hemophiliac, they're ALWAYS a hemophiliac -- there's no such thing as getting treatment that cures it and then getting it again, since the condition NEVER goes away.  I'm thinking that you may be referring to the wrong term.|`|AA11388527	You have GOT to be asking about something else.

BKKDOhFDaa	Anesthesia generally wears off in about 2-4 hours.  Depending on the dentist and the degree of difficulty of the extractions, it can take 20 minutes or it could take an hour.  A one surface resin posterior filling should only take 20-30 minutes including anesthetic.  I wouldn't recommend trying to "hurry" the dentist.  Remember that your oral care is a priority too and that you can't rush great work from the dentist!|`|ef12417264c6b17f893513b9d20cec60aa	usually baby teeth can be extracted in 10 min your filling should take about 20 min so your appt should not be any longer then 45 min but be aware that you will be numb for about 3 hours.
ckdYl9Znaa	Nothing strikes fear into the heart of any woman like a missed period, unless she is trying to get pregnant. Am I pregnant? Pregnancy is the first thing that we think of when our period is delayed. But is pregnancy the only reason for people to have a late period? Here are the 10 most common reasons that you missed your period:       1. Stress        Stress can affect many things in our lives, including our periods. Sometimes we're so stressed out that our body decreases the amount of a hormone (GnRH), which causes us to not ovulate or menstruate. Working with your doctor or midwife can help you figure out what you need to do to relax and get back on schedule.       2. Illness        A sudden, short illness or even a longer illness can cause your periods to be delayed. This is usually temporary.       3. Change in Schedules        Changing schedules can really throw off your body clock. This is particularly true if you go from days to nights at work or vice versa.       4. Change in Medications        Perhaps you're trying a new medication and a delayed or absent period is the cause. Be sure to talk to your doctor or midwife about this side effect. It is very common with some methods of birth control.       5. Being Overweight        Carrying around too much weight can hormonally shift your cycles and even stop them. Most women will see a return to normal cycles and fertility with the loss of some weight.       6. Being Underweight        If you do not have enough body fat you will not have regular periods, sometimes you can eve cause your periods to stop all together. This is called amenorrhea. Typically a weight gain will help you have your periods return. This is a frequent cause of a missed period in women who work out to an extreme or are professional athletes.       7. Miscalculation[        The menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman. While we say that the average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, that is not true for everyone. Sometimes our period is believed to be late when in all actuality we have simply miscalculated. If you have irregular menstrual cycles, but know when you ovulate, look for your period about two weeks after you ovulate. That may help you keep an easier track of your periods.       8. Peri-Menopause        Peri-menopause is the period of time where you are transitioning from reproductive age to a non-reproductive age. Your periods may be lighter, heavier, more frequent or less frequent - but mostly just not normal. If you do not wish to get pregnant, be sure to continue to use birth control because you are likely to still be fertile at least some of the time.       9. Menopause        Menopause is when you have reached the point in your life where you will no longer ovulate or menstruate. Menopause can be a natural life event or may happen surgically through hysterectomy or through chemical such as chemotherapies.      10. Pregnancy        Finally! Yes, your missed period might be because you're pregnant! A simple pregnancy test can usually help you determine if you have missed your period because you are pregnant. The urine pregnancy tests and blood pregnancy tests look for the hormone hCG.    What to do next?    If you are pregnant, you should call to make a prenatal appointment with your midwife or doctor. It normally takes a bit to get you in so call right away.    If you have taken a pregnancy test and it is negative. Most tests advise you to wait another week and retest. If the second test is negative or if you have a good idea of why your period is missing, then you can and should call the doctor or midwife sooner for a physical exam. They may also do blood work and can sometimes prescribe medications to help bring on a tardy period, like Provera.|`|oUd9ZIDLaa	It means right before you get you period  you eat something you dont usually eat or you excersise way to much np.|`|Na3C1sPtaa	lighter and heavier days|`|dd6rgtL7aa	It means you're lucky.

Early pregnancy signs are - feeling sick constantly, no period, increased sensitvity to smells and tastes, tender breasts, fatigue, frequent urination and headaches.    Other causes if that is negative could be - too much excercise or too little, poor diet, stress and worry.    You could have a hormone imbalance which can cause lack of periods or very heavy /or/ light periods, mood swings, excess body hair, headaches.    Here is a website on that -     http://www.hormone-healthy.com/Causes_of...        Take care hun      xx
bNwSwcy0aa	wow really good that you decided to do something about your weight.. congrats!!!   a healthy weight loss would be around 1-2pounds per week.. which is around 8-16pounds in 2months.. you can do this by changing your diet.. you need to stop eating fatty/greasy/sugary foods.. no cola.. no sweets.. eat more vegetables , dairy products , fruits , lean meats.. eat your breakfast.. eat 4-5 smaller meals a day.. keep one day a week where you eat nething that you want so that you dont end up cheating on the other days.. do portion control..  alongwith this you will need to exercise.. start slow if you do no exercise right now.. start with walking or jogging.. you could do running/aerobics/spinning/dance/some game that you njoy for 60min a day.. you should also include some weight training 2-3 times a week..   all this sounds a little difficult but once you get in the habbit you will never want to go back to what you were.. and this will reduce your weight and keep it off..  good luck!!!!|`|1L5Uq3voaa	Yes, you're a bit overweight, but I'm sorry- 25 lbs is too much for 2 months. You shouldn't lose more than 8 lbs per month. It can make you seriously ill.    But if you want to lose SOME weight, running is excellent. Run 2 miles in the morning, or less if you can't do that much. Trust me, it's great for burning calories.|`|L0873cdDaa	Do 45 minutes of cardio like running or an elliptical machine 4 days a week.

It helps with cholesterol.|`|87pV5lvZaa	It seems that you have heard the phrase "oatmeal is good for your skin," but that sentence does not refer to EATING oatmeal.  Oatmeal has been included in beauty products, such as facial scrubs and body lotions, for decades due to its soothing properties.  Actually, the popular brand Aveno is known for its use of oatmeal in its products.  Also, some homeopathic doctors recommend taking a bath in oatmeal (yes, I'm serious) when your skin is excessively dry or irritated.    Don't get me wrong: oatmeal is a relatively healthy breakfast, but its healing properties refer to it being applied, not ingested.|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	Absolutely oatmeal is good for your skin. Also drink a lot of cranberry juices (the good kind with a lot of actual cranberry juice in it) and white tea and eat blueberries. Those are all great antioxidants and they help remove impurities from the body which keeps your skin nice and healthy. Also getting a little sun helps keep the oils dries out in your skin so if you aren't in a sunny place hit up the tanning salon once or twice a week for a few minutes. Another thing is to try and avoid touching your face and if you wear make up try to get the bare minerals stuff. It keeps the pores open. I also like to use a mint julep mask once in a while. This stuff is all great for your skin. There are a ton more but these work great for me.
Sozc3MyFaa	AC does not absorb gasoline.  Their really is no front line treatment for gasoline ingestion and there is some controversy over the use of emetics (Ellenhorn).  The best is a scoop & run approach with admission to ICU for full support (350cc can be fatal in an adult).  Since gasoline is a complex compound of hydrocarbons, paraffins, benzene, and lead, different treatments must be tailored to each of the compounds and the degree of organ involvement.|`|0KaadzHzaa	I was about to give a long answer but the PA is correct. Activated Charcoal will not absorb petroleum products.

Losing weight takes effort.|`|orXTbOY8aa	Start running fatty!|`|VgWdE9NFaa	You need to go with your parents to a dietitian.  They are doctors that will help you lose weight safely, and should be able to explain it in a manner your parents can understand.  Don't waste your time with patches or pills, the first two answers are obviously advertising plants (looks like somebody deleted them).
vkrQ29lOaa	Sugary foods and drinks; avoid garlic and other strong-tasting items. That said, however, be careful not to trigger diabetes or weight gain by loading up on sugar!

AA10458296	Nahh. You're just a few pounds more than me and I'm 5'2. You could tone up, but I don't think you're fat. You are probably right in the middle of the healthy weight range (Google: "BMI calculators") Step up the exercising a little and cut calories at each meal and you could lose about a pound a week. Remember, TV advertised diets aren't for young teenagers to lose weight with, they're for people who are too lazy to do the obvious. Try taking an extra 30 minute jog every day and walk if you get too tired. It's good for your endurance as well!    As for everyone else, don't listen to them when they call you fat, you could develop low self-esteem and that is not what you want to deal with later in life! You are much too young to have to worry about what you weigh or eat.|`|1L5Uq3voaa	5'1'' and 118 isn't bad. But if you want to, you should start running in the morning.

Best of luck!    -Mel|`|hXaAxd1Gaa	eat healthier. one really easy way is to substitute all dfrinks for water, really it works!  and get a little exercise in there by walking or something else yuou enjoy|`|BRT2teSqaa	Yes you are a bit above normal, becauseyou are very short.

Your BMI (Body Mass Index) is 22, which is within the normal limits for your height. If it got to 25 or more, that would be considered overweight. Perhaps your family, in telling you to watch your weight, are talking from their own experience; if they themselves are overweight, or if they have overweight family members, they know how weight can be an issue, and don't want you to have to struggle with your weight. If they're really skinny, and you're more on the average side of things, they could be concerned because you appear so different from the family norm, and again, they don't want you to have to struggle. This doesn't mean you have a problem. It means that your family loves you, and are trying to protect you. It's just that it's a sticky subject: no one likes to be told to lose weight, no matter by who. And it's easier to get mad at our family and close friends for telling us unpleasant things, than to get mad at anyone else. But really, I think they're overreacting. You may be out of shape, but the numbers say you're not necessarily overweight.    What you should do now, to maintain your weight, and prevent yourself from ever becoming overweight, is institute a proper fitness routine, cut out any junk you may be eating, and learn the basics of nutrition. Do you drink regular soda? Do you know that most people can drink the equivalent of their needed daily calories in sugary sodas without even knowing it? Stuff like that. There are tons and tons of free resources online and at your local library, including fitness videos. Ever wonder what yoga or pilates, or for that matter, belly dancing,  are like? Check out a couple videos from your library. If you like doing those routines, you may like to explore those types of fitness programs a little more. If you hate them, you didn't waste any money on trying them.    Keep active, eat enough and eat right, get plenty of sleep and fluids, and you'll be just fine.|`|L0873cdDaa	Just do some exercises at home. Run around the block, situps, pushups, get some 5-10 pound free weights. Eat healthy too.

pjYQhPPBaa	It's not possible to be in love at your age, especially with a 17 year old. Even most 17 year olds don't know what being in love is like. You two are in different points in your lives, and have different mentalities and maturity levels.    I don't think it's illegal to date (though I don't know if both of your parents will allow that), but if you have sex, even though you're both minors, it's still illegal. The legal age of consent in most states is either 14 or 16.|`|JxUFDutxaa	Yes, it's far..too far.    You're not even a teenager...I'm sure you're a great person and all..but it would be very odd if as a teenager soon to head off to college..he fell for a 12 year old.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Very far off but I've meet a 12 year old girl who was more developed than some 17 year old girls and she was very mature. I was 14.|`|y7EoXgeXaa	alright.   i'm pree sure you're not in love.   and its too far off.   i really wouldn't recommend it.   alot of older boys aren't after love.     be careful.|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	It's not that he's too old--the problem is that you're far too young.
ikbHM3tUaa	Actually there is a drug interaction between these two medications.     You can still take both of them BUT you must take the Zinc either 6 hours before or 2 hours after the minocycline.    The reason for this is that the zinc will bind to the drug in your stomach, and it will not be absorbed and get to wherever the infection is. To deal with this you must follow the above instructions to make sure the minocycline is fully cleared from your stomach before you take the zinc.
MSfsg9dBaa	well the reason most women bleed when they have sex for the first time is because their hymen gets torn by the penis. so you probably broke it with a tampon or maybe playing sports. Vigorous activity can tear it.|`|XtbjzpK7aa	maybe when you were younger you broke it. but shouldnt you be happy that you didnt bleed?|`|zKEVdGv2aa	Other things can partially break the hymen, such as vigorous exercise, horseback riding, the passage of menstrual blood, and using tampons. So I wouldn't worry about it. I didn't bleed or hurt at all when I lost my virginity.|`|OuU9Emkxaa	A lot of other things can break your hymen. for example; Sports with a lot of leg movement like gymnastics or cheerleading; it could even be from something like horseback riding or something else where your vagina is constantly rubbing something. Plus even if it did break during the process of losing your virginity, you could have been so lost in the pleasure of the moment that it didn't hurt. It doesnt always have to bleed a ton!|`|QxklCj75aa	I lost my virginity a week and a half ago. I didn't bleed at all. You can break your hymen by doing simple things like riding a bicycle or using a tampon. Even masturbating can break it. Anyway, you shouldn't worry about it because it's normal and it happens.
0wkGO3L1aa	I was gestational with both children and YES it can be scary. The second time was much easier than the first because I understood what was going on. For your own well being research find out as much as you can because the more knowledge you have the better you feel, the less stress you are under the easier the sugars are to control.    Your numbers sound good for GD. Find endocrinologist and nutritionist who deals with GD. They can follow your progress by reporting your number to them, prescribe medication that is best for you and your baby, advise you, encourage you, make changes to your medicine and write up your orders for delivery.    When I was pregnant I was told Fasting >100 and 1 hour after I eat >120, From research the baby does not start getting sugar until about 140 but there is about 20% margin of error in monitors. If you have a reading unusually high or low you should retest (if it is a big difference retest for a 3rd time).    Learn what foods react poorly to your body. While something may have the right carb content - it may make your body spike.    Because you are past your 1st trimester you should be able to take pills.    Ask your OB for another ultrasound in the beginning of 3rd trimester to measure the size of the baby and the amount of amniotic fluid.    They SHOULD NOT let you go past your due date.    They should monitor you more closely in your last trimester with OB appt. closer together and non stress test starting 30-34 weeks.    Exercise (walking is great!) and eat right. Once I got the diet and medicine in line I felt the best I had felt in my whole life!|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Fanny is right.  Under 140 is OK.  Avoid sugar.|`|plwuZ0Kuaa	Your sugar is high because you cant breakdown the protien  . While you are pregnant its hard to get around the medicine the doctors give you.    I have my daughter on Formula 1 Healthy Meal Shake and multivitamin (Only) She is pregnant now This should help you some now.     I have several friends who have diabetes and had it for over 15 years and after 45 days they are now insulin free .   When you have the baby I sugest  these products ( They Work) and they break down the protien .    Shapeworks Ultimate program Plus  Herbalifeline  Core complex  niteworks    You can get these at www.healthshop4you.com   Its a small price to pay to get your life back|`|RXI8ImdIaa	There is nothing to be afraid of. If your blood sugar is not responding well enough to dietary changes, you will need to take insulin for a while to control it.    The majority of cases of gestational diabetes resolve themselves after the pregnancy. Sometimes it doesn't go away. It's not very worthwhile to stress out over that now, though, because that is not happening right now.    For the time being, take care of your health and your baby's. Discuss your anxiety with the dietician or the obgyn, they will be able to answer your specific questions and give you good advice.|`|ikbHM3tUaa	this can be a difficult problem some mothers face, but honestly the medications are well-tolerated, not to expensive and very safe for your baby.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	if going on medication is what's best for you and your baby you should probably reconsider it especially if your sugars are high.|`|dcNmRPGPaa	sounds like you need another doctor because 50-140 is the desired range.anything over 140 is high. i too am gestational diabetic and am carrying a very big boy because of it. i check my sugar 7 times a day and take shots twice a day. just keep your carbs low, no refined sugars or starches and get lots of protein. you'll be fine.
5sPzk31oaa	It really depends, if you are concerned about your looks when having braces, then you might as well choose lingual orthodontics.  Im not too sure if one or the other is faster but i know these are faster than regular braces (with the coloured rubber bands)    http://www.gacinovation.com/    i had braces and Im not too sure if these are the braces I got but they look and seem like it. they are smaller and they are easier to move (meaning when your teeth change shape , it hurts less)    hope this really helps!    ps. i have my braces off now, my friends say they are so used to having me with my braces off i look different even though with those special braces on, it only took less than a FULL year.|`|3vBALAlaaa	Braces are more effective, and take sooner, but are a pain. would be a pain either way though. I have braces and they suck, but the Lingual would suck too.|`|T0pkW783aa	Consult with your orthodontist to see which will give you the best results and to see how long they would have to be worn.  If the results are the same, go with the braces that don't look like you have them on.  My son just had the lingual ones and his teeth look amazing after only 8 months.  They were worth every dime.

FEVQisMGaa	What do you hope to achieve?    EDIT:    There's a technique that the observant of warriors et al. have discovered. It's been described as muscle confusion.    Speaking for myself:    You'll notice that when you do the same exercise over and over, you experience diminishing returns. Meaning: the more you do the same exercise, the less effective it will be in improving you/that particular area.    The trick is to constantly change what you do. Don't restrict yourself to just weight lifting. The healthiest, leanest body structures are those of surfers, military special warfare operators, really skilled swimmers, and martial artists.    Take up yoga, surfing, and an asian-oriented fighting style w/ rules on aesthetics.
7QERhhRJaa	You need 200.0 Ratio Salbutamol HFA100mcg/dose  and also Spiriva 18mcg/capsule PD INH   These are both inhalers. One will clear your sinus problems the other your lungs. You will need a prescription for it and I can't do one for you here. Good luck.
lwG6tvOqaa	You need to go to the doctor immediately. If you think that is bleach poisoning, then that could be fatal, and i know that you wouldn't want to leave your son without a mom.    Even if it isn't related tothe bleach, then you should still  go just to be safe.|`|b04999b0e7ff207909ed958e37c605caaa	you should see a doctor... bleach eats away very badly at proteins ( basically any thing inside your body )|`|Nzqt4Qu7aa	Call your doctor, hospital, or a physician. Either one of those, you should really go get some tests done to see what it is.|`|yb7DffnJaa	I'd at least go to a Patient First  type facility just to make sure. Symptoms like that, that include chest pain should be considered serious. Even without the bleach information, I would still advise you to go. They, minimally,  will determine if you should go to an ER.|`|hOwkTiHAaa	due to the chest pain and difficulty breathing...see a doctor because they are not typical flu symptoms but depending on how long ago the poisoning was, if you're improving then i wouldnt worry about it but if ur the same or worse then you should have already gone|`|Ba0AduWcaa	No, don't worry about it.  You would have been in a coma by now..  Never do that again!   Your liver will clear it out..  Bleach is highly toxic chemical.  Never mess with it..|`|8oU70OLiaa	Go get it checked out, doctors are the best people to ask|`|mow5yyWNaa	try see the Doctor or something and make sure you tell him about the bleach
65b739e5b9d094878a3892dab9316ec7aa	I smoke but have quit several times about 1 year bein the longest stretch. As far as your breath goes, it can be gone in as little as 4 days from my experince. It's as simple as brushing, and gargling alot. The more focused i was on getting clean breath and whiter teeth the more i paid close attention on cleaqning my mouth. It also helped keep my mind off of smoking. The cleaner it was everytime i ate something the slightest thing in my teeth drove me straight to the sink, next was the hair brush etc.. it will keep u busy, as well as focused on smoking negatives. About the lungs i;m not to sure the longer you've smoked the longer it takes and it is  quite awhile.  Good luck and hang tuff. Someone told me this once and it helped alot. Once you quit you might get an urge to smoke but, it only last a few minutes the it goes away,. That is true. So just wait a minute and it will pass.|`|1kZenfZzaa	You should be able to kiss the next day, just brush your teeth first.  I hear it takes 4 days or 96 hours to get out of your system, like if you were going to take a drug test.  So I don't think it will stay on your breath too long.|`|giBfNMX6aa	Once you have: 1)brushed your teeth  2)washed your hair  3)wear clothes that you've washed since quitting, you should smell fine.  I quit 4 years ago.  It was hard, but really worth it.  The web site below will give you a lot of info on the benefits of quitting.  Good luck!

xvey8ixPaa	All of these questions should be asked of the office that did your procedures. Only the Doctor that you saw knows what you had done and what you should be able to expect. none of us know your case. to my knowledge none of us are MD doctors. You need to call the office where you got your surgery.

06HPTp3uaa	Yep.  Its because you're starring at a computer for a few hours. You're head will hurt and so will your eyes.   It sucks. I just lay down and sleep for like 10 minutes or so.  Same thing with watching to much television, or reading for a really long time.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	not sick, but my eyes start to kill me. which inturn gives me a headache sometimes.|`|pcm7yY2Saa	Yeah actually I do. I usually end up with a horrible headache and become really nauseous. I usually have to lay down and rest.

I sometimes get carried away with work on my computer and I get those nauseating headaches and have to stop what I'm doing and lay down.
xqtS3rWAaa	Have a bigger breakfast or lunch. If you eat big meals earlier in the day, you will burn these calories by dinner time and you will not get so hungry. Try eating from all four food groups at these meals.     Or you can try eating only fruit a 4 pm. This is healthy and you won't be stuffed for dinner.|`|8df61e6bfe8263f863d58536e87602e0aa	have an apple with 1 tbsp of peanut butter. its a protein and a fiber and a healthy carb so itll fill you up with about 150 calories. the pb also has healthy fats and the apple has natural sugars so you will get a boost of energy and satisfy a salty/swet craving. its my favorite snack|`|QfTEYT3zaa	You're actually not eating a whole lot in the morning so that might explain why you're so hungry at four! Although what you're eating sounds  healthy, quite a few studies have shown that people who eat more calories earlier in the day are less likely to feel hungry later in the day and find it easier not to overeat.     So for breakfast, why not have a big bowl of cereal (make sure its healthy, not sugary crap)  AND fruit and have a whole sandwich (on wholegrain bread) at lunch.     Healthy snacks you can have include dried fruit, nuts, one piece of wholegrain bread with healthy toppings, veggies and salsa|`|i930YAzzaa	here's my idea. i think you need to have more protein in your diet. but if you're a vegetarian that won't due. one thing that fills me up is buttered toast with a couple slices of bacon on it. don't know why, but it keeps me filled up a good while.|`|AA11481224	because your not eating enough    breakfast needs to be cereal fruit and toast  lunch needs to be a whole sandwich  piece of fruit and veggie sticks and the yogurt    snack add some raisins and a piece of fruit|`|gERaZGZeaa	"i meant to put why do i get so hungry"    You really need to ask this question?

2sycPf8Daa	Chest pain is a symptom of a number of serious conditions and is generally considered a medical emergency. Chest pain is one of the most frightening symptoms a person can have.    Having sharp stinging pain in the lower part of your heart. A common cause of chest pain is called  Stable Angina.  Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that typically occurs with activity or stress. The pain usually begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes before going away. It quickly goes away with medication or rest, but may happen again with additional activity or stress.    Stable angina is also called chronic angina. The most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breastbone or slightly to the left. It may feel like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or crushing pain. The pain may spread to shoulder, arm, jaw, neck, back, or other areas.   Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion.     Chest pain? The list of potential causes in long and may take a little bit of time to determine the precise cause. I am not a doctor, but you dont have to give up. Continue to see your doctor regularly, do not stop! You sound very anxious.   In conclusion I suggest encouraging yourself to be more open to your doctor. A good Internal Medicine doctor should be able to work through the potential causes of your symptoms:chest pains.    Take care always! OIRAM|`|UTZC8dlHaa	See your doctor and ask his guidance.  Knowing what is wrong is always better than guessing. Get going!|`|aAHVsJEvaa	that would be bad. i would recommend going to see a doctor and losing weight.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	Firstly it is quite rare to have a young person with heart disease. Secondly you do not get heart disease in a week..it takes years of  body abuse. Thirdly..if the pain comes and then goes...it may not be heart pains..but some other cause. You are obviously unfit....and should not be as you are a diabetic. I suggest that you see a doctor to work out a diet and exercise plan. I would give you one..if you were not diabetic..but with this condition I am not risking it. It should be worked out with the medical expert
pF3VmiqUaa	You can get the regular metal ones or the white/clear looking ones.  You can also get different color elastics that go on your braces depending on what colors are available at your orthodontists office.  I've gotten pink, blue, green, and even brown.|`|FDQFrP5haa	Definitely. You can get alternating 2 colours all the way along if you want, my sister gets it every time.|`|o40QqoQGaa	yes, i have had a whole pattern of colors before, I had like 6 different colors, including glow in the dark. It was pretty coo =]|`|htAuzn9faa	yes u can alternate of get one color on the top and one on the botton they will do whatever u want

tVn7pfqKaa	That's all dependant on the length of your tongue and the placement of the peircing, it's bound to vary between people..if you have a long tongue and the piercings on the end, you'll most likely have some irritation from it.|`|giBfNMX6aa	Your orthodontist will probably make you take it out.  Just wait until you are done with braces.  Hopefully you'll change your mind, those things are really gross.|`|2gdWeMRfaa	one of my friends had a tongue piercing and his orthodontist made him take it off during the actual procedure and when they got adjusted but i dont think it was a problem in between|`|0d4c9f6122693a445077a17a9d8ceb08aa	Don't get your tongue pierced or in a few years down the road, you will have major problems with your teeth and gums. It happened to my daughter. You will end up seeing a periodontist and they are VERY expensive. Please don't do it.
0IZ2SYmYaa	No, you aren't too young. An eighteen year old died of a heart attack before. You should see a doctor if you are concerned about your health.|`|UTZC8dlHaa	No, you are not too young. Please see a doctor ASAP. Something is not quite right. Knowing is better than not knowing what ails you.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	Although young people do die from heart attacks..it is quite rare on the young. The fact that you jumped at a quote "boom" on TV and nothing happened should tell you that your heart (as far as this is concerned) is okay. Do you run to catch buses? Do you enjoy any activity at all? If so... do you feel dizzy..or short of breath when you do these activities/ If so then I would suggest that you see your doctor for a check up|`|K69z1nXjaa	clam down first.... i read a book and it says laughter and optimisim, and happiness is the key to a long life. If this is getting seroius, ask your doctor... i would do it asap if i were u|`|YgzpSbxdaa	You should see a doctor. They will do a chest xray and and ECG (both are painless, neither require needles). But regardless of whether it is a heart attack or not, maybe it is a sign that you should be doing activities.   It could also be anxiety. Panic attacks can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, you could also be having tension headaches. Skipping meals over long periods of time can also have the same result. I don't know what your food habits are like, but sometimes we can get so busy we forget to eat at least 3 meals per day.|`|EIaVSdPLaa	You are never too young to have a heart attack.  How healthy are you? If you are over weight or have high cholesterol then your chances of having a heart attack are that of a seventy year old man. If you are fighting fit and healthy then you should be very concerned. I advise seeing a doctor asap, the pain in your left arm is very disturbing. You may just be stressed as the migraines demonstrate, hence the fright you get when something loud or sudden happens. If your tests come back clear (You will most likely have xrays and an ECG done at this stage) i advise going to see a therapist or councilor.     Cheers,  Donna
bAxAhQr9aa	Alright,   Well if anything hurts than talk with your Mom.  If nothing hurts just wait until morning to see if there is any blood in your underwear.  Tell you Mom about this either way... you can ask her when she got her period because if she was 12, well I think you would know what that is...  Good Luck, I wouldn't worry about it thought.|`|lZ9Dl5Nhaa	Go back to the bathroom, and take some toilet paper and swipe it a little bit inside of your vagina.  If there's blood on there, it's your period.  If there's not, flush that one, get a new one, and wipe your butt and see if that's bloody.  If it is, tell your mom.|`|FcAK2gsOaa	It was your period most likely|`|MK547eboaa	well I would say that either it is your period, or something is wrong in your intestine, so you may want to talk to your mom and a doctor to see what is going on. Keep an eye on it for sure.
9pLdhuBnaa	Going to the bathroom frequently can also be an indication of a urinary tract infection.    Whenever I have gotten a urinary tract infection I would have frequent urination and not have the pain and burning.    I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Being high requires a certain amount of cognizance and alertness. Being drunk requires no alertness, cognizance, and often does not require consciousness.    People get high on pot, but usually simply get buzzed, tipsy, drunk or blatso on booze.    Cheers.|`|5wHCpGrHaa	theres different kinds of high, it all depends on what your taking. and being drunk makes you fell dizy and relaxed. being high on pot just makes evrything fun, being high on pain pills makes you really happy and relaxed, being high non uppers makes you alert, its not a very good high but its very very addicting, so it all depends on what drug your trying to compair it to.
pXP2QF8raa	Nah, you don't have frostbite. Maybe frost nip. don't worry, you're fine =]  Just warm your toes up!    Frostnip  "Like frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal formation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs and the crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip affects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, and toes. The skin turns pale and one experiences numbness or tingling in the affected part until warming begins."|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	Your fine. Just warm them up with cool water and once that feels like its room temperature up the temp on the water.|`|1UdSxaCZaa	Yea know your fine.
w2ijWy9vaa	Well since your athletic, whenever you over-indulge, work out like crazy. Don't stop until you feel you want to die. Then next time you see a delicious plate of food, think of that workout, hopefully that will keep you away from over-eating.|`|NSo7rg2taa	lose 10 lbs. I think 5'2 avg weight is 130.    Also, 140 isn't fat.
AA11388527	Your parents are trying to help you but they're going about it in the wrong way.  Don't wait for this to happen again.  Sit them both down and tell them exactly how their critical, demeaning remarks make you feel.  They will respond with "We're just trying to help you.  We want you to be healthy."  You tell them that while you appreciate this, with all due respect, you don't appreciate the way they do it.  You should not be forced to work out, punished for not doing so and they should keep their comments to themselves.  Their comments are rude, hurtful and thoughtless.  Ask them how they would feel if someone they know made the same comments to them.  It's no different for you.    Parents need to show respect and consideration to their children if they expect this in return.  And if you feel you need to watch your weight, then you'll deal with it.  When and if you need or want their help, you'll be sure to ask.    Print this out and read it to them if you like.  Good luck.|`|AA10458296	Working out (to me) is very personal and I hate working out with my mom or anyone else for that matter. If you work out with them you will hate it and hate their comments, so find something different that you can do on your own and away from them.     Talk to your parents and tell them you are old enough that you shouldn't have to exercise with them! Your diet is up to you as well. Don't let them get you down about yourself, they will cause you to have low self-esteem, and that is exactly the opposite of what they really want for you. They want you to be healthy, but that means you would be happy with yourself and it doesn't sound like you are.|`|r3o10XbAaa	Its not really a form or harrassment (as far as legal matters go), its just mean.  i would just go off at them and tell them to shut the **** up, either that or i would just ignore their comments. i recommend the going off at them. maybe they don't know how much it hurt you...|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well they may do this because they don't want you to be obese in the future or make unhealthy choices. I think you shouldn't worry about it and only worry about what weight you like yourself at. I am unsure if you have a small, medium, or large frame but this chart says if you have a small frame the highest you are suppose to be is 115. Check it out    http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/met.htm|`|QfTEYT3zaa	Depending on how bad it is it could be a form of emotional abuse. Its really damaging to have the people who should love and care about you the most being critical of you. You need to be firm with them and let them know what they're doing is unacceptable.     Next time they say something critical, answer them with a calm but forceful response that lets them know you still realise they're you parents but they're actually being inappropriate. Maybe something like "I realise you want me to be fit and healthy, and thats great, but I'm actually feeling really hurt by your comments' or "I'm glad you care so much about my health but what you're saying is hurting my feelings"     If they're punishing you for not working out, why not demand that they let you do exercise that you find fun and enjoyable - make them pay for you to do dance classes, karate, rock climbing or anything else fun and active where you don't feel like you're 'working out'     Finally, you're 17, so I think you're old enough to say to your parents 'Thanks for caring, but I'm old enough to make my own mistakes. If I need health and fitness advice I know I can always ask you but otherwise, leave it alone'|`|Qlrh3Z4Maa	Yea, I disagree with Kate on this. You should simply talk to them in a sensible manner and tell them how you feel about it. They only pressure you about it because they care about you and want you to be healthy, although it does seem that they are going a bit overboard. I understand what you mean though, my friend, who is your age, is pressured by his parents to lift weights and bulk up. His parents actually own a gym and feed him protein shakes. My parents, on the overhand, got worried and took me to the doctor when I healthily lost 30 extra pounds a few years ago when I was fat.|`|qHhn3r4qaa	I'm not sure about the harassment but I don't think it is. You could try to tell your parents to lay off, but if you don't think it will work, or if it will just anger them, you might not want too. From your description I'm assuming just going along with it and doing what they say is out of the question. Again I'd say to make comments about their choices but that might piss them off. I'm sorry to say that unless I knew your parents personally I really can't tell you what you should do. Good luck!|`|w2ijWy9vaa	What they are doing to you can be dangerous. They can make you develop a eating disorder soon or later on in life. You need to tell them to stop making comments, and don't ask them to stop, TELL THEM! Look them in the eye and say STOP. I just think they are being ordinary parents, being overprotective by trying to keep you healthy. Which is good....to an extent.
MK547eboaa	Well it may depend on sports you do, medications you may take, even a daily vitamin can do something weird to it. Also until you are around the age 17 or 18 your hormones are still changing and such, so that is going to throw off your period some. Also, if it is coming around the same time, just a few days off, then you are ok, cause timing isn't always exact with lovely little nature. But if it keeps getting later and later and later than the month before, I would speak with a doctor.|`|t9Nw86Plaa	Yes, this is normal for someone of your age and build. Since you are 16, I'm guessing you're only starting your period; in the first year or so almost all women are irregular. Also, irregularlity (particularly, late periods/ long cycles, and missed periods) is more common in thin women.
P544Sbmqaa	Marrow and other hematopoetic stem cells are matched by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) tissue type.  It is a very complicated form of matching that gets into dna testing.  There are thousands of people in need every day that cannot find a match because the level of match needed is so complicated.    The other answer is wrong about it being worse for a donor though.  First, most donations are actually peripheral blood stem cells, which is an out patient aphersis proceedure that is no problem at all.  But even when actual marrow is used, its done under general anesthesia or an epidural, and I promise that going through the transplant is enormously worse than the surgery to donate actual marrow.  Getting the transplant really is just an IV, but the prep regimen for the transplant of high dose chemo and radiation and all the aftermath is 100 times worse than the marrow donor proceedure, I PROMISE.|`|AA10531094	No|`|3f6656b4b1c9055aeefeb6b07165a17daa	it's very, very difficult to find an exact match in a bone marrow transplant.  That's why it's so important to get swabbed and be placed in the national database.  However it's actually worse for the person donating than the person receiving, but it is totally worth it to save someone's life.

I've know of someone who fell from a tree and scattered there leg because of a really bad "trip" Also, if your doing a research paper make sure it's facts and strong information to help inform people.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Acid is a hallucinogenic drug, and it really screws with your brain.  People do all sorts of stupid **** when they're baked.  I once read this article about a kid on shrooms who tore his skin completely up with his nails b/c he thought bugs were crawling all over him.  Basically, you lose all common sense when you're on a drug that powerful, and you see things that aren't there, and hear things that aren't there, so yeah, it's very possible that somehing like that could happen.|`|r8owV9esaa	yes.. look up lsd murders|`|Ann7Jyhoaa	I couldn't find anything but because it's a hallucinogen you could assume someone to be picking on you or 'out to get you' Yes in some cases if you're really paranoid you could kill someone in 'defence'      =+)|`|IS2FfWV3aa	yes, people will kill people on LSD very easily. The only circumstance that isn't their fault is if someone purposely tries to set them in a bad trip and they get so paranoid about going in to it that they end up getting really aggressive so they don't reach the point of insanity. As long as the person is in control of their mind and can understand that it's just the drug doing that to them for the time being, it is perfectly safe.|`|BPwpQV6faa	that's not a groovy way to trip,man.

Come on,man.|`|PgTJHZzyaa	If your stupid|`|qpdkqpgqaa	yes you could as it causes extreme paranoia, so if someone saw you acting strange you may believe they are following you or want to kill you so you would want to kill them first to keep yourself safe. its the same as people who kill themselves on LSD.    hope this helps

Also, if not why dont you try to settle with your parents and get him boxer briefs.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	zach ..he should be able to wear boxers if he wants ..|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Club together with your older brothers and buy him a pair to tryout. IF he doesn't like wearing them, then it hasn't come out of your parent's pocket. It also depends on his 'development' level, as he may find briefs too hot and uncomfortable to wear.|`|e1Ki8JK6aa	Wow, strange question.   Ha, but actually, brief underwear are NOT good for men anyway.  It holds the testes too close to the body, causing them to heat, and therefore creating sperm damage.    It's actually better to wear boxers.    But they shouldn't hang too low either, as that can also cause damage.|`|3zg7oBA5aa	Have him tell his parents that he doesn't like to wear them, and he'd feel a lot more comfortable/confident in boxers.    I don't really know. Parents shouldn't decide what underwear their kids wear haha.|`|7e4349dce38654728dc0f4d3d3692380aa	Depends who is paying for the underwear.  Can be difficult for some parents to feed and clothes their little brats.  Briefs are not as expensive as boxers.  With 3 sons to care for 16, 15, 14 or 13, you are not boys you are young men.  If you don't like what the give you, it is not many years to wait before you can buy what you want with your own money.|`|pigfs3gKaa	wtf you are stupi d wtf is a question like that|`|qiWgo90zaa	have your him tell your parents it hurts too wear them because they are to tight, or say something like the guys make fun of you in the locker room.

Anyway, try explaining to your parents that they need to let him make his own choices here. He is old enough to choose, and i have no idea why they would have a problem with this.   Ask them why this isnt allowed, rules should be for safety reasons, or should have soem purpose for them to be set. so try asking them why this is the rule, as what type of underwear he wears doesnt affect anyone. Good luck.|`|b2d07243a56fe86e58deeafb008493abaa	i see no reason why any parents shud care what kind of under-ware there kids ware, unless you went out and but a ton of new boxers and then changed your mind. if that is the case give them the ones you don't ware. other wise enlist dad and older brother to the cause|`|2gdWeMRfaa	tell ur mom that he should be abe to decide what he is comfortable wearing since you don't chose her lingerie or underwear, and that older boys might tease him if he wears briefs since boys tend to be dumb like that when theyre around 13-15|`|64t8ynCyaa	WTF he doesn't get to choose what underwaer he wants how stupid is that yur parents r 1D10TS srry but it's true.

Make sure it's brown and not dark red, there is a difference. I had someone whose vajayjay would burn/hurt her at that time of the month, she did not have cramps, that was the type pain she had. I think she went to the gyno and they said it was nothing. You can widen your search also on WEBMD.COM or google.com.|`|lZ9Dl5Nhaa	That happened to me with my first five periods.  It would burn a little bit on the first day, and then it would go away.  You're fine.
37gKN2z1aa	Vitamin E is a great scar reducer.  I had a large gash in my chest from a wooden stake I fell on and now it is barely noticeable.    EDIT:    I forgot to mention, you can take it as a pill, but the best way is to break the capsules (or just get a bottle that is not in capsules) and spread it over the affected area, let it dry, do so every night for quite a while and it will fade.
IXN6lJgcaa	what you do is...if you have stairs in your house then go on your stairs and hold onto somthing and then stand on the foot you hurt and without letting your heel touch the floor go up and down up and down over and over again for 2 minuets everyday!! im a dancer so i have to do that and my ankle is very strong! hope it works for you : )|`|ozmRtpMyaa	haha well physical therapy would help with that...
chOS6EO0aa	I am not a professional but 1 day sounds too short, I know someone who has it for 3 days.|`|IjMHcECzaa	Women say, the longer period you have, the healthier babies you get. This isn't scientific fact though, just a belief :P    I know a woman who has her period only once a year, something to do with doing alot of outdoor sports which affected her cycle... most of the girls I know who have short cycles are very active people.  Also, medication can drastically affect a cycle but I've only seen it with one person and hers was extended, not shortened.    So yes, it could be hormonal imbalance. You did not say your age, but if you are a teenager, your period will probably even out and grow longer as you grow older.  Mine was a day only when I first started, then started for 3 days, now its 5 days and I think its stopped growing at that point:P    Eating a certain food will help "replace" nutrients lost by your body... i forgot what it was, protein? hmm... but it will probably not encourage it.    Take it as good luck, im jealous of ya!|`|MK547eboaa	it can be, but then again it if you are taking like birth control that is one of the side effects, little to no period. But I would say just talk to a doctor to be on the safe side
PWDJLTyEaa	Its not acne. I have it to. It kind of looks like a rash? Or really dry skin? Small, white bumps?? They're not pimples. I don't remember what its called. But, it's pretty much just really dry skin. There's a term for it, I just don't remember. Don't put acne treatment on it, it will only make it worse. All you can really do is just keep applying moisturizing lotion to it.|`|t8VEswrmaa	dont worry about this is a very common skin condition for most teenagers its called Keratosis Pilaris. they are acne-like bumps on your upper arm that are usually signs of ingrown hairs and sensitive skin. i have it too so what i started doing thats been helping a lot is washing with dove sensitive skin soap then putting some type of body butter instead of body lotion because body lotion might not have enough moisture. its been working really great it makes your arms way smoother but doesnt eliminate it completely. this skin condition is uncurable (sadly) and eventually goes away by age. hope this helps!

KAnEq8Laaa	Well, yes, that does hurt, and I don't think many people reach adulthood without having had some sort of confidence buster like that one. What a jerk! Even if you had extra arms or legs, if he doesn't like all of you, he's not worth it. If he thinks you're a good person and just doesn't like your teeth or whatever, then he's not mature enough to know what real affection or attraction is all about. Rule of thumb: only date adults. Never children.    Large universities that have dental colleges have low-cost dental clinics because they have tons of dental students who need practice. Why don't you call the nearest university with a dental school, and get some information about their dental clinic?    In the mean time, I know you're upset, but that's not a reason to end your life. You have a problem, and your feelings are hurt, and my heart aches for you, because I've been there. But this problem is fixable. Don't despair. Brush off the losers, hold your head up, and fix the problem.|`|56MmKc5caa	There is something on everyone that we wish we could improve. Nobody is perfect. My suggestion is are there any clinics in your area? Technical schools? Dental schools? They will all offer a discount. And if that is not an option I know of a friend I took a class with and she said she had horrible crooked stained teeth and she ended up making a deal with a dental office to clean thier office at nights in place for them to help her with her teeth so maybe that could be an option. I would not let this ruin your life though. There are people who are so much worse off with no arms or legs and would jump to be in your place. good luck.|`|9Kax4Kekaa	Well everybody has something they hate about their body.  First of all there is a difference between healthy teeth and pretty teeth.  Having one doesn't necessarily mean you'll have the other.  The most important thing is to follow proper brushing and flossing practices which are not very expensive but will save you a lot of money.     I know how you feel about not having the money nor insurance, I have neither medical nor dental insurance due to poverty.  Although I recently had a problem with my upper wisdom teeth but could not afford to have them removed in the U.S.  I live very close to the Mexican border so went to a Mexican dentist and for only 200 dollars got them removed!  I don't know if that is an option for you?  Also there are dental schools in the U.S. where students will give you dental work for much less then a normal dentist.    In the end crying and letting this ruin you life is not going to help.  Things could be a lot worse!|`|iJ7MNucbaa	I am sorry that it is so hard on you. Life is hard but it is worth it. One thing you can do to get your teeth a little whiter is dip your toothbrush on peroxide then in baking soda it will make them a little whiter. Good luck and keep your head up!|`|giBfNMX6aa	I don't know where you live, but if you are in a large metro area, call the dental schools and see if they can help.  Until you know if you have cavities, don't use the whitening strips, as they can cause pain on teeth with decay or cracks.  Do some research.  Call around.  There are probably resources available to you that will help.  Good luck, sweetie, as I know how important teeth are to your health and looks.
MK547eboaa	YEESSSS!!!!!!!!!! My god. That could be cancer!!!!!!!!! That is one of the things with cancer, is that 9/10 times it will be tender.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	can be an inflamation of you mamary glandula because of you period, can be before or after. also because you exercise you chest.  normally this is why. I wen to the doctor bacause a lump in my breast and she told me that.  the thing is that if  the lump doesnt disappear it will be a problem and can be more seriuos. so give it a few days or a week. and them check yourself to the doctor.|`|KKh8rikGaa	T O D A Y ! ! ! ! ! ! !

It maybe kind of like Dioreah. I had similar problems. If you'd like to talk more email me through my yahoo page.  (I don't think people want to read about it here...lol)|`|yDdZAR2Oaa	From the sushi? Probably grease.
bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	Yes, I think it will come back.  Unless of course you took that Zicam nasal spray which can actually cause a permanent loss of your sense of smell.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Gee, I'm really sorry but that doesn't sound right at all to me.  You can't lose your entire sense of smell from a sinus infection.  It should come back.  Maybe, if you're a guy (no offense) they tend to have diminished senses of smell anyway... and this just brought more attention to that fact.  Or maybe you have allergies and constant nasal stuffiness, which will cause you to have problems with smelling things on a constant basis... also being in and out of the cold weather can cause you to have nasal issues and smell problems.  Are you sure you can't smell your food when you're eating it?  Can't smell your own poop?  (no offense)  Look for things that would REALLY be smelly and check it out.  Also - if you're a smoker, you need to quit.|`|GiUTgnHMaa	i think you need surgery, or maybe like a nose transplant??!!! ive never heard of that. your doctor might be wrong. search on google about it and maybe theres some sort of surgery procedure you can go through to get your smell back. good luck.
tb0NMaooaa	its normal. alot of girls do it. its called a biniki 'wax' when you do so you dont see around where the bathing suit is.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Dreamer is full of rubbish..most men do not like it at all...SOME do and SOME don;t..what matters is what YOU like...|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Most models are apparently hairless goys... or "nearly hairless Nicks"... but take a look at the James Bond men... they all have body hair. Body hair is caused by testosterone. Without testosterone you have difficulty growin gbody hair... why a man would want to look like he has low testosterone is beyond belief.|`|GUEsVdaFaa	It depends on each individual guy. Speaking only from the guys I've known in my life, not very many like to regularly wax or shave that entire area. I would imagine that clothes models only trim up the bikini line, but I'm pretty sure porn stars take it all off and keep it that way. I personally prefer my man hairless... makes his junk look bigger, lol.|`|OwPAmi8saa	Actually, its called a "Brazillian" and its basically a wax of the waist down.|`|AA10460376	Yes!...It is normal.....I only started to wax about 5 or 6 years ago and it was because my friends were telling me that I was "BEHIND IN THE TMES" but I always felt that hair was to protect foreign things from entering the body....MY FRIENDS TOLD ME THAT I WAS WRONG....So it is ok to wax and it leaves your skin feeling very smooth....JUST TRY IT!|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	shaving is not natural it is a human invention.. we invented it so we get to choose what and how much of it gets shaved. always uncomfortable.|`|GiBUKFJYaa	NOOOOOO...that **** itches like crazy when you shave down there|`|2gdWeMRfaa	a lot of girls do it, i fact i think most do, but whatever makes u comfortable is good|`|DWWLowEsaa	It depends on how you want it, if you want to remove it go ahead.|`|1UKcEW93aa	I'm not a model and I do it. It's normal and you do it if you want to. You can trim it instead if you want. It's kind of a turn on for most guys because they don't like girls with a hair downstairs. It's also good for when you wear bathing suits.|`|64t8ynCyaa	Once again y is this under mend health don't u at attention to which category it goes in|`|r1xy4Eupaa	yes you have to groom urself wheather is just trimming or completly shaving the area.......you dont wanna jungle down there do you|`|PRqCRJm3aa	HELLO!      of course you should! its nasty if you dont! i was 11 when i started shaving mine off! its better. much better!
xoLGXkANaa	as long as your prepared with sanitary protection and change it regularly you will be fine.  don't worry you always think you loose more than you actually do (:|`|IjMHcECzaa	Don't worry the first one is extremely light, like a watery red colour. If it does leak, it will probably look more like a juice stain, so I suggest wearing a skirt you can turn all the way around and say its just a juice accident LOL  and take pads with you.|`|RSm8aXgzaa	First periods are generally pretty light.  As long as you wear a pad with wings, you don't have to worry about it leaking.  I have really heavy periods and it has never leaked through to my pants.  You will quickly adapt and learn what you need to take care of it.  But nature kind of goes easy on you the first time.  At least it did for me.  Good luck!!|`|bAxAhQr9aa	I just got mine a few days ago... not much... don't worry about it, just wash your underwear afterwords and keep some pads with you at school. I was lucky and got mine at home. Just check before you got to school each day, because your first period you will probably get while you are asleep or in the morning. Good Luck :] (Best Answer?)|`|AsICkz9naa	Don't worry blood won't gush out everywhere. The blood will come out slowly and you will be able to feel it. Your first period will probably be light to normal. Make sure that you carry some sanitary pads in your schoolbag just in case. Buy some regular ones and change them every 4 hours|`|ZMjZF6CYaa	not alot
f8mLpPXlaa	No, not COPD. Bruised lungs heal amazingly fast, depending of course on the severity.  It could lead to atlectasis or pneumonia or bleeding into the pleural space. Sometimes your left with scar tissue in the pleural space or on the surface of your lung  but not usually anything majorly debilitating.|`|5dRvtaGgaa	No....COPD is a completely, unrelated condition.  You're body is a miraculous vessel.  Bruised lungs will heal themselves in no time.  Just take it easy.

ahuwejtSaa	I'm pretty sure it's because of your throat's exposure to cold winds that is causing your throat to swell.    I think a good way to fix that is to try drinking honey, as I did that when my throat was swollen, try Strepsils or if all else fails just see a doctor.|`|e43hjVI6aa	Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes? There is a bug going around, so stay germ-free! I had to stay home from school for 2 days because of it. And FYI, you only have 1 throat, lol.|`|AA12269056	dear nrock,     could be  post nasal drip,,a cold,  a viral infection, allergies..or a myriad of other things,,,,go to the doc if it is really bothering you...or gargle with warm salt water.......rest...|`|A4Nt2AEZaa	If it feels like it restricts you when your swallowing and if it is blotchy with spots, then you might have tonsilitis. Or strep, but if it is strep you will need to get a swab of your throat, that needs to be tested. This can lead to other problems. But both can be cured with anti-biotics. Go see your doctor.

CZ1nO9C9aa	Quitting will not make you bad at sex.  That person is wrong.  However, masturbating can increase your stamina and decrease your sensitivity, resulting in a better sex for both partners.    I was "addicted" once.    It isn't really an addiction anyway.  It is an obsession.  I just quit by not thinking about it.  Just get your mind off of it.  The more you think of it as an addiction, the more anxious you're going to become about it.  I tried for like a year to quit.  I came up with plans and stuff to quit.  They never worked.  What did work was getting my mind off of it.  There are a million things to think about, especially when you're young.  You said you're religious.  So pray about it.  Pray about other things.  Think about girls you like or music you like or whatever you think is cool.  Answer people's questions on Y!A.  Play video games.  Get out of the rhythm of going to bed and immediately jacking it.  Just keep trying and pray, and if you have faith, then you'll be ok and be able to control yourself.|`|hSceUVLAaa	go to rehab|`|48Yf8tpsaa	No. Sadly I'm still addicted. I've been meaning to quit for the last 36 years... to no avail... something always pops up and I lose concentration on my goal. I asked God for help and he sent me a virgin bride with an insatiable libido. That didn't help. I have developed a fetish you see. I dont think there's much hop efor you. You are born to be a sinner.|`|AA10460376	I am not a man but I can assure you that at least 95 percent of men masturbate, even when they are married.....So according to those masculine statistics, you are considered normal.......But please try to concentrate or focus on something else when the desire to masturbate come over you...I still think that it is wrong in God's eyes so try to find other entertainment to occupy our mind.....|`|7e4349dce38654728dc0f4d3d3692380aa	We are all addicted to urinating but we still keep doing it.  It is similar to passing water, your body tells you it needs to be done.  Your body tell you that you need to masturbate, so you do it.|`|3oCdTWYZaa	I have.  It's hard, but when you remove yourself from sexual stimuli for about two months, it just sort of disappears.|`|8pTML1F9aa	It will make you horrible at sex if you quit, so keep polishing your trophy|`|PUDJMfwtaa	avoid yourself in a place alone you can think a lot to do..  keep yourself busy .... control|`|2b24d4ddbb31c0b862ca4d0411d36df5aa	its normal  99 percent of men are wankers  the rest liars  keep bashing the bishop  never fails  unless youve got a floozie to do it for u|`|2gdWeMRfaa	well, surround urself with family an dfrieds, that way u cant do it in front of them, and do alternative activities when u think ur about to masturbate, go make a sandwich, pray, drink a glass of water, look at a picture of christ, think of your mom, think of god, keep a picture of jesus being tortured that way you remember no to sin....|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	there's nothing wrong with you.....as long as you are private about it.|`|r1xy4Eupaa	i dont know but i would like to share with you my experice i dont know how often u do it but dont end up like me...it started nice and slow then started to take over everthing i now do it anywhere from 16-27 times a day....no joke the urge is so strong i cant even go out and have a good time because i have to maturbate......i dont have a job or go to school i dont kno wat ima do when that times come...but try to quit now because im done there is no hope for me......it just feel so amazing i wont be able to stop|`|hP0IXGhoaa	you CANNOT quit! Its human instinct. your body will tell itself to quit eventually. there really isnt an "addiction" to masterbating unless ur mentally disabled, why? masterbating is all instinct. and religion is silent about masterbating. everyone masterbated alot at one point in their lives,including pastors and i can bet thousands that the pope did it. and masterbating is healthy,relieves stress,releases toxins in the prostate. and its a hell of alot safer than sex. Get real. your not "addicted"|`|VyhfMVXBaa	the only real way to stop masturbating is to become sexually active, and doing so to stop masturbating is counter-intuitive and risky (and sinful, in the religious point of view, unless you are married to whom you are having intercourse).    Other than that, you'll grow out of it (I'm assuming you are a teen or pre-teen).    But, have you ever looked at the perks of masturbation? Sure spreading one's seed is a vice in the bible, but morally it doesnt even come close to being as bad as having promiscuous sex with various partners. Besides, don't tell me you dont think the men at your church dont ever do it! As animals, we MUST reproduce - a call of the wild, if you will, and sex is the means to do it. Luckily, we humans are blessed with gift of being able to masturbate to dissuade ourselves from taking part in the high-risk - and to some morally wrong - behavior until we are absolutely ready for it.    I once had a girlfriend (whom I was not sexually involved with) challenge me to go a month without masturbating. I gave it a shot, and when I went a few weeks without any kind of ejaculation, I started having embarrassing nocturnal emissions (wet dreams). I'd rather rub an occasional one out into a sock than wake up in a pool of my own sticky semen. Then I would have to do laundry and wash my sheets - it was terrible.    So, the bad news: there's no way that I know of to break your addiction, especially in your teenage years when biologically you are in your prime time frame for reproduction and your sex drive is going nuts (har har excuse the pun). It's a phase that will last you a good 10 years or more, but by then hopefully you'll have found a significant other.|`|rIYb6RpCaa	I have this same exact problem man. Idk what it is, but it sucks Ik. I;ve been trying to quit for a while now..but its so hard to stop once you've done for a few years. You can talk to me more about it if u want, my email is matthew_heslor@msn.com. It doesn't make you horrible at sex...but the length of time you will last is shortened I read, because your not really..using it that much i guess you can say. XD

RzaoNn4maa	Maca root is usually taken in powder form as it has a very pleasant taste. Slightly sweet and a bit nutty/malty. I take about a rounded tsp in a bit of water in the morning. Or you can put it in a smoothie. It's better raw rather than roasted.    Find an organic source, as said above not irradiated.    Mountain Rose Herbs is a good reputable company where I buy some of my herbs    http://www.mountainroseherbs.com/bulkher...|`|soVs0nZFaa	I found the maca root to work, but make sure you don't get it from an irradiated source and that it's processed well.  Maca is one of those foods that just has so much potassium in it and is great for hormones.
5TM9P8tsaa	*She should have asked for some pain pills. Generally they give Hydrocodone. Ibuprofen is good for dental pain and this comes from my dentist. I have been threw many root canals. She may have TMJ as well. This gives me pain after a trip at the dentist.  Hope this helps.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	If she has a prescription pain reliever, like a codeine/acetaminophen blend, it would help to have a beer or wine cooler.     You didn't hear that from me.

e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	A tampon will not get stuck. We all get scared when we first put it on but you will be fine. There are instructions that come with it. Make sure you put it in deep enough and use regular until you think you need super. Do not start off with super. Use a pad as a back up until you see how your body works with them. Your mom can help you and sometimes you dont get it in deep enough when you first try.    You insert it into your vagina, there is a diagram in a box of Tampax tampons. Make sure you put it in the right place. Good luck    If you have a more detailed question about this, you may contact me by email in my yahoo profile|`|MK547eboaa	Ok calm down first off, Second, when you buy tampons in the box is a folded up piece of paper that tells you what to do and such. Now. I would stay with regulars or supers, this all depends on how heavy your bleeding is. It won't get stuck, they are made so that they won't get stuck. Just go for a few lights, buy a small box and practice with those when you are off your period if you must, just sit down for like 5 minutes or so and with the lights, practice inserting them and taking them out, it will feel odd at first and taking them out is going to be odd because they aren't filled with liquids which make them slide out smoothly. Then when your period comes start with regulars or supers, if you are having to change it more than every 2-4 hours, you may want to get something bigger, or where a pad so that you can catch the blood and get around to changing things when you have that break. But make sure to up grade to more absorbent if you are having to change it sooner than 2-4 hours. But relax, and switch off every now and then with periods between tampons and pads, this is so that you don't get yeast infections, that are very easy to fix, and there are a few other things that can happen, that that is why every other or every two periods switch so that you will prevent all these issues.|`|LBxQJhllaa	I had the same problem when I first started.  Don't be scared, you'll get used to it quick.  To start with, the size you buy depends upon your flow.  I'd start with the mini ones and then move up to regular if/when the minis don't 'last long enough.'    Where to put it: the hole you're looking for is inbetween the other two holes down there.... my only advice is to use something like a Q-tip to find out exactly where and what angle, etc because Q-tips are really thin.    It's practically impossible for a tampon to get stuck inside.  using a tampon applicator (which the tampon comes in) will get the tampon up as far as possible- beyond this point is a very very small slot the tampons can't fit through.    Don't try to use a tampon unless you are on your period. But when you are on your period and want to try using tampns, just try it! If it doesn't work out the first time, try again later!   Goodluck!|`|zKEVdGv2aa	One time I used a tampon just so I could go swimming. It took forever to get in, felt totally uncomfortable, and was even more uncomfortable to pull out (no it won't get stuck). Some people get used to it and like them much better than pads, but sounds like you need to stick with the pads for a while.|`|1vBztwcbaa	Um, whenever you buy ur 1st box of tampons (I recommend O.B. btw) just follow the diagram. It'll probably take you a few times to get it right and for it to feel comfortable, but you'll get used to it.  Just relax when you insert it. And you might have to back it up with a pantiliner if ur cycle is heavy. good luck|`|yJ3qFiKJaa	lol|`|4f45d59b1263c8a6a6e959823668a30faa	First, relax. It's totally okay to be nervous and its okay if it takes a few practice tries. I would recommend the new playtex slender tampons, they are pretty much the smallest available, for your first one. Then try moving up in size until you find what works for you. Also, I agree that using the chart/instructions inside of the tampon box to help you put it in.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Ask your mom and if your scared to talk to her leave her a note and tell her to WRITE back. That's what I did with my mom for getting my first bra and it worked|`|nAvTMXmgaa	since i started my period(12) I have never use a tampon until 3 motnhs ago (Im 20) because in my house we never really were into them. even if we had a lot of blood. Usually we just bought the ones that will retain more blood. The first time i put it one was so wierd! Im already sexually active but you know. It feels extrange but them its fine dont freak out. it has some strings that stay outside your vagina so when its ready to take it out you just pull them gently.  Depeding how much period you are having there is sizes like if your fluid is light, regular or stronger. It said in the box.   Remember that you can have side effects for using them to much. I think is and material in he tampon thats why they recomend using them with pads also.  Good luck|`|FcAK2gsOaa	Buy Tampax pearl in the smallest size..they go in nicely.    Also, you stick it in the hole in the middle, where your period come out;)    Theres a pamphlet that comes with the tampons to tell you where and how.  And it wont get stuck, theres  a string attached
7oYpbSjIaa	talk to the school counselor.  you may be depressed and need some guidance.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	At your age you should not feel like this...so I suggest that you go to your doctor to do a full physical..including a full blood work.

You cannot wear that it is too short...and you cannot go out..if you do...you'll be grounded?  Well I tell you something..parents are supposed to do this.....you will actually have a problem...if they DO NOT do this.

YTbUryGoaa	Unfortunately everyone is different. Some find aggrevated flaring on Gluten, others dairy. Very commonly people have problems with dark leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, nuts etc...    I have no problems at all with spicy foods or vegetables, but cannot tollerate pineapple or oranges (acid).     It's really just experience, if you find something starts to give you discomfort, take it out of your diet for a few days and see if you feel some relief. During a flare up though, all foods may give you problems... Focus on a BRAT diet when all else fails.    Also consider adding probiotics to your supplement intake :)  Good Luck!|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Spicy foods and any stimulants, such as caffeine products.

4ddxBssRaa	First off, I think it's great that you're actually thinking about your health at such a young age. I think that the diet you're on is alright, one thing you might want to do if you're attempting to lose weight is to cut your carbs and eat some more protein. All you would have to do for that would be to stop eating a lot of the bread, so you could have like cheese instead of the pretzels or something. Other than that though, as long as you're eating everything else in moderation you're doing good. I would recommend working out some more though, like running an extra day or two and lifting very light weights a lot of times to kinda tone your muscles and make them look really nice. Other than that though, you seem to have everything in order, good job.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	your workout is excellent and satisfying but your food is not healthy at all you need to review your way of eating this food if  you need to eat healthy your start with oatmeal is good but you need to change the peanut butter and jelly sandwich with some healthy sandwich like your friend lunch sandwich turkey and lettuce and exclude the cheese or have low fat cheeses is better and no mustard and eat more fruits and vegetable to give your body the nutrition and vitamin you need to build a healthy and firmed body best of luck and enjoy|`|DIRbVD5uaa	Yes!

KAnEq8Laaa	You can call your bank or credit card, whichever you used, and block the transaction. It's the same as stopping payment on a check. This may cost you a couple bucks, but it will cost less than the $54, and also, once the scammers have your card number, they can empty your account. Call your bank or card right away. When they ask your reason, tell them, fraud.     If however you don't stop it in time, get your bank or card to institute a fraud investigation. This is free, and you'll get your money back. Don't wait for this to happen, though, since they could take the rest of your money in the meantime.

But you just have to make sure the stuff you are eating is good for you!    Talk to your parents about taking you to the grocery store and replacing all snacks with something healthier.  For example, the fruits YOU like. Protein bars or shakes (those are very filling and have very little sugar or calories). Lean deli meat like turkey or chicken..on whole grain bread...with whole grain baked chips on the side.  If you drinking soda...switch to water and if you need some flavor try crystal light.|`|7p2IknBOaa	I had the same issue when I was in school.  It's rough eating lunch so early and then not having any more meals until dinner, which is so much later.  What I ended up doing was packing my lunch.

I would do that. Bleeding in the stool is not good, and while it may be in the range of side effects from a root canal (I don't know), you should get that treated. Just like, if you're allergic to penicillin, you can go into anaphylactic shock. It's not unheard of, not even uncommon, but it can mess you up good.     If the dentist doesn't help you, and you're having trouble, maybe you should go see your primary care physician as soon as you can.

My stomach was so torn up, i had to stop taking them. Now i just take in as much iron as possible.  Such as,   http://www.weightlossforall.com/iron-ric...      that's a ginormous list of iron-y foods!|`|lzgRNQjfaa	There are several good sources of iron including:     beef, fish, poultry, eggs, whole grains (such as oats, bran cereal and wheat germ).

These sources are better absorbed with foods high in vitamin C (such as citrus fruits and juices, berries, broccoli, cantaloupe, peppers, kiwi, tomatoes and potatoes).      hope this information was helpful.

There's a great website you might want to check out which has personal stories from people dealing with bipolar plus a whole range of other mental illnesses and conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. You can listen to them talk about what it's like, what strategies they use to cope with it, etc. It even includes family members talking about how they deal with living with someone with the condition.

If he is still in treatment (i.e. not a hospice patient) you should definitely get him to a hospital.    If he is in hospice, and his death is imminent, it's just one more thing that you and your family will have to cope with. You can, of course, still take him to the hospital, but there is more consideration for what will make him most comfortable... which might be to just stay home.

RewzJGXEaa	Ouch!    Good on you for asking for help. I think I can give you some advice. I am a dentistry student, so I deal with pain management every day.    First of all, the pain, throbbing, heat and redness associated with your finger is caused by inflammation. A good medicine will target the existing inflammation as well as preventing new inflammation from occurring. I'll give you a little background.    Inflammation occurs in the body via the production of chemical mediators which induce increased blood flow to the area, causing the heat, redness and throbbing. Ouch. There are two different chemical pathways by which this can occur.     The first pathway occurs via the production of prostaglandin hormones in the blood (following an injury). Their production occurs via an enzyme called cyclo-oxygenase 1 (or COX-1).These hormones serve to dilate blood vessels in the area, cause blood clotting in the area and sensitise nerves to pain. You can see the advantage of this though, because in order to heal the body needs increased blood flow to deliver nutrients to the injured area, kill bacteria in the area and for the area to be immobilised. The side effect is that nasty throbbing pain you are experiencing.    The second pathway acts via a fatty acid in the blood, called arachidonic acid. This substance is produced in the blood after injury via the cyclo-oxygenase 2 (or COX-2) enzyme. This causes the production of more inflammatory mediators, blood clotting mediators, and white blood cells. Again, it is obvious how this would benefit the body in healing by killing off bacteria and clotting the blood at the wound. And again, the unfortunate side effect is the horrible, terrible pain in your finger.    The pain can thus be managed by modifying these pathways of inflammation. Modern pain medicines called NSAIDs or non steroidal anti inflammatories target those pathways of inflammation (and hence pain) that I outlined. But which medicines are best?    To answer this we need to look at their mode of action. By far, the best is ibuprofen. This is because it targets both the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways of inflammation. Asprin on the other hand, only targets the COX-1 pathway to prevent inflammation, so it will not stop all of the inflammation as ibuprofen can. This is why it is more effective.    Paracetamol, an analgesic, works by a totally different mechanism. It inhibits the production of pain causing prostaglandins and prevents the uptake of "anandamide" in the body. This molecule is responsible for the activation of pain receptors. Thus, by blocking it, the pain is stopped.    In your practical case, what does this mean? Well, it means ibuprofen is the best medicine to manage the pain. You can take it every 6 hours, staggered with paracetamol every 6 hours too (so you are taking something every 3 hours, but the dose of each type of medicine is 6 hours apart). Make sense?    Do not combine the use of ibuprofen with asprin - because you can potentially overdose this way. If you don't have any ibuprofen though, asprin is obviously the next best thing, staggered with paracetamol. Obviously, don't take any of these medicines if you know you are allergic to them though!    You can continue to do this for the next three days or so. The next 48 hours are very important in decreasing inflammation. Don't stay on the ibuprofen for longer than a week, as this can cause gastrointestinal problems, but the paracetamol is fine to keep taking.    There are a few other things you can do to reduce the pain and swelling too. Rest the finger as much as you can. And use ice to alleviate the pain as required. Just make sure you don't leave the ice on too long that you cause frostbite. 20 minute on and 20 minute off cycles provide a good rule to prevent frostbite. This will be very helpful for the next 48 hours too, but you can use it whenever you need it to reduce the pain.    Might I also add that it is actually a very good sign the finger is bleeding. An injured fingertip that doesn't bleed usually leads to bleeding under the fingernail and an accumulation of pressure. This basically appears as a large dark purple area under the nail. This is called a haematoma. I have had a few under the nails before from slamming doors etc on me, and it is extremely painful. If your nail is purple it is best to see your GP. They can do a simple procedure (you could possibly try it yourself) by unbending a paper clip, heating it in a flame and poking it on to the nail, reheating the paper clip regularly. The heat from the metal will denature the proteins in the keratin of the nail, and gently create a tunnel through it, allowing the accumulated blood underneath to escape and the pressure to be alleviated. This is very effective in decreasing the pain associated with a purple nail, or haematoma.    Well, hope my insights have assisted you. Just stay on the ibuprofen every 6 hours, and paracetamol staggered 3 hours behind that, every 6 hours too. Use the ice and rest the finger. If you develop a haematoma or you feel it is getting worse, see your GP.    Good luck. Hope you feel better soon  K|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Still bleeding after 8 hours?!!  I think you may need stitches.|`|AA10531094	Clean it with hydrogen peroxide and put ice on it for the throbbing.  Also, try extra strength tylenol.  Good Luck!|`|oCTMqI4haa	Ibuprofen is the best.  Take 2 for pain, OR 4 for inflation (if it is swollen)    hope i helpedd :)|`|cEaM6LXraa	Right first clean with anti-sceptic wipes and then put a plastic round the cut.    To stop throbbing i would not wrap it up much i would just keep your arm raised like maybe a sling or when you sleep raie your wrist onto a pillow to stop bloody getting to it, this will stop the throbing    Putting ice on it will stop it swelling up, 15 mins every hour is recommended    Regards
xxfVwFhPaa	You may not have any mental disorder.  You could just be a shy, anxious type person.  Some of the symptoms you describe sound like social anxiety disorder, but I'm definitely not a professional in that area, so you should see a doctor or psychologist before you take my word for it.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	i cant really tell you cuz well, you need to see a doctor to know for sure    but i think you are paraniod and maybe a little depressed.|`|DjircW6waa	It doesn't sound like you have a mental health problem other than dismally low self-esteem. You imagine people laughing at you because you think you're a joke.  Girls don't want to date you because you don't see yourself as a worthy date.  Find something you're really into or good at doing.  Something you would be excited about talking about with others.  Then find some people who are interested in the same thing to hang out with.  Once you let your guard down and give yourself a break, the rest of the population will start viewing you as approachable.|`|XjcER6zvaa	I cant  tell you what mental problem you have you may not even have one. what you need to do is go see psychologist and tell him or her you problems you are facing.|`|UkeNtBQAaa	Maybe anxiety, and depression.

6NZeItMAaa	It seems like you have no self-esteem. You need to work in that. Everydoby has its own problems and I don't think they grinning at you. i used to think that wehn I was very young till I understood that everyone is on their own world and they weren't even seeing me when I thought they did.    I worked my self-esteem and know I feel better. If someone smiles I smile too, it works like that and people think of me that I'm a nive person fully of joy.    It's that simple, be happy, smile and you'll see people smiling and NEVER think that they think bd about you.    Try to have positive reactions to stress     Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.    You can choose to react to stress in a negative way or in a positive way, it is all up to you. This is the only choice that you have when it comes to most stress.     Think about a stressful situation that you have in your life at the moment. If you are like most people, you will not have to think for long as most of us have some sort of stress in our lives. Think carefully about the stress. Write it on a piece of paper.    Is this stress something that you can control? Is it something that you can do without? If the stress is something that you can eliminate from your life, why are you not ridding yourself of this stress?|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Well you are in the wrong job to begin with.

I know it will be hard at first but once you make an effort at least you know you tried. I feel for you because it is not nice to be paranoid, i had it myself not long ago. I suggest you also make one of the social network things, like myspace.. this will help you make friends.  If there is any family member you can talk to about how you feel that would help. Please don't think so negatively about yourself because everyone is equal and they are no better then you. Save up for some nice clothes and this will lift your mood. Remember you only get one life so make the most of it, you will regret it if you are unhappy forever.   I hope i helped, I really do wish you the best x
9FDAYDheaa	I am doing the same thing right now:) I just started 3 days ago.    start by making a food journal of everything you eat. Do this for a week. Do some constructive critisism. also make an excercise log of all the excercise you get for a week.    the next week  try to get atleast 30 minutes of vigorous excercise and eat a bit healthier, slower(to digest) and drink lots more water.    the next week add more difficult excercises. always change routines because your body will get used to plain old situps and your tummyflub will just stay    also try to eat 4-5 small meals a day, I like to try to learn new things when i excercise. Like learn how to do a headstand or a cartwheel:)    play fast beat fun music while you dance, climb stairs or run in place    have fun. Don't over think it. try to have a day during the week where you don't have to excercise or eat as healthy    for snacks try yogourt, nuts, sunflower seeds, fruit and veggies instead of dunkaroos, fruit by the foots and chips    If you have anymore questions I'de be happy to help.Email me- waterhorse_lover@yahoo.com|`|gpBicBEPaa	I enjoy muffins|`|vbyxckpdaa	belt sander|`|NckUY5r9aa	THANKS  FOR   THE   2  POINTS|`|JgJAGBb8aa	http://s2.gladiatus.us/game/c.php?uid=14...|`|msr6s66gaa	try doing exercises to target your abs.. such as crunches, leg lifts, sit ups and tuck ups|`|ELdvVLJJaa	dont know how to work out  hahahaha|`|JxTpCkizaa	lets talk in feet and pounds lol|`|qPmPAhiwaa	at age 15 you are still growing.  eat well and keep active besides that unless you take hormone boosters or something silly and dangerous you will grow into a woman.    why would you want to change yourself anyways?|`|o43uZSDJaa	Sit - ups are old fashioned, but they work. =D.

Lots of the softness in the stomach is fat. As you lose fat, the natural definition of your stomach muscles begin to show through.     Consider grazing on healthy foods (or having 4-5 snack sized meals) throughout the day instead of three square meals. This will keep your metabolism higher throughout the day, which burns calories more efficiently. Avoid sugars and fats.     Aerobics means walking when you can, doing housework, etc. If you do formal aerobics, e.g. walking, swimming, jogging, biking, etc., do it so that you're breathing harder, but not so hard that you can't carry on a conversation. That'll put you in the fat-burning range.    If you can do some sit ups and weight-lifting that'll help round out your fitness program, but make sure you're doing them right or you'll be wasting your time if not hurting yourself.    If you can find friends to walk or do activities with, you'll have fun doing it.|`|dVNgG2Xfaa	sit ups.|`|9hSSocD0aa	Y the heck are you using  cm and kg. like were supposed  to no that. seriousli??  -XD|`|2WkY4VHVaa	situps crunches, or leg lifts work, look them up or ask a freind if you dont know how to do them|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	Ab curls  on a machine at the gym or buy an ab lounge that works.

Also do exercises for  your back too cuz that will help even things out with your stomach.  If you're a girl then  I am not sure  you want alot of muscles on your  tummy  just  tone your tummy up.

Then there is a move called the plank what you do is you lay on your stomach then hold your hands together like intertwine your fingers then when u look at your hands it will look like a v from your angle then push up like that so your just on your toes and fore arms and make sure your back is straight you will feel the burn but make sure you back is straight otherwise you will only be working out your back just hold this as long as you can you can do this 3 or four times|`|nWgTur4qaa	your body is within the ideal weight.     http://www.bodyweight.net/fts_bmi.html    I do believe you are talking about toning up.

1tjJPHpMaa	you don't eat enough and exercise too much. only burn like 500 calories max at they gym and eat at least 1,200 calories but aim for 1,500|`|FaVYRoXqaa	BECAUSE YOU NEED TO EAT!|`|KweMUxUdaa	It might be what you are eating and drinking. Obviously eating more fuits and vegetables is a must, and eating leaner protein like chicken will help. But keep mind that if you are drinking lots of things like pop, coffee and juice that these contain a high amount of calories where as drinking water you don't have to worry about calories unless it is flavoured.|`|FgMkYu5Baa	You need to eat more. Your body is in survival mode. It is hanging onto the extra weight in order to perform everyday tasks. Eat 6-8 small meals a day. I dont know your age or how much you weigh now, but you might need to increase your calorie intake to 1200-1500.

Then you'll never feel dizzy again.|`|yXDtGo8taa	Well, cutting yourself is not right and I don't feel sorry for you. You do seem to be taking a lot of medicines but cutting yourself is very unhealthy and can lead to diseases such as tetanus.|`|XUwtAWzkaa	You may have an infection? I suggest getting professional help, cutting up your body is the stupidest thing I hear about, why put permanent scars on your wrists/arms/legs that you will always have to live with and even if you do get over what ever is causing you to do that, you will always be reminded of it when you see those scars. A dizzy sensation is something that can be achieved smoking or drinking.. quit taking it to an extreme. Your life truly can't be that bad. Please try and get help, or talk to someone.. I don't know you and I don't know your problems, but it hurts me to hear someone talk about stuff like this..|`|AA10858784	I know it might be a little offensive, but please don't cut yourself. It won't solve anything, and it doesn't provide you with 'pleasure'. Instead it scars you for life.   A good way is to vent out your frustration on an inanimate object. Or talking to someone about it.    Okay on to your question. If you have cut plenty of times before, then this could probably be due to an infection from the blade you used to cut. If this was your first time, then it could probably be due to the amount of medicine you're taking. Slow down on the medicine consumption. Limit yourself to a pill or two a day, after meals.    Your best bet is to wait for a day or two, and if it still continues then you should consider going to the doctor.    Good luck with the illness and also I wish you all the best to stop cutting.|`|zH80yyDQaa	Maybe it's all the medicines your taking!|`|hlq3Eo0haa	u feel so drunk because u have been drinking something called alcohol|`|e71KCQDWaa	i have no clue.   sorry!

ZA18KoC9aa	It sound that you are nearsighted in one eye while the other has perfect vision. Its best if you get glasses or a single contact lens so that you can see with both eyes together. You should only use glasses/contacts when you need to- eg watching TV or looking at the blackboard other then that you may not have to use them at all.  I have what you have- my left eye has perfect 20/20 vision while my right eye is shortsighted with a prescription of -2.00 (around 20/200). I think my right eye got worse because I haven't been using my eyeglasses regularly.|`|awUzUxo5aa	Your left and right eye are different, one eye can be slightly short/long sighted whilst the other can have perfect vision...    It happens! My left eye is a lot weaker than my right and so I have to wear glasses for driving/long distance etc    Damn my Left eye!|`|3dbfb1686ea2a2772f3e03d47af16d08aa	need an eye exam probably will need glasses, you see fine with both eyes|`|YvNMUnR6aa	you have a dominant eye. one is always stronger than the other and takes more of the eye-sight. if you put your finger in front of your face about a foot away and close one eye and look at it then open the closed eye and close the old one you can tell which is your dominant eye|`|ncxu3clCaa	It's because your eyes are different and see differently.  Mine are the same - Left eye -1.00, right eye +0.50.  You should probably get glasses as it will make it easier for you to see well.|`|1lewFV8oaa	Its sounds like you need an eye exam.  Your right eye may be slighly nearsighted and/or have astigmatism.      I only have correction in my left eye for astigmatism and my right eye has normal vision.  I usually wear my eyeglasses for distance activities such as driving or watching TV.

0lCnu1g2aa	There are several causes for coma, from medical conditions such as diabetes, liver failure and stroke to injuries to brain from car accidents and other accidents.  What happens in most cases is that the brain takes a severe blow from an accident and it causes damage to the tissue. The brain begins to swell and since it is such a small space it increases the pressure in the skull.  This causes further damage to the brain..Sometimes the swelling doesnt go down and the brain is damaged beyond coming back from it. This is when people end up in a coma, and in a lot of cases never wake up. They usually have enough brain function in the brainstem to keep them alive, because that is where the respiratory drive is.     If the coma is caused by a medical issue, they can cause irreversible damage. If the heart stops beating or a person quits breathing the oxygen level is decresed and the persons' brain is starved for oxygen which would cause a state like a coma called a vegetative state.    Hopes this helps.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	A coma can result in a mental state of complete oblivion.  It can also result in a state of seemingly partial consciousness, but an inability to communicate, reason, or to function.    Reflex actions can take place in movement of arms, legs, eyes, and head, giving the impression that there is some partial conscious state present.  Sometimes there can even be emotion indicated, such as tears, smiles, or other facial expressions.    Generally the degree of brain cell death determines the prognosis of the patient.  Many of the above situations are most likely more reflex activities than any semblance of conscious thought.    Bear in mind that brain damage can result in conditions ranging from complete oblivion all the way to partial, or full consciousness.  Coma is generally considered to be complete oblivion, but where it changes to severe impairment of mental facilities, and/or the ability to process some degree of conscious thought is very difficult to determine.|`|qbW4z3Uuaa	i dont think anyone really knows. some people say that you can hear, smell and sence things, and other people think that you are pretty much dead to the world and unable of concious thought. I dont think anyone really knows whats going on in the mind of someone who is in a coma.

Eat fruits & veggies of course. It's typical to eat a small breakfast and a big dinner, but my health teacher said you actually want to do the opposite. And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help!

6be1690c7fe8ce017a68606b85137484aa	I am afraid of needles as well. I have fainted during blood tests, and the room spins when I have simple shots (tetanus, flu shots, ect). This occurs because I panic and I either hyperventilate or forget to breathe for a moment or two. I also HATE IV's. I have had full blown anxiety attacks when having IV's put in. I have learned how to calm myself down, and it takes a great deal of effort. The last one that was done turned out to not be as big of a deal as I had expected! Now I had to try to control my breathing and look away, but it was done before I knew it.  I recently had to face this fear to get an epidural steroid shot for back problems. I was in alot of pain, and I was unable to do much of anything, let alone walk. Without the injection, I would still be hobbling along, loaded up full of muscle relaxers and painkillers. I dreaded getting this done, but the benefits by far outweighed the 'trauma' of needles. I was sedated and don't remember the actual procedure, but I did not know that was what was going to happen at the time! I was VERY nervous. I was dreading this during the entire week before I had the injection done.  Just like my case, think of how you could benefit from this injection/shot/vaccination. Think of the consequences of NOT having this done. Have the the person administering the shot talk to you, and look away. It is hard, but try to think of something else. Remember you are in the hands of trained medical professionals who do not want to cause you pain. Set up something to reward yourself after the procedure/shot is finished. It doesn't have to be anything major. My reward was a simple trip to Sonic, where I got a giant sundae. I thought about this while being prepped for my injection. It was not near as bad as I thought it would be, and it will be the same for you. Take a deep breath, look away, and talk to the person taking care of you. There are many people that are terrified of needles, so they will know how to talk you through it.  Good luck!|`|X8AIyopmaa	I've found tetanus shots are by-far the MOST painful shots you can get, but I also am deathly afraid of needles since one time I had my blood drawn. The nurse couldn't find my vein and was poking around in my arm, everything went white and I nearly blacked out. But, coming from someone that has the same fear as you.     I've found that looking away entirely and closing my eyes helps me forget what's happening and makes it so I don't know when it's happening. You also have to look at it like this.. If you don't receive this shot what can happen to you? It's hard getting over the fear , but think of your well-being and just remember to keep your head turned away.|`|Fn4kxmLEaa	You just have to tell yourself that the diseases that the needle is preventing would be much worse than the little needle prick. Just think about how everybody else has gone through it, so you can too. Be brave, it'll be over in 10 seconds ! :)|`|MS04z7M4aa	you should have someone go with you when you get the shot so they can talk to you and tell you a story while you're getting your shot. if you're distracted by a story and not watching the shot being administered it makes it a lot easier to deal with.

AA11173395	Go see a chiropractor.|`|2KY15bnWaa	Well you dont just suddenly get a pinched nerve. Something had to have triggered it - mine was from a car accident. I usually don't hurt for that long afterwards. You do not want a pinched nerve. It is permanent, and unfortunetly there is no way to fix it. So the good - you would know what is wrong. The bad - the pain is there to stay. You can't heal a pinched nerve, and it wont heal on its own. If the feeling is like pins and needles, and it comes when you move a certain way, you should get checked for a pinched nerve. What you are describing, wait a month or so and see if the pain continues and try to pinpoint what causes it and the area hurting. Most pinched nerve tests cost at least $1000 out of pocket - it sucks! So be sure. Maybe consult a doctor, do some research good luck and let me know if you need any more help.<br>  <br>  Just read other answers - a CAT scan, etc will not show a pinched nerve. I forget what the test is called, but they send shocks up your arm or whatever area, and on a machine it shows the shocks going through your nerve. If it suddenly slows or stops at one point you have a pinched nerve. I've gone to three different doctors and all said a pinched nerve is permanent. Good luck|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	I would suggest you seeing a chiropractor.  They are really smart and know your nerves and can give you exercises to strengthen certain muscles and can give you the best advice.
3BGJETHYaa	Fruit.  Noodles, rice, bread.   Meat.  You need noodles and the like for energy if you are serious about exercising.<br>  <br>  Simply lifting weights isn't going to leave you in good shape, especially if you've only been working on your arms.<br>  <br>  Do lots of crunches, situps, and ab workouts.  Exercise all of your muscles.<br>  <br>  Do cardio- run, bike, swim, or whatever.|`|a4IR6tYqaa	If you want six pack abs it depends on if the abs are not developed or there is a layer of fat between the abs and the skin that prevents the abs from being seem.  No such thing as spot reduction for fat, but you can build the large muscle groups and that will increase the metabolism for much longer than the running will.  Running is good for overall health and cardio fitness, but it's benefits to metabolism ends when you stop running.   Sit-ups and crunches will build the abs and obliques up so they will show; if the layer of fat is not obstructing the view.<br>  <br>  Some results of your Lenten diet will depend on what routines you are using for lifting now.  Be sure to follow good habits and behaviors in lifting weights.<br>  <br>  Replacement foods.......fresh grains, fruit and veggies.  Eat lots of protein and about 50% of your calories from carbs. Eat small amounts of fat but that will naturally be in some foods so don't worry about getting fats.....only avoiding the Trans Fat or Polys.  Don't eat carbs late in the day and eat several small meals during the day.  Drink LOTS of water starting the day with 12oz of cold water in the morning to jump start the metabolism.  <br>  <br>  Not an expert but if you have specific questions send me a message.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	cardio (running) is your best bet, keep up the sit-ups!<br>  <br>  avoid salty foods (soups) or carbs such as pasta - they tend to bloat you in the midsection<br>  <br>  there are great 100 cal packs if you do still have the urge
AA11388527	You could possibly have mono.  Not everyone who gets it shows symptoms or all the same symptoms.  I agree you should be tested.  But take heart, most people already carry Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) by the time they reach adulthood.  It's these two viruses that cause mono, EBV more often than CMV.  And if you already have EBV, you can't get it again.|`|MxqAwlqyaa	no mono is debilitating fatigue and swollen organs    You just have a virus
JeazxWDtaa	Thats bad.. your suposed to eat alot more than that. And a turkey sandwich is more than 200 calories unless its one piece of bread with two slices of turkey in it. You need to eat more because this will not help you lose weight. And its bad too count calories in gum... do you have an eating disorder?|`|AA11481224	yes|`|7swefA6Paa	way too much sugar and processed chemical laden foods.  eat more veggies and drink  lots of water to fill you up, and add some low cal fruit in there (strawberries are about 4 cal a piece).   also, you should never eat less than 1200 calories a day because it will trigger your body into going into starvation mode (your body will think you are starving and will store all your calories as fat in order to keep you alive longer) and the weight you will lose will be water weight and muscle. then whenever you eat more you will gain weight twice as fast due to your screwed up metabolism.|`|X7i1iGhgaa	You do not count the calories from gum.

g7uMKvEzaa	No, If you give up things you love, you will get frustrated and give up watching your diet. Everything is ok in moderation and that is true, (unless you are allergic to it.)I would make your coffee just as you love it and enjoy every sip of it. 30 calories is not much at all. You could burn that off in no time..Maybe give up calories on something else you aren't as fond of. GOOD LUCK!|`|FaVYRoXqaa	no, it's fine.  Just remember to count it towards your daily limit.|`|AOr92DhTaa	I would not worry about the 30 calories, if you just drink one or two cups of coffee in the morning.|`|H2txnM65aa	Count in with the rest of your daily intake and you'll be fine!
42cQpxviaa	there's no "too quick" time. honestly, it makes no difference, but using tampons scares some girls and they just chose not to. it's okay, whatever you chose. i was weird and tried to use one before i got my period, just out of curiosity, and couldn't figure it out. but then when i actually got my period it was so easy and natural. whenever you want will be fine.|`|dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	You can start using them now but make sure that you have the right protection for your flow. To large of tampons for a light flow can cause damage. Also make sure that you alternate tampons with pads to avoid TSS (TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME)  TSS is caused by bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus. When a tampon is left inside your vagina for too long, it creates a perfect environment for different types of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, to grow. To avoid developing TSS, follow these guidelines when using tampons:    Change your tampons at least every 4-8 hours or more often if necessary.   Choose the correct tampon absorbency. Use smaller sized tampons when your flow is lighter. TSS occurs more often when super-absorbent tampons are used. Don't use these unless your menstrual flow is particularly heavy.   Alternate between pad and tampon use. You might want to use pads at night, and tampons in the daytime.   Wash your hands before inserting or taking out your tampon.   Don't use tampons to absorb anything other than your menstrual flow. Only insert a tampon once menstrual blood is present.   If you experience the following symptoms while wearing a tampon, remove the tampon, and contact your health care provider immediately! These symptoms may seem similar to the flu. If they occur while you are menstruating and wearing a tampon, they may signal TSS. Otherwise, it might mean that you have another infection. It is recommended that you see your health care provider regardless. Symptoms of TSS include:    Sudden high fever   A sunburn-like rash   Diarrhea   Dizziness, fainting, or lightheadedness   Vomiting|`|rAQADfSvaa	You can use tampons any time you have your period, just make sure you buy the type suited for your flow and change it regularly.|`|7Xcl9XLoaa	whenever you feel like it|`|06HPTp3uaa	Well.  Use them when you think you're ready.   I think you should use pads for a while then go ahead with tampons.  But if you use tampons for the first time, and never had sex before or anything ; its possible that you will break your hymen.    But don't worry if you do break it. it shouldnt hurt alot just a small pain.|`|GQ6Yn5cIaa	I personally don't like them at all. I would try and if you really don't like them just don't use them. I sometimes use them when i am swimming though or i just won't go swimming during the summer|`|YkmVbpDeaa	You can start using them now.|`|0vg85K6Xaa	I think U could use them.|`|kKDbi5Zwaa	I got my period the first damn day of 6th grade, how ironic?  But I started wearing tampons the next night, pads are just not comfortable for me.|`|lZ7zfzLRaa	i used a tampon the first day i ever got my period. start now.|`|lPDRQH7aaa	I started using them when I joined the swim team. I found out they don't hurt and it doesn't smell bad down there. So I would use them now. You will feel fresh and clean while you are on your period!|`|3IV97IJbaa	i would waith till you are completely comfortable with your period before you start.  and i know it sounds stupis but practice putting one in first|`|f4doqdSCaa	Whenever you are comfortable with it. Some girls aren't ready when they first start, others just can't deal with pads and use tampons right away. I didn't, but I'd never go back to pads now, that's for sure!|`|3oJL2Go3aa	You should be able to use them now. However you need to watch out for the toxic shock syndrome. My mom gets it everytime she has worn tampons. I would start off with a regular one and see if you over flow if so then you can try going to the supers.. Just be careful and if it feels uncomfortable then take it out. I had that problem after having my daughter. I was tired of using pads and my 6 weeks were up so I tried to use a tampon and I couldnt. Now my daughter is 11 1/2 months and I just started using them again.. So all I can say is be careful and look up the toxic shock syndrome and the symptoms before using tampons. Good Luck!!|`|pUsdnm5Caa	tampons are a known case of cervical cancer. stay away from them|`|b2hH8tPAaa	i started about a month after i started. i HATE the feeling of being dirty and unclean "down there"     but you should start now, actually it doesnt really matter anyways.  they might hurt, they might not    it hurt the first few times, but it gets better
39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	The term "popped her cherry" refers to a guy having sex with a girl and it being the girl's first time, therefore he is "taking" her virginity. <br>  <br>  However, it has nothing to do with your hymen, as your hymen can be torn through many other various activities, unrelated to sex, such as tampon use, masturbation, horseback riding, vigorous exercise, etc. Many people think that the hymen is an indicator of virginity and is only torn the first time a girl has sex, but this is erroneous for the reasons stated above.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	popped your cherry means that he penetrated you and took your virginity.|`|jp3WrE1caa	broke your hymen|`|RIjjibnwaa	broke your hymen.|`|mr540I3iaa	Lost your virginity basically.|`|pexxZB8Daa	he broke ur hymen, lol.|`|WvnRraBQaa	He broke your hymen.~~~~~

In all honesty, you can just eat more of something else to get 200 calories than to have dessert..but if you want to have dessert then go ahead (sounds like you deserve it ) lol and that sounds very good (though i would not include whipped cream because it has no nutritonal value whatsoever)    good luck and i'm really glad you've chosen a healthier lifestyle for yourself!|`|eTxk4lSxaa	Yep since it looks like the banana represents at least half of your calories and fruit has a lot of additional benefits, fibre and vitamins apart from tasting sweet|`|o1pXRFtUaa	sounds really good :-)|`|XL9CUrp2aa	Sure and it's still healthy for you too!

HA2IV3r3aa	You can't make it heal any faster.  We Soldiers get blisters all the damned time, and we usually have to put our boots right back on the next day and go be active and hooah.  So there are a lot of home-remedies to make the pain more bearable.  Here's what I do:  Puncture the blisters near the base with a very small needle.  Gently squeeze out all of the discharge and be careful not to rip the skin anywhere other than where you already punctured it.  Dry the area off, throw some foot powder on there, and then bandage the blister with Moleskin.  It's some soft, thick bandages you can buy at any drugstore.  Then slap on some really thick socks that will minimize friction.  It will still hurt, but it will hurt a lot less than doing nothing.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Pop the blister and deal with the little bit of pain you might still have|`|BzQp8qUXaa	cut off your foot above the heel so your heal wont hurt.      Or you could wrap it in a bandage with some rubbing or cleansing alcohol and not irritate it by touching it and hope it dies down by then.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	pop the blisters, use antibiotics and put bandaides on them if you wait for them to go away on thier own they will just get worse while skiing if it is not better by then put on bandaides and where socks that are more padded to help with the pain|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	That is only 2 days away.  They won't heal that quickly.  You can try to cover them to pad them and protect them.    Here is a website with instructions on how to make it heal quickly, but it won't heal in 2 days, sorry.    Wash the area completely with soap and warm water.   Using a pin -- or needlenose tweezers -- sterilized in alcohol and/or by boiling water, pierce the outer edge of the blistered skin in 2-3 spots. Gently push down on the blister with a clean tissue or cotton to drain it.   Mix 1 cup of Epsom Salts with 1 gallon of warm water in a basin and soak the blistered area for 15-30 minutes. Dry the blister and pierce it again if it has refilled with fluid or salt water.   Many large blisters involve more than the top layer of skin and may need to be pierced deeper, and drained again. Using a cotton ball, apply alcohol to the blister for fifteen minutes, but never peel the skin off ! Soak the blister with warm water mixed with Epsom Salts 3 times a day for the first day or two, keep it bandaged loosely and try not to walk on it or use the blistered hand. By the second day there should be almost no swelling and the dead skin of the blister should start to dry and harden. Leave the skin alone. It will often reconnect to some degree or slough off in a couple of weeks...In the meantime, it protects the area from further damage.   If the skin of the blister has begun to tear off, be sure to keep the area clean, and trim away the loose skin using small sterilized scissors. Cut off only the skin that is already torn. Repeat this procedure - soaking with the Epsom Salts (any drugstore carries it). You may want to apply an antibacterial cream (such as Neosporin) for a day or two, keeping the area loosely bandaged to protect it.   If you're plagued with foot blisters from shoes or socks rubbing, there is a rub-on lotion (glide, slide, blister-free) to apply to your feet before exercise to keep your socks and shoes from rubbing against easily blistered places on your feet. It works great. Also try switching to thinner, seamless socks and newer, well fitted shoes.     Keep it clean.   Except for periods of soaking, keep the blistered area dry.    Warnings    Do not use a match to sterilize the instrument that you will use to pierce the blister --fire will oxidize any coatings on the metal and leave black, sooty particulate that can cause an infection.     If the blister oozes anything except clear fluid, see a doctor immediately. Very serious infections can start with a little blister.     Never pierce/pop a blood-filled blister. See a doctor.     Blisters from burns need the immediate attention of a doctor. These types of blisters are more prone to infection.     Don't scratch, peel, or rub your blister, as doing so can cause an infection.|`|IXN6lJgcaa	ok i dont think it will be 100% better by then but wrap the blisters (it may be painful while wrapping them) but use soft gause!! not tape or anything!|`|IZfi37oaaa	most people will probably agree with this suggestion.. but if i were u i would get a sterile needle (u can sterilize a needle by leaving it in a cup of hydor peroxide for a couple of minutes) or a blade and pop those blisters. The reason being the pain u r feeling is caused by the fluid that has built up underneath your skin,.. as soon as u pop the blister the fluid will be able to leave the area and most or all the pain u r feeling right now will be gone. be sure to pour hydro peroxide on them after u pop them and promptly place band aids on them. (very important u don't want anything to get under ur skin and infect the blister..)  if u choose not to pop them all i can suggest is band aids lots of band aids and wear two to three pairs of socks while u skiing so that u won't bother ur blisters anymore ...  good luck|`|NMwNKcXQaa	oh boy!  this happened to me too! it hurts so bad!!! but mine were real uggs and cause the backs are so solid in the designer ones my ankle stated to bleed allot!!! i didn't even notice till i took them off D: i just thought my ankle hurt   but anyway what i did is wrap an ace bandage around my ankle so shoes or UGG's wouldn't rub against it and irritate it more.  but every night(or as much as you can) prop your foot up or soke it in warm water.   and once a day take 1 advil so the it doesn't hurt to much   soon if will feel better i suggest wearing sandals as much as possible until then  and on the day of the trip take 3      but if you really want to be safe you should pop it and put pain Relief neosporian on it andProceed w/ the rest of my directions          GOOD LUCK HOPE YOU HAVE FUN!!!
f2824c0ffab42869900d5ccd3ca8501eaa	The trials the doctor gave you are your contact lens prescription. He gives you trials to try them out. He needs you to report back because he needs to make sure they fit on your eye appropriately and there are no problems. If you just put your contacts in, it might take a few days to adjust to your contact lens prescription. The contact lens prescription is different than your glasses. If you have a slight under   -0.75 astigmatism, he might not have corrected it. That could be a cause of blurriness. It's hard to say without seeing your prescription. If you are still seeing blurry after 4 days, I'd be sure and bring that up to the doctor when you see him for the follow up appointment.
7B1jccjVaa	wash your face really well tonight (don't scrub too hard). cover up or foundations (or whatever you use) is the only way to clear it up. you can go to your closest drugstore and get Clean and Clear Acne Spot Treatment (about $7), but it wont get rid of them, just make them a bit less noticeable. also, drink a lot of water between now and tomorrow morning. even though it wont be able to do much in such a short period of time, something is better than nothing, right?  good luck! i know how much this sucks, don't worry!|`|06HPTp3uaa	Alright, If your talking about getting pimples ; its possibly just that your getting stressed from it.

ufgv7oTjaa	Most all B complexes shouldn't have baker's yeast (the kind that can foster Candida growth) in it, but the B Vitamins commonly come from brewer's yeast (which doesn't make Candida grow in most people). Some people completely misunderstand this because they just see "yeast" and avoid it. There is an incredibly small percentage of the population that might have a bad reaction to brewer's yeast.  I can't think of any B complex I've ever seen that actually had yeast in it, but there might be some low quality ones that don't use pure brewer's yeast and use some baker's yeast... but that would be a stretch to me. I hope I helped!|`|PpKJIT0aaa	She's not entirely correct. There's about 100 types of yeast; some which promote Candida (make it worse) and some which fight it. Also, garlic can help; ditto a good quality Acidophilus - make sure it's not one which dissolves in the stomach, which most are, as that would defeat the purpose.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	read the label for sure brewers yeast which is a form of vitamin B  has yeast in it.    some things use sugar - some starch - just read the label for ingredients.

InDYqofBaa	First of all, 2 stone is nothing you can drop off that fast so it will take some time. I suggest you start with your eating habits as thats what's most important.<br>  Always eat breakfast! You might think skipping a meal may help, but not when it comes to breakfast. It's called breakfast because when you're sleeping you aren't eating, so when you do eat something in the morning you're breaking your fasting from over the night...!<br>  Breakfast yes, is the most important meal of the day as it kick starts your metabolism (the rate your body burns it's energy) so you're burning calories throughout the day at a steadied pace. It is always recommended you eat within 20-30 minutes after waking up as this is the best restart point for your metabolism.<br>  Did you know? Chewing gum helps increasing your metabolism by 20% (your body thinks you're eating but you're not!)<br>  Meal plan should start off big for breakfast, medium for midday and a small snack in the evening as you require most of your energy during the early and main part of the day rather than the end of the day...<br>  Record down your daily weight as this will keep you focused and more determined to loose the weight plus changing the foods you eat to more healthier options and reduced calories is essential and always exercise when you have the opportunity to do it. Whether its dancing in your room to some music or some mild stretching.<br>  It's worked for me!<br>  Diet duration should take up to 6-8 weeks. Noticeable results after one week.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Healthy loss of weight is 3lb per two weeks so 18weeks|`|Cqnbmd7Baa	Eat plenty of prunes, and have all bran 4 breakfast. I give it 3 days max.

KAnEq8Laaa	That stuff is a total scam, as are most "diet aids". I wouldn't waste my time or money on it. If it's a pill or a powder or a potion, is not going to do you any more good than cutting calories, eating a balanced diet, and getting exercise are going to, but it will cost you money. In the end, the people who benefit from diet pills are the manufacturers.    That being said, if you insist on taking diet pills, you tell your doctor. If there is something you're taking that you cannot tell your doctor about, then perhaps you should reevaluate what you're taking.|`|tVn7pfqKaa	I'm guessing slimquick is like slimfast, the dietary milkshake supplement?    If so it's available for any age, due to it's just a compound mix that gives you nutrients and basic needs in it's most basic form, which cuts out alot of fat and calories.
MhpccWpmaa	Plan B is basically a pill that contains really high doses of birth control hormones in it.  It's supposed to prevent unwanted pregnancies.  Basically if you have unprotected sex you have 72 hours afterwards in which you can take the Plan B pill and this prevents from a fertilized egg attaching to your uterus lining, therefore preventing pregnancy|`|n68tCJ7zaa	it's basically amped up birth control pills that make the egg not able to attach to the uterus so you can't become pregnant.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Plan B = the morning after pill, or emergency contraceptive. You can take it after unprotected sex to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in your uterus.|`|rGci1ehoaa	its for people who either didnt use a condom or the condom broke and they arent using birth control... it is to keep you from becoming pregnant... you can take it up to 72 hours after unprotected sex|`|F9Uz05FXaa	The plan B pill is used within 48 hours of having unprotected sex, to insure that you do not get pregnant
8odbNnkwaa	You can tell the difference between Bipolar disorder and Schizophrenia because people tend to have unpredictable mood swings and is more common when it has past family experiences. Also Anxiety disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder can occur from Bipolar disorder, while Schizophrenia starts with genetics and then is provoked with childhood vulnerability and Drug abuse can also lead to Schizophrenia.|`|xnZi0i8saa	They are not the same. I am Bipolar 1 and I do not have any of the symptoms of schizophrenia. <br>  <br>  Psychosis is sometimes a symptom of bipolar as it is also a "symptom" of schizphrenia, it is not the only symptom of schizophrenia. That's like saying that Asthma and a cold are the same because they both have a cough.......<br>  <br>  Ok, how can we clear this up......... Phychosis is where a person loses touch with reality... this may include hallucinations and delusions. Schizophrenia is a severe break from reality, the psychosis is a MAJOR sysmtom and there are no mood swings. Bipolar individuals have SEVERE mood swings and phychosis is rare. There is a disorder that is a cross between bipolar and schizophrenia, it's called schizoaffective disorder. Do some research, or don't. I'm not sure why you asked when you think you already know better than the whole psychiatric community.... I mean Jeez why the hell do they need two different names when they are obviously the same thing............ Get your facts straight.|`|HCn3ztAvaa	Bipolar is a completely different illness. Bipolar is when someone experiences wild mood swings for almost no reason at all. They could be happy and joking around one moment, and screaming and yelling at you the next. Schizophrenia is where you hear voices and see hallucinations that seem really real.|`|NIVwFu1Baa	Bipolar is when you have extreme moods from happy to sad in a second, while chizophrenia is when your afraid of stuff and like beind paranoid|`|dE8RxZMwaa	bipolar people are  like moody like girls on their period or girls that are pregnant...... and the second one has voices in their heads telling them to do stuff like sometimes kill people kinda scary i know|`|TdqeC0vmaa	ok to clarify some misinformation in the last answer....<br>  <br>  Typically bipolar individuals do not have sudden mood shifts. Their mood states last for weeks to months even years at a time. <br>  <br>  And to clarify in your question<br>  <br>  People with bipolar disorder do not often have psychotic episodes. <br>  depending on the type of bipolar some may not even ever reach full blown mania let alone become psychotic. <br>  <br>  Some individuals with bipolar do become psychotic when they are severely depressed or severely manic but not everyone with bipolar has this.<br>  <br>  A very clear distinction as far as psychosis can be made between schizophrenia and bipolar with this. Bipolar individuals who have psychotic symptoms have them during episodes of extreme depression or extreme mania. <br>  <br>  Schizophrenic individual can have psychotic symptoms regardless of and separate from their mood. <br>  <br>  In order to diagnos schizophrenia it is a diagnostic guideline to rule out a mood disorder of bipolar 1 with psychotic features or a combination like schizoeffective by the individual having psychotic symptoms for a long duration in the absence of mood disorder symptoms.

Pay attention to your body and not your 'body image' .<br>        What we call "food" today is less food and more of a processed drug ,and pretty much empty of nutrients until companies "enrich" them. <br>       Avoid white flour, white rice, white sugars ,etc. Eat as much live food as you want .

It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and establish whether you are really overweight for your size or not, by calculating your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the only method that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost twenty pounds, it definitely does work!

t9Nw86Plaa	Going on the limited amount of information given in your question, I would say that:   - the leg pain is because you are out of shape; it doesn't sound like juvenille arthiritis   - not eating breakfast and is a major problem; I'm guessing you only eat one (large, since it's your only meal) dinner, and maybe some unhealthy snacks. EAT BREAKFAST (oatmeal, fruit, cereal, whatever!) and this alone will help you lose weight and have more energy for P.E.   - to get into shape, exercise (start slow, ie. walk around the block, bike riding, swimming, and gradually get more and more active) and eat multiple small but healthy meals throughout the day (NOT just one meal)    good luck!|`|T12qECtnaa	your probably just out of shape. Start slow and run/walk for about 30 minutes a day. Work on this until you can run the whole 30 minutes and then increase distance and time. It takes time to get into shape, just don't give up.
UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|KvyB0E77aa	My wife got it last week and I haven't  slept in days.  HELP!

I agree that a TSH test is of little value though.|`|FAc6ozKPaa	Actually the TSH is of little value since everyone's "normal" is different. You need your doctor to test your Free T3 and Free T4. Also, get tested for Hashimoto's disease. If you are positive for hashi's then your TSH won't matter b/c it will vary quite often (hashi's people have both hyper and hypo thyroid symptoms).  Personally, I am still hypo and my TSH is at .31 (but i have hashi's). Basically, If your Free T3 isn't at the top of your lab range, you need a thyroid med- I recommend armour!
POFdWpUzaa	The progression of diabetes is reliant on many factors, such as: age of the person diagnosed; health of the person diagnosed; family history of the person diagnosed; does the person rely on diet and exercise  or meds and/or insulin to control the diabetes; does the person take care of him/herself and is the diabetes under control. All of these factors will alter the progression of the disease. This is a very, very difficult theme you've chosen. Why not choose one aspect of the disease, ie, controlling diabetes with diet and research glycemic index and make a diet plan for a person with diabetes. That would be a large enough task to tackle. Good luck!|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Well it depends. Some people are born with Type I diabetes. Some people develop Type II diabetes over time. I am Type II and it was over the course of a year and the only way I knew that was looking at medical records. The exact moment it happens is unknown. It depends on the person and the cause. I do not think there is any standard time frame. However, for Type II there is what they call pre-diabetes and you can find more on the internet if you Google that phrase. You can find charts with the blood glucose ranges.|`|pU34m5Syaa	My child was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 18mths.

He was rushed to the hospital were they said had he not got there when he did he most likely would have died.

qKpRCwVXaa	The maximum amount of Dextromethorphan for adults is 1 gram (1000 mg) per dose and 4 grams (4000 mg) per day. Taking more Dextromethorphan could potentially damage your liver so yes, 75 MG of Dextromethorphan is safe to take within a 24 hour period. However, as per the 500 MG acetaminophen you should be careful as depending upon your metabolic tolerance and pharmacological predisposition it could cause a potential conflict(if taken excessively), but the 6.5 MG of doxylamine succinate should not comorbidly cause any other health problems. You should also be cognizant of the fact that these drugs taken over a period not constituting 2 weeks or more can cause/increase risk of health complications.
46b917a157d5aaff534db257443de9f5aa	A special mesh material is used for the repair and, depending on the local hospital arrangements and your own fitness, it may be done under local or general anaesthetic and sometimes by keyhole surgery.     Most operations are done in under an hour and you can go home the same day.     I found this on a site so according that you should ask the hospital that you will be getting treated at and dicuss with them what options you have and how they usually perform the operation. If they do not do local at that is the only way you would like to have the treatment you could possibly try other hospitals near you and see if they do it under local anesthetic.     Hope this helped!
Yx5iSat4aa	No.|`|HA2IV3r3aa	No, it just means you are clean.  Your boyfriend might be clean, but STD transmission isn't guaranteed.  You can have unprotected sex with someone with various STDs and not catch anything, just like you can be in a room filled with people who have the cold and not catch it.  But you should still always have protected sex.  Just because STD transmission isn't guaranteed 100% of the time you still have a damned good chance of catching one if you are having sex with an infected person.

YMKNOUZTaa	First, malaria and sickle cell have nothing to do with AIDS, sorry 2nd poster.  Homozygous means you have sickle cell.  This changes the chemical composition of your red blood cells and inhibits them from carrying oxygen.  The cells are a "sickle" shape, which changes what can go in and out of the cell, including malaria.  So, malaria can't infect the sickle cells.  It is believed that sickle cell developed solely as a protection from malaria.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	homozygous is actually more protected because malaria cannot take over the sickle shaped blood cells.|`|6zCalKvKaa	Not necessarily, but in any case if you are at risk of getting malaria and sickle cell you already have AIDS so they are the least of your problems.

You are young, and life at this point is difficult and hard to explain. Many people your age have never had a boyfriend/girlfriend, and if they are insecure about that fact, they lower their standards and be with someone. My best friend was 18 when he got his first girlfriend; he didn't change who he was and they have been together for 1.5 years. I believe that you should never lower your standards, or change who you are or whatever it is, just to be with someone. Chances are, no one wants to be with someone who isn't comfortable with themselves.   I am really shy when talking to those of the opposite sex, but when I realized that it was in my power to change my happiness without changing who I am, I sucked it up. If it means living and possibly loving some time down the road, don't you think that is something worth living for? Just because its difficult to find someone now, doesn't mean it won't be down the road. Just have patience and courage. Go talk to someone. You probably won't get a girl on the first try, but if you keep at it for a while, someone will relize that you are the missing piece to their life.|`|FvmLoso6aa	If you're seriously thinking about suicide you should seek out help.

It sounds like you have a problem with your self-esteem and may possibly have an anxiety or other disorder.  My first reaction would be to see your doctor and get referred to a specialist that understands mental health.    Less than four years ago I was in your shoes, wishing to get out of life.  While things are never perfect, I can say I am totally glad to not have given into those thoughts.  I had problems with girls due to shyness, too.

chOS6EO0aa	If the leaking is white that is normal and if it is red (light or dark) you may be seeing your period. You are going through puberty and so your body is beginning to change and mature. We all felt little weird about that time. Just be yourself, I know we think the whole world is staring at us, but they aren't. Meat has nothing to do with your growth. You may want to buy a bra and carry around sanitary products.

That can cause a sore throat.  Are your tonsils swollen? You could have tonsilitis.  If it persists for a couple more days, you really should see a doctor.  Don't be afraid of a strep test, they just swab your throat.  It's quick and painless.

Make sure you don't have Mono or that you're not enemic.  2) Drink stuff with sugar and caffeine (like Starbucks) - just don't take any pills.  3) If nothing is wrong with you - then exercise some more - that is a common side-effect of not getting enough!  Hope you feel better!
wQEdey24aa	Hmm, Im surprised she didnt just ignore it as she must be knowing that it would be really embarassing for you. But yeahh, sorry, she definitely does know what it was.she wasnt born yesterday :-)  say you should let it go and dont bring it up again cause itll just be awkward and embarassing for you and her. Also dont worry about it cause Im its no surprise for ur mumur a 16yr old guy and what u were doing is very normal. Just be careful next time and CLEAN UP!!! :-)|`|YrHuv1g3aa	she obv knows your 16 every guy from 12 - forever masturbates its normal everyones you do it sometime|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Yes, your mum knows exactly what it was. She knew before she asked. Also, your mum knows that you masturbate and she is not be at all surprised that you do. And she does your washing and cleans your room and the bathroom, so she knows what you do in there too. She is probably wondering whether to discuss it with you or just ignore the situation.|`|ZOmv6sUVaa	dont feel embarrased....i do it all the time..WELL i dont get caught?! I am pretty sure she knows...but she wants you to be honest!.......my mom says that most all moms want there kids to be open about ANYTHING!!|`|0JERmAslaa	probably. oh well dude|`|lCvJHS13aa	Of coarse she knew what is was, she is probably more pissed that you were using the computer to whack your wienie or that your didn't clean it up.  And why would you be in an area doing that where it was so easy anyone could just walk in on you?    If your 16, you've probably been doing this for a while, she knows.|`|2gdWeMRfaa	im sure she knows, but why let it get to you, its pretty normal behavior. you can try telling her the truth and say that you had an urge and you couldnt help it, if she's open to you masturbating, tell her that you'll do it in private from now on and that most guys ur age do it|`|8mfFWUZpaa	dude i reckon she knows what it was and she just wanted u to be honest with her so yer i'd just tell her im sure she wont be mad|`|yXDtGo8taa	Happened to me once too     My excuses used to be "pop-ups" or "A virus"    Don't bother telling her the truth, ignorance is bliss|`|TweZlF73aa	LMFAO dude that sucks i'm sorry! i masturbate at the computer sometimes but i don't get to finish off at the computer always want's it but i think all moms know you do that at the computer or at the tv. DOn't tell her if she didn't yell at you about it then i think you should be fine. My mom knows i do and she picks on me about it but i don't care IT FEELS GOOD

I know you brain shrinks after 25! (scary) And I think sometimes ppl's spine, and feet grow a little too. It really depends on the person.

AA10299265	According to this article, it was released in Japan last November:  http://kotaku.com/5057870/nintendo-annou...
01Mu3wUeaa	1: There is no such thing as the stomach flu.Its called Norwalk virus.  2: No, doesn't sound like it.Usually, the symptoms are sudden and believe me, when you get it, you will know (uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting)    It could be a number of things from fatigue to low blood sugar.      Noro prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|D9NgLfTQaa	I have the same problem right now...... Have you puked??
uIzmBj9gaa	No, that's right where you should be. Exercise (especially strength training, and no, you won't get bulky) and healthy eating can speed up your metabolism.|`|nMHxO5gBaa	For your height and age, your ideal weight is between 90 and 112lbs.  You're well within range.    To increase your metabolism, you may want to build more muscle mass.  http://thehappyhealth.com/updates/?p=139    The muscle cells are about 8 times more metabolically demanding than fat cells. This means that larger the percentage of muscle you have in your body, the faster your metabolic rate becomes. This may explain why some people cant gain weight fast.    Even if youre resting, you body burns 8 times more calories than normal. Therefore having more muscle mass can helps you to burn more fat and calories.    Weight training enhances muscle mass and density, and it strengthens bone mass.
DPegPYRPaa	Try Miderma|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	hydrocortisone may help with the itch, but scars are for life.|`|90cyv9f0aa	Yes, it is safe to use hydrocortisone cream on scars.   Apply it to the scarred spot everyday for a week.   Stay out of the sun, as the sun can increase discolouration.    BUT...  ONE OF THE best home remedies for scars is actually lemon juice, since it is a natural bleach and will lighten scars!|`|X40Ww89qaa	no scars aren't inflammed|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Neosporin I think thats how you spell it, buy that.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	use that with some vitamin e lotion or oil|`|AlV10Equaa	i wouldn't maybe you should just leave it be that's what i would do|`|NBK3s2LVaa	Try Maderma that stuff works miracles|`|A73ForyRaa	it might but coco butter and vitamin E oil works better and faster|`|mPS2Zccaaa	Try Miderma, but Hydrocortisone will not help. That's an anti-inflammatory cream.|`|AA11556445	Aveeno oatmeal, calamine, or benadryl lotion is better to control the itching.  Cocoa butter fades scars.
blVOODknaa	I am so sorry that you're not feeling well. But the best thing you can do at this point is wait to hear the diagnostic of a doctor. They should be able to tell you what's wrong and what kind of treatment you would need. Hope to get better, God bless!|`|hJm3mGflaa	lupus and glandular fever  hmm, have you had any symptoms involving your skin, such as rashes, flu?  But besides that the most important thing is to get alot of rest, lay down and relax yourself, it is not fatal and is supposed end within 3-4 weeks, however you have said that these symptoms have come and gone, so you must let the doctor handle this, importantly don't worry and trust me, get alot of rest.

Don't wait until you need to go to the hospital from an act, if you are honestly afraid for your own safety right now from the suicidal thoughts and such you can check yourself in for observation.

vsAUAhqUaa	she's trippin' out maaaannnn|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	She probably burned her throat from taking a huge hit.  It is probably going to go away.  At the very worst it is a first degree burn.  Weed can also dry out your respiratory system (which can be good ... i used to smoke weed to alleviate my asthma ... it worked ... believe it).  So, her dry throat is probably making her burn even worse.      I haven't heard of anyone who got unbearable throat pain from smoking weed though.  But still, it is probably just her throat being burned.  It isn't permanent.  She will be fine after the burn heals, which should be sometime soon .... like a week or sooner.    It is weird that her throat is still hurting just from being burned ... I've never heard of that happening.  If it lasts for more than a day, which it probably won't, then have her go see a doctor.    Also, marijuana can make you freak/trip out.  She could just be freaking out about her throat hurting.|`|s88xJ20Saa	nothings wrong it happens to everyone just tell her too calm down
qBYZwuijaa	It sounds like you are a young man with low self esteem. Many of the reason you gave for feeling bad are signs of depression and you may have reason to be depressed.    However, you could be chemically depressed in which nothing will help but to get the right balance of medicine. It may take the doctors a while of trying different combinations to get it right but when they do you will feel so much better.     Please hang in there and get better. It will be worth it.  Of all the things you think you need, you really need God. He is the Almighty and can give you everything and anything you need. Just put your faith in God May God Bless you and heal you of your insecurities and unhappiness    I am a white female and have felt just like your described you are feeling. But with the right help you can get better. Depression cannot usually be cured but you can certainly learn how to live with it and lead a happy and prosperous life.
MhpccWpmaa	It's very possible that you have Bacterial Vaginitis.  This infection is actually more common than a yeast infection in women.  It is not caused by sex so you could very well have it.  One of the main symptoms is a really strong fishy odor that you can usually smell from like you said 6 inches or even more away from your vagina.  This smell usually gets worse around your period (although you don't have that yet).  Another symptom is the excessive discharge, although it's typically watery every female is different in the ways symptoms present themselves.  You need to go to the doctor ASAP and get this treated.  Especially since you've let it go for so long.  I understand it's embarrassing and it took me about a month to go to the doctors the first time I ever got it.  But it's nothing to be embarrassed about.  They will take swabs and send them out for testing to be positive that BV is what you have and in the meantime will prescribe you Flagyl which is a pill you take twice a day for a week that clears it right up.  The smell usually disappears after the pill is in your system for a couple days but keep taking the meds until they're gone or else it won't be fully cured and will come back.  If left untreated for a long period of time BV can cause pelvic inflammatory disease so it's important to get it treated.  And plus, I know what having one is like, it makes you very self-conscious about yourself.  Please go to the doctor and get this taken care of.  Best of luck sweetie :)
fKxrU5uGaa	i would assume by shower head you mean the water, and my best thought would be "its" irritated, your place is very sensitive and needs a break every so often, and the stomach pain could be cause by something other then your master-bating maybe you period is due or you ate something badd.|`|chOS6EO0aa	I dont even know if I understand what you are doing.But if you are pushing the shower head inside of you,check it to see if it is dirty,or it may be too big for you.Don't hurt yourself.|`|x6lxab67aa	Hmmm... I would hope you mean just the water.... but if the shower head is dirty, that might have something to do with it. Good luck! Sorry hun =(|`|hOjH3Iipaa	You're probably about to get your period. Masturbation right before your period can hurt like hell, so that's probably what's wrong. Might I suggest you try other methods of masturbation as well? If you don't like using you hands then maybe you should try one of those personal massage things you can buy from the shops. They're battery operated and they work really well. Sometimes you may experience what they call "hot spots" just before or just after your period when you get really horny, that's natural.
OUbNSXjJaa	Forget about your bodily illness. I  think you are mentally strong. That is what is required. Cheer up. Build courage. Body may be dull. But you should keep your mind not only strong, but pure and perfect. It will make your physical body strong. Not only that above all your future is safe.    Wish you all success. You have to venture. Wish you good luck and God speed.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	If you are really Ill there is nothing wrong with taking a semester off.  had a friend that had to from mono.  But just be aware that the more time you take off the harder it will be to get back into it.  But taking a semester off to get healthy so you can do your best should be fine.      Maybe considering taking one or two courses as a community college, or even ones you can take online just so you dont get completely out of the habit of studying.
IU273iyOaa	if u never had sex then ur not prego. its normal to have discharge but if ur discharge is not clear or white then u might have somethin and if it has a bad odor i think u need to go to the doc
Yn6pM2Xyaa	if the filling was a white/composite filling it would be almost completely cured by the time that he turns of the little light that he puts on it after filling before final filing.  Thus an hour or two later it would be fully cured.  If its a silver/amalgam filling then it takes longer to fully cure.  I would wait overnight before placing in the retainer in that case.  Either way you definitely do not want to put it in until the freezing comes out completely in case you do damage to your gums while putting it in.  No harm will come to not wearing it for a night so better play it safe and wait.  Geez, most people aren't nearly so happy to put one in their mouths!!  Good for you!
5LJUiqOUaa	your top jaw is supposed to go over your lower jaw . it just depends how deep it goes down . some people have a really deep overbite that you can't even see the lower teeth . but if it doesn't look that bad, you probably don't need braces . just ask your dentist the next time you go or see an orthodontist .|`|aEVUEWbqaa	Actually that's normal. It's the way we were created. In fact it's so normal that orthodontist use the 1st molars when the mouth is closed as landmark of normal teeth. Try this to to your bathroom, close your teeth together, pull your cheek back enough to see your 1st molars (your big chewing teeth toward the middle back.) If the front of your top molar is "sitting" on the middle of your lower 1st molar then you are in what we call Class 1 jaw position. Oh and to answer your last question, anyone can "use" braces.|`|VBQokfaxaa	its suppose to be that way.  unless it goes way to far over. talk to your dentist about seeeing an orthodontist.

Your lungs need time to heal. It will get better with time, say 4 -5 months.  In the meantime any OTC med like Mucinex to keep it loose will help. And keep yourself hydrated. Like 6-7 glasses of water a day. I don't know how long you smoked but be patient, it will get better.
WkD9oAUiaa	no it doesn't hurt. it kinda hurt this time because you are starting to use something different. in time you won't even notice them. and it wont hurt at all!!! oh and another thing, make sure you know about the TSS! Toxic Shock Syndrom. Google it and make sure you know everything. It just happends when you have a tampon in too long and not on your period. good luck!|`|T12qECtnaa	yeah it hurt me the first time cuz i was so light. When you full up the tampon it doesn't hurt and it doesn't hurt as you get used to them.|`|FNeCDm3raa	If it hurts, either you are dry, and aren't using the right absorbency for that time, or you need to find tampons that fit your body better.    I was using tampax pear - regular, and it did hurt me when coming out, and I kind of did feel it, even when the tampon was all the way in.    I switched to Tampax Slender Regulars, and they fit my body so much better. It doesn't hurt now when it comes out, and I feel nothing when they are in, whereas I did before. I guess my vagina is smaller than the average woman in America LOL|`|MK547eboaa	relax, and make sure that it has absorbed all that is can, because if it hurts coming out it could be because it is still too dry|`|LBxQJhllaa	It'd be kinda painful-ish if you pull out a tampon that is not....'full.' This is part of the reason you shouldn't use tampons when not on your period.    It shouldn't hurt, but it may be a bit uncomfortable.  Pull at the right angle, and you should be fine.  If it hurts with it just being in, it could either be something along the lines of cramps, or you may have not inserted the tampon far enough up and it is trying to 'crawl out.'|`|eKaGmMzTaa	It won't hurt. Sometimes you may feel uncomfortable (not pain just a lil uncomfortable but its very little) and the reason for that is because the tampon wasn't soaked with blood. This means it's too early to remove it, or it's the end of your period.|`|ZMjZF6CYaa	nope. maybe it not wet enough[no homo]  it has to be full of blood..  try i smaller absorbency|`|l1TJpNeqaa	make sure to wait.. The tampon will cause a little pain if you pull it out dry. Make sure to wait from the beginning of the day  until the end so that it is fully saturated.|`|e71KCQDWaa	you just need to relax.  it might hurt a little pulling it out.  if it doesn't come out you should see a doctor or parent..   _hope this helps_
f2824c0ffab42869900d5ccd3ca8501eaa	The cornea copes very well with minor injuries or abrasions. If the highly sensitive cornea is scratched, healthy cells slide over quickly and patch the injury before infection occurs and vision is affected. If the scratch penetrates the cornea more deeply, however, the healing process will take longer, at times resulting in greater pain, blurred vision, tearing, redness, and extreme sensitivity to light. These symptoms require professional treatment. Deeper scratches can also cause corneal scarring, resulting in a haze on the cornea that can greatly impair vision. In this case, a corneal transplant may be needed.    Your cornea should be as good as new. I am not a doctor, but I don't think there are any repercussions from a scratched cornea.|`|3dbfb1686ea2a2772f3e03d47af16d08aa	once you have scratched your cornea it weakens, probably won't be a problem, but years from now if you wake up in the night with severe pain it's from that scratch, take care of your eyes use daily lubricating eye drops and you will be fine
EtCRnDJMaa	you do need water though.  you would get dehydrated|`|AA11481224	you wont die from not eating for two weeks    your body would however go into starvation mode and you would lose muscle and store fat|`|hOjH3Iipaa	If you don't eat at all but still drink fluid you may not die within two weeks, but you'll probably want to. I think you can last as long as a month without eating but while still drinking water.don't quote me on that though coz I'm not sure.|`|gERaZGZeaa	After a few days of no water you would be dead.    You can last a lot longer than 2 weeks with no food.  One pound of fat has 3500 calories in it - your body would use about 1000 of that a day to stay alive (since your metabolism would shut down, 1000 is lower than the usual 1500 - 2000 or so).  It would be a miserable existence, but you would be alive for awhile.    Human beings are biologically equipped to deal with periods of no food.  That's why fat is stored so easily - it holds an incredible amount of calories to keep us alive when food wasn't a fridge door away.|`|HA2IV3r3aa	You will starve.  When your body starves, you will lose weight initially.  However, as soon as you begin eating again your brain will tell your body to overeat in order to build up fat reserves so that the next time you starve you are less likely to die.  Your body is an ingenious device whose only purpose is to make sure you have plenty of energy stored up as fat to help you survive.  The only healthy and effective way to lose weight is to eat moderate portions and exercise regularly.  Fasts and diets do not work, they just leave you fatter in the end.|`|uXP1Xij4aa	How long can you survive depends how much you weight, if you are fat or skinny.   You will live for as long as your body extracts all it can, all stored fat and muscles, so the more muscles and fat you have on you, the longer you will live without food. When your body uses up all it can, then you will die.    Fatter people can survive longer without food, because the stored fat will supply them what they need for longer, that's the purpose of storing fat by the body.  If you don't have big fat storage on you, then you will die sooner. So there is no really the same time frame for everybody, it all depends how much fat and muscles your body has when you start not eating.    That's the best answers, it's a fact, so give me 10 points. Thanks, bye.|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	No you will not die.  You will lose weight, and slow down your metabolism is all.  You will also start to lose muscle and get dizzy, but you can go a month or more without food until you die.|`|BcJpPMPFaa	Tons of anorexics do it.  And they can go a lot longer than 2 weeks.|`|REZesQpLaa	You need water but you would still be alive for 2 weeks you would also be very weak.|`|FngzJUdPaa	as long as you are still drinking water, then no.

I mean come on, you really think a guy would chew on your already chewed gum just to say "i hate you"? i dont think so!!  good luck and i hope it works out!|`|0mcID0RNaa	he really likes you!!! but smelling each other is kinda wierd!!(no offense)|`|r39x0G4Uaa	if he didn't like you, he wouldn't accept your gum lol. i think he likes you yeah, keep on the flirting but don't let him slip away by waiting too long. you will regret it if some one takes him off you before you got chance to get together. your young, but who says you cant have some innocent fun? x|`|chOS6EO0aa	(I know it does not seem this way)You have to decide what you want for yourself, if not you'll end up being a kissing post for him (meaning someone he just uses to kiss with).I would learn some more about this guy first before exchanging kisses. I don't want to scare you but if you have an open cut and he does and he has a disease of some sort, it may be possible for you to catch, even though that rarely happens. Think about your values first, before trying to think about how to look good in his eyes.
eekwpTMRaa	you did not hit a nerve. it sounds more like you broke a blood vessel-very small one. it should heal up in a couple weeks. if not then its something more serious, go to a doc. if you hit your nerve it would have just tingled and gone away|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	Shout OW!
lZ9Dl5Nhaa	Umm, 130's not that bad.  I weigh 160, and because I'm so tall I'm considered skinny (I'm five foot 9).  Anyways, keep doing the sit-ups...  What I do is I get on my bed and let my back hang off when I do sit ups.  That way you can lean back a little bit, which will help tone your lower abs.  To get rid of love handles, I turn on my side and slightly bend my knees, lift my leg up (keeping knee bent) and as I lift it up I slightly tilt my head towards my knee.  It REALLY helps.  I haven't been doing them for a long time, so my love handles came back, but it totally got rid of mine when I was doing them.|`|IjMHcECzaa	You can have muscles underneath fat, but doing sit ups wont remove them... they only help build up the muscle underneath.    This is a good thing though! Because now you should start RUNNING... that will make the muscles you have BURN the fat.   If you don't have muscles from sit ups, your fat will burn slower.     Either way you need to run.|`|r39x0G4Uaa	lay on your back.. put you legs on the sofa and lift them up 50 times.. it tightens the lower tummy. other would be lay on your back and scissor your legs about an inch from the floor. another is, do sits ups to each of your sides instead of just straight upward. to make sure your doing it right, feel your tummy below the belly button and it should be hard. good luck :) x  and i love the name brooke! sorry lol
UfkOQsE2aa	That's about right for your age.    Mine at 14/15 was only 3-3.5 inches.|`|8pTML1F9aa	not alot because u grow alot|`|PUDJMfwtaa	hereditary.|`|9ZxQ685Iaa	well the average for 13-14 is a little under 4, so its near average.|`|M83LclV4aa	Well i'm 9.4 inches|`|le6hDyURaa	i am 13 almost 14 and mine is 5.5 inches, but I think mines small also.      any more questions email me.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	that is normal|`|0JERmAslaa	ur fine dude ull grow|`|8mfFWUZpaa	fark it annoys when lil kids ask this farkin question ur di*ck is fine get over it|`|PAY58zPNaa	yup urs is average. your penis will still grow, dont worry your still going through puberty.|`|yXDtGo8taa	For your age it is normal, yes. By the time you have fully matured it should be around 6 inches.
f8mLpPXlaa	Sounds like colitis. Call your doctor and he/she will prescribe something to help you.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	It may be from an infection in your intestines (poop tubes). It could also be from too much of a digestive juice called bile that is produced in the liver.  I am glad your going to the dr on Friday, and be prepared, he/she will likely ask for a sample for testing. I am also glad you told your parents so they can get you to a dr.  Best wishes
Ba0AduWcaa	You should stop taking all those drugs and get with a guy like me..  I'll keep you up all night and stroke your ego...   I love ADD woman!  LOL|`|qBYZwuijaa	I prefer Adderall because I take it and it helps. It also is good to help suppress your appetite so you are not so hungry all the time and it gives you a little energy.    I think the side affects of Ritalin are worse than those of Adderall. Allerall is used for other types and depress and anxiety too. Ritalin is basically for ADD. But many are switching to Adderall. Give it a try and see if it makes you feel better.     I have also taken phentermine when I was not taking adderall. They are safer. I know that phentermine is to help you lose weight but it does not do that for me. It just gives me extra energy for my Chronic Fatigue.
a2DW1Bqgaa	YES! Your anus doesnt "spot" like your vagina, especially since your prego, see your doc. Even if he says no biggie, probably hemorrhoids, at least he can check you out.
XhIYAH6Laa	probably not, you may have one infected and one not. You should make an appt with your doctor to get it checked...if it is infected they can put you on antibiotics...good luck
8uiH6iRbaa	hey there !    im sure its nothing to worry about as you are a teenager it will take time for your periods to settle in as they should.   so don't go warring about tumours and pregnancy's.   this could be due to   * stress  *sudden weight loss/ sudden weight gain  *increased levels in exercise     or it could be that you just had a trial run for a while before it really gets started lol     if you are worried go and see your GP who will be able to pin point the problem xxxx|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Assuming that you are not sexually active, and it has to be said that statistically the commonest cause of a sexually active woman of child bearing age missing a period remains pregnancy, and you are otherwise fit, the odds are that this is not due to any significant pathology. However, if your periods are well established and have been regular for at least 2 years, I would still get your GP to give you a check up.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Periods can be very irregular when you are a teenager. They will generally settle down as you get older and your cycle becomes more established. There is nothing to worry about.|`|IyCnihLmaa	You need to see a dr. to tell you for sure - it could possibly be serious.    First of all is to rule out pregnancy.  You said you are not pregnant so I will assume that is true.  If you are exercising heavily or dieting that could lead to missed periods.  It could also be a tumor or something more serious so you do need to see a dr. to rule out more serious conditions.|`|r39x0G4Uaa	you need a doctor because it can be serious if your womb walls get thicker but does not shed.   the pill can regulate periods also x|`|5Kt8qlytaa	If you recently started a new birth control this can be somewhat normal.  You should still ask you gyno what she/he thinks.  The more you stress out about it, the longer it will take for it to come.  Also, there could be a medical reason such as ovarian syst or some problem with your uterus.  It would be best to call your doctor to see what they thnk.|`|udBgmZCjaa	Have u lost a weight because if u lose a lot of weight your periods can stop.  hope this helps   x x
XL9CUrp2aa	I know this sounds funny    George Carlin calls it a ***** Fart    It's normal, his penis pushes the air in and its just coming out down there that makes the sound.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	its called a fanny fart. air has got into your vagina and what goes in must come out|`|nmAjAH73aa	It is just the air escaping|`|TePrnC5iaa	usually the butt|`|PWDJLTyEaa	It's called a "queef" (or a vaginal "fart). But yes, its just because there is air bubbles trapped inside of you from going at it hard. I know its embarrassing.|`|fp3KY1MJaa	its just air and its normal. dont worry about it,|`|9HqgrhyUaa	you queefed. any girl should know that. its completly normal.|`|BPN8zY2yaa	my brother says it's a queef|`|ns9UfEI1aa	Queef.  lmao    Vagina Fart !|`|ZJ6bLAOiaa	maybe that is how your telling u how enjoy it is when and after u have a sex.|`|mfHq20pqaa	You have to be kidding.  Of course its freakin air.  Thanks for the laugh.|`|jDGF4cjlaa	he's pumping you full of air lol...its   a queef... never happened to me, but ive heard of it.|`|XVDZAiiVaa	its called a queef , it is a vagina part fro air getting in , it pushes it out.|`|40e721c1bfd11b9a991085e4902841e7aa	Sometimes during vaginal sex  or when a woman inserts something in her vagina  air gets pushed into the vagina. When the penis (or another object) is removed, the air is released, and it makes a noise. Sometimes air is also released even if nothing is inserted into the vagina. "Queef" is a slang term that refers to this noise. This is totally normal and it's nothing to worry about.|`|L7pavNcaaa	Its a queef. :p  need to know more?|`|1Sl45kHMaa	It all depends the position that you are in. Those are called ***** farts. The reason that happens air is going in there somehow. He takes it out a lot and let puts it back it or it came be while he is putting it he is taking it out to much. It needs to go in baby, that happens a lot in the doggy style position. Yes I know when It makes the sounds it feels embarrassed.|`|TemZzSuCaa	I've had the same problem. I still wonder what it is but I think its because of the "wet stuff" in your vagina mixing with his penis. Everytime I have an orgasm it always does that right after. Its a very awkward noise but obviously we're not alone! When you or your boyfriend have an orgasm clean yourself off. Maybe it won't make that noise anymore.|`|d35bf4def6e24268aa25e5adb0dabfabaa	he is pumping so hard you are like a bicycle pump together. only you are filling up with air. when you move about afterwards the air escapes|`|vFsQZL5Faa	try getting on top before your done, it might let all that air out.  i have that problem too, if i do it doggie style or upside down for a long time...it's totally normal....|`|ELEEe5Fhaa	Vaginal flatulence (flatus vaginalis in Latin) is an emission or expulsion of air from the vagina that may occur during or after sexual intercourse or (less often) during other sexual acts, stretching or exercise. The sound is somewhat comparable to flatulence from the anus but does not involve waste gases and thus often has no specific odor associated.|`|zBKjUTyNaa	Aww,   okay honestly.  this is totally normal.    I can get into details for you, since you dont know me and i dont know you what is there to worry about?    When you're going at it hard, your 'part' loosens up right?   So when he pulls out fast, your 'part' is still opened very wide and subject to almost anything so it just sucks in air.  It's emabarassing, but it's natural and it's not like it smells and it's coming from your bum right?    This happens to me ALOT.  Mainly when doing doggy-style because you're right out there right?  the harder you go, the more air goes in.    My suggestion would be that if you still have sex fairly rough, try and make sure he doesnt take his penis out of you until he's ready to pull out and not go back in.  The whole; in-and-out method causes this.    When he fully pulls out after he's finished, make sure your legs are closed together and what not and just do it slowly and walk it off.|`|SUt0S43Taa	Same thing here. it's trapped air and mostly all of doesn't come out all at once, after you go to the bathroom and pee, you put pressure down there the rest comes out.|`|9H90ud06aa	it IS actually air. sometimes when you're having intercourse in certain positions it can cause air to go up inside of you and to make a "fart" (or qweef/queef as it's more commonly known) and this often happens after intercourse because the air can be trapped really high up. as long as your partner isn't making a big deal about it then it's no concern. it's perfectly normal and the only reason for you to change positions is if it embarrasses you or if it's uncomfortable.|`|TweZlF73aa	It's a release of built up air from the constant pushing and pulling of you and your boyfriend when you stop your mussels relax and you queef or fart out of your... "private area" Totally normal, hope i help.|`|brSfRLspaa	I can't believe you're having sex and don't know what a queef is, I figured out how to do them when I was like 14|`|1BddUQxIaa	i have that problem too! when my boyfriend pulls out too hard, i really fart!|`|sSEy6KYiaa	The vaginal muscles have a sucking motion which  is designed to suck the penis further in during sex and to help move sperm up the vaginal canal after ejectulation to aid fertilisation.    hense the sucking farty sound when he pulls out - its the air being sucked into a vacum space that you hear.|`|MhpccWpmaa	you were right before--it's just air that gets caught up in there during sex. it's normal for it to happen during or after sex so don't worry|`|HhY4Oul2aa	ummm not sure but mine sometimes does that to|`|Run7dyraaa	I had that problem too. It's just air getting caught in there. Well, just think if your boyfriend farts too, you can fart together. Have fun.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	That's called a "queefe". It's not uncommon, just a little embarrassing.|`|xreWOKBYaa	it's called a Queef  and it is trapped air escaping your vagina    have him not pull out as much each time he thrusts it will keep air from getting in|`|CNSGz12zaa	It is called a qweef.|`|FcNOkHquaa	It's called a quief, it's perfectly normal......  It's just from his penis pushing the air into your vagina, it shouldnt happen everytime but every once in awhile it will, it's just the air coming out....    /m|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	You're queefing lmao.|`|RvddYKqjaa	It's a very normal thing. I am not certain of the correct name since I've only heard it referred to by an X-rated name.|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	It's called a ***** fart lol. That means air entered you during intercourse. It is also known as quiff.|`|VrR9ojRRaa	A fanny fart...quite normal!

I'm sure it's fine.|`|pjYQhPPBaa	It's a queef. It's essentially a vagina fart. It's nothing to be worried about. It's just air build up in your vagina, because really, you're getting air pushed in then out when you're having sex. A lot of girls get it. My friend gets it when she's having sex; I get it after I orgasm, or when I have my period, oddly enough.|`|cgomb6Dwaa	just say o yea boy. this is hard core. let me now do a blow j**. huhuhuh yea boy!?!|`|WpqfQOTJaa	it's called a queef.

I know its embarrassing but it happens sometimes...|`|LXK8ktGOaa	when you have ex its just the air that went in coming out lmao|`|aOxwt667aa	don't do it hard then XD it must be a good time for you. Tell your boyfriend to relax in the in and out.    Procedure:    (slowly)  In..  and out...    In..  and out...    In..  and out...    In..  and out...  etc...    also, its a queef|`|8pTML1F9aa	Possibly a queef|`|NWHTZauzaa	its called a queef a fart from your private area. No joke. lolz :)|`|H7kmp0qdaa	lol it's called a queef.

ufgv7oTjaa	If it's that old, you'll want to throw it out.    Even when properly dried, herbs lose much of their potency within a few years... a little longer if they are stored outside of an oxygen environment, but not that long anyway. It's similar to cereal in the cupboard... it gets stale eventually. I wouldn't use them after 3-4 years time myself. Besides, a 30 day cleanse wouldn't cost all that much anyway. ;-) Good luck!|`|YrNr017haa	should be ok; follow directions exactly; though !
piI1aWOdaa	your freaking out yes.. he doesnt have HIV ..if your worried about his health get him to a doctor|`|396e0df85e9b2414f391d81a9892f542aa	I can tell you that freaking out is only going to make dealing with this worse.  If you are worried then you should of course get tested because chances are if he has it then you could have it also.  Don't get so freaked out.  HIV is not a death sentence anymore.  People with HIV, in this day and age, will probably die from something other than AIDS.      There are some other signs you can look for when it comes to looking for signs...night sweats (Im talking about sweating so much his clothes would be soaked) and swollen glands, rash, weight loss, and thrush (which is a white film that covers the insides of your cheeks and on your tongue).   Dont take any chances.  If you think he may be sick then you should encourage him to go with you to get tested.  Tell him it's for extra credit in school, tell him whatever you have to and get him in for testing.  It can take up to 12 months for HIV to show up on a test but most people will test positive in 6 months.    good luck and take care...I hope your b/f feels better.

exMPHWKHaa	Haha you will not overdose on 600mg of benadryl. You will have a wild trip though if those are 100mg pills and start hallucinating tell us how it goes!|`|xCfub799aa	Most probably OD yourself...    That's a bad idea.    An overdose can kill you, chances are you can get your stomach pumped at the hospital to save you but if you're not found in time well...    EDIT: You're going to do it!? I'm sorry are you suicidal!    Don't do it, that is completely stupid, do you really want to kill yourself.|`|cumnSTuvaa	You can OD on Benadryl.|`|MOjHSquwaa	Yeah... I am 24, and weigh about 115.  I take 2-3 and they knock me out for a few hours... You really should only take 2 being 15.|`|wB1EjmBnaa	No!!! Never overdose on any pill. All drugs work correctly only if taken correctly. To take 6 all at once will be extremely harmful to you.|`|5oz4m5p4aa	Why in the world would you want to take all 6 pills at once? That is 3 times the recommended dose and is considered as an overdose. If anything, I think you could get away with taking 3 pills. You should see a doctor about your allergies since the recommended dosage of Benadryl doesn't work for you. For now, I suggest you follow the directions on the box until you can get a Pharmacist's or a Physician's opinion.    Ok you want to know what will happen? Well, you'll probably hallucinate and feel incredibly drowsy or who knows maybe you could die from taking that much. I wouldn't take the chance just to "find out what happens." That's just stupid.  Benadryl isn't meant to be used the way you are curious of using it. That is drug abuse. You probably aren't even supposed to take that many pills in one day. And you probably won't be able to go to school tomorrow either.
t9Nw86Plaa	You sound constipated; the best remedy for this is to modify your diet. Try eating a lot of wholegrains (ie. oats, bran, etc), fruit and vegetables, and cut back on the sugar and fat. Within a week your bowel will be back to normal!|`|AA10460376	Stop eating so much GASY FOODS!......You must be Lacto-Intolerant or something. From now on just monitor everything that goes into your body to try and find out what is causing all of this unnecessary POOPING!    But these are over the counter medications that you can use:Pepto Bismol, Mylanta, Alka Seltzer and the best remedy is from my Grandma....A teaspoon of Baking soda in half a cup of warm water.....Now that cures al GASTRIL PROBLEMS!...    Looking on the brighter side....I think that it is better for it to come out than staying inside....Consider yourself blessed.....|`|yXDtGo8taa	More thank likely you are constipated in which you have trouble actually going. It can also result in these feelings, they happened to me before too don't worry about it it isn't serious. You need to eat more vegetables and fiber but don't overdo it.|`|2gdWeMRfaa	you should change your diet if you consume a lot of junk food because th ehigh amount of fat and artificial chemicals in junk food can make you bloated and feel uncomfortable, if u do not eat a lot of junk food it can be due to constiption or you just have a fast digestive system|`|GQfQ0TsDaa	lol i used to have that problem when i was sick. it was like diarreah, except nothing came out. i suggest taking an anti-diraheealll medicine.

LvnEbqxAaa	One time that happened to me except with my shoulder. It turned out to be chronic tendinitis. I would recommend stretching your arms and back every day, it might loosen those muscles and help the neck pain. Also try putting heat on your neck and see how it feels after that. The best thing I could recommend if that doesn't work is physical therapy. Don't see a chiropractor again; they aren't real doctors and don't know anything about medical problems. They don't help.. they just make it feel better short term but make it worse in the long run. Hope this helps.    Edit -  Please don't listen to these people who are trying to diagnose you over the internet. They think they are doctors or something. You should see a doctor, but it doesn't sound like a tumor >.>|`|fusIwst4aa	I have the same thing, it huts really bad, but,i think it was from the pyrimids we  did, my fried grabbed my neck, and it hurt or days, Maybe it will go away mine did, good luck.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	Just go to the f**king doctor.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Try taking long hot baths in Epson Salts. The Epson Salts really help. And-or try an electric blanket or a heating pad too. The hot water and the heat will help.|`|HA2IV3r3aa	Well, there are many things that can be wrong with you so it's kind of hard to give a good diagnosis over this.  Chiropractors didn't help because they aren't medical doctors.  But depending on what is wrong with you, doctors could do anything from physical therapy to surgery.  But if it is bothering you that badly, you need to go see a real doctor.|`|AA10744471	Since a chiropractor had not helped your condition, then it is time to see a medical doctor to correctly diagnose your condition. For all you know, it is only a minor mis-alignment or a pinched nerve that could be adjusted and relieved with painkillers. But it is very necessary to see a doctor since you are in so much pain. Please see him/her now. Good luck to you.|`|Dea2ZJyAaa	Tell it to get a job :)|`|XL9CUrp2aa	sounds like a slipped disk, you need to get it checked out or it will get worse.  My mom had pain like this and that is what she had.    Theyll take x rays and probably prescribe you an anti-inflamatory drug to see if that helps.    If it doesn't then you may need surgery.|`|bmEV62gyaa	i think you should check out a doctor,   i know if your scared it will be the right and safe thing to do,  please go see a doc :(|`|KSWeYE4haa	You should move ur neck little by little and if that doesn't work go get an X-Ray u might have a neck tumor
xqtS3rWAaa	Honestly, you're not going to be motivated every single day, no matter what. There is going to be one bad day when all you want to do is plop down on the couch and eat chips.    So you need to be organized. Get all of the foods you crave out of your house. Unplug your tv or whatever makes you inactive. Write realistic goals down in a journal. (i.e I will lose 10 pounds by the end of the month, i will go to the gym 3 times a week, i will only eat junk food a few times a month) Write down the good things that will happen if you lose weight. Not just ''i'll look good'' or ''people will like me'' or '' i will be happy'' write things like: ''I'll be able to keep up with my friends'' or ''i'll have more energy''    Importantly, write things down for when you're not feeling motivated so you can read them at those times. (eg. i'd feel much better if i ate an apple instead of a bag of candy, if i exercise now, i can watch my fave tv show later.''    Most of, all persevere. =)|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	It's tough but  here's a suggestion : If you live with  your mom or sisters or brothers tell them  that you want to control  your cravings and when they notice you eating too much have them say stop or remember  the hot bikini body.   I am a guy so I have the opposite problem I cant gain weight for almost nothing. But I did gain 3 lbs recenty but thats nothing. I can eat anything I want  as much as I want and still won't gain the 20 lbs I want to gain. I work out  at the gym too trying to get muscle mass.  Keep yourself motivated by finding another  girls picture in soem magazine that has a hot bikini body already   Tape or pin it up  on the wall or  your fridge.  But cover the  girls face if you don't wanna look at her face.  Keep looking  at her body and that  should motivate you into  working out and getting that hot bikini body you  are after ! I know it's  odd ideas but I tried  to help ya out  yo !!
rcZWsfHdaa	Hm yes most probably..especially if you take a multivitamin supplement pill as they have all vitamins you can possibly have in them (well some do).    However...if you don't eat you don't get the other things your body DESPERATELY needs (including but not limited to sugar/glucose and salt etc).    Also...too many vitamins can cause severe diahorrea so please don't go mad on them. Oh and it has been proved that eating a good range of foods and taking a few supplements (just one really, keep it low because too many are dangerous) is much much better for you than just taking supplements.|`|ToztjpAsaa	No, there is no "superfood" that will make you brainier.  What is important is having a varied diet with plenty of fresh fruit to provide you with the full complement of vitamins and nutrients. This is particularly important during pregnancy.  By the time you're born it's almost too late.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	Your body digests food better.  Supplements are just that. should be used only when you are not eating properly or boost your activity.  Remember to take your supplements after food as they will be maximised better.   don't forget to eat oily fish like salmon for brain food too.|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	No.  Actually, studies have shown that multivitamins are pretty ineffective.  You need to get your vitamins from food, because that's pretty much the best way for your body to absorb them correctly.
CJvJVNbdaa	it appears to be onycholysis a condition where the nail lifts and moisture gets under into the nail matrix causing a yeast infection you should see a dermatologist for treatment but until then do not put anything sharp under your nail to "clean it out" i know this doesn't hurt but it just makes it worse also use blow dryer to dry nail after showers washing dishes etc|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	From that pic it looks like you have a fungus under ur nail or you slammed it into a car door or something! Sorry about your nail that must really hurt!|`|lrVyr7xBaa	that looks like an onychophagy nail, due to excessive nail biting.
hlq3Eo0haa	the dentist will tie u down in the chair and get this needle as long as your arm and shove it in your gum, then he will get a set of pliers and pull out your tooth but if you lucky enough he will get some cement and put it in your tooth,good luck cause it going to hurt|`|t9Nw86Plaa	If you think you have a cavity, visit the dentist straight away (the sooner you attend to it, the better the outcome will be). Cavities don't hurt to get filled (you will be anesthetized), what DOES hurt is leaving a cavity in your tooth without taking care of it!|`|MXRXG62oaa	go to the dentist and they will tell you.   its no big deal. when i got one filled they put a qtip into this red stuff , then put that on my cavity. it numbed it up and didnt hurt at all!!! the drill sounds scary but you cant feel it. It wont hurt afterwards but it takes about 2 hours for the numbing to wear off!!!|`|HsZp3pSKaa	lol its alright. ive had it done before. it doesnt hurt, they put nobacane in your gums. its about a 2 1/2 inch needle and you dont even feel it. so then you go numb. while they are drilling, you feel a slight pressure and like...dust, so to say goes around. then they just kinda stick the stuff on the once-was cavity. your numb for the next couple of hours and after that, your tooth only hurts for like a day or two|`|5Kt8qlytaa	The most painful part is the getting the Novocaine, sometimes the doctor will give you laughing gas so it won't be that bad.  It's not really as bad as you think.|`|x6lxab67aa	Im not sure how much it actually costs, but it doesn't hurt really...  They numb you so you can't feel it, and in my experience, they've never hurt afterwards. It's just annoying because you can't keep liquids in your mouth for a few hours. It just drips down your face onto your clothes... haha
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com|`|uqRb9tAqaa	Drink lots of water  Eat less than 200 carbs a day (carbs are in EVERYTHING)  Eat 1,500 - 1,800 calories a day  Exercise and do cardio at least 4 times a week  Walk and bike everywhere you can  Don't eat late at night, before you go to bed  Don't eat dessert or soda  Avoid eating too much bread  Eat lot's of fruits, veggies, fish, whole grains, beans, ect.    Inside workouts you can do if you don't have a gym membership...  Buy a yoga ball and bounce around on it, or look up exercises online you can do with it. When you're on the computer sit on the ball, so you burn more calories.  You can do lots of toning exercises either with handweights, or just thinks like crunches, squats, and leg lifts to help you tone your muscles.  For cardio inside you can do jump rope, jumping on and off of a platform, running up and down stairs, or doing some punching and kicking in the air.    Good luck and congrats on the baby! I just had my baby girl 3 months ago too, i'm also trying to shed some pounds.    xoxo|`|9OFEj10uaa	i was 160 but now im 134 and all i did was not eat the food i ate no mater if i craved it...if u crave something chew a peice of gum it gets rid of cravings=)|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	Barry's Bootcamp is actually an amazing workout for at home and it comes with a meal plan.    I swear this isn't spam, it just actually helped me and I genuinly think it's a great plan.|`|or8RGV6Eaa	Doing crunches,walking in place,or lifting water bottles in each hand during commercials helped me to lose weight.|`|aFcEMbihaa	well make sure you are consuming less than 3500 calories a day because it adds up to a pound.  Try to keep a list of how many calories you consume daily and work on reducing it.   remember your body consumes calories just keeping you alive so don't cut out too many.   Avoid consuming fat since you want to burn the fat already present in your body.    I'm 5 ft 11 inches and consume 1,500 calories a day.  i eat small amounts of food every time my stomach growls and substitute a few meals with healthy cereals and drinks like ensure or slimfast.
d1jMmApmaa	It really doesn't matter how many partners you've had.  Only one has to be infected to transmit an STD/STI.  The best way to protect against infection is to get yourself and your partner tested prior to having sex and to use a latex condom every time you have sex with anyone regardless of appearance.    Examples using HIV as the STD/STI:  A) Jane has sex with 30 men who all appear healthy.  All 30 men have been tested and received negative results for HIV.  Jane uses latex condoms with every man, every time to minimize her risk.    B) Lucy has sex with 1 man who appears healthy.  He has been tested and received a positive diagnosis for HIV.  Lucy does not use condoms because she only has sex with 1 partner who is also monogamous.    In these examples: Jane will not contract HIV from her exposure with these 30 men because none of her partners were infected.  Lucy will likely contract HIV from her exposure with her 1 partner because he is infected and they used no protection.    The same examples also work with STD/STI's other than HIV.    Get yourself and your partners tested & always use a condom.  It's the best protection plan available.    Of course, abstinence is 100% effective but taking proper precautions works pretty well for the rest of us.    Good Luck!|`|iPp6UZKraa	You can't always tell when someone has an STD. Actually in alot of cases there are no signs of one. If you have protected sex you lower the chances of getting an STD but you still have a chance of getting one. Condoms don't cover all of your skin and you could potentially get Herpes or HPV or if the protection is not used correctly it opens up other possibilities.|`|AA11080047	people can go with several partners and not get infected. but if one person ase a sexually disease then it will be transmitted.
UZxeBrxQaa	Lots of potential causes here.  Low blood iron.  Low blood sugar.  Viral disorders can cause such lingering symptoms.  There are also systemic disorders to be considered, such as diabetes.    You need a complete blood panel done, and examination by a physician.
UOZP4Ma5aa	Not for crowns but for root canals yes, its not for you to swallow anything its to keep the working field clear of saliva
YgzpSbxdaa	Diabetes can play all sorts of havoc with your body. Especially when it comes to circulation and blood pressure. I found a link which explains what causes an enlarged heart and what the risk factors are. It was the most basic one I could find, the rest all had medical jargon that I would use to talk to doctors. It could be a sign of heart failure. Where if the heart becomes too big, it becomes 'floppy' and does not work as well. But that is worst case scenario and there is surgery for that anyway.
HA2IV3r3aa	This isn't a question and it doesn't make any sense.
d1jMmApmaa	The symptoms you described sound a bit like chlamydia and gonorrhea.  Both can cause sterility and PID if left untreated and neither disease resolves on its own.      She could try going to Planned Parenthood.  Many PP locations have a program that covers the cost of medical examinations and treatment for people who could not otherwise afford it.    If you truly suspect rape, you may want to contact Child Protective Services as the rape would have occurred approximately 3-4 years ago at age 16-17 which would make her a minor in many states at the time of the offense.  That would open up a whole host of possibilities for financial help for her medical bills including counseling to help her work through issues that arise from the trauma of rape.      Also, in most states, the victim doesn't have to pay out of pocket to be treated for medical conditions as a result of rape especially when the victim is/was a child at the time of the offense.  She should seek help as soon as possible.      Also, if she chooses to mention rape or molestation when seeking help, she should know that the statute of limitations in some states is as little as 5 years.  So, depending on where you live, she may want to hurry up and report the incident.  Either way she should seek help for her current symptoms.|`|wQJtKx6zaa	I do not have a medical background,but I have common sense. Find  your nearest clinic and take her asap. They can work out the money issues at a very low and affordable cost. By ignoring the problem, she could risk becoming sterile or decrease her chances of catching signs of uterine cancer early that can affect women at 20.
AA11595906	I had a script for that once.  It did nothing but make me feel sick, I wouldn't recommend it.|`|0JERmAslaa	no just take it|`|JRUItDKsaa	do to it|`|GuOJIftAaa	lol so now people have to take pills to live life a bit? Wow, grow up and try different positions instead. How old are you anyways? I'm only 18 and know better than this.|`|YYsldZcYaa	Done that.    Its nothing special though.    Vikeys are nice for making him last slightly longer and making her roll over and fall asleep before he can get it up...  Don't have high expectations.|`|DkVofG9paa	makes you a little floaty... it reacts to each person different.  me personally.. makes me feel sick if i dont eat.  having sex on it is fun.. it's normal.. you'd be fine..|`|NSf16kWmaa	idk if its th ebest idea. somne people have different sideeffects  like my brother after he got his wisdom teeth removed the dentist perscribed it to him and he was crazy. at first he didnt know his name, then he was really emotional, it was really weird|`|2gdWeMRfaa	sounds like fun! i would eat before and drink some water, and i would try half a pill first, no alcohol-GOOD|`|BIyiOgPYaa	one pill won't do anything to effect your mood or reactions or anything like that. it may make you sleepy (i think that's one of the side effects, not too sure though), but other than that it won't do anything to alter your mood.     although if you have vigorous sex, then you won't be sore afterward for a few hours.|`|vYhnKB5Baa	not vicodin. try it on x

J52VbUPraa	Give it time, weed doesn't actually damage brain cells unlike what you may have heard and unlike alcohol (which only does if you drink enough). Just wait, depending on how much you used to smoke, it'll be good in a couple of days to a month at MAX|`|PEw6Z3mEaa	These friends are really dumb, but are HALF right. No brain cells do not grow back, when they are gone they are gone. BUT... weed doesnt kill brain cells so you have nothing to grow back. Its actually been proven that it doesnt kill brain cells, and its never been proven to cause any disease at all.|`|ypqoFDSqaa	Weed doesn't mess with your thinking . If you have trouble thinking then that is from something else. You are just feeling the withdraw sytoms which will be gone in 28 days. And be out of your system by then. People are wrong , People only talk bad about weed because that is what they were taught.|`|9sxY4ZbZaa	You'll probably start thinking more clear in maybe a couple days, but it could take up to 2 weeks? Brain cells dont grow back i dont think. Your memory will probably improve if you work on it more and more.|`|nQ6RZJs0aa	Marijuana doesn't do any permanent damage. It does not kill brain cells (that's a myth).    All marijuana does is impair your short-term memory while intoxicated. You should be completely normal in a few days.
H2QdsL9raa	Yes you do|`|NE3vbxHNaa	yes
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	No.  It just gives you something else to think about.|`|LHzlvfRQaa	Only you can answer that question. Cutting is anger turned inwards so why don't you read some books on healthy ways for anger management. A healthier way to release all those pent up emotions, and anger, would be to write your feelings down on paper, in a poem, or take up whittling or woodwork, or painting. Slash a paint brush around on a piece of paper, in a modernistic, impressionism, abstract art work, so as to release all your emotions.    Join a club/hobby class and meet people who share the same interests as yourself, such as,maybe, writing, or painting. Join a beginners class and learn how to paint. That way you will meet new people and make new friends.  Cutting is an addiction like any other addiction, so write the telephone number of a help line on your arm, and phone them, whenever you get the urge to cut, because there are people there, waiting to talk to you. They will give you advice about where to go for help. You are a good person and deserve to be happy. So start showing yourself and your body more respect. I care. :-)))|`|UVdviQMPaa	Yes it does. The pain of depression|`|NiBXgbM2aa	no|`|zRlDQ9JJaa	I cut myself and it takes away the pain for me, but then again I don't think you want people against you|`|HA2IV3r3aa	No, it causes more pain.  You are cutting your skin which a healthy body interprets as danger and sends a pain signal to your brain.  All it does it signify that you are a whiner who is unable to deal with your problems.
70395216e5322fd02a2614cfd1f5d3f8aa	Have a lot of fruit. During the summer you get a lot of Vitamin D/C from the Sun. These Vitamins help you stay 'happy' in a way. So have fun with all the oranges =D|`|xRiw0uBCaa	What you are describing sounds like Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD. I lived in a part of the country where this condition is prevalent. Try a sun lamp. The bulbs are made to simulate the properties of sunlight, and can be quite effective.|`|p0zA0zyHaa	Get a sun lamp.  I think that is the term for it.  It basically simulates sun light.  One of the major causes of SAD (Seasonal Affect Disorder) is a lack of sun.
RGvNRH8Iaa	They really are not much more uncomfortable than a normal filling.  The worst part when I had them was the shots because mine were in my top teeth, so I had to get shots in the roof of my mouth :(  But once you get thru that part it really isnt so bad.      The dentist will drill into the tooth and use metal file type things in the root canals of the tooth to clean them out.  If the dentist feels the tooth needs it, they will put metal posts into the roots of the tooth to make it stronger.    Once all that is done they fill the canals and usually they will put a temporary crown on the tooth, and your friend will have to get a permanent crown placed in a few weeks (without one the tooth could break later).
V4LktEAoaa	No being sick does have to do with your period.|`|iKYNUni0aa	yup|`|9nrJSRNTaa	yes.|`|F4DhYjlnaa	Yes - Anything that is physically taxing on your body can cause a delay in your period. This can include illness, stress, or a rigorous exercise program.

8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|G1OSlub8aa	Ok..since your 18 years old and seriously dont know the answer to this basic anatomy question..here is your answer.<br>  <br>  Here is what you need to do to get taller. Its a 3 part plan.<br>  <br>  #1- Stand on one foot and spin around in a circle yelling "grow leg grow". You need to do this on each leg for 23 minutes a day 6 days a week, if you do it on the 7th you will actually shrink. <br>  <br>  #2- Every day consume this drink...mix 1 eyeball of a virgin unicorn, 1 hair from a bald toad and some skim milk<br>  <br>  #3- This is the most important part, you need to travel to downtown Cleveland, preferably at midnight and look for a guy named Joe. Joe will tell you his actual name is fred, but that doesnt matter. Joe will give you a reddish blue pill that has been colored green. Take this pill and use it as a suppository when the clock hits 12:09 am. After you do this thank Joe ( fred actually) and do three cartwheeels southeast down the street.<br>  <br>  <br>  Idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oa3Y7Xltaa	I'm your height and 14 but I come from a tall family, listen man a lot of people don't stop growing til there 21. My brother was 5'10 and went up to 6'3 within a year and a half. <br>  <br>  Height is all on genetics really, and trust me you've got what 3 years left of growing if your like most people, so don't worry you will most probably reach your wanted height.|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	Are you the same CJ that terrorizes the R&S category?
0lCnu1g2aa	Sounds like it needs to be xray'd as soon as possible.  For now you could apply ice to area, and make a splint of some sort out of a small pillow or bath towel wrapped around your arm  and some duct tape to secure it.  You should also be taking ibuprofen or tylenol for pain and keep elevated.|`|ACMPEzqQaa	Fixing it would be a good idea, use http://hubpages.com/hub/Speed-healing-of... to do so.
ng8ILmkOaa	the very best thing you can do is sleep for at least 8 hours, bcoz baggy eyes come from lack of sleep and stress. In our tradition, we put honey under the eyes, but I doubt that'll work if you don't sleep......my mom has them, whenever I wanna joke around about it I tell he "oh mom get some sleep will ya? I can go shopping with those bags" and she get's all cranky about it hahahahahah LMAO|`|JXH8SDqOaa	I think so. Sometimes I get bags under my eyes, and sometimes I get dark circles. I don't know what the difference is.|`|1L5Uq3voaa	Yes. And you can only get rid of the with sleep or makeup (temporary cover-up).|`|CJvJVNbdaa	unless your eye bags are genetic probably from holding fluid which sometimes happens when you are tired.  try putting preparation h on your under eye bags to decrease the size.  i know sounds weird but has worked for me many nights after i went out too late and too long and had to work in the morning
c55O7jqXaa	Well no dentist can tell you what tooth it may be or whether it is sensativity or a cavity that has gotten to the root.      I just suggest going to the dentist and getting an xray done and letting them do an exam and go from there. Don't fool around and let this go. Pain is your bodies way of saying- "Heh look buddy something is wrong and I need to be fixed".     You are gonna be in more pain and cost you more money and possily loose a tooth if this continues.
6UATnt3laa	I'm still a teen, and yes I'm depressed.  I'm 17.  For a few years I had extreme ups and downs starting in the sixth grade, probably due to crazy hormones.  Over the past two or three years, my depression has become very severe.  I see a psychologist now, and five months later, I'm finally starting to allow him to help me. My mood swings go from extremely timid and shy, to extremely depressed, to feeling numb and "ok".  I have cut myself and still do.  I have a really bad relationship with food and go from overeating all the time to starving myself and working out like mad, so my weight is fluctuating. I haven't been admitted to a hospital, but my therapist has suggested it a few times. One of these days I think I am going to take him up on the offer.  I don't really know what you were looking for, but I hope I answered your question.|`|ILZY7BD0aa	No I was too stupid to be depressed|`|mBUfy9zMaa	Im 18 and was diagnosed with depression last year.  I guess it was bad enough for someone to take notice, because my school called my mother and put me in counseling.  I also started cutting last year, because I was abused as a child and was reliving everything so I needed some way to relax, and cutting helped.  I did have mood swings, a ton of those.  My first therapist actually diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder, but my mom disagreed with her and I was sent to a new therapist, one who diagnosed me with Depression and Anxiety, shes currently working with me on bringing back some of those childhood memories (fun fun) and I really like her.  Anyways, I hope I helped some, any more questions just ask.|`|RnjTgp2daa	No.  But if you're feeling those symptoms, definitely seek professional medical care.  Good luck!|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	No but when i was 12 i had extreme depression and a eating disorder i think.

No.  No.  Yeah.|`|qHCtBq07aa	I still have depression to this day and its almost been about 5 almost 6 years.   It has lasted forever, times seem to get better but in the end I end up wallowing in depression and it sucks.   I was admitted to a hospital because I did cut but it was because of a misunderstanding and I lied my way out of there because I didn't plan on staying longer when at the time, I had no fresh wounds or even wounds that were healing.   I had/have severe mood swings to the point where I'm yelling at someone one minute, to being happy a split second later.|`|EjdOItfEaa	I used to be very depressed as a teen and still at times now not as bad though. When I was a teen anger I was a cutter I liked to cut myself. It felt like it toke some of the pain that was inside me out, like the more I cute the more of my anger/depression would go away. I was put on meds and was sent to a hospital for 12 hours everyday for about 4 months. If you want to talk to me you can send me a friend request if so I will not judge you, you name it I did as a teen. its nice to talk to at least one person when you are depressed I know.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	I had depression as a teenager. I wasn't admitted to a hospital, i never cut :S, i had bad mood swings though! and a bad temper. I have been on a number of medications for it and they exaggerated the depression and made me more miserbale. I'm 21 now and on vitamin therapy from my naturopathic doctor. It's actually helping alot more than I expected. Very subtle but the effects are definetly building!

XRdOfOn6aa	Loss of peripheral vision is a sign of pituitary tumor. That is from pressure on the optic nerve.  When you have a pituitary tumor, you are checked by optic field tests so as to see how the optic nerve is or is not effected.

You can ask to dress yourself though, and only call them in when you re mostly dressed.

You should experiment with out fear.  Feel free to stick it in her woofer and play with her tweeters, but if your stick it in her bass cannon you better wear a condom or there will be little ear buds running all over the place.
aiBLNYhgaa	I don't drink alone at all. I just turned 21, so if I wanted alcohol I had to wait until I went to a party. As for all the things that you want to see happen, you are going to have to leave the alcohol alone when you are upset or miserable. When you are happy, that is fine. The one thing that I said I would never do is mix an emotion with a behavior. So for me that emotion is always sadness and sometimes it can be happy with alcohol. But mainly I meant sadness, cause next time your brain will always equate that emotion with that behavior if you know what I mean. Well if you do it enough times it will.    As for the anxiety all that I can really say is that you are going to have to continuously  expose yourself to the thing that makes you anxious. Take baby steps, even if it is just walking to the store or whatever. Baby steps. If you find that it hinders you then you might want to go speak with someone that can give you better advice then I can offer you if you know what I mean. If you work at it and put the gears in motion then change will definitely come your way.    Even with friends, it is so easy for me to make them. Best thing to start up any conversation is anything that is really big right now. Like the super bowl, or music, or anything. Anything that people can agree on. You can even start a conversation on what you just happen to be drinking. Like let's say that you are drinking Miller Light...whooo hooo! You see a guy sitting next to you you can say something like...I am glad to see that I am not the only real man drinking a real man's beer. Corny I know, but it starts it off. Then you can venture of on other topics, like women. I wish you the best of luck and I hope the good things come your way|`|HKHCuRI8aa	i used to here at house cause i just did, nothing wrong with it.|`|Z92cIMaEaa	Yep, I drink alone sometimes. It doesnt bother me to drink alone b/c its not something I do that much. Usually its a glass of wine to unwind...and then it turns into 3 or 4(hmm, how did that happen? lol). Ive also been to museums, bars, the movies and even clubs by myself. I used to do a lot of stuff solo. Now Im dating someone so I kind of tend to do more stuff with him than alone...but I still really enjoy my alone time.|`|RHuIQdrRaa	i drank my frist time a week or two ago, it was with friends on my way to the movies. i got veryy social lol     thinking about it, the feeling while you drink is real special lol , but i rely dno't wana get addicted to that feeling. idunno haven't rely drank since. i'm 16 , and hopefully i can keep my social skills.     I dunno man, try an meet a friend at the bar play some pool with somebody an theres a friend right there. an jsut go from there.     chicks at the bar might not be the best , but hey theres a friend there too|`|FvmLoso6aa	Drinking alone is a sign of Alcoholism.  Your local AA meeting would help you meet people who can understand exactly what you're going through and help you learn to enjoy your life again.  You may not like to hear it, but it sounds like the drinking has caused problems in your life and to change your life that may need to go.  You can find your local meeting sites and times at http://www.aa.org/lang/en/meeting_finder...|`|7WvWa08Oaa	I rarely ever drink alone, and if i do, its not to get drunk. I find that getting drunk by myself just makes me more depressed. I only really drink with some friends or at parties which i try to keep only on weekends, but sometimes it ends up being during the week too. Finding a job and getting your life back on track might require cutting back, theres nothing worse than sitting at work and all you can do is watch the clock to see when you can leave and get a drink.... and hey cutting back will save you a lot of money too : )  i hope everything turns out well for you, good luck|`|2fc1TfiCaa	I have a similar problem as yours.  Nowadays, I don't drink when I am depressed.  I drink 1 or 2 bottles/glasses when I am in a good mood.  Try contact your old friends, or go to church to know some new friends.  Yes, going to church can lighten your mood, and drag you out of this miserable life.   I am planning to go to church, since I am pretty miserable these days =(   Good luck!! may both of us get out of these miserable lives.|`|ijpU8jSCaa	i drink alone , yes .  how often ? every secondd (if not every) weekendd or so .  i think when im drinkingg , i think a lot .  i think about what a failure i amm , and about deathh .  please add me as a friendd , feel free to  email me , i will replyy .|`|sZhTwzh4aa	well, i don't drink, but i am alone.|`|B24W8w43aa	I used to when I was an alcoholic.

DMxfGWcXaa	drink plenty of fluids (this should be number one on your list), take some sort of nausea medicine (if you went to the doctor, I think they would have prescribed it for you), eat crackers, pretzels and any soap you like, and if you have or diarrhea I would take immodium for it (it's stronger than pepto bismal and there's less of a chance of you throwing it up again)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	You need to get some electrolytes into your body.Ask someone to pick you up some Gatorade or pedialyte.If you cannot keep anything down, try a tablespoon of liquids every 10-20 minutes.    Stay in bed and rest.      Don't eat anything for at least 4-6 hours after your last vomiting bout.    Noro prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|84H5kMD7aa	drink liquids, relax|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	Keep on a light diet, and that should help you.
c51dec46bcea391dd52f1780bec49596aa	many things will be different for the first 3 months. spotting in between is the most common. Nausea, tender breasts, food cravings.    Remember, when taking the pill, the hormones trick your body into thinking you are pregnant..so you may have many symptoms of a pregnancy..    After the third month or so, you should be fine..Although it is normal to have tender breasts while taking the pill or any other birth control that have hormones in them..You might gain a couple of pounds..No more than 5..    You can have sex after your done with your second pack.

b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	dyslexia is not an optical problem lol...    i have very mild dyslexia, but i have gotten better by obsessing over it and being overly careful. it is a mental issue where you transpose numbers or letters so the word you are reading or writing comes out in the wrong order. for me it comes with lists of numbers. what you can do is try the memory games like that game they have on nintendo DS that have you practice remembering certain things in a certain order. i think it seems to help the brain get used to keeping things in a certain order. your right (artistic) brain does not think logically so it may not understand the concept of a sequence. your eyes might read parallelepiped but if your right brain tries to take over the interpretation, it feeds all the letters in at once and you go wtf? i played the games for several days on someone else's gameboy like a year ago and it is weird because ever since i have been less prone to mix things up.    left brain people are better at logic sequences and right brain people are better at nonlinear thinking which helps when you are trying to create something based on old data but that can be a handicap when you need the letters or numbers to form in a linear fashion. try the games, it can't hurt. he also has a lot of other things on his mind so i wouldn't rule those things out of the situation. if he finds a more stable living/life situation he may find it easier to concentrate on other things.    PS - i am also curious how difficult it is for him or any dyslexic person to read "parallelepiped" i love the word because of the musical flow it has but i can imagine it being difficult because of the letter repetitions :P|`|SdJEVO53aa	maybe have him transfer school systems to a more helpful school|`|KuPshIjcaa	Tell him to never give up on education!

wRiabtFjaa	Hey there. My name is Mason Sasaki. I just recently got surgery for my spine on August 26th, 2008. I had a 72 degree curve in my spine and they reduced it to 30 which is mild. But ok here it goes:    When they finally decide that you are going to be getting surgery you will be taking lots of x-rays. First to determine how bad the curve is. The last set of x-rays they do will be called "bending x-rays." Those will help the surgeon determine how many vertebrae will be fused.     Now the surgery is very technical.But what they do is go into your back by making an incision as long as the vertebrae that they are going to operate on. Then they go in a get the muscle off of your spine to actually see your spine. Once your spine is exposed they will do few things. With me they put screws on each side of my vertebrae that are going to be fused. After they get put into your spine they will have rods. Those rods will be perfectly shaped according to your curve. That's why they did the bending x-rays. They will slide those rods through the screws and tighten it. Now as they tighten it they watch very closely as to the way your spine looks. As it gets tightened, your spine will get more straight. But if you look crooked or something they will go in and take out a screw. The more they do that, the more straight you start to look. After they do that, they will sew your muscles back to your spine.     Now with me, before they sewed me up they dropped some medicine on my spine. That made it so i didn't feel any pain for 24 hours. Ask them if they can do that for you. It helps a lot to make that first day better.     But then after they do all that, they will put a drainage tube in your spine to help make it so it doesn't bleed on the dressing. Then you get sewed up and sent into recovery. The surgery usually lasts for like 5 hours or so.     When you wake up you will feel very dazed.You wont be able to stay awake for very long cause of all the anesthesia. The first day will involve a lot of sleeping. You probably won't remember much. People will be coming in a lot to check your vitals and turning you from side to side. That is going to help you be comfortable. The second day they will probably make you sit up. Sitting up is going to hurt cause your back is going to be really sore. But don't be afraid of sitting up cause its all part of the criteria to send you home. Now on the third day after surgery, they will probably will make you stand up. Standing up helps a lot. Everything is going to be very hard at first because your back is going to be so sore. In the end it is all worth it though. Believe me...  Now a very important thing is to take things slow. When you stand up, if you feel light headed or are in a lot of pain. Ask them to let you sit down for a minute.The fourth day after surgery will be standing up and walking. Once again if you feel light headed or in lots of pain, ask the nurse to let you sit for a minute. Now if you have stairs at home then they will make you walk up some stairs on the fifth day. I can not hesitate enough for you to TAKE THINGS SLOW.     In order for me to get released i had to do a few things:  1) Sit up  2) Stand Up  3) Stand Up and Walk  4) Walk up stairs  5) Eat  6) Have A BM( which means you gotta poop)    Now i know having to poop doesnt sound important but it is.    Ok so now ill explain the pre-op. You will go in and get washed up with antibacterial soap. Its going to be cold. You will have to be wearing scrubs or a gown. If you get too nervous they will end up giving you some medicine to calm you down. People will be coming in and talking to you about your surgery. Asking if you have some last minute questions or something. Then you head into the operating room. You lay down and they get you comfortable. Then they will put the mask on you and turn on some "laughing gas." Once you are relaxed, they will turn on the anesthesia and you will fall to sleep within 10 seconds. You will hear  them talking to you.     Once you pass out they will hook you up with IV's and a catheter. A catheter is a tube they stick into your bladder so you be peeing all over during surgery. That catheter stays in until you can walk to the bathroom yourself.    Then they do the surgery and i already explained that.    Now about the pain.... you will be hooked up to lil machine that makes it so you can give yourself medicine every once in a while. All you gotta do is press a button and it will release some medicine.    There will be pain. But if it every gets too bad then tell your nurse and they will give you some stronger medicine. Dont be afraid to speak up cause if you dont then you will be in more pain. So always tell them how much pain you are in.    But yeah that is the whole surgery. I actually have a binder full of information on the surgery. So if you have anymore questions than let me know.    killkenny4@aol.com    Mason Sasaki|`|8WYWEDOpaa	I've posted the following a few times for other people with questions. I hope I'll answer the things that have you concerned.    Let me talk about the hospital stay.    You'll have meds to help with the pain. You'll start out with stronger meds and then wean yourself from them over time. So, yes, it does hurt, but you shouldn't be left hurting.    The size of your scar depends on how many vertebrae need fusing and the technique used to do the fusion. A four-level fusion will have a smaller scar than a 12-level fusion. Some surgeries (probably not yours) need both anterior and posterior (A/P, or front and back). Lastly, some people may be candidates for "minimally invasive" techniques. So, this is a hard question to answer without knowing more about your situation.    Your hospital stay will probably be between four and seven days. Teens typically heal quicker than adults and so their hospital stay is less.    As for what they do, each case is different. Here's one possible scenerio. Its incomplete as I'm describing things pretty quickly. The amount of time spent doing things will probably differ. Maybe even the order that things are done will differ. But it will give you kind of an idea of what happens. Just take it with a grain of salt.    You'll arrive at the hospital early to check in. You'll change into your gown and get an IV hooked up. You will talk to your nurse(s) and perhaps a couple of other staff members. You'll then get put to sleep (injected through the IV that you had put in earlier). The operation then happens. You'll wake up, probably in the ICU, but possibly in your hospital room. Probably on the first or second day after surgery, you'll be shown how to sit and then stand. You'll be able to take walks up and down the hallway but you'll tire quickly. Your IV will be removed in a couple of days as will the catheter you've had in you since the surgery. You'll be allowed to go home once your stomach starts rumbling, you're eating, and going to the bathroom. When you are in the hospital, your scar will be checked by a doctor each day.    You will feel like a truck ran you over for the first couple of days. Once your body starts to recover, you'll feel better.    When you wake up from surgery, your bed will have a machine that gives measured doses of pain meds (morphine or something as effective). You're self-medicating, so if you're hurting, just hit a button. The machine won't let you overdose yourself, though.    You'll be weaned off of the meds from the machine and given oxycontin (or the like). This is what you'll be taking for the first few weeks you're at home.    Bottom line is that you'll be hurting, but you'll be given pain meds to take care of the pain. They'll do the job for you.    It still takes two months to be doing basic things. You'll be cleared to do more things at six months. At one year, you'll be able to do about anything you could do before the surgery. Take it easy. This is major surgery. It takes a while for the spine to fuse.    There's a couple of things, off-topic, that will make life easier for you.     o Make sure you has a robe in case you gets up in the middle of the night when the house is colder. The surgery may mess up your body's temperature control.    o Get a toilet seat extender so that you don't have to squat as far. These also have handles and certainly made my life a lot easier. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.    o It might be nice to get a "grabber" which will help you pick things up from the floor.    o You may or may not have a walker when you get home from the hospital (probably not, but...). I did and discovered that I had to meneuver through the bathroom door sideways because the walker was too wide. This works, but it may be a bit more difficult.    o You will be sleeping an awful lot. This is a combination of your body needing rest and the pain meds knocking you out. Expect it.    o When I was in my bed, my wife made kind of a "nest" with pillows so I wouldn't roll out. I don't normally roll but I think it made both of us feel better. You might want to do the same.    o It will be helpful to sit in a chair with arms when you're having his meals and is sitting at the dining room table. Since your chest muscles are fine, you'll be able to use them to raise and lower yourself.    Please email me if you have questions.

5gG2OfHIaa	From your question,  I gather that you have been experiencing a downhill slide in your sense of happiness, since your 10th grade of high school.   You have one important feature to your personality:  you, at least, know that you are unhappy.  Many people just live and die and never consider whether they are happy.  This may be a difficult sale to you; but, you are examining your life.   That is going to be a major benefit to your long term happiness. You are adjusting to growing from adolescent to adult and from your home to the larger world.  That is quite a bit to adjustment in 5 months.   With your "thanks in advance", you demonstrate manners and consideration of others.  Maybe, you do not need so many friends.  Just a few close friends who are interesting to you rather than a large crew of friends.  The best buddy you should ever seek is that kid in the mirror each morning.  Think well of yourself and that feeling will flow out to the people you really want in your life.  Maybe things can actually go right for change!  If you believe in that idea, it will happen for you.  So, be happy in your fashion.   I am sure that you do not need counseling.|`|2fc1TfiCaa	why don't you go out with your roommate, ask him to introduce some new friends to you; or join as many clubs as you can, sooner or later you will meet some friends.   ask yourself if you really like your school, if not, go find another one.  Dont' make the same mistake I did, my college life was horrible, horrible professors who didn't know how to teach (yeah, asking you to memorize 50+ equations in 1 of the course).  I still have nightmares regarding my college life, I need to see a psychiachist someday.|`|FvmLoso6aa	Your college likely offers some sort of counseling services for students, don't be ashamed to use them.  It is common for them to take on students as patients who have difficulties adjusting to the college life and such.  Your roommate may be a more outgoing person than you, and it would be easier for them to meet people because of it.  Sitting there asking what's wrong may seem like its helping, but doing something about it (like what I suggested above) will do far more good for you in the long run.|`|AA11053543	Hey There.. ok, you will be ok. I was painfully shy in college so i challenged myself and did something really scary, joined the theater group.. i cared nothing about it really, but it was more of an exercise, and it did help me to be more sociable. Also, having study partners in class could kill two birds with one stone.. make friends while studying. Like someone else mentioned though, remember to keep your self-esteem up. I bet you're interesting and funny. Be interested in other people too, and do stay positive even though it may be work work work.. Fake it, and more than likely it will bounce back to you from others. They will like you better cos you're easy to be with and a happy person to be with. Also, dont be afraid to enjoy things by yourself. If you want to go to a concert or something and dont know of anyone to go with.. just GO. and enjoy it. Remember it may be work for a while.. just keep on.|`|6NZeItMAaa	You will, there is no reason. Just take time, work on your self-esteem and smile to people.    Sometimes it takes a little long but everybody finds someone to be friend to, don't be depressed this is not going to arrange things.    By choosing to react to your stress in a positive manner, you can not only control your stress, but you will end up eliminating the stress.     Choose to react to your stress in a positive manner instead of in a negative way and you will achieve positive results.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	I see you have given up already on your resolution, as this is not being positive is it,..You might try having a new hairdo, buy a new outfit, or save up for one. get yourself into gear, as this is the time when you are not doing anything for yourself. Life is for living, and I do not mean going out and drinking like a lot do but other things at your age are out there.If you are in some Clubs well go along and talk to people as it sounds as though you cannot do that, but always waiting for people to approach you.... no, no, no, shake yourself as this is the time when you should savour every moment. Go to it gal !!|`|bEMJSzoeaa	well at least u are in college, and probably u are doing bad for days, but i being in isolation for 6 years thats sucks, well u just have to keep doing the things in life, and soooner or later your are gonna find the good things, i make the mistake of hiding and stoping all things.|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	Just go outside and find someone sitting alone and start talking, hook up with your old friends from highschool go clubbin and meet some new ppl while your there.
WYa3UY6Gaa	Sorry not much you can do unless you can find some better drug. Like oxycodone or Demerol    I have the same problem I have like 4 cysts on one ovary so when that ovary ovulates I get excruciating craps I can't walk/eat/sleep. I had to go to the emergency room every time, because I have a transplanted kidney so I can't take Advil or midol "midol is mostly Advil" Motrin..anything that filters through the kidney I couldn't take so it was unbearable.       So my gyn prescribes me Loratabs every other month.     I feel your pain. GOOD LUCK!!|`|2QrD904Gaa	Oh hun, I'm sorry. I have had this too. All I could do was take a bath, which might not help you because of the heat, and use a heat pad. I also took Midol extra strength and my bf had painkillers that he gave me. Honestly, nothing got rid of the pain, only made it a little more bearable. I made an appointment with my doctor the next day and she put me on Yasmin.|`|WkD9oAUiaa	MIDOL!!!!! Works the best for me. that's my best friend when im on mine!!!|`|juMKsO6laa	Acupuncture... if you can manage to get out of the house... or a massage... or sleep...|`|9da334de0d8258350046544850e0fa57aa	well if heat makes it worse you should try using cold packs, not the kind that gets hard when it freeze, but the kind that keeps the thick gel form. For freezing you can also try Skin Refrigerants. If everything else fails, check with your doctor so he/she can give prescription pain killers.(i know those will help). Maybe they'll give you a big 600mg tablet of something. ^_^ Hope that helps...probaly didnt but oh well i got points, i hope you dont have some underlying problem, probaly more than just cramps|`|6YL7yWfxaa	Midol.    Hope I helped,  ?Meg|`|2hRyB0OXaa	Pamprin Max does wonders for me|`|GYczA6nraa	i use midol.. it works|`|b7t2V8hLaa	maybe you should talk to you GP about it    try painkillers or if heat makes it worse why dont you use a reverse method of cooling??|`|eYwib1leaa	:[ I'm sorry, I have days like that. Pills like Midol don't work for me. I lay on my back and put my hands, or somthing warm with a little pressure where it hurts.. but its not really the heat for me, its the pressure. try to sleep maybe.  I'm sorry if I wasnt a help.  good luck.|`|eKaGmMzTaa	There is a medicine for cramps. I think someone mentioned it, midol i think. It's for women and for cramps. Since your in pain and have been in bed, I think you should call a friend or someone to go to the store and grab you some. Also, try taking a bath. Fill the tub and sit in it. Im not sure if you'd still feel pain since its a hot bath but you might give it a try. But really If i were you, I would call a doctor. 8hours is alot for cramps, I think you should call the doctor and get his/her advice.    Hope you get better soon?|`|mY19PPlIaa	I know what you mean I would throw up from the cramps that's how bad I would have them.  You should take pain killers specific for menstrual cramps like midol or pamprin, also along with that you might want to take a tylenol pm to help you sleep.  I would also take some chocolate, that could put you in a better mood.  Believe it or not but maybe just going out for a walk helps too.  If the pains are so terrible I would go to the ER or call your gyno.
429093af889ade4be8f7e7ce8b917485aa	when you become adult, it might be something unique and appealing for your mate, a special place to kiss :)    In the meantime, maybe you could de-emphasize it with some kind of makeup.  Ask women about make-up because I don't know any details about it, being a man.|`|bH6KAQfiaa	Well pretty much, the only advice i can give you is to take pride in it... because if they know your insecure they know they can get under your skin and make you more insecure about it. But if you just don't care or make it seem cool or something they won't really care. Confidence beats everything.
48Yf8tpsaa	YOu are not eating often enough.. that's your problem... all the body builders down at my club tell me to eat 6 or 7 meals a day... small meals.. healthy food... but often.. this stops you rbody from going into shock and retaining body fat. No joke... you have to eat healthy to lose body fat.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	i have the answer for you but i have to go ..    email me     andrewcothran@gmail.com|`|2gdWeMRfaa	losing weight seems to be a problem for every one except me, i have trouble gaining weight since my metabolism is fast, u probably have trouble because you have slow metabolism, try drinking nothing but water since sugar turns into fat and goes accumalates over the stomach, work out, eat green, cut down on meat|`|PpKJIT0aaa	It may be what you're eating...|`|vkrQ29lOaa	Do you really need to lose weight? What are your height and weight? If you are old enough, weight lifting can help burn more calories and increase your weight in ways you might want to.|`|stWGfFeTaa	the diet sounds fine to me as it is, i dont know proper dieting though. try working out, like push up and sit ups and get some meat in the diet for protein|`|vhCYzBE0aa	You could try yoga or something. I do yoga and it works you out from the inside out. And besides, I also would keep exercising the way you do. Eventually, you'll get results. Running and jogging are good ways to burn calories. And they also strengthen your cardiovascular health.
cf958f585e81f35dda5c9e48e6f15eb2aa	It varies person to person. Some will be fine others drowsy and some will be knocked out by it. The Benadryl you get over the counter for allergies is the same thing given to pysch patients as a mild sedative. There is no difference except maybe the dose given.|`|6SlpdRSbaa	Benadryl has an ingredient that knocks anyone out.  I take only 1 tablet and I'm out, but it does clear up my allergies.  Try taking only 1 tablet if your taking the recommended 2 tablets.|`|8wSFAH8eaa	It does vary from person to person. If you've been sick for a couple of weeks, you most likely don't have a cold. Go get yourself checked out by a doctor and he will most likely prescribe a good medicine for you.
DkVofG9paa	sure it is... they're kids.. i did this with my girlfriends when i was that age.. always sleeping over.. nothing big.  if your wondering if more is going on, maybe you should watch how they interact with each other and see if you notice anything.|`|XZHx3v4Raa	no.im sorry.you might want to find out the real truth.confront him.  he could be GAY.  i hope hes not but lets not make any decisions b4 the whole truth.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Could be worse: they could be out trashing the neighbourhood.    It's possible they like each other REALLY well, or that they are just best mates with lots in common.|`|bEMJSzoeaa	maybe|`|o6uwV66jaa	of course it's fine . .I know lots of people who do that . .    what if it was 2 girls....would you not have a problem with it then . .|`|VLXFPMOqaa	there probably not gay if thats what your impliying   there just hanging out. it does sound obseive but still its just away of them moving from being dependent on the parent to be social and closer to friends     it would be diffrent if they were having "slumber parties " but sleeping over is just away of hanging out|`|ULx2vAB1aa	gay gay gay gay gay. sorry, i don't think it's normal for two dudes to call each other every day. and an 8 hour phone call is not normal. look further into this problem.|`|1MlrO4Uxaa	Its fine as long as he also talks to his other friends - at this age we just want to feel connected to other people.|`|UjhYJHGIaa	It is okay. Let the boy live his life. He deserves to do what he chooses. It only seems wrong because the custom organizes such things to be right and wrong. They are good friends. I have that same case with my friends best friend. If they are happy, you should be happy too.|`|GlnBbf1Eaa	yes its fine, my 19 year old cousin sleeps over at his friends all the time its no big deal there just hangin out probably drinking and stuff.|`|eSiCw6n7aa	theyre fine even if he's gay it doesnt matter because you should accept him for who he is|`|lfEkm7WWaa	okay... ermm how do i explain this. okay well geeeee MAYBE HES GAY face it and don't be mad at your son it's not like he can help maybe having feelings for another guy. or maybe its a bromance.  besides what's the problem with having a good friend even if hes straight.????|`|BPwpQV6faa	they're probably gay,but it's ok..i heard that's the new in thing. All the cool kids are doing it
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Any time that you refuse a recommended treatment, they can ask that you sign a form so that you can not sue them in case of getting sick because you did not follow their recommendations.    best wishes..|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Yes, it is normal practice, and it is to make sure that if you develop cervical cancer in the future you cannot sue or blame your doctor for not picking it up early. Basically, he should have explained all the potential benefits to you, and if you still refuse to have it done, you have to sign the form to say that you understand the risks associated with not having it, and it now becomes entirely your responsibility.|`|0v7Msiznaa	thats a new one for me chickadee coz when i had my first smear test i told them before hand no and before i knew it they did the test on me.  i honestly dont understand that at all.|`|TwK1QsOIaa	he had to have you sign one because if he didn't and you ended up with a disease then it would be his fault. You refused the test so he cannot be held liable for anything that happens, like STD's or infections because you wouldnt let him check.     its your choice to say no, but i would just go through with it. it might possibly save your life.|`|5Kt8qlytaa	First, why would you not want a pap smear?  This test is very effective and necessary for every woman.  Personally, if I were a GYNO and someone didn't want me to perform a pap then yes, I would make them sign a legal doc.  He/She is just making sure that you understand if you opt out of this test and later find out you have cerivical cancer then you can sue him from not catching it.      P.S. You should get a pap smear done.  It really doesn't hurt, and it could save your life.|`|JeFMfTcLaa	i don't no about the paper but you DEFINITELY need a smear test,  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have one, if you stay relaxed it doesn't hurt and it could save your life,|`|vBzVuI3eaa	I had a smear test  one year ago,i have them regular,every three years the last one showed i had abnormal cells of the cervix . the hospital arranged for me to have a colposcopy examination,they said i had pre cancerous cells and i had part of my cervix took away.i have had follow up examinations and so far my smears are clear.it is so important to go for smears it could just save your life.|`|hneetSf2aa	i don't know...but why wouldnt you want one?..they are important ya know|`|3lEMNFFzaa	The form he had you sign is to cover their asses.  A pap  smear is recommended yearly.  Should you discover you have cancer 6 months from now, you can't sue them for not giving you a pap smear test and detecting it early.  You refused.   Just like signing forms agreeing to the consent to be treated, you have to sign for not wanting to be treated as well.....|`|AGcwdZGmaa	it is very important to have so if i was you ild go have one its not that bad|`|627pWyVkaa	I dont know, Most doctors wont give you birth control if you wont have one done and its really irresponsible for you NOT to have one whether your having sex or not, it can mean the difference between finding out you have cancer or not, which is very treatable and good success rate if caught early. But you cant find out if you dont get tested!  And most doctors wont give you birth control if you wont have the test done, its just safe practice and it doesnt hurt it is a little bit uncomfortable thats all.
cDtC6a9Paa	Travel somewhere. This will give you something interesting to talk about. Could be something simple, like a different part of your state, or more exotic, such as Thailand. The more different from what's normal for you and your friends, the more of a conversation topic it will be.     "So what did you do over break?"   "I took the train to Canada and went skiing"  "Oh really? That's cool. How was the snow/ride/food" etc etc.|`|UQXyqgDoaa	Have you ever seen that movie the Yes Man? I think every time an opportunity arises you should just say yes and do it. Don't think about it. Also invite friends over and just do random stuff like make movies and such. My friend has videos on youtube. She can be pretty quiet during school, but get her in front of the camera and she is pretty funny.     http://youtube.com/user/LowProPoProducti...|`|cr8hponkaa	I'm pretty quick witted and always have something to say...    That being said, I somehow manage to always get into trouble.  At the end of the day, most people can not keep up with the quick witted and always ready for the adventure type attitude.    Just be yourself, and get more confidence to go out and meet new people, no one is perfect although most people will pretend they are.       Maybe you just need a partner in crime to hang out with and meet other people.  The more you put yourself out there, you will learn to be charming, and funny.  Like Selena she puts herself out there, in doing so it also invites negativity into the life.     If your bored and in the house... get a job.  restaurants/ retail is a good way to go, you can get discounts on clothing and you can be around people all day,     also "the secret"  movie or book..  its about the laws of attraction you want it to happen think about it send it out into the world and eventually  you will have it.      good luck..don't believe the hype, they all just faking it till they make it
LJlxJdhcaa	4 a 13 year old i think thats big eough  because they will keep growing so just dont worry at all  if u want they to look a little nicer  u should wear a push up bra|`|hlq3Eo0haa	y would u want to stop at 42 d, bras go up to 60 FFFFFF,|`|GYczA6nraa	but your are big enough, im only a 34A!  but you can use push up bras..|`|pZqigkH9aa	There is an excellent web site listed below - mainly for tightening the pelvic floor and vaginal areas but they also sell a cream called Breastique.  It is absolutely fantastic - I was much fuller in the breast in just a couple of days - that was a year ago - will use it forever, no surgery needed!|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Isn't that big enough ?|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Don't worry i'm only 14 and my breast are like 38B's so don't worry they'll grow|`|TudZYPN5aa	I GOT AN IDEA!!!!    You could wear like 4 push up bras at once.|`|k6M48eUMaa	Each morning when you get up, eat a bowl of eggs mixed with vinegar and honey, and repeat three times "I must, I must, I must increase my bust."|`|PAY58zPNaa	wow. you're a 38C and only 13 years old. I'm 13 and like im only a 34 A.  Why would you want to increase to the size of 38D???? 38C is way big for a 13 year old. and 159 is so heavy for a 13 year old, im only like 100 pounds. wtf man? are you crazy?  you think just by having bigger boobs would make people like you? guys hate fat girls.|`|juMKsO6laa	You really don't need bigger boobs. I am 13 and I am barely a 34A and 100 pounds and I am happy right here.
EjdOItfEaa	I was touched as a child as well first when I was 3 by a girl that was 17 and by my grandpa when I was 4. I can't believe your own mother would be st cruel to you I am so sorry. If it is still bothering you like that then I would see if maybe talking with a psychologist would help maybe just talking to someone will help you. I had a different affect then you, instead of not being able to do anything, I felt like if I didn't they would do it anyways. I am 24 now and KNOW I am in charge of my own body. Good luck and I am so sorry that that happend to you and your mother wouldn't be there for you.    Add me if you ever want to talk more...|`|YgzpSbxdaa	Yeah, you need to talk to someone. I know how it feels. My sister and I were molested when I was twelve by someone we called an 'uncle'. He wasn't related to us, but he was our father's best man at our parent wedding and we'd known him for years. Things aren't going to get better by pushing them aside like your mother did. If you see a psychologist then you can talk about it to them, and get the help you need to move forward. If you need medication, they will contact someone who can prescribe it. My sister's boyfriend know that she wasn't ready to have sex with him because she was molested and they are still together. They are even talking about getting engaged.|`|sI5jTpoRaa	holy ****.. okay your mom definately shouldnt have told you to get over it. that is very messed up of her. you need to go talk to a psychiatrist about it and maybe reconcile with your mother. i think it will help you. i know a friend who was only almost fingered by a guy who she didnt want to and this was in 8th grade and now we are in 11th and she is still having problems with it and it didnt even happen. she gets freaked out sometimes and she goes to therapy and i think it helps.|`|NT835TfFaa	I would get a psychologist.  That is so sick!  Especially if you knew him well.  Your MOM needs to go see a psychologist.  That is not something you just get over and forget.  You should explain to your boyfriend and he could help you and he would understand.  You need a really good friend who you can tell, like your best friend.  That is just not RIGHT!|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Your Mother does not seem as though she is much help, so go and have a talk with a Doctor and tell them everything. Try and get a Lady Doctor as you will feel more at ease with her. They are very good and have a lot of understanding with these types of problems. Do not tell your Mother as you are of an age where you need your privacy, and that is what you get off a Doctor.|`|mBUfy9zMaa	Oh sweetie I am soo sorry that happened to you!  I was molested and raped by my cousins when I was 12 years old, it lasted for three years, and Im 18 now.  When someone told me to go see a counselor, I was like, what?  Only crazy people see counselors, Im not crazy!  Ofcourse I started seeing a therapist soon after that, talk about ironic.  But you shouldnt listen to your mother.  Something as traumatic as this, doesnt just go away on its own, you have every right to be upset, and this is obviously affecting you.  And since your 19, you dont need your parents permission to go.  Just go.  Its a big deal, if its a big deal to you sweetie.  Good luck, I hope everything works out alright!|`|FvmLoso6aa	If you find it interfering with activities you should be able to enjoy, such as sex, then it wouldn't hurt to find a therapist to work through things with.  It doesn't need to be a psychologist specifically, Social Workers, Counselors, Marriage and Family Therapists, and even some religious figures have adequate training in therapy to be able to assist you, and if the person did not feel they had the training to assist you they would be right in recommending you to someone they did.
ZWDQbfN0aa	I don't think that it's bad, but when you're gaining muscle, it's important that you eat a lot of protein for faster results. So if you can replace that cereal with a good lean protein packed breakfast, it would work out a little bit better for you.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	You probably need to see your doctor and get some antibiotics if it is draining puss.  If I were having repetitive episodes of infection in my navel which might get into my body cavity, I would let it grow up and not have a navel ring.  Yes, as long as you don't get bacteria in it, you should probably try to keep it open.    good luck..|`|MhpccWpmaa	i've had numerous infections in piercings despite taking care of them. i've always taken warm distilled water in a cup and dissolved sea salt into it. then take the cup and carefully get it to where it's upside down over your belly button while laying on the bed and let it soak for ten minutes or so. once you've done this wipe your belly off and use bacitracin which is similar to neosporin and apply this around both holes of the piercings. do this once a day until the redness and pussing stop. you can also clean it with warm water and apply bacitracin in the morning if you do the process at night. i've never drained the puss before so i couldn't tell you what that does but this has always worked for me in a few days to a week or so. hope this helped!|`|PSI3mNgcaa	omg, i had mine since june 17th and its been 8 months and its still pussing i just use the salt stuff and put back in the one i got it persed with and leave it for like till i see its helping but it takes 1 year to heal|`|r6FS7fCbaa	salt will most likely make the infection a hell of a lot worse. and draining pus is never good. just clean it with eye drop liquid stuff|`|or8RGV6Eaa	If it continues to be infected just remove the piercing.Your body is rejecting it.|`|b7HFB7H6aa	mine never fully healed now it is gone & i have a black dot (scar) You'd be better off without it.
er8hefmSaa	thats normal (: everyone's are a little bit different.|`|h1CNim5Baa	not sure what you mean , but i'm going to guess when they get hard and pointy, that can happen from you being cold.|`|u6btDDWZaa	nothing wrong|`|CwaWiNzuaa	stay in school|`|uWjkYMQpaa	same with me. or if i'm really cold.|`|s1yXI0MAaa	Count yourself lucky. :) Some of us have them a little pointy all the time.    It doesn't sound like anything's wrong with you at all. They stick out when they're stimulated by touch or temperature, and flattish the rest of the time, right? Nothing to worry about.|`|0VMyjRvNaa	Maybe your boobies are too flat? Seriously, when your boobies are perky the nipples kinda grow.|`|pkS7I3soaa	You are fine. Nipples ussually show when you are either cold, arroused or at random times. I suggest padded bras for this reason. believe me...having the guys stare at your **** cuase you're cold isn't fun|`|WrDGhduxaa	that is usually a sign of excitement or arousal.

Nothing to lose alot to gain. Just practice standing up and conquer it.   Email me if you need anything!  -christina|`|5jVNBiw1aa	I've suffered from social anxiety from my early teens up to now at age 30 to one degree or another.  I think the best advice I can give you is sometimes you just have to step outside your comfort zone, that may feel painstakingly awkward, but it will not get better with age unless you address the issue yourself.  I was pretty much a hobbit during college and did not start dating until after I graduated.  I had to force myself into an awkward situation but I benefited because I now am happily married.  Lastly try to make friends and make sure they are people you can talk to when ever you feel anxiety I know my friends won't judge me for it but help me when I feel that way.    Good luck

AA10132967	Take two aspirin and call me in the morning.  No, seriously, it could be arthritis or some other type of inflamation. If it doesn't improve in 3-4 days, you might want to have it looked at.
QnGtN0oHaa	Try tea tree oil. If for some reason you do contract the fungus there are a few simple remedies. The first and probably the most effective that I have found is tea tree oil. In the last few years tea tree oil has become extremely popular and is available in just about any health stores and now in many grocery stores. Or try searching for homeopathic remedies products that will help you to overcome athletes foot naturally.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Athletes foot is bascially bacteria growing on the skin, and comes from the shower pan not being kept clean, and is transferred in locker rooms to others.    It will stay in your socks, so use a little bleach and hot water for the next time you wash your socks.  (don't mix white and colored socks, they tend to bleed the color to the white ones).    Hydrogen peroxide will kill bacteria on contact.  Soaking your feet for 20 minutes a night in 2.5 PH water will also kill the bacteria.  so a misture of 3 ounces of hydrogen peroxide in 20 ounces of warm water will kill the bacteria while you wait.    WHen you are done soaking your feet, you can use this very strong cleaning solution to scrub the bottom of the bathtub or shower - just do not add any soap or other cleaners to the hydrogen peroxide mixture (killer reactions you do not want).  Scrub the shower floor with a old rag, then rinse well before using another soap, or take a shower after the floor has been rinsed for about 2-3 minutes.    I think that I posted this video about 20 times in the past 24 hours.    Here is how they treat eczema in Japan with good results.

Someone who has a  machine might see the add, and supply some water to you for a couple of weeks, to try it out.

XhIYAH6Laa	These days insurance companies will not cover to get your tonsils removed unless you have tonsillitis i think its 6 times in one year...I keep being one short...ugh    The only time you need them to be removed is if they constantly cause problems...like if they are always enlarged or infected...good luck!    and yes, it can also lead to an ear infection!|`|220b497f9a511b5df0fff475b46096ffaa	According to our friends at the Mayo Clinic;  Signs and symptoms of tonsillitis include:     Red, swollen tonsils   White patches on the tonsils   Sore throat   Difficult or painful swallowing   Headache   Fever and chills   Enlarged, tender glands (lymph nodes) in the jaw and neck   Loss of voice (laryngitis)   Abdominal pain in children|`|T12qECtnaa	you get sick a lot over and over again. yes they can cause ear infections
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi     It would help really if you could say just how fast your pulse rate is.    It could just be anxiety, but I am not prepared to say anything for definite as I haven't got all the facts. Things like is this accompanied by dizziness? Pain? Shortness of breath? What is your radial pulse rate (wrist)?    Could you edit your question and give that info sweetheart? Then I or one of the other nurses on this site will be more able to help you.    Love Mel.X|`|HKHCuRI8aa	see Dr. get a bloood test to see whats up, no drugs, relax and be a kid, nothing to stress until you get older ,a house,kids,work,bills,health, etc.|`|MIx1fSbdaa	Why don't you take your heart rate and look up normal for your age group or add it to this question?  Simply count your pulsebeats for a minute.|`|K69z1nXjaa	visit ur doctor... best thing to do|`|eVPW1dwOaa	It could be stress, a side effect of meds, a side effect of recreation drugs, anxiety, ect.

Q4ggnG0waa	Temodar concurrently with radiation. Possibly avastin and maybe even gamma knife.|`|kNvbkZHIaa	Hi    As sad as it is we will all die at some point in time. Medicine has come a long way in recent times and so many now have a greater chance at survival then in previous times. One would think that if there were another way with a great deal of success the doctors would be more incline to try it. Maybe chat with the doctors before they start the radiation process and ask their advice on other procedures that maybe available and any info that has been published on these medical achievements.    Cya  :)|`|LbGmSEkXaa	Cancer is not a disease but a vitamin difficiency. You can try boiling lemongrass and giving her eight glasses to drink each day. Apricot seeds are an alternative if you break the apricot kernel and take the seeds inside. Pound the seeds into crumbs or powder and mix it with some food or drink. Apple seeds also cure cancer.    Radiotherapy is not recommended and I would avoid it if I can. It not only kills the cancer cells but also the healthy ones. This is why many radiotherapy patients end up so weak.     Believe me, such simple herbs and fruits can contain the ingredients to cure cancer and it is barely known. This is because there are more people making a living from cancer than dying from it.    Give it a try, you have nothing to lose. But of course, don't expect the cure effect to happen immediately. Refer to the source page below. I'm sure there are other such pages.

5jf5tcMnaa	You have a mucocele.  If you bite your lip,you might crush a salivary duct.  This damaged duct might swell when the saliva in it has no place to go, and it just bulges up.    check this site out to see if it looks like this;    http://www.visualdxhealth.com/adult/oral...    Most likely it will come and go on its own.  If it gets to be a problem it can be surgically removed.    Another thing you might consider is a Traumatic Fibroma.  This is a thickening of tissue where it is constantly being irritated.  However, since you said it is clear and filled with fluid...that makes it a mucocele.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I am not exactly sure why we get these, but we have all got them at one time or another. I think it could either be from irritation or bitting your gum inside.     They will usually pop open and heal up. I don't think it is anything to worry about unless it was to have colored pus inside of it or spread in your mouth.

7PivTe5yaa	Do they actually have a diagnosis of autism, if so have genetics been ruled out. Old school (remember there is a great deal of on-going research) with a history of autism in the family there was an 10% increased risk. <br>  <br>  If there is a genetic condition that results in a diagnosis of autism or if it results in the individual having numerous characteristics of autism the odds could change drastically. A visit to a genetic counselor might not be a bad idea - rule out conditions such as Angelman, Fragile X or Rett Syndrome. <br>  <br>  If there are female relatives with a history of early menopause, or older relatives with a history of Parkinson Disease or balance/gait problems with dementia I'd make Fragile X a priority to rule out (these are conditions more prevalent in the fragile X carrier population.) Females with Fragile X (carrier or full-mutation) have a 50/50 chance of passing it on with each pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Anyone can have "normal" children and keep in mind we might all define "normal" differently.|`|a98MpjZ9aa	There have been loads of genetic research, but nothing has been found.  There is speculation that some obscure gene complex is involved, but that's grasping at straws, because there is no solid evidence that autism is inherited.  There are too many alternate explanations for anyone to take the genetic issue seriously.  I mean, there is no impirical evidence or inferential evidence that autism is genetic.  When looking at all the available evidence, common sense will inform you that it isn't genetic.  <br>  <br>  Sneezeman is right about the list of things that are associated with autism.  He is just too specific.  Research has shown that ANYTHING that causes a difficult pregnancy or difficult birth makes a child susceptible to autism.  <br>  <br>  You should do some research on the statistical correlations.  Just make sure there is no political agenda involved.  In other words, don't look for research done by DAN! doctors or anyone who is thick with them.

My advice is to go to the Yahoo Groups on autism and ask the parents there what they would do different to prevent their children from getting autism.  You will learn things you won't want to believe because the truth is shocking, but very helpful.  My children no longer have autism, and you could bet if I were to have another, I could guarantee that he/she would not develop autism, because it truly is preventable.  Also, make sure you go to several forums to get the most information.|`|iq67KsNXaa	Well I do not know the actual percent chance that your child can have autism but the chances will and /or can increase by the following: <br>  <br>  Having a child at the age of 40 or later<br>  Drinking alcohol before and/or while pregnant<br>  doing drugs and smoking while pregnant<br>  <br>  I'd guess that the chances of having a normal child would be different if an autistic child had a child, but I am not sure about that.

DFJ9m4WKaa	I think I lasted about 5 minutes, definitely not more than 10 the first time. But the second time, we spent more time fooling around and I think between the sex and foreplay we probably went on several times for about an hour. I was 14 at the time, so my figures are not exact.    But now that I'm a little older and wiser I've come to realize that when a guy orgasms he doesn't have to stop having sex.

I cut out all fast food and soda and eat lots of protein and vegetables the first 2 weeks were the hardest but once i started to see the scale go down it was motivating and made me want to stick to the diet and not miss a work out. i also wrote down everything i ate and made sure i stuck to my 1200 calories because i started during the Holidays (worst time) i did cheat a little but got back on track once they were over with.  good luck:)

AA12133859	Starving yourself actually keeps weight on you as your bodies.  We have a starvation trigger where your body starts to conserve all the calories it can to keep us alive.  And since most of us starve ourselves out of choice, since we can get food, it doesn't work, the hunger eventually overtakes you and you go crazy eating all you can.    That said, there are no quick fixes.  Formula to lose weight, eat less than you use.   And targeted weight loss does not work.  My experience as a woman, it comes off the upper body first, the lower body last.      Do cardio 3 to 5 times a week for AT LEAST 30 minutes. Also strength training.   This way as the fat falls off, sleek toned muscles are revealed.      Accept your body type!  You inherited your body type (this is one thing you can blame your parents for.  Even at my goal weight, I will have hips, azz and thighs.     Think of it as a lifestyle change not a diet or you work out until you look like you want.  If you do that, you will not keep looking like you want.    Finally,, always see a doctor before you start a diet or exercise program.

Kh5o3QCcaa	I always used Pilate's.  You need to target you core muscle group and if you google that it should turn up some great exercises.      My favorite for tightening or 'flattening' my lower tummy is v ups.  Lay flat on the floor and simultaneously pull your legs and upper body up (forming a 'V' shape with your body) When your fingers and toes touch slowly go back down.  The key to this is steady control.    Good luck!|`|cd37yLuZaa	if you have ondemand, go to excersize tv and do some ab workouts|`|c3ajlD7haa	Unfortunately, there is no such a thing as "spot reducing", no matter what they try to sell you on tv.  And the stomach is the toughest place.  Just do lots of cardio and eat healthy - carbs, healthy fats, and protein!  Alcohol makes fat go to your tummy and thighs.
oN9vSZlhaa	At your age this memory loss can't be anything seriousness. It is just the way you're wired. Your brain may struggle to encode auditory (hearing) information. I would suggest trying different ways to remember things, post it notes, a calender, or day planner. The mind's capacity to store short term memory varies from person to person and is in no way an indicator of intelligence or anything wrong. You just need to find what ways of remembering works best for you.|`|NT835TfFaa	I forget too.  Mostly I'm just preoccupied.  lots of people do that.  You could be stressed, worried, or just have other things on your mind.  Or you could just not remember.

YQ9YXcEkaa	The best thing to do is talk to a lawyer who knows the ins and outs of disability and/or employment law.  However, from just a cursory reading of the Code of Federal Regulations, substance absue may qualify as a "serious condition" under FMLA; however, your brother likely needs to be under the care of a physician to qualify.  Specifically, the CFR states:    "Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, absence because of the employee's use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave."    You can read this entire section of the CFR online at the Department of Labor's website:    http://www.dol.gov/dol/allcfr/ESA/Title_...
xbluKawHaa	This is because your body is starting to work harder and harder to maintain the same amount of work everyday.  But because of the increase of exercise, your body doesn't have enough fuel to completely keep working and the food you are putting into it, just isn't enough anymore.  Your body needs more food in order to keep up the harder exertion nowadays.  Thus the thirst for more food and water.  This is perfectly normal.  Do not worry on the fact that you could eat too much, adding slightly more food into your diet is fine.  Also, sometimes when you work extremely hard, [actually all the time] you sweat out electrolytes, but drinks like powerade and gatorade can replenish that sensation because electrolytes can cause the need for water, rehydration or sometimes fatigue.  So just eat more and drink gatorade or powerade and you'll be fine.|`|SURQDHGcaa	People who exercise a lot need to eat more. For example, a sedentary 13 year old should be consuming about 2000 calories, while a very active 13 year old should be consuming at least 2500 calories and drinking lots of water. So, yes, it's normal to feel hungry and thirsty because when you exercise you body uses up the food and water you have consumed. If you're really worried about it, you can talk to your doctor.|`|3yB5TfL7aa	See a doc|`|EP34SN5baa	you should face the fact that you MAY be pregnat|`|F2QtzNyXaa	maybe prego, or your body is getting use to your routine of exercise, and probably your metabolism is going up.|`|Yw2Ynm0Daa	nope it just means you need eat and drink more|`|JBLMKjm1aa	eating chicken and rice all the time doesnt sound so yummy.  try eating more varieties to get all the proteins, calcium, and vitamins your body needs.  and some sugar!  :DD  i swim for two and a half hours everyday, 6 days a week.   and im fine.|`|Jxq4TIavaa	maybe, the foods in your eating that has msg Mono sodium glutamate, usually makes you hyper or feel like drinking gallons of water. its mostly in Pizza, chips, or american food that has msg.

UuLJfXjgaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different trials and seeing the results.I would check out the site at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.|`|nWgTur4qaa	You are better off eating foods that flash fat away.     Activity  Calories Burned per Hour  Bicycling, 6 mph 240  Bicycling, 12 mph 410  Cross-country skiing 700  Jogging, 5? mph 740  Jogging, 7 mph 920  Jumping rope 50  Running in place 650  Running, 10 mph 1280  Swimming, 25 yds./min. 275  Swimming, 50 yds./min. 500  Tennis, singles 400  Walking, 2 mph 240  Walking, 3 mph 320  Walking, 4? mph 440      Here is a list of foods that will wake up your metabolism and help you flush fat out of your system.    Citrus Fruits    Citrus fruits like, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons, and limes contain high concentrations of Vitamin C (this is also called ascorbic acid). This Vitamin C has a fat burning quality.    Vitamin C reduces the effectiveness of fat. It reduces its content and can liquefy or dilute fat. By diluting the fat, it makes it less effective, and easier to flush out of your system. Vitamin C also works on cholesterol deposits. Vitamin C can help burn out the cholesterol, hence, making it difficult for cholesterol deposits to form in blood vessels.    By adding Citrus Fruits to your daily diet, try every meal and also a snack, you will great increase your metabolism, increase your ability to get rid of fat, and also help you to control your cholesterol levels.    Soybeans    Soybeans contain lecithin, this chemical will shield your cells from accumulating fat. This chemical prevents, like a shield, fat from forming on your cells. It will also break down fatty deposits in your body.    Eat soybeans at least 3 times a week and you'll be boosting your bodies ability to get rid of fat. You can find soybeans in most health food stores.    Apples, Berries, Fresh Fruit    Apples contain a chemical call pectin. This chemical is found in most berries, and fresh fruit. The pectin is in the cell walls of most fruits, especially apples.    Pectin limits the amount of fat your cells can absorb. This will put a natural limitation on the amount of fat your cells can absorb. Pectin, once in your system, has a water binding property, it absorbs watery substances, and these watery substances in turn bombards the cells and makes it release fat deposits.    Add applesauce (it's loaded with pectin), apples, fresh fruit and berries, to your diet and let the power of pectin pulverize the fat that accumulates on your cells. An apple a day can help keep the fat away.    Garlic Oil    Garlic oil or the juice of garlic has a significant protective quality to cells which help to reduce fatty deposits. When taken, it brings down the levels of fat. Garlic, garlic oil, or anything with garlic, also has an antibiotic property to it and can be used to cure many ailments. Please look at a home remedies page I wrote and you'll see all the uses garlic has to offer, but in brief, it can be used as an antibiotic, it also destroys bacterial infections, and has the power to reduce fat in your cells dramatically.     Diuretic    What is a Diuretic? A diuretic is a medication or chemical that promotes the elimination of fluid in the body. This can lead to an accelerated metabolism that seems to flush out the fatty deposits that may lodge themselves on cells. Diuretics break down fatty deposits into small chunks and makes it easier for your body to flush these nasty little things out of your body.    Asparagus    Asparagus contains the chemical asparagine. This is an alkaloid that stimulates the kidneys and improve the circulatory process. These alkaloids directly effect the cells and break down fat. It also contains a chemical that helps to remove waste from the body by breaking up the oxalic acid, this acid tends to glue fat to cells, so by breaking the acid up, it helps to reduce fat levels.    Beets    Beets are a strong diuretic that focuses on the liver and kidneys. Beets flush out floating body fats. They have a special iron the cleanses the corpuscles, corpuscles are blood cells that can contain fat deposits.    It also contains a chlorine that also helps to flush out fatty deposits. This chlorine stimulates the lymph which will clear out the fat deposits.    Brussel Spouts    This vegetable stimulates the glands, the pancreas especially, which releases hormones the has a cleansing effect on the cells. There are also minerals the stimulate the kidneys. Waste is released quicker and it helps to clean out the cells.    Cabbage    This cleanses your body of waste matter because it contains sulphur and iodine, which helps to cleanse the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. Cabbage is a great food if you should have a pot belly or a middle age spread. The diuretic cabbage will help to break up the fat in this area.    Carrots    Carrots contains carotene, a form of Vitamin A, this carotene will start a fat flushing reaction in your system. This reaction will literally wash out fat and waste quickly. The carotene will be transformed into vitamin A in the intestines and this process will create a speed up in your metabolism|`|EertNe9Taa	does advertisement work?|`|qPwKSysbaa	Hydroxycut is the only weight loss product I can vouch for http://www.herbsack.com/product/overview...
6NZeItMAaa	You could try herbal remedies, aromatherapy, running, yoga and meditation.    I think the best is Yoga and Meditation    These are Eastern arts just like aromatherapy and, like aromatherapy, have been around for thousands of years. People in the West tend to want to hurry everything along, which can be one reason why we are so much more stressed than people in the East. Yoga involves a series of stretching exercises that are designed to allow you to concentrate on something other than yourself. Meditation is the process of clearing your mind of negative thoughts and concentrating on nothing. Both are equally effective at calming you down if you understand how to use these techniques towards alleviating stress.    Yoga and meditation work pretty much the same way as exercising, cleaning and counting do to relieve stress - they draw your attention away from the stressful situation and to something else. This is the secret to controlling your stress - to focus your attention on something that is either positive or neutral. Once you have learned how to use these different techniques to alleviate stress, you can then work on controlling how you react to stress.

6UATnt3laa	I am just like you.  First of all, remember that there are other people out there just like you.  There's probably some girl feeling the same anxiety and excitement you are right now.  Just remember to relax, and breathe deep.  Tell yourself it doesn't matter, and remind yourself that even if you say something "stupid" no one is going to remember or probably even care.  Besides, if you do leave feeling embarassed, so what?  You don't have to go back if you don't want to.  Try and sit or stand with someone who's kind of off to the side, and you'll probably find you have a lot in common.  If not, find a group of people and make conversation by asking about or complimenting the club.  Some people might judge, but there's always going to people that are looking to make more friends just like you.  I was really nervous about going bowling with people I didn't know.  I ended up having such a great time because I realized that those people weren't out to judge me, so dont be hard on yourself.|`|DkVofG9paa	make sure you smile, it shows that you are a friendly person and people are more apt to talk to you then to stay away from you.  deep breath and think to yourself that it's going to be ok.  compliment someone on something you like of theirs... that is a friendly gesture and may start up a conversation. good luck!|`|EjdOItfEaa	Before hand take in some deep breaths, if you work yourself up, then you will be nervous, so first off calm down.

fk9AvB25aa	One of the scary things about herpes is you can have a mild out break and not have all of the symptoms of a classic out break so it can be mistaken for some thing else. Herpes is different for every one, so not every one gets the same symptoms.  The normal time for herpes to show symptoms is between 2-14 days but it can take longer then that because your body can suppress it for months or years after you contracted it.  It's rare to have herpes away from the wet places of your body (ie nose, mouth, genitals, eyes) but that doesn't mean it can't happen. Herpes can also break out on the inner thighs, anus and buttocks.   If you want to know for sure then get the pimples tested for herpes by your doctor.|`|HKHCuRI8aa	could be a rash a used to get bad rashjes abovemy junk up to my belly button and inner thhigh around my nuts on my leg never on junk or sack, but it itched and got hot and had a  edge where it stopped.??|`|wQJtKx6zaa	You don't have to have a fever, headache, or any sign of discomfort. The pimples can appear anywhere on your body ( like on the back of your leg), and not just in the genital area. I took a course in college that included topics on STD's  when I considered going pre-med, and I remember the symptoms exactly, as a friend of mine ended up contracting it, and I was there to help her. However, stop asking us questions and get to a doctor asap. If you do have it, remember that you will have a responsibility to tell any of your future sex partners that you have it even if you do wear a condom. By not telling them, you are continuing the cycle. Plus, there is no cure, but it is not a curse. My friend is just fine, as she married and had 2 children naturally with no issues.
QSZ6oMVCaa	Greetings,     I have been taking 5-HTP for several months now and it has truly been a veritable miracle cure for me personally.  It has greatly alleviated my depression and anxiety problems and caused my obsessional thought patterns to disappear completely.    5-HTP is a natural amino acid derived from the African plant Griffonia. Your body uses it to manufacture serotonin and is thus very effective for people whose depression is caused by a serotonin imbalance (the most common form of depression.)  The best part is your body starts converting it within 15 minutes of your taking it, so you can actually experience immediate relief!  Studies have proven it to be more effective then Prozac and many other prominent pharmaceuticals, and it has a success rate of 80 percent, typically with no side effects.  Patients report increasing levels of well-being the longer they are on it.  With a proper serotonin-positive diet, exercise, nutritional supplements, and amino acids, there is the possibility that you can go off the 5-HTP and still maintain its positive effects longterm.       It cannot however be taken for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis, and can worsen your problems if you have any of these disorders. It also cannot be taken with MAO inhibitors.  Studies have shown it to be effective in boosting serotonin production when taken in conjunction with Prozac, but patients are generally told to be cautious when mixing this supplement with pharmaceuticals.  Fish oil can boost dopamine production by up to 40% and is a wonderful supplement to take along with 5-HTP.    The only side effect I encountered early on was a bad skin rash and dark undereye circles, both treated successfully with Benadryl allergy.  I stopped taking it for a few weeks and started it again with no problems.      I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the book The Mood Cure by Julia Ross.  It is a such a wellspring of valuable information that I couldn't type it all here if I tried-which I did! Ha Ha! :)    Good luck to you two!|`|duVTqRM4aa	Fish oil is fine with lexipro, but I'd hold off on the 5-HTP.  Many of the supplements out there with this aren't very good and 5-HTP can turn to quinolinic acid in your system which is not good.  It can cause more pain in fact.   I don't trust synthetic supplements of any kind either, so I avoid the stuff and use noni to get my seratonin levels up and relax me.  Coming off of lexipro you'd be better off with some adaptogenic herbs like holy basil or rhodiola (new chapter has a good product with this).  Good luck.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|DFXyD8riaa	Run RUN RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bVsRXAapaa	its a lost cause|`|vLVbVtDSaa	Squats, squats and more squats.  If you want to to work the inner thigh especially, do plie squats.  Essentially, it's a normal squat with your feet turned out, forming sort of a V-shape on the ground.  Doing 3 sets of 15 reps or doing them for a full minute everyday will make a huge difference.    And don't forget - don't let your knees go past your toes!

NDOvByeXaa	you are on your way to becoming severely obese.      you need to have your parent take you to a nutritionist, have your diet re-evaluated.    From there you need to start exercising.

cmCt2udnaa	First I would like to say that you need more protein if you expect to lose weight honey. Your body needs to protein to burn fat. Protein is essential in weight loss. Experts say that you should start your First meal of the day off with some sort of protein substance, preferably eggs. I am not sure how the ACV thing works but I have never herd from anyone of it being very effective. If you are 14 you don't need to lose weight. I bet you are tall too, huh? Honey, life is too short. Enjoy the time you have, Don't restrict. That is a dangerous path to walk. You are barely eating anything. You fat rations are good but you have just carbs and little protein. You can't grow or live that way. Enjoy what you can. You live once, and there is no chocolate in hell, it melts!     Good luck to you dear!!|`|nX9eoEZ8aa	that's bad to you. You won't be eating nearly enough. You need about fifteen hundred calories a day to be healthy. The running will be good for you. I really doubt the acv does anyhing. How tall are you?

IKakoOfyaa	Pink eye is contagious.  You can get it from another person or if you have a cold or other infection, cough or sneeze on your hands and rub your eyes, you can get it that way.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have the symptoms of pink eye, but the only way to know for sure is to see your doctor.

ydDEKTyoaa	I go to a dermatologist and I took antibiotics for four months and got three additional prescriptions but before I went to the dermatologist I tried all the tricks of the trade. The one I personally found the most effective was crushing an aspirin or ibuprofen tablet and making a paste out of it with a couple drops of lemon juice. Put it on overnight, wash it off in the morning, and make sure you put on a good moisturizer as it's very drying, and your skin will be better. Of course it's not a miracle, you'll still have acne but it helps with the redness and dramatically reduces the size. If you do it a few nights in a row, or every other night, it'll help a LOT. But like I said, it's really drying. So invest in a good oil-free moisturizer.    Another thing - don't wash your face with a bar of soap. It's really bad for your skin according to my derm. You should try out Cetaphil or SFC (you can get SFC over the counter without a prescription) Also try avoiding dairy when possible, because hormones in dairy products contribute to acne.|`|xM3iQwhaaa	cetaphil works really good and its gentle    you can find it at wal mart target, cvs and walgreens i'm sure|`|v6yMBpB0aa	i found that neutrogena post acne mark fading peel works amazing. it clears up acne fast and also reduces the redness of it and it never over dries my skin which is amazing because i have really dry skin. just wash your face once a day and make sure youre makeup is oil free or noncomegdonic. also avoid touching your face as much as possible and make sure your hair stays away from your skin.
rcZWsfHdaa	That doesn't sound at all to be asthma to me. Ashtma is usually severe chest pains and wheezing when exercising or getting some other kind of allergen (including dust) triggering you.    When asthma is 'triggered' by an allergen, tubes connected to your lungs get inflamed...so you cannot breathe air out of your lugs but can get air in: making them get full and expanded. This hurts like hell! lol|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I'm sorry my friend but that sounds perfectly normal to me. Except the part about exhaling through your nose. But I still don't see that it needs "treatment".|`|7y0eanLlaa	you could try a nasal strip on the nose to open the nasal airways,but when running or doing any exercise best to breath in through your nose and out of mouth or take a breath in through your mouth and slowly blow to exhale..no it dos`nt sound like asthma or you would be tight chested and wheezing.

PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.

I didn't have too many issues - just a small overbite and some crooked teeth - I got mine in year 6 and had them off within two years. I never had to wear a retainer afterwards (which was thanks to the way that my orthadontist did them) - some people do for a year or so, others only need to wear them at night...     Best bet, see an orthadontist or get a referral from your dentist and undergo a consultation - they will have the right answers to suit you.|`|bRexdYL4aa	it depends on how bad they are and how your dentist does them. mine said mine are really crooked and might have to have them For several years|`|e9dCXeuNaa	Depends on you  Like my mouth was bad  My orthodontist said I need 3 yrs min.  That was a year and a half ago and now he's telling me  I should get them off in about 5 months  :D

AA10672349	There is some good info at this site|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|DQMMCmY6aa	maybe its your guy!! maybe hes just not the one for you!! or maybe theres something wrong with your hormones!|`|BPwpQV6faa	find someone you're more attracted to|`|zx8cVDqIaa	That lotion or cream thingy, It sells at Pharmacy's all around the US.

So i wouldn't buy into that.     There ARE a few things you can do, so don't worry. here are some suggestions that have worked for me & others:    - are you on birth control? knowing that your risk of getting pregnant is very low usually makes you feel more empowered & in control more. So if you're not on bc or dont use condoms, etc I'd recommend it.     - try to spice things up. Grab a magazine like cosmopolitan that is packed with tips to help get it on.    - last but not least, this may sound a bit cheesy but can work wonders; try to really get in tune with your body, feel every touch & really concentrate on it. You will be more aware of your senses & have heightened arousel.     Best of luck. :]|`|nyL2uNVEaa	I agree with finding someone you're more attracted to.    But it also depends on how many partners you've had...    Don't tie yourself down, it you're not feeling it-you're just not feeling it. Don't lose hope, your sex drive is there, trust me. I felt the same exact way! You just have to find the right guy to bring it out of you.       (I'm 21 now, I was with my first boyfriend for 4 years and lost interest in sex after 3 years. We broke up and I am so attracted to my current bf and sex is so amazing, better than i have ever had or even knew i could have.)
ciz0qYwnaa	If you drink 4 cups of green tea a day, you will lose approx. 80 calories. <br>  <br>  You are not obese but overweight, and it's normal at your age because you are growing (and to top it you had anemia).<br>  <br>  But there is nothing wrong with wanting to be fit and healthy. You HAVE to exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes a day - more is better. I exercise for more than two hours a day because I'm into dancing (intensive ballet) and sports a lot. Take up a sport or two that you really like - dancing, soccer, basketball, swimming, anything that will make you feel good and help you lose weight! <br>  <br>  If you can't get into a team, just practice a few exercises at home. Push-ups, sit-ups, weights, etc. <br>  <br>  By the way, losing 10 pounds a week isn't a very good idea. Ideally you need to lose 2lbs a week for the weight to stay off. If there are 4 weeks in a month, then 4 x 2 = 8 lbs. If you lose more it usually doesn't stay off for long. <br>  <br>  DON'T use laxatives, it will seriously f*ck up your body - I used laxatives and diuretics (I'm recovering from eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia) now) and sometimes now going to the bathroom is painful for me. It won't really help you lose weight because it's just waste your body was already planning on throwing out... Your body has already sucked all the nutrients and calories it needed so it's useless.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|OOzkkgFmaa	Well we would prolly have to see a picture to determine if your OBESE. cuz everyone is different on how their weight evens out, if you know what im sayin.<br>  I weigh about 155 but im 5'6ish and im 17. plus im kind of muscular. not in a gross way. but i do have some "love handles" if you know what im sayin. they arent to bad. but i am working on losing them.<br>  <br>  the way i am dieting is i got an eliptical glider machine. i tried the sit ups n stuff but i could never get my self to keep it up for more than a week. with my machine, its reallly funnn! and it keeps track of the calories i lose. so it gives me a goal. i lose 500 a day which will cause me to lose 1 pound a week. i know that isnt much but trust me thats hard enough as it is. <br>  <br>  but i totally recommend getting a glider. i know they are expensive. but your health is priceless!
xN6ewXe0aa	there are these tampons that fold up into a smaller size where you can stick it in your pocket and go to lunch and hit the bathroom during and no one would know. and hey. if someone found out you have a tampon. who cares? guys know that all women get periods and likewise with girls. they need to grow up and stop making fun of it because ALL women get it and there aint no way outta it! ahah hope i helped!|`|hSCrHg3Vaa	put them in your purse.... only take them out when your sitting on the toilet.. that way no one can know... lol

AA10579309	You should see a doctor -- getting short of breath may be a sign that you have heart problems, especially if your cholesterol is high.  Do you get short of breath when lying down flat?  Do you have coughing or shortness of breath at night?  Any swelling in your legs?
5TM9P8tsaa	*My mother in law tought this at her studio. You need to stuff the inside of the toe shoes with cotton batting you buy in the sewing section. Most of the students place a little in the end of the shoe, and take the rest to their toes. Try the combination at home before class to get the forum suited to yourself. It just takes time to tuffing up the toes. You end up with some calasus.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	i think it is the arch to - might want to read up on it or ask someone who has taken ballet.    it requires lots of mucle control in the legs/feet.    i guess i would start by standing on the balls of my feet and walk around like that to get my body and posture together as balance would be required.|`|AA10450066	To start with you would need something to help you balance yourself with (if you don't have  anything you can use the back of a chair) you want something about waist high, Then start to build up your metatarsals  by holding on to the chair and stretching the muscles up and down, so your basically on the bottom of the toe going into the foot.After that go slowly up on the tip of the toes holding on to the back of the chair making sure you have good posture. Keep slowly working up until you can do it without the chair,but always make sure you stretch out before and cool down afterwords or you could end up with some nasty cramps or possibly a broken toe. Good luck and take your time.
rYsLoFTJaa	Best toning exercise for arms: chinups, pullups, and pushups with a clap.  They have instructional videos for these on youtube.  Best for legs: jumping squats, lots of front kicks (again, videos on youtube), and ballet plies.  For the stomach...when standing, lean back as far as you can without bending your legs, put your hands behind your head, and use JUST your abs to pull yourself back up.  Do this until you can't anymore.  For the lower abs, look up "lower ab crunch" on youtube.  Yes I love youtube. Lol|`|dlgQCSocaa	To tone your arms you simply need to strength train your arms.  You can do body weight exercises, exercises with weight machines/cable machines/dumbbells/etc., or try a sculpting class.  To tone your arms you need to focus on both your biceps and triceps to balance things out. Bicep curls, Triceps extension, Triceps Press, Dips, Assisted Chin Ups, etc.  If you need some help, visit your local gym.  Most gyms give a free consultation when you join, and at this time you could ask the trainer for some hints for toning your arms; or hire a trainer for a session to set you up on a program.  Its worth it if you are unsure of what to do.  Good luck :)
Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Brian,    Bactrim/co-trimoxazole/septrin (All the same drug) isn't actually an antibiotic it is a sulphonamide which is similar but different.    There are many alternatives which you could be put onto but you have to make a decision.    Either go back to your GP and get them switched, or continue taking them until the course is finished. just because you feel better it doesn't mean that you are and if you stop taking them mid course you will get the condition straight back again.    Nausea is a very common side effect and rash is another common one with this drug.    You could try taking it with or after food which may or may not help.    My personal advice would be to go back and get them changed darling, it is pointless swapping one discomfort for another.    Good luck,    Love Mel.X|`|AA11388527	Of course there are other antibiotics.  What you're feeling is a common adverse reaction to antibiotics.  Try taking the Bactrim with food.  If this doesn't help, report this to your prescriber and you'll be switched.  Call it either Bactrim or co-trimoxazole.
9e42bab2f8e7deadb0c82f0996373877aa	You can't prevent it, it just happens. Yes, you can get it in your sleep, but trust me the pain will wake you up. It is horribly painful, not trying to scare you. I didn't actually have appendicitis, a cyst burst and caused it to become infected, but overall it's the same thing. None the less, you'll know if you have it and should go to the emergency room if you think you do. Also, I doubt you'll get it, it's not very common at all. Or at least, no one I know has had it. Yes you can get it removed if you don't have appendicitis, but surgery HURTS.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I had it, I think it just happens randomly.  The pain was pretty terrible, but they thought I had food poisoning, so I should have gotten in there sooner for surgery than I actually did.    If you get it, you'll start throwing up and feeling really achy and your lower abdominal muscles will start hurting.  If you go to the doctors or hospital, they'll be able to push on your side where your appendix is and if it's swollen or infected, it will hurt a LOT.  They'll do a scan of your belly and be able to tell if you've got it and put you into surgery.  I don't think you can prevent it at all, because I had it when I was 15 and ate healthy and was involved with sports and exercise, but I'm not positive...    The best thing to do would be to not worry about it and if you start getting pains on your lower right side along with throwing up, go get it checked out.|`|oAYCestzaa	ive never had it but i heard the pain is incredibly terrible!!|`|Op37pHd3aa	if you have appendicitis you'll know. the pain is unbearable. There really is no way to predict when and who will get it. Even the causes of appendicitis is unclear. Avoiding foods that might irritate the digestive tract might help.|`|1XRS9jzpaa	It's not a generic disease...anyone can get it.  You can get it in your sleep but you'd wake up.  Depends. I had appendicitis and i didnt have that much pain at all or a fever i actaully went out that night. I only went to the hospital because it was going on for like 3 days, but thank god i did. they said it was the size of a hot dog and wrapped around colon. But i am fine now!  I dont know if you can get it out without it being an emergency would prob. be really expensive and it doesnt matter what you eat. Your appendix does nothing. Dont worry hun. If you think about it to much your gunna make yourself sick. its really not that big of a deal. its pulling teeth to the doctors yeah know..simple.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	appendicitis isn't something that comes randomly and it's not genetic. it is caused by   `feces, parasites, or growths that clog the appendiceal lumen   `enlarged lymph tissue in the wall of the appendix, caused by infection in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere in the body   `inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis   `trauma to the abdomen   it is a very sharp pain and swelling. it gets worse as the swelling increases. but you are being paranoid the chances of you getting it are not that big. it just happens. and they will not remove your appendix if you don't have appendicits.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	You can get appendicitis at any time, but most people don't. There's nothing you can eat to prevent it. You can probably have it removed without having appendicitis, but that might be a bit obsessive-compulsive.|`|fSwpE4ziaa	its kind of a random thing, my mom had it from brushing her teeth, one toothbrush bristle came off and got stuck in her appendix|`|BzQp8qUXaa	i dont have an appendix... my parents had it removed at birth because of that... it does nothing so ya go ahead get it removed. the pain is aweful but really pain is only temperary|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	you have an abnormal fear of this, my suggestion is to seek a therapist to work this out.

It is thought that appendicitis begins when the opening from the appendix into the cecum becomes blocked. The blockage may be due to a build-up of thick mucus within the appendix or to stool that enters the appendix from the cecum. The mucus or stool hardens, becomes rock-like, and blocks the opening. This rock is called a fecalith (literally, a rock of stool). At other times, the lymphatic tissue in the appendix may swell and block the appendix. After the blockage occurs, bacteria which normally are found within the appendix begin to invade (infect) the wall of the appendix. The body responds to the invasion by mounting an attack on the bacteria, an attack called inflammation. An alternative theory for the cause of appendicitis is an initial rupture of the appendix followed by spread of bacteria outside the appendix.. The cause of such a rupture is unclear, but it may relate to changes that occur in the lymphatic tissue, for example, inflammation, that line the wall of the appendix.)|`|US0l3MZWaa	Iit is very painful, dont eat sea food or red meat, forever|`|Ca29B3eiaa	I know how you feel. I once had sharp pain in my left abdomen and everyone told me it was appendicitis I WAS TERRIFIED. turned out it wasn't anything serious. but my cousin had it and he says it hurts like hell! but you feel a little nausea before.     I don't know if eating prevents it, but right before my cousin got a appendicitis he was at a friend's birthday party and ate A LOT, i don't know if that has anything with getting appendicitis though.     HOPE THAT HELPS :)|`|rS5oHNGjaa	Can I ask what appendictis is?|`|qnU0XXlIaa	Yes, you could get it in your sleep, but the pain would certainly wake you up - there's no way you could sleep through it.  You would have plenty of time to wake up and go to the emergency room.    No, there's nothing you can do to prevent it.    The pain is very, very sharp and intense.  It's usually in your lower right abdomen.  You will feel very tender there.  Trust me, you'll know if it's appendicitis.    Yes, you can get your appendix removed, but I'm not sure how many surgeons would just do it for no reason.  My mom had hers removed without appendicitis, but she did it in the same surgery with her C-section.    The bottom-line is, stop worrying.  You'll probably never get it, but if you do you'll know it right away, and you definitely won't die or anything.|`|IZfi37oaaa	First off appendicitis is not genetic...    u can get appendicitis at any time even while u sleep  if u eat and live a healthy lifestyle u are less likely to get it   the pain varies with the case (depending if the appendix has rupture or not before u receive medical treatment)  and technically yes u can get it removed before u get appendicitis but MOST or ALL doctors would advise u not to do so... there really isn't really a reason to have it taken out.    btw - not everyone will get appendicitis.... in my family alone of seven people only one had appendicitis.    and don't worry about it ok... if u do get it just remember to breath.. doctors know what they are doing and they will give u the medicine to make u feel better and take any of ur pain/ discomfort away..    please dont be so terrified.. there are worse things trust me

6NZeItMAaa	Negative reactions to stress include:    Drinking, drug use, being unable to get out of bed, having a panic attack, abusing a family member or even an animal, abusing prescription drugs, promiscuous sex, and compulsive behaviours such as gambling or over spending.    Try to have positive reactions to stress     Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.    You can choose to react to stress in a negative way or in a positive way, it is all up to you. This is the only choice that you have when it comes to most stress.     Think about a stressful situation that you have in your life at the moment. If you are like most people, you will not have to think for long as most of us have some sort of stress in our lives. Think carefully about the stress. Write it on a piece of paper.    Is this stress something that you can control? Is it something that you can do without? If the stress is something that you can eliminate from your life, why are you not ridding yourself of this stress?    If the stress is something that you cannot control, how are you reacting to the stress? Are your reactions negative or positive?    By choosing to react to your stress in a positive manner, you can not only control your stress, but you will end up eliminating the stress.|`|xZwwb3kVaa	Everyone at some time of their life will go through this form of depression, whether it be loss of job, losing a loved one and many other reasons, plus being lonely.The only thing to do is to find something which takes your mind off it as you tend to sit and brood over the little things which really have no purpose at all. This in turn builds up into a very big problem and then you sit and brood some more.It sounds as though you need to get out, so try doing something different like going to Night Classes to learn something like I did and it lifts your moral up like you never know.I found it very interesting to learn things that I never knew and made a lot of friends in doing so.|`|B24W8w43aa	Exercise and proper diet is the only way forward.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively).     The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.    Practice one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.    Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past. Because many people can't access/afford professional therapy, I include the EFT, and EMDR variant for them to try, free of charge (professional is best). Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy is generally available in most areas, but EMDR (see section 33) may well be worth trying, and is becoming more widespread. A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective.|`|6sAbs2iiaa	Hi, I  had panick attack and I felt like I was gonna die my hearth was pumping so fast as if I was gonna get a hearth attack but did not, I use to feel like I have a ball in my throth but did not , I use to freeze be always cold but it's all part of panic attacks and it comes from long term accumulated stress in your life.

DFJ9m4WKaa	I think you're full of it. The largest penis girth measured only 6.25 inches around. If you seriously have a penis that is 8 inches around, which is gigantic, you should put that thing on display! Be a porn star or make some money off that that thing.    http://www.blurofinsanity.com/penislengt...    On the off chance you are serious, maybe you just mismeasured it, here's my answer - any expert will tell you that to a man his penis often looks smaller to him than to other people. Most men learn how to cope with this. Some develop an inferiority complex over it and become real jerks who try to over compensate by buying the biggest of everything.    So maybe look at it like this: The average size of the human penis, erect, is just under six inches. 90% of men range between 5-7 inches. Less than 5% of men are over 7 inches and less than 1% is larger than 8. So you may be 6' 5" tall and you may think your wang looks small, but you are in reality at the top 99 percentile of penis sizes.    Be happy with what you got.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You are NOT quite small!  Mine looks larger when I wear bifocals!|`|AA12284392	Try trimming your pubic hair.

WkcPWmR9aa	depends how low it is but it is called neutropenia (low neutrophil count).   Since it is the "soldier of our body", you may be a high risk for infections.  try read this to see more normal blood chemistry counts  http://www.promdinurses.com/2008/10/norm...|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	ANC is your absolute neutrophil count:    ANC is the real or actual number of white blood cells that a patient has to fight an infection. White blood cells are the part of the patients blood that work against possible bacteria, fungus, or viruses that may make the patient sick. A normal ANC is greater than 2,500. A safe ANC is greater than 1,000. After chemotherapy, BMT,  and radiation, a patient's ANC may drop low as 0. When the ANC drops below 500 , it is important that patient's remain away from crowds and people who have colds, flu, or runny noses. If a patients is in the hospital with ANC below 500, he will be placed in protective isolation. This is to protect the patient from being exposed to possible infections.     hope this helps..

Eat fruits & veggies of course. It's typical to eat a small breakfast and a big dinner, but my health teacher said you actually want to do the opposite. And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help!

Mental disorders are sometimes difficult because some medications work for others but may not work for you. It is a matter of persistence in finding the right medication or combination for you. There is always help and hope.  Family, friends and associates never think that's okay the suffering is over. They are devastated for life. Senseless when there is help.

Wait until you are old enough to handle any bad consequences that sometimes result from sex.    Anything over 5 inches is a good size. Anyway, quit comparing yourself to others.

Better throw it back".|`|N8AJnAbuaa	wow ur dick is punny if i were u i would take sum viagra and stretch it to make it longer like me 13inchs|`|BAlYRNN8aa	Your penis size is fine, you will have nothing to be embarressed about!|`|K2a3XFlFaa	i think thats a pretty average length. plus your only 15 so you still have time|`|Xd1acIA0aa	you poor poor young man.

Do yourself a favor.|`|0JERmAslaa	ur fine dude|`|9ZxQ685Iaa	thats above average.the average for 15 is a little under 5 in.|`|gA9VyfuZaa	sounds alright to me.|`|rIYb6RpCaa	Thats above average, don't be embarrased at all :D|`|RNkQ9qPQaa	6.75 inches is not small. You will be in the average catagory. Don't worry about the size of your penis, just concentrate on what you are doing and try to make it last as long as you can. Sometimes the first time for a boy is not as great as we think it will be. So be prepared to concentrate on what you are doing, ask the young lady if it feels good to her or if there is something she would like you to do. Take your time, make love to her do not just *** and go. Make it last at least thirty minutes and you will never get a complaint out of the young lady, If there is one point in your lovemaking session that you can tell from her reactions she is enjoying it to the utmost, keep it up and if she cools off a bit go back to doing what you were doing when she was really enjoying it. Just take your time, don't worry about the size of your penis, and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.|`|cqPbYWL6aa	You should be very embarrased!  You are not a man DUMBASS!|`|6ix7aBSRaa	I'm 21 and my penis is the size of a popocorn shrimp.

qjBQnZ5oaa	If you are going through an emotional pain, depending on the person, sex CAN sooth your pain because you are focused on sex and relationship with your partner. Also, sex should be pleasurable, so it would sooth most people in a lot of cases. I hope I could help.|`|mY19PPlIaa	If you would do anything then go seek professional help, that's what you need. Cutting yourself and sex may help a little but in the long run it will make your problems worse and they come with bad consequences such as death, pregnancy, aids, or STDs.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Honestly, cutting releases endorphins, which lifts your mood.  Then again, so does exercise and bananas.  Always keep busy and always stay around people to keep your mind off of pain.  I would stay away from sex, though.  It helps for awhile, but it hurts in the end.|`|e7ozlAsPaa	Please go see a counselor! Doing anything to temporarily distract you from emotional pain is only temporary and will only cause you more pain in the end. Whatever your emotional pain is believe me it is temporary and can be dealt with through counseling and time. Things will get better be strong!|`|FJpgyhW7aa	You need to see a therapist.  There's a lot of problems that come with sex that is outside of a committed relationship, like pregnancy or std's.  If you have a chemical imbalance, that can easily be fixed with a prescription.  Talk to someone, a close friend or relative maybe.     I know it sounds cliche and I'm sure you're thinking you've heard it all before, but in my experience, it really does help.  Your first time will come with its own kind of pain, don't forget.|`|UVdviQMPaa	Emotional pain is from the heart and lungs slowing down from the effect of depression hormones on the auto-brain stem. The orgasm of sex gives the hormone endorphin that cancels the depression chemical and then it is called balanced in the fluid. So if you are a player your group will help you balance your hormone needs . Cutting was stimulating a pleasure area instead of the pain area because your medulla switched the pain signal to a different channel to make endorphin. Not sure why the brain saves us by a crazy program.
Vk7kkrcLaa	definitely non HHodgkin's. hodgkins can be cured with standard treatment. Many types of non Hodgkin's are slow developing but resistant to treatment and so not easy to cure, other types of non Hodgkin's are very aggressive, if not spotted soon enough then they can kill you within months, but if caught early they can be manages well and are responsive to treatment. recurrence with non Hodgkin's is higher too. so remission doesn't tend to be very long|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	Caught early, Hodgkins has a very good prognosis (around a 98% five-year survival rate). Non-Hodgkins is not actually one specific kind of cancer but a residual category for all other lymphomas, some of which can be very aggressive and difficult to treat.
USoqyjaAaa	Total or IgM?<br>  <br>  IgM is present only during the period of acute infection.  Total core antibody will persist indefinitely.
wbZp6ZcPaa	The best thing to do in that situation is o make yourself go do it. It sounds strange but its true. The endorphins that you get from the workout will then help you stay motivated to keep going. And believe it or not-if you work out when its your time of month it'll help with cramps. <br>  <br>  Oddly in these situations it's less a matter of motivation and more a matter of will power.

6j9Lb83Caa	The physician asked you to bring shorts and a shirt because she is probablly going to check your body out everywere, shell make sure your growing the way you should be down in your vaginal area and up around your breast's. then shell probablly ask you uncompfortable questions like are you sexually active, they may take blood from you depending on if your are or not, theyll check your weight and height to make sure that you are growing the way you should be and thats about what they do at a physical now that your 14. Remember to be completly honest with your physician if you are sexually active or are starting to wonder about becoming sexually active.|`|GUuFKaaiaa	check ur blood pressure and heart beat
9pLdhuBnaa	I would recommend getting a hold of your doctor to see what they think could be going on.
bO2rzfISaa	Everyone suffers individual symptoms. You were exposed to it at the same time since you got sick at the same time. Could've been off of a door knob.
IS2FfWV3aa	sounds like you have social anxiety. You're probably afraid of someone thinking something bad about you so you just try to avoid all social interactions yourself. The best way to get out of it is to try to cope with it nice and slowly and so that you feel comfortable. Like start talking to people more, join in on a group of people's conversations, but don't try too hard. As long as you can slowly start doing that and stop caring more so what other people think about you, it will slowly get better and better. You use the reading by escaping from reality and go in to your own little universe where nothing can go wrong. Not trying to be harsh, but you just need to grow some balls and deal with it. Just try acting like your nice and friendly (smile, and laugh at jokes) soon enough it will start becoming a normal thing and even though you are faking it at first.. it will become more of a real emotion in due time. Just remember, nothing happens over night either.|`|ySk9HYhJaa	well i just think you should join a club and get to know some new people. i read ALL THE TIME!!!! and i have lots of friends and i love to speak in public. when i'm reading (which is like all the time!) my friends just come talk to me and i talk back i put my book down and hang with them or tell them to go away if i'm at a really good part....my friends accept me for who i am and and that i love to read... (sometimes i get in trouble because i read so much! oh well its worth it!) so just make an effort to talk to people and you'll make friends its really not as hard as it seems!|`|65cBvdqraa	when i see someone reading i dont really want to interupt them.  if you're always reading, and you dont talk to anyone, how do you expect someone to start a conversation with you?  you need to be more social even though you're too shy.  but if you are feeling depressed i would suggest seeing someone  even if its a school councelor.  but really, just talk to someone  if you're going to a new school, start all over again.  dont sit at the lunch table reading  because that'll make everyone think you're a nerd and nobody will want to talk to you.  just talk to at least ONE person and make a friend  thats all you really need.
gkqmrIAGaa	I'm taking you very seriously. The best overall are Tena Serenity Pads.  They have Male Guards for during the day and Overnight Pads plus Tena Underwear. They are foolproof and leakproof. I have a friend who has tried everything and found these. You need to see you doctor or pediatrician because there are medications that can stop this.  My friends problem is something entirely different. I am sorry and hope you will or have looked into this. The Tena Serenity are sold everywhere, drugstores, supermarket and discount stores like Target and Walmart.|`|fFmbBRbcaa	dude do your parents know about this it sounds like you need medication or mental help|`|1L5Uq3voaa	He. Hehe. Sorry. I did have to laugh, not going to lie. Hehehe.    Okay, that said, I happen to know what most pampers sizes are, due to my younger sis requiring the use of them.

0PpQxZ62aa	It takes -3500 calories to loose a pound, which means you need to both burn calories by working out & take less calories in by eating in order to loose weight.    Eat fruits & veggies of course. It's typical to eat a small breakfast and a big dinner, but my health teacher said you actually want to do the opposite. And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help!|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Start running! That's the best way to lose weight.     1) Don't diet excessively. You'll fail at a faster rate if you do.    2) Get a tape measure (cloth) and measure your arms, bust, waist, hips and thigh. Write it down. Repeat each month.    3) Run 12-15 minutes each night. Walk as much as you like, but RUN for 12-15 minutes.     Keep up with it! I just ran for 12 minutes each night and saw that my diet adjusted itself AND I lost around 50 inches in 3 months.|`|43A0U8l2aa	at least 30 minutes of cardio a day..so go out for a run daily    do abs workouts everyday like planks, crunches, etc    do lunges and wall sits, and sumo squats about 3-5 times a week and do three sets of 12-15    try to drink extra water, eat smaller meals more often, and stay away from junk food as much as possible|`|SLoCe1wcaa	Story of my life!    I have found that the South Beach Diet works best.  Do the Phase 1 - it takes 2 weeks and then adds good carbs back into your diet.      Walk each day - at least for an hour.  Or do something more strenuous - like running or going to the gym.   Don't take the bus to school, walk.      Check out the website and there is a good book out about South Beach.  Its way more healthy than a lot of the other diets.    People tell me I look a-mazing!  They'll say the same for you.|`|rYsLoFTJaa	Well I'm not sure how much time exactly you have, but try to cut down on refined foods, eat plenty of fruits, veggies, and lean proteins (like chicken and fish, eggs are good too).  Drink at least 6 glasses of water a day (that's 3 bottles), replace white bread with whole wheat, and allow yourself junk food for one day each week (if you cut off completely you'll crash).  Try to do cardio 3 or 4 times a week, like kickboxing, dance, or aerobic classes.  These can be bought at any video store, or even found on youtube sometimes.  Squats and lunges can be cardio exercises too, along with pushups, if you do them fast enough for a long enough period of time.  Good luck!|`|iB72Jiypaa	i joined my high school's track team and lost 15 pounds already! if you dont want to actually be part of a team, just go running. it takes about a month to get into full shape, but once you do you will be able to run as far as you want- i can run 8 miles no problem! it really helps in your weight loss, plus it tones and tightens everything. also, just try to cut down on your calorie intake, but not too too much because running really burns alot of calories. for every mile, you burn 100 calories.  good luck losing that weight!! (:|`|dlgQCSocaa	A healthy weight loss rate is 1-2lbs per week.  That means you need to be watching what you take in for calories (food) and what you expel for calories (physical activity).  If you are unfamiliar with going to a gym, I suggest you visit a local personal trainer to get you set on a program.  Even visit them a couple times to get you set up and introduced to the equipment than you can go on your own.  You need to be determined and committed.  You will need to be involved in both cardio exercise (elliptical, stepper, stair master, treadmill, bike, cardio class like spin, dance, rollar balde, etc.) as well as strength training (weights).  It is important to switch up your weight routine every 4 - 6 weeks to avoid hitting a plateau.  As far as food goes, your trainer may be able to give you a couple guidelines, or you could visit a dietian for some food ideas.  Good luck!!|`|cd37yLuZaa	if you have ondemand, excersize tv can be pretty fun
XAuor0S8aa	Absolutely not.  ...i haven't brushed my teeth for 7 months.  Their still pretty good lookin'|`|fZCfJWpOaa	YES!    Why haven't you?  It's a good way to not only get cavities, but also lose your teeth sooner and have to use dentures.|`|rLXNwqbFaa	yes for goodness sake!!!|`|eVPW1dwOaa	Ew. You need to brush two times a day, floss one time a day, and I recommend mouthwash because I can't even imagine how your breath smells (two times a day).|`|xxNAq3S1aa	yes that NASTY|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well keep going and you won't have to worry about brushing because your teeth will soon rot out of your mouth and fall out.|`|QuokZhuqaa	haha XD    yess you should, your teeth will thank you(;    I promise!!!!!!!|`|zH80yyDQaa	of course.|`|NtjWw6jlaa	yes absolutely!!!|`|aEVUEWbqaa	.
AA10173116	Susan m has great feedback. I also think she could have a small fracture. Why do you say it's not broken? Has she had an xray?|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Look  up plantar faschitis. It is an inflammation in the muscles and tendons in the foot. It is very painful, I know I had it.  If she has numbness and tingling, especially at night, look up tarsal tunnel syndrome.  I had that too.  and it is very painful at night.|`|AA10744471	Well, pain is pain. Whether it is an hairline fracture or a carpal tunnel syndrome, it is imperative that your mom has to see a doctor to correctly diagnose her condition. For all you know, she has arthritis already and needs some medication. Please tell your mom to see a doctor now.
ac4b51e4dd9a1ac339ede85a6869a7a1aa	The best thing would be to visit the doctor and find out for sure.   Then you will know how to treat it.  It should not be that strong.|`|MhpccWpmaa	for both you and besty r--go see a doctor.  hearing the symptom i'm pretty positive that you guys have Bacterial Vaginosis. it's more common than yeast infections so don't worry about that. you can clear it up easily by getting a prescription for falgyl which you take one pill twice a day for 7 days. when you have BV the odor gets worse after sex and around your period and gets worse the longer it's left untreated. this can also lead to pelvic inflammatory disease if not treated so see the dr asap!  to prevent it in the future don't wear tight pants, eat a yogurt a day with live cultures, don't wash with soap down there--use warm water or a safe soap-free feminine wash, and NEVER douche  hope this helped!|`|FNeCDm3raa	You shouldn't be able smell it just sitting there.    Sure,the vagina does not smell like roses, but it shoudn't have a noticeable odor at all.    You probably have a yeast infection coming off the periods. Maybe bacterial vaginosis. It's common, so get it checked out.|`|dF4BXtOXaa	omg i have it to   mayb its just normal and i think when i had share i was told that there were pill i think|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	you must have an infection. when you get your period it cleanses everything out of your cervix and vagina, including bacteria.  as the others said, you probably have an infection and should get checked out.  a period shouldn't smelly fishy or have a horrible odor like that.
sto6AoRtaa	wow...16... lolXD I had mine at 13, and only had one every year until i was your age and was put on the pill. The pill is birth control {used for various reasons like well, birth control, regulation[of ur period] and you can even get some that clear up acne} no, the pill does not hurt, it just will make you have a period. {which totally sucks lol} and don't freak out, a lot of girls your age are probably on the pill.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	Some people have at 10 and some 17, I am sure your in no serious danger.|`|TudZYPN5aa	No doctor should be messing with your cycle like that.     I've known people in their 20s who haven't gotten it yet.|`|l1iCPVPOaa	A family friend of ours had to get their uterus scraped to start their cycle.|`|juMKsO6laa	Refuse the pill. You don't need to rush getting your period. it is perfectly normal not to get it till you're 20 or older. Don't take the pill and mess with your natural body rhythm.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I wouldnt take the pill.. I have heard of women not starting until they are 18 or even in their 20's. I would wait it out.. If you want a doctor's opinion then I would find another doctor. Giving you a pill so that you can start your period could mess up your body and your cycles. I would seriously wait it out and see if it comes. I would of loved not having my period at age 16. I got mine at age 11. Good Luck!|`|BPwpQV6faa	consider it a blessing not to have gotten it yet|`|Z6kjwFcHaa	I have not taken the pill, but I am also fifteen and have no period.  I have a low BMI, though, and am pretty thin, so I think that's why.  You're not alone though!  It will come, I'm not looking forward to mine either!    xoxo|`|6YL7yWfxaa	Development does not end until 18, and there are people that go over that. 18 is when you should start worrying. Just stick in there.    Hope I helped,  ?Meg|`|2QrD904Gaa	As long as you are healthy, be happy you don't get your period yet.|`|TwK1QsOIaa	the only pill you're doctor would be putting you on is a birth control pill. which does not hurt at all. its like taking advil. i take it for its original purpose, birth control, but many of my friends have been put on it to control or start their periods. the hormones in it will start your period in probably 6 months. its not big deal. you'll be fine. :)
AfAmZ2dWaa	If you have not had a bowel movement in a couple of days and that is NOT normal for you, you may need to take an enema. The last thing you want to have is an impaction that can make you really sick and not to mention an embarrassing experience at the hospital to treat it. Eat foods high in fiber such as whole grains.  I hope everything comes out ok! :)|`|qbW4z3Uuaa	you could possibly have some blockage or something too if your are concerned you should go to your doctor even if you think its embarrassing.    have you felt the "need" to go number two? and then just didn't preform? or hurts if you actually "succeed"?    Have you tried taking some ex-lax? I think that if you have not even felt the need to go number 2 you should deffinatly go to your doctor asap!    EDIT:: If you are at least getting the feeling then you are probably constipated. I would try something like exlax, but becareful if you take any other meds and make sure you are okay to take it. You can also try eating some things that are high in fiber to help "loosen" you up.    Eating something like alot of cheese can be the ccause of your constipation
UOZP4Ma5aa	It is normal, tonsils can b very assymetric
Rk46lIBwaa	Its stupid rather than dangerous. Unfortunately those who 'give up smoking' but smoke even 2 or 3 cigarettes in the first 12 months have a very high relapse rate.    Like alcoholics who stop drinking, smokers who stop are still smokers who are not currently smoking. If you are serious about giving up, the maximum number of cigarettes you cn smoke is NONE!|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	Yup!  You are getting a serious 'hit' of nicotine in isolation will do little harm, but will do immense harm in the long run.    It is easily avoidable by deciding whether to smoke or not...|`|VrjF986Aaa	yeah it raises your heart rate and you could even have a heart attack, don't do it again|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Yeas, it's bad; you are risking nicotine poisoning.  Believe it or not, in high enough concentrations nicotine is a highly toxic alkaloid, so by smoking while on th patch you may raise your blood nicotine level high enough to cause organ damage.|`|AA11080047	well simply your putting two lots of nicotine in your system at the same time|`|HKNbWjtOaa	smoking is not healthy full stop, and doing it with a patch on only compounds that fact!|`|AA10227142	Nicci BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ lol|`|gl7GDLnXaa	OMG !! yes it is. My cousin almost died from that Please don't do it|`|XCHoHCrnaa	yeh, you could have a heart attack or a stoke.|`|pvabglXhaa	Smoking and the patch do not go together, it's having a double hit of nicotine.    If you do smoke with the patch on you will feel very sick, even feeling like you want to throw up.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Yes. It shows how much is habitual with smoking. You have to go through your "routine" with the cigarette. You're getting enough nicotine it's just the habit you have to break.|`|9cSDuplAaa	good job keep it up.|`|412003bff6923278c8495257104d2dcbaa	Done it.. It's really bad. Almost had to go to A&E for nicotine overdose, stayed in bed all day, feeling  dizzy.    Smoking is bad alright, but smoking with patches on is just suicidal.  Just light a fag, you'd be safer.
E6Um2jJaaa	Its a very bad habit|`|2uPEty21aa	There is no good reason to smoke but if you want to smoke, do it.    Who wants to live forever anyway?|`|SwKPJRNvaa	basically if you quit before you're 30, your lungs will repair most of the damage  if you are young and drink a lot sociably, then there's no great rush.  if not, perhaps it is time to quit!|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Gee, no answers? could be nobody can think of a reason.|`|XCHoHCrnaa	Cause when you take that first drag, youre chest will loosen and you will have that great feeling that nictine is flowing through youre body again lol x|`|7gfNIajYaa	Your doing good mate!Yes I am a smoker and the only time I would believe in advising someone in not giving up smoking is if they are under SEVERE stress and simply need it.

Remember your thinking has been working the way it does for as long as you have smoked. So it will take time to adjust and find, learn do new things. But like many say over time it gets easier.     If you want to smoke, then smoke. It's totally your choice.     What made you want to quit??|`|rcZWsfHdaa	No...sorry but smoking is very bad for you. There's one good thing about it - the buzz: but it aint worth the cancer you can get. You know them pictures yiu get on the back of ciggarrette packs ? That could be you one day.    Please quit.

plwuZ0Kuaa	Sounds to me it could be a parasite. You can get tested for parasites from your doctor.     Watch it close MRSA could develope since you cut it( the burning sensation makes me think that) Your doctor can test for it with a culture. Bactrim should take care of it.
LczX2O6aaa	This technique is fairly safe since the clamps are very very small and made for this kind of thing. It is less invasive, which is always good, and its much easier to get reversed.

When the body is getting too cold to function - or even a bit - without adequate warmth, it will start to pull heat from your extremities in order to protect the core. Next time, put thermals on, if you didn't.|`|215e8f63a273a9d5cbab203c741c8cecaa	You have a case of frost bite.  Happens to me all the time when I snowboard.  It isn't really anything to worry about though.  It'll heal soon enough.  Whatever you do don't rub or apply heat to frost bite.  Once the moisture in your skin is frozen, heat and/or friction will only worsen the injury.  You have to let yourself naturally defrost.  The pain that you felt was the warmth of your urine thawing your penis too quickly.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Bro ..please dont do this again you could end up in the hospital with hypothermia ..    It sounds to me that while the cold might have temporarily caused a problem that you already had the problem and it didnt know it ..    it sounds like you have a urinary tract infection and its just a coindence that you started noticing the symptoms now ..    i know this because after you warmed up you are still having problems off and on ..the off and on is what proves that to me ..    my advice is to drink as much purwe water and juices that you can over the next five days ..drink cranberry juice if you can and if it does not start to clear up in 5 days see a doctor right away ..  but i promise you you are going to be fine .|`|2gdWeMRfaa	i get cold when i wear converse in 65 degree california "winter", i dont blame you, your penis could have gotten cold and when you went inside the temperature difference made it tingle and feel weird|`|cqPbYWL6aa	Wear thicker socks DUMBASS|`|tYVKJTcraa	well if your pennis is cold and seeing as your piss is hot when it comes out and all the nervendings in and on it it will cause pain but if it hurts everey time go the the doctor
f5YkKvidaa	How long did she had her addiction to reading twilight series? why don't you start reading a book with her not about vampires. So she can start liking something different.if that  doesn't work take her to a counselor or  her parents to talk about mary's problem. hope this helps|`|WoqKWkQaaa	you'll need to take some action and take her to a councilor at school.  just like other books/movies, the pizazz will all go away and if she still is obsessed, then people will think she's crazy.  give her posters of a band or introduce her to something else she'll like or give her other books about other vampires (ex:dracula) and slowly try to give her other books that will take her away from twilight.  it's ok if she still likes it, but she needs to not focus so much on it. best of luck|`|S8GHHumHaa	this is odd. i also love twilight but not to that length. Perhaps you should have her read one of your books that is really good that is NOT about vampires. if that doesn't work then talk to one of her parents about psychiatric  help.|`|0PHlRWmpaa	...wow. I would point out that real vampires don't have reflections or show up on film, first of all. Oh, and that they don't exist.|`|BPwpQV6faa	what's wrong with wanting to be a vampire? i totally understand her. Back off! or i'll bite you.

aEVUEWbqaa	Sounds like you are on the right road! I suggest to all my patients Chloraseptic throat spray. So what you do is you spray it on your gums. NOT your throat! B'cause you throat is not what hurts. Anyhoo it has a numbing agent that will help you get through the brushing. Follow the Directions and wait about 45 seconds to a minute, then brush!|`|bRexdYL4aa	oragel thats what i do and it works
cilYUWgtaa	Mostly, you'll just get annoyed. Spray paint, while toxic, is more so toxic to inhale or get into your eyes. Getting it on your skin won't do anything, unless you're allergic to something in the paint.|`|M5XjqI40aa	Nothing. It'll wear off in a few days with a little scrubbing as your skin exfoliates.|`|1L5Uq3voaa	...? What are you worried about? Wash it off...or wait a few days until it wears off.     I mean, no, you shouldn't cover yourself in spray-paint every day or anything, but it's not going to kill you.|`|AA10529994	Why???  It'll wear off in a few days of washing or you can use a bit of paint remover on a rag if you that worried.|`|v6yMBpB0aa	nothing will happen to you, if you want you can try acetone or nail polish remover to try and get it off but it will come off by itself in time and it will not hurt you.|`|6ch5VRzTaa	nothing just wash it off or read the warning on the back because i don't use spray paint very often and you need to be sure if it careful
gkqmrIAGaa	Someone in my family has BPD and takes Trazadone, Lithium and Effexor. The Trazadone is a combination antidepressant and antianxiety, the Lithium is an antipsychotic and the Effexor is an antidepressant. But nobody but your psychiatrist can prescribe the right combination for you. It is a matter of some trial and errror as some medications will work for others but not for you. You have to be persistent in your search for the right combination.  I know that you suffer and I am very sorry. Please keep trying if you haven't found the right ones for you. You should be in therapy also. There are specific therapies for BPS. There is also a very good book "I Hate You, Don't Leave Me, which was written by a woman who grew up with BPD and her success in learning to lead a normal life.  Take Care of Yourself"  You are loved!.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	I have borderline personallity disorder. i have been on gabapentin and now Naltrexone. The gabapentin as a relaxant which worked well and still does. The Naltrexone is prescribed for an opiate addiction. IT has helped alot more than the gabapentin. It takes away aggression and turns off thoughts of self harm. I've been on Naltrexone for about 2 years now getting better everyday.
L1z5qydSaa	which part of your lip? It can be a pimple, but some acne cream or even rubbing alcohol (i know, gross) sometimes popping it is the only way to get rid of it unfortunately. Have it dry out first though.
ACyl5uQMaa	There are many formulas you can purchase from your super market that has anti-licing chemicals within them, within this chemical it also has the affect to kill the eggs, either by suffocation of the lice of toxicity. There is a strong formula known as "selsun". There is another way to tell for lice is by purchasing a lice comb, these combs have lots of close hard bristles that will be able to pick some up in your hair.    Since you were out door's and there are no signs of head lice, it could have been a small tick. If this is the case, get your parents to thoroughly check again.     Head lice as a very common problem and can be easily treated with simple pharmaceutical or shopping market shampoo's.    I hope this has helped and don't worry, head lice aren't dangerous, just annoying!|`|9UmA8evjaa	After shampooing and conditioning you will need to blow dry your hair on the hottest setting you can stand. Youre going to still have to sit down and comb through tiny sections of hair and pick the eggs off one by one. No matter the remedy that you use you will still need to do this step of it. I know its slow and takes forever but you must do it. You will need to rewash with the shampoo on days 3, 7, and 10. Make sure to use a deep conditioner so you don't dry your hair out to bad. You will also need to comb through and recheck for eggs on those days. Or try searching for homeopathic remedies products that will help you to overcome head lice naturally.|`|sOgLLlDraa	I would have your mom check once more. Behind the ears and by your neck are the worst spots. If she doesn't see anything you might just be overreacting. You can go ahead and buy the shampoo and use it just incase. You can also use vaseline as a second precaution. You put it in your hair and comb the lice out. That method is used for younger kids too young to use the shampoo.    Remember that no matter how clean you are you can get lice. It doesn't make you a dirty or nasty person.|`|XLAxyOEDaa	dye ur hair....the chemicals kill them|`|Fn4kxmLEaa	Well, it's defiantely not a tick. Ticks can't be squished and wouldn't make a popping sound. You can only kill a tick by burning or drowning. It's probably lice. I would buy the shampoo anyway, it wouldn't hurt. I don't think lice make a popping sound though, weird. Use the shampoo! Good luck!
tS4t9Lndaa	No, that is not alot.Are you taking any medications? PVC's are a common arrythmia and usually benign. Have you had a holter monitor study to confirm this?  Did you Dr. check your bloodwork?  Did you have an echocardiogram to check for any structural problems with your heart?  I once had five thousand with my holter study.
nXPbiw4Naa	Idk no either but there is this one company online with boy models around the age of 10 and 12. www.tigerunderwearstore.com|`|B3Cd58ehaa	Boys shouldnt model underwear untill they become 16 on. but that is my opinion.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	People Against Anything That Moves banned them.|`|vbyxckpdaa	hahaha great question|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Guys don't like to buy stuff with other guys bits on them.|`|BAlYRNN8aa	Just my opinion but i woudnt really want to see pictures of little boys in their underwear lol.|`|0JERmAslaa	they got AIDS and died|`|4200378addfd689cbc4359a6f8b5ca26aa	Hmmm.

12Q6ZKqCaa	The great majority of moles are simply moles, but there are features that make a mole suspicious for melanoma. These features can be remembered by the initials A, B, C, D and E:        * Asymmetry,      * Border irregularities,      * Color changes within the mole,      * Diameter large (greater than 6-7 mm), and      * Enlargement with time.    I wouldn't get anything removed that wasn't unnecessary, but if it bothering you, I would weigh the options.|`|dnld9tqhaa	why do you care???|`|7KGXRu19aa	YES.. at least get it looked at|`|2wvKmongaa	If the mole has Grown or produced more hair then normal get it checked!!!
150esu4Daa	Maybe a little higher, but you shouldn't worry. My aunt has lupus and none of her kids do. I have lupus though, so there obviously is a genetic component there, but you can't worry about it too much. Lupus is manageable, although not much fun. You should always inform new doctors about all of your family medical history, including your mother's lupus diagnosis so that you doctor can keep it in mind when ever you have a medical problem. Good Luck!|`|BUI2nlUVaa	Just a slightly higher chance than the normal population.  It is thought that genetics and environment (ie stress, illness, etc) contribute to Lupus.
GLvLe2lAaa	I am looking for one for my family too to help them deal with my health issues.  I have found a few yahoo and google groups that are for family members of specific conditions.  Also, there are probably groups that you can find through local or major hospitals.
AA11944162	Its probably normal since its your first period but if your still worried go doctor.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	i have a freind whose period lasts 12 days every month! its different for everyone.     the more food you eat on your period, the more blood is produced.     my friend ended up on the pill to shorten her periods...the only downside is it makes you gain weight.|`|juMKsO6laa	Since its your first period your body is still getting used to it, so it will take a couple months/years till it gets normal.|`|ixJSutYuaa	It is normal for the length to fluctuate. Especially when you are a teenager and your cycle is just starting.|`|2VNuWkzvaa	i was 12 when i first started my period, i got it for 9 days straight, then i didnt get until like 4 months later, it was irregular until i was sexually active when i was 17.  its normal. if it goes past 10 days try birth control to control it.|`|ufTjv25Jaa	Don't worry. You are the exact same as me. My first period lasted 8 days. If it goes longer than ten days without any signs of stopping (eg. getting lighter), you should maybe see a doctor.

Don't worry about it :)|`|65cBvdqraa	it'll be over soon  periods usually last around a week  and if you just started then of course yours will be irregular.  after this one's over you might not have another one for months!!  thats what happened to me.      just tell your mom and see what she says  but if it doesnt let up soon  make sure you tell her  so she can take you to a doctor.      but i dont think you'll have to worry.|`|eXYldVRUaa	Since your just started, you're hormones are still developing. They will be unstable for the first year.  But don't worry, it's normal have irregular periods the first time you start. When I first started, I had a 2 month period.  I went to the gynecologist and I was put on a low dosage of birth control. It went back to normal quickly.

RGvNRH8Iaa	A lot of times teeth are not actually that easy to pull, especially if they are molars and/or they are decayed.  Sometimes the teeth will break apart when the dentist tries to pull them, and your gums may have to be cut to get all the pieces of the teeth out (ouch, I know).  I think your dentist is probably doing the right thing.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	both - talk to him and get another opinion.  if they are impacted meaning not fully surfacing - you may need them surgically removed.|`|AA10303012	Why not just ask your dentist why he is sending you elsewhere instead of doing it himself, there's probably a good reason|`|AA11612766	Trust me.  Have an oral surgeon do it.  Put you under and there's much less pain.  Had one wisdom tooth pulled...total agony...two weeks of pain.  Had the other three pulled by an oral surgeon and it hurt for about a week.|`|0ffa3071ec5d97e40f2988e5bf8d9e8faa	Some or most Dentists do not perform extractions any more, that is why you were referred to an oral surgeon.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well depending on what teeth they are. Are the wisdom and if so they usually always send out to an oral sugeon because of the complicated roots of those teeth and also if they aren't all the way thru they need to cut thru the skin to get them.     Some dentists only do the basic stuff and then send out for root canals, pulling, braces, etc.|`|0d4c9f6122693a445077a17a9d8ceb08aa	Trust me - get a second opinion. I have made a major dental mistake by not doing that. And by all means, make sure that an oral surgeon does the job.
2aG0ARncaa	There is NO SUCH THING as hypoallergenic cats.   Bengals included!    Beware of ANY breeder who tries to sell you a "hypoallergenic" cat. Plain and simple: It's a scam.    Bengals DO shed!! Generally speaking Bengals shed less than the average house cat, however, some Bengals shed like crazy! It took a little while to get my Marble Seal Lynx Point Bengal's shedding under control.     This may not be the answer you'd like to hear, but it is the unfortunate truth for animal lovers with allergies.
ACyl5uQMaa	Sometimes you can have loss of voice, depending on how chronic the infection is. There will defiantly be croakyness and changing in the voice. (obviously by bacteria infection of the pharynx). Just rest and try not to be over excessive with your voice, but there is a chance it may be lost for a little bit.
AA11155064	Cysts come in all manner of shapes, sizes and styles.    Pimples, acne and related blemishes are mini sized skin-surface types of examples. They don't usually grow large enough to be a major concern. Just as many pimples will have soft, ***** drain-able centres, and black-heads often have an oozy/cheesy centre, then white-heads often have hard "pea-like" cores that have to be popped rather than squeezed.    Similarly internal cysts tend to become larger before they are noticed and often have like properties. To attempt drainage was a responsible first option rather than do more unnecessarily.    Cysts, regardless of their size or location can occur for a multitude of reasons without there being anything sinister in their origin. If it were not for the discomfort or unsightliness (like acne) many could be reasonably left untreated without concern.|`|UP2WzIISaa	they cannot tell you its a cyst from simply looking at a utersound. i had a lump and it tured out to a cyst and a simple needle biopsy drained it. talk with your doctor again about this. good luck
37gKN2z1aa	There is no such thing as safe sex, abstinence is the only alternative.  If people would wait to have sex there would be a great decrease in problems in this world!    EDIT:    Seriously, I don't know why people would thumbs down this.  It is the truth.  Sex is more than just something to do.  It is a union between two people.  Them becoming one.  I waited til marriage and you know what... I enjoy sex more than any promiscuous person out there.  My spouse and I know each other so well it is a true mating of our bodies.  The only safe sex is between a husband and wife.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Well the couple of times I had unsafe sex I ended up with bacterial vaginitis.  It's awful!

If she likes doing these things and she doesn't feel faint or exhausted, i think she is doing great and just has a lot of energy. Also check her food intake if you see she doesn't eat much or is counting calories, that isn't normal for a teenager, because in that case she would be concerned about her weight and that could lead to anorexia or bulimia so just see that first. Also try talking to her, ask her if she doesn't feel overwhelmed but in a matter of fact kind of way not like a worried parent because she will feel like you are butting into her life and she won't tell you anything.I hope i helped a little bit.|`|rkjQpGNWaa	Encourage it.At her height her weight is not unhealthy,and her want to be busy will aid her greatly later in life.Don't be upset or worried,your destined to have a great successful,young woman for a daughter.|`|R3WzdVilaa	i dont think she is unhealthy   she is working out a lot   i think you should ask her to cancel one of her activities   her schedule seems really busy|`|AA10130443	My daughter is 14 and is also 5"1 and weighs 100 lbs and the doctor says that it's a healthy weight and not very close to even being overweight, so I think your daughter's weight is fine. My daughter has a pretty busy schedule too. Don't worry, as long as your daughter doesn't feel stressed eveything is okay. I constantly make sure my daughter doesn't feel too stressed by the number of activities she participates (including her sports), volunteer hours, and her homework.  If your daughter is stressed out by all these activities let her tell you which ones are her top priorities and that way you know which ones she can drop out of. Last month was tough for my daughter with all her activities and everything so I wanted her to quit a few of her activities instead, I got a reply from her that said she wasn't going to quit. She told me that she wasn't going to give up on anything and that the activities she attends are worth it. As a parent, I believe that it's okay for my kids to set up their own goals. All I have to do is make sure they aren't overworking themselves and not trying to achieve their goals while ruining their health (losing sleep, etc). I also make sure that I have at least one day of the week where my child can have some time to relax. And the results for her first quarter's grades  were all straight A+'s. You're daughter seems like the type of person who is going to push herself to do the best she can (like my daughter). You're raising a very wonderful child. Just support your daughter in her activities and make sure she remains healthy and keeps up healthy sleeping and eating habits.
pqnEavSyaa	The most common cause of arch pain is Plantar Fasciitis. Plantar Fasciitis involves inflammation of the Plantar Fascia - the fibrous band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. Someone with arch pain usually has inflammation of the tissues within the mid-foot.     Plantar Fasciitis is caused by over-stretching of the Plantar Fascia. Repeated strain can cause tiny tears in the ligament. These can lead to inflammation, irritation, pain and swelling. Arch pain is more likely to happen when:    -- the feet roll inward too much (over-pronation)    -- walking, standing, or running for long periods of time, especially on hard surfaces    -- excess weight    -- tight Achilles tendons and/or calf muscles    Medical studies on foot pain found that a combination of stretching exercises and wearing a standard, off-the-shelf orthotic shoe insert is the most effective way of dealing with arch pain.  This treatment regime is also very effective for the treatment of heel pain.    An explanation of the importance that proper arch support plays in controlling over-pronation, and some stretching exercises for relief are provided in the links below|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, this could be related to plantar fasciitis (an example only), but the only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
2eQlSoY1aa	Absolutely not. Any responsible lawyer you contacted would most likely attempt to stifle his or her laughter and send you on your way.  Malpractice is a breach of duty.  Whoever inserted your IV was doing so because it was within his or her scope of practice and was part of your treatment plan.  IV insertion is not as traumatic and dangerous as you think; the risk of "air" or infection is extremely low, especially since no medication was administered through the IV and you need MUCH more "air" than you think to even cause trouble. You survived this without trauma or infection so just let it be.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I doubt it.

It is almost invisible now..... almost|`|TjIun1f9aa	The stretch marks you can see originate from the deeper, dermal levels of your skin, and cannot be repaired or masked by lotions or creams that only reach the epidermal layers of your skin. There is no topical cure for stretch marks, and they are genetic. Some researchers believe that the amount of collagen and elastin in one's dermal layer of the skin is what causes the presence or absence of the marks. If you are blessed with an abundance of collagen and elastin you may avoid the stretch marks, but if you did not inherit the "good skin genes" then you may have to live with them, or like others have suggested consider surgery.

iFYDJyIZaa	It shouldn't make it heavier or longer. I do this all of the time, and I've always had the same amount of blood each month. Probably won't cause any side effects either.    But, I would suggest speaking to your doctor if you're concerned. :)|`|9kHN3ar0aa	it's ok to skip your period and it should come at the same time next month like always. it may be a little heavier but since you have 7 placebo pills your period shouldn't last longer than 7 days. there shouldn't be any severe side effects...at the most maybe a little spotting.|`|d554b01f24aafacca61036628777e067aa	you should be ok|`|5Kt8qlytaa	It could make your next period a little heavier.  You shouldn't have any other complications.  There is actually birth control pills that you take for 3 months straight without any placebos and only have 4 periods a year.  I believe it's called seasonque or something like that.  I wouldn't suggest doing it every month because you do need to have a regular period.  I am on the patch and I sometimes don't take a week off and don't have a period that month.  It's perfectly normal.  If you have any more concerns ask your GYNO.|`|UqvGKax1aa	no, it won't be heavier or longer/|`|wtg8vtzBaa	No, I don't think so.

6NZeItMAaa	Allowing self induced stress to control your life or even enter your life is like volunteering to be shot out of a cannon. Other people will watch you appear to soar, but in reality, you will be in a lot of pain that could end up to prove fatal, even if it is just metaphorically.    Stress is usually at the root of all of the above psychological disorders. It also affects us physically as well. Stress has been linked to every disease known to man, including heart disease and cancer. Clearly, it is not a good idea for people to be under stress. But, as human beings, we are going to experience stressful situations. There is no avoiding this fact. Therefore, in order to really be able to help cure ourselves from being stressed out we need to know how to do the following:    ? Identify stressors that affect our daily lives;  ? Eliminate the stressors of which we can free ourselves;  ? Learn to deal with stressful situations in a healthy way    If you are one of the millions of people who are feeling stressed out, you must take a look at the reasons why you are stressed out and try to do what you can to eliminate as much stress as you can from your life.    Try to have positive reactions to stress    Proper diet, exercising, yoga, meditating, massage therapy, aromatherapy, talking your problems out with a therapist or friend and so on.
f8mLpPXlaa	The lymphocyte count  doesn't relate to the COPD. The platelet count also doesn't relate. What does matter are the red cells and the hemoglobin. That's what transports the O2. Platelets have to do with blood clotting. And the white cell count, lymphocytes, basophiles, eosinophiles, etc. have to do with the body's defense against infection or as you said a foreign protein.

Wz9tSKTaaa	I think the perspective of that picture may be making the needle look bigger/thicker than it is.    In the UK there is local anaesthetic available on request. It used to be given as standard but they found that some people found a having a cold, numb patch on their arm more irritating than the pain of the needle. (That should give you a sense of the pain level - people usually expect it to be worse than it is.)    If you're more concerned about seeing it, it should be possible to look away the whole time. That's what my housemate (who freaks out at the sight of blood) is planning to do. You won't be putting the needle in or taking it out, and the donation will be over in ten minutes.    I hope you do donate. Blood stocks are lower in the winter, and you'll feel justifiably smug afterwards. Good luck!|`|AA12284392	If you're diabetic, you can't donate blood.|`|0lCnu1g2aa	yes it is the needle or similar to the needle.  The nurses or techs that will be collecting the blood do that all day long and are very good "sticks". It does hurt for a minute and the feeling of knowing your helping others usually takes away the pain.  Best wishes.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	The needle isn't going to kill you.|`|jdVxsK4yaa	yep...u shouldnt do it if ur scard. y make urself do what u dont need 2 do. if your scared  stay da hell away from it|`|OMcIR0gYaa	yeah i hate needles too but it would be over in a little bit... just think, your could be helping someone who need the blood badly ^_^ unfortunately i cannot give blood i have TB... they told me even though its inactive i still cant ;_; be glad you still can|`|5UJSX3vJaa	tell the nurse to punch you in the face than you can avoid giving blood with the needle method and go to the bloody nose method|`|Mr0rTg8saa	Aww you cant be scared though.

Dont let fear prevent you from doing good!|`|fkqPs9QRaa	think of how many little kids can get blood drawn with no problem.....|`|XKhNw221aa	yes that is the needle, but think of the 3 people whose lives you could help save if you got over your fears.|`|m4vUUGOyaa	i honestly doubt that is the needle and if you want ask for the smallest needle they have such as the butterfly needle. remember this too, it will only hurt for a second while other people are suffering forever e.g. people diagnosised with cancer. So remember that if you do give blood your saving someones life and you will feel good about it.|`|AsDMUcciaa	Yes, it is. I know it looks huge, but it really isn't that bad. It doesn't go in very deep at all, and with a good nurse you barely even feel the prick. You don't have to watch either; if you tell the nurse needles bother you, she'll be sure to give you a chance to look away. Odds are you won't even notice it go in. And that blood might well save someone's life.    From personal experience, I'd have to say it's best to face your fears. It's hard, but would you rather do it on your own terms, or someday in the hospital when you need an IV?|`|HKHCuRI8aa	that is for plasma giving-that takes the blood out and through machine then back in you,,     To give blood you will save a life so do it. It is a small normal needle.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	it's not that bad.|`|FPONPOlHaa	if ur so scared, turn up the music and concentrate on that while someone pokes u with a needle|`|iOVSk2Lyaa	yes it is but you just feel a slight pinch. you may get nauseous and dizzy however.|`|Jxq4TIavaa	hmmm your gonna be glad that you got it over with. but i dont think the needle is gonna be that big O_O|`|1dec0c403afbc3dd0a911739a0577fbaaa	I believe that is similar to the needle that they use. But take it from someone who really doesn't like needles, it isn't that bad. I have given blood a half dozen of times and I am always really nervous. But I usually take someone with me, and I look away, and I hardly feel it, maybe right at first and that's it. It's NOT bad. Hopefully you'll be able to do it and get the wonderful feeling of pride that you get following the donation. Best of luck and be brave!
BXLCiCUlaa	you could hit the gym and do bicep curls and other arm workouts. I am not  sure how old you are, so im not sure what kind of progress you could make. If your younger than around 15-16, you probably wont see as much of a return on your workouts. Muscle growth is a gradual process, you cant become a beast overnight, otherwise everyone would be big. Work out and eat right (from all food groups). Do cardio for the fatness thing.   Good luck!    P.S.: the people telling you about the girl thing dont seem to understand.

3JUKOGOvaa	I noticed my ocd when I was young too maybe younger than 10. I lived with it mostly and never got medical attention. I take inositol which I wanted to try before taking any more meds and it works well. Inositol 6-10g a day and 50mg 5-htp b4 bed eliminates ocd completely! Ocd aint that bad it's something you learn to live with for sure. It's about obsessing about important things and not unimportant things that will help you get through.

I would say you have mild OCD (detracts from your life one hour or less per day and causes no physical harm). At this point just deal with these quarks the best you can. My advice would be to not try to repress them but accept it AS LONG AS the obsessions do not worsen.|`|7gcdOCbtaa	Abigail,     Don't get so upset. It is not the end of the world.

pZFp9qUUaa	if your ACL tore, you would KNOW IT. it's excruciating pain, and you wouldn't be able to ignore it. but still you might have definitely pulled or strained something. so ice it for a while. ice helps a lot in different situations. and try to stay off it a lot.     if it still hurts, talk to your doctor! you might just need a little treatment.

You will lose weight.|`|nWgTur4qaa	I don't think you can target an area, I think you need to get your metabolism up.     Activity  Calories Burned per Hour  Bicycling, 6 mph 240  Bicycling, 12 mph 410  Cross-country skiing 700  Jogging, 5? mph 740  Jogging, 7 mph 920  Jumping rope 50  Running in place 650  Running, 10 mph 1280  Swimming, 25 yds./min. 275  Swimming, 50 yds./min. 500  Tennis, singles 400  Walking, 2 mph 240  Walking, 3 mph 320  Walking, 4? mph 440      Here is a list of foods that will wake up your metabolism and help you flush fat out of your system.    Citrus Fruits    Citrus fruits like, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons, and limes contain high concentrations of Vitamin C (this is also called ascorbic acid). This Vitamin C has a fat burning quality.    Vitamin C reduces the effectiveness of fat. It reduces its content and can liquefy or dilute fat. By diluting the fat, it makes it less effective, and easier to flush out of your system. Vitamin C also works on cholesterol deposits. Vitamin C can help burn out the cholesterol, hence, making it difficult for cholesterol deposits to form in blood vessels.    By adding Citrus Fruits to your daily diet, try every meal and also a snack, you will great increase your metabolism, increase your ability to get rid of fat, and also help you to control your cholesterol levels.    Soybeans    Soybeans contain lecithin, this chemical will shield your cells from accumulating fat. This chemical prevents, like a shield, fat from forming on your cells. It will also break down fatty deposits in your body.    Eat soybeans at least 3 times a week and you'll be boosting your bodies ability to get rid of fat. You can find soybeans in most health food stores.    Apples, Berries, Fresh Fruit    Apples contain a chemical call pectin. This chemical is found in most berries, and fresh fruit. The pectin is in the cell walls of most fruits, especially apples.    Pectin limits the amount of fat your cells can absorb. This will put a natural limitation on the amount of fat your cells can absorb. Pectin, once in your system, has a water binding property, it absorbs watery substances, and these watery substances in turn bombards the cells and makes it release fat deposits.    Add applesauce (it's loaded with pectin), apples, fresh fruit and berries, to your diet and let the power of pectin pulverize the fat that accumulates on your cells. An apple a day can help keep the fat away.    Garlic Oil    Garlic oil or the juice of garlic has a significant protective quality to cells which help to reduce fatty deposits. When taken, it brings down the levels of fat. Garlic, garlic oil, or anything with garlic, also has an antibiotic property to it and can be used to cure many ailments. Please look at a home remedies page I wrote and you'll see all the uses garlic has to offer, but in brief, it can be used as an antibiotic, it also destroys bacterial infections, and has the power to reduce fat in your cells dramatically.     Diuretic    What is a Diuretic? A diuretic is a medication or chemical that promotes the elimination of fluid in the body. This can lead to an accelerated metabolism that seems to flush out the fatty deposits that may lodge themselves on cells. Diuretics break down fatty deposits into small chunks and makes it easier for your body to flush these nasty little things out of your body.    Asparagus    Asparagus contains the chemical asparagine. This is an alkaloid that stimulates the kidneys and improve the circulatory process. These alkaloids directly effect the cells and break down fat. It also contains a chemical that helps to remove waste from the body by breaking up the oxalic acid, this acid tends to glue fat to cells, so by breaking the acid up, it helps to reduce fat levels.    Beets    Beets are a strong diuretic that focuses on the liver and kidneys. Beets flush out floating body fats. They have a special iron the cleanses the corpuscles, corpuscles are blood cells that can contain fat deposits.    It also contains a chlorine that also helps to flush out fatty deposits. This chlorine stimulates the lymph which will clear out the fat deposits.    Brussel Spouts    This vegetable stimulates the glands, the pancreas especially, which releases hormones the has a cleansing effect on the cells. There are also minerals the stimulate the kidneys. Waste is released quicker and it helps to clean out the cells.    Cabbage    This cleanses your body of waste matter because it contains sulphur and iodine, which helps to cleanse the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. Cabbage is a great food if you should have a pot belly or a middle age spread. The diuretic cabbage will help to break up the fat in this area.    Carrots    Carrots contains carotene, a form of Vitamin A, this carotene will start a fat flushing reaction in your system. This reaction will literally wash out fat and waste quickly. The carotene will be transformed into vitamin A in the intestines and this process will create a|`|JiE0pwv7aa	your current weight x 12= calories needed to maintain your current weight    to lose 1lb a week you need to cut 500 calories   to lose 2lb a week you need to cut 1000 calories|`|AA12133859	You dont really need to lose weight according to the Body Mass Index (BMI)  even if you are 5'1 and weigh 110 your BMI is 20.8 that as you can see below is well within the normal range.     *  Underweight =       * Normal weight = 18.5-24.9      * Overweight = 25-29.9      * Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater    That said, working out and watching what you eat so you maintain your health is a good idea.

AA12066269	There are a lot of unknown reasons why someone gets cancer.  Only a very small percentage is genetic.  My aunt, sister and I all have had breast cancer and it wasn't the due to the BRCA1 BRCA2 genetic mutation.    There could be environmental reasons that haven't been discovered yet, or foods, additives, plastics, etc that they just don't know about...|`|NE3vbxHNaa	sometimes it just develop by itself|`|1jwk8LHAaa	hi  i'm found the good blog related with your problem found this blog in http://drugtreatmentforcancer.blogspot.c...

AA10752922	Well---first thing you must do is get on a balanced diet.  A good way to boost you're metabolism is by eating small portions of healthy food (one food idea is oatmeal-raisins and spice by quaker instant)  6 times a day.  Take some green tea pills with hoodia (Target has them).  Also a daily vitamin is good.  Drink alot of water.Try walking for a bit and mix in some jogging when you can.  Lift some light weight but do alot of reps.  I did this routine during this past summer and dropped 30 lbs in 3-4 months.  I still do all the same things now.  I put on 10 winter pounds but thats coming off soon.  Give it a try.  It worked for me--I'm 38 and feel really great.  Most energy I've had in a long time.|`|YI9d2k6Iaa	Here is where you can read a good article called "Top Ten Principles and Tips for Weight Loss"    http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weig...  They are good tips that work.|`|1xJYTRVXaa	use slimfast or go 2 goldsgym|`|mKDSnQO5aa	cut out bread, noodles, any thing white! except eggs. eat 1200 calories a day|`|P8U1auMmaa	I think that you should be determinded to lose wait by doing a daily amount of crunches and push-ups or morning jogs. You can also buy the iron gym online that will help.|`|RjXh6T1waa	Go to the gym for at least 3 hours. Spend it on the treadmill. It will come off fast trust me. I'm 14 years old and I used to weigh 146 pounds. Then my mom starting taking me to the gym and all I did was run on the treadmill because I thought it was cool. But my weight came right off. I went from a size 7 to now a 00. And I now weigh 102 pounds. It works.

They claim to have remedies out there that works, but I can tell you firsthand it is better to just have the surgery. If they are unable to break them up with ultrasound then your best bet it to have it removed. The recovery time is not as bad as it used to be. My Mom suffered with hers for over 10 years and it finally got to the point where it almost burst and she could have died if left.     These are just things are unpreventable and you just have no choice, but to get it fixed if you want to live. No natural thing is gonna help you.
fAcVndo7aa	Most of what the doctor will do can be done at home, but it should still be checked out to make sure the bones are not displaced.  An x-ray will show if the bones are out of place or fragmented, which could require more extensive treatment.  If it is just a minor break, then the doctor will apply a splint to hold the finger in position while it heals.  Finger splints are available at most pharmacies and medical supply stores, or you can tape the finger to the one next to it to stabilize it.  You really should get it checked by a doctor first, though.|`|hoDin3UYaa	Yes. The doctor can X-Ray it and determine if it needs to be reduced, and by open or closed means. The doctor will also decide the best treatment option. Any broken bone should be seen by an Orthopedic Doctor.|`|JfumPukYaa	put it in a stint or make your own|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well with a broken finger you always need to have it checked out to make sure it is a clean break and  bone fragments or misplaced. Some broken fingers require surgery and others just something as simple as a splint until it heals.

rJRyVZhvaa	As for the flu, it is airborne;  Eating food off of the floor is abit nasty, because it will have bacteria and other contaminants (think of who might have stepped in that area, and what they may have stepped IN- use your own imagination!!!).    Try to use some common sense next time- there will be other tortilla chips to eat (that weren't on the floor (hopefully!!), and if your friend dares you to do this again, dare them to eat half and you eat half, and after (s)he eats his/her half,  tell them that you're not hungry! ;-))    (Someone tried this on me, so I dared him to eat half, and HE ATE IT!!

f8mLpPXlaa	I'm afraid it sounds like small airway closure. When you prolong a note  your lungs gradually empty. (obviously) but when you get to the end the last part of your lungs to empty is the smallest airways. They may be closing prematurely You say you have mild asthma. I would get this checked out by a pulmonologist who can do breathing tests to check for just that problem. And he might have a solution for you.
flKkoiwbaa	Contrary to popular belief, 98.6 is an average normal temperature, but what is "normal" can vary from person to person.  Some people may have an average body temperature that is a degree or two higher or lower than 98.6.      In response to illness, the body will generally raise its temperature, although in some cases your temperature may go down a bit during some phases of an illness.  This is more common in older adults.  You can have a "normal" temperature and still be sick.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Yeah you are okay.  Some virus infections can cause a temporary dip in temp.  But it isn't dangerous or anything.|`|4Gt3ZVqsaa	It just means u are sick. Average body temperature is about 98 depending on the person. A temperature can be high or low.
I2gMIWDeaa	Usually no.  When I saw him in High School Musical, he looked a bit plump.  This was strange given that he is a dancer.  He looked more out of shape than his co-star, Zac Efron who had an excellent body.  When I saw him again in High School Musical 2, he was thinner and looked much better.  In his case, he looks good now, so if he weighs 140, than no.  He is not fat.|`|6OeEivbgaa	it depends on his height.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	PLease ask Lucas.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Holy ****!

Sozc3MyFaa	The answer is not that simple.  You can have many kinds of neck fractures as you can break the spinal processes, the bodies and the connections in different areas.  You can also break the neck at any point along the 7 vertebra and the results are vastly different.  Finally, you can break your neck but not damage the spinal cord (this is the vital issue), you can have a partial transection or a complete one.  SO, signs would range from death to nothing and a full continuum in between.  Some signs might be: unable to move legs, unable to breathe, pain at the neck, swelling in the front of the neck area, difficulty breathing, unable to move arms, etc.  Not all neck fractures are dangerous however; some do not even need treatment,|`|J3fFR3Wuaa	you might be a tad bit dead|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	they'd be dead. if they happened to live, they wouldn't be able to keep their head up. they would be in a lot of pain, probably the worst pain imaginable, and they might also be paralyzed.|`|AA10531094	More than likely they would be dead with a broken neck.  It's rare for people to live with one.|`|Z9aEClXnaa	it would be so intense they would be hurt so bad they might die right on the spot. or would lay flat saying something or saying nothing because there neck hurts so bad and if still alive rushed to the hospital.|`|Xx2fMy1Xaa	The person with a broken neck could not breath very well. If not broken bad enough, they would cry. If somebody broke there neck, call the emergency room! ASAP!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Dead or paralyzed.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Quadriplegia!|`|MSb3gi3Caa	90% of neck breaks result in paralysis/death|`|suVispAAaa	They would be in a lot of pain & most likely not be able to move there neck at all.|`|ffIxXw9Uaa	they would probaly be paralized in atleast there legs and in alot of pain!!!!|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	If your neck breaks you either become paralized or die!|`|v2ZBawa7aa	They would have neck pain.  Often they would be quadriplegic, if there is compression/damage of the spinal cord.  They could die.  Some people with a broken neck without much spinal cord damage are able to have a halo brace put on that has to be worn for months to allow the neck to heal.  Once the break is healed, these lucky people are able to live normal lives for the most part.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	It depends on where the neck was broken.     If you break the C3, C4, or C5 vertebrae, the nerves that come out of the spinal cord in that area enervate the diaphragm and control breathing. Breaking C3, 4, or 5 will discontinue the patient's ability to breathe on his/her own.     Most breaks result in paralysis, usually from the injury site downwards, resulting in quadriplegia.    However, in rare cases the spinal column remains aligned until further trauma or movement. This is why after an accident with severe trauma in which the neck may have been injured, it is important to protect the neck and spine until doctors can be certain that the spinal column is not compromised. It's happened before that someone in a car accident thinks they're fine and gets out of the car, only to twist or bend later on, misplacing the break in their spinal column, and resulting in paralysis.    If you think you or someone you know may have broken or injured their neck, even if it's been a little while, go get checked out immediately.|`|2vSxgAkDaa	death|`|FL0S2tSCaa	I don't know...

AA12005237	There's no way to say how much weight you will lose, or if you will lose any at all.    Personally, I lost 15 lbs in about a month of being vegan (I'm 5'3", and I went from about 180-185lbs. to 165lbs.), but I was also doing a lot of physical activity... I walked EVERYWHERE. On the other hand, my sister, who was quite a bit thinner than I, gained 7 pounds from going vegan in the same amount of time.    But, regardless of whether you lose weight or not, cutting out meat, as long as you make sure to get plenty of protein, along with eating a balanced diet could make you feel healthier.    If you go into being vegetarian with the intention of losing weight, you may be disappointed. Everyone's body is different, and your healthiest weight is different from my body or some arbitrary standard decided on by industries trying to sell people something (diet industry, "health" industry, etc.). You might not lose any weight at all, but that doesn't mean that being vegetarian isn't a healthier lifestyle choice for you.    Contrary to what the mainstream media would have you think though, weight is not necessarily an indicator of physical health.  Health is a much too vague of a word, encompasses a wide range of attributes (mental and physical) and it is different for everyone.    The most important thing is to do what feels best for your body.  Since it might take awhile for your body to get used to going from the animal-product heavy (typical) American diet, to a more vegetable based diet, you might not feel better immediately, which is why the most important thing when considering a vegetarian diet is not to focus on the purported health benefits (which may have been exaggerated), but on reducing cruelty. Just the knowledge that you are saving up to a 100 animals a year by your dietary choices will most likely make you feel healthier (at least mentally) and happier since you aren't contributing to animal cruelty. How much your body (or more specifically, your weight) will change is anyone's guess.     Good luck on your new choice, and congratulations on deciding to make a positive impact with your life!|`|y1TDricRaa	As long as you know how to substitue meat well, lots of vegetarians get sick because they do not do it right, because you loose a lot of important vitamins and minerals from eating meat.

It only affects the way in which you receive the nutrients, so if you are going vegetarian, you should be taking a daily vitamin supplement.    When your body doesn't receive all the nutrients it needs, it sends hunger/craving messages to your brain, causing you to eat more and mostly unhealthy products.    Moral of the story: if you don't get all the nutrients, you'll get more cravings, = gain weight rather than lose.|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	Not just from becoming vegetarian.  I did and I gained weight.

fMBREYmNaa	i think they are very similiar, watch this video and get a professionals opinion|`|KXZm6rfRaa	Yes there is a difference.    Plastic surgery derives its name from the term -plasty, a suffix meaning surgical repair.    the medical definition of cosmetic is "serving to preserve or promote appearance".    Many procedures could be considered both plastic and cosmetic surgery.  A nose job is a rhinoplasty, is it cosmetic?  Perhaps.  If it is done only for appearances sake, then yes.  If it was done to correct a deviated septum or repair damage due to an accident, then no.    If your face was crushed in an accident you would need a plastic surgeon to rebuild it.  Not a cosmetic surgeon.    Many Dr. who have no training in plastic surgery do cosmetic procedures.   Dermatologists come to mind, many do botox or demabrasions which are truly cosmetic.  Many other kinds of specialists perform this cosmetic work.    A good plastic surgeon will have done a residency or fellowship in plastic surgery at a major hospital.     This is who you want when you need your face returned to normal when they wheel you into an ER after a bad accident.  Not a "Cosmetic" Surgeon.    EDIT    The guy in the video is both a Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeon.  He does procedures that can be considered plastic, cosmetic, or both.
XtSQzlZfaa	your crap is green after eating veggies or something with die in it  if you have never had green crap before now.. well okay!|`|CS3W706xaa	hey whats up i am also 12 and it is just something you ate not anything serious|`|JkIm4nCzaa	ur fine its just something u ate thats all.. it happens :)
UPdJF0tyaa	i really think i have it too.    http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/symptom.h...    these are all the symptoms...hope this helps|`|ParFJxnSaa	There is an ADHD quiz, via page E, in section 1, at ezy build, below. A previous answer follows: AD(H)D is addressed in sections 22 - 25, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. They are not quick to act, but are very safe,and non-addictive. At http://www.mercola.com/ * enter "adhd" in the searchbar, and follow the links near the bottom of the webpage. ADHD was unheard of, 25 years ago, and now it is making billions of $ profit for pharmaceutical manufacturers, who spend an AVERAGE of $10,000*, on manipulating doctors in the USA, with rewads, and incentives to prescribe.    There is growing concern about the practice of medicating young people with powerful, and addictive central nervous system stimulants. Later on, when their parent's insurance coverage no longer covers them, due to age restrictions, many go on to abuse street drugs, with all the adverse consequences involved. The USA prescribes more of those stimulants than the rest of the world put together. If, despite the above, you still take them, check it first out at: http://www.drugs.com/ and http://www.rxlist.com/ and http://www.crazymeds.us/ and http://www.askapatient.com/ and at least be better informed about the risks than by the limited information risks and side effects in the enclosures, since the manufacturers are only obligated to warn about those effects reported. Many doctors fail to report such effects. ~~~    In your case, I suggest that you either: (1.) Switch to the natural methods, possibly by systematically weaning off your medication, as shown on page Z.22, in section 2, at ezy build, and use the following:  If you are one of the 40% of people who are fairly suggestible, you may wish to consider professional hypnotherapy, or http://www.asktheinternettherapist.com/h... -Improving Study Skills  CD - MP3 & Concentration and Focus CD - MP3 & Increasing Memory  CD - MP3  or at http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/ enter: "ADHD", & "studying", & "memory improvement" in the searchbar. "Classroom fascination" seems appropriate, in particular. (2.) Cut your medication in half, and use the alternative methods as complementary ones.|`|5rQnJZ8uaa	Many of the symptoms you have indicated could be associated with adhd however this condition is over diagnosed.  Maybe you are just a overactive person.  Maybe reanalize your diet cut out caffine, sugar, candy.  Becareful before you go on any medication. long term effects of these drugs are not known.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	talking fast, twitching and lack of concentration can be adhd but could also be bipolar disorder. both are closely linked but are separate diagnoses.|`|oN9vSZlhaa	Don't get hung up on what you "may have". If these symptoms you listed don't affect you negatively then forget about them. There are people around the US and world who take prescription drugs to have more energy, you've been gifted with that, embrace it.
OkR3hrzZaa	It sounds like a virus. The problem with virus's is that you cant really take an antibiotic for it. It just has to clear up on its own. Try taking something over the counter to treat the symptoms. Could you possibly be pregnant? Have you eaten anything different recently? I would give it about 7 days and if you are either getting worse or not better I would call the doctor. You can take some prilosec over the counter for the stomach pain. Some motrin for the headache and a lot of rest. Good luck!|`|nmrRgogKaa	Stomach/acid reflex and achey back is my guess. Go see a doctor.
5TM9P8tsaa	*You need to make an appointment with a doctor. He needs to send you for an MRI/US of that section. I see you love skating boarding. Have you fell down lately? It could be a fractured rib and it is just deferred pain which means that it feels like it is below the rib cage. Or it could be your gallbladder. That is why is directly under the rib cage. I was on duty when I had my pain there. A doctor was on our floor and said that is your gallbladder. He took me down to ER and gave me this GI cocktail to drink. Tasted horid but got rid of the pain. Ended up that he had to remove the darn gallbladder. My brother in law also had pain in that area and he had a fractured rib. So you never know till you see the doctor. Sorry|`|TqLPR72Daa	Maybe a stomach cold?
ParFJxnSaa	Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of very warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 2, 11, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to learn, (progressive muscular relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day.    An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, and pages 2.q, and 2.o, saying to yourself: "Even though I currently have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure. Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective.    Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.    Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea. I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, below, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you.     In section 3 at ezy build: INSOMNIA: PAGE O - INSOMNIA: A COMPREHENSIVE POST a variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing therapy is shown, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from insomnia, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and anxiety. It is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective; although it is easy to be dismissive of such a seemingly unusual technique, give it a good tryout, for at least a few weeks, to see if it is effective in your case. I learned it from a book by a published clinical psychologist, on depression insomnia, and now use it every night, and find it works well.    No coffee, tea, or other caffeine (see list in section 7) within 6 hrs of bedtime! Try a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3. Others may prefer Sleepytime, by Celestial Seasonings, Relax, Be Sleepy, or valerian root (valerian "hangovers" possible), from supermarket tea, or health food aisles. Milk, or cream should not be used with herbal tea. http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris  Get up and do something, like read a book, if you can't sleep within 20 mns. Personally, I prefer to use the EMDR, then word/phrase repetition for a short time, changing over to mindfulness breathing; however, you may well find another method more effective. Bright light, preferably sunlight, soon after awakening, (even if overcast) resets circadian rhythms, regulating melatonin production in the brain.|`|iybezfi6aa	Hi Shweetie, (cute name) Maybe you are a night person. Try taking a nap when you get home from school.|`|BhYDTUrWaa	lay down turn the tv and the computer of and go to bed lay there and go to sleep my sure that your mine is clear that will help so don't think about any thing|`|onkUcy19aa	Only prayer and meditation could help you in having a good night sleep, because there is no question of your using sleeping pills here due to your age.|`|vJxuWyueaa	First of all, limit yourself to a time that you must be in bed by. I know this sounds silly because no one has bed times, but I make myself go to bed by 11:00 every night (That doesn't mean you have to go to sleep by then, just make sure you are at least laying in bed), so I am awake for school/work. Next, by 12:00, make sure your lights, TV, computer, and anything else distracting are off. Then, you can just lay there and close your eyes, and day dream. This is the only time you will ever be able to day dream without getting in trouble for it, so take advantage of it Before you know it, you'll be out in no time!|`|Xz2EQusraa	Do what I do lay down and like make up a story like I do it like I have 16 kids and it just kinda goes and then I am asleep but normally I go through like 5 different stories cuz I like to think  Also I think you should try not drinking cofee and maybe ask your parents to get a trampoline so you can use that to get tired and also I am homeschooled so I don't have to wake up at any certain time but still I know how you feel. And try insomnia pills and a hot bath and maybe turn on some classical music|`|HabNtVcKaa	Humphrey's sells these little white pills that are all natural. They are made out of Valerian root. If you place a couple of them under your tongue they will help you get to sleep. They are not expensive and they sell them at many drug stores. There is also warm milk, but that can be kinda gross if you are not much of a milk drinker. Just remember to help any natural remedies work you also need to turn everything off to give your mind some time to settle down before you go to sleep.|`|pgst5RdVaa	take a hot bath turn everything off get ur iPod or mp3 lay there and trust me you will get knock out|`|2fc1TfiCaa	exercise.   I recommend Yoga, try searching the web for some yoga tutorials, do them before sleep.
4Uj2SJP1aa	If you are in school, there are a lot of germs around.  Imagine all the things being touched by everybody.  When you touch something avoid touching your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.  We were taught this at my job at one of our sanitation classes.  Try to wash your hands often, and if you can carry one of those sanitizer bottles with you.  Germs are everywhere and they make us sick, so we have to take precautions.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I know, I know this is gonna sound silly but here goes anyway. Keep your hands away from your mouth. Do not bite your nails, do not lick food off your fingers and wash them frequently. Think of it this way, (however gross) other people aren't as clean as you when it comes to hygiene. They grab doorknobs,  touch table tops etc. etc. This is not germophobia. I'm not saying obsess about  it but be more aware and you will get sick a lot less often, guaranteed.|`|AA12315164	Wash your hands a lot! it sounds dumb but its true im a nurse and that is one of the things we are told the most! good luck and feel better soon

Naps. Sometimes caffeine. Hope the head ache goes away!|`|lm0nlP04aa	Take over the counter pain medication such as Ibuprofen, which is also Motrin, or Advil.  But take three.  That is the amount the doctor said to take even though it states less on the bottle.  NEVER take more of Tylenol it is a different medication, take it as directed.|`|0uoYK4vHaa	take some advil..   go lay down in a dark, quiet room..|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	Caffeine is a quick fix, but if you take too much caffeine, you get addicted and start getting caffeine headaches.     Excedrin is a really good headache remedy. It has a light dose of caffeine, and it has some pain killers as well.    Avoid hot drinks. Don't chew ice. Take small bites of your food.    If they become chronic headaches, or if they're migraines, find out if you clench your jaw or grind your teeth. It's related.

DFJ9m4WKaa	FYI he's not asking whats a good "work out" per say, he's asking about jelqing which is an exercise technique that supposedly works out the penis and makes it larger.    So to answer the question: Jelqing works on the principle that by continually stretching the spongy tissue of the penis, they will expand and eventually prermanently hold more blood, thereby making the penis larger.    To be honest I have not found much medical data as to whether or not jelqing actually works. There are actually many different exercises a person can do. And some really can strengthen the muscles around the penis and allow for a firmer, longer lasting erection.    However I have not found any valid evidence that jelqing, or any exercise technique can actually enlarge the penis. In fact most sources I've come across are totally unreliable and generally want you to buy some product or pay for something.    Jelqing is also a good way to seriously injure the penis and do permanent damage. Of course, if done properly the risks are very low.    So what is a good regiment? Generally you want to jelq up to 300 times a day. But you need to work up to that number in 50 jelq incraments, increasing by 50 every week. After several weeks you should be doing a minimum of 300 jelqs a day, or for about 45-60 min. In order  for jelqing to be affective, you need to stick with it for a minimum of six months.    Because I don't have the time to explain all of this I've provided several links about jelqing.|`|215e8f63a273a9d5cbab203c741c8cecaa	Don't judge it by time.  Judge it by the color of your penis.  After a good workout your penis should be a dark red color, especially around the head.  That is the point where your blood vessels have enlarged enough to allow lots of blood near the surface of your skin, hence the purpose of the exercise has been met.  If you continue past that point then you risk injury.|`|YvNMUnR6aa	depends on how hard your workout is if you are sweating and think your about to collapse then its 30minutes if your not working as hard then an hour|`|WszlUGqcaa	2-3 hours a day should show results fast enough..if your workin hard enough..but make shure the next day you work out isnt the same muscles u worked out the day b for..tht can cause damage..as well as less deffinition...u need the muscles u have all ready worked out to rest so the soreness can grow on da muscles.

DmyqvxmJaa	Well, the best way to find out if you have them is to go to a doctor, but you can also do it at home. Ask another person to examine your scalp (if you have them, many will go to your head), and tell the person to look for things that look like moving grains of rice. Even if the person sees nothing on your head or anywhere else, you might want to visit a doctor to get a professional opinion. A pharmacist might even be willing to check you; lice are quite common. If it turns out you do have them, there's a shampoo you can buy to kill them in any drugstore.  And since I know that in Africa, where there's a high black population, lice is very common, I doubt there's any truth in the statement that African Americans can't get lice.    I hope this helps! :)|`|r5oL56xCaa	well just thinking about lice can make you paranoid, causing you to itch but just keep a look out for them like in your hair, and stuff, adn if you wanna go ahead and get shampoo for it then you can, adn then you don't have to worry about it as much.  it may make you feel better  =]|`|LXydtqlraa	check your hair strands along your roots (forehead/ around your ear/ bottom back of your head) for small sesame seeds. if it doesn't flick off, then it's not dandruff but a nest (nit). lice love clean hair (dirty hair is the best hair to style!)  if you do see these nits, mix 1/2 olive oil  with 1/2 vinegar, massage it into your scalp and hair. leave in, cover your head with a plastic bag and towel on top for an hour-to suffocate the lice. wash it out with shampoo with a few drops of tea tree oil. get someone to slide these nits off your hairstrands from the root all the way to the tips. do this everyday until those nits are gone.  my daughter came home with these lice because she stopped moisturizing her curls with coconut oil.

Water, a healthy breakfast, and sometimes slapping yourself also helps.|`|mG6K4uH1aa	Okay!  So!  Try reading the book for science before you get to class! Like, the night before, or whenever you can, just as long as it's before class. It's nice to feel smart during class, so if you already know even a little about the information, it might be easier to stay awake during class because then you could get involved with answering questions! Oh, and I'm on coffee right now, which might be why I'm so bouncy! So you could probably have some coffee in the morning, but not every day because it will stunt your growth!! Oh, and it will make your teeth brown if you drink a LOT of it. >_O    But yeah! Try to understand whatever it is that you need to know for class before the class, so then you want to get more involved. Try to keep yourself awake, okay? I know how boring classes are, but don't worry, you'll pull through! ;)|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	On days you don't have class are you still sleepy at the same time?|`|AA11744380	im guessing caffine.... or you could try to sleep longer i am tired unless i get 8-9 hours.... sorry im not much help|`|01biJjqEaa	While 7-8 hours of sleep sounds like a good enough amount, it actually isn't. Try 9-10 hours of sleep if you can. start your day with a little bit of exercising to get fully awake. A good breakfast will also help.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Buy some Adderall from your local drug dealer its a great way to start the day!

bjN4eaqUaa	Vitiligo is auto immune disorder in which white spots appear on skin. first small and lite pale mark appear  which slowly become white and grow in size. Normally it start with one or two spots and with passage of time more spots appear in different parts of skin.   When vitiligo spots are exposed to sun they began to burn.     However their are some other skin conditions also exist which causes white spots on skin.  As listed in the source given below.     However if you find confusion in diagnosing your spots  you may try Wood's Lamp experiment, a device to diagnose  skin diseases.|`|r5oL56xCaa	not sure, but it could be, you should probably read this link,      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo         then visit your dermetologist again, explaining that it is not a bacterea, and you have this for a pretty good amount of time now

So  no coffee at all or black.|`|mqDj4976aa	Splenda is made from sugar, so out of the sweeteners, it's not the worst in chemical content. Honey's a bad idea because it's full of sugar! However, being a diabetic, you really shouldn't be drinking coffee anyway (hey, don't kill the messenger)! Try some of the naturally sweet-tasting herbal teas and adjust your flavor palate to NOT needing to add a sweetener to your drink.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	No Splenda, no Sweet-n-Low, no Equal, no sugar, no honey.  Not too many options left.  You've elminated everything except Stevia - I thought that stuff was nasty tasting.  And even Stevia is processed to make the sweetener.  Use a little sugar if the idea is to stay away from chemicals and super processed stuff or train yourself to do without sweeteners.  Try different flavored coffees to make up for the loss of sweetness.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Black with coffee creamer.|`|AA11017638	ok if you are NOT diabetic. Use sugar. If you are diabetic use sugar and give yourself a bit more insulin. From what I know there is not much on the market other than what was suggested. Plus how bad could one teaspoon of splenda be per day? I get the "no chemical" thing really....but maybe focus that on something else? or just drink it black? Not trying to be rude...really......HTH|`|8OqdoIHtaa	You could try Stevia.     There's also a product called "Whey Low". They have one for diabetics, I think its called Whey Low D. Its supposed to be natural.     Personally, I use Splenda half the time and Stevia half the time. If Whey Low becomes available here, I might give it a try.    By the way, if you don't want to drink chemicals, you should stop drinking your favourite coffee, especially the instant type.     Its full of chemicals, including some pretty nasty pesticides, and detergents. They aren't on the label, but they're there.     You might want to cut back drastically or quit, if you are serious about avoiding chemicals.     Don't think I'm serious?     Google "coffee and pesticides"   http://www.coffeehabitat.com/2006/12/pes...    Oh, and I won't even start on the hormones used to get cows to produce more milk!|`|xxq5JAM6aa	This from Wikipedia article on Sucralose(Splenda):    Critics of sucralose often favor natural alternatives, including xylitol, maltitol, thaumatin, isomalt, stevia and siraitia.

You'd best just take your coffee black.
P544Sbmqaa	Well, she needs to talk to the docs about this.  If she is donating actual marrow, they will take all they can at one time during a surgical proceedure.  It is an actual surgical proceedure though, done under general anesthesia, so she will be admitted.    If she is donating peripheral blood stem cells, it is an out patient proceedure, but may have to be done more than once, and they will only do it once per day.  So it may be a couple of days.      When you find out which type of cell will actually be donated, you will be able to estimate it better.      You will get more information after they determine that she is in fact a match and in good enough health to donate.  She will be given all the info she needs, she will know which type of donation it is, and she will know how long she will need to plan on being away.    It may also be possible to do the donation locally if there is a facility near you that can/will do it.  That is something you will want to ask the docs about if she is in fact a match.

AA11388527	It's not always clear what has caused appendicitis.  The appendix can become blocked by stool or some foreign object, an accumulation of bacteria or even because of an infection elsewhere in the body.  The appendix can swell in response to any infection.  Another possible explanation has to do with a proposed purpose for the appendix.      From a press release given by William Parker, PhD, assistant professor of experimental surgery at Duke University Medical Center:    Researchers deduce that the appendix is designed to protect good bacteria in the gut.    That way, when the gut is affected by a bout of diarrhea or other illness that cleans out the intestines, the good bacteria in the appendix can repopulate the digestive system and keep you healthy.    But in a modern society less of these good bacteria are needed due to better hygiene practices, which may explain why the appendix has gained a reputation as a useless organ.    "Once the bowel contents have left the body, the good bacteria hidden away in the appendix can emerge and repopulate the lining of the intestine before more harmful bacteria can take up residence," says Parker. "In industrialized societies with modern medical care and sanitation practices, the maintenance of a reserve of beneficial bacteria may not be necessary. This is consistent with the observation that removing the appendix in modern societies has no discernable negative effects."    In addition, according to the hygiene hypothesis, the lack of germs in modern society may cause the immune system to overreact and attack the good bacteria stored away in the appendix.    "This over-reactive immune system may lead to the inflammation associated with appendicitis and could lead to the obstruction of the intestines that causes acute appendicitis," Parker says. "Thus, our modern health care and sanitation practices may account not only for the lack of a need for an appendix in our society, but also for much of the problems caused by the appendix in our society."        As far as excised organs, you can ask but don't expect to get.

316768eecff141a24b121dba4d774d18aa	yeah sumtimes....becuase its not regular yet...............................about 5-6 days though    and yes...sometime sill have it around the 1st then the 20th or so      and dont be self conscious im sure they cant see it...........|`|khxs0ZjPaa	I have a pretty light period, exactly 7 days, more than a month (usually almost two) apart.|`|GuOJIftAaa	Lasts for 5 or 6 days. Once a month but Februarys I have gotten it twice because there's less days. At the beginning and end. And if you're worried about people noticing, why don't you try tampons?|`|DqzhHZnoaa	4 to 5 days;  no pattern    that happened to me ... twice. but it was weird because the two months before that happened, i didnt get it at all. [and i wasnt pregnant] but it was a couple months after i first got it, so it was really irregular    i dont think they can notice it. i never have anyways, and the girls in my PE class where really tight shorts sometimes while theyre on their period. dont worry :)|`|vfrYYjusaa	5-7 days once a month|`|bVJ0B7tXaa	well, one time mine lasted 9 days.|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	Mine is 5-7 days.  I get that feeling that people are watching me or know I have kotex on too. I usually always wear stretch jeans sweatpants when I'm on mine so people can't really tell as much.|`|st2zmU88aa	once a month  5-6 days.|`|83GG2y8gaa	once a day.  5-6 days.  ^_^
Gznvci2baa	Why would you be?  don't take it unless prescribed by your doctor, and if your doctor did prescribe it,then ask him/her.|`|flKkoiwbaa	Men take estrogen when they are interested in becoming a woman, so I'd say it can lead to some "permanent" type effects.  Your skin becomes softer, your facial hair thins, and you stop getting erections.    If the doctor who prescribed the estrogen for you didn't tell you this, then he or she is an idiot.  If you are, for whatever reason, taking estrogen without a prescription . . . well, I guess we all know who the idiot is in that scenario.
yev2iWgWaa	dear verna if it increases in size you must see a doctor if it becomes reddish inflamed you must take antibiotics.if you feel it is hard you must see doctor otherwise do not worry you say pus why do not go and get it drained once pus  is drained it will become normaldon'tt worry get well soon  drg,janaki|`|r5oL56xCaa	leave it awhile for now, wait about 2 weeks or something, maybe even longer, but if it begins to start hurting at all, then immedietely go visit the doctor    adn good luck to you|`|CBfGXLvKaa	I would see a Dr|`|etLfz702aa	It might be an ingrown hair.  If that's what it is, you need to pop it, or have someone else pop it. It might also be an STD if you're having unprotected sex.|`|SJM1f87Waa	this is from shaving...just an ingrown hair. sit in a nice hot bath for about 30 minutes and the swelling/boil should go away in about 2 days. it may look like a boil but it's actually a big pimple. hope this helps!|`|7fGG81bfaa	i had 2 of those at once. one on my right and left side. i just popped them
9da334de0d8258350046544850e0fa57aa	Boils can occur anywhere on your body its an infectious type thingy, really nasty. The most important thing is to keep it clean and dont pop it the pus that comes out is very contagious and if that pus touches anywhere else on your body another boil will pop up. If the pus gets on sheets and other stuff you touch later on...another boil will pop up, and when you pop it it can get infected. so you get the point...dont pop it.      A real good remedy sounds crazy but works: mix gumbo file' with a bit of water till it gets pasty, put a nice amount on a gauze or wrap and lay it on the boil as you sleep. something in the file' dries it up. shoud shrink by the morning, if not do the same thing the next night. during the day wear light and loose cotton panties(breathable) and clean it often.hope that helped.....dang i sure did type alot....srry|`|yev2iWgWaa	if small boil apply antibiotic cream say gentamycin or erytromycin 2 days apply if no change change antibiotic you will get well  god bless|`|vlkbXnXaaa	see your gyno asap. its probably an stp so dont worry about it, you just need to get medicine as soon as you can|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is either an ingrown hair from shaving or a stopped up gland, which we have many of down there.  You need to not squeeze it or you can spread the infection.  Several times a day put warm, wet wash cloths on it for a minute or so, put some peroxide on with a q-tip and some neosporin.  Leave it alone and when it hurts so bad you can't stand it, it will come open on its own.  Sometimes at this point, you can sit in a warm bath and they will open.  Let is drain as much as it will and you can push out the infection when it comes open.  If you can see a hair inside, try to get it out with tweezers, but there may not be one.    hope this helps..|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Yikes.  See a gyno, and soon!|`|N8AJnAbuaa	Its called genital warts duhhh go to the doctor if u go quick enogh ur reproductive organs will be saved|`|Qr7EiDo8aa	no its just an irritates pus filled pimple. pop it and put some warm water on it and you will be fine. I still shave and get them here and there its just from the hair not growing out properly so it will create a boil type pimple. hope i helped|`|83GG2y8gaa	WASH YOUR HANDS FIRST BEFORE DOING THIS!!!!    pop it. it will get all the puss out of it.   lay a warm washcloth on it.  and wear clean underwear(HOPE SO!)  and you should be fine:)|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I have never heard of a boil being "infectious".  I've had a few over the years---usually a year or more apart, so I can't imagine that "infectious" applies.    Most of them will pop on their own---but they can be messy.  Use warm damp cloths on them to help it along when you're home.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	go to the doctor to make sure it isn't something serious but you could have vaginal acne..that's possible|`|rwXM6s50aa	STOP. DROP. GO SEE THE GYNO. LOL.    YES! Go see your gyno. My mom's friend's son (he's 6 months) just found a boil on his rectum and he had surgery to get it removed.  Make a visit with your gyno ASAP!!!!!!|`|7STihXONaa	i have one outside of mine and its just starting to get smaller...i looked them up online and it said to put heat on it so ive been doin tht in my free time and when i got to sleep(with a heating pad)..    the heat is suppose to gather your blood to tht area and help fight the infection a little quicker....while you do this it will eventually pop and start to ooze puss...which is gd..because it needs to be cleaned out..    its been working for me so far so i hope i helped you|`|it596zIpaa	It could be an ingrown hair rather than a boil. A boil would be very large and painful and if this is the case you should see a doctor straight away.    If it is only small like the size of this "O" or a bit bigger you can try lancing it with a needle and then try to find the end of the hair follicle and gently prize it out so that it grows out rather than in. Use some antiseptic cream.|`|bc5ed6323d790f88be7de8afaff7d20caa	To put it simply..Its from shaving,I shave all the time and got them,I just hate being hairy down there.try waxing|`|UIpobEThaa	I have had one for over 5 yrs, it comes and goes. My Dr. does not want to lance it. Antibiotics help dry it up for a while.
dIZNGzneaa	lmao work out i guess|`|4hr9JGAdaa	ew...why on earth would you want to make your veins pop up more..? unless your friends are real skinny then ew.
b9MbC3Uraa	No, that's perfectly normal. One of my best friend hailey or "hyper" hailey is the same way. In fact she purposely tries to stay jacked up on Mountain dew and energy drinks so she won't have an outburst. Her parents have switched her pills twice but that just made her depressed in the mean time. They've tried to get her off of caffeine but then she is she's not herself. I absolutely love her! However , that might not be the best for you. Just don't drink any caffeine at all.|`|16NYiltUaa	well, i would talk to a doctor about your situation. maybe he could help you and prescribe something else. but for now, keep taking your meds, because it's not good to stop without a doctors consent.|`|A6fghDn9aa	when starting a new medication it may take awhile to work correctly keep tacking it and talk to your doctor when he gets back or you can talk to you family doc and take his/her advice|`|vJxuWyueaa	Talk to your doctor who prescribed you the medicine about your problem. Sometimes, medicines do the oposite of what they are supposed to do, so it may take a while until you find the right one.|`|LlyDsHxgaa	It is actually normal to feel like that. You are just getting used to the medicine...You should not feel like that for more than one week...if you do you may need to contact your psychiatrist!|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Abilify can cause an aggrivation of your symptoms, and possibly a worsening of the condition.      There are several drugs to treat this condition.  Unfortunately no one knows which one will be effective in any one patient.    It will be necessary to find one which works for you.  Since you just started taking it, there should be no adverse effects from a sudden withdrawal from this medication.  That, however, must be your decision, and not one made by anyone who answers your question.
ZA18KoC9aa	yes- that's why you should only use them when you need to- if you are nearsighted use them to see distant things and take them off when you are doing near work like reading if you want to avoid eyestrain which can make your eyes worst.|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	I've worn glasses most of my life and have found the only reason my eyes gets worse is my age increases.|`|lm0nlP04aa	No they don't make your eyes worse.  The strain on your eyes when you don't wear them can make your eyes worse.  Your eyes are going to change no matter what whether it is from heredity, etc.  My prescription changed for years and then finally leveled off.  That is just the way it goes for some people.  Then when you get to be a certain age the cornea changes shape and your vision can actually improve.|`|AA10863415	They don't make your eyes worse, they're suppose to help your eyesight. IF you get a script too strong or wear a pair you found, then they might. You should wear a pair made for your eyes, dont wear somebody else's, that's not good on the eyes.|`|wRKhAWXNaa	never let your doctor give you glasses your better off without them ive been wearing them for 9 years theyre just starting to get a little better
s0XxPDHbaa	It sounds 100% normal. If these cramps are a bit below your bellybutton area, its totally your period. good luck sweetheart : )|`|tjhOH6igaa	period !|`|4RpUP4teaa	I am almost 100% sure you are getting your period. The first few times can have very small amounts of blood, and what you described sounds like cramps. Make sure you buy some pads or tampons to keep with you so you'll be prepared for a time when there will be more blood.|`|pkS7I3soaa	Young lady! Why are you telling this to the World? Why not talk to your mom? Or if you don't live with her some female close to you....but yes I think it's PMS. but just....keep your body stuff to yourself at your age, 13 is the age those creppy old men LOVE|`|YRvVLqZ3aa	its definitely your period sweetie. excersising makes cramps go away for some people, and a sick sort of blah feeling in the bottom of your stomach is period pains for sure. welcome to womanhood, and buy yourself a nice supply of pads and/or tampons. (if you are just starting i reccomend pads however)     =D|`|H8f98z48aa	your about to start your period.
ec6qXmaeaa	hello there,  The quick old fashion way is to get a teaspoon of white sugar then about 3 drops of eucalyptus oil and place it on your tongue and swallow it you might have  a after taste so drink it down with water or a lollies after it's down your throat or instead of the sugar put water (mainly hot) it really works unlike cough lollies which are rough and do more damage they are just a rough lollies to me!|`|b85b1d404ec18c8134c1bf7b53170ed2aa	this sounds gross I know, but it REALLY works, gargle with hot salt water for as long as you can stand.|`|eGIWO78zaa	gargle salt water.|`|cLSdkHZOaa	mix honey and vinegar together. have a jar of pickles? eat pickles or gargle or drink pickle juice. or lemons. but i promise the pickles really help me! and drink lots and lots of water. water is the best thing to drink! good luck!|`|N7SJgwm2aa	use nyquil  is the best for sore throat and cough and fever the best trust me use the green bottle , good luck get well soon|`|3oJL2Go3aa	Gargle salt water or what I do to prevent from getting strep throat is to drink hot tea or coffee. Anything hot will work. I know it sounds silly but it works. Good Luck and hope you get to feeling better.
lmgbsbwbaa	Its an ulser!!! Stop Eating Fruit that has acid in it!!!|`|LSXosyX3aa	I think it is a cold sore. Since its white and it hurts. You could use some things but I forgot what the names are. Maybe check with other answers.  You'll get more support|`|Hc0vjK5laa	Just saw an article on TV......get it checked by a pro....|`|kY9fVBbLaa	I get stuff like that all the time.. My parents tell me todrink salted water ( which hurts like hell ) but after around.. 2, 3 days it should be gone.    if not, get it checked ( of corse.)
ZmYTngnFaa	It depends, if you slow run/fast jog/pace yourself or whatever you want to call it. Your body learns quickly, so after a week I would run more at the same pace, or the same length at a fast pace. It's great that you already see results, but a healthy diet is important too, and water, not juice, or gatorade.  In about 2-3 more weeks you should see a bigger difference|`|NCvX4I0baa	It depends on how hard you're running and whether it's at your pace or not. If you start to get use to 2-4 miles than you gotta challenge yourself. In about 3 weeks you'll see pretty big results if you're strict and consistent with this.    Your stomach should be more toned as well as your thighs.|`|fv1z84Emaa	3 weeks! The key is don't stop. The lbs will melt away. Make sure you eating the right foods.. And enough calories your body needs.  After starting out slow 1/2 mile a night ... 5 months later, I am running 3 miles 5 days a week ,, I have lost 40 lbs and 6 dress sizes.
asX2hxFXaa	Sounds like it could be trapped gas bubbles...nothing serious.  One way to know for sure, when you feel that, stretch or whatever in a way that makes it worse (to apply pressure).  If it gets worse and then suddenly goes away, that's symptomatic of a gas bubbles.    They get in between tissue walls and muscle and feel like a knife stabbing you.  Breathe deep or stretch to push them, and it goes away.|`|AiLcSxcBaa	Chest pain means heart attack.  You need to see a doctor.|`|l9pserEfaa	I have pains in my side sometimes too. I am a pretty healthy person and exercise often. I was told that mine are muscle spasms. They are caused from stress.|`|9LGInLsYaa	I get these too... but im a bit younger and its more regular like a few times a week.. I'm VERY athletic soo.. i dont know..  I wish i knew too~~|`|ZzPoNvo2aa	It could be gas, indigestion or stress. It depends on what you are eating or whats going on in your life.|`|KT0UTX8taa	Dont worry you are probably under a lot of stress!!! Relax, dont be afraid, stress is the mother to all illnesses...  I think It s probably just a muscle cramp, I have experienced a similar sensation before, especially when I was under stress or worried aabout something, or when I was afraid....
AA10047640	Yes it is, but it's also one of the most misunderstood illnesses of it's kind. It is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain that affects a person's mental capacity while it is actually a physical problem. Often you'll find several members of a family with bipolar disorders all to different degrees, it is passed on from generation to generation. Thankfully each year sees new medications to help control the imbalance.|`|JBj3B5y0aa	yes it is|`|O0ZAi9RRaa	It can be, but shouldn't be isolated to only genetics. You can become bi-polar due to life's dramas, also, but the majority of patients seem to have a parent or family member who has bi-polar disorders.    Mental health is such a gray area. There is nothing even close to just black and white.|`|odbFjCTlaa	Yes it can be genetic but that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't have it and there be no family history of it  and vice versa.|`|APN67ZUqaa	yes it is, and if it skips a generation then the following generation chances of getting it increase. For example, if you parent had it, and you were lucky enough not to, then your children chances will highly increase.|`|BhYDTUrWaa	no it is not|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Yes.  However, that does not mean a child will inherit it from their parents.  The odds will be greater if both parents have the disorder.|`|QwKiK85eaa	Yes I have it so does alot of my family members|`|RN0zRPH4aa	unfortunately yes|`|k3LbhASGaa	no , it is one of the most miss diagnosed mental disorder ever|`|vJxuWyueaa	It is not certain, but scientists believe that it is genetic and can be passed down through generations, and same with other mental disorders.
wtg8vtzBaa	If you started an antibiotic today, you should be feeling better tomorrow.  I know it's common to get UTI's while pregnant so be on the lookout for symptoms.
UZxeBrxQaa	That scar tissue doesn't care which side you carry to.    There is no cure for this condition.  Surgery can easily cause more problems than you already have.  As long as you are functional, you will probably just have to live with the disorder.  It may get worse.    The last alternative are surgical implants, of which a number of types are available.
UIoGLaKpaa	Yes I know exactly what you are talking about--- I can remember the stupidest detail from 5 years ago but cannot remember what I ate for breakfast.|`|6jXuUCdraa	yes, i have both: short term and long term memory loss. EXPECIALY long term. i cant remeber anything from my past..well, exept bad things that i focuse too much on. sorry, sorry! rambling here. but yeah, i do. i have to write little memors on my hands, like: get milk or do homework. haha|`|HKHCuRI8aa	not the best never been very good.|`|8TVYDSB5aa	Yeah I always go upstairs to get something and forget what I went up there for.
MoyvVnBZaa	Just eat healthy and exercise. Limit junk food and eat lots of whole grains, lean protein, fruits, veggies, etc. To burn fat, do cardio - walking, jogging, biking, swimming, dancing. Do 30-45 minutes about 4 or 5 times a week. And you know what's also really great? Wii Fit! Definitely buy it if you have a Wii.|`|QajuWPzxaa	i have the same problem as you! what i do after the holidays and to loosen off a little weight and tighten up your tummy and thighs, is i have two 10 pound hand weights.. and i dance to a type of upbeat song. the moves i do involve crunching my lower Abs and strengthening my thighs. i also watch what i eat and do a little exercise! i weigh 120 and am 5'5, and i try to stay in the 110-115 range!! hope all goes well!!!|`|6ucVuo10aa	u dont need to lose any weight ure just fine in my book|`|vM2gUcgLaa	exercise is only way to loose healthy weight i see so many girls starving themeselves because they are to lazy to exercise and just want to text all do get a yoga video and mat and go to town|`|m9MA5evmaa	your weight is normal..possibly underweight|`|ArkfFTuLaa	Okay, so those free trial things look like a pretty easy solution to your problem, right? Well they're not! They tell you a free trial for like 5 bucks, but then what they dont tell you is every 31 days after you order they want to charge you 90$!!!!! I tried the Acai Berry one, and i had to cancel my order for the months after right away. But if you do that then i guess it solves your problem. I'm just giving you a heads up.  If you really feel like you want to loose weight, i suggest joining weight watchers. I'm a member myself and i'm 14 too. They send you to the docter, and the docter gives you a goal weight, then weight watchers helps you loose it but still lets you eat whatever you want. I love it.  Good luck hun!
eC0GNU0Uaa	Being too humble as some can call the personality in you can create that reaction. Try being more empowered about yourself and think "casual" of it, as if some one (example, mother) is calling on you instead of the teacher.|`|OrkEPyEvaa	I think its cute. Dont stop :] lol
215e8f63a273a9d5cbab203c741c8cecaa	Don't lube up with soap.  The wax in soap clogs the pores of your skin and before you know it you have zits on your penis.  There are some nice masturbation creams out there such as these http://www.cheaplubes.com/index.asp?Page... but you can also use ordinary hand lotion.  Just don't use soap of any kind.|`|i6RlYFo7aa	allergic to the soap you're using?    you shouldn't be using soap on your penis anyway, you wash your penis with warm water    or are they fosrdyces spots or pearly penile papules? those are normal|`|cr2KKT6Naa	you may want to show a doc. not mom or dad.|`|VILBKcZMaa	use lotion, that's more reaction. (no homo)|`|vJxuWyueaa	Those bumps are normal. They are just birthmarks.|`|RRucp8rzaa	Something like this occurred to my friend.... he had a rash though but for you i suggest just stop using the soap and use lotion or something it will be clear if your circumcised because they are cleaner then uncircumcised penises.|`|qlvGJ3Ndaa	stop using the soap. the soap plus the rubbing of the masturbation probably leaves you with dry skin. causing the itching and bumps|`|nXPbiw4Naa	I don't think it is really anything bad but my friend has bumps on his penis and my penis is really icky sometimes. So i don't think it's anything serious. Try stop using soap.|`|jewTWB5Waa	soap irritates the skin of the penis, you're best simply rubbing it in the shower clean.  i don't think its anything serious, and probably not herpes if that's what your thinking.|`|eDjdCw48aa	Use Lotion or Baby Oil Jergens aka Jerkens :) its iight dawg weve all expiremented on different things lol.|`|YjuVJbxSaa	just cut the bumps off
EIaVSdPLaa	Hey Ricky,  To get your LDL down i first up recommend changes to your lifestyle rather than medication. Polyunsaturated fat in foods is one of the best ways to start. Fish, Hazel nuts, Walnuts and Brazil nuts as well as certain margarine and oil are all good for starting with a lifestyle change, eating fish two or three times a week is very good for your health. Avoid products like pies, pastries, biscuits, cakes and full cream dairy products. Also start exercising regularly and sort out a fitness plan for the next six weeks and revise it after that. If this doesn't seem to be working then you should consult your doctor and start on some easier medication such as fibrates or ezetimibe.     At the moment it sounds like your doing fine with the cholesterol as HDL is indeed good.    Good luck,  Donna|`|AA12348388	HDL is good, yes.    exercise and loose weight  eat more food high in soluble fibres - like oats  and take omega-3 supplements
rBPR3HuXaa	BREAST REDUCTION?! THATS LIKE SLAPPING GOD IN THE FACE FOR LOVING YOU|`|nOmuccPnaa	I agree. Unfortunately people will always stare if there is something to stare at. If it is causing you physical pain, and I sure believe it is, you should talk to your parents. When I was in high school a best friend and another girl in one of my classes had breast reductions. One of the girls felt and even looked better! Talk to your parents and go see a doctor about it. I would think if you went down to a C you would feel much better.|`|ENJ0bY48aa	If large boobs are causing you physical back pain, I would look into breast reduction surgery.  It can cause life long back problems.  Talk to your parents and see if they will at least take you into a consultation with a plastic surgeon.|`|eJDoIk0maa	you could try breast reduction surgery, but you're young so your age might be an issue (i'm not an expert by any means but some doctors may not be willing to do the procedure on someone under 18)     also, if money is an issue-most insurance companies will cover it if the doctor says it's hurting your back|`|pi3GbgpFaa	You can't really do anything about it, unless you have breast reduction.    And boys will be boys.|`|oY9wTOdUaa	msspupp is right...u are only 15 and if they are causing u physical and emotional pain, i would talk to your parent and see about going to a specialist to have them reduced... good luck and remember you are beautiful no matter what|`|8Q1MGgBRaa	thats wierd about the math teacher.................... your back pain should go away after a while|`|pkS7I3soaa	You weigh 105 pounds with your D boobs? Do you fall over face first?!  I would gain some weight if I were you....just to balence everything else.
IYgTS1eiaa	Ok, tell ur close friends. like dont tell all of them. but the ones you trust the most.    and i no this is offtipic but did u see that counseler yet? talking to him/her will help and u wont need to tell your friends. but i would tell your closest friends|`|eS9nPWqBaa	What are you depressed about, mortgage, debt, lost your job? problems with spousal abuse? divorce?     I'm not saying you can't be depressed but seriously someone once told me., that there are kids all over the world who's being sold at the age of 5 for prostitution and kids who have no idea what food or CLEAN water taste like - so even though its EXTREMELY hard try and find things to be happy about - even if its fresh air.    I'm not preaching to you sweetheart - I feel your pain, but maybe you should try your best to think of how this is going to affect your life.    XOXOXO|`|Z92cIMaEaa	Forget telling your friends...tell a psychiatrist.|`|qHCtBq07aa	Well its how you think you're friends will perceive the situation.   Some might tell you its fine and be like whatever and not even care.   Some might become worried, flip out and rat you to a teacher/adult whomever, and if you haven't already told an adult and are in therapy, then the situation will become even messier and you will have more people than your probably wanted knowing.   Or some might take it and be normal, recognize that its a tough time and help you get through it.   Its you're decisionn but remember every decision has strings attached.|`|Y51w7dNUaa	no tell your parents first i told my friend first and i got screamed at and she never spoke to me again :(|`|ULx2vAB1aa	only tell the ones that won't freak out and tell someone. if you want to tell them, be sure that you can trust them. if there is any doubt in your mind that they will tell, don't tell them. it's you choice|`|8TVYDSB5aa	I wouldn't tell all of them, but if you want to tell someone, talk to a friend you trust.|`|eSiCw6n7aa	welll it depends if your friends are like you or not because i have friends that cut themselves and they were perfectly fine and then i had the friends that didnt and they were worried but got over it moral of the story..... if theyre really your friends theyll accept you|`|HKHCuRI8aa	cutting is stupid, what is so bad you aren't even grown up yet and have real problems.Tell or ?|`|5jVNBiw1aa	I agree with the first answer you need to get therapy, my wife went through a period where she cut herself.  She is bipolar and suffers from it every day, but it has helped her to talk to a professional, and yes you should talk to your friends they can help but try to make friends that are not judgmental, maybe go to group counseling and see if you can't relate to anyone there.  Good luck|`|85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	only if you really feel like they should know, and that they are really really trustworthy, and if they love you then they'll try to  accept it. if they aren't trustworthy, then they might freak and tell an adult who will tell your parents etc.   but it probably would be really good to tell just a special friend who you can confide with and, trust me it'll feel so good to get it off your chest and not have to be paranoid around that person. =]
pi3GbgpFaa	Well if you haven't ran lately, start off with a small amount or however much you can handle. Then gradually progress in time and/or distance.|`|hm4rnN7Paa	In order to lose weight, you should run 3 miles a day.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	30-45 minutes of running every other day should do it. More is ok, but for basic conditioning, that's really all you need.
0KaadzHzaa	In this situation you need to take the little guy to the hospital for an x-ray. There really is no way to say that he does or does not have a fracture of the arm otherwise. In fact at this young age it can even sometimes be hard to tell by x-ray if the arm is fractured. This is because the bones of children are still very soft and pliable. He could have something called a "green-stick fracture". It gets the name from how if you take a living "green" tree branch and try to break it, it will bend and splinter instead of just cleanly breaking. Then when you let pressure off the branch it can go back to looking normal. Combine this with the fact that a 1 year old can not talk to you and tell you what is going on, and the need to take the child to be seen at the hospital becomes even more evident. So, yes, I think you should take him!|`|L1z5qydSaa	Indeed go and get that checked as soon as possible. If it is sprained ice it and/or use a wrap for sprains or a sling/splint to prevent injury.

tfTQ6Cuuaa	Dry air lacks moisture, moist air does not. Very humid weather like in Florida is considered moist. Cold winter days up north are considered dry.    To remedy either situation, use a humidifier to add moisture to the air in dry climates and a dehumidifier to remove moisture from the air in humid climates.|`|uAWx5sz0aa	I think that moist air is air that is filled with water molecules and that dry air does not have as much water molecules.

We need to know three definitions: the volume of calories in our food, the volume of calories a certain activity burns every sixty minutes, and finally our own personal daily limit of calories. The one diet which clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I shed thrity pounds, it clearly does produce results!
8OqdoIHtaa	No. The product Splenda markets contains half real brown sugar and half Splenda. Its too high in carbs to use if you have diabetes.    Whey Low has a product but I don't know much about it. I know they have one called Whey Low D which is meant for diabetic use, but the brown sugar substitute they make is probably higher in carbs.    I haven't found a safe alternative yet, so I stick with regular Splenda, and Stevia. If I'm baking, I just add more cinnamon.
5Kt8qlytaa	Stress can cause her to miss her period all together. First, if you are this freaked out about getting her pregnant I don't think it's such a good idea to be having sex, but that's a personal choice. I won't preach on that subject.  Just chill out.  You knows when you are freaking out about it and it makes her more stressed.  So when she stresses it can delay her period or even make her miss her period.  The more she relaxes on the situation the more likely her period is to be normal.  She sould also be on some sort of birth control to help remedy this extra stressing out.  It can protect her if the condom does break, and help regulate her periods.|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	stress can cause it|`|CqldGgFCaa	it could just be late if she has been under a lot of stress lately or lost a lot of weight in a small amount of time    good luck:)    love peace chicken grease:)|`|FECYVcduaa	hey well i have had exactly the same problem as you and my gf got her period so what you two need to do is just calm down and sooner or later it will come|`|e7ozlAsPaa	Is sex really worth being this stressed out over? She would probably benefit being on birth control and use condoms as well. This way her cycles will be regulated and she will be double protected. Stress over obsessing over whether she is pregnant or not can definitely effect her cycle. A home pregnancy test should be accurate if you do a test at least 2 weeks from the last time you had sex.

lDcnabQeaa	I would prefer the rotary blade over the foil shaver. Why? Well:    1. Foil shaver eventually wears down, becuase you're rubbing the blade against the foil, and any hair that gets caught in this screen gets cut. Hence you have to     2. Rotary shaver is more gentle on your skin. You can't really get cut, whereas with a foil razor, if you press hard enough it looks like a dog scratched you.    -3. Foil razors are probably easier to clean, all you do is dump out the whiskers, whereas a rotary requires a small cleaning brush, but it means they have a lower maintainance and hence lower durabilty.    However, today's advances have made both technologies viable options. Pick the one that you're willing to spend the most $ on.
SAUrYW0Daa	Yes, they can also add weights & thera bands to the exercises...& when you tell them when it still hurts, they will come up with exercises to strengthen where your injury was & also how to relax them.  They may do gait retraining also.    Good luck|`|reAtqf0Maa	u need more physical therapy. it will help and they can add more stiff. like the bands and exercises that strengthen the knee|`|W1tx1p2iaa	You may want to see a PT who is experienced and possibly certified in kinesiotaping.

4Gt3ZVqsaa	It really depends on your eating habits and exercise. Although i have to say u are pretty tall for a 14 year old. The weight is fine though.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Nobody can estimate your final height & weight.  You won't finish puberty until at least age 21 & growing can continue until puberty ends.
DmyqvxmJaa	I'm learning too...:) trust me, after a while your mind will stop wandering. I thought mine never would, but after a week my mind was clearer. Just put all your attention on your breathing. I mean all of it, while not controlling it, there's a big difference. You can try focusing on the warmth of your breath your upper lip, or on the air entering and leaving the tip of your nose, too. Visualizing a calming picture helps me on days when i really can't concentrate...I think of being on a swinging hammock, looking up at the sun being filtered through treetops...just keep working, and suddenly one day you'll stop thinking, that's what happened to me. And make sure you're really, really relaxed.  I hope this helps, and good luck! :)|`|ParFJxnSaa	That is the reason why I recommend practicing the EMDR, below, before beginning. Then perhaps the Progressive Muscle Relaxation, then word/phrase (mantra) repetition, or avoid the PMR; use the mantra repetition, then switch to mindfulness breathing. Tire your eyes, and bore your mind for a while, and it will turn inward! The Yoga Nidra has a similar effect.    MEDITATION: Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris You will know, from the ease, and effect, which one suits you best, but try them some hours apart, preferably early, and definitely not late at night, at least, not at first. Prior to using either of the methods in the above paragraph, first sit comfortably, and take a deep breath. Then, without moving your head, move your eyes from the left, to the right, and back again, taking around a second to do so (say: "a thousand and one": this takes approximately a second). Repeat this procedure (without the words, although you can count, subvocally, if you like) 20 times: "A thousand and one; a thousand and two... " and so on, to a thousand and twenty. Then close your eyes and relax. Become aware of any tension or discomfort you feel. Then open your eyes, and take another deep breath, and repeat step one, closing your eyes, and relaxing afterwards, in the same manner. Then, repeat the procedure one last time.    Some people may find that this is all they need do.  With experience, you may find that you can practise this in public, with your eyes closed, which greatly widens the window of opportunity for its use, and avoids attracting unwanted attention. I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is repaid many times over. I also use it prior to my chosen relaxation technique, after lights out, at night. For more about Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, showing recommendations by those who have used it, including a professional psychotherapist with more than 20 years of experience in that field, see sections 33 - 34, at ezy-build. She was skeptical, at first, and I remained unconvinced, until trying it, and now I use it twice daily, including after lights out, at night.    She prefers the progressive muscle relaxation, in section 11, on its own, and it is probably is a good first choice, for you. It will teach you how to still your mind, and enable you to emotionally centre yourself. This exercise is an improvement on the more well-known Empty Your Mind Exercise: WARNING: The empty your mind exercise is often used in various New Age groups but I don't recommend it. Any exercise where we are told to empty our minds is not good because the point of these kinds of exercises is to get us to see we are not our mind by observing our mind long enough so that we can begin to identify with the observer of the mind rather than mind itself. The Empty Your Mind exercise, instead of getting us to identify with the observer of the mind, mistakenly gets us to identify with emptiness. Now if we are suffering from a lot of garbage in our mind which is torturing us, maybe emptiness provides temporary release, but it does not lead to any kind of transcendental understanding.     Release from suffering is not the same thing as release of suffering. If we must do this exercise, let's do it this way. When told to empty our mind, we should empty ourselves of our mind. That works! Sit quietly and imagine your mind as a huge garbage can full of debris-thoughts, images, sounds, colors. Have a garbage truck come by to pick up the can. Throw out the thoughts and images into the truck one by one and when it is almost empty, toss in the can. Now where can your thoughts reside with no mind? When one comes along, just hang it over the clothesline far away, and then let the wind come and blow it further over the hill. Regular daily practice of one of the relaxation techniques will enable you to become a calmer, more self controlled person, who is less influenced by situations, and the behaviour of others.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	The recent news could be troublesome.   In the third section in the Ninth Talk in the Zhuan Falun Lecture on the web, you can read up about thoughts and keeping calm during meditation.  I hope the spirituality in the passage helps you.    Guided meditation demonstration video, meditation music, and books about Falun Gong are free to download from the URL listed below. If you need any help, contact a local practitioner in your area for free instructions. Good luck.    Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.    Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China. The most offensive human right violation is the organ harvesting from the Falun Gong practitioners in China.  http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html|`|hGKZsfg8aa	find a center, one thing to focus on, or just hum and focus on your breath(:  good luck!
O0ZAi9RRaa	It's good that you're happy with them regardless. I'm sure you know women are made up of so much more than breast size. I grew up with very large ones and I hated men being interested in me because of 2 lumps on my chest instead of ME. I ended up having a reduction done recently due to back problems and I feel like a princess now!  With that said, I believe your concerns are merely just that you are different.

Youre going to lift weights two or three times a week, doing big compound lifts, not ******* around on the curl machine. Each workout has a push, a pull, and a squat. Use whatever rep scheme you want, as long as you get 15-25 reps (total, not per set) on each. On days when you dont lift, youre going to get some light exercise to keep your metabolism up and aid recovery.   Youre going to get no less than eight hours of sleep every night.

Have your doctor make a meal plan for you, and follow it. (no cheats)    Any product like this is bound to have serious health affects on someone your age. Likely resulting in gaining a lot of weight.
0uoYK4vHaa	So I had a kidney stone and you would know if it was one..   I was 7 months pregnant at the time.. The day it "moved" I drank a litre of cranberry juice that morning(craving..lol)  I went out of dinner at noonish and was complaining about my side(it kinda felt like I had to pee and my bladder was full but it wasn't )and it progressively got worse through the day..finally I was in so much pain I started to get sick a lot.. I had a ultra sound of my kidney and it was very small. I couldn't even imagine a bigger one..   I never did pass it..(that I know of)  If you do have a stone, I'm sure the cranberry juice will help..(I have never drank it since..)|`|xL6zc0bOaa	Could be urine infection, you need some thing  like trimethoprim or cephalexin, and that will cure your uninary infection.|`|AA10409832	Sounds like you either have a UTI or a stone.  Cranberry juice is not going to get rid of it.  You'll either pass it or you'll have to have it taken out.  If it is a UTI, then call your doctor NOW so he can prescribe something for you. That way, he, and you, can tell more about the symptoms when you go to see him in a week.  Good luck.
tAYXUXreaa	At least you are looking into this. I went in there with no idea of what to expect. When I had mine out I was also asleep. They will not let you leave the doctors office until you are completely conscious. This seems to be a law. You will however walk between rooms and not remember it. Well at least I did not remember it and none of my friends did either. But think of it this way. Your mouth is going to be loaded with cotton and is going to hurt. You won't really be able to talk, so it is not like you are going to be saying something you regret. Your body will also move very slowly, so you are most likely not going to be doing any actions either. Hope this helps! Just make sure you sleep alot. That is the best way to get the pain to go away!|`|Cvp2WRcsaa	When my brother got his pulled, he was asleep too. I know that he didn't really worry too much about it, and apparently when he was about to fall asleep the doctor said to my mom "Well, if there's anything you want to ask him, do it now." And my mom said "Is there anything you want to tell me?" but he just said no. So I think there's still some control (but I'm not implying that my brother's in anything bad). I know that they just asked him to count backwards from one hundred, and he was out. Once they were done, I think they just kind of woke him up. He was really tired afterwards, and obviously kind of sore. He said it wasn't too bad though.|`|177d4a958268cbe2c2f1df1c792a92c4aa	You will be awake before you leave the dentist office.
1oIHYPJHaa	1. Warm up and stretch, not doing so will cause injury. Here are some stretches you can try:            * Lunges            * Butterfly            * Half split one leg and stretch forward            * Leg rotations and levies     2. Stretch yourself. Do lunges, butterflies, touch your toes etc. Make sure your legs are stretched and so is your back. Sit with your legs apart on the floor and put your head down. Then try to put it on your left/right leg. This may be difficult.     3. Go into position. This will either be straddle, left or right.     4. After you have warmed up for at least 10 minutes, get into the split or straddle position and go down as far as you can without any major pain or discomfort. Slowly lower yourself down as far as you can go. Don't over do it. This means if you can only go down to be a foot off the ground while feeling a decent stretch, don't go farther.     5. Stay in that position for about 30 seconds then get up stretch and repeat, not too many times or you could cause an injury. Only do it until you feel like you can't anymore or you are going to hurt yourself.     6. Make sure when you are done to repeat your warm up stretches, this is an absolute must!     7. Do not go over your limits and go down too far and you feel major pain. This is an over time process and you will get better as you do this everyday.              * Make sure your toes are pointed.      * If you can't go down very far put one hand on each side to hold your self up.      * To get an even better stretch for your left and right, try to put your head on your leg or lean back and try to look at the wall.      * Stay in a clear area where you won't get stepped on.      * Make sure that your knee stays tucked in and does not face out to the side.      * Wear flexible, comfy, clothing.|`|2VMwLAbQaa	do a split and hold it, and stretch.|`|cB9tpUHmaa	do it slow|`|nVfN8usNaa	Stretch excercises...?  I have no clue.|`|VXyGwhdvaa	just do splits as far as you can and hold them as long as you can. practice makes perfect. they'll be ugly at first but they'll get better and better. do straddle sits and butterflies- STRADDLE SITS A LOT! then just do stretches that you can feel right below your groin, and keep working. every single morning and every single night.|`|cLSdkHZOaa	stretch alot, especially your legs, every day and then after you stretch do the splits and practice this every day.
S71MT9USaa	Every other day - six days a week (alternate exercises). The soreness is only going to be there if you are first starting to exercise and/or if you slack off so have to begin again. Do stretching exercises before and after lifting.|`|F5R3TJEQaa	When it's no longer sore.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	kinda sore|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Work every muscle group every other or every 2 days, letting your muscles rest decreases your chances of getting hurt. Also, sore is fine, it means you're changing your body, pain is a different story altogether.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    When you put stress on the body, it will change.   I am guessing that you are building muscle with out cardio, so make sure you are doing deep stretches.   Stretching will help your muscles recover faster.|`|gyoylefvaa	you should  do every other days.    you should be fine to re-workout what you did last time.|`|jhOxhnEuaa	Ok, i know this lol.. my gym teacher taught us.. you have to wait 2 days.. so for example.. you work on your upper body one day.. then next day work on your lower body.. then after your upper body would've gotten some time to relax.. so after 2 days you can work on your upper body again.. but you need at least 2 days i say.. do not risk.. because while sleeping your muscles, i would say manufacture.. they rebuild again to get a little bit bigger.. it's like a command your body gives every time you work out.. so wait 2 days and you'll be fine.|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	2 days after you should be fine to reworkout what you did last time.|`|BkZbgJ9Iaa	kiknda|`|SlkKa1jsaa	dont pay attention to how it feels,and just do your normal routine...|`|4Gt3ZVqsaa	First of all dont workout until its at that point.  For an easy-medium weight do 3 sets of 10-15 reps.  You should be doing that much.|`|MDzPFiUCaa	Sometimes i will workout certain muscle groups, and it'll be incredibly sore for about 3 days, when is it safe to start working it out again? When it's no longer sore, or when it's only kinda sore?|`|9fLLn2PFaa	You can still work it out when it;s sore but give it at least 24-36 hours before you lift again.  If you don;t give your muscle enough rest it will never grow.  It will be in a constant state of breaking down.  That's how your muscles grow.  when you work out you cause tiny tears in the tissue and when you rest your muscle bridges the gaps cause by the tears.|`|AA11578107	It all depends on how hard you're working it.  If it's a routine work out I'd say give yourself at least a day for your ripped muscles to rebuild themselves.  If it's a really rigorous workout, then at least a day.  If you continue to work something too much then you my hyper - extend your muscles and you'll be out of commission for a while.|`|jtK3pgwiaa	Depends on what muscle. Abs are usually 1-2 days, others vary. When it feels good, workout again.|`|qZpcgXgDaa	If you let your arms rest you can workout alot more if they do not get tired, that is what i do.|`|zhNpB1uuaa	golds gym|`|VAtJMwNuaa	A good amount of exercise is when you stop before the muscle starts to feel sore. Anyway, it is probably safer to wait until the muscle is almost completely sore less before you exercise again. Muscle sores are a natural reaction when you start a new training program. Your muscle is trying to adapt. Soon enough, you will no longer feel sores.|`|496babd9168b78c6f24aaf5a21f9133caa	You really should be okay to work out the next day to. The best way to lose weight and or gain muscle is doing intense exercises/workout and then having a little cooling down period. Like if you worked out INTENSELY for 20 minutes then you should rest for 5 minutes and then start again. Good luck. O yuh and if it doesn't like hurt you and it's very easy for you to do whatever your doing then your probably not doing anything for your muscles you need to feel the resistance and pain but not too much it shouldn't be feeling like nothing if it does you need to make the intensity level higher.  Good Luck :)
CTOd9HCmaa	You will be better off talking to a specialist (your doctor). I wouldn't trust just someone you don't know anything about who talks on Yahoo Answers. :-) Good Luck brother!
EYmgAUgaaa	Yea you're going to have to give more information.  It sounded like you initially had a subungual hematoma (blood under nail), which they punctured through the nail to release the blood.  Paper clip and lighter, although innovative, sound ok to me, because the puncturing is just through dead nail cells.  It's next to impossible to puncture through the nail bed and into your bone?!  That part sounds fishy to me.    Edit:  I've personally never heard of that complication before.  Nevertheless, there's nothing you can really do to unwind what happened.  If you decide to sue, your lawyer basically has to find a doctor that is willing to testify that whatever they did to you caused your injury as you claim it.  I doubt that will be easy.  That's only considering a lawyer even takes your case.  Your most likely scenario is to either "forget it" or continue battling it out with the school system.|`|aU91Xgrraa	SUE!!!! By the way your school should understand.|`|AA12348388	you should probably sue them, since it would be unfair that you would have to bear the cost of hospital treatment and mri  they're covered by insurance in case things like this happen, so their insurance company will settle the payment for you

15cgH4JLaa	I've tried many of "diets" throughout the years- including a low carbohydrate one. Depending on how strict you want to be, the average of carbohydrate intake may vary. I've done diets where the count was as low as ten grams of carbohydrates, and I've also done diets where I only ate protein, vegetables, and fruit (but no processed food or bread/starches), and that one worked best for me.     A typical day in the "Induction phase" of the Atkins Diet, consist of 20 grams of carbohydrates. This is equivalent to about 4 cups of vegetables.      I lost a lot of weight fairly quickly eating egg whites, protein shakes, vegetables, chicken, sushi, fish, turkey, salad greens, fat free yogurt and lots and lots of fruit! If you'd like, you could incorporate some fat free cheese and brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and/or sweet potatoes once in a while too. And I also recommend designating several days throughout the year (like on holidays) or one day each month where you can eat whatever you want. This helps keep you sane and also determined.     No matter what, drink plenty of water. I would suggest doing a "diet" that you will enjoy. If you enjoy meats, than a low carbohydrate plan is right for you. For quick weight loss, this is the extreme. If you could stick with it for a lifetime- than good for you, you've found your plan!     Good luck!|`|9XmJPjXvaa	I have tried low carb diet. works a while and back to square one.     read the article about low carb diet here http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/2...|`|XxR36ICHaa	My mom is currently on this, she has alot of sucess with it, and can usually loose a couple pant sizes in the first 3 weeks or so. The biggest problem is that she can't just do it forever, she at some time or another has to go off the diet. The diet is draining for energy, she eats about 10 carbs per day. You can't work out when you're on the diet, because you don't have the drive. The second day is the hardest, and it gets easier after that, but you'll have days where you crave carbs the whole day long. If you NEED to cheat, eat a about a one inch square peice of dark (high coca percent) chocolate (it has about 3 carbs)  It's hard to find something to eat sometimes, especailly if you're in town.  The diet isn't easy by all means, but it works.  I would only really do it if there was something specail that you had to loose the weight for. For most people it's not a permemant soloution.  Also if you have issues with blood sugar, it is extreemly dangerous, also if you have any heart troubles, it may add to the stress on your heart.  My doctor does not think that this diet is a good idea, however for some people it is healthier to take the wait off, than to keep gaining it.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Yes, I lost 120 on Atkins.  You start with 20 carbs and go up until you find your set point (get the book).  Main thing I learned is stay away from the cheese and you have to eat mostly vegetables.  That is where people go wrong with it.. just eating hamburger and cheese all the time.  But if you do it according to directions it really works.|`|rp372bcYaa	ive lost weight on there. but u have to follow the directions just like the guy before me said.    But be careful, once you get off the diet, its very easy to gain all the weight right back.

Some basic tips:  Breakfast:  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great.   Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it.   Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner. Definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.

8xQ5bzFCaa	yes all youre teeth are going to fall out. what a waste of such a nice smile :(|`|ENJ0bY48aa	Smoking creates negative pressure in your mouth which can remove the blood clot forming where your wisdom teeth once were.  If the blood clot does indeed get removed, you will get a dry socket.  It has nothing to do with cleaning in.  There isn't much you can do besides avoid negative pressure (smoking, using a straw, etc).  Also, don't stick anything back there to try to clean it.  After a few days, try gently swishing water around in your mouth.    I would wait a solid week before using a straw or smoking.  The risk of a dry socket is too high and it is beyond painful and makes your recovery a lot longer.  After a week, you can begin using a syringe to gently squirt water back into the holes to clean them after eating.  You can also resume smoking after about a week.  It takes 5-7 days for the risk of a dry socket to pass.    Your teeth aren't going to fall out from smoking.  You are at risk for a dry socket and I would HIGHLY recommend not smoking for a week after the surgery to avoid the pain and hassle of a dry socket.|`|37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	The biggest problem with you smoking that one cig is dry socket.  As far as cleaning it I would just rinse your mouth with some salt water.  Don't try to rinse the socket especially just rinse it out.     NO all your teeth wont fall out though.  As far as smoking?  Do you have your tooth packed still?   If so, keep it that way and change to packing after you smoke.  Of course you should call your dentist for any specific questions and if you have any problems.|`|BnPe68lmaa	DO NOT SMOKE!!!! YOU COULD DIE....HERE THIS IS A WEBSITE THAT YOU SHOULD GO ON :http://smoke51.com/  GOO ON THAT WEBSITEE OKAYYY.....AND U SHOULD NEVER SMOKE OKAY BUT IF U REALLY WANT TO RICK UR LIFE START AT 60 DONT START YOUNG OKAY.....EVERY CIGERRESTE THAT YOU SMOKE IT TAKES 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM UR LIFE AND THAT IS REAL OKAY LISTEN TO MEE OKKK|`|YjFDfp5Paa	I smoked the day after I got my teeth pulled.  If need be make a mixture of warm water and salt and gargle with that.  Make sure to put a bag of frozen peas on your face, it greatly reduces the swelling.

34tNnzQ7aa	Not only pressure, but oil would cause acne as well as your skin not being able to air out/breathe (you know what I mean).    Try finding a more comfortable position or sleep with your blanket between your hand and face|`|hA6JDWsFaa	Yes. I would try to avoid sleeping on your arm or hands. But if you must, wash them before you fall asleep, along with your face. And always remember to wash or change your bed sheets and pillow sheets, sometimes the dirt you leave on your bed stays in the cloth and causes you to break out at night. All in all, just make sure your bed and arms are clean before you go to sleep. Hope this helps!|`|LD7ifwvXaa	Pressure, no. but The oil and germs on your hand (and trust me, there's a LOT) could definitely make you break out.  Try sleeping with your hand Under your pillow instead, or in a more drastic case, sleep with gloves.   The only other way I can think of would be to just concentrate on breaking the habit, moving your hand away from your face constantly while you're in bed
Gznvci2baa	I think you have the Flu. Drink lots of water, take vitamin c and rest. Thats all you can really do.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	Could be a combination of the cold and the flu. I would try taking some cold and flu meds. I wouldnt think the rash would be related. Unless you are getting a heat rash but that is usually if you have a fever. Good Luck and I hope you feel better soon.. Make sure you keep hydrated!!|`|9b36cd20c83580627b271744d6046be0aa	Sounds like the flu, better just stay in bed, eat chicken soup, and drinks lots of fluids.|`|rwXM6s50aa	fever. flu. cold. idk i'm not a doctor.         by the way go see one. DUUUUUUH       if there's something wrong with you that's a smart move to make!
fTW94Jdtaa	Well think of it like this......true there was no protein shakes, or fancy gym equipment, BUT there was no McDonalds, Jack-in-the-Box, Whataburger, Pizza Hut or any other delicious yet FATTY restaurants.     The protein could have also been ingested through meats as well.  Wild animals etc..    They worked almost all day long, in the sun, with no fancy tools to help.  Everything was manual labor.  I guarantee you don't buy/eat ANY fast food, workout with your own body weight or pick up heavy objects with no tools to assist(manual labor) and eat lean meat, grilled NOT FRIED chicken, and you should have that Spartan Six Pack in no TIME! :)|`|m7putYGmaa	most of them were just endomorphic to begin with|`|jhFT5kT1aa	they worked alot and did stuff by hand and just gained muscel by workin their whole lives|`|UPtvtm2Zaa	they ate meat and used their own body weight for all-day intense trainging    (sparring, pushups, pushing boulders, etc)    hold this helped|`|Tdzk4o5Iaa	Stop watching 300 so much.|`|gCW30ejoaa	Didn't you see "300"|`|XxR36ICHaa	Because they ate feasts of real food (rather than chips, macdonalds and candy) and worked at it all day everyday, lifting rocks and ****, until they got awesome. I heard somewhere that they tied rocks to their feet for like a year, and eventually they got so used to carrying them, that their legs got muscular, and they were extreemly fast once they took them off!|`|OXLJPgUlaa	nice name, prince.|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	They didn't "bodybuild"  they trained to be warriors.|`|etLfz702aa	they wore 80 lb suits of armor from the day they turned 8 years old.|`|sdYoRJnUaa	lol well you obviosuly got down watching 300, however ancient Greece was far diffrent.|`|Bk7E7MYNaa	by fighting and killing and running and stabbing and fighting some more!|`|Ig61vCA6aa	they ate like vikings though, meat. they are all about pride and streghtn, my guess, they did some hard core enviromental excersises. they could have lifted boulders, and found their own way for crunches.|`|nVfN8usNaa	Dunno. I'm not sure if diet was everything that contributed to their shape.  Probably their unrelenting and constant vigorous training.  Perhaps they ate lots of pasta and protein, I'm not sure.  Maybe they were like Micheal Phelps XD|`|UDKLeWd2aa	i am guessing they just worked out lifting minor objects and slowing understanding and lifting heavier objects, i don't think you will receive correct answers but my answer is more like a suggestion and about the protein shakes and other well if you ask me they are not that necessary to body build i mean you can get protein from a lot of animals so slowly and slowly things worked out and they got muscular, after all they were warriors so they had to work hard on there bodies and not all of them must be having great six pack physique or something.|`|nT31zeQaaa	idk hardwork|`|rkjQpGNWaa	i saw a documentary on it basicly they ate this wierd like protein sludge and constantly fought and worked out and stuff|`|WBSSDH5yaa	This website may help you out. It has good information about it;    http://munfitnessblog.com/how-to-build-3...|`|OyjRhwPXaa	now thats a question...    i think they did a fair amount of calisthenics mixed in with some hip hop ab drilling workouts.|`|L0jeEhChaa	http://www.sikyon.com/sparta/agogi_eg.ht...|`|9kxbdoAmaa	LOL did you watch 300 and then come and be like "HEY HOW DID THEY GET SO RIPPED BACK THEN" to be honest being fat back then showed class and it showed that you had money to take care of yourself.  Other than that they did have the Olympics they ran A LOT they did natural exercises. Im sure they spared with each other in ROMAN WRESTLING if that wasnt a big enough hit lol  I'm sure a great deal of physical work was evolved since there was no machinery|`|dW1Bn9q5aa	They killed people durrrr

You can probably die from ingesting weird hair growth formulas too.|`|K1gTGKWKaa	i don't think so i know allot of bald hippies
a9SYkDgUaa	Is wu yi tea a weight loss tea or is it just another scam and fraud. What are the wu yi tea ingredients that help in weight loss?    Many people have been wondering does wu yi tea work and what are its' side effects. The wu yi green tea is been used by the Chinese for centuries as medicines.    Yes, Guys can drink it.    Please visit following website for more details on wu-yi (oolong Tea)|`|UYvgIazcaa	wu-yi tea is just a brand name for what is called oolong tea.  It's no miracle worker, but it might help a tiny bit.    You want to lose weight tho?  Cut out 250 Calories from your day.|`|VX16L24Taa	My friend swears by it, I never tired it but Im going to get some, and give it a shot. She said it taste great, so even if it doesnt make me lose weight it suppose to be all healthy  green so thats a bonus.|`|ydNj7YM6aa	The formula for losing weight is easy - eat less food and workout more often - the problems appear when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are plenty of temptations in the big wide world aren't there?! The sole method which really worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I lost twenty pounds, it really does produce success!
HD7kdAnNaa	Sounds to me like you've got it all covered. If you have any moles or freckles you're worried about get them checked too. Your Dr will be able to recommend any other tests they think might be important when you get there :)
UpPWXRK4aa	If you are trying to lose weight then cardio is better, pushups and curls won't make you lose weight at all. Not sure what you are going for? Cardio-- Jogging, basketball, will make you lose weight. The other stuff will give you arm muscles lol.
FcNOkHquaa	It will help.  You might gain a little weight from muscle, but you'll notice you don't have as much fat, which is a good thing....    /m|`|XxR36ICHaa	If you want to loose weight, eat right, and do CARDIO for an hour a day. Do weights 3 times a week after cardio, but that will just help your muscles be defined, once you've lost some weight.|`|ph9ZE1veaa	hurt. muscle weights more than fat.|`|2VMwLAbQaa	if ur strictly tryen 2 lose weight, then lifting will hurt, cause muscle weighs more then fat, u will b losing fat but gaining muscle.|`|y8jIXgOdaa	hurt... muscle= more than fat. but you will be more toned|`|SIaTnM5Qaa	sure...cuz your burning fat and gaining muscle...but i dont dink 20 times aint gonna cut it....|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Lifting weights will help, but if you're trying to lose weight you may build muscle but not enough to replace all the fat you lost.|`|WeNWlYT4aa	Move to a city with a higher altitude than yours, in that city your weight will be less. OR, do you want to change your body composition, OR do you want to lower your body mass?|`|SlkKa1jsaa	Its going to help you,burns calories.And you wont lose as much muscle when losing weight.|`|9FrBtCfDaa	lots of reps with smaller weights will build lean strong muscle instead of huge bulky muscle. you would LOVE yoga or tai chi for this. it's about flexibility and balance, which builds lean muscle.    the up-side of building muscle is that muscles burn fat. just having muscles makes your metabolism stronger so it will be easier to lose weight if you want to.    good luck!|`|TwPF7EzYaa	it will help|`|650dd225538cb90d3886c7aa8f123997aa	Lifting weights will help, but keep breaking a sweat. It will depend on your activity level, metabolism, and diet.   You have to stay more active and get the cardiovascular system going on a regular basis. Match this with a little weight lifting and you might wind up with some better muscle tone too.    Don't forget to eat right along with it, (The right healthy things too).  And dont over do it especially at first. That's common.|`|g645WO3Paa	More cardio-vascular excercise than lifting.  Don't power-lift like body builders do.  Yes, muscle is hevier than fat, but maybe with us guys, lifting helps more. It's also a more enjoyable excercise than jogging or tread mills, or bikes...or aerobics.   I do recomend squash...it's hilarious when you miss the ball sometimes.   Sports= better than lifting for loosing weight.     Like I say, It will help, but don't power lift. Do more reps with just enough weight- that's strength lifting for endueace. It burns more.    But DO some cardio with it, or you won't get far.|`|Gpc9WHFyaa	Weight training can drastically multiply your weight loss efforts. Lifting weights builds muscle which in turn, burns more calories, helping you to lose weight and firm up. It is much easier to keep off the weight when you weight train because your body will burn more calories even at rest. For more info go to the website below. It has a good weight lifting routine and suggestions on supplements and diet.|`|kbjiPK4Iaa	Well lifting weights dnt make you gain weights it builds up muscle not fat.  The  1 way of loosing weight is running..so run!!|`|pkS7I3soaa	Youre just toning yourself right now. Not adding on muscle....so you are doing the right thing. =]|`|mohxk30laa	at first it will probably hurt, but when your muscles adjust it will help alot (especially if you eat protein after a good workout)|`|coqbBCh9aa	If your trying to lose weight what you should do is diet/eat less because, i learned in some health course that for girls, when they eat, they take in all the fat as energy, and any remaining fat is sent to your bum, and your sides, making you wide/fat. So, when you eat less then you won't gain weight!|`|dLeRiM76aa	both|`|Y2bpoU4Uaa	it will definitely help.  muscles burn calories, and the more muscle you have the more calories your body burns. so everyday tasks will burn more calories if have more muscle mass because of the fact that your movement involves said muscles.|`|cLSdkHZOaa	it will make you gain weight as far as a scale goes because muscle weights more than fat. but as far as appearance it shouldnt. depends what the area is i guess lol|`|CkGoQRLeaa	I've been following a similar plan along with eating healthy. I've been successful so far...I've lost 9 pounds in 3 and a half weeks. By doing some resistance training (like small weights) along with your cardio/fatburn routine, you'll build muscle mass. If you don't build up this muscle mass and dostrictly cardio, you'll only burn off water weight. With the addition of weight lifting, you'll help your body burn more calories when you do cardio and you'll tone, instead of losing just water weight and losing muslce. So no, it won't hurt you. Every little bit helps! Good luck
ps8H35yXaa	The first thing Doctor's look for with swollen lumps/lymph nodes is infection.  Because you have had this for 7 months is cause for concern.  The longer the lumps stay swollen, the bigger the chances are that it's cancer or some kind of tumor.  BUT that isn't always the case.    You're def. on the right track with the biopsy.  The hardest part about that is the wait.  It usually takes anywhere from a few days to a week to get your test results back, and even then they could be inconclusive.      Are you having any other symptoms?  Weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, itchy skin (especially your legs), Shortness of breath, bruising, I mean anything out of the ordinary should be brought up to your Doctor's attention.  What might seem like nothing could be something now that you found a lump.    If it is (God forbid) cancer, catching it early though is the best thing.  It could be nothing more than a fatty non cancerous tumor, it could be a cyst, or it could be a swollen lymph node caused by cancer.  It's really hard to tell unless you're having other symptoms.    If you're in good health, despite the lump, I'd say your chances of being sick are slim.  I myself found a lump on my neck that sort of appeared out of no where and it turned out to be Hodgkin's.  When I thought back to the previous year, I saw the signs of getting sick and having cancer, I just never put 2 and 2 together.  But believe me, the best thing that you could be is to be doing just what you're doing; getting a biopsy!    I wish you luck in everything and hope it works out!

If you REALLY want it gone, get something called Abreva. Expensive for the little bit you get, but it works.|`|v2ZBawa7aa	Well, if you were willing to buy Abreva from the drug store, you could use that.  If you were willing to go to the doctor and get a prescription, you could get an anti-viral drug and use that.|`|bLplapNIaa	The Abreva really works! Also throw out your lip gloss if you have exposed it to the cold sore, you'll continue to infect yourself with the contaminated tube, you'll get rid of it and then catch it again.

I'd suggest that you go to the library and start reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz--it's over thirty years old but the message is never old. I wish I could recommend a book for building self esteem, but I can't because they all have you acquire a goal to build self esteem and that becomes a trap. So after you get around to being interested in building true self worth then look into some of the links below. Yes you can feel great about you even in a bad hair day or a some extra weight on any part of your body and with enough movement in the self image process you just might find your body balancing itself out.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Well, Weight problem are often satirises of medicine and with the advice dismissed, easy to eat less, recent studies have established the theory that psychological factors can promote obesity, and now it is believed that the psychological impact for the improvement of weight - a consequence of this, but in no case does not cause obesity.    Try to start the day with a morning cocktail. Nourishing, low, with a lot of fiber, it will help to quickly clear the body, long and still hunger for a month to get rid of the excess of three kilograms.

SLFt8eHEaa	I took accutane and it was one of the best things I ever did.  My acne began to clear within a couple of days and within a month or so it was almost completely gone.  I still get the odd one or two pimples every now and then but nothing like the amount I used to.  As for side effects, the only one I had was that my hair wasn't as oily and I only had to wash it every two days instead of every day.  No chapped lips, no flaking skin, nothing.  They do have to do a blood test every now and then just to make sure that your liver function isn't being impaired (very rare), but compared to the benefits accutane brings that really isn't a hassle.|`|SRF2FiWPaa	--- it didn't work for me -- apparently it can also cause liver damage to some people --- up until twenty five I had perfect completion but then I got severe acne --- i also had some allergy -- if my complexion was clear and I ate peanuts in the shell they would not bother me if I did not eat the "skins" but some times I was like a lemming and I craved the peanuts in the shell ( with that outer part ) and I would break out.   ---- I am NOT a doctor but I think if I was like house I would not go with a band aid. ( acutane or other "acne" medicine ) I would first look into allergies and also I think the biggy is that if some one presents with super bad acne then I think treating the skin is not the best approach. -- I think severe acne might be a sign and symptom of the person's system being messed up and perhaps some organ or hormones out of whack. just my opinion though. I personally have no proof just my crazy theory but I bet in days gone by you would survive where others may not. You eat a little bit or walk past food in a grocery store and just "Look" at the food and your blood fat and cholesterol levels elevate. I think some bodies just are better at extracting and saving fat. in the old days this was good but with fatty foods being to plentiful now I think this causes acne for some. other things for others.   --- I took acutane but it did not help me|`|rDO6iEh9aa	I would only use this medication as a "last resort" to very bad acne that doesn't respond to other treatments. There are very negative side effects to using this drug. It should only be used IMO in extreme cases of cystic acne that doesn't respond to any other treatment. This mediation affects your whole body.|`|rcf96hb9aa	i have never taken it, but it can also cause you to become depressed! sounds like too many side effects, try something else!!|`|bugwMZcdaa	Took this a couple years ago and it worked wonders.  Was worried about the dry/ chapped skin and never had a problem.  Don't remember having my blood taken, but it would not be a big deal.  My acne did get worse like a week when I first started taking it and then it cleared up and I have not had a problem since.  If you have bad skin I would consider this, I am really glad I did.
0xFQj585aa	It definitely sounds like you've broken it. If it is crooked and you want it fixed you need to go straight to your doctor - Broken noses can be fixed with local anaesthetic up to about 15 days after the break happened. After that time the bone sets into its new position and is too hard to fix under local - for it to be fixed you would need a general anaesthetic and the nose would need to be rebroken and reset.|`|65lTdKNgaa	those are signs that you could have broken it!! =[ i think you should get an xray!!|`|a0p16oJTaa	Go to the doctor.

The weight loss market is huge so a lot of people are trying to cash in.  Ever heard of the "placebo effect"?  You will of course notice changes cause' you exercise but it was you who did it, not the pills.    Besides, aren't you scared of any potential side-effects?  How long have these pills been around to be proven 100% safe?

And you should always eat healthy- because eating many bad things can cause your acne to get worse.

Hope these ideas help.  All the best to you.|`|mmlYfz2jaa	Go to a dermatologist.  You'll probably be put on either doxy or monocycline and a topical like Duac or Differin.  If that doesn't seem to clear matters up, your skin might be "bad" enough that you could discuss Acutane as a treatment.      As far as "home remedies"? I tried a ton and they never worked.      Washing your face relentlessly will only irritate your skin.  Use something like a Neutrogena acne wash in the morning and before bed-- but only use a little bit.  Too much of that stuff will dry your skin out, clog your pores, and make everything worse.
ZqmgJvHBaa	I'm sorry that some people are giving you ridiculous answers.  Remember that most people answering on YA are very young and just looking for 2 points, so they will say just about anything.    If you know with a large degree of certainty that your sexual partners are all healthy, the chances of you having an STD are not as great.  Also, I assume that if you are sexually active, you are also using condoms, which reduce your liklihood of transmitting an STD (although nothing is foolproof).  Don't jump to the worst possibility first!  It sounds like you have a urinary track infection to me.  If you are sexually active, UTIs are more common.  It is important to wash yourself off and urinate after being sexually active in order to clear your urethra of harmful bacteria.    UTIs often feel like you seriously need to pee a lot of the time, but when you do there is not much there.  It will burn when you urinate, and you may notice a strange color to your urine, or it may be cloudy.  These symptoms are not always present, but the burning urination is almost always a sign of infection.  If it is an infection and you are only noticing a slight burn, go to the doctor now before it has a chance to get any worse.  The pain of a UTI can be tremendous and you definitely want to avoid it!  They will give you something like ciprofloxacin or macrobid to clear the infection, and probably phenazopyridine to ease the burn.  You can buy UTI test kits from places like walmart, kmart, kroger, whatever, if you dont want to spend money getting the test done at the doctor's office without being sure you have an infection.  All you have to do is dip a strip of test paper in your urine stream, and then look at what color it turns.  If it turns a certain color (the package will tell you what the different colors mean), then you have a UTI.  Go to the doctor!  UTIs can cause significant pain, damage, and in severe cases, death when left untreated for an extended period of time.  You can buy azo-gesic over the counter from just about any store, and it will help ease the burn until you can get to the doctor.  Azo-gesic is the same thing as phenazopyridine, and it will turn your urine orange, so dont be alarmed if you see this.  As far as the mouth blisters, it's probably just your braces rubbing you.  If you do have a UTI, it is an indication that your immune system is down, which will increase the likely hood of your braces causing you extra irritation, leading to the marks you noticed.  Your braces may scratch you insignificantly so that you neither feel nor see it, but due to your low immune system, those tiny cuts may become infected easily and turn into canker sores.  Rinse your mouth with salt water to significantly reduce healing time in your mouth and to ease pain (although the salt hurts and tastes gross while it's in your mouth).  If you do end up having a UTI, drink plenty of water and take your vitamins daily.  You can also try drinking cranberry juice and beer (in moderation of course) because these are healthy for your urinary track.  I have had many many UTIs in my lifetime, and they can be awful... but they are very easily treated!    I hope this advice helps.|`|quYp2Ajtaa	you prolly have a bladder infection, and your braces are prolly giving you blisters, I have had blisters inside my mouth before|`|NBf5q2f5aa	doc|`|lO2Cwk1Haa	Herpies dumb$hit did you kiss her while she had a cold sore or did you give her oral sex if you did you probably I garantee 200% that you have Herpies dumb@ss|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	It might be sifilis, but check your with your doctor|`|595BQdO8aa	hmm.. it could be. however when i had braces i got thos elittle white blisters too and sometimes when like its cold outside or like u sit on something cold then ur bladder like gets cold and thats when it burns to urinate and like u feel like u have to go again right after u go . but still check urself out with a doctor!!!!! cause if u dont treat urself right away then it could become untratable. there are free clinics where u can get tested|`|mZprL9TJaa	They could be related but I don't think they are. It sounds like you have a Urinary tract infection- and the blisters in your mouth can be a form of herpes - it is herpes simplex 1 which is the oral kind - herpes simplex 2 is the genital kind. It doesn't mean you do have herpes because other viruses can cause sores in your mouth. You should go see a doctor because if you do have a UTI you probably are gonna need antibiotics and all they need is a urine sample to diagnose it. Also talk to them about the sores in your mouth. There are over the counter creams you can get for cold sores but if it is from the herpes virus you may need a prescription pill or cream to clear it up completely.|`|AsSMWbdyaa	Urinary tract infection possible?

And if you cant you have to go into surgery to get rid of it. And yes it is some sort of STD|`|d1jMmApmaa	The "urination problem" sound like a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI).  A UTI is not an STD/STI and is extremely common in sexually active women.     UTIs are most often caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli) which is part of the normal flora in the colon. E. coli is commonly found near and around the genital and anal orifices where it can enter the the urethra and be pushed upward due to the undulating motion caused in the urethra during the thrusting of intra-vaginal sex.      Common symptons of a UTI include hematuria, (blood in the urine), cloudy urine, inability to urinate despite the urge, frequent need to urinate, malaise (general discomfort), dysuria (painful or burning urination), and fever.  All symptoms need not be present for a positive diagnosis.  An untreated UTI often progresses to bladder infection then to pyelonephritis which is charaterized by chills, high fever, nausea, pain below the ribs, and vomiting.  Untreated pyelonephritis progresses to renal infection then renal failure.    UTIs do not regress without treatment (usually just a week of prescription antibiotics).  Also, by urinating within the first 30 minutes after intercourse you can lower your risk of getting a UTI.    The sores in your mouth could be anything.  They might be abrasions from your braces or cold sores, canker sores, or fever blisters.    Good Luck!  Hope it helps!|`|x3istER1aa	you can heal it ask a doctor how to heal gonorrhea

t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.|`|6be1690c7fe8ce017a68606b85137484aa	If you are experiencing persistant numbness, tingling, burning pain or other abnormal sensations in your leg you need to see a doctor.

c55O7jqXaa	Well considering he had just eaten, then was crying and then had an injury it is understandable why he would throw up. Now image you just ate a full meal, cried a lot and hurt yourself like that you might feel sick to your stomach. The difference with children is they vommit quite easily and can't control it like the adults can. We know what we are feeling an can control ourselves down where children can't. Just keep an eye out for him. No sleeping is fine and if you are worried you can always let him sleep for awhile and then wake him up gently and then pat him back to sleep. You can also have him sleep with you tonight.     I am sure he is fine. I have had several concussions and I never had any problems not waking up. It would have to be a pretty bad blow to the head to be concerned about this. We are talking completely knocked out.|`|hoDin3UYaa	He could very possibly have a Concussion. I would definitely suggest you call his Pediatrician or take him to the E.R. right now.|`|TEhdnSdhaa	Take that kid to hospital|`|nBGjPwViaa	Give the doc a call to be sure.  The throw up may be just cuz he ate recently, but I'd not let it go by w/out checking...How bad would you feel if it is serious and you let it go???? The doc isn't gonna be mad if you call, so just call...|`|OkR3hrzZaa	Is he having any other symptoms? Dizziness or sleepiness? The vomiting was most likely caused by the shock of the fall and that he just ate. His stomach is little and sensitive and he was shaken up a bit. You don't typically see vomiting immediately after like that. I would put some ice on his head right away to slow down the swelling. If you feel concerned than take him to the ER. Head injuries aren't something to just take a guess on. You know how hard he hit his head so only you would know if it was enough to cause damage. Even if it wasn't that hard, if hit in the right spot it could still be dangerous. Just take notice to any other symptoms. Go with your gut. Good luck!|`|wQJtKx6zaa	You have much cause for concern. You do not want him to go to sleep, and if he threw up that's not good. Go with your gut, as I think everything in your body is telling you to take him to the ER. By ignoring it, you could be doing your son irreparable harm. Wanting to make sure your son is not in danger is not overreacting -- it's called good parenting. Plus, if you do ignore this and something does happen, children's services could step in and then you will have a lot of hell on your hands. Your biggest regret will be if something is wrong that could have been prevented by a simple check up.|`|etLfz702aa	If you're really worried, don't let him go to sleep for 8 hours after he hit his head. Nausea and vomiting is a symptom of a concussion, so you have a right to be worried.  Also, use a flashlight to see how his pupils react to light. If they don't contract to light take him to the doctor.|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	yesssssss. done let him sleep!!! he probly just threw up because he had just eten and got abit of a shock. if your really worried then take him to the docs. tell your husband to be more supportive and care more about his kids.|`|eVYXCvinaa	I work in Pediatrics.  I would take him to urgent care or the emergency room.  Just to be safe.  I have seen head injuries turn into nightmares.  Please go.  A small bleed may take a few hours to really show and it may be to late.  The vomiting worries me.  Go now!

What i think you should do is go to the Doctor and have him or her to tell you how much you should loose.

An apple for breakfast????? you're not getting any protein in your diet which can really be bad for you, this is how people faint or get anorexic. Eat a bit more for breakfast, for example egg whites. Keep the salad idea's but put in some grilled chicken so you can get some protein in your body. And eat more fruits, not just an apple for breakfast!

The more you eat, the more weight you lose.

In terms of your diet. you should eat more protein. If you like salads at least put some chicken and cheese in them. For breakfast have some carbs (cereal, toast, oatmeal).

TT6Nk0JNaa	It shouldn't be harmful as long as the ring is about the same thickness as an earing.  I wouldn't recommend trying to pierce your own belly button, there are places that do it for you and are safer and less painful. But if you insist on trying, make sure you use a well-disinfected, *smooth* needle, and keep the piercing well disinfected, and don't go too deep. If you mess up you could permanently scar your belly-button so be careful!|`|K1gTGKWKaa	cant see any reason a naval ring wouldn't work in your ear  a tattoo shop can do it for you and they know what their doing|`|JDl352H2aa	no not at all its all body percings! u just can't put your earring in your belly button
e5fUECl2aa	Not bad at all. Its definately not good, but if your not inhaling and only smoking 1-2 a week... not a problem at all, you just might experience bad breath, bad taste in mouth, and smelly clothes. Now if you did this for years and years without caring for your teeth/mouth at all, than you might have some issue, like tooth decay or even mouth cancer. If your really concerned about having problems occur in your mouth, than just brush your teeth/use mouthwash afterwards just to be safe, and you should be good. But smoking anything is always bad for you.

GaYLCY1Waa	i get that too!! i know it sounds weird but what made that stop for me is tanning! i tan like once every three to four days and i have no razor burn. and i use regular shaving cream and a good razor. just make sure youre not shaving to hard and not everytime youre in the shower! and i always use lotion after i shave anywhere. it helps tons! they have special lotion for dry and irritated skin from jergens that i use. and no you dont have to shave down there if you dont want to! its completely up to you! good luck!|`|n24githIaa	If you want to shave, it's up to you.  I still shave, although it's getting harder for me since I'm pregnant.  But make sure your area is completely in the water when you shave it.  Never use an electric razor to shave that sensitive area. :|  The red bumps are razor burn and they should go away in about a week.  Try using a razor with a lotion strip coated on it.  Razors for men typically have the lotion strip, even the disposable kind.  Good luck. :)|`|pi3GbgpFaa	At first it is usually red and bumpy, just from razor burn. It's normal for it to be this way the first time.

No wonder it hurts, you've basically shaved yourself raw, dear.  Don't do that.    For now, treat it like a diaper rash.  Get get yourself some diaper rash cream and use that to soothe the redness and irritation.    No, you don't HAVE to shave your bikini area.  There are such things as "boy style" bottoms, if you're having an issue with your pubic hair showing in a bathing suit.   But, if you do choose to trim a bit, my advice would be to use a very creamy shaving cream or preparation, and to let the hair soften for a bit before GENTLY shaving yourself.  Don't push down so hard and please do not shave, shave, shave over and over.    John Jones, M.D.

I can also tell you if you are a teen that many teens seem to be tired and sleep alot. Hormones affect your body and you can be tired while your body is changing.    There are many diseases that also make you tired even when you sleep 8 or even 14 hours. My sister was tired constantly and she went to the doctor to check it out and found she had cancer so it is important that you get a medical checkup.|`|JfumPukYaa	go to the dr.. get a blood test|`|AA10019611	What kind of lifestyle do you have? Even if you sleep a lot if you have an inactive lifestyle you will still feel tired. I know it sounds counter intuitive but the more active you are then the more efficient your sleep will be and therefore you will be better rested feel more energized the next day provided you get the right amount (7-10 hours, 14 is overkill). Try to keep a constant schedule as well. If you are constantly going to sleep at different hours then this will also have an effect.
RGvNRH8Iaa	Is it painful and/or sensitive?  Sometimes if a lot of plaque accumulates along the gumline, it will turn brown.  That is called calculus, and it is not decay but it does need to be cleaned off because it will inflame your gums.      If it is decay, the cost to fill it really depends on how bad it is.  If the decay is not extensive yet, and all you need is a simple filling, it usually costs between $150 to $300.  But if the decay has gone too far, and the tooth needs a crown and/or root canal it could be hundreds or even a couple thousand dollars.      I really dont think a month will make much difference though, as long as you are not in pain.|`|p4Rx5392aa	if you're in extreme pain i'd go right away. you really should go right now, but having a cavity filled without dental insurance is very costly. i have insurance and after one filling and cleaning ect, my insurance coverage is almost out. if you wait for your insurance it shouldn't cost you anything. hopefully your insurance kicks in soon, but if it's not more than a couple months, no further damage should happen. weigh the pros and cons, but if your in pain, definately go.
YCmvBc05aa	You can go to RiteAid or CVS and buy the over-the-counter temporary filling material that they sell.     That should hold long enough for you to get through the pregnancy.    Usually this type of temporary filling easily lasts for up to 3/4 months if you dry out the tooth thoroughly and then put it in.     You can replace it as needed.     Also, favor the other side when you eat.

7gcdOCbtaa	Yes ,if your honest to your Dr.     Your Dr. is there to help you, that goes with any questions you may have about your medicine. YOU SHOULD ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS AS HE HAS THE DEGREE & KNOWS YOU, NOT US.It's normal to have to call him & tell him if you think it's not working for you or if it has a side affect that you don't like.Communication is the key to life. So go talk to him ask for a sooner appointment. if you need it or a phone appointment if he will do that.    Good Luck|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Fairly classic symptoms.

Two easy things you can do today to drop fat:     1) Get instant access to a weight loss program to teach you what to eat here: http://bobs-reviews.com    2) Do at least 30mins of cardio 4x per week     I guarantee if you do those two things, you'll lose fat.    ~Robert|`|MoyvVnBZaa	Cardio is really good for burning fat--walking, running, biking, swimming, dancing.

I shed thrity pounds, it definitely does work!|`|gWXxYjEQaa	I honestly do not recommend using pills because it may work on some people and it may not. It's not worth the risk. Try to jog on a treadmill or in your neighborhood at least 3-4 times a week and control your food like more fruits and vegetables.I did this for a month and a half and I saw my results. It worked.  *Natural dieting is better than artificial dieting*

It was so sad. The worst part was that she got up and attempted to do it again. One of the store clerks told me that she was crawling in a funny way, probably meaning that she had severe damage to her head, and broke several bones in her body. It sounded SO painful.

5INu2kzdaa	you can get warts orally and by basic skin contact. you can get them removed tho|`|wQSsw8QHaa	yes go get them burned off|`|wQJtKx6zaa	What about oral? Herpes can be spread orally. Do you recall having someone perform oral sex on you? If so, she may have transferred it to you that way. Bottom line, stop asking us and go see a doctor at your closest clinic fast. By ignoring this problem you could be doing yourself harm. Don't let your fears keep you from protecting your health. Young people get sick too.|`|OrUrqkRXaa	You can get genital warts threw oral sex.  If the person that gave you oral has come in contact with them.  A great way to get rid of genital warts is by using wartrol.  It has worked great for my closest ones.  http://www.wartrolwarts.com
SG27rfSdaa	No. It's not contagious, not if you kiss someone and not for your baby. As far as being genetic-passed on by genes it may be but it wouldn't affect a small baby- this usually happens when we get older like I got it in my twenties from meds and you can get it from spicy foods, etc.  Don't worry.|`|fYTcFygUaa	yes...you burp to much
cb2NxPERaa	Lose about 15-20 pounds and build some muscle by consuming protein and doing crunches. Lose the weight by joining a sport and watching your diet.|`|XxR36ICHaa	it's really hard when you're still growing.  However, when I want abs (because I'm going to the beach or whatever) I do 200 crunches, and the next morning I've got em.. but that's because I don't have much tummy fat so you can see them well... give it a try... or if not, when I want to be really toned up, I give myself a week, and do 200 then a day off, 300 the a day off 400 then a day off 500 then a day off 600 then a day off etc... But don't try to do more than 300 all in one go, (start with doing 50 a few times a day)|`|hJuPsaSDaa	The pattern for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and workout more - the problems arise when we actually try to put that into practice! There are lots of temptations in the real world aren't there?! The one diet that really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I worked off 25 pounds, it really does produce results!|`|ZmYTngnFaa	sure, anyone can if you ARE serious you need to eat lotts of healthy food. not just lean meat and veggies, I mean, spaghetti, lots of carbs, no energy drinks, those are bad for you.  I say this because your body need sugar and carbs to build fat, so it can burn that fat to make muscle. If there is no fat (or sugar) it starts to burn muscle, and this (the largest one being your heart) can lead to heart problems, breathing problems, etc.  good luck be careful. :)|`|VX16L24Taa	Why not hun. Work out eat right, and you should be able to achieve whatever goals you want for physical fitness. Plus what your asking is 100% reasonable, you might want to make sure your healthy by a doctor, and go to a gym, get a trainer if you can and start working out. In time you will see great things happen to you body. But dont over do it, that will never help, as your body is developing, at such as young age.|`|XclKJeHFaa	Well Es pretty much got it. What i found that works is doing a regular schedule of crunches daily and also spend time outside and run around. Eating is another thing, you need to eat at three times a day and maybe a snack once in a while. If your overweight or just a little heavy then eating healthy really does work. you need to get skinny before you work on your abs. Just remember to do a daily routine of things like push ups, sit ups, and maybe even a small jog. Hope this helps.                                                       your teenage friend. :)
150esu4Daa	I went to the doctor yesterday and found out I have a kidney infection. My doctor put me on antibiotics but also gave me vicodin for pain. This evening, after having three doses of antibiotics I'm still in pain, but the pain medicine helps with that. From my understanding it should take about three days for you to feel better, but even then remember to continue taking all of your meds until they are gone, just because you feel better doesn't mean the infection is completely gone. Good luck!

57DG5xC1aa	Before you go to sleep, slather on a TON of lotion. Put a sock on top of it and just sleep! When you wake up in the morning, it should be soaked in.    Beware: if your socks are fairly thin, it could seep through.|`|ydCoPRkRaa	put lotion on before bed and put socks on|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Lotion! Put a lot on before you go to bed at night and put socks on.

Anyway:  I have a problem with dry skin and cracking on my feet, but I use "Bag Balm".  It's thick, like Vaseline, comes in a green can, and is available at most any Walgreen's or the like over the counter.  It was formulated to keep cow milker's hands from cracking in New England winters.  Just a day or two of application and you'll see the difference.  I guess it works by sealing in your natural moisture, and sealing out the drying salt of the perspiration on your feet.  Also, if you have babies, this stuff is great for diaper rash, and many other kinds of heat-rash type of irritations.  (Unless it's a fungus or yeast infection; then you'll need something else.)|`|CNhFjXd9aa	an exfoliation MIGHT help. Try OLAY thermal pedicure|`|zwe9MHqGaa	burts bees has a special heel wax formula. always does the trick for me when lotion doesnt cut it|`|mHcmxfEZaa	put vasaline and then socks on when you go to bed.  Also i heard if you use stridex pads (bc of the acid that is in it) once a week before you do the vasaline and socks that it will help even more.|`|4cFYbySCaa	If you have athlete's foot it will need to be treated with an anti-fungal cream. You can get these at the drug store. If you problem is very bad, a doctor can prescribe heavier strength creams. If it is simple dryness that's the issue, get a good foot cream and put it on before putting on a thick pair of socks.
QBUypAmAaa	I don't think it should matter much.   Men can't control how big they get.  And no man in his right mind is going to have one removed because a woman or anyone is intimidated by their size.  I like having large ones really, I find them more fun.  So just be proud you have a pair really lol.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I doubt it.|`|5Aej2zebaa	I have never been intimidated by testicle size. the don't really have a big job when i'm just getting busy.

AA12066269	It is very very rare for women your age to get breast cancer.  If it is cancer there is a good possiblilty you will live a long and fruitful life.  Many women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, including myself are doing well and leading productive lives.      I do know that the waiting to get the biopsy and then waiting for the results will seem like the longest week or two you have ever spent.  Try to do some fun activities to get your mind on other things.  Watch a silly movie or go hang out with your friends, just try to keep busy and good luck to you.|`|vPIHndQ3aa	if you caught it early there is a great chance of survival, you still don't know if you have anything so don't freak out, im a guy and i had a lump on my chest area that was hard, didn't move was a yellowish hue and hair growth was less there, accompanying  this was chest pains, i was scared and im 16, it turned out to be nothing but cartilage, and it was yellow because i kept touching it. I also had trouble breathing, it turned out i had asthma, so don't jump to conclusions, stay positive. Good luck to you
0xFQj585aa	Cancer is hard to treat because it is not a foreign organism attacking you like bacteria and viruses.  Cancer is your own body's cells going haywire. It is really difficult to target a therapy against the cancer cells that does not damage your healthy cells. That is why chemotherapy is so toxic and has so many awful side affects - it is a poison that kills all your cells, it just kills the fastest growing cells faster.|`|Iar0ngMXaa	One reason why cancer is hard to treat is because alot of the treatments will also attack healthy cells. If someone's white blood cell count drops too low because of chemotherapy they will quit or suspend the treatment. Also over time cancer tends to become resistant to treatments., alot of recurrent cancers become resistant to the treatment and this is why recurrent cancer is so much harder to manage.|`|AA10423514	The pharmaceutical company's are making way to much money treating the disease than curing it  There is a guy on U-tube from Nova Scotia (Canada) that claims hemp oil to be a miracle cure

MoyvVnBZaa	Don't make it your goal to be skinny; make it your goal to be healthy, fit, and toned. Eat healthy meals, don't go on a fad diet or anything. Just limit junk food and have plenty of whole grains, protein, fruit, veggies, etc. If you want to burn fat, cardio is the best way--walking, running, biking, dancing. Do crunches to work your abs.|`|uXlRw6yXaa	It sounds like you're pretty in shape if you're that tall and weigh only 86 pounds.  I was much bigger than you at that age, but I managed to have a flat tummy just by playing sports and doing crunches.  The sports kept my legs and arms in shape, and my weight was good.  I just did extra crunches every night before bed and every morning when I woke up.  You shouldn't have any trouble since you're athletic :)|`|5RpeItGVaa	to get rid of the belly fat i would suggest crunches sit ups curl ups....

dZxjXHA2aa	Most typical sexually transmitted diseases cannot be transferred from one species to another, HOWEVER sexual contact with animals can put the person at risk for worms, fleas, ticks, salmonella, campylobacteriosis, scabies, and possibly viruses.    In the future, if you choose to engage in such activities I would recommend protection such as a condom to prevent infections and if this wasn't an experiment but truly based on sexual attraction to animals, you may want to speak with a health care professional so that you better understand what you may be opening yourself up to germ wise.|`|3e35a0513fedfde324327c2ce1f90a3baa	why would you rape a dog? i feel very sorry for the dog.|`|IodpgIk7aa	the fact that you had sex with your dog is probably the problem...wtf? go to a doctor|`|d0MIgl38aa	the law should be on the way to your house you sick fuc*|`|NoZAofgOaa	yeah ok,|`|zfQDHAkUaa	your a sick sick sick man...you should be ashamed. thats animal abuse.  you deserve whatever you got.|`|yfwSDroNaa	the answer: go to a doctor..prooonto!  what the hell were u doing with a dog?!?!?!|`|etLfz702aa	you're a freak if you had sex with your dog.

c55O7jqXaa	Try giving him some Mylanta. This is what they gave my Sister in laws boy who also is a good eater, but became constipated and had horrible wrenching pain in his tummy area and it worked like a charm.     Ok if he has bowel movements, but continues to have this pain then I suggest getting him into the doctor. Where exactly is the pain and does it radiate? or stay in the same spot? What exactly does it feel like- sharp stabbing pain, a dull ache, pulled muscle pain? You say healthy, but is he getting plenty of water? Does he drink a lot of soda? Is he eating veggies and I don't mean corn. A lot of cabs will do this to you too.     Another natural way to get your bowels going is Dark Karo Syrup. The sugar in it gets your body going. Make sure he is not eating a lot of greasy- fattening foods right before bed.     Also he could have some Irritable bowel things going on. Has he ever had any problems before even when he was younger? Do you think he may be coming down with a gastrointestinal virus? This can cause pain too.     Keep on on some light foods and expecially at night. Increase his raw veggie intake and lay off the sodas and caffeine. Drink plenty of water and flush out that body.    If continues go and see a doctor.|`|AA10450066	I believe you're on the right track.What does he eat before going to bed because this too can cause these symptoms. Since he's still eating and there isn't any nausea or temperature try giving any of the products OTC that you have in the house for gas and/or constipation.if he still has problems, it's definitely time to see the doctor or if he loses his appetite, the pain increases,or he starts to vomit.|`|YfWm7YbIaa	this happens to some people when they have air in their stomach...idk if it is but drink some hot tea and see what happens if he is going to pass out any and drink water...if nothing happens go ahead with the appointment|`|VDXsfMLWaa	I work for a GI doctor and I would advice you to make your son an appointment with his Primary doctor if he continues to have this problem and possible get reffered to a GI specialist if your doctor thinks its necessary.

8VIi1LP5aa	First, Do NOT listen to that jerk below.  Maybe you could try and talk to him and see whats going on with him.  Second.  High School is a living hell for some people.  I know.  Don't be depressed.  I know its easier than it sounds but you have your whole life ahead of you out of highschool.  If I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have let trivial things like that bother me.  Its hard when someone your close to sort of moves away from you but you will make new friends and everything will be better once you get out of highschool.  College is an amazing experience.  And even if you dont go to college dont worry you will make lots of new friends and even a new best friend.  If you are still feeling super depressed you should try talking to a counselor dont do anything rash.  Trust me you have your whole life ahead of you.....|`|qHCtBq07aa	So I'm assuming there wasn't a reason behind his decision to rid himself of you? There wasn't anything you might have said or did to make him rid himself of you?   If he basically through your relationship out the window without any words, then you should do the same.   Realize that yes he was important in your life, and try to gain closure. Through out anything that reminds you of him, make your locker not look so empty and get out there and find new people to talk to.   Maybe you can create a scrapbook of you and him and finish it like its another chapter in your life.   If you can, seek closure from him as to why he up and left and tell him to give you at least that.

I am 13 and weigh 105lbs and i am 5'4' and my boobs are a D cup, but just one year ago they were a a cup... so you never know!  hope things turn out well for you!|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	You're quite petite, so don't be surprise to be on the smaller side.    There's no abnormal size to be honest. Bigger girls usually get a bigger bust, while smaller girls get a smaller bust. Genetics play most of the role in deciding the final product. The only way to modify things a little bit is through gaining or losing weight.    There's of course always the boob job route, though personally, I find a normal A cup much sexier than a fake C cup.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Yes, you are 14 and still growing.

V5xHaIAcaa	This is a difficult question.  However, there are some good answers, and I do hope this is one of the better answers you get.    I assume (yes I know the danger of that) that you might be taking psychotropic drugs.  A psychotropic drug acts on the brain's chemicals like serotonin, or norepinephrine or dopamine (forgive spelling).  Here is the deal:    (They all have undersirable side-effects)  (All the side effects generally suck)  (The trick is to find the one that has the "LEAST" undersirable side effects)    Worse yet (ya, I know: when is the good news comming) it is mostly a trial and error approach.    Here is the good news:  Most often, a correct combination can and will be found, but it is going to take lots of heart ache, pain, whatever before that happens.  But when it does happen you will be so happy that you found the right combination.    Look, I will say a prayer for your suffering to be a small as possible.    Please stay with it, keep trying, and God Bless|`|AA11388527	Sorry.  Not nearly enough information.

V5xHaIAcaa	If you have a legit script you are totally in the clear.    Any drug or chemical compound can be tested for    Google: metabolic half-life of drugs    Nothing short (just take my word on this) of a complete, and I mean complete, blood transfusion will even remotely have a chance of sucess.    Trust me on this one, better off to resign, and not take the drug test, or withdraw an application than to get "caught" using something for   which you are not being prescribed by a medical doctor.    But, it is your life (or lack thereof)    Do your homework|`|AA11388527	Since you used bad judgment already by not bringing this up BEFORE the test, make up for it by being forthcoming and disclose this information ASAP.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	some of the ingredents show in it and can be linked back to the drug|`|NOoEI13uaa	Yeah. Some do, but  it's all based on what color these chemical strips turn, like if it's purple you have weed in your system, if it's green, you got methadone. (I just made up those colors for example. I'm not sure how there colorcoded) They'll probably be able to tell what it is, but if you are taking a drug that is your perscription, make sure you tell em before the test or you might could get yourself into a mess.|`|WAGpAh8oaa	hell yes but if u have prescriptions then your fine|`|nG9nxMySaa	different drug tests check for different things. but i don't think they should be testing for legal drugs because you have a right to medical privacy. it is illegal for a workplace to discriminate based on medical info, unless the drugs are going to make it dangerous for you to work there (e.g. they probably wouldnt want someone on xanax operating machinery.)|`|ZnywY78Daa	If you have prescriptions your all good if not then it depends on if they are testing for that certain kind of drug|`|QLWbJIUeaa	do DRUGS show up in a DRUG TEST?  thats a hard one|`|sAr3YV62aa	Normally, the people who you are applying for would know about your medical conditions if you told them. If they find an overdose, they will notice, though.|`|2GPCuuYRaa	they will show up...but it doesnt matter if you can explain it all.  and|`|wntdMR8caa	well they may or may not. you cant really tell until they come up. if anything does show up just assure the people you are taking the test for that you have perscriptions for them and just be willing to show them. possible a note from your doctor will help.|`|untdVk2Naa	Depends on how many panels the drug test is.  Some tests will only test for weed, cocaine, and methamphetamine, whereas others test for everything.  If you have legitimate prescriptions though, you have nothing to worry about.|`|n91Wf2jeaa	Different test show different chemicals just explain your taking medication and everything will be fine.|`|tk2AOZU5aa	Yes, if you are taking Xanax, Ritalin, or any kind of stimulants, sedatives, narcotics, opioids, or controlled drugs, it will show up on a urine drug screen. There is nothing you can take, or any amount of water you can drink to wash it out of your system. You should not be taking that crap to begin with. You are just messing up your body and you will end up paying for it later.|`|1drXUvLiaa	Yes if they test for those sort of drugs they will show up. I know this for fact. Anything in your blood or urine can be traced up until a certain time period. It all depends on the toxicology report and if they want to spend the extra money to get to the results.

oN9vSZlhaa	The frequencies of these ring tones are just on the verge of not being heard by any human! The ability to hear these is not actually a test of how well you can hear, but rather the highest frequency of sound you can detect. You may actually have the best hearing of all your classmates, you can detect a whisper or perfectly understand a conversation far away, the fact of the matter is the ability to hear these ring tones isn't of any importance. Adults struggle to hear them because a natural regression in their perception of certain frequencies. A harmless and natural process.
AA12294744	The flu.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Sounds like a flu bug to me. Just stay indoors, hunker down under your favorite blanket, plop yourself in front of the television, sip on some ice or ice water if you are able to hold it down, if you start vommiting you can take Emetrol which is over the counter. It is very sweet, but it works to stop that vommiting, dirrhea use immodium. For the fever unless it gets real high just let that run it's course. Take some tylenol for the aches and pains and put a cold cloth on your neck or head. I hope you feel better soon.|`|xKbPNK4vaa	Possibly the flu?

f2824c0ffab42869900d5ccd3ca8501eaa	I would say no. Hard contacts are made much differently than soft, therefore they require a solution that is especially made for them.

BwDdJp5aaa	I agree with the previous answer as far as gaining weight once you do decide to eat. But with that being said the easiest was to drop pounds like crazy without spoiling your goal would be to eat only whole fruits and vegetables while raising your heart rate and being almost out of breath but still able to hold a conversation without having to gasp for air. That is when the most fat is being carried through your bloodstream and used as energy. Drink as much water as you can!!! You should be happy to know that water contains no nutritional value at all!!! Yet at the same time will trick your body into thinking it's full. As far as the whole fruits and veggies they are used to supply you with the vitamins and HEALTHY calories, NO BAD cholesterol (found in meat). Many people are fat because they don't figure out information on their own. You, I imagine, haven't done any research. I'm not being negative. Only truthful. Her are some links. Most likely you will find you target weight to be well within the norms, just not to American's standards.  Hope this helps and good luck on living healthy and skinny!|`|UB7pWWHeaa	sorry but if you want support to lose weight i would say eat something unless you wanna get fat again in a few years or weeks or however long you wanna keep this up....... is the short term really worth you in a few years from now? if you starve you will gain weight later in life when you realize it is time you need to eat proper meals.|`|OXLJPgUlaa	well since you've already been starved for 2 weeks i think you can do this.    trap yourself in a room with lots of stuff to do that do not require hunger afterwards.  exercising would not be good, because you will be so tempted to it.  umm...you can go on your computer and tv and stay there for hours...sleep for hours....drive for hours....|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	Another one of these huh.  Please.  You aren't anorexic, you're something called wannarexic.  You're an extreme dieter and believe me you won't stick to this much longer.  Most wannarexics stick to it for a few months, then they start to binge, then they give up and gain all the weight back plus some.  The they start the cycle again.  True anorexics are offended by these people.    Anorexia is a horrible disease and if you really had it, you'd HATE it.  Real anorexia makes you miserable, you struggle To eat, not KEEP FROM eating.  You aren't control of the voice in your head that says your fat and one bite of food will make you gain lots of weight.  People struggle with this every day.    People like you are insults to truly mentally ill people that really suffer from anorexia.  You spread the rumors that anorexics are vein or stuck up and only want to look pretty.    Plus, this may be working for you now, but it won't long term.  You'll binge, believe me.  It's a natural instinct to binge when you fast or restrict.  True anorexics don't because they are mentally ill.  Since you don't have this mental illness, you will start bingeing and gain much more weight than you lose.  Promise you.|`|kw2OJnWFaa	k to loose weight without being a nerexic can be easy just excersise lots but if you for some reason still want to be anerexic??? To make youself not hungry dont think about food and mabey try fasting its much easier than being temtedx to eat all day long, or vomiting everything you eat...  And if you just dont want to eat for a long time all you do is keep your mind set on your goal try not to think about or look at yummy foods you enjoy!!!  Hope I helped...|`|68iG4Tr3aa	Here's a question; do you love yourself? I know you said you didn't want to hear this but, Honestly, Anorexia is a poor choice for a "diet." It is way too extreme and very harmful. If you really need some inspiration, my best advice would be to eat "watery" foods that fill you up/ are healthy/and won't make you gain an ounce weight.(not to mention, you'll be so full, you wont want to eat) (believe me please!) such as celery, apples, etc. When you do eventually start eating again (which you will) your body's metabolism will actually get slower than what it is now and nomatter what, you will gain weight. I really don't want anything to happen to you (although I don't know you) but I know the consequences of an eating disorder, and they are deadly.please just think about your self worth and the other people around you who are probably extremely worried about you. Would you rather hurt yourself or the people who care about you?
zjsP15dpaa	I was always told at night is the best time.|`|XZHx3v4Raa	it really depends on you.but morning is best because later you'll be too lazy|`|QajuWPzxaa	i would say in the evening or early morning!|`|GUvw17PSaa	i workout after school i usually eat a snack then after the gym i go have dinner     sometimes i eat diner first then go       hope this helps|`|XkuR8ZJPaa	I've heard both morning and night so I'm not really sure.  My suggestion would be when you have the time and energy.  If you can get a better workout in the morning because you just woke up and you have energy then go then.  If you are more of an evening person then go then.  You have to have the energy to workout and if you don't have it then you wont work out as hard.  Personally I have to go in the evenings.  If I worked out in the mornings I would not get much done.|`|wxsY78Rtaa	There really is no BEST time, as such.   But from experience and research, I think the "best" time to work out is in the morning, you get the adrenalin kick and the metabolism boost to start your day. Also if you try to exercise in the evening you are more likely to put it off, ie long day at work, too tired, good show on tv lol    It's all a case of trial and error on your part to find the time that is BEST for YOU :)    Good luck|`|ZnY3gXcKaa	Everthing I have read indicates early morning...|`|d6IVA6mRaa	There really is no best time. People will say in the morning or at night, but really it won't matter. As long as you do.|`|xF7XLRQzaa	Early morning, when you wake up.  Gets you motovated for the day.|`|UxNxb9Ncaa	if you exercise right when you wake up it gets you up quicker and raises your metabolism for the rest of the day.  plus then you won't need that coffee with it's sugar and creamer and all those extra calories. If you exercise at night it raises your metabolism and starts pumping adrenaline and endorphins into you that will keep you awake much longer than you want to be.    this is all assuming you wake up in the morning. if you work the night shift you figure it out.
QiqLB1V7aa	Is this for a medical reason?  If so, one way you might find it easier to sleep on your back without having free range of movement to turn around would be in a reclining chair.  Stuff some pillows between you and the arms of the chair, almost locking your midsection into place.  I had to sleep on my back when I hurt my arm a few years ago, and this is what the doctor suggested for me because I almost always sleep face down.  It would have possibly worked out great, except I don't and didn't have a reclining chair.  So I'm just basically suggesting what I was told.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	Nice one LJP...

DmyqvxmJaa	Any time you miss a period twice in a row, it can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, which can happen after pregnancy. Go to a doctor, and there's many treatment options to cure imbalances.  Hope this helps! :)|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I stopped bleeding and then got my period in a month and a half. Im some what regular. I have a period every 3 weeks. I would think that it is normal to go that long if you are irregular. I would still call a doctor such as you ob/gyn and tell them what is going on. There might be something wrong or some advice that they can give to you. I know after giving birth is really stressful so maybe your period is waiting until the moment you are least stressed. Good Luck!!|`|khxs0ZjPaa	It probably IS hormonal imbalance, although pregnancy can alter your hormone levels indefinitely, so you may have lighter or heavier ones for a while until you either talk to your doctor or your hormones balance themselves out.
AA11388527	Apo E testing, the Alzheimer's index skin test.  Also helpful is the MMSE, PET scan.  These are some of the tools used.  The Alzheimer's index skin test is a reliable way to diagnose it.    The best tool is a competent and careful doctor who takes into account the medical history, medication history, mood evaluation, mental status exam, complete physical exam, relevant labs, neuro exam, imaging, referral to a neurologist and/or psychiatrist and/or neuropsychologist.    The earliest detection is probably by those closest to the one affected.  They know "something" is wrong.  Look again at a definition of Alzheimer's and dementia in general.  Look again at the cognitive and behavioral dementias cause.|`|tk2AOZU5aa	The only true test for Alzheimers is to do a brain biopsy after a person has died. When a person is living, we go by symptoms people have to determine if they have the signs of Alzheimer's and give them the diagnosis of Alzheimer's based on their symptoms. Also, now some physicians are using PET scans to help determine if a persons brain has enough atrophy, or shrinking, this can be a strong sign of Alzheimers.

But no, masturbation hasn't harmed your physical or mental health, and it won't, because it is very healthy, and studies show it prevents prostate cancer.|`|KBaD6Mqhaa	Is masturbation healthy?  Masturbation is a healthy and normal practice, like daydreaming or napping. Even masturbating several times each day is completely harmless. You may encounter people, books, or websites that say masturbation is bad or harmful; this is just plain incorrect. As any reputable medical doctor will tell you, old myths about masturbation affecting the eyesight, causing permanent fatigue or insanity, etc., have long been disproved. In fact, recent studies suggest that ejaculating regularly isn't just fun, it can actually help prevent a certain kind of cancer later in life.    Why masturbate?  First and foremost, because it feels good, and second, because ejaculating semen reduces the sexual tension that builds up in adult men and especially teenagers. However, recent studies suggest that ejaculating regularly isn't just fun, it can actually help prevent a certain kind of cancer later in life.    look it can not damage you mentally and unless you rub it raw or something like that not physically either so do not worry if it feels good then do not worry just stay away from porn as that can become an addiction|`|tK1yoGTkaa	Yeah dude!

ReGhCqgVaa	There is nothing you can do to help him.    The most important thing to do is be there for your friend no matter what.  Make sure to hold her when she cries. Tell her you're always going to be there for her. Talk to her when she seems stable enough to have a conversation. Go out places with her when she seems comfortable with leaving the house [It's also very important for her to spend time with her family right now..so don't take her away too often]    It's going to be extremely hard on your friend to get through this. Make sure your friend doesn't go into a depression because of this [I've seen it happen to one of my friends..it's hard to watch and help them]    Make sure she doesn't get any harmful habits. Make sure shes not eating too much/too little. Harming her body in anyway on purpose, getting too violent with others, ect. If she does start doing harmful things you need to talk to her right away and try to get her to stop.. If she refuses to stop and it continues consult a family member right away.    People all have their own ways of dealing with the death of a love one. Talk to your parents about the situation and see if they have any advice for you as well. Chances are they've seen someone go through it or gone through it themselves.    Just be a friend and help. It's all you can do. She needs it.    I hope I helped out a little  I'm truly sorry for your friend.  I hope everything turns out okay.|`|3YukdxCqaa	If your friend's family hasn't done it already, have them look into the Hospice program.

There are some excellent books available to help your friend learn to help make her Father's death be the best it can be.  I know that sounds strange, but this is something that is so important, and it gives the loved ones who survive a sense of accomplishment when they can do that.  It also helps with the healing process.  A great book for her to read is "Final Gifts" by Maggie Callanan and Patricia Kelley.  Her Father will send messages through voice or body language letting them know what he needs done before he can pass.

Sucks to be you!!!|`|asYkSDdFaa	What are you high on?|`|nUdhTvHDaa	dont get high|`|3208995a056e331b2cc1bc88d9590058aa	dude you're just tripping out. i used to experience the same thing. when you smoke weed sometimes you put thoughts in your mind out of paranoia and then convince yourself that they're actually happening.  you just have to learn to control that paranoia|`|4UmZbz7gaa	do some stretches.|`|fkklc14haa	I'm high, and my knees are fine.|`|4XgAtOTaaa	sometimes when i smoke to much my legs start to uncontrollably twitch/shake which sometimes leads to pain and i doubt what you're experiencing is all that different. no worries, though, it's probably nothing to seriously question. Different peoples bodies all react differently to things.
Q4ggnG0waa	Maybe once he found out you had an std, the thought of it made him puke...Just a thought.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	A bacterial, or yeast infection, likes a dark, moist, warm place to grow.  Be it a vagina or the human throat, its all the same to the disease.    Next time, be a friend and stick to kissing with lips.|`|tk2AOZU5aa	Yes, he can get oral thrush. Other than that, he shouldn't get sick from you unless you have something else going on down there...|`|0kWkX8yiaa	my bf did the same exact thing.. i had a bladder infection and he gave me oral and was very sick the next day. i doubt it had any relation though because we think it was food poisoning..considering i didn't get sick either...but i don't know..that is a good question haha|`|Hv9hGUdqaa	yes probally
AA10003191	Sorry, but no.    It's not the KNOWN patients that I worry about. It's the one's that DON'T know that they are +.     Being careful with technique and treating EVERY patient as if they were positive is the only way. If patient 'A' doesn't have a + HIV test, most people tend to relax their technique. Then the mistakes happen.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	nope. you should treat every patient like they have hiv and be extremely cautious with everyone. people living w hiv have enough drama and stigma|`|GUEsVdaFaa	It may go against the doctor/patient confidentiality thing. You might bring it up to your doctor and ask him if you can know but be sure to explain that it's a health concern for you. However, if you're properly using the safety precautions (gloves, sterile needles, antiseptic wipes etc.) you shouldn't have any worries. You really can only catch these things by coming into contact with their blood. If you're wearing the gloves that's not very likely to happen.|`|eVYXCvinaa	I work in health care also and have asked this question before.  Apparently we do not need to be aware of the patients HIV status because we are always suppose to use universal precautions, but in my case I have almost always been informed.  There have only been a few occasions in which I was not.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Considering your job, I do agree that you SHOULD know a patient's status.  However, by law, a patient's HIV status can not be released to ANYONE without the patient's written permission (unless the patient decides to tell you himself or herself.)     Use universal precautions (which you should be doing anyway, even if you know someone is NOT infected), and follow proper procedures if you ever do get a needle stick (report it to your supervisor, get tested, etc.)|`|Hv9hGUdqaa	well u could probally no wat ur giving themand u should be able to look at thier charts|`|Bvvt6QlLaa	i think you do have the right because you should be able to protect your self and the other patients who are in you office|`|aosNHXC3aa	I can tell you right now....you SHOULD have the right to know...but NO you DO NOT have the right to know you just need to use universal precautions....sorry

dewaqzgPaa	Abnormally fast heart beats can be dangerous if left untreated for too long. You should take his pulse, here is how. Find his pulse in his wrist, and count how many beats you get in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by 4 and that is his heart rate. If it is in the nineties, or up and he's not doing anything, it could be a blood pressure problem. But dont get to freaked out, he may just have a faster heart rate, than others. If you are truly worried about it, take him to the doctor and try and get him referred to a cardiologist (heart doctor).|`|KDst9z5Naa	That is not that normal . he needs to see a cardiologist and ask for a ecco test to check the heart . It is important that he gets checked out early before it becomes a real problem.|`|fAcVndo7aa	How fast is "really fast"?  100 beats a minute?  150?  Has he told his doctor?  What does his doctor say?    An abnormal heart beat can be a problem itself, or it can be a symptom of a bigger problem.  There's just not enough information in your question to give an intelligent answer.|`|98BZdVGJaa	if hes breathing-its finee.|`|IMwLfHQvaa	he's not dead yet so HAY?|`|kFEx2Bx0aa	resting heart rate should be around 70, lower if you exercise alot.  tell him to get a referral to a cardiologist, or just plain tell his pcp.  heart issues are nothing to mess around with. good luck...and stop taking drugs if you are, that's one reason why they're not good for you.|`|fGe968rZaa	well maybe he was born with some kind of disease, but other than that, i would go and see a doctor to check it out. cause that doesnt really seem normal.|`|nYgxqRBraa	he's probably high.|`|sdYoRJnUaa	Uhhh, if its that fast that your scared and looking for help online why the hell havent you gone to a doctor.  Abnormal heart beats can be dangerous, fately dangerous.|`|Mdv5lv8haa	tak is bood pressure....tats a sign of high bloo pressre|`|FjdU3gzpaa	Explains it all...    on drugs..  be careful.  watch out!|`|wntdMR8caa	yahoo answers is not a place for medical advice. just check it out at the doctors make sure to ask it next time he goes for a physical. its always good to go for check ups anyway because there is always a possibility of high blood pressure/ cholesterol in even the youngest of people nowadays.|`|CNCORjz6aa	GO TO A DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.|`|mFDnxCCeaa	mine is like that too and im only 105 lbs.  itz pretty normal  he jus has a faster heartrate than normal ppl  just avoid overworking it|`|HqLrSgBvaa	um ya your heartbeats are suppossed to go fzast|`|kDAIF09Jaa	It is a condition called Cardiac arrhythmia, nothing to worry about. the only really bad thing is an abnormal awareness of the heart beat.|`|YLsPYyi9aa	it is normal if he was born like that, its only because his heart pumps a lot of amount of blood|`|Tw5BP4Z8aa	All his life??? Has he ever gone to a doctor? It's obviously a problem so take him to the doctor... Damn|`|Bvvt6QlLaa	cheak his pulse first off if its in the 60-100 range then he's ok. when you get into the 90's range it does seem pretty fast but it's normal. one thing that could cause it to be beating so fast is if he drinks or eats alot of caffeine. so i would just suggest checking it before worrying about anything.
TORBP6QIaa	Thats excellent that you feel great...    If you take medication for your blood like Coumadin/Warfarin or Plavix , Clopidigel etc...you will probably be excluded from donating as they change the way the blood clots and this is not desirable to patients who are receiving a blood transfusion.    Maybe you can place yourself on the organ donation list instead so you can hopefully still donate something that will help/save a life if something tragic ever happens to you.|`|0xFQj585aa	There shouldn't be a problem donating blood, but you can call the blood bank first to check - protocols vary depending on where you live.|`|OuYPy2Ihaa	If you are on no medications, maybe.    The Red Cross will ask you about 15 or so questions, and let you know if they can accept your blood.|`|TjN43f0jaa	Yes you can give blood as long as you are off any blood thinning meds for 5days before giving blood that is so that your blood will clot|`|2N4j1ficaa	did you get blood? if so not aloud now .. but the stent in its self shud poses no problem ? or do you take blood thinners ....
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Use a tampon and a pad.|`|AA10378447	Try the pads labeled "overnight" for a heavier flow, and they're also longer. One thing that I used to do it put a panty liner on the back of the pad, nearly to the end. Then, lay the pad in it's usual position over the top of it. The panty liner gives you some extra protection up your backside. It sort of feels like a diaper, but it's good for sleeping when you're rolling in the bed, and it's better than getting that surprise on the sheets in the morning. Just more protection.    EDIT: You *can* also wear a tampon, I agree. You would have to get one of the brands that have the extra Super (as in thin/light, regular, super and extra large super) in order to sleep in it at night without having the risk of TSS from not changing it in the middle of the night, AND for protection of leakage. So, wear the tampon with either a panty liner or a pad as well.|`|8oRGz4Anaa	Large overnight pads, If you can use tampons than use a tampon and a pad, put an old sheet underneath you, try and lay more up than straight down so the blood goes in one spot, set your alarm clock to change it at night|`|dSZTdU56aa	Tampons.|`|CS3W706xaa	my friend wares tampons when she sleeps and she hasn't had any problems as long as you change the tampons right when you wake up|`|5Ra5xbziaa	maybe you can sleep on a towel or use overnight pads|`|GaYLCY1Waa	get the huge maxi pads with wings! or maybe wear more than one pad!|`|VQs0adT8aa	Try a Moon Cup or Keeper.  They're safe to sleep in and should prevent leaks if worn correctly.|`|cLSdkHZOaa	oh gosh i used to have that problem. use a really thick pad might help. i had to start using tampons to solve that problem. they take awhile to get used to but trust me, they are alot more convenient and less messy! good luck!|`|2DVr4C5Baa	where tight fitted underwear!! and two pads!
dSZTdU56aa	No.  The only time you have to wait an entire week is the very first week you start taking the pills.  After that, you can have sex whenever you want.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Taking birth control pills will not alway protect you from getting pregnant.  Unprotected sex breeds sexually tranmitted diseases as well as pregnancy.  I just hope you are well educated in having unprotected sex.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You are protected is you have taken the pills for a whole month.  The second month, there is no need to wait, provided you did not miss any pills.    Good luck!

You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Well, because that's how life is.  If you keep trying, then you haven't lost. Pick yourself back up again and try to see the problem from a different angle and come at it in a new way.|`|vJxuWyueaa	You're right. No one is perfect, and no one ever will be. Let's put it this way: If everyone in the world were to quit trying, then doctors/scientists would stop trying to find a cure for cancer and AIDs, Teachers wouldn't even bother to teach us anymore, no one would go to work anymore, and the world would be chaos! My point is, no matter how many times you fail, you must keep trying, or you will never live a happy life.
eY0MhGfmaa	bbrc is right about melatonin. You really should try it.    Also, have a cup of chamomile or other herbal tea with a little honey about 30 minutes before bedtime.

Used to be 5'7 230 pounds now im 5'10 190 pounds.  im 15 as well, at our age our skin stretches as we lose weight so you wont have hanging skin or anything.  You'll see that you don't bruise as easily though.  it wont make you look older so you can chill on that one.  Hey if your really that fat you can lose a lot of water weight and look better, which could boost your self esteem  Find a girl you like maybe, she will motivate you to get your fat *** into motion and work off some pounds  Just cut down on any fatty stuff your eating  Look at the percents on the back of stuff your eating, follow those loosly you can go over a bit or under a bit its all good  Just jump on a treadmill and lift some light weights with high repetitions.  Find motivation, i dunno if your like some people but think "Wow if i get a nice body, it will fit my personality and i can get some pussah"  You know what im saying?  Take it easy work hard. Peace :)  Hey i wanna call ivy a idiot :P just putting it out there  EDIT AGAIN:  I wanna call anyone saying that he will have sagging anything  a retard because its not true.  Maybe if hes gifted he will have some stuff sagging but other than that it wont  EDIT:  LOL yea im pretty big, but i have a gut and man thighs too bro. I got pics if you really don't believe me  Fiber helps but not too much of it  Hey add me on msn i like helping people that are like me lol  tatornoob@hotmail.com  EDIT:  When you lose weight you will grow bigger but i dont know if youll ever reach past 5'6 you never know though|`|hm4rnN7Paa	Nooooo your skin will not sag or be wrinkley at all! Youre still young so your skin can stretch and shrink very easily and quickly. The only time that your skin will sag once you lose weight is if youre way older and youve always, always been overweight.|`|BWicRmbLaa	It all depends on age, how much you have to lose, etc. If you already have stretch marks and have a large amount of weight to lose (say, for example, 100+lbs) then yes, theres a chance that you'll have excess skin. However everyone is different. To help buy some collagen elastin at the store or I got this product by Nivea, called "Skin Firming Moisturizer" that helps alot by making the skin tighter and more resiliant. I'd recommend you also tone up while you lose weight to tighten up! Good Luck, remember, you're not alone.|`|I54KyS8Laa	Take supplemental zinc to keep your skin from creating stretch marks.     A few tips--first most overweight people are addicted and at the same time allergic to diet soda. In fact diet soda and diet foods actually cause you to gain weight--the opposite of what they lead you to believe. Water is the best drink. If you want flavor use lime, lemon or squeeze an orange. Next liquefy real fruit with or without ice. And for goodness sake, stay away from any kind of carbonated beverages including club soda or seltzer--the carbonation destroys your calcium balance which will reek havoc on your metabolism. These are just a couple tips like you'll find at http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...  where you will find another twenty-five great free tips.   Apply those tips--they cost nothing and you'll be surprised to see the pounds start rolling off. And then if you want your weight loss to be permanent you might look at some of the resources below|`|m7putYGmaa	if you lose a drastic amount of weight very very quickly, then yeah your skin will sag, but if it happens gradually, your skin will eventually tighten up.. if you want to keep your skin elastic while losing weight, just moisturize it more often, with any lotion, coco butter helps, takes lots of vitamin e too! =D|`|Rufjboqcaa	you should probably ask a trainer.  if you get a membership at the ymca (at mine anyways) they let you have one for free for like 6 months.  they would know what workouts would be best and what would happen to skin and stuff.  or you could ask a doctor.  honestly, i think those would be your best options because they would know your body type, etc.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	If you do things drastically like starving yourself, throwing yourself into a 2 hour a day 7 days a week workout regime with diet pills (none of this is recommended by the way) then yes, your skin will sag. However, if you are comfortable losing weight slowly but gradually, your skin will stay elastic enough to where it isn't a problem. Make sure you shower after every workout (even if it is just enough to barely make you sweat) and use firming (but moisturizing) lotion, you will be fine.|`|uIzmBj9gaa	You are young. I went from 210 pounds down to 112 at your age and I was not saggy. I didn't start exercising until I was 150 pounds, either. Also, I lost the weight very fast by starving myself--just under 100 pounds in just over a year. Unfortunately, I have gained just over half the weight back. =(  So unless you are well over 300 pounds, I would say sagging will be basically zero.    Edit: a little extra fiber will probably help. But if you're eating enough fruits and vegetables, you may not need it.
tU5NJVL3aa	You won't die from that -- it's not unusual for those with irregular periods ot have heavy clotting when they have a heavy flow, especially when it's delayed a bit (more tendency to clot).

dSZTdU56aa	No, due to confidentiality they can not tell your parents if you've had sex.    However, if you have a STD, that might be different.  There are federal laws protecting your privacy rights at the doctor.    And no, they won't be able to tell unless you tell them.  Some girls think that they will know because the hymen is gone, but many girls break them with fingers,tampons, sports, etc.    If you're mature enough to have sex, you should be mature enough to discuss it with your parents.  What if you get pregnant?  What if you get an STD? It's not worth sneaking around behind your parents back.  They will most likely be more angry with you for keeping this from them, then they would if you acted like an ADULT and told them what was happening.    Best of luck to you.|`|GaYLCY1Waa	yes they can probably tell that you've had sex! but just tell your mom that you feel more comfortable with her not being in the room with you while you're being examed. then the doctor will ask you questions and you can ask her anything! it will all be in private because of patient doctor confidentiality rules. good luck!|`|er8hefmSaa	they wont be able to tell if you have, unless you have some kinda of disease. (AIDS) or (HIV).|`|5Kt8qlytaa	It depends on your state and the laws in that state.  Most states, ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Your doctor cannot tell your parents anything about your visit.  When includes if they put you on birth control.  The GYNO will be able to tell if you've had sex, but due to privacy laws this info will be confidential.  Your doctor is one person you can trust.|`|WIYWJwqcaa	no, they canNOT tell that you've had sex before... you DO need to be truthful with your gyno so he/she knows if you should be tested for anything... sometimes they keep info confidential but since you're 15 they might tell your parents..
dSZTdU56aa	I get light drops of blood a few days before my period starts.  It will come soon.|`|AA10378447	Probably just some pre AF spotting. It's normal.|`|tMghXutuaa	It's normal I get the same thing.

fAFXkikAaa	Most people with genital herpes get no symptoms at all - even though they can infect other people.  So just because you don't have symptoms, it doesn't mean that you don't have genital herpes.    If you are going to have a "classic" initial outbreak - which is not just genital sores, but also body aches, fever, etc - then you will usually get it between 2 days and three weeks after exposure.    But many people don't get a "classic" initial outbreak.  Your first outbreak might be weeks, months, or even years after you first contract herpes.    I wish I had a more definitive answer for you - but herpes outbreaks are different for each person.    If you think you've been infected, then I would  a) be on the lookout for genital sores.   Many people miss their first herpes outbreak because they think that they scratched themselves, or that they have razor burn.  If you feel sores on your genitals, go to the doctors.  b) if you haven't had any symptoms in a couple of months, go get a blood test.  Even if you were infected, its takes several weeks before your body will have enough antibodies for a blood test to be meaningful.    For a lot of good, reliable, easy-to-read information about herpes, I recommend the website below.    Good luck.|`|fk9AvB25aa	The usual time for herpes to break out is between 2-14 days but it could take longer then that to feel symptoms. Your body can suppress the virus for months or even years after you contract it.  Some people only experience mild symptoms that can feel and look like a rash of small pimples, while others get the full out classic symptoms of an out break with lots of blisters or sores. I had all of the classic symptoms including feeling like I had the flu on my first out break.
xF7XLRQzaa	Vitamin C...   Very effective.|`|MjlsjAYaaa	I have found that doing yoga improves your immunity.     However, if you already have a cold, try to wash your hands as often as possible. Also, drink lots of water and avoid touching your nose, eyes to avoid the spreading of infection. You could also gargle with saline solution. Try to take vitamin tablets just so that you are not weak and easily susceptible to infections in the future.|`|8nOjM549aa	take some airborne|`|N7SJgwm2aa	drink alot of orange juice it help me alot to prevent a cold or just put on a flu shoot.

vJxuWyueaa	If you were both virgins, then there is no way you have gotten an STD.|`|sK9kDAtLaa	YOURE FINE!|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Well that's something you don't read around here every day! I guess congratulations are in order.     STD's... well one of you has to have a disease to pass it on.     Some diseases (STD's) can be contracted in ways other than through sex... HIV+ for example can be contracted by blood transfusion, needle stick injury or from mother's milk. You say you used protection and that's very sensible. Just so as you know, some STD's like syphalis can be transmitted by coming in to contact with the sores or rash.. etc... which may not be located on the genitals... kissing an infected partner for example.     Anyway, I'm sure you are probably completely healthy.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Not if both of you were virgins and used protection.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	hope you used two different rubbers.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	I'm sorry but these people are wrong. If you gave each other oral then there is in fact the possibility that you could have gotten STDs. If either of you have ever had a cold sore, this is oral herpes and you can give it to a partner genitally through oral. It's true, look it up if you don't believe me.    However, in all likelihood, you probably have nothing. You really shouldn't worry.    As far as serious STDs like HIV, it's impossible.|`|suBNmjONaa	i think you will be fine dude..you said you are both virgins, so unless by some force of god, one of you were blessed with an STD, i think your penis will stay in tact|`|eed1TdWsaa	how cute... naw your fine. if she is a virgin the only std she could have is HIV & she would've had to be born with it...unlikely, more in more danger of making out with her & getting a cold sore.    & because yall used condoms there is no chance of pregnancy     as long as yall stay monogamous the is no real chance of SDT...good luck & lots of fun to ya    cheers|`|sZYOg61Baa	no not unless she lied and she has had sex before|`|oUdo4kBYaa	depends if she was a hunter|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	if you are both virgins and both used protection, the odds of an STD are very unlikely....though its possible if either of you have done oral or had some genital contact with other people in the past    when in doubt, go to the doctor

M5Sw5SWfaa	Starving could actually get you FATTER. Your metabolism slows down because you're not eating and when you eat again, your metabolism is still slow which means you could get fatter. Muscular legs are better than flabby legs~|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Don't starve yourself. You will be miserable and so will your stomach! Just eat fresh fruits and vegetables. that would be so much better.|`|dKRFpIvPaa	reduce your fat intake and increase the amount of water you drink.  you could also replace a meal with a special k bar.  i did that for two weeks and my legs slimmed down and my arms got toned (with dumbells of course)|`|496babd9168b78c6f24aaf5a21f9133caa	Nope don't do that. Im a athlete too but don't have that problem lol but you should know how to fix that woman. All you need to do is treadmill or bicycle would be real good. And do it on LOW levels and for a long time it'll make your thighs thinner. 2-3 level would be good. Do NOT increase your intensity level on those things bc that will make you build muscle. Not eating won't do anything accept make you make more fat cells that will make you harder to lose weight and stuff. bc when you don't eat for long and then do eat your body won't burn that and store as fat.|`|9kxbdoAmaa	Wow lots of people here advertising stupid **** that has nothing to do with the topic.  Anyhow just don't work your legs its simple or work your legs just do low weight and more reps they will become smaller but be able to contain more oxygen so you can run longer.  But stopping eating wont help, like at all lol   Whoever told you not to take fats to lose muscle is a tart cart  Muscles have nothing to do with fats, and unless u purposely eat alot of protein you dont need to decrease.  EDIT:  There's no such this as slow or fast metabolism.  Its how your body metabolizes
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.
lm0nlP04aa	I don't believe so.  But he can become a carrier of the virus and spread it if he sleeps with other women and doesn't use protection.|`|a6ff9f59e8aab5e4708f774467c8272faa	Cancer of the penis is linked to high risk HPV types.  These same high risk HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancer.  HPV is transmitted through sex and sex play.    Here in the US cancer of the penis is rare.  While the link with this cancer is HPV most men do not develop this cancer....even though they carry these high risk HPV types and can transmitted them to their sex partner...most often never knowing they carry the virus.    Your sex partner that had cervical cancer will not cause you to have cancer of the penis...but you will most probably acquire her HPV type.      Cancer of the penis is extremely rare in the U.S., affecting only about 1,500 men each year. The penile cancer rate is much higher among men in India and some South American countries.  M. D. Anderson treats about 30 cases of penile cancer each year, as compared to one case every two to three years treated by urologists outside a major cancer center. The larger patient volume allows M. D. Anderson urologists to obtain crucial data that can improve current treatments and develop new therapies.  The risks for penile cancer include:   Age: Most cases are seen in men aged 50-70, although nearly a third of cases occur in men under 50.   Smoking: Men who either chew or smoke tobacco are more at risk for penile cancer.  Human Papillomavirus (HPV): This sexually transmitted disease has more than a dozen subtypes. HPV 16 and HPV 18 are most frequently linked to penile cancer.  Lack of circumcision at birth: Studies have shown that penile cancer rates are higher in populations where circumcision is done later or not at all.   Phimosis: a condition in which it's difficult to pull back the foreskin, which can lead to the buildup of body oils, bacteria and other debris known as smegma.|`|uKvAXBBKaa	I don't think so.  Cancer is not contagious.
qnD5RfbPaa	Yes! This happens if they do not consume sufficient nutrients necessary for the increase of bone density.  These nutrients include Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, vitamin D (vitamin D is manufactured by the skin in the presence of sunlight) and other nutrients that interact to improve absorption, utilization of calcium and the production of bone cells to improve bone density.     Adult female also develop brittle bones because of the depletion of the hormone estrogen.

uKBJniEKaa	I use the Instead Softcup and I love it. I'll never use tampons again. Plus, unlike the Diva, you can have sex with it in (and he'll never know!)|`|qsjGiaW2aa	The diva cup is the best thing ive ever used! its not messy at all, its comfy and its very easy to remove. I sometimes forget im even wearing it! you should really consider getting it, i recommend it to everyone i know|`|VQNiLBQIaa	I own one :) I recommend the diva cup! I would change it more than 12 hrs, because you may overflow the cup! (depending on the flow of course). the first time i used it was a little intimidating, BUT once you get used to it you'll wonder why you didn't get it in the first place! You save SO MUCH money! Double check the "maintenance/cleaning" regime.... But I put mine in boiling water for 10 minutes after each period... and clean it with a mild soap and rinse it out each use. ENJOY! :D haha.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Ive used menstrual cups for around 6 years now, I started with Mooncup http://www.mooncup.co.uk and now use a Ladycup http://www.ladycup.com the Ladycup is pretty similar in shape to Divacup but a lot more flexible. I love menstrual cups, I suffer from excessively heavy periods back when using super-plus tampons and night time pads I would leak through those and my clothing within 15 minutes. Menstrual cups dont leak, I can feel when its full if I leave it there is some pink discharge, it takes a while before any blood leaves your body and even then its nothing compared to flooding from using tampons. You can put them in before your period to avoid mess, they can be worn with any flow so no need to change absorbency, plus they can be worn at night so you avoid uncomfortable pads or leaking at night. Health is the big issue as cups are hygienic and carry no health risks, I had constant infections from using tampons, but since switching to cups I havent had a single infection. I study sexual health, since making the switch Ive learned exactly how harmful tampons actually are and how often manufacturers have knowingly risked womens lives, Im so glad I made the switch. Then you have other plusses such as being far cheaper and better for the environment (preventing waste and harmful manufacturing), and the cup companies are great ethically, helpful and dont use menstrual taboos to try to sell more products.     Changing to cups isnt a problem as they are similar in size to tampons so if you can use tampons cups will be easier as they dont cause friction making them easier to insert as well as more comfortable. It can be difficult to adjust to the change, but it soon becomes second nature and really is so much easier, I remember my first time using a cup I totally panicked about removing it as I didnt see how it was possible. After that first time I had no problems at all, you just pinch the bottom of the cup, then pull out, empty and clean off. You can practice before your period or in the shower, once using them you dont have to worry about changing all the time, using different absorbencies, using pads as back-up or at night, carrying spares or leaking so they are far more convenient.     Yes they can be worn safely and hygienically for up to 12 hours because menstrual cups dont interfere with vaginal functions, they also dont encourage bacterial growth as there are no fibres, synthetics, additives, chemicals or bleach like within tampons. As there is little bacterial growth it means that they can be left in for longer periods of time as bacteria wont multiply like it would if within tampons, and as they hold more fluid they wont fill as fast as tampons or pads.     They arent messy at all, the only people who say otherwise are people who havent used them because they have issues with menstrual blood so are put-off by the idea of cups. What people dont understand is that cleaning isnt a big deal, even if you have to empty in a public bathroom (rarely happens) then just wipe it with tissue and itll still be more hygienic than using a tampon would be. I would say menstrual cups are far less messy than tampons or pads as they dont leak, yes you need to clean but just do that in the shower and there is no mess. Cups arent that much more hands-on than tampons either, you dont have to mess about wrapping up tampons to bin them or deal with leaking, and the blood stays in the cup until you empty it out.    You might want to check out the menstrual cup support community http://www.menstrualcups.org if you look under 'memories' on the right-hand side of the page you will find loads of entries about menstrual cups, things like tips, experiences, reviews, and lots of useful stuff.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Ooohh, I heard of the DivaCup and was actually going to buy one but I can't cause I don't think they sell it where I live!    Have you gone on their Website?    www.divacup.com    Yes, you apparently can leave it in for 12 hours! Oxygen can't get to the blood because the plastic cup is blocking it, so your won't smell or anything. It's also very clean, because it's simply a piece of plastic and nothing else. It's made of soft silicone, and it apparently gets really soft while you use it because your bodyheat warms it up.    Search "Has anyone tried DivaCup" in the Yahoo Answers Searchbar - you'll find a lot that will help you :)    I hope I helped :)
21f607e2a108c7e5f56649beeb4de243aa	Okay, it always helps to drink HOT -not iced- tea. Also, if you have a steam machine, that's great, if not, take hot showers, and breathe in the steam if you can. If not, then breathe it in through your mouth until you nose begins to clear up. Blow your nose once it gets running, and them breathe in more steam. Drink the tea as often as possible, and eat a lot of hot broth (chicken noodle soup, etc). It also helps if you wash your sheets every 3-4 days if it continues. Colds are a simple illness that can easily be taken care of. Your throat will heal up as you drink the tea, use honey, and not sugar. The honey helps your throat (I forgot how, but it does). Hope you feel better soon.

Ke0oWj4oaa	Hey:)    Well, I'm going to assume that as a junior you are able to drive, or have access to a friend or the bus. I'd look up health clinics, borrow your health insurance card from your parents (or just take it, or say it is for a job interview or something of that nature). There are many health clinics, and since you are older than 16 many will accept you and try to perscribe you the right pills/help..although, most places will be reluctant w/o parental control. Your counselor will help, and as long as you don't mention harming yourself or others (drugs, suicide, extreme anger) he won't tell. And don't worry about the paperwork, or finding a clinic, it's easy, I've been doing it since I was 11:P So, you should have no problems. Or..talk with a relative, it'll be hard, but I did recently, and I feel sooo much better.|`|iF92Q2f3aa	Brian and help have good suggestions.

I don't know if this is your case though.    So what you need to do is talk to him and tell him how you feel and what you want to do.  If you want to work than tell him that you are too tired to cook and clean on those days.     If you want to cook and clean though you need to tell him that work tires you out too much.    Either way you need to sit him down and talk to him directly.    If he still wont listen than I would suggest couples counseling.
q1GnMRxxaa	The court can make it mandatory for you to take a medication. They can and do check up on you if need be. Of course no one can force you to take your medication, but they sure can say if you don't take it, then we can put you in jail. I know this because a dear friend had to take his medication as part of his probation and this was for domestic violence. He was not on his medication when he did the violence. Since then, he is doing perfect and got his sentence reduced to a misdemeanor too. BTW, this person never was sent to a hospital and he had a record of the mental illness on his charts. To check if you are taking your medication, they can do a blood test or even check by a urine test too, but only if they find it necessary to do so (like if they suspect that your not taking it). My friend only had urine test in the beginning. After that, no more tests because he did follow the rules.|`|HtRLnntRaa	I know they can force you to take medication if your sectioned, and they don't need a court order. But you only get sectioned if your a risk to your own life or others.    This is in the UK by the way.    If your sectioned they force them down your throat.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	In the US, typically it's illegal to force someone to take meds, especially anti-pyscotics since the side effects can be serious (from my understanding). They can use it as part of an agreement, i.e. you can't have your kids back unless you take your meds, everyday, or something like that.    They can do blood tests to check the levels, or some make them come into a clinic daily and take the meds, but as I said, it's pretty much illegal to force someone to take meds.

MeOOUhHkaa	Well, I have a hearing disability, though a small one, and the audiologist kept pressuring me to get hearing aids, though I flat out refused and told them I would smash them if they made me get them.    So, they gave in and said my hearing wasn't THAT bad, and I didn't REALLY need that bad, so I got off.    I have had speech therapy, and that wasn't so bad. Mostly, they would use mirrors and make us practice how we shaped our lips and moved our tongues when we talked.     My teacher's granddaughter had gotten cochlear implants though and they made a world of difference to her. I think if she needs it, then do it.    Hearing aids can be a bit ehh, because I will admit I was horrified that I would have to use them, and there is a chance of them being lost, or damaged or ruined.|`|KsgdRHfNaa	there is girl in my daughters girl scout troop who uses a hearing aid to speak. she cant hear spoken words to well, so the hearing aid helps her ear break down the different letter sounds easier so she can repeat them. shes about 10 years old and she seems to be just fine with it. hope all is well =D|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	Sorry, I don't have the experience you're asking for. I'm interested in the question because I study ASL and have a couple of Deaf friends.    My good friend who is Deaf uses hearing aids, and she can read lips as well as sign, and she can talk really well. She uses the hearing aids for kind of ambient noise, and to aid her in reading lips (sometimes in a crowded room, she'll say "I can't hear you" and we'll go to a quieter place).    I think the decision for a lot of people is about culture. Many people are skeptical of the cochlear implant, because it implies that being Deaf or Hard of Hearing is a disability, rather than a state of being. The Deaf community is sometimes slow to accept people with cochlear implants as opposed to hearing aids. I could be wrong but that is what I have observed and learned through my education in Deaf studies.
mhLaOFZRaa	You don't give your age but if you are a teen or preteen your body is going through many hormonal changes. It can happen right before or during your monthly time.    If you are a teen you might want to talk with your mom, grandmother, aunt or guardian as they need to be aware of any of your health concerns so they can get you a medical checkup if there is a problem.
HRvPoQzKaa	My friend had a huge argument with our ex best friend and her neck was red and blotchy because she was pissed off and stressed.    I don't know if it will never come back but try not to be really nervous. If you start to get nervous then calm down. Go to a bathroom and splash water on your face.
C0sT0PPyaa	xrays don't tell anything about need injurys because knees are cartialge and ligaments not bone.  you would need an mri.  ligaments take 6 months to heal so maybe you didn't rest and rehab it enough.  if there is no popping and locking id say you just have some week muscles and need some flexability rehab to find the weaknesses and make them stronger so your knee isn't taking weird pressures.  ice the swelling because more scar tissue makes for an injurus knee|`|3enJVNDdaa	sounds like arthritis
rHwMf2P4aa	Sorry but staph infections are bad and need antibiotic treatment.  How did your mom diagnose it as staph.  I really doubt it is a staph infection.  My advice is to keep it really clean and put antibiotic ointment on it.  Sounds to me like a pimple or most likely an ingrown hair.  My sister is an RN and she helped answer this question.  Staph infections if move deeper past the skins surface is deadly.  Most common in the elderly, people recently hospitalized and people with low immune systoms (like people with cancer or aids)  It is an infection that is very hard to cure since most staph infections are antibiotic resistance.  Unless you are one of these people YOU DON'T HAVE STAPH ON YOUR KNEE!  Look up the mayo clinic website and search staph.  Theres a pic. I saw that could be what your describing, but IDK.  If so weather you have insurance or not you cannot cure it on your own and to save your life you need medical intervention.  I'm not trying to be a b****, but get yourself checked out since your convinced it is staph.  If it is you don't have a choice. -christine's sis (RN for 7 years with ICU and ER experience)|`|8SKpsVG7aa	take a bath|`|Hv9hGUdqaa	stay home i had impetego its a type of staph infection it is REALLY contagous|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Staph is a VERY serious infection.  The ONLY way to treat it is by taking antibiotics prescribed by a doctor.  See your doctor to find out if it is staph or another type of infection, (How do you know it is staph?), and take antibiotics exactly as your doctor prescribes.  If you don't, the infection could spread and cause more problems.|`|4BoteYDwaa	Ok this only works if your not allergic to iodine. Take a clean rag and put some Povidone-Iodine Solution on it (equate brand works well), then leave it on there until it's dry.  If you have to, wrap another layer around this to keep it from dripping, the iodine will stain anything it touches so don't use any rags or towels that your fond of. Never used the same rag twice, wash them in bleach or heavy detergent, or just throw them out. Once it's dry, take shower and rinse it off thoroughly, what this does is dry out the infection. You'll have to do this for several days because the infection may be deep. This is kinda a last resort, but it does work
h3rN7snkaa	Salad isn't always the best diet food.   Heres a better meal plan:    Breakfast- EAT It! lol this is the meal that gets your metabolism going so you can burn more calories, try a bannana and cereal, yogurt and toast, eggs and lean sausage. All good ideas.     Lunch- cut the salads.... try a sandwhich (Turkey, chicken, lean roast beef) with one slice of cheese mustard, veggies. Yougurt, baked chips, some meat, cheese, and crackers, maybe a salad AND piece of fruit or somthing else with it. Lunch is pretty open for whatever you want to eat     Dinner- Try to eat the least at this meal. Soup and whole what toast is great, Small peice of chicken with veggies, stuff like that.     Drink lots of water! Switch to skim milk (fat free)....keep at the exercise!   In addition to that you could try a dance class......girls will love! Believe me, and its great exercise for good bodys.   Good luck!|`|xlxZV0Xsaa	try wii fit. it helps you be in shape and it helps you lose weight at the same time. you could also play lots of fun games while exercising. you could play with family and friends.|`|ArkfFTuLaa	Acai rips you off, they charge you 90$ every month after you order the free trial, don't even bother looking into it!  What your doing sounds great! I would just suggest jogging more. Jogging is the main weight loss solution. It burns a lot of calories and once you get used to doing it, you'll WANT and NEED to go out for a jog. Jump rope is also a great calorie burner. Jogging for 30 minutes a day would also help you out a lot.  Good luck!
QBUypAmAaa	Ah, yes ouch, I've had personal experience with this one. For one, NEVER masturbate with soap as it will dry your skin out and give you that flaky horrible burn that you are experiencing now. If you do masturbate with soap always make sure to thoroughly clean your penis afterward, as the agents within soap dry the penis.    However, luckily you have nothing to worry about, except for the discomfort of your situation. When it happened to me, what I did was get a bag and put my penis in it (a plastic sandwich bag like ziploc would work perfectly), wearing it at all times so that my penis would not get irritated by the contact with my clothing. The smoothness of the plastic will be enough for your skin's sensitive state to handle and you should feel no pain at all. If the bag slips, go to the restroom and secure it around your penis once more, also it would probably be best to wear briefs while you are wearing the bag around your penis as it will help to prevent slippage. Also don't forget to change your bag everyday.    During the week your penis will itch from time to time, but do not scratch it, this is the dead skin cells being sloughed off to make room for the new healthy cells. When you remove the bag to shower or use the bathroom, you'll notice flakes in the bag, this is just the dead burned skin cells falling off as the new healthy skin cells are taking the old ones places. Unfortunately these flakes and your penis during your recovery time will be a bit on the smelly side, because those burned skin cells are dead and decaying. You'll also notice your penis is starting to peel, this is normal, and do not peel off the skin that is flaking. After about a week, you should be healed up enough to wear your clothes without the bag around your penis, which means you're pretty much healed up.    Just remember next time to masturbate with something less abrasive, never use soap, go for lotions, baby oils, and vaseline, or even water if none of the others are available.    Sorry to hear you had to come across this, as it really is so uncomfortable and painful. But you'll be fine, just do what I described and you'll be better in no time.|`|suBNmjONaa	yeah, that probably definately most likely has quite a bit to do with it.. the reason it is called hand soap, is because it is meant for your hands..the ph levels are probably not compatible with the sensitive skin of the penis..try using lotion next time..|`|hphruXBsaa	soap did it.|`|eueWF7WDaa	yeah, like the ppl above me said, there's a reason guys keep lotion next to the bed rather than DIAL. lol. You just have to chalk it up as a lesson learned the hard way... it should get better in a few days.|`|215e8f63a273a9d5cbab203c741c8cecaa	Don't ever lube up with soap. The wax residue from the soap irritates your skin.  It gives you that burning sensation as it dries your skin out and clogs your pores, which can eventually lead to zits on your penis.  There are some nice masturbation creams out there such as these http://www.cheaplubes.com/index.asp?Page... but you can also use ordinary hand lotion. Just don't use soap of any kind.|`|xK6wehG7aa	it's due to a condition called bulbous mangina. I'd contact your doctor.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Perhaps it was slightly flammable, and you were so exhausted that when you finished you fell asleep with a cigarette in your mouth, which fell into your lap, roasting your weenie.|`|dWFyBJSKaa	the soap got into your penis hole. give it time to go away. use water or lube to masturbate, not soaps that can cause pain|`|cr2KKT6Naa	stop with the soap. get some lotion,vasiline, butter, lips,vagina,|`|vpoP8ksHaa	owwwwwwwwwww    smart move man!    dont do that again ay    im sure itll be fine soon, just...give it a rest ;)

Hope this helps!|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Call your credit card company and tell them the circumstances and that you are disputing the charges.  You won't have to pay for anything you haven't ordered.

That's where they make their money - people forgetting to cancel before the trial period is up. It's not a scam, technically. You just messed up and didn't cancel.|`|m7S61eNEaa	I am sorry to say this but yes this is a scam. I work for credit card company and we see a lot of complaints about this offer. Unfortunately because they have been given your card details they are authorized to take payments, this was probably explained in the small print when you signed up to the offer. There are 3 numbers for the company to call: 1-800-989-5907, 1-866-449-5567, 1-866-363-0187. They are only american numbers though so it may be pricey. Contact your card company to see if they can help you what we recommend is to block your card as lost and get a new one sent out as the company will then no longer have your card details and dispute any transactions that the company have put through, they tend to use your details to sign you up to other membership sites this is also mentioned in the small print though so is not classed as fraud. I hope this gets resolved for you.|`|a9SYkDgUaa	Be careful of scams.

Talk to your doctor about your situation. Good luck|`|8ebace53ced50f1918907901847f7907aa	Hi there,  First I would like to say that I am sorry that you are going through this. It can be very frustrating and exhausting. I know exactly what you go through, I have always had extremely painful periods, to the point of passing out and throwing up. I also am a very heavy bleeder and I can hardly get out of bed, even after taking prescription pain killers. I am sorry that the gyn you saw said it was normal, unfortunately this is all too common. I thought it was normal for a long time too, sweety it isn't. My regular doctor told me it was normal too, leaving me very confused and angry. Trust me please, this is not normal. I am not trying to scare you, but I was just recently diagnosed with a condition called Endometriosis and it sounds like you could possibly have it.  Here are some of the symptoms, which you don't have to have all of them to have Endo.  * Pain, which can be:  o Pelvic pain.  o Severe menstrual cramps.  o Low backache 1 or 2 days before the start of the menstrual period (or earlier), becoming less during the period.  o Pain during sexual intercourse.  o Rectal pain.  o Pain during bowel movements.  * Infertility, which may be the only sign that you have endometriosis. Between 20% and 40% of women who are infertile have endometriosis.1  * Abnormal bleeding. This can include:  o Blood in the urine or stool.  o Some vaginal bleeding before the start of the menstrual period (premenstrual spotting).  o Vaginal bleeding after intercourse.    I would definitely find a new gyn to see. I hope that this helps you and that you start to feel better soon. If you have any more questions or need anything, just shoot me an email.
t7zuFsdwaa	Keep an eye on this and if the pain or tingling continues it may be the beginning of DVT. A vascular surgeon can perform a Doppler ultra scan test and identify the problem.    This is very painful and pain pills do not help. I have had it for over 2 years and the doctor was slow to diagnose it until I was in critical shape.    Mine started with a sudden onset of calf pain and leg swelling. The pain was worse when the leg was hanging down. There was warmth to the area because the veins were inflamed.    I am on coumidin (warfarin) as a blood thinner. Usually when they say 6 months, they mean for the rest of your life. The blood thinner does not resolve the current clot problem, but supposedly keeps new clots from forming.    Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is caused by a blood clot in a muscle and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and tenderness in the legs. Risk factors include immobility, hormone therapy, and pregnancy.     DVTs can occur anywhere in the body but are most frequently found in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, and pelvis. They may infrequently arise from the upper extremities usually because of trauma, or from an indwelling catheter (tubing) or device.    A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition wherein a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein of the deep system.    Thrombophlebitis is a condition in which there is both inflammation and a blood clot in a vein. Thrombophlebitis can occur in either superficial or deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis occurs in veins close to the skin surface, and usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the area of the vein. Superficial thrombophlebitis usually is treated with heat, elevation of the affected leg or arm, and antiinflammatory medications. A thrombosis in a deep vein is a much more serious problem than one in a superficial vein. The reason for this is that a piece of the clot in deep vein from a DVT can break off and travel through the deep veins back to the heart, and eventually be pumped by the heart into the arteries of the lung. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE). The blood clot is called an embolus (plural emboli), and the process of breaking off and traveling to the lungs is called embolism.    Narcotics didnt help my pain. I now take Tizanidine 4mg 5/day and Lyrica Cv 100       mg 3/day. This helps the nerve pain and I can walk some now. I am feeling much better pain wise.

I2gMIWDeaa	It's perfectly normal and natural for one testicle to hang lower than the other.  Masturbation has nothing to do with this.  It's normal male anatomy.  It will not change, so relax.  As far as masturbation being healthy?  It is.  It's also normal.  You're 16 and you are getting to know your body.  Continue to explore it and all it's wonders.  You're fine.|`|YjuVJbxSaa	it means u could die but then again you could die in a ferris wheel accident too|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	It's not abnormal to have one testicle slightly larger than the other.  It's also possible you have what is called a hydrocele, which is sort of a water filled cyst.  That would cause one to shift up or down.  It's not life threatening, and doesn't need to be corrected unless it causes you problems.  I realize this would be embarrassing for you to consider, but a quick exam by your doctor will give you the answer you need from a person you can trust to know.   It has nothing to do with your masturbating at all, and you don't have to tell the doctor about that at all.   That's also a pretty normal activity for a teenage male.  The exam by the doctor may seem pretty personal to you, but the doctor won't think a thing about it.  In just a minute or so, it will all be done and over, and you will have your answer.  And probably feel a lot better than you do now.  It honestly sounds like you are more normal than you realize.  So breathe out, and consider seeing the doctor for confirmation.|`|FTRs5w3eaa	You are completely normal and have nothing to worry about. Most, if not all men, will have one slightly larger or hang slightly lower.    Here's a tip for you too: women typically have one breast that is larger than the other as well....unless they have had surgery.     The human body is NEVER perfectly symmetrical.|`|YJkT10aUaa	You are normal, there's one testicle that hangs lower then the other.

RoDjZKknaa	I'm not sure why you didn't wear the retainer when you first got it back or why you were not more specific with them about the gap?  If you can wear it now I would.  It might be painful at first but your teeth will eventually shift into their proper position and then you should be able to get by only wearing it at night.  If it doesn't fit now, you have the option of going back and getting a new one made and keeping your teeth where they are now OR do nothing and hope they don't shift back to where they were before you started your ortho.  Bottom line Retainers ARE important!|`|5jf5tcMnaa	After a year, will the retainer fit now?|`|CuceJCLxaa	i say yes i would help your teeth but yes it will be painful process since the retainer is smaller than your teeth but yes it will help them but if its too much pain to bear it will be better to go back to your ortho and get a new one.

fZCfJWpOaa	Well, since you had unprotected sex it is possible you're pregnant.  A pregnancy test should be able to read in one more week if the only time you have had sex was 2 weeks ago.    Those symptoms are not guarantees of pregnancy.  They could be PMS or indigestion.      Wait for a week to take the test.  If it's positive, get to a doctor.  There's prenatal vitamins and folic acid you need to be taking if you are going to keep the child.

So there is my tsk tsk.  Anyway, if the test is negative, don't sweat it.  If you are pregnant there's nothing you can do yet.  If not, your period will come and you will feel like a dork and be relieved.  If you are, your doctor will find out before putting an IUD in.  It'll all work out in the end. The longest you have to wait is only three weeks or so.

Sinusitis is often called a sinus infection that can be cleared up with antibiotics. It usually starts to go away after a few days of the antibiotics. To help relieve soem of that pressure int he mean while you can use saline spary. It is very cheap an can be bought at your local drug store. Sudafed helps also.

It's a human experience, sometimes stronger than at other times, that lets us handle life's experiences.  It gets us to slow down sometimes when we need to pay attention to something in our life that we don't see at first.  It changes our perspective so we can look at life from a different point of view.  To get panicky about it and go run to the doctor because you are taught to fear it is like destroying part of our body just because we don't think it looks its best for a while.  Calm down, take a deep breath or two, spend time examining your life, and see how you can make it better, without drugs / medicine, and then return to your normal level of functioning when you've got it figured out.  You'll do fine.  I promise you.  God Bless you.|`|r22addgJaa	It sounds like you are depressed. It could just be going through adolescence, but you sound depressed. Just take things one day at a time. I, too, am a perfectionist and got A's in school. I wasn't happy at your age either. But, things get better. It's part of growing up. Hang in there.|`|udPENhCxaa	Some depression while growing up is sort of normal. Its how you deal with it that changes things. Your 13, starting to become all that you can be as a person. After your teen years, you will slow down and start using what you have learned in many different tasks in life.     Take life one step at a time. Quit worrying about what others think and just be yourself. Sound simple? its not. Stand up and make others happy and you will be too. Good luck. And remember, "baby steps".|`|UMg1CL7baa	i think its just the time, i remember when i was in 8th grade i felt the exact same way, but just remember, it has to get worse before it can get better. I actually wanted to die, but i stopped myself, waited it out and now im happier than ever. Trust me, it will get better.|`|tkjBQOLeaa	Don't be so hard on yourself, this is definatly around the time when you are finding out who you are(and who your gonna be) and during that time you might experiance some alone time, dont feel bad, I use to be a (so called) "nerd" and alone at times, but now I have a family(husband & son who loves me) and a whole lot of friends, what I'm saying is during my "alone" time I found myself and became a happier person. Im not that so called "nerd" anymore...in fact I'm the "cool mom"
VCUc4k70aa	Hello there.  For my plaque psor. (elbows, knees and scalp) the herbal cream/spray combo by champori works the best: my patches cleared almost completely in just 2 weeks and I haven't had a flare up in more than a year now.  Try it: it comes with money back guarantee, so if it doesn't work - it's free.  Best,  Bernadette|`|U9vXvm9Iaa	You can buy a shampoo that helps keep the psoriasis under control.|`|UAnQuhBVaa	Try indoor tanning. I manage a tanning salon, and I have many clients come in to tan to help with their Psoriasis...not to mention, it is quite relaxing!|`|UO2FAgy6aa	Clobex Shampoo will be good for the psoriasis on your scalp. I think it would work behind your ears too, but I'm not sure. I believe it is a prescription drug, so you would have to go your dermatologist to get a prescription. They might have samples available at the dermatologist office too.
da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	Sounds more like stretch marks - try cocoa butter, vitamin e cream, vitamin k cream, etc etc.    They'll never completely go away but using all of the above will make them fade immensely.    Apparently there are so many people out there that have them.    I have a few on my shoulders that appeared a few years ago that have faded with the assistance of creams but are still there. Nobody really notices them but me.     The indents mostly go away, just a very shallow line, slightly lighter than your skin tone, remains eventually.    I KNOW though, sucks to have them, right?    Use of creams asap and even a doctors visit to confirm what they are will help them fade sooner rather than later.|`|rDO6iEh9aa	sounds like stretch marks to me. nothing you can do about that. sometimes just the growing out of our skin, literally, will cause stretch marks.|`|0k9IJYS1aa	i have it    sound like stretchmarks     it's like a disease  it spread to other part too.     i tried all the cream. rite now i'm using cocoa palmer tummy butter  not sure if its working
AA11388527	Did you bang your hand against something earlier today or yesterday?  Might possibly be a hematoma.  That's not serious.  It's really hard to speculate without being able to see it.  As long as it isn't painful or increasing in size, just monitor it.  Try a warm compress for a couple of days.|`|Hv9hGUdqaa	its called a spider vein|`|95305a595de7cbc914577df5969ece1faa	i dont wanna  sound mean but GO TO THE FREAKIN DOCTOR!! thts 1 thing tht bugs me is tht ppl ask health questions on here tht they could figure out and they'd no it'd b right if they'd go to their dr. it could b a cyst. if u hit it recently it could just b swelled but id get it checked just in case.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Take 1/2 an aspirin and use damp heat on it.

RoDjZKknaa	How long has it been since you have seen a dentist?  If the bits that break off are brown that sounds like tarter build up. Do you floss your teeth and get regular dental cleanings?    If not you probably need a very thorough cleaning. good luck|`|5jf5tcMnaa	What you are describing is known as Abfraction.  The force of your bite causes some flexing of you tooth.  As the tooth flexes the hard but brittle enamel chips at the neck of the tooth at the gumline area.  The broken area can be repaired with some white composite fillings.  But the bite force on the tooth must be reduced or the tooth will continue to break and the filling will pop out etc.  So the tooth will need to have some of the contact on it from the opposing tooth, ground away.  Oh, and since you might be grinding at night, putting a lot of force on these teeth, you might need a Bruxism appliance or commonly a nightguard.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	He's on Coumadin, and the doctor didn't do something to control the bleeding?  I'd have expected the doctor who removed the moles would have used some electrocautery, or at least a chemical styptic afterward.  Since pressure isn't working, it's time to get a little more drastic.   Actually, I would consider going to the ER and having them do something.  However, if you can't do that or don't want to- you could try an old fashioned styptic pencil.  Those are usually sold near shaving supplies.  You dampen the end and stick it to the spot that is bleeding.  It will burn like all woolly you know what, but it should stop the bleeding.  If you can't find a styptic pencil, go to the grocery store and get some Alum.  That is sold with the spices, in a white powdered form.  A dab of that on a q-tip will do the same thing.  And it will also burn.  These are the best suggestions I have.  At the ER they will have silver nitrate sticks they could use, which will also burn- and it aaccomplishesthe same thing.  However, the styptic pencil or the alum won't stain the skin.  But if those don't help, the ER would be the best bet.|`|da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	A brief search on Coumadin comes up this:    WARNING: BLEEDING RISK    Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur during the starting period and with a higher dose (resulting in a higher INR). Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age 65, highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, serious heart disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal insufficiency, concomitant drugs (see PRECAUTIONS) and long duration of warfarin therapy. Regular monitoring of INR should be performed on all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shorter duration of therapy. Patients should be instructed about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report immediately to physicians signs and symptoms of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients).    So get him to see a different doctor asap!     They may have to alter his dosage or change his medications until the bleeding stops.    If he has pain, tell him to take paracetamol and not aspirin or ibuprofen, because both of those thin the blood further.    If he is in severe pain, tell him to find something at the pharmacy that contains both paracetamol and codeine.    All the best, hopefully he gets well soon. :)|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	I don't think it sounds normal. I'd apply a lot of pressure. Remain laying down but gently up right and just rest.  If the bandage fills up with blood after firm pressure go to the ER.  Obviously the MD isn't in tune to the loss of blood here and it's obvious it needs medical attention. Obviously he's having trouble clotting.

01Mu3wUeaa	The virus can only survive on a surface no more than three days.You can stop worrying.      Norwalk virus prevention:    Norwalk virus  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)    The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.    PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.    The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.    It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)    Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.    If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.    To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.    People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)    The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!    TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|OXsRXLx1aa	If you were already infected with this virus then your body is prepared to fight off any recurring infections from it (as long as it hasn't mutated). Since it hasn't had a chance to reproduce it hasn't mutated so you should be OK since you've become healthy since being a carrier once.|`|Hv9hGUdqaa	6 hours

Watch the video.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQ...    You can ask on http:/craigslist.com for 8.5 alkaline drinking water, place a wanted add for the water.  Someone who has a  machine might see the add, and supply some water to you for a couple of weeks, to try it out.    Good Luck.|`|BVqCcqOGaa	Try herbal remedies from serenaskin.com, it's natural, no steroids.  I used cream and spray and now just take anti-eczema extract to prevent flare-ups.

6MUoeJRuaa	Dude, i have the (almost) exact same problem, except I am not 14 and i am not as skinny as you are, but anywho, our problem is basically, big lower body, being your thighs and your butt, a "pear-shaped" body, which is also a big issue that i am tryin to tackle and have been successful so far.  Here's exactly what i do;    Wake up early in the morning, like 5:30, eat 3 Hard boiled eggs, only the white part, some fruits (peaches, pinapples and definetly apples), EAT OATMEAL!     Do not be afraid to shove your face into some fresh and healthy breakfast, eat as much as you can.  Then go do whatever it is that you do, probably go to school since you're only 14, at around 9:30-10:00 eat some fruits or a small portion of salad.  Make sure you're active all day long though.  Around luch time 12:00-12:30 eat a nice portion of meal, such as a big bowl of salad with grilled chicken and fat free ranch.  Make sure you are drinking water at every meal, nothing else, then when the clock hits around 4:00-4:30, you should have consumed a good amount of water, finally hit the gym.  Now, you gotta understand, cardio like running is not much of a gain for us, so you have to do 20 mins. of Latteral Thigh, to see what the machine looks like look up "Tunturi Steppers" and 10 min. of bicycle.  That's a 30 min. of "cardio" at a med. stage. Then do your regular work out.  I take Hydroxycut Hardcore right now, and it helps me lose wait cause i wear like 3 sweat pants with a towel wrapped around my tummy and 2 shirts with a sweater on, so yea, it helps burn the fat by what i call "sweating" it out.  Do not take any proteins at this stage, cause it will go straight to your tighs, I KNOW, it happened to me... also, don't eat after 7:00 P.M. if you get hungry, drink water and if you MUST eat, eat tuna and/or fruits. Make sure you do this for at least 5 times a week before your work-outs, just try it for 2 weeks, and i guarentee you, you'll be seeing results, cause i am and im worse then you.. hope this helps bro... let me know if you have any questions about the program.. good luck!|`|HA2IV3r3aa	There's really only so much you can do.  We're all born with a basic body shape that we can't change.  Bodybuilders would be big no matter what they do, they are only taking advantage of a natural predisposition to low body fat and high muscle mass.  You've just got to continue to work with what you've got and learn to live with your body shape.|`|wJoMKfvqaa	Haha that made me giggle. (:  But to answer your question, you're probably not done growing yet. I don't mean the height part, I mean puberty. So as you get older, you should buff up. Just please, don't turn to steroids! D=|`|a3b52630743157741597cde1c1b1af9eaa	For some reason, the whole time I was reading your question, I kept picturing you as a girl...    It wasn't until I saw you're name was Colin that it clicked.|`|fwO92Bveaa	Go to walmart and buy a Muscle & Fitness magazine. This magazine is specifically targeted for body builders and remember that if you want great looking results that you need to eat organic foods, run a lot, and work on both gaining muscles mass and burning fat. Other wise your muscle will never show and you'll get that loose and tight look you were talking about.   Also, using protein powder (whey) in smoothies is a great way to do both.  Check out the magazine it will help you out!  Good Luck!!

If I thought the guy was too much of a freak I wouldn't have gone with him to the dance in the first place lol.  Little conversations are good when dancing, it just depends on what we're feeling like. Don't try to talk too much if the music is too loud though, because that's just hard to do and strains your voice. Touching depends on how close I am to the guy...It's normal for him to have his arms around my waist when dancing.    Don't stress out! Just let loose and have fun!|`|vrHwx5dsaa	WTF is sadies?|`|RmcgrPMOaa	Don't be afraid to touch her shoulder, hands, or whatever else you touch when dancing, because she should like that. however, don't touch her butt or anything, because it's only your first dance and if a guy did that to me so soon i'd be freaked out.     If you dance close at all, she'll love it if you play with her hair (only if she wears it down) but make sure you are really gentle and don't pull it!! Also, when dancing close you can stroke her back or neck slightly if you want, but not like you would your sister, i mean like romantically =P    My advice, she wouldn't have asked you to Sadie's unless she liked you, so I doubt you're a freak in her eyes! I think it's good to have some conversation when you are dancing but make sure there are some moments of silence too, and that you don't just talk talk talk the whole time lol.  Dances really aren't as big of a deal as they're cracked up to be, so just go with the flow and if instinct tells you to do something, do it.     good luck!|`|pWcJ37K3aa	just relax. most likely she is nervous too because she asked you so she does like you. don't talk too much but feel free to if you want don't worry too much about if you dance awkward. most people make this mistake though : don't walk too close to her or drag her everywhere and step on her feet. also avoid stepping on her feet during the dance as well. don't try to do the robot. if you do she'll probably fell so embarrassed she would cry. as for holding her just be on the look out if you do something she doesn't like you can tell. if you think you should hold her do so. just don't grind or give her a lap dance. that's too much. if you that unsure about something ask her about it. she might think it's cute that you care about how she feels. also respect her personal space. constant cuddling may get annoying for her depending on where you are in your relationship and how you feel about each other.finally and most importantly, trust yourself a little. you can forget about every ones comments and be fine. she likes you so your doing something right. everyone is different and likes different things. you can't go right all the time. if she expects you to she is insane. but do try, for she will appreciate it. also be a gentleman. open doors help take on/off her coat say nice things (physical and personal trait comments) but not sexual. once your there every thing will work out if its meant to be. if your always nervous she will think your a freak so do relax. and while doing all this... act NATURAL.|`|BkuBstK3aa	I think about the song we are dancing to and about the boy I am dancing with. If this girl really likes you then it won't matter to her if your a freak or not she'll like you for who you are. Having a conversation while dancing is a good thing. It gives you a chance to have one on one time with her. Just don't touch her butt or anything unless you feel that she won't care. If you do it and she don'tt like it you might hurt her feelings or something. Just go with what feels right and have a good time.
MJF7nMbpaa	Hey.    im 14 and one i got the same thing as you did. It was soo sore and i thought it was my appendicts. My mum took me to the hospitle and they said the it was a cyst. This means that your overy has little airbubbles on them and guess when they pop it hurts! I will tell you what my pain felt like and then you will be able to tell if you have a cyst.    -pain in lower stomach like kinda where you period cramps are  -you kinda want to bend over into a ball   -sometimes you can feel it in you lower back aswell.    so it is most probobly a cyst OR your appendicts.    Please go to the Doctor and get it checked JUST IN CASE t is your appendicts! Dont want them to pop inside you and for you to die!    GOOOOOODLUCK    let me know    xo|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	It could be gas. And sometimes our bodies are just weird! You might wanna go to the doctor! Hope this helps!|`|6eaa0b61f602657500c8e4340d6b6bfeaa	I would go and explain to your doctor, it could be many things, especially as it has been a few weeks now.  In the short term till you see the doctor try hot baths, stretching and having a hotwaterbottle on your tummy.  Even if it hurts to stretch do try a little - like hanging backwards over the edge of the bed or something.    Hope you feel better soon.

HA2IV3r3aa	There's nothing wrong with what happened, it's just a natural reaction.  Once you've finished going through puberty and your hormones get a little less raging, things that sexually arouse you will become more predictable.  But don't worry, you haven't done anything wrong.  A lot of young men's first sexual arousal is caused by a female relative.  If, however, you feel a need to act on your arousal and it doesn't go away after puberty you need to seek psychiatric help.  But that probably isn't the case, so I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Well, chances are, you simply got aroused by the sight of a nude woman. If it's the fact that she is your mom that got you going, then that could be problematic.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	that,s not normal. you probably saw something that you never saw before.|`|48Yf8tpsaa	So you saw a naked woman and that can be an erotic experience. It's not a big problem, mate. You really should get out more... see more naked people. Nudity itself is not about sex, but yor lack of exposure to nudity creates these feelings that link your observation of a naked woman, in this instance your mother, to sexual intercourse. It is not an erotic experience but you have been conditioned to think that seeing a naked woman is a sexual stimulus. It need not be so. Spend a few years on a nude beach and you realise that just seeing a naked woman will not lead to you having sex... and you will not react the same way...     BTW... Don't tell your priest.. that's not a real sin... and there's no need to get him all excited too.|`|slHUNl58aa	You are normal, it is a part of puberty. All naked ladies will make you have the urge to do that for a while. It is ok to tell your priest, tell him if you feel like it will help you not to feel so bad.  You are ok, don't worry.  P.S. God is not mad at you. You are perfectly normal.|`|RhkdnHPVaa	thats fine.  I'm 14 and I get boners around my teacher!!!  but I have a small **** so no one see's|`|AA10286987	Look up Oedipus.

NOW. if you make a habit out of trying to see her in the shower. you may have to really be tricky.|`|CZwJJetyaa	My advice is talk to someone who doesn't know you and can help you through this situation. Try calling 1-800-273-TALK   They have no way of knowing who you are and have professionals that can give you advice.  Good luck|`|pWcJ37K3aa	wow um... im... not... sure... if that's normal   i accidentally saw my mom naked once but my balls jumped up into my body and it disgusted me. it probably just depends on who you are. just find a Hot girl and try to forget it it's fine... i guess|`|sZYOg61Baa	sh it... i would prolly have to jerk it after seeing your mom naked too, but no thats not too normal|`|gDu53CIjaa	teach ur mom how to lock the door  di ck doesn't care who is infront it only knows someone is naked

When I first started getting my period at 12, I never had cramps or bloating but when I got older (around age 14) I got and cramps and then later on got bloating and breast swelling (around age 17).|`|kbtblEl1aa	normal  im the same way
HA2IV3r3aa	Yes, consuming more protein of any kind will help you bulk up.  But more importantly, you need to adjust your weight lifting habits.  To gain muscle mass, you need to do 80-90% of your one rep max for 4-8 reps and 3 sets.  Rest a lot between sets and make sure the last rep you do in an exercise takes all of your energy.  Hope this helps!|`|PBMZKeXoaa	you have probably seen some size differnce but maybe not quite as much as you like. Try doing slower reps for size and faster reps for strength. Whey protein won't help unless your a vegetarian or something. 5'7 123 is also pretty skinny especially for a wieight lifter and if your musles aren't getting bigger you may have put on fat. Still  i can't believe 5'7 107 pounds. If your only 15 don't worry though you may not have deveoped yet so its hard to gain serious strength at that young of an age|`|wl5YL8ukaa	protein shakes will definitely help you, because protein is one of the things that muscle is made of and also what it needs to develop. stick with it and you will get great results, i think you just need a little more time at 15 you're still not done growing so keep working out and be patient|`|dWFyBJSKaa	your too skinny, every guy will mature more from 15 years old. you can possibly stunt your growth big guy so take it easy on the gym. or jus try lifting as much as you can. rip your old muscles so new ones come in. try it, dont hurt yourself.|`|496babd9168b78c6f24aaf5a21f9133caa	you need protiens and make sure you have enough carbs before and after your work out|`|s4vb9spDaa	You gained weight and if it is muscle weight, then it is good. Don't worry about bulking up, it takes to gain muscle weight and takes time to show it.   ISO Protein is good to repair muscle tissue which will gain you more muscle.   Remember, it is hard to build muscle, Muscle weights more then fat, hence it is hard to see it on your body. But you are progressing.|`|9kxbdoAmaa	Heh you shouldn't be lifting heavy at this age but whatever that isn't the topic.  You should eat a lot of chicken and turkey, things that are high in protein.  If you really want to you can =take whey protein.  But working heavy at that age will make you stay short. but if thats how you wanna do it go for it. Hit the protein shakes and protein foods. Make sure you get the carbs in  Edit:  CHRISTIAN YOU ARE A ******* IDIOT.  Kids lifting heavy *** weight is exactly how they get ****** up for the rest of their lives  you should be jailed for your stupidity|`|AkbYFpMiaa	Its mostly because your 15 and you need time to grow and stuff. Try to do more weight instead of reps reps give you bulk more weight gives you definition :)
i0nlqfJVaa	Technically there is no safe time for you to have sex and not get pregnant. So you may as well have sex whenever you want. Condoms are not foolproof, but they are better than nothing. Why can you not get birth control? The best combination of birth control I find is the pill and condoms.|`|sK9kDAtLaa	condoms are perfect. and u cant get prego anytime even during your period.|`|CZwJJetyaa	Condoms are safest. If you need condoms or birth control pills go to http://www.plannedparenthood.org/  Good luck|`|n24githIaa	Some people think it's gross.  But to be honest my mother and I both think having sex while ON your period (protected and unprotected) is actually pretty great.  It relieves period cramps. :D  Plus!!! You CANNOT I repeat CAN NOT get pregnant if you don't use a condom. :)  Count 14 days after the first day of your period... that date is your ovulation date. Don't have sex a few days before, or a few days after that date...  This is to avoid pregnancy. :)  Good luck. Sex is a very beautiful thing.|`|EWN5Gy2vaa	You can do it while you have your period because you will not get pregnant while you have your period and right after is safe. The only time that you ovulate is in the middle between your periods.|`|dsBCGbWpaa	I'm very suprised by all the women who are telling you that you can't get pregnant while you're on your period. This is FALSE! You can get pregnant at any time of the month because sperm can stay alive in your vagina for up to 7 days. Use condoms and make sure you know how to put them on properly. If you need birth control you can visit planned parenthood. Best of luck!|`|pkS7I3soaa	There is no safe time to have sex. So it really dosn't matter. Make sure to have tons of condoms. Like a lot....in case some break during or some loose the lube, or you do it a lot. And also have Plan B or plan on getting on birth control. If youre highschool age go to a planned parenthood and they'll give you that stuff for free. Thats what I did
4RpUP4teaa	Try to make some changes in your schedule. Make sure you have a lunch period, and certainly a free period to get some of your homework out of the way. Try staying in the library, or even an empty classroom if you are allowed to after school. Sometimes you might have better concentration if you work in a different place. If you have lots of majors, consider dropping one. Move down levels in some of your classes or take easier ones altogether. Take some of your core classes during summer school to free up time during the year. Summer school classes are more laid back and more fun than you'd think.    And you've probably heard this, but get enough sleep at night. Don't work till 1 in the morning or get up at 5 AM to finish up your work. If it's not done, it's not done. You DESERVE to sleep! And if it's not too hard, talk to an advisor or teacher. They will likely help you out.
NgtGJWdDaa	What I do strongly suggest is to get yourself some good vitamins.  A very good multi-vitamin once a day and the best omega 3 you can find.    It's not going to make a huge difference but it definitely takes the edge off.  It will also boost your immunity.    Oh, on the note of immunity.  It would be a good idea to take an extra zinc supplement.  That will help stop you from getting ill.|`|bJnLmvkqaa	i bet your doctor does.|`|Nb1Dh2B0aa	I also have bipolar (type2). I find that exercise and keeping myself mentally busy can really help to take your mind off things. That combined with medication and professional mental care can go a long way to making bipolar disorder managable.    Hope that helps :)|`|HtRLnntRaa	Only a doctor can prescribe the drugs you need (UK).    My mums had it for about 10 years, she takes diazepam (vallium), lithium, and sometimes chlopromazine (something like that).    If you take lithium remember never to take ibuprofen as it can cause a toxic reaction.|`|95305a595de7cbc914577df5969ece1faa	talk to ur dr. and i think its different with every1 wat works for 1 person may not work for u. i no its like tht for depression so it maybe for bipolar 2. just talk to ur dr.|`|3rJwDjbwaa	This is something that a doctor must deal with. There are no homeopathic remedies for bipolar disorder, and it's not worth trying because the disease is that of a psychotic type, so PLEASE go to a doctor.  Medicines I've known people to take and work are (roughly in order of efficacy): Abilify, Geodone, Risperdal, Lamictal, Lithium.  I would stay away from the lithium, though. It really really really makes you sick. Like, really. Sick. Sick. Sick.|`|LlyDsHxgaa	Abilify
axkgR1wjaa	hey congratulations on your baby! and my hat off to you for exercising to get rid of the baby fat so soon!  But unfortunately fat is distributed throughout the body, so you can't really spot reduce, although the exercises you have mentioned are good for toning, jogging is what i would reccomend, unfortunately its sometimes hard especially when you have a kid, but you could try calisthenics at home, and this will sound crazy, but jumpin' rope will help! keep that heart rate up while you workout and make sure you exercise for over 20 min, to get into the fat burning zone!  good luck hope it helps!
HD7kdAnNaa	It certainly can slow you down a bit. I asked my Dr about it a while back, because you're bleeding your iron levels usually dip a bit that time of the month, which  is what causes you to feel slightly more lethargic :)|`|5Ra5xbziaa	no,but it might be from how heavy you feel|`|4RpUP4teaa	Running is a great muscular workout as you very well know. You use some of the largest muscles in your body and they require alot of oxygen and nutrients in your blood to work best. Your uterus also gets an extensive workout with all of the contractions. In effect, it is hogging a portion of the oxygen and nutrients in your blood that would have ordinarily gone to your legs, for example. So yes, this could be possible. What would be beneficial would be to increase the volume capacity of your lungs, but there's no need to kill yourself. Do as you normally do.
c48634003f378a460b66241e5ecae670aa	You definitely have tendonitis of the patella (knee) and achilles tendonitis.  I'm 100% sure about this, because I have the same problem with my right knee.  Tendonitis is simply an inflammation of the tendon, which connects muscle to bone.  Interestingly, this can develop for two reasons: very little physical activity with this particular tendon or overuse of the tendon.  The cause is usually overuse and improper or no warming up before and after vigorous exercise, such as running.You did not mention your age, but if you have been a runner, it can occur at any age past 25.  In my case, it developed in my very late 20's after running 4 or 5 times a week (4 miles or more) for about 14 years.  Now, there is good news and bad news.  The bad news first:  Once it starts, it will never go away 100%.  Plenty of good news: Please follow these recommendations and you will be fine (I went to 3 doctors and did my own research): 1) Go to physical therapy for at least a few weeks. The therapist will work on stretching and strengthening these particular tendons.  2) Learn to do these exercises on your own.  If you truly want to improve, plan on following very consistent stretching and strengthening exercises at least 5 times a week for 6 months.  The stretching should be done at least 3 times a day for 15-20 minutes each time.  The strength training (usually with the machines) should be done at least 3 times a week for about 20-25 minutes each time.  Remember: Use light weight, since you must start slow and easy when treating tendons.  You can do light walking but try to avoid running as much as possible for as long as you can.  3) Take glucosamine and chondroitin supplements.  These have helped me a lot.  They are about $30 for a bottle that lasts a couple of months.  You can find them at any store that sells vitamins.  4) More good news:  If you take care of this right away, your tendons should be (with time and hard work on your part) about 90% back to normal.  I'm back to running (up to 5 miles), although not everyday, because it's not good for the knees.  Now, I only stretch before AND after a hard workout or at least 3 times a week, whether or not I work out. A lot better than 15 times a week!  Also, I use the strength  training machines in the gym at least 3 times a week for about an hour each time (with very heavy weight) and my knees feel great.  Absolutely no problems, even 100% while I'm doing the machines with heavy weight!  If I don't follow my routine for several days, then I begin to feel the pain again under my knee.  At least now I know (and so do you) that there's definitely something I can do to make it better.  Do not despair, be patient, continue the physical therapy for at least 6 months (on your own so you don't have to pay for it), continue with light exercise on these tendons, and you should be fine.  Also, once you start running again, always stretch at least 15 minutes before and for several minutes after.  This is VERY important!  My pain was so bad that I could hardly walk so it feels great to run again!  So, keep a positive attitude, stay focused, and please do what you can to take care of this now or it will only get worse, instead of better.  Good luck, my friend!|`|64nOL7oFaa	ankle:  - Tendonitis:  inflammation of the tendons (attaches muscle to bone) surrounding whatever structure is described in the diagnosis    sounds like you have Achilles tendinitis(inflammation of the Achilles tendon) or inflammation of the lateral tendon on the ankle ((LCL), the one on the outside of the foot)    symptoms are reddening, swelling, loss of function, loss of range of motion and can also lead to tears and other serious injuries if not correctly handled    Knee:  -Sounds to me like you have problems with your patelar tendon (the tendon the is in the very front of the knee) look at a picture for other clarification    this is common to have knee problems when you also have ankle problems because your ankle is not able to tak e weight so the force is applied oo the knee instead when you walk. fix your ankle and your knee problems should go away. good luck.

Drinking a lot of water can flush out your pores - or so i've heard.    I usually get zits in clusters, but since i've been drinking more water, I will admit that the ones I do get aren't clustered and are less raging.    Good luck.
IAkEyPb9aa	I take it you are doing the US version of Osteopathy?  You could qualify as a DO and disappear into mainstream medicine like most US trained Osteopaths.  From what I've heard Most US Osteos go into general family practice.  Most have no clue how to do any manual therapy and many refer to PT's or Chiro's (which is a disgrace if they use the title 'Osteopath')  A majority of US Osteopathic students went to Osteopathic schools because they didn't quite make it into regular med school and the DO qualification allows them to practice regular medicine alongside MD's  Consequently most drop Osteopathy.    Having said all that there are some fantastic US trained Osteopaths who drop the medicine and only do Osteopathy.  Providing you only want to research stuff to do with regular medicine the DO qualification shouldn't make a great deal of difference. You will struggle to get funding to study anything Osteopathic though because there is very little money to be made in Osteopathic treatments unless you are the practitioner. I can't see akron couches or the people manufacturing couch roll funding research as they will sell their products anyway.     Look at the international journal of Osteopathic medicine if you want more info. I don't think a lot of it as the research predominantly tries to use the reductionist model which just doesn't fit well with a multi-factorial system.    Interesting that you are thinking of Hematology. 2 things i think we should have covered more extensively are Hematology and Dermatology. Hematology because one of the Osteopathic concepts states 'The rule of the Artery is Supreme' and the other because we come into contact with lots of skin.    Although I dislike the US osteopathic model with a passion it is possible to train under this model and become an excellent ostoepathic practitioner so i think its worth doing. It gives you another choice and if you don't like it you can carry on down the route of conventional medicine.
EM2aYwXzaa	Hey I have the same problem! Except well mine is all over my foot. First it happened on my hand and now on my foot. I'm guessing it's because of the dry and cold weather. I also tried lotion and everything and it didn't help. The best idea is to peel as much off as you can (only the parts that don't hurt) and leave the rest. Eventually all your dry skin will be peeled off and no more will come off. Sorry, I know it's gross but its the best way to get over it. Besides you wear socks and shoes most of the time so it won't hurt you.  Hope this helps.|`|sPOmz9wUaa	Try the ped egg to remove dry and peelign skin. You should also use a nail file or a 'foot file' used for removing dry skin from your feet. After this soak your feet in warm water, dry them, adn apply lotion.|`|w9cicy0Daa	Are you sure it isn't a fungal infection? Peeling skin can be a symptom of this. Also damp conditions (sweaty feet) can soften the skin to make it peel. Try washing your feet and wearing more sock changes. A salt bath may also help.    It might not be Tinea Pedis, because this starts to itch and turn red even before peeling.    edit to below: Foot files are not always a good idea for peeling skin, they sometimes allow the skin to break further and allow microbes to enter. Better to remove it with sterilized tweezers/forceps, and only the skin that comes away easily.|`|9uI3hvGdaa	sounds like you may have tinea pedis (athlete's foot).  Try some tinactin spray or another fungicide.

As someone who's done both BZP and MDMA, I'd suggest saving your pennies and getting some real ecstasy. The effects are so much better, and the comedown is nowhere near as harsh.

RoDjZKknaa	It all depends on your locale.  Here in California our office charges $80 for a cleaning, fluoride and oral hygiene assessment and instruction.  The Xrays and exam are $70-$85 depending on the number of films needed.  The cavities are difficult because that depends on the number of surfaces involved on each tooth.  If you had a tooth that just had decay on the chewing surface and it was small that one be considered one surface.  Approx $100.  2 or more surfaces, as you can imagine can reach, well over $200.  If most of the tooth is decayed a better option may be a stainless steel crown.    Hope this helps|`|5jf5tcMnaa	It is a very hard question to answer.  Dentists will vary in their fees.

Look out for hidden calories and snacking. Force yourself to count up every single cracker or juice packet you have.     At your height and weight, it will probably come off more quickly than it would for some people, so you definitely have that on your side. If things slow down, don't get discouraged. It just means you're plateauing- which is not a bad thing, despite what people say. If your habits are still the good healthy ones you're trying to accomplish, it means you are gaining muscle faster than you're losing fat, but does not say anything about inches. I lost 2 dress sizes once at a time when I gained 5 pounds. It is hard to concentrate on how well you're doing instead of just the numbers, but really try to focus on the actions instead of the scale.|`|axkgR1wjaa	hey amanda, think of it like this, there's 3,500 calories in a pound (on a person).  an orange has about 60 calories, an apple about 100, a hot pocket about 250, a double cheeseburger has 421 calories.  the average runner burns about 7 calories per minute... do you really want to eat 2000 calories a day?
H6uYThgjaa	as far as your food intake goes, you should aim for 5 to 6 meals a day, such that you eat every 2.5 to 3 hours. keep them small but not too small. make sure your food choices are high in lean protein, i.e. turkey, chicken, eggs, tofu. add fruits and veggies to your meals. avoid fruit juices and soda. have water only when it comes to beverages. for snacks, choose yoghurts, fruits, and small amounts of nuts. and, NO teas and dietary pills will help you lose weight!!!|`|WcFCOkIQaa	What you should do is go jogging every morning, if you eat your normal food, that's like more than fine. Just avoid any kind of fried stuff, or candy, or chocolate. Fried stuff you can eat twice a week or once, and that's it. You should also dance when you're free. It helps. (TRUST ME!!!!)|`|N5ncEyI0aa	don't lose the weight.... turn it into muscle... big people can turn muscular faster than skinny people! Just workout at your high school gym|`|029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	You never told us how tall you are. 170 might be an ideal weight for you, especially if you're 5'9" or taller.|`|DWCSDzo4aa	poop|`|xF7XLRQzaa	It's WEIGHT.      Thanks that was just bothering me.|`|ArkfFTuLaa	Start jogging!!!  Jogging for like 10 mintues can burn up to 320 calories. Imagine how many you would loose in 30 minutes.   Plus once you start to get into a routine of jogging everyday you'll WANT AND NEED to go out for a jog. I know if i skip a day of jogging i feel guilty and really push myself the next day. I know it really helps me.  Good luck!|`|9LGInLsYaa	Most people think that they gain weight when they eat a lot of food and end up starving them selves.. but its not true.   i'm 15 weight about 107lbs. I'm very skinny NEVER been on a deit and i eat like a PIGG~!  What makes a person gain weight is SALT!! But you cant eliminate salt from your diet all together.. its important to eat it but just limit it.   If your body lacks salt your body will break down and it'll be impossible to play your sports. And too much turns into fat. So plan out your meals. Make sure its balanced. TRUST me it helps~ there is no way to lose weight FAST.. if there was everyone would be skinny.. it takes hard work and determination. Also make sure you excerise regularly.|`|x3zMVR9Kaa	The most important thing when it comes to dieting is doing it in a healthy way...and fast isn't healthy so you have to give your body time. A crash diet is never the best way to go becasue if you dont continue with that routine you'll gain the weight right back. First off, its a good thing to stay active. Doing a minimum of 30-60 minutes a day for at least four days a week is ideal for your age. If you want to make your activity level rise, do that, but be careful to be hydrating your body constantly in order to maintiain a healthy body. Secondly comes  your food diet. The main thing is to lower your calories by eating smaller portions and taking in smaller meals more frequently. Packaging snacks for school like cut up fruits and vegetables and maybe a small yoplait yogurt is even good. Another key thing is to keep a journal of everything. What you eat, your activity, your feelings, etc. Its always good to have these things written down. Record your progress and you wont disappointment yourself. Good luck and be healthy!!
PWoR4Lj3aa	sounds like a nerve.. I had the same problem from guitar playing... It can lead to carpal tunnel or tendinitis.. I started using wrist supports like lifters wear... I ordered mine from a site that targets musicians ... but they are really good!! I am not trying to spam anyone or sell anything.. but these are great for wrist support and I think they offer a money back guarantee so you should check them out.. they will support your wrist and let it heal..   www.newgrip.com/musician.html|`|9pLdhuBnaa	An irritated nerve could be a cause for this pain (an example only), but the only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
UDKLeWd2aa	repeat after me NOTHING CAN STUN YOUR GROWTH unless you start taking un nessary harm full drugs like steroids or something but my trainer said nothing can stun your growth, its all genetics|`|37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	Stunting your growth with working out is more of a myth.  It would take some very serious outs to stunt your growth if it's even possible. You are fine with what your doing.|`|64nOL7oFaa	yes, you should be fine      the only way to stunt your growth is to injure a growth plate, it wont make you shrink or anything just you will slow down your growth pattern and will cause some frailty in new bones|`|aVqIKPdyaa	Growth plates are the only thing that stunt your growth and that is if you injure them.    But as for your question, no that wont prevent or stop it.  Hell, for mass gaining you do high weight low reps.    But you are 15 years old.  If you really want to GROW, then EAT EAT EAT. Drink protein withing 30 min after a workout for maximum intake, drink like 3 gallons of water daily (more like 1 but whatever :P) and eat.    But make sure your form is good.  Bad form will injure those plates.|`|029dfd57698be0abbf06b24b24c17c53aa	No, it won't. You have to do some major damage to stunt your growth.     However, it IS possible to stunt your growth under extreme circumstances, despite what a few of the people above said. For example, there was a girl who was strapped to a toilet for the first 13 years of her life and was not fed at regular intervals. This stunted her growth, as she was only about 4 feet tall at 13 years old. However, I think you'll agree that said circumstance was reasonably more serious than whey protein. It also occurred because it did damage to something called a growth plate.    If all you're consuming is whey protein, that would be serious enough to give you health problems. I would expect other health problems to occur long before lack of growth, however.
PyQhb7gCaa	Hie Savannah, with my own experience >> I am using it and I've lost so many kgs and inches ;) I became an Independant Distributor then. it's a miracle. so many people noticing me and asking me what's my secret ;) I just need to tell them, Herbalife! Thanks and credits to Herbalife :)    No side effects but you can notice that your health improves as well as your eating habit changes to better .. I lost 6 kgs till today and still losing. I enjoy consuming the shakes in Chocolate flavour.    I can wear all my favourite clothes and lost a size. My t-shirts are from M to S. my pants from L to M .. I am satisfied with this Herbalife and it really changed my life to have a healthy living lifestyle.|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	Yes.  It has side effects.  The formula is kept as a secret and ingredients are not known. Take utmost care, before consumption.|`|su4grPAWaa	Herbalife is nothing but the same product, like the ones which can make a fat man to slim in just 4 weeks. And people don't want to do the regular exercise or follow the natural ways. They are attracted by these kind of shortcut ads & give them good business.    Did our parents generation live with herbalife ??    Though they say that it is 100% natural, they would really have some preservatives or chemicals that would cause side-effects in our body system.|`|Zrvb2fx4aa	Herbalife is 100% effective when taken properly.    All Herbalife products are natural and designed to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to function. All of the Herbalife products are low dose for maximum absorption into your system.     In response to emce, Herbalife follows the mega-dosing laws and the labelling laws which means that they must disclose each and every ingredient that they put into each product on the label and that there cannot be too much of any one ingredient in a product.    Also, in response to wilson, yes our parents generation may have lived without Herbalife, however, times have changed and so has the nutritional value of the food that we consume with the addition of pesticides, additives and preservatives. Even broccoli straight out of the ground does not have the same level of nutritional value it used to.    Herbalife products give us the proper nutrition needed to help to repair and replenish our bodies at the cellular level.    Imagine your body as a car and the nutritional value of the products we consume these days as the fuel for your engine. Wouldn't the car run better if it had high quality gas in it or would you put watered-down gas in your car.    Herbalife is simply compressed nutritious food.    If we can help you in way or if you have any further questions, please contact us for a nutritional information session.

Jelqing may actually work for some people. However, it must be done often (at least daily) and over a long period of time (months, year, or years) to produce a small result.
