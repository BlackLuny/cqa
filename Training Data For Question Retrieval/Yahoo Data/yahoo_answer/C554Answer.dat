AA12144656	In order to build muscle mass you will need to use resistance and work to failure. Every muscle group should be worked with 2 sets each and then after you are comfy with this move on to 3 sets each.  For instance:<br>  Chest: 2 sets--First set light 16 reps.  <br>                           Second set heavier 12 reps<br>  & later--            Third set heaviest 8 reps<br>  <br>  The last set, whether 2 or 3 sets should be really pushing yourself, hard to finish.  The muscles must be overloaded in order for muscle mass growth to be achieved.|`|5pnl6uoPaa	When i was in the marines on ship i gained mass and kept it on since then 40 pounds...now it worked for me and hopefully for you. <br>  <br>  I worked out hard but the way i worked out was different i went heavy and always burned out i made sure i ripped my muscles.....you gain by tearing muscles and they rebuild with new muscle....so you must not just do an exercise you must have proper form and push a certain percentage i believe its 60 percent and you must not take long breaks within sets and various exercises........you must mentally push yourself as well  im ripenn up right now im trying to drop size.....its working..<br>  <br>  oh and i was eating plenty ....proper food <br>  i made sure i slept allot that is the only time you are fully rested not awake sitting watching tv<br>  i was taking regularr creatine no taste just pure you can get from gnc that other stuff cost more just cuz of flavor you can mix plain with anything<br>  and proteinen shakes.....fallow that and you shall see gain dont go to heavy where you cant do proper form you will gain nothing ....hope this helps.|`|ZPcCcONNaa	Weights is not enough - you need more iron and protein in your diet|`|TPTpwarwaa	Well remember things all take time. And you need to push yourself sometimes to get to the limit you want.<br>  Eat more protein in the day-lean meat, dairy, eggs, tofu, nuts, high-protein cereals (like Kashi Go Lean), maybe look into a supplement at GNC or somewhere like that..<br>  Do different types of weights/exercises to build all of your muscles at the highest peak. Such as using machines and dumbells together. Adding variety really helps<br>  Also, warming up your muscles with cardio gives you the best performance and building of your muscles-go on the treadmill for about 5-10 minutes before weights<br>  And remember, after every exercise stretch all of your muscles for atleasst 30 seconds.<br>  Make sure you are giving your muscles time to rest, if you keep working them every day you won't get any results due to they need to recover and grow properly/stronger. Give you muscles 48 hours to recover between each session

My bench is 120, incline 110, squat 180, and dead lift 190. It sounds like you are doing pretty good. But if you plan on continuing football in high school then you will definitely want to bulk up. I know guys who bench at least 200 and most don't squat under 250. Just keep working out, eating healthy, and lifting and it'll go up gradually! You have to work for anything worth having.<br>  But for your age now, I'd say that you're doing perfectly good.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  :]|`|Azww28cvaa	you are normal bmi. you are probably very strong. good job :)

Read all the labels.  If you have a choice of 110 calorie bread or 90 caloried bread...choose 90 calories.  Do this with everything.  It all adds up.  Then if you want to start doing more, exercise.  Just go for a long walk everyday...burns calories. Park out in the far end of a parking lot and walk...burns calories.   Do about 50 situps each night...burns calories.  Another great tummy exercise is twists.  Just twist at the waist.  You can do this while standing around waiting.   It's all about calories.  Put in less than you use and in three months you will have the bikini body you want.  Honestly it's not hard, it just takes persistence.

Of course you don't want to randomly change it every day, but if you take it an hour later or earlier, it's not going to make a difference, you're still going to have the residual hormones from the last pill in your system, and when you take your next one, you'll still be covered.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	You don't have to adjust, just take it at 8:15 as usual.|`|UVgt1IhPaa	ive never adjusted my pill to the time change, and i never got pregnant. its when its after an hour that it becomes an issue. but if you are on a pill that makes you get a period, i would just keep taking it at 9:15 until you are on the placebo pills (which dont matter) and then after you are done with those and go back to the regular pills, I would just start them again at 8:15. thats what I would do. but really, an hour isnt that serious.

Do you want that when your older? I don't think so. I actually do the bike, which is amazing...the faster you petal the more calories you burn....the belly is actually burning fat b/c you are sweating. Not a lot of ppl. know that walking on treadmill/bike/or walking outside burns fat around the mid section...but it is so true.

Ummm lets see, what else? Theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low (but that is rare b/c I usually get my protein in evvveryday. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of Carbs in it depending on which version you get.

There is also absolutely no sugar in it either (sugar if not burned turns into fat btw)….. <br>  The calories range from like 90 to 140 calories too! Oh, did I mention they are extremely delicious!?

The only detox I'm okay with is the one outlined in "The Maker's Diet" but even then I wouldn't take the supplements he recommends. I would suggest making a chicken or bone broth soup using:<br>      *  1 whole chicken (free range, pastured, or organic chicken)<br>      * 2-4 chicken feet (optional)<br>      * 3–4 quarts cold filtered water<br>      * 1 tablespoon raw apple cider vinegar<br>      * 4 medium-sized onions, coarsely chopped<br>      * 8 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped<br>      * 6 celery stalks, coarsely chopped<br>      * 2–4 zucchinis chopped<br>      * 4–6 tablespoons of extra virgin coconut oil<br>      * 1 bunch parsley<br>      * 5 garlic cloves<br>      * 4 inches grated ginger<br>      * 2–4 tablespoons Celtic sea salt<br>      * 1/4-1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper<br>  <br>  Directions: If you are using a whole chicken, remove fat glands and the gizzards from the cavity. By all means, use chicken feet if you can find them. Place chicken or chicken pieces in a large stainless steel pot with the water, vinegar, and all vegetables except parsley. Let stand for 10 minutes before heating. Bring to a boil and remove scum that rises to the top. Cover and cook for 12 to 24 hours. The longer you cook the stock, the more healing it will be. About 15 minutes before finishing the stock, add parsley. This will impart additional mineral ions to the broth.<br>  <br>  Remove from heat and take out the chicken and the chicken feet. Let it cool and remove chicken meat from the carcass, discarding the bones and the feet. Drop the meat back to the soup.<br>  <br>  Eat this as well as some salads with an ACV dressing for a week or so.|`|GKM1DvdTaa	Try fleet you can buy it over the counter at chemists , its what they use to flush you out before a colonoscopy|`|UyDkYaXuaa	o.o consult a doctor?|`|99fbdd9a9f126bdd5d48eb028a8f8dcaaa	Latest bull.... fad. If you eat a normal diet you do not need it.
eYMVIK0Raa	Most food protein rich food contains essential amino acids.  Protein can't be manufactured by the body unless all the required amino acids are present.<br>  <br>  BCAA stands for Branch Chain Amino Acid, they are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These 3 amino acids are the most important for muscular growth and development.  <br>  <br>  BCAA are faster in body abosorbtion rate than tryptophan and tyrosine amino acids.  However, you can't take BCAA and tryptophan and tyrysine at the same time because they nullified each other's effect.  However you can take them by turns.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of other amino acids and their effects:<br>  <br>  Histidine: vital tometabolic process of protein synthesis<br>  <br>  Arginine: boost growth hormone, however needs to be balanced.<br>  <br>  Glycine: nitrogen pool for the manufacture of the nonessential amino acids, also important element in the structure of red blood cells.  Another word, energy.<br>  <br>  Lysine: slowdown in protein synthesis affecting both muscle and collagen formation.<br>  <br>  Proline: very similiar to Lysine.<br>  <br>  Cystine: component of tissue antioxidant mechanics.  So that translates to diminished pain from imflammation, prolonged youth.<br>  <br>  Glutamic Acid: boots energy with vitamin B-complex and magnesium.<br>  <br>  Alanine: regulate blood sugar leveld.  Stablize muscle loss.  So without it, you will loose muscle.<br>  <br>  Serine: celluar energy producer.  Also aids memory.   Serine can be formed by essential amino acid threonine.  <br>  <br>  Threonine: Excessive use of this can cause too much ammonia toxicity in the body.  Must be used with vitamin B6, magnesium and niacin.<br>  <br>  Methionine: help to remove poisonous waste from your liver, repairs liver and kidney tissues.  Influences hair follicle health.<br>  <br>  Phenylalanine: for pain reduction and antidepression threapy.<br>  <br>  Tryptophan: increase serotonin.  which helps to depress stress and moddiness and regulates daily biological rhythms.<br>  <br>  Aspartic acid: converts carb into glucose and then into glycogen, which is the main source of muscle energy.
fPpmgxjuaa	yea its easier to get fat than to get muscular...thats y there is so many fat ppl. ive been trying to gain weight by muscles since last year and only gained like 5-6 pounds so far...|`|mhXHNcHEaa	about a month they will start to improve if you do your workout every day
dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	It's likely that you are. Here's a little tip. When you start to feel like its about that time, you might consider wearing a pantyliner until you actually do so you don't have any embarassing accidents at school. I always took that precaution and a friend of mine didn't listen and the poor girl walked around half the day and no one told her.|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	I always have cramps the day before my period<br>  That sounds like its coming so be prepared if your in school or anything|`|xO1LQWbZaa	Maybe so.  I'm 17, and I got mine when I was 12.  Your around that age, so maybe.  It could also be in your head.  But it is possible.  You shouldn't get cramps until a few hours after you've started bleeding for your first time.  You could be having those signs because you're going through puberty.  You should get it soon if your brest's are growing and you see hair in different places.  You'll get it soon, sweetie, so don't worry.  So be ready!  <br>  <br>  Good luck, sweetie!|`|EZdHWa4taa	Eh, probably.|`|3LJUpW4Yaa	sounds like it yes

You ate too little and had cake.|`|mLabzxnIaa	bad choice in ice cream but over all you did okay|`|mbfMYmzWaa	Nah, you ate a pretty average days worth of food.. <br>  <br>  Your caloric intake depends on what you cooked the chicken in, what kind of ice-cream or cake you had, as well as ALL your serving sizes... but it looks like the right amount of food, you could probably fill up on a bit more fruit and heaps of veggies if you wanted to with out having a negative impact. <br>  <br>  The excercise is great, but it doesn't have much to do with the nutritional benifits. Especially if your swimming though, that's great cardio (calorie burning). It probably explains the cake binge, lol... I'm always like the cookie monster after a day at the beach.|`|Ncb7WoB3aa	well cant know unless we know exactly what kinds of stuff you ate like what kind of cake, etc, the best thing to do is go to these different calorie counter websites and try to find the exact food you ate but dont make it a habit try to read labels dont eat anything that doesnt have a label, or anything your not sure of. that is if you are trying to lose weight. if your just randomly wondering how much you ate today then you dont have to keep in mind alot of what i said. but anyways as a guesstimate, id say about 1000-1500. assuming that since your a girl "alot" of cake is really only 1 slice or so. lol, but i think thats alot to. you should be fine expecially since you excersiced.|`|dLhOXWR8aa	uh depends on what type of cake and what type of food you ate.. check the calories|`|pQ1KlYtgaa	cake and ice cream is too much sugar.<br>  The salad needs a protein like a side of bean or vegetable.<br>  you did not drink water to hydrate.<br>  you can go to www.mypyramid.gov and learn what you need to eat daily to be healthier.<br>  good luck.|`|AA11256693	No idea on the calories, but you did eat way too much sugar!<br>  A much larger portion of your diet should be vegetables.

I would stay away from pasta and rice they are carbs and you burn them quickly for energy, so shortly you will be hungry again. I am not staying stay away from carbs but choose good ones like whole wheat bread and brown rice. Also do not eat any carbs after lunch. Simply because carbs are used for energy and when they are not used up they are stored as fat. So eat some at lunch to give you enough energy to make it till bed time. good luck|`|ANCKG9ywaa	Boiled Potatoes & plain rice. Toss some oil as per your concern.|`|hJQBLiqlaa	Fiber is good.

GGlFHz7waa	Depends on your goals. I go every other day no matter what day it is for hour and a half(Weight lift for 45 minutes and the rest is cardio machine). You always have to make sure that you let your body rest for a full day after a workout session to recover. Most girls I see just go to the gym and do cardio which is ok in my books but they could be doing so much better doing minor weight lifting.|`|RRr0BH6oaa	i like to go atleast 5 days a week but you could get Just as good results if you went 4 days a week. I stay between an hour and a half to 3 hours depending if i feel like running a treadmill or not.

3BYKloQgaa	Here are my top low-fat snacks that really make me feel like I'm not missing out on taste, but i'm still doing something healthy and good for myself. Hope this helps you. <br>  <br>  1- Hershey's Kisses are a perfect choice if you're looking to curb a chocolate craving. Creamy and full of flavor, these morsels are substantial and satisfying. And at only 100 calories for three pieces, your waistline won't have to suffer for your indulgence.<br>  <br>  2- For a decadent and visually delightful treat, top raw, sliced fruit with Cool Whip Lite. A half cup of fresh strawberries paired with four tablespoons of the light whipped topping equals a measly 90 calories.<br>  <br>  3- Top half an English muffin with one teaspoon of protein-packed peanut butter and you'll have a healthy and filling snack with only 95 calories. Spread the low-cal goodwill by sharing the other half with a co-worker.<br>  <br>  4- For a crunchy and sweet snack, what could be better than cripsy, crumbly graham crackers? Two sheets of this classic treat have exactly 100 calories.<br>  <br>  5- Easy to grab on the go, Jell-O Fat-Free Pudding Snacks come in delicious flavors like chocolate, tapioca, devil's food, and chocolate/vanilla swirl. Light on calories -- coming in at just 100 -- these pudding cup cuties are full of flavor.<br>  <br>  6- Creamy and delicious, frozen yogurt is a perfect treat any time of the year. Just three ounces of a fat-free brand will only set you back 100 calories.<br>  <br>  7- There's nothing like beautiful, fresh, ripe cherries to brighten up your palate. A cup of this antioxidant-rich fruit has only 95 calories.<br>  <br>  8- Eggs used to get a bad rap, but now they're back in good favor because they are such a good source of iron and protein. One medium hard-boiled egg delivers a host of essential vitamins and just 81 calories.<br>  <br>  9- Crunchy almonds make a filling, protein-packed snack. While we don't suggest overindulging, 10 raw almonds roughly equals a diet-friendly 100 calories. Can't find them raw? Roasted, without salt, only adds a few more calories.<br>  <br>  10- Three cups of air-popped popcorn weigh in at just 93 calories and give you nearly 15 percent of your daily requirement of fiber -- making it the perfect snack to fill you up, not out.|`|AA11707728	Beef Jerky.  Made form ultra lean cuts of beef, most jerky is low in calories, low in fat and low in carbs.  Most of the calories come from lean meat protein.  Check out the nutrition info on the back of some packages of beef jerky to see what I mean.  Convert that info into whatever point system Weight Watchers uses.  Most normal jerky is basically the same, nutritionwise, as long as you aren't eating some weird esoteric brand like Bacon Jerky.  <br>  <br>  Beef jerky has an extremely high satiety value.  Good jerky also has a great deal of flavor and ability to  satisfy a desire to snack on something flavorful.  You eat it slowly, taking many minutes to savor the flavor as it hydrates in your mouth, then swallowing it has a very strong ability to control hunger.  Just stay away from brands that have MSG in them.  MSG is a strong appetite stimulant.<br>  <br>  But, to tell you the truth, the stuff sold in most supermarkets is not that great.  Consider, getting the good stuff via mail order.  Here is a list of REALLY good jerky.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbeefjerky.org/search/label/Best" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbeefjerky.org/search/labe...</a><br>  <br>  I'd recommend the stuff from Rives Meats.  Best jerky I ever tasted.  Costs roughly what you would pay for the crap sold in the grocery store, if you buy several pounds at once.  If you like spicy food, you'll love the Chicago style.  I've had the barbecue and the teryaki also...both wonderful.  Ironically, I have not tried the plain old, normal jerky from them yet.  But, based on my experience with the others, I bet it's great.<br>  <br>  The Hunters Sticks are OK too.  Not as good as the jerky.  Also, they are high in fat.  Unlike the jerky which is extremely high quality, ultra-lean beef.  Very nice.|`|Tryf71mtaa	Jello Nonfat Pudding Mix....YUM!!!!| :D

8OJPm0Vsaa	Okay so you might get swamped by people who advertise acai berry on here in a moment.<br>  <br>  Here's the truth, I fell for one of those people and bought it. <br>  It does actually work, but it helps with skin more than weight loss.<br>  In 2 weeks, I noticed my skin was glowing and I barely needed makeup any-more. <br>  <br>  Weight-loss: I lost 2ibs in the first 2days which meant water weight, not fat. Acai berry is a powerful antioxidant that will not likely have weight-loss results, but it really does help your mood and skin! A better mood=more likely to make better food and workout decisions (ahh they got us!)<br>  <br>  Me, I would actually order it again but for skin, not weight-loss.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|TUkDOIR0aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

wuZXqYPGaa	hmm well im not a fan of intense workouts either.. and whut i do everyday that helps improve my body overtime is:<br>  a) always having healthy food in my house, if all i have is healthy food then i wont be tempted to eat crap.. always have small snacks inbetween main meals so that you wont go crazy eating lots on main meals and b) for workouts, just do some small workouts in the morning before you go to school and before you go to bed like even 20 situps and 10 pushups.. it may seem like nothing BUT TRUST me over time, you will c a difference. even running around a couple of blocks,, anthin will do :) wish u all the best|`|CENBZINeaa	1st off, drink lots n' lots of WATER!  Try to cut out soft-drinks n' juice n' sports-drinks.  I think that people, often times, underestimate their liquid calorie intake.  Also, try to eat more slowly and eat smaller portions.  Too, eat more fruits, vegetables, n' whole grains.  Also, snacking, in my view, is bad.  If you must snack, have an apple or some raw carrots or celery.  As a teen, I realize that beer-drinking may be a new part of life.  That's totally normal, but beer has a LOT of calories n' carbs.  Try to skip dessert, usually.  I recommend that you get at least 25-45 minutes of exercise/day.  If you don't like jogging, you can walk, ride a bike, swim, jump rope, play pick-up basketball, etc.  The most important thing, in my opinion, is to be realistic n' patient.  You ain't gonna lose weight in a day or a week--it may take several months.  Also, if you're feeling hungry, even after you've had a meal, try taking a walk, or drinking a big glass of water, or chewing bubblegum.  <br>  <br>  I was pretty fat as a teen (borderline obese) and I have had to make serious/permanent life-long life-style changes to keep the weight off.  Also, vanity aside, there are an whole plethora of health problems related to being overweight.  I hope this has been helpful and that you achieve your goal.  Try to keep looking forward and stay disciplined.  It can be real difficult, though.  Good luck!

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|uFcjDKIDaa	OMG!!!I weigh the same thang and I'm 14 and 5'0 and I'm a stick!|`|MjIdLpZDaa	GAINING IS AS HARD AS LOSEING<br>  <br>  okay so here is what to try and eat alot of healthy fat like peanut butter and proteins sutch as turkey and tofu and cheese drink milk <br>  <br>  it's hard to gain if you dont eat :( your motabilism must be fast<br>  <br>  what i want to know is how you got so thin in the first place?|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	There won't be a lot you can do. I'd assume you have a very fast metabilism, meaning you process food fast. Eat lots of protien and carbs. I'd would suggest a few slices of toasted whole wheat bread with peanut butter every morning for at least a month. See if that helps!!
mdV0oXATaa	eat enough food so your body doesnt store the limited food you eat as fat, plus you might not be burning just fat, maybe you burn muscle, which is why you lost weight but dont look skinnier|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Something you left out is diet.

It sounds like you work out a decent amount, and are very active and healthy, I would think that when you gain sme more height, it will even out.|`|rQGpAvDAaa	I would diet. Like someone else said muscle weighs more than fat, but do you want to be healthy and a little chubby but have muscle, or slender, no muscle and non healthy.<br>  <br>  As for your running, my cousin is a star runner and he wakes up every morning and runs for like an hour. In his free time he rides his bike. He is in college, but instead of  running in the morning you can run at night, but run every day if you want to lose weight and become faster.<br>  <br>  Doing sit ups will build muscles! And push ups!|`|y0pm4DJHaa	a great way to lose weight and lose it healthy is to do high intensity interval training which is go max run for 45 seconds and slow walking for a minute
THwVItleaa	I think that they have a cure. Just think about it if everybody who had Cancer went in ti be treated for it then the Gov. and the Economy would lose millions of $ bc they would not have to use there machines  any of there treatments.|`|XuDd4QYBaa	There is a cure! the government hides it from us because if the "cure" was "found" the population would grow dramatically.

It's not that simple, yet as we get closer to curing cancer, we are finding new ways to help cancer patients live more comfortably with it.<br>  <br>  Plus, people are starting to survive more and more from cancer. So we're makeing progress, it just can't happen over night.<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>      Theories about how the government is hiding stuff from the public is all fun and all but rather unrealistic. <br>       If it were true that the government was hiding that type of information, that would mean that only a select people would know about it. There are large amounts of people who are studying medicines and sciences, and working to find the cure for cancer. It's pretty odd that no one has come out and said it...other then...of course...the people working to hide it *eye roll*.<br>       And another thing, I had no idea marijuana CURED tons of diseases. lol it just helps ease the pain. It doesn't actually cure anything.
X9FrU4hTaa	Feeling your own, or another person's skin is not an accurate way to check for a fever.<br>  You need a thermometer to check for a fever.<br>  1) Do you feel ill?<br>  2) Have you been chilling ?<br>  If you are feeling ill and are concerned you may have a fever you can take your temperature or call your Dr to dicuss  your concerns.

The most weight a body should lose per week is about 2lbs. so instead of taking one month, it should take you about 2.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!

Do not let yourself go to sleep before nine or wake up late, no matter how bad you slept the night before.  One of the best things that I ever did was wake up early every day and go and exercise.

Do not drink caffeine past noon, or drink any of the "super caffeinated" sodas, like monster.<br>  <br>  I have been an insomniac ever since I can remember, I used to have weeks where I would only sleep a couple of hours every night or go two or three days without really sleeping at all.

MeeJWmGtaa	The dead walk among us. Zombies, ghouls—no matter what their label—these somnambulists are the greatest threat to humanity, other than humanity itself. To call them predators and us prey would be inaccurate. They are a plague, and the human race their host. The lucky victims are devoured, their bones scraped clean, their flesh consumed. Those not so fortunate join the ranks of their attackers, transformed into putrid, carnivorous monsters. Conventional warfare is useless against these creatures, as is conventional thought. The science of ending life, developed and perfected since the beginning of our existence, cannot protect us from an enemy that has no “life” to end. Does this mean the living dead are invincible? No. Can these creatures be stopped? Yes. Ignorance is the undead’s strongest ally, knowledge their deadliest enemy.<br>  <br>  We must begin by separating fact from fiction. The walking dead are neither a work of “black magic” nor any other supernatural force. Their origin stems from a virus known as Solanum, a Latin word used by Jan Vanderhaven.<br>  <br>  The disease was first recorded by Jan Vanderhaven while traveling through South America. He describes those infected with the disease as bearing festering sores, mottled skin, and decomposing flesh. He said victims show no rational thought or recognition of anything previously familiar to the victim. They neither sleep nor drink water, and reject all food apart from living prey. The infected will attempt to eat all living human prey that it observes. Vanderhaven describes seeing a hospital orderly throw a live rat at an infected individual, who then consumed the rat whole.<br>  <br>  Solanum is described as working by traveling through the bloodstream from the point of entry to the brain, where the virus replicates in the cells of the frontal lobe, thus turning the frontal lobe into an entirely new organ that does not need food, water, or even air to survive; it can be described as a completely self-sufficient organism.<br>  <br>  Their one and only goal after being infected will be to find and devour other individuals. The only way to stop this is to destroy the brain or remove the head. Note that if the zombie is decapitated, the head still remains a threat.<br>  <br>  The symptoms occur in the following order. The timeline may be several hours off, depending on the number and location of the bites, and the size and resistance of the victim.<br>  <br>  Hour 1- Pain and discoloration of the infected area. Immediate clotting of the wound.<br>  <br>  Hour 5- Fever between 99 F. and 103 F. Chills, slight dementia, vomiting, and acute pain in the joints.<br>  <br>  Hour 8- Numbing of extremities and infected area, increased fever from 103 F to 106 F. increased dementia, loss of muscular coordination<br>  <br>  Hour 11- Paralysis in the lower body, overall numbness, slowed heart rate<br>  <br>  Hour 16- Coma<br>  <br>  Hour 20- Cardiac arrest, cessation of brain activity<br>  <br>  Hour 23- Reanimation<br>  <br>  Solanum is extremely contagious and 100% fatal. Physical contact with infected blood or saliva always result in infection. Ingestion of infected flesh results in permanent death unless the victim has open mouth sores. Solanum is fatal to all living organisms, though humans are the only organisms that will reanimate. Parasitic insects, such as mosquitoes, reject infected hosts 100% of the time. All animals will instinctively run, swim or fly away from zombies.<br>  <br>  > There are no such things as zombies!<br>  <br>  Typical attitude of a future zombie victim. Well, we'll see who's got the last laugh when the walking dead are sucking up your nutritious, supple brains then.<br>  <br>  Key West, Florida, 1935<br>  On Labor Day, September 2, 1935, a major hurricane bore down on the Florida Keys, a string of islands separating the Gulf of Mexico from the Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane, one of only two Category 5 storms ever recorded in the United States, made landfall at Key West, the most populous of the keys. As day turned to night, heavy rains and winds of over 150 miles an hour rolled over the island, destroying virtually everything standing. Amid the destruction, infected rats began roaming the island, and by morning, the first of the zombies appeared. Many islanders mistook the zombies for dazed hurricane survivors and the plague spread across the island like wildfire. To make matters worse, the roads and bridges connecting the keys to the mainland had been washed out by the storm. The islanders had no way to escape. Scores of people drowned when they chose to leap into the choppy surf rather than face the voracious zombies.<br>  <br>  Within days, FVZA troops from all over the south converged on Key West in a variety of sea craft. They established a beachhead on the south side of the island and went about the process of extermination. It took three weeks to secure the island. A total of 3500 people were infected and destroyed.<br>  <br>  Vicksburg, Mississippi, 1863<br>  1863 was the pivotal year of the American Civil War. The Union army, sensing victory, tried to deal a knockout blow to the Confederacy by taking control of the Mississippi River. After New Orleans fell to the Union, the city of Vicksburg remained as the last Confederate holdout on the big river. On May 18, 1963, 3200 Union troops arrived off the coast of Vicksburg and demanded an immediate surrender. But Confederate leaders refused, and the Union laid siege to the city. A month of heavy bombardment ensued.<br>  On June 17, city residents spotted the first zombie, and within days, dozens were wandering about. This development hardly worried the 30,000 Confederate troops protecting the city; they entertained themselves by conducting target practice on the zombies. But with their supply lines cut off, the Confederate troops soon ran out of ammunition, and the zombies kept coming. To this day, Southerners claim that the Union let the zombie plague continue out of pure malice. In any case, when Union forces entered the city on July 3, hundreds of zombies were roaming the streets, many in Confederate Army uniforms. As there was no FVZA at this time, the Union soldiers had to do the killing and they quickly found out that zombies, unlike soldiers, do not surrender. In the end, an estimated 2000 people were infected and destroyed at Vicksburg, almost as many as were killed in the Battle of Bull Run.<br>  <br>  Hawaii, 1892<br>  Queen Lili'uokalani<br>  At the beginning of the 1890s, Hawaii found itself in a tug of war between native islanders, who wanted the islands to remain independent, and powerful sugar growers who wanted to join the United States. Queen Lili'uokalani ascended to the throne in 1891 and promptly enacted a series of measures designed to weaken the influence of the sugar growers. However, her mind was soon occupied by different matters: in August of 1892, a zombie plague that had begun among Chinese laborers in the sugar cane fields of Oahu spread to Honolulu. Wave after wave of zombies came staggering out of the jungle, forcing desperate islanders to board outrigger canoes and flee to neighboring islands.<br>  <br>  Despite her fear of losing independence, the Queen had no choice but to ask the United States for help. A detachment of FVZA troops arrived in the fall and quickly wrested control of the city from the zombies. But the surrounding countryside proved more difficult to clear, and more FVZA agents were called in. The sugar growers took advantage of the chaos and panic by launching a coup, and the Queen was deposed. Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898.<br>  <br>  There has long been suspicion that the sugar growers let the plague go in order to destabilize the queen, a suspicion strengthened by the fact that the top growers left Hawaii shortly after the outbreak began. Whatever the case, Hawaii's 1893 zombie outbreak killed just under 2000 people, making it the third-worst in U.S. history.<br>  <br>  Don't be lulled into a false sense of security, thinking "oh, it could never happen here." It has, and will happen again. It's happening right now, all the time!|`|gSo4dR7oaa	There are no such things as zombies!

A full day's worth of meals help your metabolism running efficiently. <br>  <br>  Tuesday sounds good as well. Same thing with the protein, make sure it's whey.  <br>  <br>  Wednesday is on point. You should consider incorperating yoga with each other day.

Smart chick, very nice.   <br>  <br>  Sunday is good too, but dont' go so intense on teh cardio unless you need to.<br>  <br>  Ok one thing I haven't seen on this list is water. Make sure you're drinking enough water! It's good that you're eating fruits daily, that's very good. Try throwing in some dark veggies as well. I would also drink/eat something that has electrolytes since you're performing mostly intense cardio. **If you don't find it disgusting, Coconut water is excellent with electrolytes. It's all good, no bad, no fat, nothing it's amazing. Coming from a Caribbean, South American, and European decent, coconut lives with me forever lol. ZICO is amazing, give it a try.**|`|JKFphNoraa	looks like a healthy meal to me! :)|`|WniOOchkaa	All of the foods sound very healthy, but are you eating enough?  To stay on the healthy side and not add alot of bad calories/fat I think you should add some more fruit and veggies at least.  Also, I think at least one day you should have a "whatever" food (like ice cream) where you eat something that may not be very healthy, but it will keep you from completely cheating on your diet because you know you can "safely" cheat once a week.  Here's a few websites that tell how many calories you need a day...keep in mind too how many you burn during your workout.<br>  <a href="http://weightloss.about.com/od/eatsmart/a/blcalintake.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weightloss.about.com/od/eatsmart/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/dailycalorie-calc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shapefit.com/dailycalorie-cal...</a><br>  <a href="http://blog.nutritiondata.com/ndblog/2008/08/how-many-calori.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.nutritiondata.com/ndblog/200...</a>
dnMXvVM3aa	I can't say if you have it or not.  But as for a blood test, ye sit will show.  Mono is caused by the Epstein Barr Virus.  Many lab tests can be run to see if you have it.  Good luck|`|0nyWiro9aa	Well there are several tests that might implicate infectious mono when one is symptomatic. The white cell count could be elevated with lymphocytosis and those lymphocytes might be atypical (>10%).<br>  Some children never develop a positive Mono test for the detection of heterophil antibodies. If the clinical situation appears to be mono and the above is suggestive then a specific serological test for EBV should be ordered. <br>  <br>  Not all infections are symptomatic ones and so there is no way in knowing whether your family has already been exposed to it or even gave it to you.
57OQemZLaa	Depersonalization disorder?<br>  It's kind of like going through the motions of things, but not really recalling anything. People with Depersonalization issues also feel a loss of sense of self, disconnected perceptions, which could explain why your percepttion changed to being in the corner of the room..etc.. Do you experience other memory blocks?|`|TRrTunqvaa	sure its strange.. but a lot of times the people who think differently are gunies|`|2zn4HikSaa	From personal experience, I can say this is normal.

Just give it a go. :D!|`|iko1uqBnaa	I lost 40lbs in 4 months just by doing this. I completely stopped drinking soda or pop (whatever) and started drinking fuse they have a lot of vitamins that help regulate your digestive system which is really important when trying to lose weight then don't have anything that is easy to eat nothing pre-made or microwavable that makes you have to really want to eat in order to have to cook plus you will guarantee that you are eating healthy that way and my last piece of advice is don't make any more than you need to eat for that meal so you can't have seconds (my biggest problem) and if you do make to much after you fix your plate and before you eat put the leftovers in the fridge that way by the time you are done eating the leftovers are already cold and you have to reheat them and you'll think twice before doing so. By doing these simple things I (at 5'2")went from 170lbs to 120lbs from March to June last year and are still 120lbs, you will be hungry at first but after only a couple of days your stomach will shrink and you won't be able to eat more than you need and that small amount you eat will fill you up. P.S. I still ate the things I liked I just made it homemade and ate it in smaller portions. the idea before me about the goal clothes totally true I did use that also and it did keep me motivated but I would say not trying it on every day just when your willpower gets low so that way you will notice a big change when you need it not seeing only a little a day or not noticing any change with already low willpower may just make you give up.|`|P0Z2NvNgaa	Obviously lots of exercise. Then just follow this easy and broad diet<br>  Drink: Water, or watered down cranberry juice (not cocktail), NO soda, alcohol or coffee.<br>  Breakfast: Museli, Fat free yoghurt, low GI and low sugar cereal or fruit <br>  Snack: Fruit and almonds<br>  Lunch: Nothing fatty; look up salad recipes on the internet or in cookbooks, pasta with a healthy sauce or sandwiches.<br>  Snack: Fruit and almonds<br>  Dinner: Same as lunch (no fatty foods)<br>  <br>  Get lots of sleep and do things to make yourself feel good. <br>  Persist for a week and you will notice the difference!<br>  Don't eat chocolate or any junk food at all for the first 2 weeks, then you can have maybe a piece of chocolate a day.<br>  Make sure you have lots of support and feel proud.<br>  Sounds silly, but it actually works<br>  GOOD luck|`|RRr0BH6oaa	actually a great way to raise your metabolism is to eat in routine every day like eat the same time every day it gives your body an idea of when to start working on what you've consumed.<br>  Ex.<br>  breakfast at 10 am<br>  snack at 12 noon<br>  lunch 2 pm<br>  snack 4 pm<br>  dinner 6 pm<br>  snack 8 pm<br>  <br>  its amazing how much thats helped some people|`|6NatyWdyaa	I've been dieting lately and this is what I eat<br>  <br>  Breakfast-Bowl of special K i like the blueberry kind or 3 pieces of turkey bacon and 2 scrambled eggs with any fruit of your choice.<br>  <br>  lunch-south beach chicken Caesar wraps (they come in a box in the section with the hot dogs at wal-mart they are really good.<br>  <br>  dinner-baked fish or chicken  and a salad or any type of steamed vegetable I prefer a salad or steamed broccoli <br>  <br>  I drink water all day and sometimes i'll drink a vitamin water if I want to drink something sweet|`|JRAUyYl2aa	The simple answer to your question IS regular exercise, LOTS of veggies and fiber and cutting down on red meat. Unfortunately, after taking a nutrition class I found that there really is no such thing as a "healthy" diet program. It sucks but if you want to be healthy and loose weight thats the way to do it. Other ways can actually effect the way that your cells store and absorb fat which makes it WAY easier for you to gain weight as soon as you stop your diet program, not to mention it can be really bad for you. Sorry, no such thing as a quick fix.|`|jNEeriooaa	in the beginning of this year i was at 206 pounds i was tired of being picked on so i made it my new year resolution to loose weight right now im at 168. loosing weight is not a 1 day thing and it usually doesn't come fast. but it can be free i would suggest eating 5 meals a day usually 2 to 3 hours apart this will help boost your metabolism and you wont be Hungary. if you just starve yourself then your body will soon catch on and begin storing fat in your body when ever you do eat and that will just take you the opposite way. before every meal i drink one 8 oz glass of water and eat an apple. i get full a lot faster. exercising is crucial you have to burn more calories than your body intakes. its mainly mental buy a article of clothing that you cant fit but is where you want to be at and try it on everyday when you realize your getting closer and closer itell motivate you that much more to loose more. loosing is not too hard once you set your mind to it. i suggest you start going to a gym tho and lifting weights. although muscle weighs more then fat in order to develop muscle you will have to burn fat. which will help you alot. stay motivated and good luck. stay away from foods with alot of fat in them eat filling foods its mostly dieting|`|3q5SSIcUaa	Hello  I found the best way to lose weight fast was drink lots of water and some simple exercising.

AA10299265	Hypoglycemia and Candida Albicans are two entirely different conditions. Hypoglycemia is low blood sugar. Candida Albicans is a fungus (aka 'yeast') infection. Candida is one of many naturally occurring flora in the intestine. Candida overgrowth can occur when too much sugar (hyPERglycemia) is in the system or when doctors prescribe antibiotics which kill the bacteria that keep the candida growth in check. <br>  <br>  Hypoglycemia can result as a byproduct of 'metabolic syndrome' which is a precursor to type two diabetes. If I were you, I would get on a healthy, natural foods based diet and exercise program right now.

f8mLpPXlaa	It usually develops as a result of diverticulosis. The diverticulosis becomes inflamed from food getting stuck in there and becomes infected. this, if not treated would just get worse and erode the intestinal wall. Now you've got an ulcer. If it continues to be untreated it could further erode through the wall into the abdominal cavity where the infection could go anywhere and cause excruciating pain and death. This is not a pretty sight. But there are safe effective treatments that are commonly used today.
2sccbIDlaa	Hi Agi,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately you can't get rid of your mind, but I'm sure you already knew that, lol. But what you can do is learn to make your mind your friend and not the enemy. Mindfulness Meditation is based on some great techniques of accepting and acknowledging the thoughts that come to mind. Once we bring our awareness and breath to the thoughts, that in itself helps to disperse the energy of any preceding thoughts....Following is a quote<br>  <br>  "... it's about opening to what is, every moment ... and being able to fully open to whatever arises. That's all. It ain't about getting somewhere, having any particular sort of experience rather than another, however so called spiritual, or getting enlightened. No place to go, nobody to be ...just open and rest in the opening.Such a simple thing, so extraordinarily simple. Rest in what already is. without preference.then everything becomes possible." <br>  (simple post on a simple thing that is the key to all doors)<br>  <a href="http://luminousemptiness.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://luminousemptiness.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  The more we try and control a thought, the more control the thought has over us. We give it power that way. Instead, try letting go of controlling the thought. Just let it be. Accept it. Acknowledge it. Like a crying baby, our thoughts are just screaming for our attention and just want to be heard. Listen to what your thought might be trying to tell you. Might be a message underneath the surface. Only your soul knows what that means. <br>  <br>  Yoga, meditation and breathing techniques really help. Not sure what your age is, but if you really want to calm your mind, body and emotions, I'd highly recommend signing up for yoga classes or at the very least drop in on one class in your area. <br>  <br>  Walking in nature helps me to clear my mind too. Sometimes when you find yourself so wrapped up in your thoughts, it helps to get out and get a breath of fresh air. Walking by a lake or body of water works for me, and oh did I mention sunshine!! Sunshine clears the aura too, and provides your body with Vitamin D. Just an hour a day is beneficial.<br>  <br>  A more gentle approach can be found in homeopathic flower essences. You can purchase a bottle for about $10-15 canadian normally - - Heres a couple links to bach remedy sites for more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.bachflower.com/Rescue_Remedy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bachflower.com/Rescue_Remedy....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.1-800homeopathy.com/topics/mental.html?sub=bachflower" rel="nofollow">http://www.1-800homeopathy.com/topics/me...</a><br>  <br>  Depending on what your current state of mind is, If I knew more I could recommend the ones that would work best for you however you can read thru the list and determine which ones suit you. <br>  <br>  I can give you a wealth of info if you like, or book recommendations.

It's called plan B, and you can get it without a prescription if you're over 18. It's best taken within 72 hours of your, um, emergency. Contraceptives are most reliable when they're taken correctly, but they're not 100% effective.|`|dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	I would say the chances are higher than that.

sTdlAMv7aa	Best direct way to raise testosterone: lift weights.  Assuming you have a good foundation in weightlifting (i.e. 3-6 months), start lifting heavier weights for 4-5 sets performing 4-8 reps per set.  That can increase testosterone levels (either free testosterone or total testosterone) by up to 40%.  <br>  <br>  One supplement that raises testosterone (albeit slightly- maybe 25-50ng/dL) is Tribulus terrestris.<br>  <br>  Other methods involve avoiding activities that lower/inactivate testosterone. <br>  <br>  Testosterone converts to estrogen.  Prevent excessive conversion of T to E to grant T its full effect.  Some products that minimize this process are<br>  <br>  (Supplement) Chrysin<br>  Resveratrol (in red wine); also a supplement<br>  Zinc (may also help raise testosterone)<br>  <br>  Ways to eliminate estrogen faster:<br>  Eat broccoli<br>  (Supplement) Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C)<br>  (Supplement) Di-inodlyl-methane (DIM)<br>  <br>  Get adequate sleep.  Testosterone production decreases with sleep deprivation.<br>  <br>  Beware most chemicals when possible, as fumes from paint thinner, as well as various drugs like painkillers, can lower testosterone.  & beware overtraining/marathons- those activities can significantly lower testosterone too.|`|U7cJYik4aa	refrain from masturbation. Absorb vitamin E. eat iron rich products|`|XgO9HUm9aa	Brocolli will boost your testostorone levels.
fwpu4jL3aa	You can lose a lot of weight just by changing the way that you eat. <br>  One of the easiest ways to lose weight is to eat less food but more often. The way I do this is to divide my daily calorie maximum by six. Here’s an example.<br>  <br>  Let’s say that I want to lose weight by eating only 1200 calories per day. Instead of eating 3 meals a day of 400 calories each, I’m going to do it differently.<br>  <br>  Instead, I’m going to eat 6 meals a day of 200 calories each.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008/07/23/how-should-i-eat-if-im-trying-to-lose-a-lot-of-weight/" rel="nofollow">http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...</a>|`|Z4Y0jaONaa	its recommended to lose 2pounds a week...this obviously varies among people...but generally is the healthiest way....just gotta make sure you actually follow through your workout and your PROPER diet...<br>  muscle doesnt weigh more than fat by the way.....answer me this:what weighs more 1pound of fat or 1pound of muscle....they are the same right. well the difference is that muscle is dense(closely packed together) and fat is dispersed...|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>  <br>  Learn More:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>

e55785613f452742affcce816c46ec70aa	i started losing weight at about ur age, during highschool. so after school, i would walk home, every day. if you live kind of far from the school..take the bus and get off at an earlier stop, and walk from there. if you can, try and get a friend to walk with you every day, its a great way to stay motivated. cut all junk food out of your diet. even sodas. if you can, start bringing your own lunch to school, or opt for a more healthy choice from the cafeteria. i always got a sandwich and a bottle of water. and start drinking plenty of water, its better for u anyways. <br>  <br>  dont look for a fast result, itll take time. and please note that your still young, your body is still developing and growing..so wanting to get in shape and stay healthy is great at any age, but also, this extra weight you might be carrying may just fall off you once youre older. focus on getting healthier, not thinner. the slimming down is a reward for becoming healthier. <br>  <br>  and about ur step-bro, im not going to tell you to have a heart to heart with him, cuz i doubt that would happen. instead, poke fun at him..and ask him how he likes it. its hard to ignore it when theyre in your face, i know, so tell him to back off.<br>  hope this helps...good luck...|`|1f82fb147ded57ab3319b85a426f74d3aa	hmm. i don't have a six pack and i don't need one since i'm a female. but my brother is seventeen and he works out with teens one or two years younger than him for service hours. basically what i'm trying to say is that i know some techniques you can use to lose weight and have a six pack. plus my ex has a six pack and he's recently 16.<br>  <br>  - lay on the floor like a stick, hands on side. bring legs up to make a 90 degree angle. make sure your legs are somewhat perfectly straight. then, with your legs starting creating "scissor" motions. this seems to work great.<br>  - tea is also good to drink fafter having a meal. allegedly hot drinks after a meal can capture some fats and dispense them<br>  - jogging/running gets rid of the extra skin and fat. so it's a good plus. <br>  - crunches and sit-ups may help. but the scissors work best for my ex's experience<br>  <br>  and if you like to dance, dancing is a great exercise. my brother and ex break and rave so they're active.|`|294bf204d775cd0cac714b9d086dfb56aa	i feel that ways sometimes but  u just have to get over it|`|612926de5b27a4a008b8a1238178377daa	youve got to realise that your brother has latched on to what makes you insecure and is playing on it to piss you off! thats what brothers and sisters do. <br>  if you had a six pack blah blah he'd find something else to tease you about.<br>  we all have body hang ups and although i think its really really cool youre doing something about it, make sure u set ure self achievable goals or ull get angry at ureself for not meeting unatainable targets.<br>  i cant give u any exercise advice but stay healthy look after yourself ok! x|`|0c1315a6656b10c16011720953f6b1daaa	Go swimming.

It's not your fault. <br>  <br>  I have included some websites which will help you to understand why this is happening and provide information and help for you. Included is a forum where you can talk to people who share your problem so will be able to understand and help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|TA6rYZpiaa	you're confused...you dont know what to do with you're feelings so you take it out on yourself.Dont...if u love yourself you'd stop.That person who did that to you already hurt you so why are YOU hurting yourself?It's not your fault so let it go.LET IT GO!|`|lSGhyEneaa	It isn't your fault... please find help in any way possible.

cAGv5evLaa	I have this same problem. It's called Tonsil Crypts, and can be described as swollen tonsils with "crypts" or cavities in them which catch food as you swallow it. This is gonna sound gross, but eventually the food starts going bad - it will turn white and become hardened and give you bad breath because of the bacteria in your saliva breaking it down (at that point, they are called "tonsil stones"). Unfortunately, the only way to cure it is to get your tonsils out. <br>  Note that this is not the same as tonsilitis, and you will not feel sick or have a sore throat or any other symptoms. It also has nothing to do with lymph nodes.<br>  It's gross, I know, and I'm sorry to say it doesn't go away on its own - in fact it may get worse if your tonsils get more swollen or the crypts get bigger. If it really bothers you, you should get your tonsils removed.<br>  Don't listen to the people on here trying to freak you out saying you need to go to the doctor ASAP - they don't know what they're talking about - it's not dangerous, no more than a neusance. The worst it could do is give you a scratchy throat from time to time.|`|GmTs1BB1aa	that's disgusting.<br>  go see a doctor. now.|`|WchGezIAaa	odds are it may be an infection. or a problem with your lymph nodes. (AKA tonsils) They could also be Adenoids~<br>  I would go see your local GP<br>  odds are you may need a course of antibiotics. or even the surgical removal of your adenoids.<br>  <br>  But I don't know it all.

No one produces things they need to spit out every so many months. <br>  <br>  Go see an ENT (eye nose throat doctor) as soon as possible and describe what's happening.

af8c00fa447986e7bbd8bf088de0b475aa	well hun, it might be best if you told us your weight first....but I would check out www.glamour.com because they have a healthy weight gauge, where you can put in your age, weight, height, etc. and it will tell you if it is a healthy weight or not. I think it's around 150 for your height (I'm the same age and height also) when it becomes overweight.|`|AA12074695	If you have loose weight you might want to lose some weight.|`|3b124bd6357b8aec72dbc5d792ec36e4aa	umm...how much do u weigh|`|dc50667d174cd4d58c243210c0d5a4fbaa	I think she was the one who said she weighs 125 pounds.

01Mu3wUeaa	I think it's perverted for guys to like females to be shaved "down there" as it resembles a child's "area".|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No it's not considered creepy. It's common to shave but AFAIK lots of people don't. I agree it looks a bit weird all shaven. Don't worry I don't shave it all off and I've never had a problem with guys, I've even been told the hair is soft and nice. Then again I don't hang around with shallow picky guys so other people might not be so tolerant, but I don't really care about them.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|ciQjwtTcaa	its scary haha.<br>  but ...your the one that deals with it everyday...so whatever floats your boat. <br>  =] enjoy your body.|`|C3yE261uaa	look how many girls are in men's health lol yes I shave down there and I'm a girl|`|5d1b54e3efed93f0e4984edefdd98aa7aa	Yes...shave it up!|`|0KGJRVMNaa	I don't think it's "freaky", that's ridiculous. <br>  I think that it depends on the person and the amount of body hair they have. For example, if a guy has a lot of chest hair or hair down his stomach, he would probably look better just trimmed. Some guys look better with no hair at all.<br>  <br>  I don't see how it looks like a prepubescent child when people have no hair. And that girl that said guys who like no hair on girls are perverted.. are you kidding? Like damn.. that's crazy.|`|95c2929336859361a8f5aac01e713a06aa	No, it's more of a turn-on for me when it's natural. It makes me feel like I'm with a woman, not a child. If that's freaky, I'm not concerned. It's creepy when there's no hair, like changing a diaper.<br>  I wish more women asked that question.|`|IY9JolQ4aa	ewww sick Pubic hair is almost not socially acceptable I feel. I don't shave it bare, but I trim it up a lot. It's just a turn on to not have to see a big hairy beast!! Shave that beast!!!|`|UjIsNvubaa	You do what you want to.I prefer a clean shaven woman or<br>  one that is trimmed. I'm a male and I shave mine every day.|`|yEDR0fnOaa	More people tell me they do trim down there than don't. Trimming is a lot better than shaving.|`|eMPeOsRBaa	yes.. you really need to start shaving 'down there'.|`|PzpArc0vaa	for me not at all.. i think its really weird to shave it eh but thats just me|`|hQHWVRyTaa	Nope, not at all|`|bixGqZI4aa	It's all about personal preference. Yours and your partner's. <br>  <br>  I keep it trimmed all the way down (like with hair clippers with no clip on because bald causes be bumps), and I won't go down on my wife unless she's totally shaven. But that's just me. <br>  Some guys prefer all natural, trimmed, landing strip, bald, etc. <br>  <br>  But, it's your body. If yu don't feel comfortable bald, then you do what you're comfortable with. Screw everyone else- it's your body, not theirs.|`|IikDr2Elaa	The truth is a lot of guys get grossed out by body hair...especially pubic hair. But as long as its "trimmed" and not abnormally hairy its usually not a big deal to them...it really depends on the guy because every one has different opinions. However I will say DO NOT SHAVE DOWN THERE because it causes ingrown hairs. In that area in particular the hair gets thick and when you shave it cuts at an angle so its almost guarenteed to cause ingrown hair after a while. If you do decide to remove the hair wax it...its worth it|`|0eef821e877b14d3114ed09c28394a80aa	Trimming yes, shaving no....it's itchy when it grows back and honestly I wouldn't feel womanly down there "bald", plus it provides some cushion of sorts. It does all come down to personal preference but what you have to remember is that on the average, people's bits don't look like a magazine centerfold. So please don't use that as a marker for what you think is normal because it's not.|`|Kbj0Lhxfaa	I know that where i am from it is normal to shave your good bits. but if you trim it up a bit that is fine as well.  maybe you can even spice it up a bit by trimming a design in there like an arrow or the first letter of your name. not to mention it's a lot more comfortable when you're bumping uglies.|`|WprZJUxHaa	Well every guys opinion is going to be different but I believe most guys like their women shaved? at least trimmed up. Personally I prefer the bermuda triangle or the landing strip. the buckweat is just too much for me... ew. And if you enjoy oral sex then it would make more sense to shave down there.|`|gHUSM4x7aa	Everyone has their preferences, but now at days shaved is more common. For me having hair there is not a turnoff unless theirs way to much but i prefer with little to no hair.|`|MNHSiWARaa	Don't worry about it, hairy feet are perfectly normal.|`|Cl1ROECWaa	i like a very nice trimmed landing strip kinda look|`|YBqr3irpaa	the question every girl wants to know  the answer to....|`|E64juLwJaa	I only sleep with dudes who are totally shaved.<br>  Otherwise no game!!!!<br>  Colors
dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	I don't believe that anyone is a freak. We are all different for a reason. School is rough on a lot of people but peers can make it much harder. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. There is nothing wrong with being different. Being different is what makes us who we are. Don't waste your tears on them and don't let them know that they get to you and really don't let them. Just be you and if they don't like it then shame on them. Don't worry so much about what other people think and just remember this, after graduation, you will not see most of those people ever again. Be yourself and be happy about who you are. The only person who's opinion counts is your own so do what makes you happy.|`|5tVnmOmRaa	tell your parents these things. get help.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	People, especially teenagers, never know what they are talking about. Looking back on high school people were mean to everyone. I always tried not to take things personally, since the people who said mean things about me really didn't know anything about who I really was. So, no matter what people say about you, don't pay attention to it. <br>  Also, talk to a councilor or your doctor and let them know how sad you are so you can get some anti-depressants. They make worlds of difference.<br>  I'm sorry you're having such a hard time in high school. Just know that it ends and people grow up and change. Your life is more valuable than it may seem because afterwards there is nothing (that we know of). This is your one and only chance, so don't ruin it.|`|XhtDtZK9aa	First of all don't let anyone make you feel less of yourself,your an individual ,different from everyone else.

PpKJIT0aaa	Not doing my thing, but once when I was 13, mum came into the room and told me off for not making my bed (I'd forgotten to do it, even though she had asked earlier in the day), and she said, well, you have to make it, like I asked you too. And I go: errr... I'm not wearing anything.<br>  <br>  I was half-erect as well, so naturally didn't wanna get out of bed. <br>  <br>  She goes: It doesn't matter; you have to make your bed. Now move it.<br>  <br>  So I reluctantly got out, still half-mast; and thought to myself, if she says anything, I'm going to die. She didn't, luckily.|`|FNiWMyhkaa	Yeh, was about 3 year ago , my older brother walked in my bedroom while i was there wanking on me bed watching a porno, i quickly tryed to turn it off but it was too late and i didnt even deny what i was doing when he laughed, i was sorta in shock but then thought so **** its normal.|`|GJFBsG62aa	I've had quite the number of close encounters, but have yet to be caught wankin. <br>  I intend to keep things that way:P|`|i6RlYFo7aa	mum walked in on me wanking<br>  very emberassing|`|YtRB9Mhtaa	Caught by the city police, campus security, and the state police... but it was okay, because I was over 18 and so was my husband.

If new start with 8-12 reps of each with no rest.Then rest 30 secs, then another circuit. If not new you can start with 12-15 reps and 3 circuits. Trust me, you won't need no treadmill to get your heart pumping. Conventional cardio is overrated anyway.Interval training is the way to go.

uDZZLH0Uaa	i totally understand as i had a tooth pulled on  mar 4th 09. all was fine but after about 6 hours i noticed it was still bleeding so i went back to the dentist and he packed it with more gause and told me not to remove it for 30 minuites. so after 30 minuites i did take it out and it seemed ok and by sat it was hurting so bad clear in to my other teeth i went back and he said it was a dry socket so he packed it with a dressing and a pain killer which tasted awful but in about 10 minuites the pain was gone and i took the gause out after about 30-40 min and it felt better. the taste was bad but i would rather have the bad taste than the pain...<br>  the next day i rinced with salt water gentley and the dressing came out when i spit so i called the dentist back and they told me if the pain was unbarable to come back in for another dressing. so far i have made it with minamal pain but if its still hurting on momday i will return to the dentist . this can take up to 10 days to heal up where there is no pain so its a waiting game. go to  <a href="http://www.animated-teeth.com/dry-sockets/a1-dry-sockets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animated-teeth.com/dry-socket...</a> or<br>   <a href="http://www.animated-teeth.com/tooth_extractions/t7_instructions_post-op.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animated-teeth.com/tooth_extr...</a><br>  if you cant get these to work then type in to google dental dry sockets and it will give you a few sites to check out.<br>  <br>  i cant beleive im going thru this as i have had teeth pulled when i was younger and never had any trouble . t tooth was not a wisdom tooh so contrary to what my article says about that it does happen to other teeth and i am over 40 yrs old too and i am female...<br>  i wish you all the best on this and to heal fast<br>  cheers<br>  mystic|`|9snxL5MMaa	Rinse your mouth with Betadine solution or Povidone Iodine solution along with warm salt water rinses...just gently swish the water and betadine solution around the area of the dry socket...and plz don't spit it out just drop ur head down and let it flow out o its own..<br>  Avoid sodas..hot and hard food..rinking with a straw..fingering the area..or anything which will dislodge the clot...and ya avoid spitting...<br>  <br>  Pathfinder!!|`|IhFWgO5Naa	The tooth socket should be clean with antiseptic then some medicine that will help in the infection should be put in the socket.

Something you eat could cause you to bloat and make it seem like you're gaining instead of losing. The best thing I can tell you is to weight yourself one day a week at the same time of day (usually after you go to the restroom and before you do anything else). Just remember to adjust your diet when you reach the weight you want. Here's a tip that my uncle gave me (he was a body builder for years). When I'm dieting he told me I can cheat once a week, like I could have one fountain coke or one sundae or something so I don't feel like I am denying myself sweets. This is supposed to help keep you on the wagon long term. Hope it works out for you!
YtRB9Mhtaa	Both of your medications could be involved.  The best thing to do would be to schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your concerns, they might be able to prescribe something else.  <br>  <br>  While Colchicine is used to treat arthritis, it is also used to treat Peyronie's disease (penis curvature and pain); it is possible that it could cause problems with delayed ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Lisinopril usually decreases men's ability to have or keep erections, but it can cause loss of sexual ability, desire, drive, performance... it would be worth talking to your doctor about it.  <br>  <br>  There has been some research connecting erectile dysfunction and arthritis, but most people think it correlates more to the use of NSAID pain relievers than just having arthritis.  I did not see anything specific about delayed erection and NSAID use, but your rheumatologist should have the most recent information.  <br>  <br>  Just in general, as you age, your reflexes slow down and it takes longer plus the nerve endings in your penis become less sensitive causing it to take longer, too.  WebMD.com has a really good guide on overcoming ejaculation problems.  They give some specific tips on ways to masturbate to help with delayed ejaculation (it's not your typical try and get to orgasm masturbation technique either).  <br>  <br>  The site recommends a really good book, "All Night Long: How to Make Love to a Man Over 50."  I know you are 41, but your wife might find some information that she likes in there if you can deal with it saying fifty on the cover.|`|1C123Xdsaa	It most probably is the meds. Read the little leaflet that comes with the prescription. It will have a list of common, not so common, and rare side effects. Side effects you experience depends very much on the person, and the dosage. It could be that the dosage is too high for you. Tell your Dr. and they should lower the dose.<br>  <br>  It could also be psychological, you could have developed a mental block recently for some reason. Age could be a factor of course.|`|TsjqzanQaa	It is probably a combination of factors, including the medication.<br>  <br>  Diminished sexual sensitivity from circumcision is also a major factor.<br>  <br>  Circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity by an average of 50-75% in most cases, and more in others.<br>  <br>  Throughout the lifetime, the circumcised man's glans and surrounding tissues that were meant by nature to be covered and kept moist and sensitive, dry out and keratinize.      This keratinization continues throughout<br>  the victim's lifetime, and sexual sensitivity continually declines, slowly and inexorably.<br>  <br>  I had more than the usual loss of sexual sensitivity resulting from the mutilation of circumcision, and couldn't achieve orgasm at all in normal sex.<br>  <br>  Foreskin restoration has also restored much of my lost sensitivity, and has also increased the intensity of orgasms, as well.       It increased my libido and is like having a new penis.<br>  <br>  Restoration doesn't restore the amputated nerve endings and doesn't restore the damaged and severed veins and blood vessels, but it dekeratinizes the glans and the new inner foreskin is especially sensitive.<br>  <br>  As I said before, this is probably a combination of things, but your sex life isn't over at just 41, and you can consider foreskin restoration.<br>  <br>  Also, look at your medications and ask the pharmacist about sexual side effects.      There is usually some literature enclosed with medications that has some of the side effects listed.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Well, Bubba!  Sometimes medications can cause havoc with your sex life & one of them is high blood pressure medicine. TRY THIS:  No smoking, no beer/ale, no booze, no drugs, no junk food, no fast food garbage, no sugary sweet soda's.  Get on a good, healthy, balanced diet including lots of boiled or steamed vegetables.  Drink plenty of water, fruit juices & fat free milk.  Snack on lots of RAW fruit & veggies.  Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner.  Within 90 days you should be able to tell a noticeable difference all the way around.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	DUDE...Lisionpril has three possible side effects and Erectile Ejaculation Dysfunction is one of them...I took Lisinopryl and developed that and a constant dry cough... another doctor took me off that stuff and put me on ExForge 10/160 and it works great keeping my BP down and No Side Effects...|`|PpKJIT0aaa	It's ya meds.

TORBP6QIaa	She is likely allergic to one of the additives in the pills...probably the colour dye....ask you Chemist to check if there is any different ingredient in them that may have caused this reaction.  Probably a good idea to go back to the doctor too and show them the rash on her legs.  I would say she needs to stop taking these pills ASAP but as you dont have any others thats not an option until you get the regular brand that she isnt allergic to. The Benadryl etc is a good course of treatment for you to do for your daughter.  I remember being itchy all the time when I started warfarin but it went away after a fewweeks and has not bothered me at all in the last 3 years.<br>  <br>  There is a website especially for valve patients you both might be interested in as well.

dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	I've been on mine for 2 years and my doctor hasn't mentioned anything. Here's something I found that should help:<br>  <br>  Will long term pill use cause infertility or pregnancy problems?<br>  <br>  Can remaining on birth control pills for a long time affect your chances of becoming pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term in cases where there are no other identified risk factors?<br>  <br>  No. Basically pills cover up whatever your body would have done over the time you took them, but they don't alter what your natural history is. For example, if you take pills from age 20 to 35 and then stop, your chances of getting pregnant are the same as any 35 year old who just started trying. At 35 it may be slightly more difficult to get pregnant but the pills don't cause it; age or other intervening disease or circumstances does.|`|1xFwfz5Raa	I had the depo shot for over 2 years and my doctor made me stop taking it because of severe side effects (loss of bone density) i think it would be smart to talk to your doctor, the pill is a lot diff from the shot but you should try a diff form of birth control.

It mimics many other things that could be happening.  One that does know they have it should be on the same diet as a diabetic though..no sugar for one thing.<br>  What happens with hypo pts is that when they eat too much sugar their body produces too much insulin and therefore burns off the sugar so fast that the level drops to the hypo stage.<br>  In a diabetic it is the reverse...they eat sugar but their body does NOT produce enough insulin therefore the sugar overloads in their body.<br>  A lot offf sugar and caffeine can cause jittery, restlessness feelings which could have caused hers.

T8P2sXMGaa	Hi,<br>  Im a fellow anxiety sufferer as well, and i wanna let you know that while your anxiety over "spacing out" may not always be justified, it still is quite normal for someone living with an anxiety disorder. What you are feeling, has generated from the fact that you have begun to doubt yourself a lot, and find it hard to see yourself in the moment.. you begin to "space" essentially.. because this eases the pain of dealing with whatever it is thats bothering you.<br>  and i do it all the time.. half of it.. i like to think is because im very in touch with my reality and my emotions.. but the other part i know is because my anxiety keeps me on EDGE and just like you.. very panicky.<br>  what i recommend-<br>  1) is to stop judging yourself so harshly. remember if you begin to space dont worry. YOU are in control.<br>  2) if you are in college, talk to the psych center. they can sometimes be a great help.<br>  3) DRINK CAFFEINE-FREE TEA .. <br>  4) practice telling yourself that its ok.. its all okay<br>  5) make sure you are moving forward in a positive direction, towards your goals.|`|dd929150cf21ba49ef2c4c26e077033daa	check out www.cchr.org then get a copy of Modern Science of Mental Health then you'll get on top of it - www.dianetics.org|`|7YuZOErRaa	not rly...my anxiety attacks usually are about a specific thing..not randomness.

kB4EJUKgaa	Are they hurting because they are coming in or the teeth are already in and hurting? With wisdom teeth, you may not have enough room for them to come in completely. They can become impacted and that is not pretty. They can also just come in half way and then the gums on top of the half that has not come in can become really irritated or infected. Wisdom teeth are also really hard to clean since your toothbrush usually can't maneuver to the back of them. Therefore, more susceptible to cavities. I'd suggest going to the dentist and having them take a look and see what's going on. Until then, get some OralGel! Hope you feel better!|`|IhFWgO5Naa	There are several possibilities for the pain:<br>  1. your wisdom teeth are erupting. <br>  2. you have cavities on these teeth.<br>  3. these teeth are impacted and wanted to force their way out.<br>  4. you have pericoronitis.Pericoronitis is a common problem in young adults with partial tooth impactions. It usually occurs within 17 to 24 years of age as it is when the third molars start erupting. It occurs when the tissue around the wisdom tooth has become infected because bacteria have invaded the area. Poor oral hygiene and mechanical trauma on nearby tissue can cause this...

Not only are tumours not contagious (they're not 'catchy') but your parents and the vet would not let your cat stay at home if there was the slightest risk that she could infect you. Do speak to your family about your worries though instead of worrying in silence. They will be able to better explain exactly what is going on with your cat.

Answers has your medical history, is for you not to take chances at all with nuts.<br>  <br>  There should be a wealth of treatments that you can ask your allergy specialist about. Some involve desensitizing you towards the effect of nuts through a long therapy process that teaches your body that nuts aren't poisonous. You should really ask a doctor about these things.<br>  <br>  You won't regret paying money for a little advice that can save your life.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	The thing with allergies is that they can be MUCH worse at ANY time.  Once you know you are allergic to something, especially if you have ANY kind of respiratory response, you should STAY AWAY from that food, and you should probably get an epi pen, in case you are accidentally exposed (at a restaurant, for instance).<br>  <br>  It is possible for it to not get any worse, and maybe even to be less severe, but it is not worth the risk.

By eating only once a day it makes your body absorb everything from that one meal. The best way to eat is to have a big breakfast, lunch and a moderate dinner and try not to eat at least 2 hours before you go to bed.|`|f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	the one meal a day thing? thats the WORST thing to do. take it from a diabetic ...eat a few calories every 2-3 hrs and have only complex carbs during the day and only protein at night -and never after 8pm  -increase your daytime activity level, and make sure your tired,... you will sleep. you will lose weight.|`|dSRTkObRaa	ha ha it doesn't matter what time you go to bed to lose weight<br>  it matters how much calories you are eating<br>  you should find out how many calories you are supposed to have a day<br>  also i suggest you use correct portions<br>  eat 3 meals a day, trust me eating one meal is going to nothing but make your body unhealthy|`|4wQffufZaa	well i only eat one meal a day<br>  [trust me.. dont do it, its super bad]<br>  so i guess im unhealthy<br>  :/ :[|`|IPZTO7Fkaa	no, but it does help. the later you stay up the more you will probably snack. if you get a good nights rest you will have more energy the following day to burn.|`|xItxOqE4aa	No, but sleeping is the best thing for your body...You can eat more then 3 meal a day and still lose weight if you do 30 minute of cardio and resistance.|`|il7bLkSIaa	you need to eat at least 4 meals a day and snack in between.

So don't feel embarrassed bc believe me doctors have seen it all.|`|fJiXR9fDaa	theres a simple reasonable answer to your scenario<br>  1) look for some baking soda and yeast<br>  2) get 3 teaspoons of vinegar and an egg whisker<br>  also a mixing bowl<br>  3) whisk for one minute, longer if desired( depending on pain)<br>  4) refridgerate for 24 hr (this will create an aloe)<br>  5) u will need a turkey baster and fill it with 4 teaspoons of mixture<br>  6) apply to affected area and let simmer<br>  <br>  within 72 hrs you will see vaginal healing|`|yaNCjfgHaa	With water, sunshine, and a little love it will grow, but with miracle grow it will blossom!|`|kDxZB4F4aa	ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

9bu2ddK0aa	You need to make sure it's in an ophthalmic base. It MAY help the iritis, as it's an infection, but I wouldn't expect it to help lower your pressure. If you want to reduce the amount (or possibly eliminate) the eye drops you use, consider an SLT laser. Our doctor performs them in our office, and including the time to dilate, it takes about an hour. Insurance will cover the procedure. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maculacenter.com/Procedures/SLT.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maculacenter.com/Procedures/S...</a>|`|47PsTalnaa	It could if the iritis is caused by an infection, but with the glaucoma eye drops I'd talk to the eye doctor before using them.|`|JTJ3Xza3aa	Using colloidal silver will give you that hot Smurfette look that many skinny nerdy geeks with glasses find attractive.|`|tCWO2s5daa	Yes! If it is a good form of Colloidal Silver. It can be manufactured differently, and not all forms are good.

I order and use the silver sold by both sites and both are good.<br>  <br>  For reversing and stopping future glaucoma problems you need to address the issue nutritionally.

Za3iJC3paa	technically HIV can be spread through sweat in the pores...so technically yes the bled on boy could contract HIV from this occurence. I would definately practice safe sex/abstinence, get tested 3 months later and then every 6 months for two years after. Its a tricky and nasty virus! <br>  I hope this is just hypothetical. If not, good luck!|`|gSo4dR7oaa	No. Infected blood would have to get into your blood stream for you to be infected.  Blood on unbroken skin won't infect you.|`|b7fRwEmjaa	no. the blood has to get into the other person's blood for the disease to be transmitted.|`|DtGFWUP5aa	Very unlikely. But I would get tested, I guess.|`|3usRDmQhaa	not as long is it didn't go through the others nose, mouth or eyes|`|AnHQbZQAaa	you need blood to blood contact. blood to skin isn't enough.|`|HPO87jGiaa	No he cannot unless it made contact with some type of bodily fluid(i.e. he rubs the blood in his eye or on an open cut/wound)|`|mh17M1B1aa	If he has no cuts on him then no, interesting question though.|`|lSGhyEneaa	If it got in his mouth yes...<br>  <br>  But if the person has no wounds and it didn't get in his mouth then no|`|ICel15qYaa	yes if there is any opening where the blood can get in like fingernails, etc|`|5FL46nZtaa	only if it got in his mouth or in a cut<br>  so if he had no cuts then probably not

ynS9RQFTaa	I think that it's the patient's choice whether or not it is the proper way to treat them.<br>  Some people just want it to end, the pain and the suffering and they do not want to live so why should they have to?|`|zahy4Brqaa	I don't look at at as "Mercy Killing". I look at the modern medical intervention as "Mercy Living". I think the natural course of events is that all living creatures must die. Sometimes we allow human medical intervention to prolong someone's life for one reason or another but if you allow "nature" to take its path, then I think we all reserve the right whether to accept this intervention or refuse it.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	IF that is the PATIENT'S CHOICE then yes, it should be allowed.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should anyone else make that choice FOR a patient!!!!!|`|m4KFa7yiaa	i guess if they ask for it<br>  think about it<br>  is it really worth living though pain when your going to die in the end?<br>  some say its not right and that death isnt up to us to decide but to me its just preventing alot of pain|`|LYnK4xb0aa	yes|`|vHcoVeS4aa	yes. if its their choice, we should respect that.

Don't click it.<br>  <br>  As for your question, I really don't know. If the results you get here don't work, seeing a doctor would be your best bet. Ask your parents to take you to one. This isn't something you should keep to yourself.<br>  On Wikipedia it said that medication can be prescribed to help with its side effects such as sleep issues, so again, go see a doctor.|`|uC75y83Taa	Olivia, instead of wasting your time and money on going to lots of different doctors who can't help you, go right to the top: see a psychiatrist.<br>  There's an old stigma that psychiatrists are for crazy people, but that is so outdated!  They are the smartest doctors. They go to school an extra 4 years, and they know how to put the pieces of the puzzle together.<br>  You definitely have insomnia, and I promise you that a psychiatrist will help you with that and your RLS.  I've seen them work miracles many times over.<br>  Bless you, Sweetie, and good luck soon!|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I have been suffering from insomnia from the time I was 16.  I'm exactly like you, I can't stop thinking.  By R.L.S. I imagine you're referring to restless leg syndrome.  It can really be annoying but moving your legs in certain ways(you can check R.L.S. on Yahoo! Search or other search place) it really helps that problem..  As for the insomnia, there wasn't much to do when I was young until lately but there seems more and more research are done and I've seen something interesting on the Internet(Yan Sleep),it's not for everybody, like if you have epilepsy.  However, I'm asking for more information and buy it for myself.  It takes a few weeks to come and might take a few weeks to work so if you want to know if it worked for me, I accept e-mails and we can keep in touch.  There's also another product that just came out, it's a blue light that helps you fall asleep so if the first one doesn't work, I will try the other.  Don't feel alone, there are millions of people like you and me.|`|MmBuqilCaa	I grew up the same way. No its not normal. I waited years for some help but never found any. Now a days they have meds that can help but they ant cheap. I am poor and there is no help for the poor on this type of problem. If you can go to a doctor and get help go. It is a problem that is hard to live with.

However, my friend tried my acne medication, and she broke out SOOO BAD.  You may have to do some experimenting on which brand works best for you.<br>  <br>                      The best times to put on the medication are in the morning AND at night. <br>   <br>                       Get rid of the soap!!   Use the wipes! They are SOOO easy to use!! All you have to do is get them wet and then rub on your face!! Make sure to rub harder in the places where you are most broken out, but DO NOT rub too hard or it will tear and stretch out your skin. SERIOUSLY!! <br>  <br>                         Right after you wash, rinse out the wipe so that theres no soap left in it. Then, wash your face with it so that you get the soap off your face. (This is important because if you leave soap on your face, it will dry out your skin.) Next, take a DRY towel and dab your face. DAB!! DO NOT RUB!!!!!! <br>  <br>                          Is your cream medication made for WASHING?? or is it just MEDICATION?!?!?!  If it is for washing, then you can use that too, with a tiny towel A.K.A. washcloth!!! If you do this, do not put a lot on the towel!! Just put it on, and then place under water. Wash, and then rinse, and then dry!!<br>  <br>                        Its a REALLY good idea to get acne MEDICATION to put on your face after drying. Just put a TINY bit on the places that REALLY need it. IT WORKS REALLY GOOD. Only do this once a day, though, preferably at night!!!!<br>  <br>  so yeah!!! OHHHH!!!!! omg ok if the acne is not even on your face, then do it anywhere else!!!<br>  <br>  :D   wowwwwww....i wrote A LOT!! haha sorry if i sounded crazy :P|`|KtN0jAGYaa	You don't have to use all that stuff, all you need is a bar of Ivory Soap. everytime you wash your face, use it, and at night , when you go to bed, and if you have a pimple, put a little Leather on it and leave it on over night , and see if that don't clean your Complexion, so good, I have used it for years, and even  dark spots, on the face come off.everyone admires my nice clean clear skin, and ask me, You must tell me what kind of expensive creams you use for your face?|`|Pg3M8EvNaa	If you're using a cleansing cream, you don't need to be using a separate soap as well. Wash your face with the cleanser and warm water, then pat dry. If you have a prescription or OTC medication cream, spot treat with that after washing your face.|`|6cmaldxpaa	aply to face. Night is the best time. Right before you go to bed and when you wake up.
ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first - main anxiety post] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|zAhwN8ueaa	i also have panic attacks like that.<br>  find stuff that makes you comfortable to bring with you to places.<br>  personally i bring my inhaler, water and pills like antidiarreha, and anti nausea. <br>  and you can breathe while getting braces on. dont worry about it really.<br>  there hands arent fully constantly in your mouth.<br>  if you are quite anxious about it tell them before hand so if you feel anxious they will take their hands out.<br>  good luck! :)|`|Hgvq4QAnaa	I know what its like having anxiety.Though I never had a panic attack.You got to stop thinking about what people are going think about you.Chances are people arnt thinking of you.As for the breating do it slow from your stomach.

Like anal sex or something like that and start rubbing your clit, if your fingers don't do it for you, you need to find something that vibrates.  Examples:  a Venus Vibrance Razor; a massager, they have small handheld massagers at wal-mart, try anything that vibrates.  <br>  <br>  If you don't like clit action maybe you need to save up some money and buy yourself a dildo!!!!|`|bf4ef2e93dd95582b7695020c1e918b7aa	Do what all of my girlfriends did; find a spot that feels nice [the clit for them all] and rub it till everything explodes.

d417c85122d2d50170ee342eddba80b2aa	OK, first you need to find a comfortable position, laying down is best, and then insert a finger into your vagina. Turn your hand palm up or facing the roof and feel for a small bumpy spot, it should feel kind of like a walnut shell.Move your finger over that spot like your telling someone to "come here".

CqLfMpqqaa	Lyme disease can cause MS, or MS can be misdiagnosed as lyme disease.  Many common doctors do not know about lyme disease and the terrible symptoms that they give people.  I had a SPECT scan and it showed decreased blood flow, that was caused by lyme.   I was sick for three years before someone found out what was wrong with me.  You should probaly go to a lyme specialist, and then he/she will refer you to a lyme doctor. It all depends where you live.  Good luck, and feel better soon.!|`|CqPpzOCeaa	Lesions visible on a brain MRI are not uncommon nor are they proof  of disease activity.  Old age can cause them, trauma to the brain like a concussion, Lyme, MS, etc.  Have you heard a doctor talk about Lyme induced MS?  For me, the MS disease-modifying injections made my symptoms worse because they suppressed my immune system.  That was before I was diagnosed with Lyme.

yDJiiqcsaa	The trend is changing - shaving is out and natural is in.|`|m9SAgrB2aa	Well I personally shave, I take like 45 minutes in the shower but I just do it really carefull and prop my legs up in weird positions haha.

I want you to understand the severity of this and talk to your mom or dad or whomever you live with & have them take you to ER immediately to confirm there is no fracture.<br>  <br>  If there is no fracture, a chiropractor would be your best bet long-term (your MD may refer you after prescribing pain medication).<br>  <br>  Honestly, your symptoms sound pretty severe, and the longer you wait, the worse it could get.  I don't want to scare you, but don't underestimate...
S5dtWq8jaa	It's not safe.  Granted women frequently have delayed periods, one should never assume that the woman is not fertile because her period was supposed to be there.  I don't know how your condom can pop, but if this happens again and you don't want to be a dad, change your condom immediately.|`|FReGm4i7aa	Uhh.. if she's not pregnant, but she's delayed that means she was still ovulating-which means it's like a 50% chance of pregnancy i think..not exactly sure, but it's a high percentage. It's never good to have unprotected sex.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Okay, even if she took a test that said "not pregnant" and she's a few days late... those tests can't pick up a pregnancy for like two-three weeks, so she MIGHT be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Whether or not she's pregnant, ALWAYS use condoms. Sperm can live in the cervix for 5 to 6 days and still get her pregnant. Not to mention condoms slow the spread of STDs.<br>  <br>  If you don't want STDs and you don't want pregnancy, you should NEVER have unprotected sex. This should be a no-brainer. Why did you even have to ask?|`|8Rji1bvdaa	if you dont want to be a dad, refrain from sex<br>  yes she could be pregnant, a girl is fertile at all times, even during her period, the myth that you cant fall at that time isnt true.....|`|gMsR5oWDaa	well i you don't want to have the chance of being a dad stop having sex!! i mean thats the only for sure way!!|`|arsAqGf7aa	No, it's stupid.
iK3YYRaTaa	Precious , your search is over. I would limit fruits to 1 a day. Tomato's , all I can eat. Virgin Mary: Tomato juice , hot sauce, celery salt , Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, WOW! Your in heaven!<br>  Now down to business. A low glycemic diet is the key for a diabetic. In fact if all people ate like thgis diabetes would be on the decline instead of on the increase. Here is the web site for 2,480 food listed . With their Index and load. Load is the most Important.. No Carb counting. Watch portions and the load and you will control blood sugars. Wish you would have mentioned if he was type 1 or 2. <br>  <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm</a><br>  <br>  The glycemic index (GI) is a numerical system of measuring how much of a rise in circulating blood sugar a carbohydrate triggers–the higher the number, the greater the blood sugar response. So a low GI food will cause a small rise, while a high GI food will trigger a dramatic spike. A list of carbohydrates with their glycemic values is shown below. A GI is 70 or more is high, a GI of 56 to 69 inclusive is medium, and a GI of 55 or less is low.<br>  <br>  <br>  The glycemic load (GL) is a relatively new way to assess the impact of carbohydrate consumption that takes the glycemic index into account, but gives a fuller picture than does glycemic index alone. A GI value tells you only how rapidly a particular carbohydrate turns into sugar. It doesn't tell you how much of that carbohydrate is in a serving of a particular food. You need to know both things to understand a food's effect on blood sugar. That is where glycemic load comes in. The carbohydrate in watermelon, for example, has a high GI. But there isn't a lot of it, so watermelon's glycemic load is relatively low. A GL of 20 or more is high, a GL of 11 to 19 inclusive is medium, and a GL of 10 or less is low.<br>  <br>  <br>  Foods that have a low GL almost always have a low GI. Foods with an intermediate or high GL range from very low to very high GI.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both GI and GL are listed here. The GI is of foods based on the glucose index–where glucose is set to equal 100. The other is the glycemic load, which is the glycemic index divided by 100 multiplied by its available carbohydrate content (i.e. carbohydrates minus fiber) in grams. (The "Serve size (g)" column is the serving size in grams for calculating the glycemic load; for simplicity of presentation I have left out an intermediate column that shows the available carbohydrates in the stated serving sizes.) Take, watermelon as an example of calculating glycemic load. Its glycemic index is pretty high, about 72. According to the calculations by the people at the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, in a serving of 120 grams it has 6 grams of available carbohydrate per serving, so its glycemic load is pretty low, 72/100*6=4.32, rounded to 4.<br>  Almost everyone would have said watermelon is bad for a diabetic.<br>  <br>  Use ? to ? teaspoon of cinnamon per day. Add it to your coffee, oatmeal, smoothie, or wherever you find it palatable.  <br>  If you already suffer from diabetes, be sure to stay on a regular schedule with your cinnamon usage so that your blood sugar levels don't yo-yo.Use the same amount at the same time every day so that you can get a sense of how cinnamon affects your own personal blood sugar readings. <br>  Use the powdered spice or a cinnamon stick.  Cinnamon pills are also available, and can be found easily via an online search. MHCP is water soluble and is not found in cinnamon oil. <br>  <br>  Lime and lemon juice delay the digestion of starches as does vinegar. I've found that 2-3 tablespoons of lime or lemon juice reduces my post prandial BG response by 10-20 points. Rick Mendosa's site has a lot of material on acids in the diet. Take a look at <a href="http://www.mendosa.com/acidic_foods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mendosa.com/acidic_foods.htm</a> .<br>  <br>  I just threw the last two in for Kicks. Try them they work for some of use. <br>  Good luck to you and BF>>|`|CQww1c2daa	He can eat turkey and chicken.

That's slightly like the same situation with someone with an inner or outer belly button. Maybe it will come out eventually. You can ask your doctor but he/she will probably just say it's healthy and it's alright. Honestly I don't think there's anything *you can do about that, unfortunately. If push comes to shove, surgical procedures can alter that though...if it's really that necessary/serious to you.
hapZbqwuaa	What I am about to tell you Is probably nothing new but rather relevant to your question. It has to be a combination of diet and exercise. Actually 70% nutrition and 30% exercise. Losing weight is a simple process - burn more calories than you consume. <br>  <br>  Some people make the mistake of starving themselves and exercising hard. Food is energy and without that you'll have no energy to exercise. What's required is a balanced diet and moderate exercise.The secret is to reduce food portions, eat whatever you want as long as its nutritious. Don't deny yourself the food you love, just eat less of it. Moderation is the magic key.<br>  <br>  As far as exercise is concerned, the best for burning fat and, more importantly, keeping it off, is interval training. This is short bursts of intense activity. An example would be to walk a few minutes, then run, then walk, without rest in between.Some exercises to use are the superman press ups. Also the plank and side planks. twists is another one. You can incorporate all of them into an exercise program.<br>  Remember to not work the same body part two days in a row. With interval training you burn fat and grow muscle at rest. I usually exercise every second day which works out to 3-4 days a week.<br>  <br>  You can find videos of these exercises as well as others on you tube, especially from Craig Ballantyne. And remember to consult your doctor before starting any program, especially if its your first time.<br>  Always keep in mind 70% diet and 30% exercise. Hope this helps you. If you require anymore info visit my blog, thanks.|`|5bSUm5Xbaa	Yoga which I love, helped, especially plank pose and bandha . However it is true they say you cannot achieve that with crunched or sit ups. Cardio, such a running is one of the best ways.

Exercise is the best thing for you right now. Play a sport for half an hour a day and that will help. I don't really think you need to lose much because you are still growing and you are pretty close to average weight for your height. Maybe just lifting some weights and toning up a little is what you are really looking for. Nothing wrong with being a little beefy if its muscle right?!?|`|fwpu4jL3aa	Experts recommend that you accumulate one hour of physical activity every day to stay healthy or improve our health. Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.<br>  <br>  The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise. As you progress into activity with moderate intensity, you can cut down to 30 minutes a day for four days per week.<br>  <br>  There are 3 types of exercise that your body needs to keep healthy - cardiovascular, flexibility and strength. Cardiovascular activities are those ranging from moderate to vigorous exercises.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the light, moderate and vigorous activities:<br>  <a href="http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008/08/31/lose-weight-by-creating-your-own-exercise-program/" rel="nofollow">http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...</a>

LWmo7lOpaa	What you are prescribed for postoperative pain depends completely on the doctor. You may get anything from prescription-strength ibuprofen (600mg or 800mg tablets), weak opioids (codeine, propoxyphene), medium-strength opioid (hydrocodone), or stronger opioids (oxycodone, hydromorphone, morphine).<br>  <br>  You will most likely get one of the following:<br>  * Tylenol with codeine<br>  * Vicodin, Lortab, Lorcet, or Norco (hydrocodone with acetaminophen (Tylenol))<br>  * Percocet (oxycodone with acetaminophen (Tylenol))<br>  * Percodan (oxycodone with aspirin)<br>  * Combunox (oxycodone with ibuprofen)<br>  <br>  Those are the most commonly prescribed medications for acute postoperative pain.<br>  <br>  The pain should not be severe as it is not a major surgery. Pain medications with hydrocodone or oxycodone will most likely work just fine. Codeine is weaker and may not work as well. But everyone's body and their response to pain is different, so what works great for one person may not work at all for someone else. <br>  <br>  I would take whatever you are given, and if it is not working, or if you are experiencing bad side effects like nausea, vomiting, itching, dizziness, or severe drowsiness, call the surgeon and let him or her know, and you should be switched to something else that may work better for you -- both in how effectiveness in treating your pain and minimizing side effects. There is no reason why you should suffer from undertreated pain or unmanageable side effects from the drugs, so do not be afraid to call the surgeon to adjust or change your medication.|`|umhjqZwLaa	i was exactly 23 when i had my hernia . i got lorcet10s.the only pain you should have is after you start healing. it will itch and burn for several days.i was back to work within 5 days.

What you are experiencing is not normal, but there are some very easy things you can do to help.  <br>  <br>  Most likely you have some inflammation of your prostate gland causing this; it's called prostatitis.  When you ejaculate, fluid is discharged into the urethra (your urinary canal) from your prostate gland and ejaculatory ducts.  Since the prostate is contiguous with the neck of the bladder, a swollen prostate will keep your bladder neck open long enough that urine leaks easily.  <br>  <br>  There are two simple things you can try:<br>  1) Be sure to urinate completely before sex.<br>  2) Don't overstimulate your penis right after sex (it can stimulate your prostate even more and exaccerbate the problem).  <br>  <br>  If those things don't solve the problem, make an appointment to see a urologist.  They would be able to give you a clear diagnosis.  If it is prostatitis, sometimes medication is required to treat it.|`|AA10281378	I forgot why, but either way you should do it.

fZ3FXZMyaa	I've done some extensive soul searching research on this question: How does one become a pirate?  You don't need much.  1. do not shower for one month. 2. You'll need a parachute with no cord.  3.  Get someone to punch out your teeth and brush your gums with feces.  Get the idea in your head everyday say "Damn I'm one scurvy looking pirate and smile in the mirror.  One eye patch is required:  due to the instructions I must give you.  3. Find a buzzard and put your face up to it or just play dead on the ground for about 3 hours in the hot sun.  Like I said for the real effect you'll need the eye patch.  4. You will need a one-way ticket to the Bermuda Triangle. Priceline.com should be able to book you with no problem. When you see the Aurora Boriealis that will be where the parachutte comes in to play.  Now WARNING... you must catch the right ghostship.  You don't want the one that takes you to reruns of Gilgan's Island, Besides they really only have banana cream pies.  The ships name should say the SSS punyata jump when you see that one and you will find all de gold da bloons you could ever wish for.  Your problem is solved.  See ya in the history books!|`|cnnSAkQJaa	Wise decision. Pirates have a lot of loot. <br>  First and foremost you will need a boat. A boat of any kind will do but I recommend a paddle boat. They're great exercise and theres no engine maintenance to worry about. Next you will need a fluffy shirt, a talking parrot, a cool nickname(such as Captain Morgan or Barnacle Billiam), a loyal crew to help you loot the booty, and most important you will need a fake accent. This accent can easily be acquired by saying "RRR" at the end of all your sentences. And if you really want to be convincing use the phrase "shiver me timbers" more than you usually would. Now go find you a treasure map and hit them waters ye skud bucket! Yo Ho Ho......and a bottle of RUM!|`|JJNofYTFaa	it sounds like you're already a butt pirate|`|689bdcac7ef55f01be173522554cba2caa	Download limewire.<br>  <br>  ;)|`|g5JqqtrIaa	They just ARRREEE!!!!
D100ixUgaa	Pushups are great, and you should keep doing them; strength exercises build muscle, and muscles burn calories. But building muscle takes time. In the meantime, to burn calories, you should be doing cardiovascular exercise for at least half an hour, at least three days a week (5 or 6 days a week is better). Cardio is basically anything that gets your heart pumping and keeps it pumping. Running is great, but so is dancing, swimming, hiking, and fast-moving sports like tennis and basketball. And long walks are also good. It can be hard to motivate yourself to exercise on your own, so your best bet is probably to join some sports teams, take up martial arts, befriend the kids at the basketball court, and generally try to have as many "active" hobbies as possible. Play hard. Having an active lifestyle is really the key to losing weight. Then, just watch what you eat. Don't stress about it, just lay off the candy, soda, fast food, and junk. Eat that stuff once a week at most. Eat healthy snacks throughout the day, like fruit and carrot sticks, and don't eat huge meals. Also, don't eat for 3 or 4 hours before you go to bed. And drink AT LEAST 8 glasses of water a day; a gallon a day is better (but more than a gallon can be bad for you). Water should be your main drink; juice and milk are high in calories, so drink them in moderation. If you eat right and move your body, you should have no problem losing weight at your age. Being short has nothing to do with it. Good luck!|`|J7TKG7Hfaa	Whatever you do, don't eat

Magnesium: Magnesium is necessary to keep your metabolism functioning properly. If you are not getting enough magnesium in your diet, your metabolism may slow down. (When you buy vitamin supplements, never take more than the recommended dose, however!)<br>  <br>  2. Vitamin B is another vitamin that is essential for boosting your metabolism. B-12 in particular is known to give an energy boost and increase your metabolic rate. <br>  <br>  3. Spicy foods. Studies show that eating foods containing ingredients like black pepper, ginger, and chili peppers can boost your metabolism by as much as 8 percent for several hours after you eat them!<br>  <br>  4. Green Tea not only boosts your metabolism, studies show that it has health benefits including acting as an anti-oxidant and protecting against heart disease. <br>  <br>  5. Water. Dehydration causes your metabolism to slow down. Even mild dehydration can cause your metabolism to slow down as much as three percent, in much the same way that cutting back on calories does. When your body is deprived of water it slows down all of its metabolic functions. Drinking water not only fills you up, it keeps your metabolism functioning efficiently.|`|miCJLOHYaa	Babylon has it right, there is no specific food proven to increase metabolism.. The only way you can increase it is by exercising and eating the smaller portions more frequently will keep your metabolism from crashing. I'm sure you've heard it before, but if you eat less your body understands that food should be conserved now, so it will hold on to whatever you put in your gullet. And this is also why diets don't work. Exercise is a big key to increasing metabolism. That doesn't mean you have to become a gym rat though. 30 minutes a day is good aim :)|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>  <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>  <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>  <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>  <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis!  <br>  <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>  <br>  My friend tried hypnosis to lose weight.  Initially, her weight was 198lbs and she lost 18.3lbs within 3-weeks!  All by natural metabolism!  And she never even change her diet but ate as normal!<br>  <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!

9pLdhuBnaa	I had two pins in my toe when I had surgery on my right big toe and Achilles tendon 8 months ago.  When the doctor took the pins out I held my breath and the first pin that came out did not hurt.

AA11432707	Oral surgeons don't give paralytics, so if you're awake, you'll move.  I'm not exactly sure WHAT they give - they have much less training than anesthesiologists do, and they do not adhere to the same standards of safety that we do - I do know that.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that you'll get midazolam and propofol.  There is a chance you'll drift in and out during the procedure, but the midazolam will eep you from remembering anything.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	i've had 6 surgeries and i've never had anesthesia awareness. you need to realize that it is a VERY VERY RARE occurrence. <br>  <br>  not that i'm saying it will happen (cuz it won't) but even if it did after they put you to sleep they then use local anesthesia (Novocaine) to numb your mouth so that when you wake up after the surgery is over you aren't hit will bad pain. so even if you did wake up during surgery you wouldn't be in pain. <br>  and the anesthesia they use at the dentist only puts y0ou in a light sleep (not so deep that you couldn't communicate) if you did wake up you would actually wake up and they would give you more anesthesia. (but you won't wake up)<br>  <br>  i had my wisdom teeth removed about 5 years ago and i didn't wake up during it. i was grateful that they used Novocaine though cuz i had no pain when i left. but be sure to go home and take a pain killer (that they give you) and then take a long nap cuz once the Novocaine wears off its gonna hurt<br>  <br>  good luck and stop worrying :)|`|AA10774810	Ok, did you see Awake?

I don't know anyone who has.  And I haven't even heard of stories of people who have.  <br>  <br>  Think about the thousands of other things that you do on a daily basis that involve risk.

ubukt8WWaa	It's unusual to skip months.  It's extremely unusual to always have it exactly on the 6th.  Months have different numbers of days in them.  Always landing on the 6th would be quite a coincidence!<br>  <br>  It sounds like maybe you've only had a few periods?  If you're just starting, then it's very normal to skip months and have an irregular schedule.
zSkC7hsGaa	Looks like you are eating to many veggies, you plate should be full of meat cheeses and eggs. a small salad of allowed veggies on the side.eat nothing that is not on the list.<br>   When i was on it I used to eat a half baked chicken for dinner no veggies.<br>   Breakfast would be 10 egg whites,bacon or sausage(turkey sausage)or a small breakfast steak. add cheese to the eggs <br>   The induction phase is very hard but it does work, don't forget you are allowed seasonings.<br>   If you put only protein on you plate you should see a quick drop in weight, its mostly water but you will feel more energetic as you move on to the next phase.<br>   I works, I've done it many times getting ready for bodybuilding competitions.<br>   Since you don't really have a lunch time, carry string cheese, or cubes,boiled eggs, or a atkins bar you can eat on the run. Never be without a protein snack in your bag just in case of emergency.|`|TcaWW4OBaa	what are you doing wrong? youre being impatient. its youre first week, the weight isnt just going to fall off straight away. thats good for the first week. keep it up and youll keep losing, and you will lose more. and ofcourse exercise a little.|`|5bSUm5Xbaa	Well I do not think diets work. You probably do not want to hear it but... Just eat better with smaller portions and exercise. Not all diets work for all people. Perhaps it's just not the appropriate approach to weight loss for you. Plus some people gain muscle faster with protein diets and others just gain weight, especially since that diet is not balanced. Also if you do this long term please be careful with you rectal health, and with your health in general.|`|2IucHxm0aa	That sounds like more than 20 carbs. The Induction is limited to only 20 carbs. - Hope you find your solution.

Maybe if you prioritize things in order of importance.  You need to eliminate clutter in your life that inhibits reaching your goals.  Try to keep your mind on what you are doing at that particular time.  Don't let your mind wander or it can get you in deep doo doo.  Try to eat a healthy diet to help keep everything functioning properly.  If you end up developing an ulcer - then something's gotta go.  You can't ruin your health over it - it's not worth it.|`|dd83ec34a7001b938f4187223bc6e654aa	The only thing you can do is try to make yourself focus on what you're doing at the time when you catch yourself wandering.

UmdNDMRkaa	The gynecologist can't tell whether or not you've been having sex. There is no such thing as physical proof of virginity--the only way her gyno could tell would be if you two had sex immediately beforehand and there was still semen in her vagina.<br>  <br>  Even if the gynecologist could tell, she's not legally allowed to tell your girlfriend's mother without your girlfriend OKing it first.|`|Mh1cNOHsaa	Nope. If they're checking to see if she's a virgin and she isn't, there's no way to hide it. If a girl is a virgin, her hymen (a paper-thin bit of skin covering her vaginal hole) will be intact. When a girl has sex for the first time, the hymen is broken, indicating that she is no longer a virgin. So, no, if a girl has ever had sex, EVER, a gynecologist will know. Depending on how old she is, though, she can request that the gynecologist doesn't tell her mother. Doctor-patient confidentiality prohibits a doctor from telling anyone, even the parents, about a patient's exam, provided she's of a certain age. The age here in Arizona is 15, I believe. When/IF her mother takes her in, have your girlfriend ask the doctor about the doctor-patient confidentiality. If she's not old enough, then I guess you're in deep s**t.|`|rlPaSjx8aa	They can assume that if the hymen is ripped she has had sex. Though, it ripping can also be explained by a lot of different things not just sex so there isn't any way to tell 100%.|`|ceec066b682a10d9794421a040a090dbaa	Of course they can.  Science can even estimate when you last had sex if you recently had it.|`|LrGmpacOaa	Her mother cannot do that. Even as a minor, she has the legal right to medical privacy.<br>  <br>  And besides that, there is no way to tell if she is having sex. The hymen can be broken by things like playing sports and using tampons, not just sex. So there is no way for someone to just look at her vagina and see if she's a virgin or not.

AA10400267	I'd get a second opinion.  Every doctor I know wants to monitor your BP for a while before prescribing meds.  Even if there's a history of high BP in your family, yours should still be monitored before he/she prescribes meds for it.  To answer your other questions, no it's not way high, but it is outside the realm of "normal".  At this borderline stage, it is highly likely that you can control your BP through diet, exercise and lifestyle changes.  I'd find another doctor and let him/her help me devise a plan to control my BP without meds.  Good luck!|`|AA10789310	In my experience (13 years medical transcription), I have noticed that most doctors will monitor a patient's blood pressure for several visits before prescribing new medication, especially if there is no history of it being high before.  It seems that they usually have the patient come in for a few blood pressure checks in the office before they start medication.  Your pressure doesn't seem way too high to me, but I am not a doctor.  Maybe you should check your blood pressure at home or in one of the pharmacies in your area, and then possibly re-consult your doctor or get a 2nd opinion.|`|c18d2a83377bbadd7b3cadff069642e5aa	buy a blood pressure monitor so that you can monitor your own blood pressures at home.  Try the Rx and if your blood pressures become low <100 systolic (top number), then you should go back to the doctor and talk to him about discontinuing the Rx.  If they stay around a normal BP (120/70) that means they are working and that you should keep taking them.|`|ab0b1cbf8eb16ee3a10467c7c1802a90aa	It doesn't sound too high, the lower pressure should ideally be under 90, but medication straight away at one reading is a bit panicky.

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	Please read the recommendations below. Also, go to the book store and locate the book "Weight Training for Dummies". In chapter 15 you will find excellent information on how to perform abdominal exercises correctly. Page 218 of the book dispels all the myths surrounding abdominal training. <br>  <br>  The following healthy living recommendations will help you if you’re trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:<br>  <br>  *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at <a href="http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/library/weight/calsburned.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...</a><br>  <br>  Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone.

Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:        <br>  Adults: <a href="http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...</a><br>  Teens/Children: <a href="http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/weight/bmi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...</a><br>  <br>  It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. <br>  <br>  *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. <br>  <br>  Avoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety. <br>  <br>  *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is “Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005”. A superb book to read is “You The Owner’s Manual”. An excellent periodic publication is the “Nutrition Action Health Letter”.

Take a good look at your diet and besides getting rid of the obvious fried and fatty foods; get all of the sugar and white flour out of your diet.

Any way It's my own opinion. <br>      The things you have mentioned are all important aspects to good health, but because we are focusing on the older adult safety issues are always the priority.Sense of balance and equilibrium, sense of sight hearing and touch decreases as we age, careful actions and use of safety and assistive devices are encouraged. <br>             Another important area other than wellness practice are health promotion and disease prevention, these includes regular check-up and routine examination, such as digital rectal examination to detect early signs of prostatic cancer for male older adults and pap smear to detect cervical cancer.

d99832e130a64a06093d4aaedf7fe11eaa	Hello Tootsie!<br>  <br>  You can make great sweet tea using Splenda. It has real sugar in it in addition to the substitute. Check it out! You should be very concerned with the low blood sugar of 50. You can faint, go into a coma, have a stroke, etc...If your doctor is not listening to you, change doctors. I am terminally ill and I've had many doctors. Some I fired for less than your doctors matter-of-fact attitude. You are talking about life and death. I found this article from a Prevention on-line Magazine:<br>  <br>  An around-the-clock blood-sugar monitor that works like a smoke detector--beeping loudly if blood sugar plummets or skyrockets--could help kids and adults with diabetes avoid dangerous complications. (And let diabetics, and those who care for them, sleep easier.)<br>  <br>  The Guardian Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, okayed by the FDA in 2004, uses a sensor to sample sugar levels in the liquid contained in the fat layer between muscle and skin. Info is transmitted to a beeper-size, wireless monitor. It tracks changes diabetics can't feel until it's too late: low blood sugar that can cause fainting, even coma, and high blood sugar that can damage kidneys, eyes, and nerves.<br>  <br>  You can read more on the article at the source below. Please take care of this and don't be so non-chalant. It really is serious, honey.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Raylene?|`|40ca950a7bd16b030725630fc056c7caaa	Its probably because your body is still producing the insulin it needs to deal with the sugar in the tea you are drinking.  It takes time for the body to stop producing the insulin once the sugar is used up.  With the added effect of the meds it can compound the problem.  <br>  <br>  You need to discuss this with your doc and/or a diabetic educator and try to do without the tea and see how, over time, your body is able to adjust.  You may not have to take as much, or any, meds, but you will have to continue to monitor your blood sugars regularly.|`|abb64ac43107b16ae89b32001bc051c0aa	Im sorry I don't know much about diabetes, but I do know it's very dangerous to mess around with...you REALLY need to get a new doctor!

Proper nutrition has a lot of benefits that are ignored by our society far too often.  We depend too much on doctors, who don't always have the education to help us with all of our problems.  Most doctors rely on medication for most of their patients' problems, when sometimes the answer is much simpler and much safer.<br>  <br>  I dealt with depression for a long time, and it improved significantly when I learned about nutrition.  My mom worked for a naturopath, so I got tons of health advice from her, and it was great!  You should be able to find a lot of information on how diet is related to a lot of things.  I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, and since I'm not a nutritionist or anything, I won't try to give you all the advice you need, but I think you can definitely find the answer with food.  If not, there are supplements that can help as well.<br>  <br>  I saw that someone recommended 5-htp.  I recommend researching this before using it...  I had a bad experience with it.  I could barely get out of bed when I started taking it.   It's definitely not for everyone.  Actually, if you're going to use tryptophan, I'd advise you to find something that's from a different source.  I heard that it can do weird things to you if it's from the griffonia seed, which is where 5-htp comes from.  check out this web site.

AA11543024	It CAN BE toxic or beneficial, depending on the amount and where in the body it is released. Initial research into the chemistry of nitric oxide (NO) was motivated by its production in car engines, which results in photochemical smog and acid rain. In the late 1980s, researchers in immunology, cardiovascular pharmacology, neurobiology, and toxicology discovered that nitric oxide is a crucial physiological messenger molecule. Nitric oxide is now thought to play a role in blood pressure regulation, control of blood clotting, immune defense, digestion, the senses of sight and smell, and possibly learning and memory. Nitric oxide may also participate in disease processes such as diabetes, stroke, hypertension, impotence, septic shock, and long-term depression. See also Immunology.<br>  <br>  Most cellular messengers are large, unreactive biomolecules that make specific contacts with their targets. In contrast, nitric oxide is a small molecule that contains a free radical—that is, an unpaired electron—making it very reactive. Nitric oxide can freely diffuse through aqueous solutions or membranes, reacting rapidly with metal centers in cellular proteins and with reactive groups in other cellular molecules.<br>  <br>  Nitric oxide is produced in the body by an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase, which converts the amino acid L-arginine to nitric oxide and L-citrulline. There are three types of nitric oxide synthase: brain, endothelial, and inducible. Both brain and endothelial enzymes are constitutive, that is, they are always present in cells, while the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase can be turned on or off when a system needs nitric oxide. After nitric oxide is produced in specific areas of the body by nitric oxide synthase, it diffuses to nearby cells. Nitric oxide then reacts preferentially in the interior of these cells with the metal centers of proteins. Nitric oxide binds specifically to the iron (Fe) atom of the heme group in proteins; it can also interact with other metal sites in proteins as well as with the thiol group (SH) of the amino acid cysteine. The interaction of nitric oxide with these proteins causes a cascade of intracellular events that leads to specific physiological changes within cells. For example, nitric oxide causes the smooth muscle cells surrounding blood vessels to relax, decreasing blood pressure. Nitric oxide plays an important role in the central and peripheral nervous systems; the overproduction of nitric oxide in brain tissues has been implicated in stroke and other neurological problems.<br>  <br>  Nitric oxide also functions as an important agent in the immune system by killing invading bacterial cells. Nitric oxide released by macrophages can inhibit important cellular processes in the bacteria, including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and respiration, by binding to and destroying iron-sulfur centers in key enzymes in these pathways.<br>  <br>  Although nitric oxide production in the immune system serves a crucial biological function, there can be adverse effects when too much nitric oxide is produced. During a massive bacterial infection, excess nitric oxide can go into the vascular system, causing a dramatic decrease in blood pressure, which may lead to possibly fatal septic shock. Thus, scientists are working on drugs that can selectively inhibit the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase in order to avoid the harmful effects produced by excess nitric oxide without interfering with useful nitric oxide pathways.|`|af9ce069d0b640b74b096bb68afd9b1faa	Not that I know of.|`|3231af143d9a5a2a1ac1a67ef6fc62c2aa	Yes.

AA10805888	i've suffered from insomnia my entire life. i've yet to find anything that can get me to sleep regularly but there are some things that making falling asleep a little easier/less stressful.<br>  1. don't use your bed for anything except sleeping and love making. this is a hard one especially on restless nights. if you know you won't be sleeping in the next hour, go elsewhere. i keep a comfortable reading chair in my bedroom for this reason.<br>  2. don't fall asleep anywhere but in your bed. if you feel yourself nodding off on the couch in front of the TV, go to bed. <br>  3. if you're light sensitive, black out your room. this includes digital clocks. its easy as putting a small paper in front of the display. <br>  4. no midnight snacking or drinking. i don't have anything other than water at least an hour before my desired bedtime. <br>  5. this one is toughest for me. go to bed and wake up at the same hour every day even if you don't have to. don't lay in bed more than necessary and start moving around as soon as possible.<br>  6. drink body temperature water as soon as you awaken. this is an amazing trick. it has made an enormous difference in my health as well as my sleeping habits. the water wakes up your body from the inside. why body temperature? this saves your body from feeling a cold shock. you want to wake your system gradually. start with half a glass the first day and gradually work up to a couple glasses everyday. i usually have my first bottle (16 oz) before i get out of bed and drink another one as i get ready for work. it took no more than three days for me to see a change in my habits and my attitude.<br>  <br>  i don't have answers to give you. i can only suggest to you the techniques that have worked so well for me. i'm still considered an insomniac but through experience i have learned to better cope with the problem and live the best i can considering the circumstances.|`|7a76e0494a5ae222104e58b87625c4f2aa	A  hot bath some chamomile tea realxing music and something good to read and no caffiene from 2 o'clock.|`|838c914860144967011e07cf0a1894edaa	Warm milk before you go to sleep helps.|`|83d112280c215255ef331aba38814a2baa	I aways read a book or watch TV.

Pads just aren't cool for swimming.|`|k6bUrwcKaa	I've never heard of way to swim without wearing a tampon, so if you have your period when you need to swim, you either have to wear one, or tell the teacher/coach you can't do it until it is done with.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	if you where a pad it will swell up like a diaper and start coming apart in the water. use a tampon or dont swim.|`|8q82dLS8aa	if you wear a tampon|`|sKTmxnx1aa	I'm in the same situation because my family and I are going to a water park in two weeks, and I'm due to get my period like, the day we leave.

SN97cmOTaa	nope.not wasting time at all if your not even chubby then you will build ab muscle fast and it will show since you got no fat..sounds like an easy goal<br>  <br>  keep your legs raised in the air and it will be more intense bring them knees to your chest when you crunch up<br>  <br>  also put one foot/ankle on top of each other knee for equal amount of reps and you will work outside abs|`|xFeGxPtoaa	Sounds like a good idea. And a smart way to exercise instead of wasting money to go to the gym. <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter the amount of crunches you do. As long as you tire out your muscles. Tiring out your muscles will generate more protein to flow there and ATP levels will raise during resting. And all that biological stuff... =D<br>  <br>  I think the hardest part of doing this would be the consistency. That's why I feel like ruling out consistency is imperative!!<br>  <br>  I mean, fall in love with doing crunches!<br>  <br>  In the winter of 2006 I was a little over weight and I wanted to drop some. So I decided to go jogging. So I jogged every day consistently until my cardio got in shape and so on.<br>  <br>  Than I stopped jogging my normal path around my neighborhood and started going places I hadn't gone before. Jumping over stuff and now I guess I can say my body is pretty defined.<br>  <br>  Diet too. You are what you eat. =P|`|ablriuUVaa	yes u will, nice results at that|`|AVaIc2hKaa	Since you are already slim, it will be easy to see results faster with the work. I recommend you mix it up with different ab exercises, this keeps your muscles confused, in a sense, and prevents a plateau in your workout benefits.<br>  <br>  This site could help: <a href="http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abex...</a><br>  <br>  Bicycle sit-ups (exercise 1) really help the abs as well as the obliques (on either side) giving your muscle tone more balance.<br>  The plank (exercise 10) is AWESOME, it works all over, but stabilizes the abs really well.<br>  <br>  Also, one more that is extremely effective is: <br>  Lie flat on your back, and with the arms outstretched behind you (you can hold on to something, chair, couch, etc. typically this is done w/a partner and you hold onto their ankles), lift the legs upward in a straight line to a 90 degree angle, then bring them back down, hold them straight and slightly bent, but DO NOT TOUCH THE FLOOR, go as close to the floor as you can and then bring them up to a 90 degree again. 50 reps of this should make your abs pretty sore. And most importantly, will do wonders to tone!!<br>  <br>  I promise you'll see results fairly quickly. I do these exercises  (and a few others) and within several weeks developed a six-pack. :) At the very least you'll have nicely toned abs and obliques, which looks great and helps you have good posture!|`|YArHO0Jtaa	It will show results but you will get a much better much beter form by spreading that count accross more mid body exercize. 50 crunches, 50 scizer kicks, 100 side bends (50 each side), 50, squats, and 50 lunges.<br>  Im sure you will be much happier with the results of such a regiment as your abs and all its supporting cast will be more pronounced.|`|G1OSlub8aa	Not at all, crunches are an effective exercise for abs.|`|O9MzZxyzaa	brag much?
0WySBPk9aa	they usually do about 3 injections of novocaine around the tooth that is to be extracted, it will be completely numb, and you wont feel a thing.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	no. they only numb the place where the extraction is going to happen.<br>  they might numb the other side only if you get more work done that requires it.

And just for my luck, it was my right front tooth. I was very scared, I was even to scared to see what my orthodontist had to say. So i just left it alone. Luckily, the weird feeling went away after like 4 weeks. Now, my teeth all feel normal, even after i got them tightened and everything. Hope i helped. :) Bye|`|jwOdHnzoaa	The pain is a normal part of new wires.. If you mean physically loose, then you should call your dentist. But if it just "feels" loose, you are okay. My teeth felt loose when strong wires were put on because they're moving so much that they can actually be a little loose. But a lot loose isn't good.|`|YCqnmsrFaa	Hm. Maybe a bracket's loose? The pain should go away in 3 days but I'd call the dentist and ask him about your tooth.|`|covDawN5aa	You could call your orthodontist but most likely your teeth are adjusting. They are being pushed into different positions so a little wiggle is probably normal. Just call and ask.

Lift your upper body off the floor - just a few inches and relax back down. Repeat 10 times.<br>  <br>  Same starting position as above, but arms extended forward by the side of your head (like if you were swimming). Lift one arm up together with looking forward, then relax back down. Repeat 10 on each side.<br>  <br>  Same starting position as above. Lift one leg backwards off the floor keeping leg straight. Repeat 10 on each side.<br>  <br>  You can combine different arm/ leg lifts or do both together.<br>  Its supposed to be really good for your back and you should feel the effect straight away.<br>  <br>  Hope the above descriptions make sense :o)|`|4a53b8b0efbf52aea881afbe96918ad1aa	swimming uses every muscle in the body|`|c2c0a1f90a23029b6724b90b310707e5aa	Hiya, ia great exercise you can do to work your middle (and lower) back muscles is to do dorsal raises. There really easy and you can do them anywhere, plus you don't need any equipment. <br>  <br>  How to do a dorsal raise:<br>  <br>  Lie on the floor face down with your feet together and cross your hands under your face. Slowly lift your head (and arms) off the ground around 4-6 inches and then hold at the top, before lowering back to the starting position. Build up the number of reps you do, start doing two sets of 8 reps and slowly increase the reps as you improve.<br>  <br>  Another point: when you are working out you need to remember to work the muscles which don't get as much as attention, such as your lower and middle back. Otherwise you'll find you get instability between the muscle groups.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get it sorted out.|`|e454bdb66416d7041c98277d234eaee5aa	That's kinda of cool cause I think i stumbled upon something cool last night, I basically put on music and turn the lights down, make sure all the blinds are closed, and no one can come in and I start working out, like I do karate poses where you tighten all your muscles in your back then your front, kinda like the Bruce lee poses, and you just squeeze them alot till they start to burn, this is how I start, i do this for as long as i feel like it,  then I start doing some kickboxing, boxing punches , push ups, jumping up and down, dancing to the music when I felt like it, and then I do everything over again, and mix everything up, nothing routine just everything like you feel like, basically anything you wouldn't normally do in public, to much infeses is put on doing things right, there is no right way for anything, i suggest you try this, it was a real experience for me and I really got a good sweat out of this, and i feel almost zero stress now, I hope you understand what I'm saying, i know it sounds crazy but I think it will help, please let me know if you have any success or have any questions as I wont to also know if I'm on to something, thanks,|`|AA10301962	Go to a fitness gym and ask them!|`|b753df1e74da6ce9ac98627758f217dfaa	Extreme pain like that sounds like something other than muscle fatigue.

H2E3tLzeaa	Based on your description, your dad most probably underwent a very common surgical procedure called a "cystoscopy."  This procedure allows a doctor to examine the urinary tract for irregularities.  It can be used for a variety of reasons including early detection of cancer, obstructions, bleeding, infections, and other disorders of the urinary tract.<br>  <br>  A piece of surgical equipment called a cystoscope is inserted into the urethra (the tube that lets urine pass from the body) and up into the bladder.  The cystoscope allows the doctor to see and record images of the urinary tract.  Additionally, minor surgical procedures and biopsies (removal of a small amount of tissue for testing) can be performed in conjunction with the cystoscope.  <br>  <br>  If the medication your father is taking has worked, then I would guess that it was probably a simple infection.  These are common within the urinary tract and typically relatively easy to treat with antibiotics and other medications. If you think it might be something more serious, ask your dad about the results of his biopsy.|`|dae20c39eb2cbb21d4b2bbdeb812f7caaa	If i was your dad i would sue the people that did the surgery. because of it now he might have to get his penis took off .

ad2a02ef041d76b2e2f13c6a3604cd89aa	Yes, call your eye doctor specialist and get a quick exam but with your symptoms, I would definitely plan on going to a big institution that specializes in visual problems- like Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, PA.  They have seen it all- and you will get diagnosed quickly, efficiently and treated the same.  It sounds like you are have a major problem and you may need a neurologist also to make sure that there is nothing going on with your optic nerve.<br>  I'll be praying for you--- good luck to you.|`|AA10336063	In the Old Testament story of David and Goliath. Goliath was a giant man who couldn't see too far anead of him. Supposedly he had a pitutitary gland tumor. But, your blood sugar levels can have an effect on eye sight too. Maybe you and your husband are developing type 2 diabetes. Maybe, it's cataracts. You need to have a physycal.  Having a stroke can also leave your vision altered for some time after the stroke.|`|7b0f52c3ef06e4812414d190a8a18c7caa	You bet you can. I'm not sure how old you are, but as we age, that is definitely one of the things that can go.  Again not knowing your age, cataracts and macular degeneration can also affect depth perception. I'd see the eye doctor when you have time.<br>  Also in chinese medicine, the eyes are linked to the liver. If the liver is "cloudy" so are the eyes.

But about 15 percent of women continue to experience severe cramping and heavy bleeding during their periods and end up having the device removed. During the first few weeks after insertion, you have a slightly increased risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection in the uterus or Fallopian tubes. This infection may cause scarring that will make it more difficult to get pregnant later and in rare cases can even be fatal; that's one reason why it's important to return to your doctor or clinic for a follow-up visit soon after insertion. The IUD can also pierce the uterus while it's being put in, causing bleeding and injury, but this is quite uncommon.|`|iiExfNYQaa	go back and insist that the Dr does an exam to see what might be the problem and if this one wont seek a second opinion =after all we pay for their pay checks|`|IEs2yfQfaa	I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN HOW DRS DO NOT SEEM TO CARE NOR LISTEN ,  COULD BE BACTERIAL INFECTION ....

I work for an OBGYN who recommends this pill to everyone who just wants to regulate their period.  For the most part, the doctor recommends that you start the pill the sunday after your period and yes it does take up to 2-3 cycles before your body adjusts to the hormone levels. A few side effects to look for is break through bleeding that is heavier than your normal period, bruising, nausea and headaches.  As your body adjusts to the hormones, these symptoms will go away.  If you are still not comfortable with any of these symptoms and its been 3 months, talk to your doctor about changing the pill to something like Ortho Cyclen or something a bit stronger just until you get your system regulated.  Good Luck.

S5H0NmEWaa	Best not.<br>  If you are struggling in life, drugs are not the answer. They can take your mind off stuff for an evening but they won't solve anything. They'll only contribute to making things worse. <br>  <br>  It probably will make you boring in your friends' eyes, but you have to decide whether it's better to be boring and take a principled stand or just to give in and get yourself into a heap of mess.<br>  <br>  You should probably try to find ways of dealing with your issues -finding somebody you trust to talk through things with, even a counsellor or therapist, would be a start. That's the only way you'll actually improve your life.<br>  <br>  You might also want to consider the potential long-term effects of dope - it can make you more prone to mental health problems, even schizophrenia, and it can raise your risk of testicular cancer. Both nasty. The risk may be low, but the impact, if you're unlucky, is very, very high.<br>  <br>  And don't forget the legal issues, although that depends on where you are.<br>  <br>  Best advice: don't. Or, if you do, be careful, don't make a habit, and keep a bit of perspective on what is really important in your life - and your future.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Don't do it.  There's nothing good that could possibly come from it.|`|PVe6jK78aa	If you have to ask then answer's no. I smoke on occasion and it doesn't have any negative side effects in moderation but you seem unsure and i don't want to ruin your friends time smoking by telling you that you should do it and then you freak out and pee your pants and your friends have to stop you from telling your parents.|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	There are no reason TO do it...it's illegal...period.  I know "it's no big deal" and you will hear plenty of those types of answers on here, but if you are looking for any type of GOOD job, you will be tested for drugs and depending on the type of job, they may take a hair sample...did you know pot stays in your hair for something like 10 years?  If you can't come up with your own reasons to do it, then I would say you don't need to be doing it...the repercussions far outweigh that 5 minute high you're gonna have.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Sorry about the depressing things going on in your life. Pot won't take care of them and escape is never an answer.  You need to get some counseling to deal with the situation.  Drugs are not the way to go.|`|DcUoZntOaa	For the reasons you listed i would say pass on it. No, it won't be in your hair or get you caught when you're older<br>  but it should be a free choice of your own. not to cover up problems.<br>  peace!|`|UPN3zqq6aa	whats the point in that, trust me its so not cool<br>  x|`|vEVtXftTaa	Be forewarned: weed is a depressant, so it is going to slow down all of your body functions as well as your reaction time, much like alcohol.  Though it's uplifting and you will feel "high", which is a little bit weird the first time, it may really catch you off guard.<br>  It will be in your system for about 30 days, but if you don't need to take a drug test, you should be fine.  It will probably make you different, a little dumb, maybe a little boring.  It really depends on your personality.  Sometimes people can be really chatty and fun when they are high, sometimes they can be lethargic and boring.  How you react depends a lot on how comfortable you are with the people you will be with.|`|y05xZzwdaa	Honesty is important here. I have smoked weed before and I used it also to alleviate stress. Truth is with or without it my problems still exist. <br>  What it does for me is it calms me down, everything around me is funny and once my high is wearing off I get extremely hungry. <br>  Find something else to help you with your problems. Instead of spending your time high, spend your time finding a solution to your problems. Think about all the risks. You already have problems, do you want more?|`|2rqNI0Dwaa	Don't do it to "deal with your problems" or whatever.  Then you will just depend on it and probably get addicted.  <br>  It won't make you different dumb, or boring...but it sounds like you are doing it for all the wrong reasons.|`|Wb1ydezNaa	you should never want to be like anyone else and you should never follow negativity,smoking weed is negative in every way shape and form.there is no reason why you should,except stupidity|`|YhYSZlroaa	it just makes you really tired and melow.

Smoking won't make you feel any less depressed. First of all, smoking will make you realize why you are so depressed and might make you share with people those things. You might also become more depressed afterwards because you know that your family will not approve. You already mentioned that you might get caught, so guilt might catch up to you afterwards as well. Pot will not make you boring, but it will make you different. A few people that live with me smoke, and everytime they get high they get super annoying and open about their lives. Plus it smells bad, makes giant dents in your brain, and is bad for your lungs. Don't think that just because it is prescribed to help people with cancer to feel less pain that it is perfectly safe. Most people that smoke it for medical reasons are in severe pain or are dying. So, DON'T SMOKE.|`|4onF5FSTaa	Hi, Hope You Are Ok.<br>  Ok, before trying weed (or any type of drug), you NEED to look at this website to look at all the side effects and main effects.  You need to know all the info before you get into things like that.  It's HIGHLY addictive, and it makes you ugly too.  It can make you mentally mucked up... turn you into a vegetable basicly.  I can't stop you, but i would seriously advise you not to.  I know what that feels like - i used to have depression and it's not the right route out really - talk to someone, theres a lot of help out there and it's up to you to take it.  Good luck with everything. xxx  <br>  <br>  Here's all the info on weed (aka cannabis)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.talktofrank.com/drugs.aspx?id=172" rel="nofollow">http://www.talktofrank.com/drugs.aspx?id...</a>|`|PMRY3osxaa	DON'T SMOKE WEED! It WILL NOT help what is going on in your life right now, only make things worse! Just because your friends do stuff like that doesn't mean you should, don't do it. The only thing it will make you become is a lifeless druggie, trust me I know a kid who smoked weed and now he looks like a complete idiot, totally non-responsive and like one of those idiotic hippies, God I can't even describe it! Trust me, you'll be healthier, smarter, and it will effect you later in life if you don't do drugs. There are no good reasons why you should.<br>  DON'T DO IT!!!<br>  <br>  Make the good choice.|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	Seriously, as long as you're not an idiot to begin with, being high is nothing to worry about. I smoke at least once a week and I still went to college at 16 and get a 3.85 GPA. I still go to work, I still have friends, I don't rob or murder people, I pay my bills. <br>  <br>  I'm not going to tell you to do it or not do it, just be aware that depending on where you are you can get in trouble with the law or your parents if you're caught. Don't do anything stupid, like drive a car.<br>  <br>  If I were in your position, though, I would wait until I wasn't depressed. You don't want your brain to start associating pot with depression, because then you'll want to do it every time you get depressed.|`|o2gjtUw9aa	omg questions like this make me wanna go have a joint<br>  noooo dude drugs are bad.<br>  you get caught you get criminal record you cant get job adn yuo commit suicide.<br>  <br>  in school or w/e you can get advice or help to stop the depressing things in yuor life but dont resort to drugs<br>  <br>  god damnnn i need a spliff<br>  *lets out smoke*<br>  ya mannn|`|NcAAqe9Iaa	you probably shouldn't. i've heard it does stay in your hair, but so does everything else you put in your body. it probably won't make you different. just hungry and lazy, which then can make you fat. and if youre a fat person nobody will want you. lol. i personally think you shouldn't but it's up to you.. it's YOUR body your doing this to.|`|lQR9fYGhaa	yes, its not addictive, and it will make you understand things around you better. <br>  <br>  <br>  there is 0% chance of you getting hurt or addicted.. the worst that could happen is Coughing from the smoke,<br>  <br>  <br>  EVERYONE trys it once.. even obama..<br>  <br>  <br>  just look at bob marley..<br>  <br>  <br>  Jah bless.|`|SQLSOeHcaa	DON'T DO IT!!!<br>  <br>  I'VE SEEN MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FACING ADDICTIONS AND THE MAJORITY I HAVE DEALT WITH HAVE ALWAYS EXPERIMENTED WITH MARIJUANA, AND LATER ON TRIED OTHER DRUGS AND GOT HOOKED ON THEM!<br>  <br>  DON'T DO IT!|`|XTj0LP6gaa	Ever person I know that has smoked weed is emotionally and mentally stunted.<br>  So, NO.|`|3fEfuPWOaa	It will make your penis smaller.

Yep, it is just like smoking.|`|OTtdTihuaa	no|`|O01oFg3Eaa	What kind of question is that?<br>  Of course you should!|`|OBT3C4zHaa	Okay, first of all, if you were to smoke weed just one time, it wouldn't stay in your system for a month. How long THC (active ingredient in Cannabis) stays in your system is completely dose dependent. If you smoked one time and took 5 or 6 hits I would bet it would be out in a week.<br>  <br>  The first time I used marijuana, it was a really interesting experience. It made everything funny, I would have really deep, meditative thoughts, everything was like in slow motion. When it would wear off though, I would be really tired and just sleep. Now that I smoke numerous times daily and have been for years, the effects aren't as strong. Now it pretty much just relaxes me. It effects everyone differently but for me, It usually makes me quiet around other people, it makes me want to be alone and do creative things. Other people I know, it makes them quite talkative and fun to be around, You just never know how it will affect somebody until they do it.<br>  <br>  As much as I enjoy it, I would recommend that you don't do it. The reasons Im saying this is because it sounds like you want to use it as an escape from the depressing stuff going on in your life. You never want to use drugs for this reason because it could make them habit forming and you need to find better ways to cope with your issues.<br>  <br>  Pretty much everything that people are going to tell you on this site is going to be a lie, for example the person a few people above me that said marijuana causes cancer. It doesn't cause cancer, in fact, numerous studies have shown that it slows cancer and protects cells from it. If you have any questions that you want answered feel free to contact me through my yahoo profile with a message or you could e-mail me|`|AA10059960	First of all how old are you? If you are not at least 21 years of age i would not recommend it. Also beaware that weed just like alcohol may make you "feel" better but it will not solve your problems. In fact if done wrong or handled immaturly it will only cause MORE problems.  You were wise enough to ask this question, so you are likely wise enough to know that it is best to handle lifes problems with a sober mind.<br>  <br>  Adults who act maturely only drink or smoke weed when there is something to celebrate or be happy about. They stay away from that stuff when they have problems because they know it does not help.<br>  <br>  As with any drug if you over expose yourself, it will have harmful and damaging effects.  If used responsibly it can be great fun, this is why adults caution teenagers not to use it, because if used like a toy it can truly cause much more harm and misery then good.|`|fD3m4HSyaa	i would STRONGLY suggest that you DON'T. <br>  i understand that you have a lot of depression, but that can be over come by means, such as some sports like batminton or squash. believe me these kinds of sport activities help a lot.<br>  smoking weed is very dangerous and unhealthy. it can cause you cancer or some other serious disease which will be worser than the depression you are facing now.<br>  yes you will become different!! you will become dumb and sick and would never be able to make freinds with good people because they wont want to stay near you!! Also you will become quiet ugly looking with time...<br>  plus you wont find a good job, especially after you are caught....so please do NOT smoke weed.|`|32713cbe56001fc024a3a2be5f7fbc1aaa	For starters, smoking weed is not going to make your depressive state go away, BUT, it will help you analyze why life is not as depressing as you think it is. Smoking weed is no big deal, dude. Its not addicting and its not going to kill you. Try it for the first time to get it over with. Its better with a close buddy then alone.<br>  <br>  Toke up for the first time and enjoy the magic dragon ride.|`|Wg4jmafUaa	i think you shouldnt . I always thought if this. You wanna try becuase u want to c how it is and how everyone makes it look. But if you do try there is that chance you will like and get addicted and become a druggie. I know you dont want that + it will make you teeth yello and you will have bad health. The smell also sticks to ur clothes and from people i know who have say it gives u headaches and a lot of migranes.!|`|J0L0hPfuaa	It is not gonna make you feel better, you will probably fall asleep, its not all great like people make it seem like, cause it will be your first time. Also you will need to shower after cause the smell is nasty.  Dont do it.. just do something esle to make your self feel better|`|ou0Wy3B0aa	NO!<br>  Let me repeat..<br>  NO!<br>  If you have problems, see a psychiatrist!!!  Get some help!! Weed dosen't fix, it breaks!|`|rfhQXkPRaa	um no.|`|Jh1DyUtQaa	Uh, my closest friends all do smoke because they say that it does make them feel better and relieve stress, etc. But, at the same time they can admit that it's an expensive and annoying habit to keep up and they'd rather just not have the desire to. It doesn't do anything for me but make me paranoid and more stressed out, so you never really know. Therefore it's prob not worth it... Are you the kind of person that has an addictive personality? Would you get hooked? Or could you hit the blunt a few times, laugh with your friends and go about your day/life? This all depends on you, but again if you're questioning it that much it's prob not worth it. And ps- it might make you temporarily lazy, but you would need to do it excessively I mean A LOT for it to 'make you dumb' lol...all I can say is you might say a few dumbass things...or feel dumb if you got caught.
96fddb9a757ebdba75745784269df9efaa	Preguntas o afirmas?<br>  <br>  NO es solo una operacion estética<br>  <br>  <br>  Adjunto informacion sobre la circunción, sigue leyendo...<br>  <br>  <br>  La CIRCUNCISIóN ES MUY BENEFICIOSA, es más limpio y saludable y numerosos estudios científicos han llegado a la conclusión de que los hombres circuncidados tienen mucho menos riesgo de contraer enfermedades sexuales tales como SIDA, sífilis o herpes. <br>  <br>  Los penes no circuncidados son más difíciles de mantener limpios, y más propensos a sufrir infecciones y cáncer de pene, han demostrado estos estudios. Un pene circuncidado se mantiene limpio prácticamente de manera natural y está virtualmente libre de infecciones urinarias. No tendrás que preocuparse más con un lavado cuidadoso del pene. <br>  <br>  Es no cierto que la AAP (Academia Americana de Pediatría) no recomiende la circuncisión. Concluyen simplemente que dejan la decisión a los padres. Pero actualmente, y especialmente después de que los recientes estudios de los Institutos Nacionales de Salud (NHI) los Estados Unidos, la AAP está debatiendo si es necesario cambiar su política y recomendar la circuncisión a todos los recién nacidos como hacían anteriormente, por lo que en un futuro podemos ver como la AAP aboga otra vez por la circuncisión. <br>  Echa una mirada en: <a href="http://www.baby-health.net/articles/381.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby-health.net/articles/381....</a> <br>  <br>  Sobre las enfermedades de origen sexual: <br>  <br>  Como he comentado, varios estudios realizados por prestigiosos centros de investigación han concluido que los penes no circuncidados son más propensos a infecciones y una contracción de enfermedades sexuales, incluyendo AIDS-HIV. Han demostrado a los hombres circuncidados tienen un riesgo de contagio hasta un 70% mas bajo que los no circuncidados. Dale una ojeada este artículo: <a href="http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.php/HealthNews/2006121404Circumcision" rel="nofollow">http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.ph...</a> <br>  <br>  En cuanto a las mujeres, los estudios también demuestran que la circuncisión igualmente protege a las parejas de los hombres circuncidados contra AIDS-HIV y otras enfermedades de origen sexual. <br>  Mira este artículo: <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2006/02_08_06.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_rel...</a> <br>  <br>  Sobre la sensibilidad del pene circuncidado:<br>  <br>  NINGúN estudio médico o fisiológico ha podido demostrar que la circuncisión reduce la sensibilidad, opuesto esto a la creencia común. <br>  Es totalmente FALSO que la circuncisión reduzca sensibilidad del pene. La Academia Americana de Pediatría (AAP) confirma esto en su Web; <br>  Mira en: <a href="http://www.aap.org/pubed/zzzjzmemh4c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aap.org/pubed/zzzjzmemh4c.htm</a> <br>  <br>  La circuncisión es un procedimiento fácil, rápido, sencillo, y hoy en día es también *indoloro* con anestesia. <br>  Tiene muchas ventajas, y virtualmente ningún riesgo. <br>  <br>  La circuncisión no es una amputación. La circuncisión no es comparable en todos a la ablación o circuncisión femenina, que es algo totalmente diferente. <br>  <br>  El número de operaciones de circuncisión están AUMENTANDO hoy en día, tanto en los Estados Unidos como en otros países. Muchas naciones de áfrica, Asia y América Latina con poca tradición en la circuncisión están empezando a promoverlo para ayudar a reducir los índices de infección del virus del SIDA. <br>  <br>  Finalmente, la siguiente página Web tiene mucha información útil e *imparcial* sobre este tema. Asegúrate de echarle un buen vistazo: <a href="http://www.circinfo.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.circinfo.net</a>|`|41959b34d8beee7289a1969be014e667aa	tambien religiosa<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuncisi%C3%B3n" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuncisi%...</a>|`|5f39a611e4e99ab8c53040e3459f539faa	La circuncisión es una operación en donde el prepucio - una pilelcita especial que cubre la parte superior del pene - se corta.<br>  No te aterres, esta operación normalmente se hace a los recién nacidos, y sólo si a sus papás les late.<br>  Duele? Sí, pero como estás mega chiquito ps ni te acuerdas, si te la hacen cuando eres grande es una cirugía menor. Es necesaria cuando el prepucio se cierra o si presenta infecciones. Después de la operación te puede molestar de dos a cuatro días y no cambia para nada tu sensibilidad, por supuesto que a esta edad te la hacen con anestecia, así qeu no te duele. <br>  En México se calcula que les hacen la circunsición al 60% de los bebés.<br>  <br>  Porqué la circunsición?<br>  EN la religión judía y la musulmana, la cincuncisión se practica desde hace siglos. También hay algunos doctores qeu la recomiendan por rollos de higiene, pero otros piensan que no es necesaria.<br>  La curcuncisión cambia la apariencia del pene (circuncidado es champi?ón, no circuncidado es como un cheto).<br>  La Organización Mundial de la Salud dice que los hombres circuncidados adquieren menos infecciones, tienen 60% menos probabilidades de cotnraer el virus del SIDA, herpes tipo 2, el virus del papiloma humano y la hepatitis B.<br>  <br>  <br>  <3 Suerte  y felices fiestas!|`|d66c21f6e8dc70c2f995cedb96f73becaa	NO!!!!! el Sida lo contraes igual! mi marido le hicieron circunscicion por una infeccion debajo en prepucio, en el anillo debajo la cabeza del mmmmmmmmm.Lo durmieron y no le dolio nada.Solo que estuvo unos días medio dormido x la anestesia total!pero le le creció JAJAJA!!!!!!!!tjxD GRRRRRRRRsandokana te saluda feliz2007|`|d4e59a9a50ea8d0f72e676492ca7c53aaa	Lo único que sé es que a PINOCHO se la hicieron con un sacapuntas.|`|b62399afa01b34f0624f15e861011df0aa	cual es la pregunta?|`|e3331d063914f770bd4b33e09ff6aa48aa	nO sOlO Es eStEtIcA Mi aMiGo tAmBiEn eS ReLiGiOsA Si nO PrEgUnTaLe aLoS HoMbReS JuDiOs qUe lEs hIcIeRoN eN Su aSuNtItO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!o aSuNtOtE IgUaL DePeNdE PeRo hAy dIfErEnTeS OpInIoNeS UnOsPiEnSaN QuE Es mAs hIgIeNiCo y oTrOs cOnTrA La mOrAl pOrQuE DiCeN QuE Es mUtIlAdOr pErO eN FiN No iMpOrTa cReO QuE Tu y yO PeNsAmOs qUe eS BuEnA AuNqUe oBvIo yO No tEnGo Q' cIrCuNcIdArME jIjIjIj!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

85BbBAQXaa	Here are a few tips I use when dieting: <br>  <br>  1) Exercise is so so so important. Running, walking, and especially swimming (because it uses all of your muscles... you lose weight so quickly if you swim!) helps your body become healthier and more toned<br>  <br>  2) Try eating healthier foods, such as salads, wheat bread, vegetables, fruits, yogurt, etc. Eat SMALL snacks between each meal, such as carrots or a yogurt. This definitely helps curb some of those food cravings you have, and makes you less ravenous during the main meals.<br>  <br>  3) For main meals, try this: Eat till your about 80% full. Chew slowly! (Remember, eating quickly doesn't mean eating less!) Then leave the table or kitchen so the food won't tempt you.<br>  <br>  4) DRINK WATER! It's so filling and helps quicken your metabolism. You can also try drinking a bottle of water before each main meal, making you less hungry. (If you don't like water, drink a fruit juice like orange juice or grapefruit juice)<br>  <br>  5) My favorite tip: If you're doing hmwk and want to munch on something, chew a peppermint or GUM. Whenever I see unhealthy foods (but yummy ones), and I'm chewing gum, I remember that I have a goal weight and must not eat it. Try it... gum helps!<br>  <br>  6) Find someone you admire, like an idol, and set them as your goal! Having an incentive truly works... such as your summer bikini!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!! :)|`|6E2DuA25aa	well, alot of people say its a croc, but i like the low carb diet, it works for me, other than that just excersize and drink lots of water|`|C9yRhzv2aa	Try not to eat ne fast foods, fried foods, soft drinks, drink plenty of water, eat salads, fruits and veggies those are  healthy for u and inexpensive.

For two weeks, record everything you eat and the amount of exercise you get. Don't try to "diet," just monitor during this time. You'll be amazed at the "stealth eating" you do. After the two weeks, review your journal while looking for patterns that can be disrupted. For me it's eating a lot of sweets and snacking on chips. Look for ways to incorporate more exercise into your daily routine. Remember, small changes make a difference. For example, I try not to drink calories and I cut out things like mayo and cheese on sandwiches. Keep in mind that 3500 calories = 1 pound, so look for ways to expend calories while cutting out unhealthy eating habits.|`|WoBGig4saa	Along with increased activity and diet I tried some Bee Pollen supplements, they are over the counter, cheap, and they do help suppress your appetite.

Sometimes done to children by implanting tubes into the ear canal to help drain them to avoid ear infections.|`|LhwNQ7J6aa	I've had this done several times at the doctor's office.  Now I just do it myself with Murine.  <br>  <br>  Note:  If you are having pain your ear is probably infected.  Don't irrigate yourself if there is possibility of infection.<br>  <br>  So here is the what and why:<br>  <br>  Your ears produce wax.  If your ear produces more wax than it can get rid of your ear will get a build up of wax.  This wax can make a plug that blocks the ear canal making it hard to hear and water and germs can get stuck back there causing infection and pain.  <br>  <br>  To treat the blockage they irrigate your ear.  To do this at the doc's office they take body temp water (if you go to hot or too cold you can get what will feel like motion sickness) and flush it into your ear generally with a large syringe.  It will take several attempts/pumps of water for it to work.  When it works the ear wax will break up and come out of your ear, usually in large disgusting chunks.  <br>  <br>  Afterward you can hear great and your ears are really clean.  You may still have some pain from a lingering infection, but the doc should give you antibiotics to fix this.  <br>  <br>  If your ear isn't infected, you can go to a drug store and buy Murine in the ear section.  It comes with this oily stuff that you put in your ears to soften the wax.  Do that for a couple of days and then follow the directions on the box to do the irrigation yourself.  <br>  <br>  Note:  this is not painful.  If for some reason when you or the person in your doctor's office does this, it shouldn't hurt.  If it feels like they are going to pop your ear drum or rupture your ear some way, stop they don't know what they are doing.  Generally it is pretty gentle.|`|QjwBMQbjaa	Hi, <br>  i have had this recently too. I got my ears syringed/irrigated..last thursday..i was very anxious about it but it was fine...infact quiet relaxing they just squirt water into your ears, its nothing at all to worry about. However, my ears are still painful so i am doubting if wax was the orignial problem. Best of luck x
rJgrwIodaa	For the most part, you're not working your abs on that machine.  It involves too many muscles that are much bigger than your abs and take over the work.  You push with your legs and arms, which prevents the abs from doing the work.<br>  <br>  The best way to work your abs is to do lots of planks, hanging leg lifts, and good old fashioned floor crunches.  There are also side planks, side crunches (on a stability ball), and leg raises.<br>  <br>  I'll explain.<br>  Planks: Get in a push-up position, spine straight (it helps to do this in front of a mirror), butt down, lower back not sagging.  Hold for a minute.  If you can't, hold as long as you can.  If you can hold it longer, go for it.  There are variations of planks.  You can do the same thing, but resting on your elbows instead of having your arms extended.  You can do side planks, which look like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.mensfitnessmagazine.co.uk/images/library_UK_0/abs_workout_2_229_7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mensfitnessmagazine.co.uk/ima...</a><br>  <br>  Hanging leg lifts work your lower abs, which are the hardest to work:<br>  <a href="http://www.bodyresults.com/_iexer/S2core3.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyresults.com/_iexer/S2core...</a><br>  <br>  Side crunches:<br>  <a href="http://www.ab-core-and-stomach-exercises.com/images/side-crunches-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ab-core-and-stomach-exercises...</a><br>  <br>  Leg raises:<br>  <a href="http://www.ab-core-and-stomach-exercises.com/images/leg-raises-pictures-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ab-core-and-stomach-exercises...</a><br>  <br>  These will give you much, much better abs than that machine.<br>  Also, you want to have some protein after you've done a workout.  I make my own protein shakes because you need to replace sugars and calories that you lose in an intense workout.  The 30-40 minutes after you've exercised are when the effects of eating protein and sugars will benefit you the most.  (Meaning your abs will get bigger if you have protein right away.)|`|ovPfkHSCaa	If you accept that what you eat has a major impact on the results you get from your muscle building plan, then the question becomes, "What are the best muscle building foods for me to eat?"

The left side is not only considered logical, but also sequential, analytical, rational, and objective, and tends to look at things in parts, rather than as a whole.  The right side of the brain is considered to be more random, looks at things in wholes rather than parts, is considered intuitive, subjective, holistic, and synthesizing.  People who tend to lean more to being "left-brained" tend to do better in most scholastic studies, based on the way schools have been set up.  The right brain is much more creative, and can do well in subjects that don't demand analytical skills.  However, although people tend to be either left or right brained, you can develop skills that help you to become "whole-brained", where you are able to use both logical and subjective skills.  There are many books available that can help you to understand the thinking processes of each side of the brain, and you can help yourself to become more proficient in the side you have less of a tendency to use.  For example, I am a registered nurse, which requires much logic and analysis, but in my free time, my favorite pasttimes include painting and playing music.|`|e1551ede513b84bd30c68c530a637abdaa	ONE  SIDE  OF  THE  BRAIN  IS  USED  FOR  SPEECH   AND  THE  OTHER  SIDE  OF  THE  BRAIN   IS  USED  FOR  CONTROLLING   OUR  BODY  FUCTIONS

ivH8tRtsaa	Your body has an internal clock that thinks it should sleep at night and be awake during the day. I once worked night-shift for three years straight. I never got used to it. I probably got more sleep when I was working night-shift, but I never felt totally awake. There have been studies that show melatonin (bodies natural sleep-aid) production is at its best if you are in bed at a decent hour. So yes, your sleeping schedule could have something to do with your symptoms.  That being said, I would also like to add that there could be legitimate medical reasons you are feeling fatigued. Anything from Lime disease to clogged arteries could be the blame. If you feel that your current symptoms are affecting your quality of life, I would strongly suggest getting a checkup and discussing your symptoms with a doctor.|`|1cmVy7Adaa	It does matter when you go to bed. If you go to bed at 10 then try to wake up at 7:00 or so. Going to bed at 4 and waking up at two is a total imbalance of time and day. I think your suffering from exhaustion. Maybe you should go visit your doctor.|`|T6V9zXymaa	One thing you don't mention is your age, but it sounds like you might be somewhat young. Generally, younger people can stay up late and awake earlier with few ill effects. I miss that resilience! I'm 39 and tend to crash early and get up early.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it shouldn't really matter whether you're going to bed early in the morning or late at night as long as you've adjusted to the schedule. If you were alternating (say, going to bed at 10pm one day then going to bed at 4am the next and so on), that would definitely have an effect.<br>  <br>  First thing I should ask is, "Are you really sleeping 10 or 12 hours each day?" Sleeping too much is just as bad as sleeping too little. 6-8 hours per day is more than sufficient as long as it's productive sleep. By productive I mean you are able to achieve REM sleep (or deep sleep) and you aren't constantly waking up during the night.<br>  <br>  You were right to look at your diet as a possible cause. Not eating properly would definitely give you the symptoms you're describing. However, don't assume that "I had a snickers bar and still felt the same way" is an accurate gauge for diabetes. Have a blood glucose test done before you rule it out as a possibility.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have trouble falling asleep and even more trouble *staying* asleep. It ended up being caused by stress and was prescribed medication to help me sleep better, but that's me and probably doesn't apply to your situation.<br>  <br>  I notice a lot of people going on to Yahoo! Answers and looking for medical advice, but trust me, unless the people answering are medical professionals (and I'm certainly not!), you'd be best served to go to your family doctor and ask him what's going on.<br>  <br>  Anyway, best of luck to you. I hope you feel better soon.

The usual reason boys masturbate so many times a day is that they don't take their time doing it, they rush to the "payoff" (orgasm and ejaculation).  Relax, take your time, maybe stop and start again a few times.  You'll get more out of it each time that way and won't need it as often.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, just be more active.  Get outside more, exercise more, hang out with your friends more.  The more things that keep you occupied, the less you'll be thinking about masturbating.

It's quick and easy to shave in the shower (go downwards with the grain of the pubic hair). You can get a cleaner shave by going against the grain but be a bit more careful as you can nick a bit and it's just a little more sensitive but makes for a really clean shave. You will love the results. :) I've literally been shaving my own bikini area for 11 years.<br>  <br>  I don't think it grows in thicker but I haven't ever let it grow out much to notice.

Rk46lIBwaa	The first REALLY big mistake is to take any of the Zopliclone that some unwise and poorly trained doctor has given you.<br>  <br>  This is one of the 2 notorious 'Z' drugs.<br>  <br>  It is so addictive that if it is taken for 3 nights in a row withdrawal symptoms will occur on the 4th night!<br>  <br>  It is a true drug of addiction becoming rapidly less effective the longer it is taken. On average long term users get to sleep 20 minutes sooner and sleep no more than 30 minutes longer than their pre-drugged state.<br>  <br>  Zopiclone is so addictive that addicted users often have to be weaned off using diazepam! (Valium) as this is LESS addictive.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	alcohol is a CNS depressant which can cause further CNS depression when added with hypnotics.

I just want you to be careful as any sleeping tablet reacts with alcohol and also will interact with a lot of other drugs. You will be ok but it will probably increase the effects of the tablet. I take sleeping tablets but have never had a drink just because im to worried what may happen. Good luck and just dont take your pill if you know you will be having a few drinks.|`|RP2QQXbjaa	Do you mean Eszopiclone (Lunesta)? Alcohol would add to the central nervous system depression caused by eszopiclone.  The CNS depression is what causes you to be sleepy from the pills in the first place, but you wouldn't want to increase that beyond what the pill provides.  CNS depression can also cause slowed breathing, slowed reflexes, blurred vision, etc.  The effects from the sleeping pill (if the correct dosage is taken) shouldn't cause such extreme effects such as slowed breathing, but adding alcohol to the mix could be dangerous.  If you do have alcohol, don't use the sleeping pill at the same time.

g71y13voaa	I actually just learned this the other day- halitosis (bad breath) is caused by the bacteria that build from nasal drip and drips onto the back of your tongue.

AA12258724	The urethra (the thing you pee from) is right above the vagina. It's also, in women, less than 2". So, the motion in sex can introduce bacteria from the external genitalia to the urethra, and from there it can travel to the bladder. (Also, wiping towards the front after defecation can do the same). <br>  <br>  The usual treatment is sulfa, not penicillin, also there is a drug called pyridium that alleviates the symptoms while waiting for the sulfa to do its thing.<br>  <br>  Whoever said it can be fatal is correct--a UTI can travel to the kidneys and from there cause a systemic infection. Best to treat early.<br>  <br>  Best prevention, as mentioned by others, is good hygiene. Also, some people are just more prone. Also some are more sensitive to the infection-causing bacteria, and can have symptoms with a low bacterial count in the urine. In the bladder, urine is sterile--no germs.|`|e4353542228be082d8905600b494182daa	It can be from sex or your cleaning after urination.  go to the doctor (for penicillin) and then be sure to always clean after going to the bathroom (and make sure your partner does also)<br>  <br>  B-Cool|`|43beac8a342b8a3bc49f2f3239032148aa	I don't think so but if you have one you better get to a doctor they can be fatal.... no kidding!!!!|`|7e5ba51938dc32b7ebcdfe15437be958aa	You can.

AA10626996	I do not know the website but what I do know about multi vitamins is that you waste your money buying a vitamin that is a tablet. Most of the tablet does not even dissolve... I would suggest Twinlab. They make multi Vitamins in a capsule form that dissolves quickly where it should..if you ever wanna do your own test on a multi Vita.. tablet , take vinegar( approx. 1cup) and mix with a 1/2cup water and put Miltie tab in it for approx. 10 minutes.If it hasn't dissolved completely, that's exactly what it will do in your body..A multi vitamin should dissolve within 10-15 minutes in your stomach...any longer and its heading for the intestines where it does no good...<br>  <br>  Also, to get the best absorbency, eat 1st and then take your multi..Hope this helps :)
RMeTRZGVaa	Orajel helps a little.<br>  <br>  But you have to be careful with wisdom teeth. Wisdom teeth can be hard to clean <br>  and are more prone to decay.Bacteria can infect the tissue surrounding partially erupted molars and cause gum disease. <br>  Crowding can cause damage to adjacent teeth and jawbone. <br>  If teeth are inpacted, cysts can form and destroy surrounding bone. You should go see your dentist pretty soon to avoid any complications.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. Hope I Helped|`|LhQ9HLWjaa	Well this is a normal thing for you teeth to hurt. If you do not have enough room in your mouth you might have to get them extracted. This will save you allot of money in the future, i.e: braces, or crowding leading to cavities because a tooth brush or floss can not reach these places properly. If you like to try a natural way to ease the pain please try a green tea bag soaked in hot water and place that on the area of pain.|`|eR6tkHhsaa	If they hurt you should get them pulled.  You can go one side at a time or do them all at once.  They may be growing in impacted, or sideways, and they hurt because there is not enough room on your jaw for the extra teeth.  If you don't get them out soon your teeth may start crowding in the front which will give you "summer teeth".....  summer here, summer there. <br>  <br>  The first set I had done the dentist did a bad job and I was in extreme pain for a week.  I waited two and a half years to pull the other side because of that experience.  The next set to go didn't phase me a bit, I rarely used pain meds and the recovery was quick.  My sister had them done all at once.  Usually you are put under anesthesia for all four to come out.<br>  <br>  800 mg motrin or ibuprofen will ease your pain, or any other over the counter items @ max strength.  Of course if you have something stronger that is nice too.  Go see your dentist to make the appointment.|`|kF60ZtQEaa	Yes. Go to the dentist and have them removed. If they are hurting that bad then they are probably not coming in the correct way. If that is true they will continue to hurt and could push on your other teeth making them crooked.|`|wRsmmkRUaa	As they go through stages of growth they will hurt but only for a couple of days then it will stop for a while.  This cycle will continue until you get them removed but at least you know the pain doesn't last forever :)<br>    Until they stop hurting, dip your toothbrush in a capful of Listerine and let the stuff drip onto the spot that hurts.  It REALLY helps me when mine are hurting (you know how numb Listerine makes your mouth feel when you swish it around?  Yeah, totally numbs the tooth).  Hope this helps, feel better!<br>  <br>  -V
3Ks21ASDaa	Get your mother or someone to look at your tonsils. If they have white patches on them then it's possibly strep.

Vitamin C is supposed to help you recover.|`|cd4b98b2256d6ae789777434f666f79daa	after a vigorous work out (if you have sweated a lot) you need to replenish the lost fluids.  drinking a supplement such as gatorade, powerade, etc., will replenish such things as electrolytes.  electrolytes, when lost, cause muscles to stay fatigued and rebuilding the electrolytes take a while.  with the consumption of gatorade, powerade, etc., you give your body the jump start of introducing the required chemicals directly back into the blood stream.  however, you have to remember, when you vigorously working out your muscles you must give them time to properly heal.  you are actually tearing down the muscle fibers to allow for more growth in the tissue that has been exercised!  it is also recommended that you drink plenty of fluids, and water is a great source to replenish and to cleanse the body of any unwanted traces that could harm the body from healing properly.

One big red flag should be when they say, "you don't actually have to see it, you just have to visualize (aka- pretend) that you are healing yourself".  Its amazing how many people want so badly to believe in crazy things.  You could probably convince yourself that you can shoot lasers out of your eyes too.<br>  <br>  Are any of you skeptical of anything at all?  Try to think of one thing that you don't believe in - UFOs, Bigfoot, anything.  I seriously don't understand how you could possibly question anything at all, and yet believe in mystical energy healing, like chakras.  If there is something that you hear and think "that is rediculous, show me some kind of evidence", then you are skeptical of it.  That same process of healthy skepticism is what I am applying to your belief in magic healing powers.<br>  <br>  So I would love it if someone could respond and tell me one thing that they are skeptical of.  And being skeptical of something, doesn't mean you are a "nay sayer", it just means you aren't gullible of everything that comes along.  Before you profess your belief in something, the evidence in favor of it needs to outweigh the evidence against it.  Give it a try.|`|x0giFK1Naa	Visualization is actually an red herring that places a layer of indirection between you and your chakras.  It's possible (and actually not too difficult) to learn to feel and manipulate your chakras directly instead.

Some can't use both ways, for one reason or another, they are using spermicidal creams, and if it cause undesirable side effects, go for the condoms, which the only method guarantee has no side effect for the woman, with the risk (70%) of getting pregnant on condoms, also some men don't like it very much (decrease the sensation during intercourse).

Walking, yoga/pilates, running, biking, dancing (DDR).<br>  <br>  The natural “diet”:  Eat, drink, and be merry<br>  <br>  Eat smart – well-balanced meals, cut out any unnecessary calories (snacking just because), eat when you are hungry (grumbling stomach, hunger pains) and only eat until you are satisfied (not a bite more), 5-6 smaller meals is better than 3 larger ones.  Also, stop eating 2-3 hours before bed – you should be slightly hungry at bed time<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water, not only to stay hydrated, but its important for weight loss, including helping the muscles tone and suppressing hungry.  (Tip – the lighter your urine the more hydrated you are.)<br>  <br>  Be merry – in other words exercise, not only is it needed for weight loss, it releases chemicals in your brain and makes you more happy (some of it is addicting which is known to a lot as “runner’s high”).  30 minutes of cardio is recommended daily, and a good work out program uses cardio and weight training (even if it’s just toning – light weights, more reps).

afe0cc0e4350bf139f673e584596a2b1aa	Before I answer your question I just want to state that I am a Dental Technologist not a Dentist. Dental Technologists only make dental prosthesis with a prescription from a Dentist and we do not give out medical advice.  Thus, any comments I make are just personal thoughts and should not be taken as medical advice. So GO TO YOUR DENTIST!!!!!<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question, I live in Canada so I don’t know the prices in the US but any implant is pricey. For your second question, no it doesn’t happen that fast. You need to take x-rays and have a case plan made out. Then depending on what you need (I don’t know you situation) you will have impressions taken one day (to make a surgical stent and flipper). Then you will need surgery another day to place the implants into the bone and have a healing cap placed so then your tissue can heal. After 6weeks you can go back again and have the healing cap taken out and have a crown put in. BUT not all dentist do the same procedure and depending on what implant is used there are different steps.<br>  <br>  This web site may help you find a dentist in your area <a href="http://www.1800dentist.com/?CMP=KNC-overture&ovmkt=S06FH1I00L3R0SM95OE3BE18E0" rel="nofollow">http://www.1800dentist.com/?CMP=KNC-over...</a><br>  <br>  This website has videos that show some implant procedures<br>  <a href="http://www.innovalife.com/index/InnovaLife-Education#" rel="nofollow">http://www.innovalife.com/index/InnovaLi...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helped you|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	One tooth can be as high as $1,000 !

From my experience in life, I have discovered that no one loves ourselvs compeltely at all times... Somtimes, we do, sometimes we don't.  It does not matter how beautiful or skinny others think you are, it is only important what you think of you.   I have had my share of addictions, my story is no better or different than anyone else.. we all suffer.  If it is food for you, it is food.  It may be drugs for another, but it is suffering.  It is the one thing that you want most that hurts you the most, it is a terrible circle and quite painful.  It is hard to build a self imiage of yourself that you can fall in love with... But I belive that is self love, compassion for self and letting go of ego, is the only way to gain "self control" - but it really should be how do I teach myself self love.  Becuase when you have unconditional love for yourself, you will see that your beauty is beyond how much you weigh or don't.  It is about being a good person to you and to others, about being harmless to yourself and to others.  There is no right or wrong way to do this.  You are 18, you will discover that you will feel the same way at 25, at 30 and beyond.  Insecurity of self is not unique or special in anyway.  EVERYONE feels insecure about who they are at one point or another.  Let it go, be who you are.  You will find love, you will find hate you will find joy and sadness all your life.  It is a perception you have of YOU only, let it go or you will suffer, just like me and everyone else.  You will go to college and it will not kill you.  Relax, don't beat yourself up.  It is a very bad habbit.. Try loving you for who you are and you just may find that you are a good person, and that food, drugs whatever it is in your life that causes you to suffer, no longer has power over you.|`|1qU29bFgaa	Try the Atkins diet.  I know it has been bad mouthed in the media, but it works.  Buy one of his books at WalMart for $6 and learn how it works.  The cravings stem not just from a lack of self control, but also from the foods that the government has been telling us are healthy.

It's not about thinking ahead about the consequences, because something inside your head just says, "So what? It's one little bowl of ice cream; just ONE can't hurt."<br>  What I try to do is go online and track just about EVERY vitamin, mineral, thing that sounds really gross and is bad for me, and every time I eat something I know I shouldn't, I look at the numbers. Really, it's enough to put me on an eating hiatus for at least a few hours. By that time, I'll have gone and done something really useful to my health, and I'll lay off the Coke and chips for a while.<br>  <br>  Thirteen-year-olds work in simple ways. What works for one brain does not always work for another, especially in age gaps. Side effects of looking at gross numbers online can include but are not limited to: nausea, dependency, eventual immunity, anorexia, bulimia, and headaches.

I tested 'HIV' positive nearly 17 years ago and was on a drug cocktail for about a year and a half, until I discovered the dissenting scientific, alternative medical perspective on the 'HIV=AIDS' infectious myth-conception. That was seven years ago and I don't take any medication and am alive and well. Turns out none of these drugs have been demonstrated in any completed [not stopped early] and placebo-controlled [drug vs no drug comparisons] to actually extend life or reduce illnesses attributed to 'AIDS.' Liver failure was announced at a recent International AIDS Conference [Barcelona] to be the number one cause of death among those so diagnosed, not the illnesses attributed to 'AIDS.' Makes you wonder what's worse, the condition or the socalled cure?<br>  <br>  If you go to the CDC or NIH or AIDS Industry organizations, they are going to give you one side of the story on the safety and efficacy of 'AIDS' drug cocktails.

ea998e6d5375bd90056eb379d9dd22ceaa	What is Bacterial Vaginosis?<br>  <br>  Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal condition in women. It is caused by an excess growth of bacteria normally present in the vagina. The vagina normally contains many kinds of bacteria that keep the vagina healthy. When the acidity of the vagina changes, these bacteria can overgrow, thus causing bacterial vaginosis. The acidity of the vagina can be changed by menstruation (the woman's period), sexual intercourse, douching, antibiotics or the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases. <br>  <br>  Who gets bacterial vaginosis?<br>  Bacterial vaginosis usually affects women between 15-44 years of age. It may occasionally occur in younger girls and older women. It most often occurs in sexually active women.<br>  <br>  How is bacterial vaginosis spread?<br>  Sexually active women have bacterial vaginosis more often than women who are not. It is unclear, however, if bacterial vaginosis is sexually transmitted. The infection has a tendency to occur again even when the partner has been treated.<br>  <br>  What are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?<br>  A vaginal discharge is a common symptom. There is often a foul or fishy odor, especially after having intercourse. Occasionally, there may be itching.<br>  <br>  What complications can result from bacterial vaginosis?<br>  There is some concern that bacterial vaginosis may be involved in some cases of infections of the uterus (womb) especially after vaginal delivery. However, more research is needed to clarify these issues. <br>  <br>  Does past infection make a person immune?<br>  No. Bacterial vaginosis can occur whether the woman is sexually active or not and whether the partner is treated or not.<br>  <br>  What is the treatment for bacterial vaginosis?<br>  Antibiotics given by mouth is the preferred treatment. A vaginal cream, different than the one given for yeast infections, is also available.<br>  <br>  What should I do if I have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?<br>  Avoid sexual intercourse and contact your doctor or an STD clinic. You should be examined so the right diagnosis can be made and treatment given. <br>  <br>  What can be done to prevent the spread of STDs?<br>  <br>  Abstinence is the only sure way to avoid STDs. <br>  The kinds of sex that do not include vaginal, anal or oral intercourse are also "safer sex" and less likely to spread STDs. <br>  Try to limit your exposure to STDs. Unprotected sexual activity increases your chance of exposure and infection. If you have more than one partner or your partner has other sexual partners this increases your chances of getting an STD. <br>  Use barrier protection, like a condom. <br>  Look at your partner before having sex. If you see any sign of an infection such as rashes, sores, discharge or swelling, stop and talk about the importance of checking for an STD before having sex. <br>  If you think you are infected, avoid any sexual contact and visit a local sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic, hospital or your own doctor. If possible, bring your sex partner(s) with you so that they can be treated if necessary.|`|f828526a9ebdf49b1adc9bd7a17b5fefaa	yes i think it can!|`|d1efbb4481d4af1d8c650f6703a772acaa	As a representative of all men of the world....I would like to respond by saying........EWhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Puede ser el tabique desviado, lo cual se corrige facilmente con una cirugia, podes tener APNEA, que es un sindrome del sue?o en el que se presentan varios problemas respiratorios, inclusive podes dejar de respirar por segundos. Tambien puede ser causada por rinitis, como es mi caso, ya que los cornetes estan inflamados. Los cornetes son unas bolitas que todos tenemos en la nariz pegadas al tabique, cuando se inflaman obstruyen el paso de aire por las vias respiratorias, asi que el cuerpo decide tomar el oxigeno por la boca. Yo lo solucione tomando pastillas para la alergia, puede ser clorotrimeton, alegra o loratadina, ademas con gotas nasales para destrancar la nariz, con esto vas a ver que podras dormir con la boca cerrada. Ademas, trata de cuidar la postura al dormir, coloca la almohada de forma que te levante un poco desde la espalda. Dulces sue?os amiga.|`|8c951c2ba25c5629fe6ce3f3f86a352eaa	Si duermes con la boca abierta es porque tienes problemas al respirar y no te has dado cuenta, lo que debes hacer es ir al medico preferentemente a un especialista (otorrino-laringologo) y exponerle tu problema.

Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported."<br>  <br>  "<br>  Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of overdose or the risk of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with established treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section.<br>  <br>  Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of paracetamol, however, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."|`|R5qwk15Laa	You will die.

Then, depending on the extent of the fracture, this will determine the treatment.  If a minor chip, the dentist may do nothing.  If a larger fracture, he/she may be able to put in a composite filling (white filling)......probably be in the vicinity of $40 - $70.

I followed the 8 min routine for legs and then the one for my arms, and I have never ever gotten such good results with ANY workout. I did it 5 times a week and started seeing results within a couple weeks. And YES, the arm one worked the chest, and also shoulders, biceps, forarms, back, triceps, and even wrists! The key thing that this set of workouts do is called Sectional Progression, where they work one muscle group, and then move onto the next muscle thats above or below. That way you arent jumping around to different workouts too. And they also do Isometrics in the arm one, where u dont even have to use weights. Its about pushing muscle to muscle and creating the weight and force, but that takes a lot of concentration. The bottom line is that it DOES work and DOES work ur chest, that is if it is the same thing that I am talking about. And if it isnt, then u need to try it!

Try drinking more water,and eating healthier, and you will see a huge improvement. Also try buying Cuticle oil. They help keep your cuticles growing,and will stop them from cracking,and drying up.|`|5ca268ba856660c251b3532850a56a7daa	I would see your doctor. It sounds like it may be a fungal infection... mom might be right! If they are brittle and your cuticles swollen it sounds like it is some sort of infection. But only a doctor can diagnose this. You can try over the counter meds such as anti fungal creams just to see if it helps. It could be just really dry skin too, Vitamin E liquid (usually found in health food stores) can help with that. If it is helping with the vit E then I would drink more water and eat more foods high in vitamins... A vitamin deficiency can also be the culprit. It is common to have nail and hair issues when someone is Vitamin deficient. You can pick up multi vitamins anywhere. So, choose what you want, but I would try to see a doctor first and see what he/she says. Good luck!|`|97c197eab0ca8d83e87591af461127abaa	I highly doubt you have a fungal infection.  Unless your actual nail bed is discolored or starting to become misshapen, it's most likely that you simply have dry nails.  In the past, I always recommended a NATURAL oil to my clients - most lotions won't help, as they mostly contain mineral oil, which isn't absorbed by your body.  Use a great cuticle oil like Creative's Solar Oil, OPI's Avoplex, or even plain almond oil from a health food store - some of my clients have actually used olive oil from their pantry and said it works great.  For best results, use that oil twice a day - once in the morning, once in the evening, and stay away from products containing high volumes of alcohol (like hand sanitizers).  When you wash your hands, try to use a heavy hand cream afterward.  <br>  Above all, remember that your nail bed must grow out to notice any permanent improvement.  Whatever damage is done to your nails by dehydration will have to grow out.  The oil will help keep it flexible in the meanwhile.|`|9pzg1B0Jaa	drying out probably use lotion and soak your hands in the tub if you take a bath.

119f756ae91562c2467932978c1dfa2baa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Here is your problem.  There is really no such thing as "targeted" weight loss (as much as people may tell you otherwise).  For example, you can do 100-sit ups a day- properly- for 2 months and you won't necessarily have a flat stomach because all you will have done is strengthen and tone the muscles UNDER your stomach fat.<br>  <br>  In order to lose a lot of excess ab fat, you have to lose weight- no and, ifs, or buts about it.  You have to eat right (which might not be "dieting" necessarily, but could be just eating a balanced diet) and exercise.  This is my suggestion: I work out 4 times a week for 1 hr- 1.5 hour at a time.  I weight train every day (I work different muscles depending on what day it is), and twice a week, I take Pilates, which is AWESOME for your abs because Pilates is all about stengthening and toning your core.  <br>  <br>  Try to work out an exercise plan, adjust your diet, and look up some Pilates or intense Yoga classes.  Pilates works so well that you don't even need to do sit-ups or other ab work if you don't want to (although if you're trying to lose your ab weight fast, you should maybe do crunches and sit-ups on your own time as well- start with 15-20 crunches and sits-ups a day, then increase.)|`|f0c76216b9bbf24a56744310a20d6a20aa	Exercise everyday like jogging around the block<br>  Skip meals.

17f307f983a2cbea78b5bdc5899251d9aa	Vitamin B12 is a member of the vitamin B complex. It contains cobalt, and so is also known as cobalamin. It is exclusively synthesised by bacteria and is found primarily in meat, eggs and dairy products. There has been considerable research into proposed plant sources of vitamin B12. Fermented soya products, seaweeds, and algae such as spirulina have all been suggested as containing significant B12.<br>  <br>  Vitamin B12 is necessary for the synthesis of red blood cells, the maintenance of the nervous system, and growth and development in children. Deficiency can cause anaemia. Vitamin B12 neuropathy, involving the degeneration of nerve fibres and irreversible neurological damage, can also occur. <br>  <br>  Vitamin B12's primary functions are in the formation of red blood cells and the maintenence of a healthy nervous system. B12 is necessary for the rapid synthesis of DNA during cell division. This is especially important in tissues where cells are dividing rapidly, particularly the bone marrow tissues responsible for red blood cell formation.<br>  <br>  B12 plays a vital role in the metabolism of fatty acids essential for the maintainence of myelin. Prolonged B12 deficiency can lead to nerve degeneration and irreversible neurological damage. <br>  <br>  When deficiency occurs, it is more commonly linked to a failure to effectively absorb B12 from the intestine rather than a dietary deficiency. Absorption of B12 requires the secretion from the cells lining the stomach of a glycoprotein, known as intrinsic factor. The B12-intrinsic factor complex is then absorbed in the ileum (part of the small intestine) in the presence of calcium. Certain people are unable to produce intrinsic factor and the subsequent pernicious anaemia is treated with injections of B12. <br>  <br>  Vitamin B12 can be stored in small amounts by the body. Total body store is 2-5mg in adults. Around 80% of this is stored in the liver. <br>  <br>  Vitamin B12 is excreted in the bile and is effectively reabsorbed. This is known as enterohepatic circulation. The amount of B12 excreted in the bile can vary from 1 to 10ug (micrograms) a day. People on diets low in B12, including vegans and some vegetarians, may be obtaining more B12 from reabsorption than from dietary sources. Reabsorption is the reason it can take over 20 years for deficiency disease to develop in people changing to diets absent in B12. In comparison, if B12 deficiency is due to a failure in absorption it can take only 3 years for deficiency disease to occur.|`|WOf4THqyaa	To treat anemia|`|b1611dfb8ec455bf3b50af10ea6f1ac0aa	Vitamin B12 helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells [1-4].

Vitamin B12 is also called cobalamin because it contains the metal cobalt [1-4].<br>  <br>  Vitamin B12 is bound to the protein in food. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach releases vitamin B12 from proteins in foods during digestion. Once released, vitamin B12 combines with a substance called intrinsic factor (IF).

djrcJ0QIaa	You definitely want to check the pills for side effects. One of the most common side effects for oral contraception is nausea and vomitting. Don't worry it doens't last long.  The OBGYN that I work for always recommends to our new moms after delivery is to take the pills at night when you are about to go to bed, same time every night that is, with either saltine crackers or a full 8oz glass of water and it takes away the feeling of being sick.  You also have to relize that your body just went through a tramatic experience of childbirth and it will take time for it to readjust.  If your still not comfortable with this feeling and you think there is a possibility of pregnancy contact your OBGYN right away for your own peace of mind.  You can never be to concerned when it comes to your body. Good Luck.|`|iiExfNYQaa	call the Drs office to see him or read directions to see if a side affect is nausea
djrcJ0QIaa	I work for an OBGYN who does the endometrial ablation in the office now. You can expect some slight bleeding after the procedures but it should definitely not be as bad or worse then before the surgery.  Alot of our patients love the endometrial ablation b/c it is a less complicated procedure than a hyster and the recovery time in maybe 3 days as to 3-6 weeks after a hyster.  You can expect some discharge, dark spotting, and maybe some slight cramping the 1st few days but nothing can compare to not having your period ever again.  If you would like to know more, here is the website I give all of my patients interesting in the ablation, hopefully this might ease your worries and expectations.  www.Novasure.com<br>  Good Luck.|`|tzZnjlIiaa	I had the novasure one.

I ran outta vicodins and had trouble sleeping.|`|AAZ6mibxaa	I have had a D & C, laporoscopy, and hysterscopy done on 3 seperate occurances.  I suffered from Endometriosis, and under went 3 surgeries.  I had a little bleeding, not like a period, but it was enough to wear a pad for a few days.    I was able to treat my endometriosis with herbs and have had 2 Dr.'s confirm that I no longer have it.  It also helped balance my abnormal cycles and excessive bleeding (and cramping).   I really guess that it depends on the person as to how much you will bleed, and if there are any complications to the procedure.  As far as recovery goes, if they also inflate your stomach with gas, it takes a few days for that to dissapate and can be more uncomfortable than the procedure itself.  I had horrible pains across my shoulders from the gas, and I had to sleep in a recliner for 4 days until all the gas left my abdomen.  When I would lay down, I had the sensation that I couldn't breathe and my chest would feel tight.   This is one side effect you can expect with the gas.   I would say you will feel much better by day 3 or 4.  Good luck to you!

My son had it when he was 4 and he did fine with the acid and the cream.  They lasted for about 2 months, it is a virus so they continue to pop back up until it has run its course.  With treatment it is less of a breakout.  It did not leave any scars either|`|35cd9ef8010cdc665d566283dd3a1549aa	Huh?

w6Bfrosqaa	The test does not take long to do, it involves an automated full blood count, and a blood film to look for atypical lymphocytes under the microscope.  If there are atypical lymphocytes then an antibody test is done to check for the Epstein-Barr virus.  the whole process takes around an hour but it depends how busy the lab is - its not usually a high priority test.<br>  <br>  results will be back with your doctor in a couple of days.|`|hyjZ6jSBaa	5ish days , but you can phone in to ask if theyre in and then book an appointment if they are in.
Rk46lIBwaa	It might have been rather useful if you had been able to name the drug in question.<br>  <br>  The commonest first line oral drugs for acne are all tetracyclines. The older ones such as tetracycline itself and oxytetracycline are still used but probably have little place in modern practice. <br>  <br>  They are not particularly effective, twice a day, interact with food, milk and antacids. Better choices are lymecycline and minocycline which are very safe drugs.|`|Fftw5yATaa	NO!  Talk to your doctor.

BG8vMyZjaa	A boil is an abscess (a faruncle or carbuncle) and it usually occurs because a hair follicle or sweat gland in the skin has become blocked. Bacteria (usually Staphylococcus aureus) multiply within the matter that builds up behind the blockage and forms a focus of infection. The body's immune system attempts to isolate the problem and the result it a painful collection of pus within, sometimes extending below, the skin.<br>  The reason you get them probably has something to do with the type of skin you possess and the kind of bacteria that colonise it. Up to 20 per cent of the population tend to carry the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on their skin. If you were a carrier, then you would probably be more likely to get boils if you have that skin-type. This is nothing to do with hygiene and we don't know why some people become carriers. However, using an antiseptic cleanser in your daily bath or shower for a week, then twice weekly for several weeks, can reduce the amount of Staphylococcus on your skin, although it may also cause a some dryness.|`|Cl2nEDtZaa	GO TO THE DOCTOR!!!|`|STn1aFJUaa	Some have to be removed, but the only thing my doctor told me to do is. 1. dry the areas after bathing with a blow dryer, make sure the areas are good and dry. 2. this sounds strange but the infection can spread in your sleep through your exhale, so put some of the neosporin  or whatever its called on the inside of nostrils at night, because without even realizing it you touch your nose in the middle of the night. That neosporin stops the germs from spreading. There is a soap I have at home I can not remember the name but, I will check it really helps its much better then antibacterial soap.|`|WAhfq2xwaa	I used to have this problem. I found out it was a staph infection spread by my razor. I started out just using a disposable razor once and then throwing it away and it cleared up. Now I have found that if I rinse my razor in alcohol after I use it and let it dry on the counter, that that works too. I haven't had a boil in about 2 years since I made that change.

UuGOHHG5aa	Can you explain  a bit more ?   Sponge Kidney is a diagnosis , underlying  just means that its the reason behind some other presentation . Did you read "underlying  sponge kidney"  on the IVP result ? I dont see how  sponge kidney could present with stress incontinence ,  unless  there is  chronic  infection  .<br>  edit<br>  "renal failure to contrast"  also  if you got that  from the IV pyelogram report , it means the kidney  failed to remove the contrast  from the blood into the urine , which means it must have  reduced function .<br>  you should be asking your doctor about this , i dont understand how you could have undergone  investigations and then not have the results explained to you .<br>  edit<br>  it means  that  the kidney performance is getting worse  because  of a preexisting (possibly  congenital)  condition which is  the  medullary sponge disease .   Dont worry if your other kidney is not affected it should be enough , just follow  the diet  your doctor  prescribes to you  .

You usually dream about things that you do not think about during waking hours. In some cases, you may dream about things you think about, but it happens very rarely. Dreams are  way for our subconscious mind to get out what it's been withholding throughout the day. You can be awake but still see the thing that scared you in your dream in front of your face. I've had this happen myself. I dreamt someone was trying to kill me and they had me on the ground and their face was right in my face, and I woke up in my bedroom but their face was still right on top of me, like they were really there. I closed my eyes and screamed and when i opened them the face was gone. Sometimes the image of your nightmares stays with you when you're awake and seem very real, though they are not. Nothing to worry about. The mind is a powerful thing.|`|xqQO81Omaa	I've had that exact same thing.

And I think that is what is happening, I think you are dreaming it, and it's very real, but you wake yourself up and think it is ACTUALLY real. There was no need to post this in mental health - I certainly don't think that is an issue here.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	it's possible you're seeing a shadow of something that looks like a spider.  when you're just waking up, you're not necessarily coherent and maybe your mind thinks its seeing something that isn't there.  <br>  <br>  if this happened more frequently then i'd maybe say go see a doctor, but the occurrences are not very frequent.  keep an eye on things and make a journal.  if it happens again, write down what you ate the night before, how much you slept, if you had any dreams, your mood the night before, anything else you can remember.  keep a track of this journal and see if you notice any patterns.|`|fLKN5nbkaa	It probably has something to do with dreaming. When you wake up, you think you are awake but most likely, you aren't. You are still asleep..almost sleep walking (even though you aren't walking). This has happened to me when I thought I saw my brother in my room! The next morning I asked and he never came...If it keeps happening, though, go to a sleep specialist. Hope this helped!
rhHgrohdaa	you would NOT be having "prego" symptoms this soon.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	You may be pregnant but it is way too early to tell.  You are either going to have to wait until you miss a period or see your gynecologist for a blood test.  No matter what, the pull out method is never reliable, women can and do still get pregnant from the pre-c*m (pre-ejaculate) that comes out of the penis before actual ejaculation.  The fact that you are physically uncomfortable is one of the first signs of early pregnancy.  I hope you are prepared for this one hon. Good luck!|`|pfjxEZBmaa	LEss than a week ago this happened?

I found my sleep to be quite disturbed after stopping, i'm no scientist, but i would say it's your body looking for something it hasn't benn getting something it's been used to.

If any develop or change in intensity, inform your doctor as soon as possible. Only your doctor can determine if it is safe for you to continue using nicotine patches.<br>  <br>      * More common side effects may include:<br>        Dizziness, high blood pressure, itching and burning at the application site, nausea, redness of the skin<br>  Do not smoke, chew, or sniff any form of tobacco while wearing a patch; doing so could give you an overdose of nicotine. Be aware that for several hours after you remove a patch, nicotine from the patch is still in your skin and passing into your bloodstream, so you should not smoke even when the patch is off.<br>  <br>  The use of nicotine patches may aggravate certain medical conditions. Before you use any brand of nicotine patch, make sure your doctor knows if you have, or have ever had, any of the following conditions:<br>  <br>  Allergies to drugs, adhesive tape, or bandages<br>  Chest pain from a heart condition (angina)<br>  Diabetes requiring insulin injections<br>  Heart attack or heart disease<br>  High blood pressure (severe)<br>  Irregular heartbeat (heart arrhythmia)<br>  Kidney disease<br>  Liver disease<br>  Overactive thyroid<br>  Skin disease<br>  Stomach ulcer<br>  <br>  Nicotine, from any source, can be toxic and addictive. Do not use nicotine patches any longer than your doctor prescribes or the product instructions recommend. Thoroughly discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of nicotine replacement therapy.<br>  <br>  If your heartbeat becomes irregular or you have heart palpitations, stop using the patch and call your doctor. Do the same if redness caused by the patch doesn't go away in 4 days or if your skin swells or develops a rash.<br>  <br>  Nicotine patches sometimes can cause vivid dreams or other sleep disturbances. If this happens, take the patch off at bedtime.<br>  <br>  Do not use a patch if its pouch is unsealed.<br>  <br>  The safety and effectiveness of nicotine patches have not been tested in children. Over-the-counter Nicotrol is not for use by children under age 18.<br>  <br>  Because a used nicotine patch still contains enough nicotine to poison a child or a pet, you must dispose of used patches with special care. Wrap each patch in the opened pouch or aluminum foil in which it came and throw it in a trash receptacle that is out of the reach of youngsters and animals|`|qBjXReT6aa	Hi there...<br>  <br>  When you sleep there are different types of sleeping... for you to feel refreshed in the morning the need to enter the park of sleep called REM... which can take a couple of hours to reach...<br>  <br>  if you keep waking up after you dreams then i would think you are not getting into this stage of sleep leaving you tired.<br>  <br>  I gave up using patches...

The first tell is that there is a pimple like fistula on the gum next to the tooth, this is usually accompanied by a foul odor, drainage, and pain. Not all infected teeth hurt at first, and not all infected teeth have a draining fistula that is visible.  If a tooth has an abscess sometimes, the pressure pushes the tooth out of placement a bit, so you may hit that tooth first when you bite down. The best thing you can do is go have an x-ray taken of your tooth. If there is an infection it will show up on the x-ray around the apex of the tooth. But that is if it is the tooth that is infected and not the gum. If it is a small infection that doesn't show on an x-ray, your dentist can do multiple tests to see if the tooth is vital or not.  If it is infected you probably should be on an antibiotic anyhow, which your dentist would prescribe. Go see a professional to have a proper diagnosis.|`|9b30757b8b542a2781decc599f6a6e02aa	throbbing pain, sensitivity to hot, swelling... go to the dentist so he can take x-ray|`|DsEEATKSaa	Pain, odor, fever, etc<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/abscessed_tooth/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/abscessed_too...</a>
kUCVLuTPaa	some people have painful menstruation which is sounds like you have..<br>  Painful menstrual periods are periods in which a woman experiences crampy lower abdominal pain, sharp pain that comes and goes, aching pain, or possibly back pain.<br>  Alternative Names<br>  <br>  Menstruation - painful; Dysmenorrhea; Periods - painful; Cramps - menstrual; Menstrual cramps<br>  Considerations<br>  <br>  Painful menstruation affects many women. For a small number of women, the discomfort makes it difficult to perform normal household, job, or school-related activities for a few days during each menstrual cycle. Painful menstruation is the leading cause of lost time from school and work among women in their teens and 20s.<br>  <br>  The pain may begin several days before, or just at the start of your period. It generally subsides as menstrual bleeding tapers off.<br>  <br>  Although some pain during menstruation is normal, excessive pain is not. The medical term for excessively painful periods is dysmenorrhea.<br>  <br>  There are two general types of dysmenorrhea:<br>  <br>      * Primary dysmenorrhea refers to menstrual pain that occurs in otherwise healthy women. This type of pain is not related to any specific problems with the uterus or other pelvic organs.<br>      * Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that is attributed to some underlying disease or structural abnormality, either within or outside of the uterus.<br>  <br>  Activity of the hormone prostaglandin, produced in the uterus, is thought to be a factor in primary dysmenorrhea. This hormone causes contraction of the uterus and levels tend to be much higher in women with severe menstrual pain than in women who experience mild or no menstrual pain.<br>  Common Causes<br>  <br>      * Endometriosis<br>      * Fibroids<br>      * Intrauterine Device (IUD)<br>      * Ovarian cysts<br>      * Pelvic inflammatory disease<br>      * Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)<br>      * Sexually transmitted diseases<br>      * Stress and anxiety|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, there is no reason you should have to suffer with that much pain.

li8lt5cBaa	Marijuana has proven to be effective for some pain, but frankly for the kind of pain you've got you're looking at negative ROI in using it, both for the legal aspect if you get caught (unless it's legal where you are), and the long term lung problems it can develop. The other key factor here is that you're only concentrating on the symptoms and not the cause, and before you take anything for pain you need to know exactly what you're dealing with, as some meds can actually make your symptoms worse.<br>  <br>  Medical Marijuana is a DEA Schedule 1 drug, meaning as far as they're concerned it's illegal. DEA Schedules 2, 3, 4 & 5 contain the various prescription pain meds authorized for medical use (The Schedules are the list of Controlled Substances). Only patients in special circumstances are prescribed medical marijuana, and it's usually either patients with glaucoma or terminal cancer. The kind of pain you have doesn't even come close. The only thing you're going to get if you keep smoking it for pain is a lot worse pain from other sources you don't want to contemplate. There are other, better ways to deal with the problem you have.<br>  <br>  Right now you're in that zone where you've been in a lot of pain you're not used to dealing with and have had no solution for, and have suddenly found one. That's a powerful psychological boost and draw, especially if you've been dealing with it for some time and haven't seen any other possibility for help or relief. But it's one that you need to be wary of. Once you find a way to get pain relief, you'll always want to do what it takes to keep the pain away - that's just our nature. But you've not really done what you need to do to take care of the problem - if you only treat the symptoms you'll only wind up worse off later on.<br>  <br>  Just because one doctor couldn't find anything doesn't mean you should give up. We are all unfortunately taught from the cradle to trust doctors at their word. After 3 spinal operations, 11 years of formal Pain Management (I've been on opiate therapy for most of that time) I can honestly tell you that you should NEVER take a doctor at his/her word. Doctors are human and make mistakes too - worse yet, they have egos as big a lawyers and some will even string you along even when they don't know what your problem is because they don't want to be upstaged by someone better, or admit that they don't know. The kind of pain you're describing is very common with certain problems, and can be diagnosed rather easily. However, I'm betting the guy who tested you didn't bother to mention that, and you took what he said at face value and have suffered for it. Unfortunately there are more people like those around today - always remember that the person who finishes at the bottom of their class in Medical School will eventually be called "Doctor" as well. That doesn't mean they're any good or you should trust them blindly at their word.<br>  <br>  Your best weapon is to research and learn as much about the probable causes of the pain you have. Having had the same type of pain you've had, I know for a fact it can be caused by several things - one, a disk problem in your neck, and two, an injury to the ulnar nerve at either the elbow or the wrist. Each will cause the kind of pain in the fingers you're describing.<br>  <br>  Cervical disks (neck disks) control the nerves in our arms and hands. They are traced down the cervical spine, across the shoulder and down the arm. The pain area indicates which disk the problem is at, as all nerves can be traced to certain disks. The nerve you're indicating is between C5/6/7. As far as wrist or elbow problems, any injury or damage to the ulnar nerve will cause the same thing in your pinky, because that's where the ulnar nerve path ends. If you've got a problem where you're bending your wrists too much when typing,  it will also cause the problem you have.<br>  <br>  You should be looking for either a Neurosurgeon, Neurologist, or a Pain Specialist (stay away from Anesthesiologists - they're great at putting people to sleep, and know pain drugs, but they don't know jack about pain control. They're just on the bandwagon) to track down the source of your pain. <br>  <br>  One thing you should start doing even before you see one of those (I'd opt for a Neurosurgeon first, then a Pain Doctor - Neurosurgeons usually know without testing what your problem is because they see the symptoms every day of most problems that people have) is to start keeping a Pain Diary. Pain Diaries are good for 2 reasons - first, when you finally see a doctor who knows what they're doing, you've got documented evidence of your pain. Second, that evidence will help a doctor with a diagnosis, and will also show that you're sincere and not just looking for pain drugs. I know that sounds harsh, but the realities are that there are many people out there who try to fake it just to try and get painkillers from their doctors. Real pain is very difficult to fake, and documentation of real pain is even ha|`|dVMM8RgWaa	Marijuana Is starting to be used in cancer patients for pain.

I love it, but it's totally necessary though because I feel like I would die if things weren't like this.<br>  <br>  Living by yourself can be tough, but one of the best things it does, is it can really allow you to live healthy and be happy. Perhaps you can find part time job and use the money to purchase some of your own food. Sounds strange but you have to do what you have to do.<br>  <br>  My parents have extremely strong personalities and are not flexible people at all. There is no "discussion" of who will make what for each meal and there's no negotiating what gets eaten. My mom loves fast food and never turns down pizza or tacos. If it's not fast food it's Chinese food and it's heavy on the meat. Very unbalanced, but like I said, both my mom and dad were born very strong physically (natural strength) and they can get away with it without affecting their ability to get work done.|`|FxvOEYtaaa	Maybe it's stress.

7s5OU7Sxaa	unless you are extremely overweight don't expect much change in a month. even if you change to a healthy diet it will still be the amount of calories you eat that determine how much weight you lose in a month.<br>  i was about 40lbs overweight and it took me 5months to lose 30lbs eating only 1300 to 1500cals a day which means i was hungry every day for 5months.|`|cHkH7ESuaa	Yep, you'll see results.  But here's the thing to remember, nutrition also plays a huge role.  The equation for weight loss is simple - burn more calories than you consume.<br>  <br>  To really boost your weight loss / stomach flattening efforts, you should add in some spurts of running.  A good example is this: walk for 20 minutes, then run for 10 minutes, then walk for 20 minutes, then run for 10 minutes (for a total of 1 hour).|`|pXkNR7CRaa	Seems you would lose weight, but make sure you eat enough (at least your basic metabolic rate) and have a good ratio of carbs, fat, and protein.<br>  <br>  And why just walking? More intense cardio mixed in with strength training would yield much better results. Just cardio and being in a calorie deficit attributes to muscle loss, but strength training can help you retain muscle. (Think, "Feed the muscle, burn the fat").<br>  <br>  And you can't target weight loss in any body part.|`|7sPa32GSaa	No you won't lose all stomach fat.. and you don't give enough information about yourself to find out how much you will lose.  To lose one pound, you need to burn 3500 calories.  This can come from eating less and exercising more.  I could go on and on and on about how you can calculate how much weight you will lose, but the best advice I can give is to sign up for a free online program to track what you eat, how much you exercise (how many calories you burn) and then keep track of your weight.  Check out my favorite, www.sparkpeople.com or www.mypyramidtracker.gov.  You should start walking anyways!  You'll lose weight and feel great!<br>  <br>  Plus, you can't target losing weight in a specific spot.  Your body decides how you lose weight and nothing you can do (aside from liposuction) can decide where the fat comes off from.  You'll lose weight all over, which will also take fat from your stomach.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BIFO1Vudaa	depends how much you have<br>  it is good for trimming down your stomach, but it depends how far you're walking and how you're eating.

BRDqfAy3aa	everything about orgasm - read below|`|OwQsCR4Saa	You'll know when you experience it.  It is not something you have and then wonder "was that an orgasm?" you know what it is.  Normally, your boyfriend is not the first one to give you an orgasm.  You will first do it yourself and then you'll need to enlighten your man.|`|afSqgYBZaa	Believe me; when you have an orgasm, YOU WILL KNOW. It is the best feeling ever, washing over your entire body and you won't want it to end!! <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there some women who never have and/or never will experience that feeling. I'm sure that you are not one of those people, all you have to do is experiment a little bit with yourself, perhaps with a toy, and just fool around to see what you like. That way, you can tell your partner where to find the light switch instead of looking for it in the dark, if you know what I mean. Lol<br>  <br>  As for how to make him last longer, that will happen eventually. Depending on age, he might so excited and aroused all at the same time; as he gets accustomed to you and you begin experimenting, he will eventually learn how to regulate that on his own.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|h5xSfcT6aa	you will know - its a feeling you ve never had before, but its very pleasurable. you will definitely know what it is.<br>  there is no time scale of how long it will take - it more how you do it, than how long you do it for.<br>  x|`|c8lBbWtQaa	You will know. trust me.

q97qBMOjaa	It is just my own theory, but if you think about it, it makes sense. The sound of the pee hitting the toilet, especially at the end when it drips out, sounds like the dripping of water out of the faucet. So, in my own little theory, I think it alerts your subconscious since the sound is so similar. Your brain literally reacts to the sound making you feel like you need to go.|`|8a02109a7c6dc5658de4608dfebad376aa	i know its weird...brb got to pee.....|`|H51UD0vlaa	i hear you, or really cold water out the tap|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	It's association. Have you heard of Pavlov's dogs? It's a bit like that.<br>  You hear the water dripping, you associate that sound with peeing, your body responds by physiologically setting you up to pee.
qLljqIBTaa	The easiest way to determine portion size for meat is typically the palm of your hand. You will want to eat lean healthy meat like chicken and turkey. You can't really overeat on vegetables. Some fruits, like bananas, you will want to eat in moderation. I wish I knew you weight and height and I'd be able to give you a better idea. Oh, limit carbs to two servings a day and try to eat them earlier in the day and focus protein rich foods toward the end of the day. Remember that 1G fat =9 calories 1 g carb=4 cal 1 gram protein is =4 cal . The diet people say to eat 5 healhy meals a day ever 2 1/2-3 hours apart. exercise etc...<br>  <br>  Breakfast=oatmeal egg <br>                     egg white omelot with salsa<br>  <br>  snack= carrots, celery, apple, (i like a small bag of baby carrots)<br>  <br>  lunch= lean cusine, health choice  microwaveable lunch<br>  <br>  snack= cottage cheese and pineapple<br>  <br>  dinner= chicken breast (no skin)  with green beans etc (hundreds of helathy chicken recipes online)<br>  <br>  8+ glasses of water throughout the day<br>  This is just an idea....play with it.  good luck|`|GTza6W4raa	Without knowing your weight or anything, this question is very difficult to answer. Do you have any health problems? Are you obese? If so you'd be best talking to your doctor.<br>  <br>  You have to eat healthily for more than a week...you should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and no junk food. Fresh lean meat and some dairy products like cheese can also be good for you. In terms of fruits and vegetables, I recommend spinach, carrots, broccoli, avocado, apples, tomatoes, kiwifruit and blueberries. <br>  <br>  Portion sizes...again this is hard to answer...basically a small plate, don't eat once you're full, and eating several small meals a day is probably better than three big ones.
zQohPPH9aa	Breast feeding is the best thing you can do to lose weight right now.<br>  This is the main reason women that don't breast feed cannot lose weight easily.  <br>  <br>  As long as you have enough body fat, don't worry about not having enough calories to produce breast milk.  Alot of breast milk is made by breaking down your extra fat tissue.  Make sure the calories you do eat are not junk food.  <br>  <br>  Also, eat 4 or 5 meals a day instead of 3 meals.  For example, never eat more than 300 calories at one meal.  This will give you a total of 1200 - 1500 calories per day.  Weight loss is more about portion size and eating often than anything else.<br>  <br>  Also, eat fresh fruit and vegetables instead of processed/canned foods.<br>  Try not cooking the fruits and vegetables.  They are much better for you RAW.|`|ntcETBTQaa	Breastfeeding alone should help you lose weight..just stick to the fruit and veggies and protein concept no fried foods

Qlmk0cOZaa	First I just want to say don't trust any body mass index (BMI) chart. Body fat is different in every person. 240-255 isn't bad for a person over 6' as long as it's mostly muscle. If he works out a lot or is very active then i would say don't worry about it. But if he sits and eats potato chips all day...well yeah losing a bit would be good. If he really wants to know tell him to get tested to see how much body fat he has and look up how much body fat is healthy/normal for someone his height/weight/age.|`|kbnLb4Vgaa	Yeah it's fat unless you're one massive bodybuilder.|`|r2aMQARoaa	you're the same dude who was hating on your cuzin for having game! 250 aint that bad for a 6'2". if its muscle then its good. if not then losing maybe 20 lbs wont hurt.

RUfHp0Lmaa	Innanzitutto questo è il posto adatto.<br>  Riguardo al tumore, saranno gli oncologi che seguiranno tuo nonno a decidere che cura attuare. Molto probabilmente ci saranno diversi cicli di chemioterapia, cioè iniezione in vena di farmaci che distruggono le cellule tumorali. Dato che (credo) si trova in un età avanzata, la chemio non basterà, e allora dovranno fargli fare anche cicli di radioterapia, che consiste nell' utilizzare delle radiazioni allo scopo di distruggere le cellule tumorali. Non credo che opteranno per l' asportazione chirurgica, ma tutto è possibile, comunque vedranno dopo le cure. Innanzitutto bisognerebbe vedere se il tumore primitivo (quello al polmone) è benigno o maligno, mi auguro il primo caso, e allora le preoccupazioni sarebbero minori, perchè il rischio di perdere la vita è inferiore.<br>  Le metastasi sono dei piccoli frammenti di cellule malate che si staccano da un tumore e che raggiungono altre parti del corpo con la circolazione linfatica e del sangue. Sono molto pericolose, perchè possono far nascere altri tumori. Se le metastasi hanno già dato complicanze in altre sedi, saranno quasi sicuramente asportate.<br>  Infine, ti dico di non preoccuparti, perchè i medici sanno fare il loro lavoro e aiuteranno tuo nonno ad uscire da questa brutta situazione.

Tul28v42aa	There are approximately 3500 calories in a pound of fat.  Of course, just exercising until you put up that number on an exercise machine does not necessarily translate directly into a pound of fat lost.  Exercise in the morning, it will boost your metabolism throughout the day.  Wait an hour to eat after you have exercised.  Diet is important, it isn't just how many calories you eat, but what type and when.  Eat healthy foods in six small meals per day coming to roughly 1500 calories per day.  <br>  <br>  Also, weight training is great for burning fat as it takes calories to lift weights and your body burns calories as it builds up new muscle, not to mention that muscle mass also burns more energy.  If you alternate weight training and cardio, you can work out six times a week without the risk of overtraining.  Finally, give yourself a free day where you work out and eat whatever you want.  Yes, whatever you want.  Two Big Macs for lunch?  Knock yourself out.  This may seem crazy but the free day will send a message to your body that you are receiving plenty of calories in your diet, so there is no reason to go into a fat storing mode the rest of the days you work out.  It will be impossible to ruin your diet completely on your free day unless you are a total glutton and somehow manage to eat tens of thousands of calories on that one day.|`|1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	You know<br>  1 gram of protein = 4 calories<br>  1 gram of carbohydrates = 4 calories<br>  1 gram of fat = 9 calories<br>  1 pound of fat = 454 gram<br>  So 1 pound of fat = 9*454 = 4086 calories|`|AA11896337	There are 3500 calories in a pound of FAT, which is what most people want to lose. But if you only do aerobic exercise and do not strength train, you most likely will burn off MUSCLE also, which is heavier than fat... <br>  <br>  So it's too difficult to accurately know how many calories it will take to lose one pound of both.... It is easier to focus on losing body fat in percentage terms rather than simple weight loss.|`|dqNKUtuEaa	3500 calories = 1 pound<br>  <br>  Exercise is important in weight loss, but is a very small percentage of the equation.  What you eat is at least 75% of the battle.  A 40 minute workout only burns a few hundred calories, so it's nearly impossible (and unwise) to try to burn as many calories as you consume each day.  If you create a 500 calorie deficit each day by eating 250 calories less than usual and burning 250 calories in your workout, then you will lose a pound a week.

KeIcJ7vZaa	well to answer your question in medical lingo... here is how it breaks down. Klonopin (aka clonazepam) has a slower onset, which reduces the ammount of euphoric rush you get. To make up for this, it has a very.. very.. long half-life, which causes less need to take more of the medication. Klonopin is used as a chronic anxiety benzodiazapine.<br>  <br>  Xanax on the other hand, is used on an as needed basis, gives a very strong euphoric rush, but has a very.. very.. short half life.<br>  <br>  If you were put on klonopin, your Dr. is probably trying to help you avoid the horrors of xanax. If you switched, you would be popping xanax like crazy since you have no long term benzodiazapine in your system anymore.<br>  <br>  NOW, if you have sudden, out of the ordinary panic attacks... a small dose of xanax could be useful and you should talk to your doctor about this.|`|h3NJO9dWaa	I found I was still tired after switching to xanax and became horribly addicted to them because they are stronger

AA12054958	An excellent question. This is far more complicated than you might imagine. Since the detailed answer below got kind of long, I will summarize the main points up front. About 25% of people do actually sneeze when exposed to bright lights like the sun. We do not know exactly why this happens, but it might reflect a "crossing" of pathways in the brain, between the normal reflex of the eye in response to light and the sneezing reflex. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug97/865380242.Me.r.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug...</a>|`|qiX0BZLlaa	lol... Great question.. I was going to ask same question... I have my friend who is used to sneeze when facing bright light! I always find it weird when he sneezes! He even told me that sometimes, if he wanted to sneeze at night whild in bed, he turn on his cellphone's lcd screen and place it directly in front of his eyes so it would make him sneeze!<br>  Personaly, I think it is related to the photons (light molecules), which are displaced through the air waves and penetrates into the person's nose canals which stimulates the sneezing process!

FrlcWi6taa	Well, you actually already have toned abs!  What you really require is a little more development on your abs and to lose some fat covering the area.  First thing you need to do is change your diet so you are eating less fat with more protein and a good balance of carbohydrates, especially fibrous carbohydrates (green leafy vegetables etc.).  The diet will actually help you achieve your results much more than the exercises!  I equate the results at 80% from your diet alone...  Next step is doing crunches, not sit ups, as sit ups are more effective for your hip flexor muscles than your abs.  General fitness should include some walking or light running for at least 30-45 minutes per day, 5 or 6 days a week, but start slowly if you are not very fit.  Perhaps even consult a doctor to make sure you are in good shape and a doctor may suggest other activities specific to you.  I hope this has helped! :)|`|sZd77pe9aa	A simple exercise that you can do wothout problem & get result in 30 days. This is called foot elevation exercise. Lie on your back on a bed, hand should be by your sides & close, legs shoud be stretched & straight. Don't keep pillow under your neck or head. Now raise both legs up together by 18 inches & hold it their for as much time you can, knee should not bend. When it seems impossible to hold your leg up, put it down, take rest for 2 mins & start again & again untill you get exhausted. It seems easy but when you do it you will know that how difficult it is & how much strain you feel on your abdominal muscles. You can do it as many times you wish but from till 45 mins after meal you are not supposed to do the exercise. Don't discard without giving it a single try.|`|65f96a3f83910747fd7abf05cccb8ef1aa	It is very difficult to set a time limit on how long it will take as everyone starts from a different point and it also depends on how much effort you are willing to put in. However there are some basic rules to understand to get toned abs. Firstly the excess body fat that sits on top of the muscle needs to be reduced through healthy eating and a good all over body workout including cardiovascular work like running, cycling and swimming. Secondly you need to work the abs as a whole as there are a few stomach muscles to take into consideration. I have written a blog and the latest subject is a collection of stomach exercises with videos to show you exactly how to do them, check them out on the link below. I hope this helps. Good luck
DnX8vpZVaa	It'll all even out if you spend more time in the sun, this is no time to become a hermit. I recommend to continue to apply aloe vera everyday until your skin stops peeling. And DO NOT under any circumstances go outside without sunscreen! If you burn another layer of skin it will hurt twice as bad. Even if you have the strongest urge to do not pick at the peeling skin it'll be done peeling soon enough and eventually the rest of your skin will fade to that color or your new layer of skin will darken enough to match!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4FDvEjfAaa	Don't worry too much about that... as a frequent sun burn victim i can almost guarantee you that it will go back to normal eventually.

7n3FTjCRaa	Its good you realized that excessive belly fat has risks for your health and especially for your heart. My advice is to stop asking around and getting answers from non professionals. You should first consult with a certified trainer professional or nutritionist. In my case, as I had also a huge waist line, what worked for me was a total-fitness program which included both proper training and proper diet and nutrition. I have found this program at the link below:|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Ignore the spam.<br>  You cannot target your fat-loss except with surgery. Your body has a favorite place to keep its fat. For a lot of us, that's the belly. Wherever your body's "chosen" spot is, that will be the last "clinging-on" fat after you're skinny everywhere else.<br>  You can reduce the flabby appearance with toning but that isn't your goal.|`|947a0dc92dd1bc409cf80a04f33e48e0aa	I am well read on this topic. Follow this advice and you will lose weight in your gut.<br>  1.Drink at least 16oz of cold water as soon as you wake up each morning, and try to drink a gallon of water each day.<br>  2. Do cardio in the morning before eating breakfast. Try to do at least 15-20 minutes of high intensity interval training (HIIT training) - look that one up on the net for details. Do cardio up to 5 times per week.<br>  3. Weight train - 30-40 minutes/ 3 days per week. Do total body workout with compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench press, etc. There are lots of good books out there on this <br>  4. Don't eat any carbs, sugar or alcohol for a month. Eat only protein, healthy fats and veggies (except carrots and corn because they have lots of sugar).<br>  5. Take CLA -conjugated linoleic acid<br>  <br>  All this stuff helps you boost your metabolism.<br>  <br>  I lost an inch in my gut in a month and I wasn't overweight at all. You may have a dramatic change if you are more overweight. Plus, going carb free will give u lots of energy because your body will be using fat as its fuel rather than incoming carbs. Fat is a very good fuel source.<br>  <br>  For the definitive source for the nutrition and exercise part, and a must read if you are serious about getting healthy and losing weight is The Men's Health TNT Diet <br>  <br>  Check w/ your doctor before doing any of this<br>  <br>  Get the book from the library or go buy it...it's worth every penny<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/cda/article.do?site=MensHealth&channel=weight.loss&category=transform.2007&conitem=671b1d8690fd2110VgnVCM20000012281eac____" rel="nofollow">http://www.menshealth.com/cda/article.do...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mens-Health-TNT-Diet-Explosive/dp/1594866597/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207858647&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Mens-Health-TNT-Di...</a>
rCYIWvwraa	Trust me.  It's a common issue with a lot of people who excercise on a daily basis.  I myself, have had this issue in the past.  Try using a inflatable back ring or back pad while doing your sit-ups.  What I do for a nice six pack of abs are knee lifts.  Or knee raises.  You do this by clinging on a excercise bar, or pull up bar, and raise both legs straight up so that the top of your knees reaches your chest area.  Three(3) sets of this daily (15-20 repetitions for each set), will not only bring you a rock hard mid section, it will also give you a lean mid section and most importantly, strengthen and properly align your spinal column. You will also increase your grip in your hands (great for wrestling or jujitsu), and strengthen your wrists (for gymnasts).  You could also work your abdominal section by doing knee raises (one leg at a time) in the pushup position.  Go into the pushup position.  Then slowly and in control, bring your knee towards the front of your body.  I like to rock climb as well.  Or climbing trees.  All of which, keeps your back in proper alignment, while stretching your spinal column at the same time.  Always remember to stretch thoroughly before and after each workout to avoid injury and muscle stiffness.  Good luck and enjoy your workouts.  FFL (Fit For Life) is my life's motto.  Jian G.|`|o7NQufdTaa	Hard floors hurt my spine too, that may just be the cause. But if you're going to be doing sit ups to increase abdominal strength you need to do exercises to increase the strength of your back as well. If you don't your abdominal muscles begin to overpower your back muscles and it can cause back pain/strain.

o8Xfn2bfaa	Decortication is a medical procedure involving the removal of part or all of the outer surface layer, membrane, or fibrous cover of an organ such as the lung, kidney, or brain. It is most commonly performed on the lungs. There is a cavity between the lung and the chest wall called the pleural space or cavity. Decortication is done to remove the lining of the pleural cavity, called the pleura, when this lining becomes thick and inelastic, restricting lung expansion. It is also done to remove tumors in the pleura. The goals of the operation are to re-expand the lung and fix the problems affecting the pleural space to improve lung function.<br>  <br>  Decortication may be necessary to help patients with pleurisy, empyema, fibrothorax and mesothelioma. Pleurisy is an inflammation of the lining of the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs, which can cause painful respiration and other symptoms. Pleurisy can be generated by a variety of infectious and non-infectious causes|`|6d18126e711f352c62adc9c85e6d27ceaa	Decortication is a medical procedure involving the surgical removal of the surface layer, membrane, or fibrous cover of an organ.

The ones that were placed in the institutions, were given horrible shock treatments (those still exist too), and never got out of their confinement.  So, therefore, there is still a big stigma about the mentally ill, even in our day and time.  Mental health care should be just as important as any health care, but even if you have health insurance, usually you can look on the back of your card and see that mental health care is handled through a completely different network.  I believe some of the problem is, besides the aforementioned, is that people that are mentally ill are just not ready to take a stand due to the fact that they'll be labeled as weird, crazy, etc.  The best thing all of us concerned about this problem is to contact our congressmen, senators, etc., and tell them that this nationwide problem needs the attention it deserves.|`|iiExfNYQaa	mental health issues have only come into the open a short while ago=it used to be that you didn't dare tell anyone a family member had mental problems and some where even put in nursing homes =now it is much better known about and the fact that Drs are acknowledging this is a sickness too, that people with mental problems are actually getting the help they deserve

Sometimes it's a medical condition called erectile dysfunction.  Sometimes it can happen because of worry or stress related to another part of his life.  Sometimes it happens for no apparent reason, especially if he's been maintaining his erection for a long time.  Nervousness or feeling pressured to "perform" sexually can kill an erection quickly.  So can alcohol consumption... and it doesn't always have to be a lot of booze.  In some men, it can take as little as a couple of beers to cause erectile problems.  Certain medications and certain illegal drugs can have the same effect.  It can even be the sudden urge to pee that's killing his erection.<br>  <br>  Either way, don't automatically assume it was because of you.  Most of the time, that's not the case at all.  Be understanding and don't make a big deal out of it if it happens.  Instead, perhaps taking a short break or even reverting to the foreplay phase will allow him to refocus and regain his erection.  Limiting alcohol consumption before sex is a good idea too.  If it becomes a regular ocurrence, perhaps a visit to the doctor is in order.

Now that C HRT is apparently gone, I called them up and they still had my order info, so I ordered a refill. They said I'll have my shipment in 5 business days. So we'll see. But if you want their number, it's 646-278-1048. Warning though... in about a month they'll start calling and calling to see if you need a "refill". Just ignore the calls (really only about 4 or 5 a day) and they'll stop in a couple of days and start again about 2-4 weeks later. Oh and price. I hope you're sitting down. $180 for 30, $220 for 60 and $260 for 90 including shipping (via DHL, adult signature required). And they only take Visa. I got a $10 discount, but I don't know if that's a sale or because it was a refill. They have a web site, but I have no clue what it is anymore. They're supposed to send me a confirmation email, but I haven't received it yet. When I get it, if it has a web site addy, I'll post it. I'm assuming they'll take new orders and not just refills.

The most common is to use a sterile cta (cotton tipped applicator) big Q-tip and insert it into the urethra (the hole you pee out off) about one to one and a half inches. Blood work can also be done and if you have sores they will take samples from that.|`|Kit9y0sNaa	Several types of tests can be used to detect a gonorrhea infection. Most tests use a sample of body fluid from the affected area.<br>  <br>      * Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). NAATs detect and make many copies of the genetic material (DNA) of gonorrhea bacteria. NAATs include polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and transcription mediated amplification (TMA). These tests are very accurate and can be done either on a urine specimen or a sample of body fluid from the potentially infected area.<br>      * Nucleic acid hybridization test (DNA probe test, molecular probe test). Molecular probe testing detects genetic material (DNA) of gonorrhea bacteria. This test is done on the body fluid collected from the potentially infected area, most often the cervix or urethra. Samples collected from the throat do not always provide accurate test results. Often the molecular probe test for gonorrhea also tests for chlamydia, another STD with symptoms similar to those caused by gonorrhea.<br>      * Gonorrhea culture. A gonorrhea culture is done on a sample of body fluid collected from the potentially infected area, such as the cervix, urethra, eye, rectum, or throat. The sample is combined with substances that promote the growth of gonorrhea bacteria. Unlike other gonorrhea tests, a culture can determine if gonorrhea bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics.<br>      * Gram stain. A Gram stain test is done on a sample of fluid from the penis or, less commonly, the cervix. The fluid is spread on a microscope slide and stained with a dye that can help identify gonorrhea bacteria. A Gram stain is less reliable than a culture or molecular probe test for detecting gonorrhea, but it produces faster results. Gram stain testing done on a sample from the cervix is not very accurate.<br>      * Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, EIA). EIA testing is done on a sample of fluid from the penis or cervix. An EIA test detects substances that trigger the immune system to fight the gonorrhea infection (gonorrhea antigens). An EIA test is less accurate for detecting gonorrhea than a gonorrhea culture.|`|a26b747c76e01b98b822771179e14a2caa	he usually does a swab test and thats where he pushes a bud down the inside of the penis to collect some cells just like it would be in a woman - ooh sounds painful doesnt it - WELL IT IS ! so be warned !

bF0Xc0tUaa	Good question. Generally I don't really think working harder would increase the amount of sleep you need. - It may depend more on the routine in your life. Maybe you are working at times when you normally don't and this unbalances something.<br>  <br>  Needing 8 hours of sleep is normal but waking up tired is something you may need to look at. <br>  Go to bed and wake up at regular times.<br>  Do everything to make sure your sleep is as comfortable as possible (temperature/matras/etc).<br>  Think about the possibility that there are issues that may be unresolved-that make it difficult to get-up-and-go.<br>  If you remain tired after sleeping regular hours go see a doctor.|`|ee4ffead2d1cce2db791033456227748aa	This could be several things.<br>  <br>  It could be that you need a blood test, for glandular fever, for example.<br>  <br>  You could be low on iron, which can make you tired; again, you'd need a blood test to be sure.<br>  <br>  It could be that you're stressed, or anxious over something.<br>  <br>  It could even be a sign of eye strain.<br>  <br>  Or an undiagnosed tooth infection.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're not eating healthily; are you eating a lot of junk food? Eat more fruit and veg.<br>  <br>  If you sleep with a very bright light on, switch to a dimmer one, or a totally dark room. This can make a real difference.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to go to the doctor!|`|2Nm2a4Zqaa	I don't know why.

6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	No.  Some people who have taken SSRI's for a long period of time can develop a withdrawal syndrome if they suddenly stop taking them.  What you should do is gradually reduce the dosage over several weeks.  This should help ease or eliminate any withdrawal symptoms.  You should always talk to your doctor before quitting any medication because with some drugs you may need to be tapered off them.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	You should never do this without consulting your doctor first.  Sometimes stopping a drug like this suddenly can cause seizures.|`|89X41WLRaa	You didn't hurt your body or brain by not taking it, but it may not work as well when you go back on it.

But do seek proper advice, so that you can feel better soon.|`|mMugRyp2aa	Not at all, but the doctors do tend to wean you on and off the meds to keep you from having headaches and other side effects.

OxyContin is harsh on both the kidneys and liver and used with caution with patients with either illness. She should not self-medicate while in the hospital if she's taking Tylenol on her own.

rLYdo9r2aa	I really cannot opine on whether TCS recruits people or chucks them out if they find out that you are affected with colour blindness. <br>  <br>  However, i have seen a lot of companies expressly mention it in their requirement list - whether the candidate has to meet certain requirements, or the other way around where they mention that persons affected with colour blindness need not apply. this might be needed in situations where the company is into engineering, aviation or other industries where they need correct vision as a part of their job brief to avoid accidents or confusion at work.<br>  <br>  As a CMM level 3/5 company TCS might have certain obligations to accept candidates with disability or have clear rules regarding the same. please do not speculate, and ask the HR department clearly, and I'm sure they will be glad to help you out. a straight forward approach is the best and it will help you clear any issues.|`|5d1f081bd15e22e46f1adedf8638b5d7aa	No such things.My bro is a bit color blind and is still in TCS.Don't fear.|`|3NaXsz8daa	well thats not a problem at all ........just chill.......all the best

Buttermilk has also been used from long back, as a skin cleanser and as a beauty aid. <br>  <br>  Castor Oil : It should be applied on the spots in the morning and in the evening for at least a month. <br>  <br>  Lemon Juice : Acidity in the lemon juice causes the spots to fade away. <br>  <br>  Onion : One teaspoonful of juice of onion is mixed with two teaspoonful of vinegar and then rubbed onto the age spots at least twice a day, till the spots disappear. <br>  <br>  Apple Cider Vinegar : Two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar are mixed with one teaspoon of orange juice and then applied to the spots and relief is seen within a few days|`|hkmW3Rg8aa	apple cider vinegar is known to be a natural purifier... i haven't heard anything about it fading sunspots. the only natural remedy for sun spots i do know about is lemon juice. just cut a lemon and rub it directly on your skin, and avoid sun exposure.<br>  <br>  p.s. if you do want to try apple cider vinegar, use a cotton ball or q-tip and apply it to a blemish... it will naturally kill the bacteria!!
AA10778838	Okay, you have to be serious about this or it won't work. First, set yourself a calorie limit, like 1000 calories per day. Eat what you want but don't go over that limit. Eat lots of things that are small and don't use up your limit, quickly, so you can nibble. Start an exercise routine. Try the ones on tv. When I eat too much, and the wrong foods, I feel tired and depressed. It isn't worth it. Once you adhere to the calorie count you start feeling so much better, because you are actually doing something that you feel good about, the exercise brings back all those nice curves that you won't be happy without. You have to pick between being ugly and overweight, while eating too much. Or going on the 1000 calorie diet, exercising and looking hot. Food or fun?|`|5caaddf8d4ce7415f166f75457438454aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I am a detox specialist and I specialize in helping people lose weight. The easiest and FASTEST way I know to lose weight is to detox.<br>  <br>  If you would like to lose weight, I can suggest a safer or faster alternative- a detox. I myself have lost 33 pounds within 2 mths doing a detox.<br>  <br>  From your description, i will need you to send me a list of the things you eat everyday...  if your stomach keeps asking you to eat, it is usually because of two reasons:<br>  <br>  - you dun eat enough nutrients that your body needs and therefore your body keeps calling out for more food.<br>  <br>  - you may have a negative mindset towards being fit and shapely UNCONCIOUSLY and this unconcious mindset is asking you to eat and eat and eat!<br>  <br>  A detox is healthy because it brings balance back to your body and losing weight is just a by product of the detox. So at the end of the detox, you will find yourself get more energetic, healthier, more radiant looking as well.<br>  <br>  And the detox is simple. All you need to do is three things.<br>  <br>  Number one, follow the detox programme which requires you to change your diet a little bit. Eg, take more vege and less meat and seafoods.<br>  <br>  Number two, use 1 minute a day to take some natural health foods that I take to enhance the speed and the effect of the detox.<br>  <br>  Number three, drink lots of water to flush the toxins out..<br>  <br>  Also, if you follow my detox, I will provide consultation to get rid of the mindset challenge.<br>  <br>  And that's it.<br>  <br>  The rest is up to you.<br>  <br>  So what do you think? ;)<br>  <br>  If you are keen to find out more about my detox programme, you can email me at verityy@yahoo.com.|`|305jRiOmaa	You had a hysterectomy, are you taking hormones?  That would be the most logical explaination that I could think of for you to be wanting to eat constantly, if your hormones are out of whack.  Try going to a doctor and seeing if that's the problem, or if maybe the hormones you are taking aren't the right kind or dosage for you.  Other than that, maybe try a women's one a day vitamin, that will help make sure your vitamins are in check, and you might not be as hungry as often.  Good luck!|`|D9VqDQBVaa	go see a weight management doctor.They can prescribe u something that'd take away ur desire to eat.<br>  believe me it works wonders!|`|EEBvOp3naa	Great post!

Don't hold back symptoms for fear of sounding like a whiner either. Yeah, it could be hormones but these are also symptoms of depression. Did the hystorectomy have an effect on your psyche? Or is that completely unrelated? How has life been in general since you've noticed your appitite a constant visitor? Although depression certainly is not a charactor flaw, it still is not always an easy thing to admit. Think long and hard, and don't be afraid to be honest with yourself and your doctor. If depression is the problem, there is help for you. Best of luck :)

I am leading toward the idea of pregnant though. Also, if you have been trying to get pregnant, or really want to get pregnant, I have heard of women actually psyching themselves out to "think" they are pregnant. They get symptoms of it and everything. Just check it out again in a couple weeks.

Ci5QDEW5aa	Eat a low GI diet helps a lot. Doing Qigong or Tai Chi is also very helpful as the cysts are congection in the system and this congestion can be cleared and prevented by regular qigong. I know it was so successful for me I now teach it.|`|1bvxIZ8Eaa	I'd suggest that step one is to find a really good, experienced nutritionist, and get proper advice on eating healthily. Include lots of organic fruit and veg in your diet. I also have PCOS and am trying to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to exercise more; nothing excessive, even just walking for 20 minutes a day can help!<br>  <br>  There are various alternative therapies that can also possibly help: homeopathy, and chinese herbs are two I'd suggest.<br>  <br>  If you opt for the chinese herbs, make sure you go to a reputable chain; if you're in the UK, Herbal Inn are fairly good. Only buy the dried herbs that you'll have to take as a drink twice a day - don't be pushed into buying all the capsules and drinks etc!<br>  <br>  You could also go and see a regular herbalist, and see if that helps.<br>  <br>   You're right not to agree to just take the pill: it has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, for one thing.<br>  <br>  If, like me, you have terrible PMS as part of the PCOS, be aware that anti depressants can help enormously with this.|`|4a745032f8567119151ff68f7cb2a38baa	I would check into a local homeopathic or naturopathic doctor. I personally have been on a mission to find out more about this condition, and have been told by a couple doctors I don't suffer from it. Very few women actually have every single symptom on the list (of about 200!). It's very hard for western-trained physicians to diagnose this, and I have symptoms they don't have answers for, they just want to give me birth control pills. I'm not okay with them... so I wish you many blessings along your journey.|`|AAZ6mibxaa	With PCOS, you want to be sure that you do not ingest anything that has a "testosterone" hormone in it, including progesterone, as your  testosterone (progesterone) levels will run high while your estrogen may run at normal levels or a little bit lower than normal.   You don't want to increase estrogen, but balance out the hormone levels so that they are functioning properly. <br>  <br>  The treatment for PCOS via herbs is very very similiar to Endometriosis.   The listed would be for a one month supply, although it may take up to 4 months to get rid of it entirely.  <br>  2 Bottles of Anti-C<br>  1 Bottle of Hers<br>  1 Bottle of Unicorn Root<br>  1 Container of Bentonite Clay<br>  1 Bottle of Dissolve<br>  1 Bottle of Slippery Elm <br>  and a Colon Cleanse.  <br>  <br>  I suffered from Endometriosis for 3 years, before I finally sought help herbally.

Forget fad diets -- dieting boils down to "calories in, calories out."<br>  <br>  Avoid things advertised as "Fat Free" -- they usually make up for it elsewhere in bad stuff.  A moderate amount of regular dietary fat is not a bad thing -- you actually need some fat in your diet.  Believe me, it's NOT automatically going to your hips.  And for both your diet and general health, avoid saturated and trans fats completely.<br>  <br>  Actually, in tandem with the above paragraph, try to avoid processed, pre-packaged foods altogether.  No frozen entrees.  If you want to snack, eat fruit.<br>  <br>  I hope this doesn't count as spam, but I'm having great success on the Nutrisystem plan.

Your body will store toxic acids in the fat cells in order to protect your vital organs from being exposed to the acids.  As long as you continue consuming a lot of acid (sugar, vinegars, alcohol, caffiene, dairy, meat) your body will continue to retain fat as a means to have a place to store the acids.  Your goal is extremely reasonable and very attainable.  If you are serious and committed to acheiving this goal, send me an email and I can send you some more detailed info.
c2e5cce91573381ad78399023520bcc2aa	I agree with the first response that running is definitely going to burn more calories than walking for each mile that you put in.  Running is not only covering ground horizontally but requires a little leaping in-between strides which takes more energy to do than walking.<br>  <br>  Now that said I will tell you that walking is a runners best friend.  Taking walking breaks is a great helpful way to get into running.  How I started was to begin by walking then try and run a 1/2 mile then take a 2min walking break and repeat.  Eventually you will be running the whole way through and you will not think anything of it.<br>  <br>  If you're goal is to lose weight remember that you need a calorie deficit.  I have always heard to plan to burn around 100 calories per mile walking or running.  Running will be a little more and walking will be a little less.  <br>  <br>  FYI: A pound of body weight = 3,500 calories<br>  <br>  And please remember to take rest days!  I've had too many friends that were overzealous about starting running and burn out too quickly.  Stay motivated and maintain some sort of goal throughout your running like a certain distance or completing a race.  4 days a week of running is plenty and if you’re training for a race incorporate a longer run on the weekends.  Good Luck!|`|COn5zmdMaa	No, running and walking will not slim you equally.  Running is always going to make you slimmer because it uses more energy and therefore more calories.  You need to find what is comfortable for yourself.  I liked doing 3 miles each day early in the a.m.  I still had to watch what I ate a little, but not nearly so much as I do without running at all.|`|n4ynckYWaa	Walking and running give exactly the same results, but walking the same distance takes longer. You must run 1 mile per day for each inch you want to lose. Be careful - if you walk or run backwards you will gain weight.

No ice cream.  No cookies.  No sugar in your tea or coffee.  No pudding.  Relax, it's not all that bad.  All these things can be had nice and sweet but without sugar.  Go for the diet sugarless things to satisfy your sweet tooth.  And even then, try to curb them or eliminate them altogether.  I think artificial sweeteners are not good for you.  Also, lay off the salty and starchy foods.  Eat single portions of anything--even butter and never ask for seconds.  Eat three meals a day and always eat them at the same time everyday.  If you do this, your body will metabolize what you eat and regulate itself better.  Try to walk at least a half hour everyday.  You don't have to wear special clothes, in fact wear what you'd normally wear when you go shopping.  Leave your wallet and your credit cards at home and go window shopping at your nearby mall.  Today's malls are so huge that you could get an hour's worth of walking and not even realize it.|`|twSyCULDaa	Since I started to work out I was looking for a good weight loss product.

cl9LlJZFaa	I was banded in April 07.  According to a poll I posted on www.lapbandtalk.com 92% of bandsters have no regrets about getting the band.  That's a very high percentage of satisfied customers!  The list of things to know is very long and you should visit with a good bariatric surgeon to discuss all the pros and cons.  Offhand, I cannot think of anything that I regret or that causes me problems except for the pain associated with food getting 'stuck'...which comes from eating too fast, too big of bites and/or not chewing enough.  These are learned behaviours that require practice and I have confidence that in time I will do just fine.  I have lost 20# in 2 months.  Have 50 more to go.  I am exercising 5x/week at the gym.<br>  <br>  There are many upsides, too.

To make physical improvements, you need to work your body harder than usual. This is referred to as the overload principle. As your body becomes more conditioned, you need to increase the frequency, intensity, or time of your workouts in order to continue improving your fitness level<br>  <br>  Choosing an Exercise:<br>  The best exercise is an activity that you enjoy enough to really pursue enthusiastically. <br>  ? Indoor (Facility) Activities: If the treadmill, stairmaster, rowing machine or stationery cycle doesn't excite you, sample some group activities that strike your fancy. Participate in a group cycling class, beat stress with yoga, find balance with martial arts, stay cool with indoor swimming, or kick some you-know-what with boxaerobics.<br>  <br>  1. Change your eating habits (i.e. start eating smaller portions of food) before if you ate a full plate of food try eating 2/3 of a plate instead.<br>  2.  <br>  o Substitute aspartame for sugar<br>  o Try eating 3 or 4 smaller meals during the day rather than 2 large ones<br>  o Eat your main large meal at midday with the other meals much smaller in content<br>  o Don't eat heavy meals late in the evening as the body wont have time to digest it so it ends up stored as fat in your body.<br>  o Balance your meals out during the day so in one day you have a mix of protein, carbohydrate and vitamins<br>  o Drink lots of water during the day and before, during and after exercise, you should drink at least 8 big glasses of water per 24 hours<br>  o Drink alcohol in moderation<br>  o Stop smoking if you smoke or cut down<br>  o Eat more fibre i.e. pulses grains nuts, pasta, brown rice, cereals, fresh fruit<br>  o Eat more vegetables as part of your diet<br>  o Eat less dairy products or choose those with less fat content i.e. cottage cheese<br>  o Try steaming or poaching food instead of frying it, frying adds calories by the bucketful<br>  o Cut down on Red meat and eat more lean or better still chicken and fish instead<br>  o Use low fat oils in cooking i.e. sunflower, corn or Mazola<br>  o Cut down on your salt intake, there are hidden salts even in tinned foods<br>  o Try substituting carrots or fresh fruit instead of biscuits and sweetmeat when you have a craving for something in between meals.<br>  o Drink semi or skimmed milk as opposed to full cream<br>  Simply choose a diet which is low in fat and cholesterol, moderate in sugar and salt and high in fibre but at the same time has a variety of everything thus making it a balanced diet.<br>  <br>  Calculate your BMR!!!!<br>  BMR means Basal Metabolic Rate.It is used to estimate how many calories you should consume.By using a simple formula called the Harris-Benedict principle, you can assess your BMR.<br>  Your BMR is the amount of energy your body needs to function.Then, to lose weight, you'll need to cut calories or burn extra calories and shoot for a level lower than the results you get with this formula. <br>  We use about 60 percent of the calories we consume each day for basic bodily functions such as breathing.Other factors that influence your BMR are height, weight, age and sex.<br>  Step One : Calculate your BMR with the following formula:<br>  ? Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)<br>  ? Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)<br>  Step two : In order to incorporate activity into your daily caloric needs, do the following calculation:<br>  ? If you are sedentary : BMR x 1.2<br>  ? If you are lightly active: BMR x 1.375 <br>  ? If you are moderately active (You exercise most days a week.): BMR x 1.55 <br>  ? If you are very active (You exercise daily.): BMR x 1.725 <br>  ? If you are extra active (You do hard labor or are in athletic training.): BMR x 1.9<br>  Create a Calorie Deficit:<br>  In order to lose weight, you must create a calorie deficit. It is easier and healthier to cut back your calorie intake a little bit at a time.<br>  Every 3,500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound. <br>  If you cut back 500 calories a day, you will lose 1 pound per week.<br>  If you exercise to burn off 500 calories a day you will also lose 1 pound per week.<br>  Ideally, you should do a combination of both, (e.g. cut back 250 calories; burn an extra 250 calories).<br>  <br>  <br>  For more useful information go to <br>  read the following articles|`|AA11727273	except for losing water weight and possibly a pound or two of fat.....you can't<br>  <br>  all of a sudden eating right and getting plenty of exercise was probably good advice all along|`|e24869809705d10114e329e649ff61deaa	yes, you can, you need to discipline yourself.<br>  <br>  the secret is....when you want something bad enough, you will do it no matter how hard it is. ;)

But unfornately you can not target weight loss in any one area of your body, only  help the body to lose fat overall. The body takes it where it takes it.<br>  Cadio work and a lot of sweat, plus change habits like walking stairs instead of the elevator.  I personally do not believe in changing what you eat...because unless you want to live that way for the rest of your life, the weight will return.  But increaseing overall output, will do it.  It is slower, but real and your body will not go into starvation mode.  Does that mean skipping desert..probably.  Weight loss is not the solution it is a result of how you move.|`|ca156ac05441537d3121c54379cb4aceaa	running, jogging, jumping jack, tread mill, stairmaster, rockclimbing, and so on.<br>  <br>  <br>  eat 1200 calorie meal per day. what you eat can have an influence in where that fat accumulates.|`|4Qv8pOfzaa	exersise even my dog can figure that out|`|KDktqTsZaa	lipo!...well, it's true...<br>  or, ride a bike, or tricycle or even a unicycle.<br>  Any of those will burn some fat.|`|VeOCeutUaa	there are a lot of ways depending the type of thighs you have. wrapsw are safe and a sure way to reduce the fat. operations to remove extra fat is another but let that be the last alternative.take long walks and have some good exersize|`|YzOsBKdBaa	Hell, just go jogging. And maybe squeeze your ********* and thighs together a lot. What do you think a Thighmaster makes you do?

buUzO2oiaa	in 3 months with a good workout program and healthy diet  you can see pretty good results.. if you want to tone  do alot of high rep lifts with lighter weights, if bulking up is what you want  few reps at heavy weights   you could see a change in body fat  up to a 3-4% decrease (approx 1% per month) and if you try hard enough an increase of 1-2 inches in your arms, wait will vary depends on your structure and where you store your bofy fat   you will get results  IF YOU STICK WITH IT!!!....

They can come in a little early but not usually 2 years early.  If you have concerns, check with your dentist.|`|uyOf0yosaa	no only 6 and 12(the ages when they come around) sometimes molars to come early though...shouldnt be a problem|`|JHvjDlEXaa	Molars coming in at 10 years is within normal.

JtDcmqDHaa	well you should add a lot of cardio in you diet, lean meats, no junkfood. Jogging daily for 30-45 minutes is really good, jump rope for 10 minutes a day, you can burn up to 1,000 calories. Strenght training, pick up free hand weights also known as dumbells. Do many crunches daily maybe 200 through out the day is fine as a beginner. Drink water and eat really healthy to really see a great difference faster.|`|0b267f73dd2fd1c54fd706b46e92cc01aa	slimstyle shake its soo gooood ive tryed it u can get it at a health store<br>  <br>  i hop it helps|`|C3jCYXCXaa	don't diet because u dont need to lose weight you jst need lean muscle. run every day and stop eating foods high in fat and sugar|`|Z4f3dbpxaa	Try working out with weights and basic exercise will firm you up. consult your doctor to set you up on a plan with a trainer.|`|IhvbAor0aa	You need to cut out the sugary fats..  like candy.

No lies, just how it is, and how exactly you feel,your girlfriend, can help you by being positive, understanding, and taking you out of the house (Everyday!!)  You need to get out of the house.. It's not helping you be inside, alone, and listening to sad  music, or lying on the bed, NOOO, don't do that... Go for a walk, go to the park, get a puppy or dog, so some kind of pet, that needs your attention, you need to keep yourself busy.. Play football, or any fav. sport u, may like.  Call your bodies, if you feel more comftable talking to them,bcoz, they are "Guys" then tell them.. And it helps to cry.. Remember this, just bcoz, you cry, dosen't make you any less of a guy..

Don't ask her to fix something she can't.  so tell her all about how you are feeling so she can understand what you are feeling.  She can help you get through the tough times by being there for you but don't put too much pressure on her and rely on her to fix it.|`|f9064b19f94f0777952ef2eecf97ac8aaa	Use it to make her have sex with you|`|8d17cb33eb31f99dad67a1d61eeee206aa	no wonder your depressed coming on to a site like this which is full of geeks asking for some heavy mental health advice, your G/F will know as youve probably been a miserable sod, most depressives are attention seeking sado's who need nothing more than a good kick in the ****.

rjcV64D2aa	Before I give this to you, just make sure you are eating good and not eating foods high in sodium, cholesterol, and saturated fats. Eat a lot or protein for the muscle (80+ grams) and a lot of carbs for your energy source. Having no carbs in your system means any protein will be used as energy rather than for muscle. After each workout, down a protein shake. <br>  <br>  I also suggest you buy a second dumbbell of equal weight. Having two will be a lot easier than just one.<br>  <br>  Monday:<br>  Do 20 sets of as many pushups as you can do.<br>  <br>  Tuesday:<br>  Do 4 sets of as many squats as you can do with your dumbbell. Also go out and run this day after the squatting for 35-45 minutes. This will be your leg workout day.<br>  <br>  Wednesday:<br>  Workout the chest, shoulders and back, do Dumbbell flies, dumbbell bench press, side lateral, one-arm dumbbell row and rear deltoid fly.<br>  <br>  Thursday:<br>  Repeat Tuesdays leg workout of squatting and running.<br>  <br>  Friday:<br>  10 sets of as many pullups as you can do.<br>  <br>  If you need descriptions of why I chose this for you or of any of those exercises, e-mail me.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8lwvDDehaa	There are many different options of physical activity that may help you but here are just some suggestions...<br>  1: running up a hill non stop 15 minutes per day can believe it or not develop a 6 six<br>  2: riding a bicycle tones legs<br>  3: playing a active sport once a week such as tennis builds biceps.<br>  4: swimming will also help build and tone arms<br>  5: and you can also try yoga or try make your own fitness program such as 10 push-ups, 15 sit-ups, 5 squats etc. <br>  hope this helps...and keep a log book so you can look at what you've achieved! :) good luck|`|eCnAgdwmaa	Try 30 minuets of cardio each day and work out your arms every other day!|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Eat only when hungry and not more than thrice a day.

leYkWDj7aa	Hola<br>  <br>  Ni?a, me dirias cual es tu edad, suenas como un fantasma q ha vivido toda la vida de cementerio en cementerio, disculpa la comparacion, pero es asi como te leo. Ok primero todos de una manera u otra nos deprimimos, solo q algunos saben superarlo y otros se quedan ahi. Lo primero q debes de ver es q si tu no haces nada por ti nadie lo hara. Si tu todo lo ves malo, creeme q sera malo, dicen q todo lo q tu declaras eso sera, ejemplo si tu dices: ¨hoy sera el peor dia de mi vida¨, cree y jura q asi sera, por q lo has declarado. La mente es poderosa, hace muchas veces lo q deseamos, y te dire algo antes de q lo pienses, yo soy paciente de depresion y antes tomaba medicamentos y creeme q me deprimia q no deseaba hacer nada por dias y dias, pero sabes q un dia me dije no, mi vida es corta, no se si viva 100 a?os o 1 dia, asi q hay q tratar de ver la vida de otra forma y asi lo hize, no te niego q a veces caigo, por q soy humano, pero hago de todo para reponerme y seguir mi camino. No es facil, pero amor nada es facil en esta vida. Luchar es lo q  tenemos todos, y dime algo, por q tu depresion, vives sola, estas enferma, te falta algun miembro o padeces de algo cronico????, de ser o no eso, tu solo ve atras y veras q hay personas q no estan nada bien y le sonrien a la vida, si ya se diras palabras, palabras, pero te repito la mente es muy poderosa y todo lo q digas eso se hara, tu practica y ya veras q poco a poco lo logras, es solo cuestion de comenzar. Te deseo mucha, pero mucha suerte y victoria.|`|7f0c236244ff79aaa02a19d29e182d75aa	hola te cuento que muchas veces la depresion se debe a falta de nutrientes te recomiendo que tomes estos productos que son excelentes www.versebien.com/clau<br>  suerte clau|`|8c668bb9b4be4a931383d4e4c3189607aa	No se que edad tengas pero esto es muy comun en la etapa de los 15 a 20 a?os, probablemente lo que tienes es INDESICION acude con un psicologo para que te ayude.|`|N9Zl9wnTaa	hola pamela, se muy bien de lo que hablas yo he vivido la mayor parte de mi vida sumida en una gran depresion por infinidad de cosas que me han pasado a lo largo de mi vida, pero llegue a tocar fondo y ya no sabia que hacer con mi vida todo esto me genero aparte de la depresion una enfermedad llamada ansiedad que i a mi peor enemigo se lo deseo, pero al fin estoy saliendo y sabes como acudi con un psiquiatra la gente le tiene miedo al psiquiatra piensa q solo los locos van con ellos pero es mentira, yo gracias a mi consulta mi vida esta cambiando no te voy a negar q me esta mediacando pero prefiero estar medicada y poder estar feliz que estar como estaba, yo te diria q acuidieras primeramene con un psicologo y el mimo te orientara a que vallas o no con un psiquiatra dependiendo de tu problema, muchos de los que aqui escriben solo ponen relajate lee cosas positivas pero cuando uno esta sumido en la depresion no te dan ganas de hacer nada yo lo se por q lo he vivido asi que por favor quierete mucho y asiste al medico poco a poco vas a verle el sentido a la vida, los medicamentos no son para siempre, cada quien tiene su historia y a cada uno nos afecta de diferente manera asi que manos a la obra y acude al medico suerte!! yo te comprendo por que estoy en la misma frecuencia q tu cuidate|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Si la verdad yo pase un periodo similar, eso es algo que a veces no deseamos, te recomiendo que tomes muchas vitaminas eso eso es lo mejor para ayudarte a recuperar fuerzas,por que lo primero que uno pierde cuando entra en depresión son las defensas del cuerpo.<br>  Así tomando vitaminas agarras energía y tu depresión poco a poco va disminuyendo hasta que desaparece, suerte.

What happens is that the sweat reacts with the bacteria on the skin to cause an odor.<br>  <br>  Make sure your daughter bathes everyday and understands that she needs to use soap and water under her arms and in her crotch area.  I would buy her some unscented antiperspirant and show her how to use it.<br>  <br>  You are right, she is possibly going into puberty.  It's unfortunate that the largest purchaser of beef in the world, McDonald's Corporation, encourages the use of steroids in cattle to accelerate the maturation process which unfortunately does the same thing to the people who eat the meat.

And read nutrition labels because carbs are hidden in almost everything and serving sizes on labels can be really small.|`|HlreKsEBaa	ok since i am generally a nice person, i am gonna try and help you, and since these a$$ holes dont know how you feel, b/c i want to lose 13lb's, and i am working on that now. i have tried running and other exercises such as... crunches, sit ups, push ups and any other lame exercise their is, but i have found out that if you eat somehtign that tastes good it is bad for you but if it tastes like a fcking cracker its gonna obviously be good for you sinc ethere isnt any tolerably ok tasting foods out there that are good for you. lol but i have ask around, alot, and found that green tea will be your best bet. just drink alot of water and alot of green tea, like 4, 16oz bottles of water and liek 4, 16oz bottles of green tea a day, and then just do like 20 minutes of cardio which would be jogging, running, biking, or if you live ina bad neighborhood and dont lie to go outside away frm your house or donty have a treadmill, do liek jumping jacks or jog in place, ect, anything that gets your heart rate up and keeps it at a steady pace and this is the worst part about exercising i knwo it sucks but that is the only way your gonna burn calories. then do crunches/ sit ups,  squats, push ups, and any other exercise for any other parts of your body you want to define that i didnt list. and just eat like sun chips, they are great for you, basically that is anything whole grain. that will be the best thing for you. it is he main food group your body needs. and just dont eat alot. eat like 5 times a day, but eat very little just enought o where you are not stomach growling hungry. afetr the first two days of eating like this you will get used to it and not feel hungry anymore. eat only chicken- grilled. or grilled fish no other meats. b/c beef stays in your body for 3 days and it is not good for you. eat nuts and raw fruits and veggies. this is the best you can do. you should lose the weight in like 3 weeks if you stick to this. im me if you want to chat but i have aol instant messanger and yahoo so which ever you like better or have.    my yahoo id is      BreannaDDuncan            and my aim id is         BreAnnA DuNcaN     well good luck and i will look forward to getting that im!<br>  <br>  <br>  and FCK that guy sash2022 or whatever his name is for calling you human waiste, his pick looks like he is the waiste b/c he looks like a homeless douch bag! maintane that mane man! you fcking hippie!|`|c63170c8c4e5e5cd700ce17c1bfc1a34aa	The main healthy way is to eating right and exercise more pills do not work without exercise and eating right if you read the fine print it always tells you that the weight is lost along with exercise and a healthy diet. i would just do at home exercises like sit ups and dips could probably work. I wish i could help more but i would really suggest a good cardio work out i lost about 7 pounds in three days by just eating right and running for about a half hour a day but i am sure the same could be achieved by walking  and eating right. I suggest eating veggies because you can usually eat as many as you want without a problem as long as you don't use ranch.<br>  <br>  By the way wasn't trying to lose the weight just happened i am 6 foot 160 so i didnt expect it|`|5LqEu3Qgaa	Dont eat anything but veggies and walk for an hour a day..no sweets or anything..Only drink water.

The more healthy food you eat doesn't give you many calories and even gives you more energy to work out. Try salad, yogurt, and fresh fruit after every meal, eggs, omelets, milk, cheese, ect. Avoid things like cereal and ramen.<br>  <br>  Then just avoid junk food, they are a hazard to your health and weight. Doing push-ups and sit-ups are really simple and help immensely. You'll have a toned body within a few weeks if you do them daily.|`|qBw307Z4aa	Broil your meats ( I recommend eating only salmon and chicken breast) for a month during dinner. Drink water all day and change from regular milk to Lowfat.. actually lowfat everything. Eat a small meal every two hours.. why? cause this speeds up your metabolism over eating heavily 3 times a day. Also as a note make sure to drink COLD water (distilled water preferably) which also boosts up your metabolism.<br>  You don't have to do heavy exercise for this.. walk 20 minutes.. well just walk more  rather than drive everywhere. The first week and a half you'll loose about 7lbs-10lbs. I've lost already 12lbs in a week and a half... only because I'm very active with work.. in the military.<br>  Good luck! I'd like to hear how this is working out for ya :)|`|o6HB29o8aa	there is no possible way to lose 10 pounds in a week, losing weight takes time and patience if you want to keep it off. theres no quick fix! the best thing I can offer is to burn off more calories then you take in, watch the amount of carbs and bad fats that you take in. <br>  <br>  possible excercises could be anything from bikeriding to buying a workout DVD <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck :)|`|c3vWKdKyaa	Cut off your hand and some of your arm.

Then keep the interest on to maintain the weight at that point.|`|5b11c48fe6f23170c851de9f46dd3d42aa	i do yoga every morning for about half hour, lift weights on mon-weds-fri (or swim laps) for about 30 minutes, on tue-thurs-sat i either run or use the ellipitcal for 45-60 minutes.  once you get in the habit it's easy to keep up with.  i always try to do it the same time everyday (5:30 am) *yawn* so that nothing gets in the way

GGxr4K0Naa	Definition of Boil<br>  <br>  Boil: A skin abscess, a collection of pus localized deep in the skin. A boil usually starts as a reddened, tender area and in time becomes firm and hard. Eventually, the center of the abscess softens and becomes filled with white blood cells that the body sends to fight the infection. This collection of white cells is the pus. <br>  <br>  There are several different types of boils. Among them are the following: <br>  <br>  Furuncle or carbuncle: An abscess in the skin caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. It can have one or more openings onto the skin and may be associated with fever and chills. <br>  Cystic acne: A type of abscess formed when oil ducts become clogged and infected. Cystic acne is most common in the teenage years. <br>  Hidradenitis suppurativa: An illness in which there are multiple abscesses that form under the arm pits and in the groin area. These areas are a result of local inflammation of the sweat glands. <br>  Pilonidal cyst: A special kind of abscess that occurs in the crease of the buttocks. These frequently form after long trips that involve sitting.|`|VNTwiEuoaa	a big blister|`|xtqYPtrgaa	As you know there are many pores in our body Thru which the waste materials ore excreted For example sweat glands!!!!

ZGeoXc56aa	Signori è l'ora delle favole della buona notte!<br>  Quando un essere umano cessa di vivere vengono attese le fatidiche 24 ore prima di procedere a qualunque operazione, eccetto in caso di donazione degli organi. L'elettrocardiogramma è piatto, il riflesso corneale è assente, il riflesso neurologico rotuleo o plantare assente, assente il ritmo respiratorio: il soggetto è morto. Non basta! Si esegue un elettroencefalogramma: segnale elettrico corticale assente: il soggetto è morto!!!<br>  Nei films basta che il battito al polso non si senta e... il medico in realtà neppure lo valuta!<br>  Dopo la morte dell'organismo iniziano a "morire" le cellule dei tessuti. Manca l'ossigeno, il glucosio e tutto il resto, il sangue e la linfa non circolano più poichè il cuore è fermo. la mancanza di metabolismo (reazioni biochimiche) determina la riduzione drastica e progressiva della temperatura. Gli enzimi ancora attivi cessano la catalisi. Inizia il rigor mortis e il flusso dei fluidi verso il basso (per gravità). Appaiono le petecchie violacee (livore cadaverico) sulle regioni di cute verso cui fluiscono i liquidi (sangue in particolare), mentre l'altra metà del corpo sbianca (pallore cadaverico).<br>  Dopo alcune ore (variabili a seconda dell'ambiente e in particolare della temperatura) iniziano i processi putrefattivi. Il cervello è il primo a colliquare. Il bulbo oculare tende a sprofondare nell'orbita (come avviene con i pesci del mercato ittico) e l'addome gonfia grazie ai gas prodotti per l'azione dei batteri della flora intestinale. E' un processo gradule quello che porta a morte tutte le cellule dell'organismo, assolutamente irrevertibile, definitivo, inesorabile.<br>  Dr. M.

The following tips can help you stop tossing and turning and achieve a good night’s sleep: <br>  ? Get rhythm. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Sticking to a regular schedule keeps you in sync with your own circadian rhythm, a kind of internal 24-hour body clock that is affected by light and dark. Getting some natural light every afternoon will also help you keep your rhythm and improve your sleep. <br>  ? Exercise regularly and at the right time. Regular exercise can improve the quality of your sleep, but be sure to finish exercising at least three hours before your bedtime. <br>  ? Don’t nap. Napping during the day may keep you awake at night. <br>  ? Watch what you eat and drink. Drinking caffeinated or alcoholic beverages late in the day are likely to keep you awake when you’re ready to sleep. If you like a snack before bed, try a warm drink (without alcohol or caffeine) and a few crackers. Remember that hot chocolate has caffeine, too. <br>  ? Create a safe and comfortable sleeping environment. Your bedroom should be dark, with good ventilation, and as quiet as you can make it. For safety’s sake, make sure you have a good bedside lamp that is easy to reach, a telephone for emergencies, and a working smoke alarm in your bedroom and all through the house. <br>  ? Follow your evening routine. Do the same things every night before you go to sleep. Following a bedtime routine sends a silent signal to your brain and body that it is time to wind down and get ready to sleep. <br>  ? For sleep only. Your bedroom is for sleeping. It’s not a media center, and not a home office. If you’re still awake 15 minutes after you turn out the light, get up and do something that will make you drowsy, then go back to bed and try again. <br>  ? Don’t worry, get sleepy. Try not to let yourself worry or replay your day at bedtime. And don’t worry about not sleeping. Any kind of mental fretting will only make it harder to fall asleep. Play mental games designed to relax your mind, or do something, like reading, that will refocus your thoughts and make drowsy. <br>  ? Get professional help. If your sleeplessness starts to interfere with your ability to function normally, and persists for more than a couple of weeks, schedule an appointment with your doctor or a sleep specialist. <br>  Getting enough sleep is one of the most important things you can do for your mental and physical health—at any age. So sleep well, and sweet dreams|`|V2VIGRQcaa	Think of one thing and focus on it like your favorite color envision the color in you head, what it looks like  and what that color resembles if anything. Don't watch T.V. before bed it will really bother your brain.|`|ifyWfRMsaa	It's purely psychological. You need to tell yourself mentally over and over again that everything is alright. Say "nothing" "nothing" "nothing" over and over. eventually you will fall asleep. This is just from experience, I don't have a degree in psychology. I went to pharmacy school so I can tell you what drugs to take. Benadryl helps with sleep, I use that quite a bit.  take two tablets 20 mins before you want to fall asleep. Let me know if that doesn't do the trick.|`|pl7CRSkraa	I am so the same!I can't wait to see some answers.|`|wnIDxz25aa	Count backwards from 100 and visualize each number in your mind as you do it.

Selbst wenn man bewusst versuchen wollte, die Augen offen zu halten, gel?nge das nicht. Denn Niesen und das gleichzeitige Augenschlie?en ist ein natürlicher k?rperlicher Reflex.

Pero solo las puntitas de tus pesta?as no te vayas a pasar y te las cortes mas de la cuenta por que entonces si tendrás problemas.|`|9a3815e2ed7335e56a75d3ec5438ebe7aa	EDITADO: No te puedo responder al mail porque no tienes activada esa opcion chico, pero bueno, te respondo por aca.. (espero lo leas..)<br>  <br>  Gracias por escribirme chiquillo, no te cortes ningunas puntas vale, pues si lo haces luego te creceran disparejas, creeme que eso es el peor error que puedes cometer pues las pesta?as no son como el cabello que se debe cortar constantemente, el cabello crece irregular, las u?as tambien.. de por si el ser humano es asimetrico, pasa que no lo notamos casi<br>  <br>  Las pesta?as no estan para cortarselas pues es una proteccion de nuestros ojos y si lo haces luego crecen disparejas y quizas se te enrrollen.. tengo una amiga que las tiene enrrolladas jjajaja no veas que feo se ve, bueno..<br>  <br>  Si te digo esto de que crecen disparejas es porque averigue, tambien queria unas pesta?as largas y hermosas.. y en mi busqueda me entere de eso pues tambien me dijeron que me cortara las puntas xD.. yo no me las he cortado jamas en la vida y las tengo largas, ten en cuenta que el aceite de ricino y el peinarlas las estimula, no hace falta la tijera.<br>  <br>  Suerte chico..<br>  <br>  P.D: El rimel no hace crecer las pesta?as.. el rimel es solamente un maquillaje que las hace lucir mejor y mas largas si, se llenan de una pasta.. ya sea transparente o de color que las hace ver mas largas, pero cuando se quita el rimel vuelven a quedar igual, obviamente siempre quedan reciduos aun desmaquillandolas "mal", eso no es bueno, por eso yo nomas con ricino y un lipstick cherry de nivea ajaja.. no soy partidaria del maquillaje xD, pero respeto a quienes lo usan jejeje.. <br>  <br>  saludos!<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  A mi me encantan las pesta?as largas, yo en lo particular use aceite de ricino, es lo mejor.<br>  <br>  Cuando yo me aplique el aceite de ricino lo eche en un envase de rimel transparente, claro, el envase estaba vacio, consigue uno y cuando te lo apliques peinatelas con el mismo cepillo con que lo aplicas.. por arriba y por abajo.. vale, espero que te crezcan hermosas como a mi u.u jejejeje.. un saludo chico..|`|beGghBPmaa	jajajaja... que te ahombres y dejes de pensar en eso broder|`|m5izNQhXaa	ponte aceite de almendras en las noches. veras como te crecen!

oPVGaKwlaa	Heralife is a network marketing type opportunity. You can generate a good income from them, but not if you listen to the company's method of doing business (i.e., bugging all your friends and family). I've been there and done that. Network marketing is a sales job, no matter what anyone tells you.  Learn how to be success at this type of business before deciding to do one. It will save you a whole lot of time and generate income faster. My network marketing business was not growing until I read the 7 Lies of Network Marketing. Now I'm growing. Read this first, then find a company that you want to work with.<br>  <br>  I've downloaded the article to my website <a href="http://www.chrisandpatricia.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrisandpatricia.info/</a> so that you can get it for free.<br>  <br>  Let me know if I can answer any questions.<br>  <br>  Chris<br>  <a href="http://www.chrisandpatricia.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chrisandpatricia.info/</a>|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	Over inflated prices which will drian your wallet!
