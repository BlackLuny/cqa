20090223132904AARZXA9	Education & Reference;Studying Abroad	Stories about student exchange programs?	Right now, I'm a sophomore in high school.  I posted a question about going to India before, and now I'm thinking Spain or a South American (spanish-speaking) country would be more useful.  I would like to go for the duration of my junior year in high school.  One of my life goals is to be fluent in Spanish.  I would like to study medicine in the USA and then practice medicine in a South American country.  I also will study Spanish in college--however I do figure that because of my major, I will not have time to do so during college.      My question is, do you have any stories about going over seas for an exchange program?  (maybe it was you, a family member, a friend, or you were a host family)  I plan to get some more info from my school, but I want some first hand stuff.  Please help me out.

Don't think its too long, my life decision is right here. please read.         i am a sophomore at high school. And i chose to the IB diploma program,which is two years. My ambition is to be a doctor, so i need more science class,which i don't have. So i decided to take out two classes from my junior year schedule and finish them in the summer online, and in those spots i wanted to take some Ap science classes.      My schedule BEFORE taking classes online in  summer :   IB history   IB english   IB math   IB biology   Adv trig  (taking over the summer)   Spanish 3 (taking over the summer)   Spanish 4       (i have to take both Spanish 3    and 4, to take IB Spanish, which    is mandatory for any IB student who    chose spanish as his foreign lang)         My schedule AFTER taking classes:      IB history   IB english   IB math   IB biology   Ap chem    Ap some science   spanish 4       Wondering what my question is, here i really want to take AP science classes, the problem with taking these classes online is, i also have to study for Sat in the summer, my dad thinks sat is more important than these subjects, so he asked me to take just one class besides sat training during the summer. But i wanna do two classes and also sat training (i think i can handle it).but i just wanna ask if this would be too much work in the summer ? or is there any other way to deal with this? any advices and tips are welcome .      best answer will be picked :)

However they said that they do not have this program (even though they have hundreds of programs available).

In which city of Canada their is a good university for that, and another question: Is it possible to move in Italy, and will they recognize my 1 or 2 years of studies here in UofC, if they don't may be is better not to start here...

20090223144426AAXaPsF	Education & Reference;Teaching	In-Paper MLA Citations Issue?	I recently wrote a paper where my in-paper MLA citations had commas in them. For example, if I was citing Gore Vidal page 30 I wrote (Vidal, 30) My teacher said this was incorrect as it should have been (Vidal 30) with no comma after the author's name. After looking it up I found the guidelines and the examples did not have any commas. However, there was no rule stating that commas were incorrect. Because of these commas in all my citations my teacher said the whole thing was wrong and gave me a zero even though it was obvious this was just a small mistake. I feel the zero I received is unjustified and I tried to reason with the instructor but she claimed she was correct and if I was in college the paper would be thrown out (which I think is a load of B.S.). Is there any shred of wiggle room with this comma issue. I haven't yet found any source that explicitly states there should be no comma so I'm hoping I still can prove my point.      Any help would be greatly appreciated. This zero is going to kill my overall grade.    Thanks

My name is Jennifer and I am in college working towards a degree in Elementary Education. I have to interview a teacher and was wondering if someone might be able to help me. Here are the questions I need answered:      1. What are some examples of typical, quick decisions teachers make on a daily basis?      2. What were the 5 most difficult school-related decisions you made this week? What made them difficult?      3. What was the impact of those decisions on the classroom environment? Were the decisions effective?      4. Have you ever made the wrong decision and how did you handle that situation?      5. How much of an impact to the decisions of other teachers affect your daily decisions?      I have to write a 750-1,050 word paper from the answers so details will be great! If anyone is up to it please email me at my personal email address.  My email address is jjkennedy03@sbcglobal.net. If someone could please answer these for me I would greatly appreciate it!

A random idea popped into my head as I was driving home today.  As I passed the affluent neighborhoods that surround my small town, a thought came to my head.  I was thinking that if I was to send letters explaining my situation to these very wealthy people would they help?  Would you?  If you weren't necessarly rich but had a few bucks to spare what would you think of recieveing a letter like mine?  Is it ignorant? is it illegal? would it creep you out to wonder how someone got your address, or would you actually be understanding and sympathetic?  I'm just wondering, because my next quarter is coming up and my student loans leave me owning close to a thousand, so it's not alot, but what would you say? Would you think I was scamming or trying to exploit people of there money? Because I do work,  and I would state that, but I also own a condo that I bought wen I was 21 (big mistake) and I just simply feel like I cannot do it anymore.  I'm 24 and am running out of options.

20090223154536AAKDt50	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	When applying to competative  schools... will a B+ ruin my  chances?	Before I begin, I understand that there are lots of schools out there that will accept me and I am not unhappy with my grades. I am asking about top notch colleges-- schools in the Ivy League and others like Middlebury, Tufts, Duke, UVA, etc.      I have taken the most challenging classes my school offers in every subject including APs and honors courses and at the end of my sophomore year I had an average or an A to an A+. However, in my sophomore year I got a B+ in an high level honors math course and now this year, my junior year, I received a B+ in a Spanish course. I am really worried that these grades have ruined my transcript because I know that these schools routinely turn down applicants with perfect A+ averages and rarely accept students with B+. I have a fairly strong resume-- not amazing-- but I have some leadership roles, TONS of volunteer work, NHS, summer programs, summer volunteering, some other extracurriculars and sports and captain things. But I recognize that this is the norm for an applicant at these universities. Has anyone heard of someone, (and not a minority), getting accepted with a B+ on their resume, or further two of them?

20090223151121AAI2jC3	Education & Reference;Teaching	A student of mine has been acting strangly for the past week?	Alright, I'm an 11th grade History teacher. One of my students, whom I consider to be close with, has been acting oddly for the past week.       I know she lacks confidence (She can barley make it through a presentation without crying) and she's had a difficult time in the past (Depression).      This student used to say "hey!" to me in the halls all of the time (with a happy expression . . . more like "HEYYYYY!!!"). Lately though, it's barley been a smile, and she's been acting like she's hiding something. I confronted her, although there were a few people around, but she said she was alright. But later I noticed she was slouched by her locker ( after school --everyone had left) and I asked again. Her face was red, but she said she was fine.      I can tell there is something wrong, and I'm worried. Is she upset at me? What would you do?

I filled out the FAFSA about two weeks ago and it was processed.  Today, the UCF website said that I had financial aid awards, and showed two Medallion scholarships that I've received.  The problem is, it's impossible that this is the only aid I'm receiving.  My entire family income for last year was only $11,000 and I am expecting no assistance from my parents whatsoever with college expenses.  I reported these things on the FAFSA but it isn't showing any need-based grants, which I definitely do need!      Does financial aid come all at once, or is it still possible that I will receive my need-based grants later?  I applied early and am very, VERY low income so there is no reason why I shouldn't have gotten more than a $2000 scholarship..

In shouting file   The woodmen's carts go by me homeward-wheeled,   Past the thin fading stubbles, half concealed,   Now golden-gray, sowed softly through with snow,   Where the last ploughman follows still his row,   Turning black furrows through the whitening field.   Far off the village lamps begin to gleam,   Fast drives the snow, and no man comes this way;   The hills grow wintry white, and bleak winds moan   About the naked uplands. I alone   Am neither sad, nor shelterless, nor gray,   Wrapped round with thought, content to watch and dream.       Archibald Lampman

20090427001256AAN3Yza	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What is the flaw in the argument? Please explain your choice?	Many people object to the huge rewards paid to a few top people, and feel that there should be some limit on their earnings. But a cut in the highest levels of pay would just create a new, lower band of top earners, and the same argument would then inevitably be used to reduce their income. This downward spiral would continue until everyone was paid little more than the lowest unskilled worker, and no one would then have any motivation to strive for excellence. Educational standards would plummet from lack of incentive. The economy would suffer from lack of skills. The quality of everyone’s life would be poorer. No, any cap on high earnings would do more harm   than good. Which of the following best describes the flaw in the above reasoning?      A It assumes that there are many different levels of pay from the highest to the lowest.   B It assumes that the people who object to the high incomes of a few are those who earn much less themselves.   C It assumes what it sets out to prove: that a cap on earnings would be counter-productive.   D It assumes people’s objection to very large inequalities would necessarily apply to all inequalities.   E It assumes that all the people in the economy are unskilled, uneducated and poor.
