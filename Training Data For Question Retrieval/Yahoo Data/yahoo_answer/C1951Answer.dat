vs3vz6lIaa	well if the wireless doesn't work then you will need to buy a special cord which ranges from 40 - 120 dollars depends on the length so go to the store well radio shack or f.y.e. and ask them and they will give you a cord and if you don't have wireless which you might be confusing with the internet box because they all look the same with small differences and if it isn't a wireless box then you cant get the internet so good luck please pick this as your best answer trust me it works i did it with the x-box 360 and my friend did it with the PS3 so good luck again and this as your best answer|`|JG7W0qvcaa	What Am I The Guy In The Shop    Jezz Phhhssshhh
wqY80VVraa	well what i do is right click on the pic i want and click save picture as in the box then it saves 2 my pictures folder. then i go 2 my pics and when i find the picture i right click on it and click send 2 removable disk f and its on my mp3 player.hope i helped!|`|AA12041546	Make sure the picture(s) is in a format that is compatible with your mp3 player. Check your manual for the mp3 player for this. .JPG is a very common format. If your player can read .jpg but the pic isn't in .jpg format, open it with "MS PAINT" and save as .jpg and then transfer it to mp3 device.|`|lbr2VTy1aa	without knowing the specifics or you mp3 player, i can only assume that it would take common types of image formats like JPEG. every image file you intend to place on the player, right click it and hit properties it should tell you the file type.
lbr2VTy1aa	go into the wii's system settings and go to memory management. the wii does have some built in storage, so unless your sister or mother were playing with the saved files in memory management, you should be good. there you can check to see if the mario kart save data is there. now if only microsoft would put built in storage on their systems...

This might help you some how but search the internet for a more detailed view.  I am pretty sure you have do get an ethernet cable from the Xbox to the Modem/Router.|`|f6bb725c25ef5acdd96c2800627bd6b5aa	you can't. You need a router|`|Yep5Cpwbaa	these people are all wrong! go to youtube and type "how to connect your xbox 360 to xbox live using your laptop" and there are several videos showing step by step ways to set that up...how it helps!|`|IX38UoxNaa	basically, you gotta have a router at the other end for the wireless to connect to. I hope you knew that lol.       from there, go into network and sharing center on control panel, then manage network connections. from there highlight the Local Area connection (the ethernet cable) and the wireless. Then right click and select bridge. this effectively combines your xbox to the wireless without going through a whole lot of messy port forwarding and ICS shizz.

AA12180617	The Best out there , Archos do ones with similar spec (larger memory) and ease of use but they are hard drive based and the size of bricks and just as heavy, the ipod is slim and easy to use one handed.    hey are great, reliable, robust (get a screen protector though from eBay at 1) VERY easy to use and...it is much more than an iPod, its a PDA, its a GPS, its a Games Console, its a Netbook, its a toolkit and many other things.    its reliable easy to use, slim (fits in pocket with no bulge) and long lasting with great screen.    bad points they are not the cheapest players around (but if you take into account the extra bits it works out cheaper than buying all the bits together). and it is limited at the minute to 32GB.|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	In my opinion no. I buy my ipods to listen to music and for that the ipod classic is better. Firstly the Ipod touch's memory is pretty small limiting the amount of music that can be stored on it, secondly it is very expensive and lastly I prefer the simple click wheel of the Ipod classic.|`|X9BuVltFaa	I Love my ipod touch. i have the 8gb and it is awsome. it has all the functions of any ipod or mp3 plus a whole lot more. Ex. Surf the web (with WIFI) and its just like using internet on the computer.download songs right from the itunes store built in on the Ipod(with WIFI) download apps wich are absolutely fun to use whether its a game or utility. most are free too! (WIFI to download apps and some apps require WIFI to use but most do not) the ipod touch design is awsome. The touch screen is unlike anyother ive used before. it also has a built in speaker! comes with nike + ipod built in (just need to buy chip to put in shoe. overall, an ipod touch is like a mini computer(has the same features of a computer) Also has genius if youve heard of that(itunes finds songs like the song youve sleted to use genius on)|`|2VtFVKCDaa	I LOVE mine. I got the 32g for Christmas|`|AFJ07ArNaa	honestly i think they're great    on the second gen, the speakers are quiet but its good if you want to listen to music in class, on the first gen SOME apps don't work but overall it is amazing|`|JAXziu1baa	it is great!!! i got 1 for christmas and i love it. the picture is really clear... practically HD, and you can get 100's of free games off of itunes specially for iPhones and iPod touch's where you can use the touch screen and motion detction.  I bet you'll love it !  Also the wi-fi is great... its just as good as a latop.|`|44PoKKMmaa	i have one and i belive it is worth the money if you are willing to download via mininova or limewire, if you are going to keep paying for songs from itunes then no, but as long as you putting stuff on for free it is good, the aps are great and free and the wifi works really well,, i love mine and am so happy i bought it|`|UmIHzl1Paa	I've had one since about October. It's 2nd Generation, 16 GB. I love it! there are so many apps that you can put on it. I haven't bought any of them (I go for the free ones  =)  It's cool becuse it can pick up wireless internet. I like watching movies on there the most, and playing games.   it can get boring sometimes though, because it's still a music player.
9vOBtO1Oaa	Perhaps your alter ego is doing it, Max!  Just kidding! I had a brand new T.V, which in 8 months simply went off for good. I took it to where I had bought it  and I was told, it had been a re-constructed T.V. except no one ever told me. I'd bought it at a reduction but was not told why. So after it died I had no guarantee to protect my purchase. I hope that is not what happened.  Good luck. and excuse my sarcasm - I am not having a very good time, lately!  Take it back to the place of purchase ESPECIALLY if you know you have a guarantee. They'll have to do d something about it for sure.  I was not so lucky as I explained...I was ignorant not to have asked questions not explained to me in the first place.|`|AA12074512	timer|`|VjkDIvezaa	check your sleep timer  settings|`|YxXBrRq4aa	sounds like it has a sleep timer that is turned on|`|3Mnhvbrwaa	It could be a sleep timer.      Or it could have an overheating problem.  After about 15-20 minutes the TV is heated up.  If it continues getting hotter and hotter, it will trip a warning sensor and the TV will automatically turn off to prevent actual fires.    Check for a sleep timer first.  If that isn't set, you'll have to call in professional help.

It really depends on you. Nobody can say what you'd like as games that i thought i'd like, such as Haze, i absolutely hated.    Just have a look at top rated games and future games that are big names like Resident Evil 5. Not a war game, nor ice hockey, nor does it have a big diesel. Its a good game none the less. Just check out up and coming games on www.IGN.com or www.Gamespot.com or something like that. Buy a PS3 magazine each month and see what takes your fancy. Going in a store and browsing really doesn't help as you rush yourself for making decisions and usually come out with a rubbish game that you only take back the next day.

j5Apt8hWaa	At this point, you are a kid with a 747 ... you need to take a basic class in photography to learn how to control all of its features if you want to avoid frustration, missed shots, bad habits using the traditional "try and fail" method.

Well, for now just set it on auto and have some fun.    But to get the most out of it, like it has been said by others, you'll need to spend some time on the net. There are lots of places giving photography info, just use a search engine.    There are photography forums. You should be spending a lot of time everyday there just reading a lot before you post any questions.    Understanding how all these things work is a lot of work, but it's all worth it, you'll see when you take some great photos. What kind of lens came with this gift?    I wish someone would give me something like this!    Start by spending lots of time here. http://www.dyxum.com/    It's a Sony/Minolta forum. Sony took over Minolta in 2005, and all the minolta lenses work (along with sony and Zeiss branded lenses) so you are going to see minolta mentioned a lot. We know more about Sony alphas and Minolta lenses than anybody else in the world.    Good luck and have fun.|`|HBNx77BBaa	Lucky you! There's a quite detailed review here which talks you through the controls to some extent....    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sonydslr...

0AUTZt5Aaa	Most people are clueless when it comes to backwards compatability questions.  They only think there is only one PS3--the one that they have, but just ignore  the people that say "yes, the 80GB plays PS2 games" or "No, the only one that   plays PS2 games is the 60GB. I don't blame the consumers, either. I think it is   Sony's fault for making so many PS3 models (20,60,80,40,80 again, 160) that it  can be confusing.    Anyways here's the answer you're looking for:    The only models that play PS2 games are:    20GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $500  60GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $600, later $550  Old 80GB-Discontinued, 80% of PS2 games $500    The following DO NOT:    40GB-Discontinued $400  New 80GB-in stores $400  160GB-in stores $500    All PS3's play PSone games.    An easy way to tell if a PS3 will play PS2 games    4USB ports=YES  2USB ports=NO    The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip/CPU  and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,  and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is  discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more  money than they already are losing on the PS3, and  hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.|`|AA12103453	No, no PS3 on the market can play PS2, and none coming out will be able to. You can still find expensive, never opened 60GB if you search online.|`|pl2SocVKaa	no only the 20gb which i don't recommend old 80gb and 60gb do|`|vs3vz6lIaa	Not sure|`|H162bS7kaa	Nope.

0d811LEXaa	I woudn't charge it it right away, I would use it and run down the battery completely first and then charge it for about 24 hours even though it will say fully charged after a few hours.    I do that with my phone and it lasts about 3 to 5 days depending on how long I talk on it.  My sister charges hers every day and only will last her a couple of days.    Just what I do, not really sure about I-pods but the bad thing about those is that you only get one battery and when that goes bad it is just a paperweight after that.    Good luck and enjoy your new I pod touch|`|6bQFiOvyaa	Yes, I think they come with some battery life, but its always best to give it a good charge! Also its handy to have it plugged in whilst converting your music to it.|`|bHKwnQxZaa	Definetley Yes!  any portable electronic as soon as i get it let it change for 24 hours because it increases the battery life or lets you ultilize all of the battery space

Not noteworthy per se, but with everything else it gives me even more pause.<br>  <br>  [Edit]<br>  Oh… here's more.  When you attempt to check out, the login page is not secure (no SSL).  That would make sense for a scam site because you have to prove your company's identity to obtain a recognized SSL certificate.  And the button on the login form: "Sing in".

The reason they have their billing department in Italy is because you are not going to go after them in Europe once you've realized you've been scammed.<br>  <br>  Third Clue: They require you to pay up front through Western Union money transfer. Legitimate companies do not require you to pay via Western Union. Think about this for a minute....you have to physically go to a Western Union office to make payment. Once your payment is sent you have no recourse and no way to get your money back when you realize you've been scammed. That's why they don't accept credit cards or checks.<br>  <br>  Fourth Clue: the email address listed for them is sales@alldigitalspro.com. Note the 's' added to the purported website address? Type in www.alldigitalspro.com and you'll see that it leads to nothing.<br>  <br>  I just ordered two Plasma televisions through their site to see what their process is and they sent a new account verification email and one with instructions to send payment via Western Union to some guy in Rome. Bottom line is that you will absolutely, without question, lose any money you pay them. You will not receive any merchandise and you will not be able to reach them. You've been properly warned.<br>  <br>  P
vkzkXWfzaa	You can put the pictures back onto the memory card, but your camera won't be able to see them. They are there and another computer can see and download them, but your camera can't.<br>  <br>  On your camera there will be a DCIM folder (Digital Camera Image Management) which records physically where on your card the pictures begin and end. This info is not required by a computer so is stripped off when you download. As this info is not there on an uploaded picture your camera doesn't know of their existence. If you continue to take pictures your camera will overwrite these locations with the new pictures leading to file fragment being left on the card, which in turn can lead to card corruption.<br>  <br>  Formating the card in camera renews this DCIM file. <br>  <br>  Chris|`|sA7DuUUBaa	make a text file on the desktop and try copy and pasting it to the memory stick see if that works this is to test the device that its writeable. then go from there. if it is then there might be that your not copy and past it correctly. if the test text file dont copy to the memory stick then you either have to format the stick wich you is highly un likely because its done at the factory. but how to do it anyways FYI<br>  open my computer or start click on computer youll see a extra drive letter in there while the memory stick is pluged in F,E. etc whatever Not C or D or A right click on the new drive lettter choose format.

SKkE3fK1aa	Ok, if your 6500 is locked or previously locked to a network, then YOU NOR ANYONE ELSE (except the network provider) WILL NOT HAVE THE SECURITY CODE. However, if you have gotten the phone from a Nokia Store and is unlocked from the start, then you should ask the guy you swapped from for the security code. It's the only way.|`|5moe3pEeaa	12345 is the only known code that NOKIA uses.<br>  If it doesn't work, you can not retrieve that code.<br>  The only thing you can legally do is contact NOKIA, so that they can tell you where you can bring the phone to unlock.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	We believe you, honestly!

SKkE3fK1aa	Just like what Jozii answered, I recommend the W890i (not the 50, but the 90, its newer). The W890i is a great cellphone inclined to music and multimedia mobility so don't expect it to be like a computer (that's what smartphones are for).<br>  <br>  W890 has 3G so you can surf the web using your phone's network faster than with GPRS (2G). 3G will only be enabled in your phone if your Network Service has 3G support! The fastest it can go is 3.5 MBPS (HSDPA/3.5G Connection).<br>  <br>  W890 has a memory card slot so you can put a lot of videos and music on it! Also, it has Bluetooth so you can send them to your friends with bluetooth enabled handsets. A great 3.2 Megapixel camera is great for taking good memories by the lens.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	well i love the w580i|`|PGArs0DZaa	omg, i so know the answer! <br>  right, this is quite an old phone, but it did EVERYTHiNG i wanted it to do and more, at the moment i have a touch screen pink samsung tocco, and i prefer my old one!<br>  the sony ericson w850i had a huge memory card, and could store hundreds of music, loooads of texts, THOUSANDS of pictures and ALL at the same time!<br>  its easy to use, lasts for ages, you can get it in black/white or on the market you can buy different coloured covers like pink etc : ) <br>  it has a 2.0 mp camera which is pretty good tbh, it has its own editor built into the phone and when it plays music it can play it preeetty loud! : )<br>  this has been my favourite phone in the whole universe, i recommend it 100% three times over.<br>  trust me its amazing! :D<br>  hope this helps|`|f5MCwml0aa	SONY ERICSSON GSM Mobile Phone Model No: K530i + Bluetooth Headset <br>  Price: Rs.9890 <br>  EMI :Rs. 1648 for 6 months <br>  Seller : Trendz|`|qJTS4WBoaa	I think any of them are good.

ur9fI1X3aa	I have the same problem, here's my solution, during COD World At War (not COD4) you can see how many people are in that server at that time. When going on the PS3 during the day from around 6 til 3.30 in the afternoon it will be mostly American servers, there are three options all, either keep searching for servers until you come across an Australian one, if you connect to the PSN wirelessly then you won't be able to host a game yourself due to the unreliability of that type of connection where as if your plug your ethernet cable directily from your modem to the PS3 you will be able to host games yourself giving you the ultimate connection. Third and finally, wait until after 4 pm, that's when most Aussie's finish school and work and you will get more and more Aussie servers as the night progresses.<br>  I use all of these techniques depending on how long it takes to find Aussie servers during the day, if i can be bothered unplugging my Ethernet and plugging it into the PS3 and changing the Network Connection settings. These are the only 3 ways of attempting to get good servers, there isn't a way of telling what servers are Aussie and what aren't, some games, take Resistance for instant, they tell you who is host and you can look at their profile and it tells you what country they are from, making it possible to tell if you will get a good connection or not. Otherwise you just have to hope for the best and add as many Aussies to your friends network as possible to ensure when they are online they themselves might host games or might invite you into one with a good connection...<br>  <br>  Feel free to add me, I'm always playing COD5 sometimes COD4 as well<br>  <br>  my network name is<br>  <br>  hard-2b-pretty<br>  <br>  <br>  Happy gaming|`|QoWi0hzWaa	yeh that lag is so f'in anying i keep getin 6 kills i get a 1on1 i put a whole round in his head and he survies and i loose my spree
lebKMTaQaa	Well, let me put it to you this way. I have owned both games. I still have GTA4 but I sold AC as soon as I finished it. The only game I have sold since buying my PS3 a year and a half ago I might add!<br>  <br>  AC is a good game with beautiful graphics and scenery; fun if a little drawn out, repetitive and a crap ending (to the point that you aren't even sure if it DID end).<br>  <br>  GTA4 is well put together, with a few of the classic GTA glitches (clipping, aiming issues, and the tendency for run into a few extraordinarily hard missions that cause you to just start blowing things up for no reason, which is fun...), but it is a game that I will keep in my library until I buy a new system, because I will go back and play it every now and again.<br>  <br>  Go with GTA4. A much more satisfying game overall.|`|QxtdyNvgaa	gta 4 clearly<br>  would you rather be a nerdy rebel in a gothic time and play online on assasins creed with barely anyone,NO<br>  get gta 4 its better but the missions get boring and repetetive and once you finished it you wont even touch it agaon!|`|7tk6ucNDaa	GRAND THEFT AUTO 4.u cant be boring play it again and again.i just finish it 3 time.|`|9bG4PRRUaa	GTA:4<br>  Assassins Creed is so nerdy|`|X7ig5Hjvaa	Assassins Creed hands down|`|PxqcLkw1aa	Get them both.

Ec4YjJxGaa	Those things you bought are just speakers you need a digital prosessor to hook all those speaker up...you may be able to hook two of those speakers up through audio out, but it would not be very loud because you need an amplifier with 5.1 surround sound to drive them all, most processors in this country come with an amplifier built in but I would ask first just to make sure that it has both a 5.1 processor and an amplifier.
FHd935KRaa	pcsx2 to emulator is game depend so that means that it depend on which game you are trying to run some games don't work with pcsx2 yet seach youtube and see if anyone has gotten you're game to run if they have just copy their configuration. If you're looking for some magic config that let you run all games full speed you're out of luck buddy. Also configuration do you mean specs you're spec are alright but don't expect full speed every time recommend spec are c2d 3.2ghz|`|FIL4vngsaa	Theres no need to shout, by writing in caps!!!!
Ec4YjJxGaa	You probable have dust in the volume controls but the bigger problem is the amp in the receiver...even though it is rated at 100 watts a channel how do they come up with that figure, probably what they did is run a 1hz signal for 1 millisecond till it reached 100 watts at 1% distortion 1% is a lot especially for a narrow testing signal who knows what the distortion was at 30hz or 16hz maybe like 10% or 20%...you want a high current amp that can sustain signal for minutes not nanoseconds and has an RMS rating from 20 to 20,000 hrz look into the Denon receivers or the Onkyo or Harman Kardon there is a difference and that is why they cost more and are rated at lower powers.

o6JCM59Faa	Nokia N95 8Gb has better NAND RAM, 3D accelerometer, dual CPU, larger screen (great for N-Gage gaming), and love the design of N95 8Gb. On the other hand Nokia N85 have FP2 (Slide transition), OLED screen, has better music quality, video stabilizer, dual LED, better battery life, higher version of Symbian OS and newer edition Developer platform, but the keypad and navigation key look like n81 (just a piece of plastic), not really like it. Overall, Nokia N85 rocks!|`|opccJ8Ylaa	in my opinion the n85 seems like a better phone from what i've been looking up in the interest of getting a new phone (mine is really really old!). <br>  <br>  but if your planning on getting a new phone.. i'll have your old one ;)|`|SKkE3fK1aa	I suggest not to and wait for the N86 (8MP Camera!).<br>  <br>  The N95-8GB is great for N-gage gaming as well as 3D symbian games. The N95 has the Hardware Accelerator (Video card) and the accelerometer so why change?<br>  <br>  The N95 has a dual-core processor unlike the N85 so the 85 is slower than the 95.

qWicVoU9aa	The unlimited messaging feature does not include data access.  You have to either add data pay per use feature or a data bundle feature to get the internet access that is needed to send and receive picture messages.  The data pay per use feature is free and only charges you if you access the internet to surf or download or anything like that.  It does not charge you for the internet it uses while sending or receiving picture messages though as that cost is built in to the cost of the messaging feature itself.

63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	many of the newer dvds will not play dvd-r's|`|AbRfd29Haa	Ok... what program did you use to create the DVD image? I'm not asking which program you used to burn it, but how did you author the DVD? <br>  <br>  If that's confusing, you might have the answer... a DVD-Video is far more than copying movie files of some kind of video file to a DVD-R. DVD players can only be counted on to play DVD-Video files. If you have made a DVD-Video disc, you will find two directories on it, VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS, and some files (lots of them ending in .vob) under the VIDEO_TS directory. <br>  <br>  If you have not made a proper DVD-Video formatted disc, you need to find a program that does this. You might try this guide: <a href="http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=1635" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?a...</a><br>  <br>  Assuming you have correctly burned a DVD-Video, it could just be your DVD player. Some DVD players, primarily older ones, do not support DVD-Rs. Most of the time, that's just due to bugs, but being consumer devices, few companies bothered to update this in the early days. It's also possible that an older player will reject DVD-R just due to the fact they reflect less light (about 40%) than a glass mastered DVD (about 85%). That's due to laser aging. You can probably solve either problem by buying a new DVD player -- virtually all new DVD players will play properly made DVD-Video on DVD-R discs. And it's common for them to include a compatibility list: some play DivX, some MP3 or MP4, etc. <br>  <br>  You should try your discs on some other DVD players, though, before running out to get a new DVD player (sure, they're cheap, but let's make sure you know where the problem is).|`|0nAhDKRYaa	DVD format is VOB, you have to convert your video to DVD compatible video at first, otherwise standard DVD player can not read and play it. If you don't know how to do that, I'd recommend this all-in-one DVD Creator to you, I always use it to convert and burn movie to DVD to play on my home TV, it's easy to use and works pretty well, if you are interested in it, here is a step by step guide about how to use it.<br>  <a href="http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-burn-avi-divx-movie-to-playable-dvd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reviewstown.com/how-to-burn-a...</a><br>  Hope it helps, email me if you need further help or use <a href="http://www.ask.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com</a> to search for more answers.

fPLv0QrSaa	HDMI cables carry a digital signal. If the picture looks okay with your cheap cable then it wouldn't look any better with an expensive cable. Cables are made to meet a specification and the cheap ones often meet the same specs as the expensive ones. The extra $70 is paying for the name brand. Some people say they can see a subtle difference when using an expensive cable. They are full of crap. A digital signal is either going to make it through the cable or not. It doesn't matter if the 1 or 0 is "clean". It only matters that the 1 or 0 is decipherable. Spread the word so others don't get ripped off. A local electronics dealer was trying to sell my wife's friend a cable for $100. She had one delivered from Amazon for $8 and it works great.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	The difference?  When it comes to performance there is no difference.  The more expensive ones may be better for longer lengths, but for the most part the extra cost is a combination of overbuilding the cables and just plain ripping off the customer.|`|0IWZXeL9aa	Nothing at all....they are all the same.  HDMI.org has the same manufacturing standards for ALL of the cables, so they have the same to meet.<br>  <br>  Plus, there are only about 20 companies or so certified to make them.  At the end of the day, a digital signal is a digital signal...same result.|`|Qb0GHd19aa	The only thing is gold-plated connectors but since HDMI is a digital cable if your tv is outputting the video then it is just as good as the $100 which just look more fancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. If you ever need to buy anymore cables you should get them from monoprice.com because they sell good quality cables for cheap and I mean CHEAP! I have bought cable through them various times and all my cables have been great.|`|Ec4YjJxGaa	Usually the build quality is not as good on cheaper cables, They tend to be a little stiffer, not as flexable, the connectors are usually not as good as on the better cables and the shielding may not be as good as on a more expensive cable, but I've seen cabes in the 10 to $15 range that have good quality all around.|`|fN2xiQL7aa	The difference is the price and possibly the quality. Somethings are just meant to be bought at a higher price to ensure longevity and quality of said purchased product.

akvrwpywaa	Well, in theory, yes.  The emissivity of an object is equal to its absorptivity, so technically all the light reflected by the televisions is in fact electromagnetic radiation, although in the form of light.  Every physical object, from TV's to couches to forks to other humans, does this.<br>  CRTs, Plasma TV's, and the backlights of LCD's do the same thing when they have electrical currents running: electrons are excited and thus release energy, electromagnetic radiation.  When they're turned off, there is no (or negligible) electrical current flowing through the device that creates a picture, so there is no radiation being given off this way.  Even when the TV is on, you're only being exposed to trivial amounts; for example, the screens of CRT's are heavily leaded to make sure that no stray short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation given off when the electrons hit the phosphors on the screens to produce colors.  (And that's why they're heavy.)

You may need to take the batteries out and type a bunch of keys to drain off the residual current then put them back in.<br>  Always check the condition of the batteries to make sure they are not weak.<br>  <br>  Is this the first time you have used it and it wont work? There is a setup menu on the PS3 (mine is not connected at the moment so I can not give you the specific menu directions).

Have not seen a camera that compares with the video from a camcorder and camcorders can't take good quality photos.  Suggest the least expensive Canon Camcorder and the Canon A590IS camera. <br>  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=174&modelid=16172#ModelFeaturesAct" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a> ...<br>  <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Internet speed on the other hand doesn't really change by which laptop you choose, unless its really really slow. I think if it has to be one of those you should stick with the, Acer Aspire One 8.9-inch Mini.<br>  <br>  For more computer tips go to: <a href="http://computertipsnow.com" rel="nofollow">http://computertipsnow.com</a>

VMVW3E7Aaa	The answer to this VERY common question is nearly always "No". <br>  <br>  Read your manual  -  if it was possible, you can be sure your manual would tell you how to do it.<br>   <br>  Even if you COULD find the necessary drivers, software etc, why would you even WANT to use your still camera (think of all the wear and tear on camera and batteries), when a $20 web cam does a perfectly wonderful job of it and can remain all hooked up and ready to use?<br>  <br>  Had you bothered to do a quick search, you would have found MANY answers to this.
TbTO5SXlaa	DPI: Dots Per Inch.<br>  <br>  To determine how big you can print, divide the resolution by the DPI you want to print at. Suppose your maximum resolution is 4288 x 2848 and you want to print at 300dpi. You can print at 9" x 14". 200dpi? 14" x 21". 150dpi? 19" x 28".<br>  <br>  Just remember that the larger the print the greater the viewing distance. Billboards, which are intended to be viewed from hundreds of feet, are usually printed at 40dpi or less.|`|BYHmKxpdaa	dpi=Dots per inch. The more dots per inch, the better. The less dpi, the grainier the picture.

ygGr1nX7aa	I don't think you can play it on the DS- the DS just isn't powerful enough to run a full Wii game.  The only DS function I've heard of that game having is that it lets you use the DS as a way to take your character to visit someone else's town on their Wii without connecting to the internet- in which case what you describe would mean it's working perfectly.  Sorry.
Cl8FwsI2aa	Don't buy the new 80 GB PS3 that is in stores now because it doesn't provide compatibility with PS2 games. This was due to the removal of "Graphics Synthesizer" GPU, which stripped the units of all PlayStation 2 based hardware.<br>  <br>  The old 80 GB PS3 CECHExx (released in North America and Korea), which was capable of playing some PS2 games via software (emulation), was discontinued. Due to emulation of the "Emotion Engine", the level of compatibility was reduced.<br>  <br>  Sony released a compatibility list; 1,782 of the 2,451 PS2 games (73%) released in Europe were playable on the European PS3.<br>  <br>  If you want to check the software compatibilty status of a particular game, then go here:-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/CompatibleStatus" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/Co...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	The only models that play PS2 games are:<br>  <br>  20GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $500<br>  60GB-Discontinued, all PS2 games $600, later $550<br>  Old 80GB-Discontinued, 80% of PS2 games $500***<br>  <br>  The following DO NOT:<br>  <br>  40GB-Discontinued $400<br>  New 80GB-in stores $400<br>  160GB-in stores $500<br>  <br>  All PS3's play PSone games.<br>  <br>  An easy way to tell if a PS3 will play PS2 games<br>  <br>  4USB ports=YES<br>  2USB ports=NO (and NO means NO)<br>  <br>  The reason is that the cost of putting the PS2 chip/CPU<br>  and the PS2 graphics card in the PS3 was VERY expensive,<br>  and as the PS2 only has about a year left (before it is<br>  discontinued), Sony saw no reason to lose even more<br>  money than they already are losing on the PS3, and<br>  hence there is no backwards compatibility on PS3's today.<br>  <br>  *** The old 80GB PS3 had the PS2 CPU in it, but it used software to emulate the <br>  graphics card or GPU.

After that, connect your phone to the computer via USB and select 'PC Suite'.<br>  <br>  If your phone is still not detected, then I recommend you open Nokia PC Suite and click the 'Connect a Device' button (if you have the latest!) then just follow instructions. You have to wait a while in the 'Please Connect Your Device Now' even if it seem like nothing is happening!<br>  <br>  If still none, then use 'Data Transfer' or 'Mass Storage' option on your phone.|`|BhQ4sNayaa	I haven't had any issues with my Nokia N-GAGE.

lEYrs02Raa	Are you still using alkaline batteries? If so, alkaline batteries just don't have the power for more than a few pictures in a digital camera. Some may also have reached their shelf life, and though right out of the package may even have problems just powering startup of the camera. Digital cameras that use AA's for the most part should only be used with rechargeable NiMH batteries. If you read the camera's instruction manual concerning batteries, you may see the same recommendation.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind rechargeable NiMH batteries will save you money in the long run over alkalines, AND they'll last for at least 100 pictures per charge (and probably many many more). You'll be very pleased with their performance, and may be angry with yourself for not buying them sooner. When at the store, look on the package for a power rating of at least 2500 mah. <br>  <br>  Finally, if using better batteries don't help, then it's time to return the camera for exchange as something else is likely wrong with it.

Also, it can work out cheaper because if you go on contract it works out less than buying it, unfortunately the network isn't very good in most places.<br>  <br>  i've never known anyone who had a classic, but i had a shuffle and it was really rubbish. <br>  <br>  so overall, it depends what your looking for, but i'd go for the touch, because the phone has a really crappy network and it'll just annoy the hell out of anyone who buys it. my mate never has any signal and when he gets one bar he's jumping for joy so.... but definitely the touch :]|`|xVceKP3Vaa	Well, I have a nano and it is really good i am saving up for an iPod touch because they seem awesome.

You'll need to apply pressure which makes some people get antsy, though performance isn't anything different from normal resistive devices. The sensitivity isn't as good as a capacitive display, but being  a device geared for business they probably would make it usable for the businessmen in cold weather. The biggest complaint about the X1 is that the screen is recessed slightly inside, making it harder to press the edges of the screen (like the windows key).|`|i1ffKz75aa	its lil slow,,,,,/:(<br>  <br>  <a href="http://haroon-aejaz.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://haroon-aejaz.blogspot.com</a>

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	While most cameras take video, and some camcorders take photos; to get the best of both, you need both. Have not seen a camera that compares with the video from a camcorder and camcorders can't take good quality photos.  Suggest the least expensive Canon Camcorder and the Canon A590IS camera. <br>  <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=174&modelid=16172#ModelFeaturesAct" rel="nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/contro...</a> ...<br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ...

Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. <br>   <br>  Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.

Even though it's the least expensive, it's also the most capable (for photos) of the three.  The A590 has additional manual shooting modes over the other cameras that may come in handy for low-light shooting.  <br>  <br>  But if you're also interested in quality video, then I would next gravitate to the A2000IS, as it produces video at a higher frame rate than the A590 (thus with smoother looking videos).  <br>  <br>  And as for durability, none of the three are going to take a beating.  Take care of them, even in your bag (maybe use a hard case?).  Also make a concentrated effort to keep dirt and sand off these cameras, especially their lens barrels.  Otherwise you'll encounter the infamous lens error problem inherent to all digital cameras with telescopic lens barrels.

tkTkVw0Raa	I am a tower dog and do climb inspections on them I do about 500 inspections a year and occasionally get to talk with the land owners who lease out the property to the people that want the tower on their land.  It seems to me that the more populated of an area you are in the more money you can get.  one guy I talked to was getting $2300 a month for his and he had 3 levels of antennas. then again I have talked with another that had 7 levels on his and onlt got $1200 a month. My suggestion is get a lawyer to dicuss the agreement.  Secondly MAKE SURE you get a co-location agreement. This allows you to increase the rent amount when more companies want to put more antennas on the tower. More antennas mean more traffic to the site which some landowners dont want.  So no i dont think that is a fair offer.|`|K5L63wbeaa	Ill be honest and say I have no idea what they usually pay but if I were you, I'd want a lot more then a measly $200 per month.

AA10912074	I consider Nikon and Canon very comparable.  It really gets down to individual tastes.  They both build quality cameras and you get access to a huge set of lenses, from consumer grade to professional.  Nikon on certain models that are better than Canon, and vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Other companies, like Sony, build good equipment as well.  If you are considering photography as something you want to pursue in the future, I'd probably stick with Canon or Nikon.  If what you are looking for is more something for your own enjoyment for a few years other brands are fine as well.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	There is no doubt that Nikon and Canon make fine cameras. However, Sony and Pentax should not be ignored. Pentax has been around for a very long time and Sony, although a relative newcomer in the DSLR world, has a long history in video and optics. In fact, Sony was the first to market a non-film SLR - the Mavica of 1981. It had three interchangeable lenses: 25mm f2, 50mm f1.4 and a 16-65mm f1.4 zoom.<br>  <br>  Now Sony and Pentax are beginning to get recognition for several innovations in the DSLR world. First and foremost is their decision to place their versions of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body. Rather than have only some lenses with IS like Canon and Nikon and making people pay for it with every lens, Sony and Pentax decided that every lens used should have the benefit of IS. Have you noticed that the latest Nikon and Canon DSLRs are being sold now with an IS lens?<br>  <br>  The fans of Nikon and Canon will have you believe that Sony has a limited lens selection. That isn't exactly true. Since Sony bought the DSLR manufacturing and technology from Konica-Minolta and Minolta introduced the world's first full-featured auto focus SLR, the Minolta Maxxum 7000, in 1985, every Maxxum AF lens made since then is compatible with any Sony DSLR. I counted 61 Maxxum/Sony lenses on the wikipedia site. <br>  <br>  Sure, a Nikon lens from 1965 will mount to a modern Nikon DSLR but it won't have IS. A Canon EF mount lens from 1990 will mount on a modern Canon DSLR but it won't have IS.. A 24 year old Maxxum AF lens on a Sony DSLR will have the IS benefit.<br>  <br>  The Pentax DSLR cameras are still using the venerable K-mount introduced with the 35mm K-1000 around 1975. So every K-mount lens ever made will, with some limitations, mount to a Pentax DSLR. Of course every one of them will have the benefit of IS.<br>  <br>  I suggest looking at the Sony A300. Its a 10mp DSLR with Live View that actually works with the AF. Need to hold the camera over your head to get the picture? Just flip the screen down and you can compose, check focus and shoot. Shooting macro from ground levl? Just flip the screen up. Have a desire to take really candid pictures? Flip the screen up, let the camera hang down and you can discreetly look down, compose and take the picture without your subject ever knowing.<br>  <br>  Sony A300 w/18-70mm and 55-200mm zoom lenses $699.99 at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a> $599.99 with just the 18-70mm zoom.<br>  <br>  If I were making the purchase I'd first try to find these Maxxum AF lenses: <br>  <br>  50mm f1.4 <br>  24mm f2.8<br>  35-70mm f4 and 70-210mm f4 zooms<br>  <br>  Then I'd buy just the A300 body. If I couldn't find the lenses listed I'd go for the 2 lens package.|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_reviews/panasonic_fz28.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...</a><br>  <br>  It just came out on November 4, 2008.<br>  <br>  It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing skateboarding, action sports; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature and concert photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com. in the U.S.<br>  <br>  Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/bf/1b/a83ac060ada0881604bad110.L.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|s1OjeSffaa	I was a Canon fan for a long time. Switched to Nikon.........and will never go back. In the last couple years, Nikon has left Canon in the Dust.....Go for The Nikon D90...........nothing less.....will be a very good camera for years to com.....I own(ed).........D70s, D200, D300, and now D700.  Forget Canon or Sony, nobody will want to buy it if you want to upgrade it!|`|2bVxBCgzaa	I'd definitely recommend the Canon XSi. It is an excellent camera, with image quality rated best in its class, and even comparable to some semi-pro cameras in some ways. The reviews of the XSi place it as the best entry-level DSLR at this time. You could also look at the Canon 40D- a step up in several ways, and discounted recently to close to the same price as the XSi. The Nikon D40 is also a fantastic camera- you can get one with two lenses for about $550- 600 these days.<br>  The best thing is to start reading the review sites- dpreview, imaging resource, steves digicams, dcresource, etc. Decide on a few possibilities, then take someone with you to a camera store and spend an hour holding the camera, testing it out, playing with the menus and controls. Any decent camera will take great photos- it's more about your knowledge and skill than the camera, so pick the one you feel comfortable using. I'd only advise against the Olympus E-series- they are OK, but I very much wish I had not chosen to get one for my first DSLR- they are very noisy in long exposures/low light, and there are a few functionality issues that I really don't like... That's just my opinion- I'll probably get ten photographers here telling me why I'm an idiot.<br>  <br>  EDIT*- Edwin below me here makes some excellent points about the Pentax and Sony- both great cameras. I singled out the XSi because of the reviews of its image quality vs the Sony or Pentax. They take excellent photos, but IMHO based on the reviews, the Canon has better results overall. And sensor-based IS isn't quite as good as lens-based; of course, IS lenses will cost a bit more then not-stabilized lenses; only you can make that decision. I've considered the Sony myself- but then I look at what the pros use- for DSLRs, it's almost universal; Canon or Nikon. And so if you go with the Canon or Nikon now, decide to get serious at some point and upgrade to a pro or semi-pro level camera, then you'll have the lenses from your first DSLR and the body to use as a backup.

So that sounds like the most likely cause.<br>  <br>  If you don't use the component cable, and just the RCA cables that came with it, it has to be something else. There is only 1 video cord in that set.

0AUTZt5Aaa	NOTE: Skip ahead to the *** if you aren't interested in reading an essay lol and just want to see the comparison of PSN VS LIVE (3rd paragraph from the bottom)<br>  <br>  Why you should get a PS3 and NOT a Xbox 360<br>  <br>  The *expected* lifetimes of current home video game consoles:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360--2005-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Wii-2006-2010, you'll get 1 and a half years out of it<br>  Playstation 3-2015 (Sony said they made it to last 10 years, so 2006+10 years=2016, round it down just to be safe), you'll get 7 years out of it.<br>  <br>  In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future and it has over-the-top graphical capabilities (google “Heavy Rain”). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:<br>  <br>  With the PS3, you get:<br>  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet<br>  -Free online service<br>  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.—in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time, 128 VS 128)<br>  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.<br>  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi<br>  -Web browser<br>  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive<br>  -HDMI 1.3, Xbox 360 only has HDMI 1.2 (major difference despite only a 0.1 difference)<br>  <br>  With the Xbox 360, you get:<br>  -DVD Player/upconverter<br>  -Xbox live, which is $50/year, and not even worth it<br>  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (that’s a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)<br>  -Umm…can’t really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories. 120GB for $150? With the PS3, you can upgrade to 500GB for $110!<br>  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")<br>  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 12th!<br>  <br>  So here’s a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  Console $400<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $55<br>  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do<br>  Total: $517 ($2 USB mini cable)<br>  <br>  Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money (gaming console+computer+SUPERB Blu Ray player)<br>  <br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Console $300<br>  Game $60<br>  Controller $60<br>  Play and Charge kit x2 $60 (for 2 controllers)<br>  Xbox Live $60<br>  Wi-Fi $100<br>  Total: $640<br>  <br>  That’s not cheaper, so get a grip on it! The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360’s potential. And they look the same, if not better on the PS3. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. It’s just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.<br>  <br>  ***Xbox Live VS PSN? The only thing you are missing is cross voice chat, which can easily be solved by using a telephone, or even in PSN’s V3.00 update, which we will be seeing soon enough.***<br>  <br>  The PS3 has sold 21 million units in 2 years. The Xbox 360 has sold 28 million in 3 years. Plus a 33% failure rate, that means that 9.24 million units are either refurbished ones or replacements. So really, the amount of one-time buyers is about 19 million. So really, the PS3 has sold 21 million in 2 years, while the Xbox 360 has sold 19 in 3 years, and the PS3 has a higher face value ($199.99 vs. $399.99)<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, the PS3 is better—you get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer—legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  --PS3 expert--|`|pl2SocVKaa	ps3 online is like the same so thats not a factor strictly game system ps3|`|YKbiJADQaa	I have a PS3, but I wish I got the 360.

AbRfd29Haa	I would try a file recovery utility. Flash cards use the "FAT" (File Access Table) file system to store photos -- that's the modern version of the file system from MS-DOS. There are directory tables that tell the system where the files are... those can become corrupt without any actual permanent loss of the photos. <br>  <br>  Once you recognize this situation, you want to do as little as possible. It's better to NOT let Windows do anything... just get your recovery program(s) and run them. A good recovery program does nothing to the flash card itself... in fact, you can try several without any problem, and once you're done, you can always let Windows "do its thing". <br>  <br>  Here's a page with several freeware programs. I have used Recuva successfully to rescue "deleted" photos from several memory cards (usually for someone else). You'll need the memory card mounted on the computer -- usually attaching the camera does this these days, if not, you'll need an SD reader.

hJP9y6kjaa	I'm not really a huge fan of EMG 81/85's. They're okay, but their main advantage is that they have a pretty hot, and relatively less noisy, output than comparable passive pickups.<br>  <br>  They aren't for everyone - they don't have as much low end as some other pickups, especially a lot of the high-output humbuckers, or other active pickups like Seymour Duncan Blackouts. They also have less dynamic range than passive pickups - they have a nice tone to them, but they play a little on the compressed/flat side... hard to describe. Play a Line 6 amp with a normal guitar, that's kind of what I mean.<br>  <br>  I don't agree that they're so hot that they overpower the rest of your rig. They are hot, but if you adjust their height (distance from the strings) you can control their output to a degree, and if they're *too* hot when close to the strings, you can always lower them a little and that will take care of that problem. Many people have used these pickups for all styles of music and are very happy with them.... I prefer the more "organic" tone of passive pickups, but I also have installed an onboard preamp to heat the tone up a little, and get the best of both worlds.<br>  <br>  For me personally, my favorite pickup combination is a Seymour Duncan Alnico II Pro in the neck and an Alternative 8 in the bridge. They both have Alnico magnets in them, so they have a very smooth and round response. The A2P has a very "Slash" sound when playing leads, and the Alt 8 has a deep low end chunk when distorted. Both coil-tap well and give decent approximations of single-coil tones. I used a 1 meg pot for the Alt 8 - I feel like this has helped open it up a little and have a little more "attack" and "snarl". They sound very good together, and have similar tones for a rather seamless transition between the two pickups (ie rhythm -> lead and back again).<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with getting EMGs in your guitar. Most players prefer them for metal, similar to the Seymour Duncan Blackouts. If I had to choose between them, I would choose the Blackouts... I've done the EMG thing, and I didn't like them. I've heard that the Blackouts are a little less prone to noise, as well. Either way, if you go this route, run them at 18v (two 9v batteries) if you can squeeze them in - it will give you a little bit better sound.<br>  <br>  Umm, yeah. That's my two cents. There's a few onboard active effects at the link below that are both cheap and useful... the next time I buy an onboard preamp this is where I'm going to buy it.<br>  <br>  I purchased their active pickup set... basically EMG knock-offs. I don't think the tone is all that great, but they are quiet. The biggest thing I've noticed is that you *have* to get them pretty close to the strings for them to sound good. For 100$ after tax and shipping, the price was right. I don't know if that would be the direction you'd want to go for a nice Gibson, though. If you've got the cheddar (cheese, scratch, dinero, moolah etc) I'd spring for something better than their cheapo actives... but I'm not too disappointed, for the price they're worth it to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|405caad2defc93e4e2201178f72bf6e4aa	The EMG's are of a much better quality than the standard pickups that come with the studio because they are good quality active pickups and have a much beefier sound.  But .....<br>  <br>  Only get active pickups if you're prepared to dedicate your whole rig to them, otherwise there's no point.<br>  <br>  This means you need to stop using any boost/overdrive/fuzz/distortion pedals and you'll need to get used to fully cranking the volume on a naturally high-gain tube amp (e.g. most ENGL and Mesa heads), and you'll have to get used to leaving that gain control at 0.<br>  <br>  Obviously this is fine for large club/small arena gigging but for anything else it's not really practical.  So, if you can't justify dedicating your rig to that set-up every time then you are better off with passive pickups.<br>  <br>  Others may disagree, but this has been my experience.
ApZ0qS88aa	The problem with games and TVs has been that static elements of the game's GUI (Graphical User Interface) namely health bars, ammunition counters, maps etc. could cause what's called burn-in, on CRTs (Thick screen TVs) and plasma (Actual plasma, not generic thin screen) displays this means that the phosphors which create an image on the screen wear unevenly, the phosphors that are always lit (such as those illuminated by static elements on the screen) lose their luminance in relation to the rest of the display resulting in those static elements constantly appearing as a burnt-in image.<br>  <br>  LCDs are not affected by burn-in in it's  traditional form, instead pixels in the display may become permanently lit causing a persistent image to appear however most displays are largely resistant to this and it is unlikely to occur over the operational lifetime of the display.|`|jKQkQB3Baa	no... there is no reason why it should be damaged =/|`|TX9EbUS2aa	Not to my knowledge.

hJP9y6kjaa	The biggest downside, to me, is that some CD burning programs have a hard time reading some of them correctly, and either burn too much space or not enough. My standard procedure at this point is to simply convert all of them, across the board, to the appropriate CBR bitrate.<br>  <br>  The upside (besides a small decrease in file size) is that they're supposed to be able to allocate more bits for the more complex musical passages and less for less complex (ie silence).<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't care about the difference between 6 mb and 8 mb, and I don't hear a significant advantage, especially if you've burned at a decent bitrate in the first place (ie 192 kbps or higher) with a decent application (ie CDex, really anything using the lame mp3 codec, so NOT windows media player etc).<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	No cable box? Does that mean you don't have HD as well? You never ever hook TV audio out to a surround system. It is only 2 channel at best and the TV is not passing coded 5.1 out through an RCA jack. It will make it louder but you will get the same sound in ever speaker. Not true surround sound over 5 channels. <br>  <br>  Your home theater in a box (HTIB) probably doesn't have a cable in for just coax TV but maybe it does? You still won't be able to get surround sound from it even if you can hook it up to the HTIB.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you need to upgrade your TV service to an HD feed with your provider so you can get 5.1 dolby surround broadcasts.

AA10912074	You have some good answers already, but I would add that you should keep the lens on the camera at all times.  One of the problems you can have with digital SLRs is getting dust on the camera's sensor.  It is a pain to get off, and sometimes it is just better to pay a camera store $60 to have them do it. <br>  <br>  Dust can get in your camera many different ways, but the easiest way is to sneak in when you are changing lenses, or in your case taking the lens off for storage.  If you only have one lens, keep it on the camera at all times.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	The kiss of death for camera equipment is fungi, this can eat into the glass and render it useless.<br>  <br>  Fungi thrives in enclosed, dark, damp and warm places, so the worst place is enclosed in any camera bag which is dark and warm and if you had it out in the rain damp as well. Plastic is a big no-no as it holds in moisture as well.<br>  <br>  The best place is on a dry, sunlit shelf with plenty of air around it, not in its box or case particularly leather (as it holds the spores). Display cabinets work well as they keep off the dust (the other hazard). UV kills fungi.<br>  <br>  More old lenses get fungi from being kept in those old leather cases which look good, but are a perfect breeding ground for fungi.<br>  <br>  The very best way to look after your equipment is just to take it for an airing regularly.<br>  <br>  Chris

It is an alternative to the RCA connector when used for composite video on commercial video devices, although many consumer electronics devices with RCA jacks can be used with BNC-only commercial video equipment via a simple adapter. BNC connectors were commonly used on 10base2 thin Ethernet networks, both on cable interconnections and network cards, though these have largely been replaced by newer Ethernet devices whose wiring does not use coaxial cable. Some ARCNET networks use BNC-terminated coax.|`|9MZwq04laa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_connector" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_connect...</a><br>  I  can't say it any better than Wikipedia so why try?<br>  These have been used on everything from police scanners to computer networks and from security monitors to scoreboards.

You may not think you need extra room, but you probably need to go ahead and get more room just in case.|`|TPqIYqWCaa	you should get a 8 gig and by things to protect it and like a easy to carry case and screen protectors it also depends on how much music you have I have a 16 gig and still have not been able to fill it up|`|B0vGGTDYaa	I, like some people who really love music, want to get the latest tunes.

I know i LOVE music so i had to get a bigger ipod i ended up getting the ipod touch but anyways overall It is like any other ipod just with a less capacity.

j5Apt8hWaa	You will need some kind of fully adjustable camera, either a 35 mm SLR or DSLR camera.<br>  <br>  Lenses are only as steady as the photographer.  All lenses, even rank generic ones can produce sharp photos ... blur is caused by camera movement.<br>  <br>  Shooting wildlife, you will need at least a 300 mm lens (70-300 mm is a very popular lens for beginners)<br>  <br>  Shooting outside stuff, the popular 18-55 mm lens is a good one.  It will let you shoot wide angle landscapes to portraits.<br>  <br>  For close ups, you really need a good macro lens, but to keep within a smaller budget you can buy a set of diopters, + 1, +2, and + 3 that you can screw on to the front of you standard lens.<br>  <br>  The use of selective focus is when you use a medium telephoto lens, shot wide open focus on your subject ( four to six feet from the camera) and this will throw the background out of focus.  It is NOT the results of using a photo program.<br>  <br>  You will be better off saving the $90 for Photoshop Elements and start learning how to use it, instead of having to download two or three "free" programs just to get the features you want and having to learn three different programs as well.<br>  <br>  If you ever do get to use Photoshop at work or school, you will already have the skills to use  it.<br>  <br>  A good beginners camera would be a Nikon D40 with 18-55 mm lens for under $450.

There are modchips for sale, however, but they can run $100+.|`|cHkcZLe6aa	Everyone who answered above is wrong except for the fact that the Wii cannot play DVDs out of the box.    The Wii CAN in fact play DVDs without a mod chip though and I have done it with mine.  I have seen a DVD player application on sale at a local EB Games store but I haven't tried it.  What you can do though is install the free Wii Homebrew Channel (google "Wii Homebrew" and you'll find multiple websites with complete instructions and video tutorials on how to do it).  Once you have the channel installed, you can browse and download a ton if different free homebrew applications/games/etc including media players that will play DVDs, music CDs or MP3's and videos from an SD card.    If you want to play burnt DVDs or CDs then you will need to have a modchip (unless someone figures out a homebrew app to enable the Wii to read those types of discs without the mod chip) but most commericially recorded DVDs and CDs will play.
Cl8FwsI2aa	Yes, get it. It's the best PS3 model to be released. Way better than the 80 GB model. It plays 99% of PS2 games via Hardware "Emotion Engine" (EE).

A PS3 has a 95% chance of not crashing on you after 5 years. It plays ps2 games, has 4 usb ports, has amazing vivid graphics, has a sleek cool look, dude definitely go for it. <br>  <br>  If you are wondering 60 gb is of course only 20 gb less than 80gb. So I wouldnt waste my money on buying an 80gb because its not much more memory. If you arents gonna save and download hundreds of things on it then of course take the deal. <br>  <br>  Good luck. Take it. <br>  ~Nick|`|GeHboi9vaa	First of all ps3 is not 100% backwards compatible. Meaning not all ps2 games can be played on it. I LOVE PS3. HATE X-BOX360. Get a ps3 brother.

tjg7hLbMaa	This is a really touch-and-go question because Japan's technology is so different versus the rest of the world.  Some Japanese SoftBank 3G and DoCoMo "FOMA" phones can be used on a regular GSM network, provided that the phone is unlocked. Generally phones in Japan are locked to a specific network so it cannot be used on others without unlocking it. It can be an expensive process so be sure to check that the phone is not locked before purchase. You may also have difficulty getting a Japanese phone unlocked in America since the companies unlocking can't just enter in a special code (it has to be linked to the particular model number and serial number of the phone)<br>  <br>  It is important to note that just because the Japanese phone has a SIM card, it doesn't mean it's compatible with the networks here. Their W-CDMA technology also uses SIM cards (which is the most popular technology there). You will need to ensure the phone is a GSM phone.<br>  <br>  You can find out here if your local provider in America is a GSM provider: <a href="http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/cou_us.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/...</a> - the most popular GSM providers are T-Mobile and AT&T. The Japanese phones cannot be used on non-GSM networks.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	unfortunately, the coolest phones are in Japan... because theyre invented there. to get some of the better models, you need to go in with proof of japanese citizenship. also, some only work on the japanese bandwidth, so they wont work with american carriers... or they might work, but only for calls and no internet/MMS/ etc. this is because the american companies dont have the right services to support the applications on the japanese phones. so it would be a waste of money. however, if what youre going for is a phone that is unlocked and that isnt offered by companies in america (so you dont end up with the same phone as everyone else), go on ebay. there are MANY reliable sellers that have new and unique phones that havent been picked up by companies yet! i had that new samsung 8mgpix camra phone 6 months ago, before tmobile picked it up. and it has all the original features, so im not stuck using only tmobile apps.<br>  try it.|`|JCFLE9mGaa	There are softbank phones (which are japanese) That can be purchased on ebay, but since they are made in japan, the technology stays in japan. The good news is..... You can buy an unlocking chip and put it in your new phone, and It could let you use it~ ^^ Yay. And your in luck, softbanks work for AT&T :] I think softbank phones are the most prettiest out of the other ones, so id suggest you'd get one :) Good luck, im so jealous of you. Im in verizon and i cant get a cool phone like you :[ Oh well, enjoy~|`|2rGrcnsLaa	depends what carrier are you in US .the first thing that you should know that the you can use the Japanese one if your carrier company has sim card not like verizon and sprint. then you should take it to one of the sores and they run a software on it and open the lock.<br>  so remember Japanese work only on sim card cellphone carriers.

Dont worry soon it wont matter alltel will be no more seeing how it is now Verizon Wireless.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	sometimes phone companies are SUPER busy, and their service goes to the wayside, especially if you dont call them and tell them there is something wrong with your line. this was happening to me (on verizon as well, who, as a company, should burn in hell) and didnt improve until I called 3 times with the same complaint. <br>  tell them that if the service keeps being faulty you have the right to be let go to another carrier that will provide you with the services you pay for. they will prioritize your signal. <br>  but seriously, change your service, those people are awful.|`|dwx5uKgbaa	Verizon is gay about that stuff for some reason. i have the same problem every once in a while. its not your phone, its our service cause i have the lg dare and i have the same problems. you can recieve other verizon messages instantly, but once it involves another company its weird sometimes. my mom dad brother and sister all have the same problem every once in awhile

2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	Unfortunately, no. $100 is actually a reasonable price for an LCD replacement by the OEM.<br>  <br>  Sending your Olympus Stylus 850 SW to an unauthorized repair center is a bad idea. A cracked LCD screen is a breach of the sealing offered by your camera. It's unlikely that an unauthorized repair service will be qualified to disassemble, repair, and reassemble your camera to the manufacturer's specifications (as is the case with expensive waterproof watches).|`|G3lI0Irjaa	cantact si_camerarepair@yahoo.com we can help you

Also, I was able to download .mp3 ringtones from other sources to my computer.  Then, I e-mailed each ringtone to myself.  When I read those e-mails on my Storm, it let me download each ringtone into the Storm.  Just make sure it saves the ringtone in the /Ringtones folder of the phone.

It's simply done @ any cell shop    When she is travelling down @ the USA get a Best Buy O2 sim card or T-mobile or at&t prepaid sim... Just switch sim cards to where she travels.    Probably O2 from bestbuy is the cheapest.    Or maybe tell your fiance to get Virgin Mobile Canada... or Koodo (Koodo's Texting is International included so no extra charges texting to USA)    As for you... Change to something else... Virgin Mobile USA is really crappy...    Go verizon or at&t or T-mobile... They're the big 3 for a reason... so you get roaming coverage...

zifxY45waa	Well, it is possible, but it will require several steps and two more programs (in addition to your iTunes I hope you already have)  First, you need to get the youtube videos (or ANY other web streamed video for that matter) on your harddrive = download them. You need program which will do that. There are several, but I like Orbit Downloader the most. It is free and it breaks youtube's anti-leech technology pretty well. Haven't find a clip I coudn't download yet:-)  You can grab it here:  http://www.orbitdownloader.com/    After installation, when you play youtube (or any other) video clip, small arrow in circle will show at right upper corner of the video. Click on it and it will ask you where to save the file.  You will get FLV (Flash video) file on your computer.    Then, you need to convert it into a iPod Touch format. The best converter I found is (again, free) VideoRa Ipod Converter. Version for iPod Touch is located here:  http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/i...    That will create mp4 file playable on your iPod.     Now, open iTunes, import the mp4 file in the library (go to File - add file, or simply open windows explorer window, navigate to where did you save the mp4 file, drag it by mouse and drop it onto iTunes window, it will import it.     Plug in the iPod, copy the file onto it and voila... here it goes.     Good luck and have fun...    Johnny    Addition:  Yes, you can use youtube channel, but only when you are connected by wifi - it will NOT save the video on your iPod and you cannot watch it without online connection (like when you are on the bus for example).|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	You have to download and convert the youtube video to mp4 video at first, then you can add it to iTunes and sync it to your iPod.

RpCwfcRzaa	Two in three years isn't bad. I think I'm on my tenth. The headsets are made cheaply and aren't meant to last forever. They're basically impossible to fix because they have such tiny solder points and flimsy wires. You'd spend more time and money on solder than actually buying a new one.

The gnome cheat must be entered before the other cheats will work.        * Gnome Cheat: R2, L1, R1, L2, LEFT, CIRCLE (a gnome will appear on the Sim's property signifying cheats are now allowed). You can click this gnome for money.      * Fill motives: L2, R1, LEFT, CIRCLE, UP      * Unlock all locations: R2, R3, L3, L2, R1, L1      * Unlock all objects: L2, R2, UP, TRIANGLE, L3      * Unlock all Socials: L1, R1, DOWN, X, L3, R3      * Unlock Team Photos: L3, R3, R1, R2      * Unlock all skins: L1, R2, X, CIRCLE, UP, DOWN         Hint: Mindless Fun  If one of your Sims is in a bad mood and you want to quickly get his or her mood back into the good zone without constantly overseeing it, make a small room with windows and a door into the house (this door is to be torn down later).    Then add a microwave, counter, fridge, a three seater sofa (so the Sim can sleep on it), a TV, lights, a toilet, a table, chairs and anything else if you want to. This will supply everything your sim will need.    Get the Sim to enter the room and go remove the door. Make the Sim test everything out and it will not go out the room (while its happiness increases). Connect the room back to the main house when the Sim has gotten more happier.    Hint: Mo' Money  First enable the Cheat Gnome R2, L1, R1, L2, Left, Circle. Then after you have done that enable this code L1, R2, Right, Square, L3 (on the left analog stick). After you have done so click on the gnome in the front strip of grass and select "give money" You will get 10,000 simoleons every time you do that. NOTE: The gnome will show up there about 30 min. [sim time]        ZeroStarRage has an alternate entry L1, R2, RIGHT, SQUARE, L3 for 10,000 Simoleans. A blue sparkling gnome should appear in the front lawn to the left of the mailbox, just tell one of your sims to do one of the following options: Fill All Motives or Give Money!      Hint: Get rid of ghost at Goth Manor  First unlock the fortune table and place it back where it goes. Tell a fortune or contact the dead the make the ghosts go away.    Hint: Ultimate Regeneration  Purchase the bed with 7 comfort and 11 energy for 1,290 Simoleans (Miss Memo sleep chamber). When your Sim needs swift energy to recover after a party or to gain skills for promotion, make sure there are two side tables in the same room as the bed and place two Aromaster Whifferpuffs on those tables. Activate the Juniper on one and the Lavender on the other (should be 2nd and 3rd) and then go to bed. This will exponentially increase energy recovery and fun also. NB Don't activate the Lavender if your fun is full. This will cost under 6,500 Simoleans)  hope this helps:)
RyvKws7Laa	Woah, loads of questions...<br>  <br>  720p vs 1080p is resolution of the screen.  A 720p TV's resolution is going to be in around 1280x720 (sometimes its an odd number slightly larger).  At 1080p TV, that is full HD, will be 1920x1080 (maximum HD resolution that exists).  So off the numbers people assume 1080p is better.  And off the numbers they are right.  But in reality, TV size matters too.  If you're looking at 42" and above, 1080p matters.  At the 32" you quote, 720p will look amazing.  If you find a TV with 1080p at that size that is in your budget, great, but don't go paying extra for it and don't make that your make-or-break spec for your decision.  You just don't see the 1080p advantages on a 32" screen.<br>  <br>  High Definition means higher picture resolution.  Standard Definition is only 720x480 (in North America).  As you can see from my 720p vs 1080p bit, HD is quite a bit larger in resolution.  What this means is a crisper more detailed image.  Its an aesthetic thing, and its hard to describe, it truly is "seeing is believing."  Everything just looks beautiful in HD.<br>  <br>  As for LCD vs Plasma, on a pure tech standpoint, Plasma will give you a better picture.  It will give you better color, better contrast, and better blacks.  BUT, same as with 1080p, TV size matters.  When you dip below the 40's the Plasma advantages become much harder to notice.  So in your case I would just worry about LCDs.<br>  <br>  As for brands, Samsung is the leader in LCDs.  Sony/Panasonic/Sharp Aquos I would kind of clump as #2.  With certain models you could lean on Toshiba or LG, but mostly you're going down a tier to those (but they do have some models that perform very well).  Vizio has had some really good picture quality/bang-for-buck reviews.  Its not as good as you'll get from Samsung or even Sony/Panny/Sharp, but some models are getting very respectable comments.  You have to research each model though on its own merit.<br>  <br>  Based on your budget, I would recommend Sony Bravia KDL-32L4000.  It MSPRs slightly higher than your budget, but most places sell under MSRP, so I think you can snag it towards the limit of your budget.  You might just need to dig around and find a place that has it for the price you can tolerate.<br>  <br>  If that just won't work budget wise, then maybe look out for the Vizio VW32LHDTV.  Its not quite as strong as the Sony, but does rate okay.  Its MSRP is around $450, so you should find it cheaper than that.|`|2taQ2htJaa	You might have a hard time finding a 32" for under $500 if you want high def. <br>  They are best used with High Definition tv stations, sports channels, BlueRay, etc. 720p and 1080p relate to the number of pixels in a HDTV. 1080p is has a higher pixel count than 720p, but with a 32" TV, people claim there isn't a noticable difference (but a $100+ cost increase) <br>  <br>  Sony's may be a good brand, but they are notoriously expensive. If you want to compare TV's, check out cnet.com. They have really good reviews about TV quality and price comparison info.<br>  <br>  For what you're going to use it for, however, you should probably go for standard definition. It would be a lot cheaper.<br>  <br>  As for brands, Samsung, Panasonic and Vizio are highly rated on cnet. Also, you can find a 32" High def vizio at walmart's website for ~$450 right now.|`|ebhu7ABvaa	At that size, I'd go with sony or samsung lcd. LCD is great for viewing in a room with a lot of natural light. Plasma is best for bigger size screen (46" and up) and tends to have a little better picture overall. Smoother motion. High Definition is a higher quality of broadcasting...better picture and sound. All cable provider now offer many HD channels (but not all HD, certain channels...it varies). 1080p means it has more lines of resolution than 720p, which will give a clearer picture. Cable does not currently broadcast in full HD (1080p), but blu-ray dvds are 1080p and xbox.<br>  <br>  If it's for the bedroom and around 32", go with LCD. I'd go with this Sony below. Great picture, sharp and colors are very accurate. Worth the price. With Sony, it's best to go with their XBR tv's (like the one below) :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8804911&type=product&id=1206141948451" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  If you NEED to stay closer to $500...this Sony is great too (it's 720p, not 1080p like above):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9222646&type=product&id=1218062424206" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  Stay away from Dynex, Westinghouse.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Kl7DTuDraa	ok if i were you i would go for a lcd since its in a bedroom because plasmas may have a more crisp picture but they have alot of glare while lcd dosent have glare and since its just a 32' you dont realy need 1080p wich is just more pixels in the picture gives you a more detailed picture 720p is more than good enough for dvds and whatching tv and its also easier on the wallet and sony is the best company usualy for lcd stay away from walmart brands hoped i could help|`|ZKVGoP9Iaa	look for sony|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I would recommend Samsung brand for good quality and great picture.I suggest Samsung LN32A450 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV but a little bit higher than your budget.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141AYIC?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00141AYIC" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141A...</a>

Once u get it, u can go to the connection settings at the ds's main menu and follow the steps it gives u to set up a connection.

Using this type of battery provides you with a lot more power than ordinary batteries. And also, you are not wasting your money because when they drain, you recharge them instead of throwing them away.|`|eUWBpSCwaa	i have a digicam too and it ran out of batteries very fast , until i figured out that i shouldnt follow the instructions. manual told me not to overcharge it, and i did, i was surprised that it last very very long, actually almost the whole day(yeah im using it, tking photos and videos too)<br>  <br>  just to infrom u my battery is not the cylinder type, its like d square battery of a cellphone.<br>  and my cam is Pentax Optio W20<br>  <br>  honestly, i dont like those cylinder type batteries, they ranout so fast in devices like that. :D

RxB0ivXoaa	The Olympus E-420 would be an excellent choice for a first camera. The E-420 is the smallest and lightest DSLR available today. Coupled with the 25mm pancake lens, it's not any larger than some point and shoot cameras. The quality is superb, just as good as any other DSLR you'll be looking at. You could easily print high quality posters from you pics. And you'll get features the others don't offer in entry level cameras. Features like auto focus, live view and image stabilization (in the body so it works with any lens). Olympus cameras are the choice for Pulitzer Prize winners and have had images featured on the cover of National Geographic. All these features and quality for well under $700, leaving you money for other things.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	If you want good DSLR , for your budget I suggest Nikon D80 10.2MP  with 18-135mm AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HGIWN4?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000HGIWN4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HGI...</a><br>  <br>  or Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA85A?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0012YA85A" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA...</a><br>  <br>  but if you want to replace for a year save your money and get Nikon D40 ,great camera with only $410.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ1DG?ie=UTF8&tag=yk-1-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KJQ1DG" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ...</a>|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28.

You can get Great pictures with two megapixels. My friend won an away with a 1.3 megapixel camera. That should tell you something. <br>  <br>  I know you are being thrown around here with answers, but i think the Canon Rebel XSI/450d is a great camera, it's much better than the D60. Larger screen, and live view of course.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digital-18-55mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B0012OGF6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1235100021&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-10-2MP-Digit...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjHfqvlDR5o" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjHfqvlDR...</a>|`|i5OVORXgaa	I recommend the Canon Rebel XT and Nikon D40.|`|d55HYaktaa	D40 with 18-55mm + SB-400 + 55-200mm VR|`|1dMDPypLaa	Everybody says the Nikon D60 is a good beginner camera, and I know that from experience. I just got mines a few months ago as my first DSLR camera, and its really basic and simple. Excellent quality too. 10.2 megapixels|`|DgWUovrQaa	Top 10 Digital SLR Cameras:|`|jYMUzFRzaa	Get a used XTi body and spend the rest on decent glass.
tjg7hLbMaa	Phones sold in the USA through mobile phone companies are locked to a particular network. This way, they basically force you to use their services.<br>  <br>  If you do purchase a T-Mobile phone, you will need to get it unlocked. Some stores and online places offer this service but it will be at a cost. Costs really differ depending on who you go through (and the type of phone) so it's best to find that information out before purchasing.<br>  <br>  Sprint is not compatible with AT&T's networks so stay away from them.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is to look around on some websites and purchase the phone from a 3rd party retailer (where the phone has already been unlocked).|`|4cMuedpWaa	You cannot use phones from Sprint with your AT&T.<br>  <br>  You can with T-Mobile but its phone lineup sucks big time.<br>  <br>  There are VERY good qwerty phones in the AT&T lineup:<br>  <br>  HTC Touch Pro (FUZE)<br>  All Blackberry Curve have the best qwerty keyboards in the world.<br>  <br>  Samsung Blackjack II has an awesome keyboard.<br>  <br>  As you can see, way more and better choice than T-Mobile and/or Sprint.|`|0db5faa7f74addd4a881c564a626715eaa	Get it unlocked I guess. It'll cost more money for the device but you'll be able to use it on your network.|`|N3OuAcx3aa	Yes , you can use a sim card which is only compatible with quad-band phones, but most phones are that. they might be more expensive but if you keep the phone in good shape it will also sell for more when you're ready to get rid of it
YCUFMajMaa	D: OH NOES! DON'T DO IT! ;_; *sniff.sniff*|`|TPqIYqWCaa	tif you click reset network settings it will not auto connect to networks you use all the time and it will make google your default search engine it restarts the ipod but no music or anything gets deleted they may not even notice|`|0UgVTdpWaa	No. It will delete all of the Wi-Fi points you have connected too.
UtHnh0aHaa	If you need a source, you must state the country in which you live so that the answer can be semi useful. This is a world wide forum.<br>  <br>  If you live in Ontario Canada, I know of a place that handles unclaimed or salvaged freight at about 20 cents on the dollar.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
AA11739592	I use CopyTrans but it can only take 100 songs at a time.       try it it might be good for you.    copytrans basically just copies the music you choose off your ipod and pastes it onto your hard drive.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	This is interesting and have had mi Ipod for 3 years and never knew how to do this. Somebody please reply? =]|`|XJSOToRGaa	If you have downloaded songs to your playlist it should, by default, also be a part of your library.  If it somehow isn't, you can click and drag in itunes to add it to your library.  Then, connect the new ipod, set it to synch the same playlist as the old ipod and voila.|`|ioVIAewjaa	Use Yamipod  it's a free standalone software that takes your ipod music and puts it back on your comp in a playlist. I used it when my computer crashed and it worked so well!  Use it, and when you plug your new ipod in you can put the music in your itunes.
AA11739592	i would try http://megaupload.com/ or just google "transfer files online" or "host files online" (without the quotes) or http://mediafire.com/
