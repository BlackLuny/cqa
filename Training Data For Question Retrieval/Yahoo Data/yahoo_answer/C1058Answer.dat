zI6cZoAWaa	it is not too late. a fighter named "hasim rahman" started training boxing at the age of 20. he went on to become world champion and knock out lennox lewis.|`|kaoTvcZqaa	Bob, haha I didn't even catch him saying "play boxing" That's funny!<br>  <br>  It's not too late, but the highest level would be professional boxing...that might be very difficult to accomplish.<br>  <br>  Just get to a gym and do work|`|U91xlYS8aa	umm u can start at any age its never too late<br>  and u dont play boxing u train boxing|`|AVTXclXqaa	DONT EVER YOUR PATHETIC LIFE SAY "play boxing". You dont play boxing. You play soccer, basketball, and football but if you try to play around in the ring your gonna get knocked out. And to answer your question, NO its not too late just find a boxing gym in your area and start training hard and in a few months you can fight as in amatuer.

The offering club retains exclusive negotiating rights and other clubs cannot negotiate with exclusive franchise players.<br>  <br>  A non-exclusive franchise player is offered a one-year contract for an amount no less than the average of the top five salaries at his position in the 2008 season, or a 20 percent salary increase, whichever is greater. The offering club does not hold exclusive negotiating rights, and the player can negotiate with other clubs. The original club may match any offer to retain the player, or receive two first-round draft choices as compensation if it elects not to match. The signing period for non-exclusive franchise players is from Feb. 27 through July 15. Clubs have until July 15 to sign franchise players to a multi-year contract or extension. After this date the player may only sign a one-year tender for the next season.<br>  <br>  Clubs may designate a transition player by offering a one-year contract for an amount no less than the average of the top 10 salaries of 2008 at the player's position, or a 20 percent salary increase, whichever is greater. A transition player designation gives the club a first-refusal right to match an offer sheet within seven days given to the player by another club. If the offering club does not match the offer sheet, it receives no compensation. Transition players can be signed from Feb. 27 to July 22.<br>  <br>  I got that from the NFL web site.

It's just like a baby. They need diapers for the first few years of their lives, then when they mature then don't need the support. That's exactly how the Rockets are. A few seasons ago they had to depend on McGrady and couldn't win a game without him. Now they learned to adapt without him. That's good I'm proud of the Rockets. We are 17-6 without McGrady. I'm also sad that McGrady isn't playing but hey when your'e closer to winning that title you won't be thinking about it until after you hold up that trophy.<br>  <br>  GO ROCKETS!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12221556	I'm a cavs fan.

giWvSwqRaa	Looks help since tennis is a form of entertainment but you still have to be a good player. For example I am a fan of Maria Sharapova because she look good and play well. I don't care much for people like Anna Kournikova because she get by with look alone.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Well I barely pay attention to womens tennis, But if 2 people i dont know are playing, i'll want the better looking won to win. And If there really ugly i dont like them, like Dinara Safina. But it all doesn't matter to me because i rarely watch womens tennis and dont care for it too much compared to the guys tennis. Guys playing are a lot more entertaining to me.|`|hCLmczgMaa	I think many fans including myself base players on their looks. Reason being is that you have something to look at. Personally I wouldn't want to be a fan of a butt ugly chick who is average. For example: in woman's tennis it is hawtness but decency. I am not a Jankovic fan because she isnt attractive to me. For men I guess Safin is a good looking guy so girls like him... There are looks everywhere being used in sports. take a look at david bekam and his fans... <br>  <br>  so u need to be good but if u have the charm and are decent u will make it. if u r #2 and good looking and #1 is ugly then #2 has more fans...|`|1w5blbobaa	Well I totally agree with u,there are lotssss of fricks who got impressed by their looks & don't really watch there performance.<br>  <br>  Honestly I hv never had this bad habit(if I can say it as habit),I think performance matters 2 me the most.Okk let me tell u a lil secret,initially I don't use 2 like Rafa as much as I do now, & the main reason behind that is HIS GAME....<br>  So looks are minority for me at least,IT can attract u initially bt it's the game that matters.<br>  <br>  NICE QUES though.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|3a6823ce91c7f2901ad691610e4ab870aa	personally, yes, the way a tennis player looks DOES affect the way i feel about them.  it's human nature!  we are all constantly sizing people up based on the way they look, whether we are conscious of it or not.  but how the player looks is not the only factor that affects the way i feel about a player.  <br>  <br>  for example, i don't find nadal attractive AT ALL.  and i only find federer mildly attractive.  but they way they play tennis more than makes up for their lack of "hotness" for me.   (the female equivalent of this would probably be henin.)<br>  <br>  on the other hand, f. lopez is not exactly the greatest player in the world, but i find him very attractive, so i do tend to root for him even when he is up against better but not so great looking players, such as monfils.   (men might tend to root for hantuchova for this reason?)<br>  <br>  speaking of monfils, he is highly ranked but he is unattractive enough for me to not want to look at him for more than 3 minutes, so i NEVER root for him despite his tennis skills.  (bartoli or jankovic might be a good example.)<br>  <br>  now djokovic is both good looking and a great player but i don't care much for his arrogance abd his tendency to retire from matches.  in this case, his bad attitude far outweighs his good qualities, so i always tend to root AGAINST him.  (sharapova fits this bill.  in her case, she's pretty and a strong player, but she seems cold and unfriendly.)<br>  <br>  i guess it's really a more complicated question than it seems.  i'm guessing my thought process in deciding who i root for is not unique.  looks matter, but so many other things factor in as well.|`|o2WdAKZbaa	Most people probably won't admit it but it's like anything else in life. People are attracted to what they consider attractive. I would much rather watch a match between Ana Ivanovic and Elena Dementieva than between Carla Suarez Navarro and Patty Schnyder anytime. But I will say that my favorite match to watch is between Serena and Venus not because of there looks but because of there talent. I would also rather watch Marat Safin vs Andy Roddick over Radek Stepanek vs Gael Monfils and that doesn't make me gay it's just easier on the eyes.    :-)~|`|KReWaGFsaa	Well, not really.. it's just a minor factor to me. What matters most is how they play tennis. And also their personalities.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't like it when people say they are a fan of so-and-so just because they're "hot", "gorgeous", "cute", etc. Like seriously.<br>  There's nothing wrong with liking a good-looking player, as long as you like their performance too..|`|Aqku2AXJaa	i see your point, i did the same thing in aussie open last year when i first saw ana ivanovic, but i actually followed her last year even though she is in a terrible form slump.|`|s7l6oZANaa	i kinda do both.. like my fav guy players there hot!((gilles simon..marat safin..and andy roddick))  but there also awesome tennis players aswell..|`|B46t8gkLaa	i'm that with female tennis players. kinda sad really..|`|GNq2rmrNaa	it doesn't affect me at all|`|D1NWb2mfaa	I'm thinking I am similar to you.  I love to watch the WTA as much as I like the ATP, however, the WTA frustrates me as they do not have a stand-out definitive #1 star.  At least, not one that can hold a #1 ranking very long.<br>  But my favorites are (to me) all hotties!  Ana Ivanovic, Maria Sharapova, Elena Dementieva, Elena Vesnina, et.al.<br>  All of these girls hit with power!  Awesome!<br>  If I see a new hottie, I am also like "ooooh", who's that?  But, unlike you, if it turns out that that "hottie" is an arrogant beyatch....I still like to watch her!  I don't particularly like Marion Bartoli (#14), nor do I like Serena!<br>  <br>  Even though I respect the ATP members' skill levels, I don't like the unattractive ones (to me, ugly); like Radek Stepanek (#16).<br>  <br>  So, yes, it does play a part in my deciding for whom I will root.  But only in the beginning.  I totally DISLIKE male arrogance, chest thumping, in-your-face attitudes!|`|NDbx9CSvaa	I'm a guy and I hardly care about womens tennis. Mens tennis is way more competitive so that's what interests me more. Since I don't care much about womens tennis, looks don't matter much there. I was rooting for Jankovic at the US Open and for Serena at the Aussie open. When Justine was around I was a big fan of hers and rooted for her always.<br>  <br>  However it seems that looks are too important for a lot of women around here. Some women seem to love Roddick and/or Safin and seem to hate Murray since they claim he is arrogant. From what angle are Safin and Roddick not arrogant and especially Safin? The guy whines almost every match he's losing and ruins a racquet or 2 along the way as well. It's kind of obvious the girls hate Murray purely due to his looks (and his teeth). They find him unattractive so that's why they hate him.|`|nIBop2doaa	Definitely I mean if Roger Federer was ugly he probably wouldn't be my favorite tennis player. But, ya if I'm watching a girls match I'll probably go for the one that is more hot.|`|yAA5NpiDaa	hey ...... great players are famous and the camera always around them so they care about their look and they're always terrific in and out the court.|`|e5o872xpaa	I agree with u COOKIE nice thought|`|hRoR7AY8aa	i don't really care what a tennis player look likes i like them more if they have a genuine likeable personality and are not stereotypical player, for instance many people love Ana Ivanovic because she is a beautiful, stereotypical hard hitter, this and because she of her complete lack of respect for her opponent led to me knowing her only as Ana Ivanobitch.<br>  <br>  My favourite tennis player in the entire world, Marion Bartoli, is generally not well liked. this is probably because your general "sharapova" or "ivanovic", and to be honest she is not the prettiest girl on the tour (not that she is ugly). i like her because she has a genuine honest personality, lots of talent and her unorthodox-icity make her a very enjoyable player to watch and these are the things that should make a tennis player likeable, not there looks.<br>  <br>  Edit: I am super surprised with everyone's answers i really didn't expect that this many people only like player because of the looks, as far as im concerned that should hardly play a part, i though people would actually enjoy watching tennis for the tennis again i am so surprised, well i guess not many people share my views =(|`|lOGONZSVaa	for me a rather like an average tennis female player which performs exceptionally!! Most ov the time those average looking players are simple, noble, and modest people! <br>  It is those kind ov personalities that make them grow into top and famous players!!<br>  not having looks as a sportman or women gets u dealing with more important things such as your next tournament, having looks its like"men a gotta look nice today! each time a hit a ball, agotta having a smile for the camera!" ask sharapova, kounikova, they can answer that 4 u!<br>  but yeah, a can say that looks can play a role in jugding a player but thats always at first sight! not afta not lata!<br>  the simpler you are the better people appreciate you! Ask justin henin and venus and Yannick Noah! they can answer that 4 u!!!

Have you seen the Cavs record?? Obviously, you haven't because if you had, you would have to know that they have beaten MANY Western Conference teams. Why are people counting Cleveland out because of one game?? Have you seen their record??|`|H1VIZsutaa	Some people have bad nights. The Rockets aren't that good because of all of the injuries. I mean, the Clippers beat the Celtics!<br>  <br>  The west isn't that deep besides the Lakers and the Spurs. The balance of power is switching over to the East. Phoenix and Dallas are both to old. New Orleans, Utah are having average seasons. The only other possible contender is the Nuggets.<br>  <br>  I think if the Cavs, Celtics, or (maybe) the Magic go to the finals they will win.<br>  <br>  I can see the Cave, Celtics over the Lakers and the Spurs. If the Magic get hot behind the arc, they are almost unstoppable.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	No. It just showed the Cavs had a bad game<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember the Lakers lost against the Pacers in LA!<br>  Boston also has lost against worse teams than the Rockets in Boston.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Yea so it was a bad game for the Cavs and LBJ had a bad night. Did you see how good he was performing before tonight. I don't think tonight's stats from LBj will dramtically affect his seson average.|`|TNN6U75Maa	Off night. They have 3 more tough games on the road. We'll see what they are made of now.<br>  <br>  <br>  DG_FTW|`|qxCUY7cJaa	Go CAVS!: Consider your last win to be a bogus one. Did you know why Yao Ming said "See you in Houston" in that game? Many of those so called "fouls" were phantom and you know it. Today, there was none of that bullshit. With no referee bias towards Yao, he was able to destroy the Cavaliers easily.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	The West is having a down year......Eastern Conference is legit...<br>  <br>  Only one team in the East has won less than 23 games.......Wizards<br>  <br>  SIX teams in the West have 20 or less wins <br>  <br>  East: 3 teams with 40+ Wins<br>  West: 1 team with 40+ Wins

khU8m4gxaa	God I hope not. If it's to turn West into a heel manager & then to bring in a halfway decent announcer to team with Tenay to replace him, then I'm fine with it. West could be good in that role. As long as they don't book West vs. Tenay in the ring.|`|aXdGCbEDaa	Yup,I'm guessing thats gonna get the award for worst feud of the year.Hell,it would be classic if TNA threw Mike Adamle in there.I'm guessing that it's a sign of desperation from TNA.Honestly,Russo has run that place down,just like he did WCW.TNA was great the first 2 or 3 years.I thought that it was going to run WWE out of bussiness,right now,it's the other way around.TNA is today's WCW.|`|5hrl5Dq1aa	I think they are just having the good commentator and the bad commentator ie the heel and face of commentary. I hope that is the case. However much people dislike Don West I still like him. It would be good to have someone siding with the heels and someone siding with the faces|`|Kecfbgm5aa	yes actually i like the fact that tna personnel like jeremy borash, lauren, tenay, and west have personality and real "feelings" with those ppl on tv. but they r copying an old wwf feud between jr and king.|`|QrbwYLaIaa	mike tenay is way better let them fightmicrophone on a pole match|`|znqX7je0aa	lol...mike tenay joins mafia<br>  don west joins frontline|`|7DzgOx4haa	Yes, but I don't know who the hell would want to see that
PqmmyV6baa	Of course were better without T-Mac. Our ball movement is better, and were scoring more. The Rockets are actually starting to feel the chemistry between each other at the right time too. The Rockets are 17-6 without McGrady their so called All Star. What ever. I think the Rockets should just trade him and save theirselves 20 million dollars. Now the Rockets are on their 6 game winning streak. <br>  <br>  GO ROCKETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|UBIlwiALaa	Think so, that is why they were going to try to trade him to New Jersey but with his injury the deal didn't go through.  When Yao plays like he did tonight, they are tough to beat.  How about the stuff Yao did with LB try to block it.  LB makes Ron Artest (one of the strongest players in NBA) look small in comparision.|`|qxCUY7cJaa	When McLazy was playing, he always hogged the ball and never moved.  Rockets are now more efficient on both offense and defense without McLazy, because now they have more ball movement and people running the court.|`|GERlmBIUaa	With a healthy tmac no... but with an injured one yes cuz their offense is slower but with him healthy or without em they have a fast paced offense... best answer plz|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah easily they are actually gonna get past the first round this year.<br>  And Lakers will win.|`|c65414e6d7b132c02e2235a82cf49555aa	Rockets are better without T-Mac, cause he rarely plays due to injury|`|iEbl30suaa	Por supuesto, T-Mac tiene una fractura de pene.|`|uxregJ0faa	Of course. Tmac's injured self slowed them down. He should play when he is healthy. I saw this pattern early in the season when Tmac was out a couple of weeks.|`|xQgciq09aa	T-Mac may have worn out his welcome in Houston.<br>  <br>  Ron Artest is a much better defender and a very good shooter as well, so maybe they are better off.<br>  <br>  I just wish they could have traded him for a backup center if they are not going to keep him.|`|jjjgcuduaa	The Rockets are far better off without an injured McGrady. However, if McGrady recovers fro mhis surgery, they will be better. The Rockets need a 100% healthy McGrady in order to compete for a championship, I don't see them contending for one now<br>  <br>  The Rockets + Injured McGrady = Playoff Contender<br>  The Rockets + 100% Healthy McGrady = Championship Contender|`|kKbqdlbnaa	Definitely. T-mac is a ballstopper who refuses to adapt to the Adelman offense, and there is nothing he does on the court now that improves us. His time in Houston is done. He's gone the next chance the Rockets get to pick up some valuable players for his expiring contract.|`|qzW2Z5Fgaa	Yeah i think so....<br>  <br>  Please answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjtFPZ79ydr8i3rs.h5V8m7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226193346AAm0BbX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Yes, you could say that.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ Suns

g6XJzyGqaa	The main thing you want to do is be able to jockey a man away from the goal. This will give your teammates time to get back as well as forcing him to potentially slip up so you can make the tackle easy. When you get the ball playing it forward isnt always the best idea if everyone is marked look to pass to another defender or the goalkeeper even but make sure it wont get intercepted. Also always be giving an option for the midfielders when they have the ball so they can pass it back to you this will allow your team to open up the field more and allow alot more space to play the ball. Theres alot more to learn but this should help.|`|AA12200025	U must be clever and concentrate to what u want to do.
fKAnnQeWaa	How did I know it was you Pedro. Once I saw Tito instead of David I knew it was you lol. Anyways, welcome to my domain hehe.<br>  <br>  Let's compare them by stats.<br>  <br>  Usually, the stat you use for clutch would be GIDP's (Double Plays).<br>  <br>  David Ortiz has a seasonal average of 13 GIDP's per season (108/12)<br>  <br>  Alex Rodriguez has an averages 15 GIDP's per season (189/15)<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if I did that correctly, but by GIDP's Ortiz is the better clutch hitter.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Tito Ortiz is a mma fighter, so I will go with A-Rod. If you mean David Ortiz, I will go the David Ortiz over A-Rod.|`|d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	neither its Jeter|`|EVW2Wwmcaa	bobby abrue  lol|`|E6fCMC3maa	id say A rod<br>  hes got more experiance so id have to go with him|`|fe56d27a01fe95275a72aee2ba4937cdaa	Tito Ortiz, he'd pound a-rod. LOL|`|d6ec95dd1a8722f1804a8af629c51c1eaa	I would go with David "Big Pappi" Ortiz, considering A-Roid does not produce after the 7th inning!|`|pX4z9Qg0aa	Tito|`|5pK4LjMfaa	well the best clutch hitter in the game is David Ortiz because he can always produce|`|I683b5E8aa	MANNY RAMIREZ AND DEREK JETER|`|Hjwyb3vgaa	Ortiz gay-rod sucks|`|jwfb88v0aa	a-rod cause he's got juice lol

You add up all the Runs Allowed, which gives you 16, and you multiply by 9. Then you would have 144. Finally, divide the R*9(144) by the IP (25) and you get the ERA vs the whole team which is 5.76. There, happy?<br>  <br>  Zambrano will be facing the Yankees for the 3rd time in his career. He, like Sabathia, has not had much success versus the rival team. He has a 8.18 ERA in 12.1 Innings Pitched versus the New York Yankees.<br>  <br>  This game is going to come down to what team's pitching can hold off the offenses the longest. Only time will tell the winner!

giWvSwqRaa	It depend on how big you want your grip. I recommend just use one roll then see how it feel before you decide to put on the other roll.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	No, 1 roll is for 1 grip. So you have 3 grips there, you only use one to regrip your racquet|`|ktqnO4wHaa	You only use one grip at a time, it is hard to put one on for your first time so look it up on youtube or something.<br>  <br>  Man if you find a big bag of red sour skittles tell me! I've been looking for those forever =P|`|NBT5PoRVaa	oh man. you should have someone else show you how to grip your racquet for the first time.<br>  if no one else knows then you just get the grip. start at the bottom of the grip (many grips have little sticky parts to help start it). Then follow the same direction as the undergrip is. make sure it is somewhat tight and make sure you don't overlap too much. if you do it right you will probably either finish with no grip left over or just a little bit. if there is a bit of the tape left over just rip it off or cut it. now get the little sticker thing that game with it and tape it around the overgrip so that it holds it down.|`|lEH7Xkb9aa	Man I've been looking everywhere for big bags of sour skittles. If its overgrip just put on whatever feels comfortable. If its an actual replacement grip you only use one.|`|dac40c900160ab9700d5d99256e01ca6aa	just use one, its probably a pkt of 3|`|lOGONZSVaa	Nop use one roll at a time!<br>  3 rolls will make the handle thick and uncomfortable to play with!!!

AA11643636	In order for Marbury "to bury" if you will his sins of the past he has to become a team player.  He should know that he won't start in Boston so coming off the bench will be his role on this team.  He has veteran players that will look to him for support when they aren't in the game.  And will have to do the right things to gain their trust and support.<br>  <br>  If he wants another contract (And he will after this season) he will have to show that he can play a supporting role rather than the lead and be happy about it...not content...happy.<br>  <br>  Rondo needs a backup...badly.  The bench needs a boost, and so does this team.  And most importantly the city of Boston for this team.<br>  <br>  Marbury needs to become a role player.  Something that he has been either unwilling or unable to do.  He has been for the most part... a loser...going to the playoffs only twice in his twelve year career.<br>  <br>  He has the skills and basketball ability to play both the point and the two, however his mental capability to blend that into a way to win games has escaped him.  <br>  <br>  There is no turning back for him.  He has to finally become what he has problems with becoming the most...a true basketball player.|`|4XjDbTZFaa	he will take eddie house's place, overall Marbury will play a major role in second unit. He went from a Knick to now getting the chance to get a championship ring. Plus Kevin Garnett and Marbury have a lot of chemstry, ever since they played in Minnesota|`|f3DYQgzUaa	He will help and be happy since he will be with KG|`|HNQU9V6Haa	he will be fine|`|m05HJc1Paa	He'll probably help, the Celtics need more scoring from the bench.  But if he does become a problem, they can just let him go.|`|X5kJpC0zaa	to tell the truth i think he will have th sam eimpact on the celtics as allen iverson is having on the pistons|`|H1VIZsutaa	He has to help them. If "Starbury" doesn't preform in Boston or causes problems, they will release him. It's not like they desperately need him. The team is to good and would be fine without him.<br>  <br>  He might give them 9 or 10 a night and a couple of assists. I think he will be a good addition to Boston.|`|JazMdYHFaa	he ll make the team a lot better<br>  hes amazing

A third option is to cheer for your second favorite NBA team if it's not Portland.<br>  <br>  I may have been to one Storm game and two Sonics games in my life at the Key Arena, but the funnest thing is that one of the former Sonics, Detlef Schrempf, played high school ball at Centralia and brought it to the 1981 state championship.

YE87HP26aa	It is unlikely that anyone here has biked across north america; it will be a heck of a lot easier to bike across the US, except for the northern areas and the mountains, it will be warmer, you will have more access to bike shop (for major repairs), it will be more comfortable, and there easier roads and routes.<br>  <br>  This is something major; you really have to know what you are getting into; it's not like you will have a fun joy ride(at least not all the time), some days you will be so tired that you will wonder why the heck you went; others you will feel so good that you wonder why you didn't go years ago.<br>  You will also need new, well built equipment.<br>  <br>  I can help you plan for this so give me an email at: kyle2593@juno.com|`|AA11056614	You really just have to look at a map ... Canada is much wider than the US (although it depends where you cycle from/to). Furthermore, the selection of roads across Canada is more limited (and stores/campgrounds/restaurants will be similarly less available) , so even though riding across Canada is practical (many riders do it each year) you are forced onto busy highways in much of the country.<br>  <br>  I suggest that for a variety of reasons it would be a tougher exercise to do Canada coast to coast than the US. ... and neither is a trivial exercise.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Interesting question.

Georgia to Upstate NY. It took about 10 days, although I probably could have done it a couple days quicker if I pushed myself. <br>  <br>  I traveled fairly light, just some extra clothes. I stayed in motels along the way; after being in the saddle all day, sleeping in a tent on the ground didn't seem like much fun. I didn't plan my route ahead of time, I just had a map and checked it each day before I got started so I had a general idea of which way to go. I only had 1 serious mechanical on the trip. My rear derailleur failed, but there was a bike shop nearby and they fixed me up and sent me on my way. Other than that, flat tires were the only other repairs I had to do.<br>  <br>  I had 1 really bad day on the road. I was on the Blue Ridge Parkway and it was cold and rainy all day. I didn't realize it at the time, but there's nothing on that road except scenery. I had nothing to eat all day, just some water at a ranger station. By the time I found a hotel at the end of the day, I was probably borderline hypothermic. But I took a long hot shower and was back on the road the next day. <br>  <br>  As long as your bike is in good mechanical condition and you've trained enough, you should be OK. My trip was before the days of cell phones, but it would be a good idea to bring one.

Y4mz8BShaa	G21/G21C.<br>  A .45 ACP doubletap is controllable and extremely effective.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Don't own one, but the 10mm model has the most. Either that or .45 (which is more common).|`|xE6WXVIeaa	Accorcing to research done by the military for the Navy Seals etc. when they were looking to replace the venerable 1911, it's not the calibre but shot placement that matters most. Get a Glock that is easy for you to handle and shoot accurately and don't worry so much about the size of the bullet. As for bullet type, hollow points or other expanding rounds transfer energy to the target more effectively than full metal jacket type rounds.|`|XUydeuhKaa	I agree with shadowonthesun.<br>  It doesn't matter the size of the bullet. It is all about bullet placement!!! <br>  You can stop a threat or may have to use deadly force just as good with a .22LR cal and a .45cal. You do want to get a gun that fits your hand just right, everything from when you hold it to when you shoot it, it should feel natural, like you have 100% control. If you're looking something to conceal and carry, go to your local gun store and ask if they have a Glock model 19, its a 9mm. It's the size between a model 26 and model 17. Some stores that has ranges will even let you try it out and shoot it first. I usually carry my 26 or 19, which are both 9mm, for concealment. I also have a Glock 22 that's a .40cal, and I have never carried it. So to sum this up, if you want stopping power, focus on bullet placement, start from the groin and follow straight up.

OAEuYZkZaa	Hunting shotguns have barrels in the 24" to 28" range, and sometimes much longer, with either fixed or screw-in chokes.<br>  <br>  Shotguns intended for defensive use have short barrels.  The legal minimum length is 18" but nearly all manufacturers use 18.5" as their standard to make sure the overall length is at least 26"<br>  <br>  If you are going to buy a firearm for home defense, you'd damned well better learn to use it and how to hit what you want to shoot before an intruder breaks into your home.<br>  <br>  You've probably been told that you don't have to aim a shotgun, just point it in the general direction, pull the trigger and mow down everything in a ten foot wide swath.  That is a bunch or horse manure!  At inside the house ranges the spread of shot can be covered by an average palm, about 4".  If you don't point the gun where you want the shot to go, you WILL miss your target.<br>  <br>  You've probably also heard people say that you should use #8 birdshot in your home defense shotgun.  Sure it you manage to hit an intruder with an ounce or ounce and a half of #8 shot you will stagger him, and if he is lightly dressed you will make a nasty shallow surface wound.  If he's wearing a heavy coat you might not even do that.  A pellet of #8 shot weighs 2 grains, it would take 3500 of them to make a pound.  Such a light pellet lacks the mass to penetrate the vital organs which can cause a lethal or incapacitating wound.  Use buckshot for home defense.  00 (pronounced "double-ought") buckshot is probably the very best performer, but it also has enough weight to penetrate walls.  I'd recommend 0 ("single-ought) Buckshot or #1 Buckshot, these have the necessary mass to penetrate a human body but are less likely to penetrate drywall than 00.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you purchase a 12 gauge Mossberg Model 500 pump shotgun with two barrels, a 26" screw-choke barrel for bird hunting and sporting clays and an 18'5" barrel for things that go bump in the night.<br>  <br>  I also highly recommend that you take a Hunter Safety Education Course and join a local sporting clays club so you can learn to handle your shotgun properly.<br>  <br>  congratulations on choosing not to be a victim.<br>  <br>  Good Shooting,<br>  Doc|`|YrxLbfiIaa	You want a Mossberg 500 12 gauge.......<br>  <br>  One of these.......<br>  <br>  Mossberg 500 18 inch barrel 12 gauge 6 shot catalog # 50411....<br>  <a href="http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_Guns/930/NEW/50411.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_...</a><br>  <br>  OR -----<br>  Mossberg 500 20 inch barrel 12 gauge 8 shot catalog # 50577.....<br>  <a href="http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_Guns/930/NEW/50577.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_...</a><br>  <br>  Yes Mossberg makes a ton of similar models but avoid...

The barrel has been shortened to allow manueverability in tight quarters.

First let's set forth a few "definitions".<br>  <br>  Defense Shotgun:  Designed for Close Quarters Combat (CQB) meaning inside a house.  It will have a minimum length barrel (18") and most likely a pistol grip or collapsible stock.  This makes it easier to maneuver around corners and down hallways with the weapon in the ready aim position.<br>  <br>  Hunting shotgun: Longer barrel usually with a choke adapter for different uses.  Also usually has a longer barrel (26 inches and up).  A choke could also be called a concentrator as it restricts the shot and concentrates the pattern for longer shots such as turkey or squirrel hunting or allows for wider dispersal in the case of bird hunting or skeet shooting. <br>  <br>  There is also a rifled slug shotgun that shoots sabot slug rounds via a rifled barrel for longer range shotgun hunting of medium or large game.  The barrels on these weapons does not have a choke.<br>  <br>  A good compromise is to get a 20-inch barrel with an interchangeable choke tube for all around use.  You can also get one and then buy additional barrels later.  All you do is remove a screw cap, remove one barrel, put on the other and screw back on.<br>  <br>  As far as good weapons on the cheap.  The Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 are virtually identical with the exception of the location of the safety and the slide release.  Whichever one fits your hand better is good enough.  The Remington will be a few dollars more than the Mossy.  Also, if you like the Remington, check out the 870 clones hitting the market by Norinco and IAC.  They are half the price and just as good as the Remy...they are just made in China but are only 18-inch barrels.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Mossberg and Remington are both good choices, as cops will be able to tell you.<br>  A "defense" shotgun is frequently on which has an extended magazine.  You'd need to plug it for hunting purposes.<br>  You could also go with the Maverick line.  They're a lower-end Mossberg, and most of the accessories will fit.

If you are not planning to take part in an extended gunfight expending several hundred rounds, you really don't need a heat shield.<br>  <br>  Let me suggest that you save yourself some money.  Just go into a sporting goods store and purchase a standard 12 gauge Mossberg M-500, preferably one with a 26" barrel with screw-in chokes.  Then spend a little more money and buy an 18.5" cylinder bored barrel.

I think PING is one of the best.  AFter two - three years you can graduate to a more "feel" type club.  When you feel the Pings are flying too high or too far ... then you will know it's time for a change.  <br>  <br>  Work on Control and just meeting the Clubface with the ball.  Don't "keep your head down", but just move it naturally with your swing.  Keep it free and comfortable.

Maybe you are looking at a very specific shot you are hitting, but in the scheme of thing I agree with the other answer.  Spin is not as important as the technique you use to impart the spin.

I live in Vancouver and it would be like a 4 hour drive there. <br>  <br>  Secondly, i definetly think Nogueira will accept. He never turns down a fight. Unless hes injured or has other plans i don't see him turning this fight down.<br>  <br>  As to who wins. Its an extremely tough call. I'm gonna say Couture by split decision. I think couture would out wrestle him and would win standup as well. Nog has incredible jits and ground game so its possible could end in a submission for nog. But overall i think couture would win.|`|lJJsKvunaa	Tough call.<br>  <br>  I got Randy by TKO, simply because I don't see Nog out-striking Randy after seeing him against Mir and seeing how sharp Randy has looked standing for the past few fights.<br>  And I don't see Nog submitting Randy, or pounding him out. <br>  That pretty much leaves Randy to do his thing.|`|qSKsEL1Oaa	i have nog. screw randy. never liked him. and he ducked nog before so hopefully nog will make him pay.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Tough call.

Ui2WJH4Iaa	heavier bullet equals deeper penetration in most cases.  are you asking about fmj cause you like the exit wound?  if that's the case i think you're a wise man.  two holes are better than one.  although +p 147 gr hollow point will probably create a bigger exit.  the same people that warn of over-penetration are the same people that agree a .357 magnum is better than a 9mm.<br>  <br>  longlife, penetration kills.  it's why rifles are more deadly than pistols.|`|W380tuKiaa	Have you tried "cheaper than dirt"   cheaperthandirt.com|`|kQSSz2X2aa	As you can see from the above answers there are many places available to purchase +p FMJ in 9mm. However, make sure that your gun is rated for +p loads. If it's not you run the risk of bulging the barrel.<br>  <br>  Also, for defensive loads you do NOT want a lot of penetration. You want a hollow point that stays in the body rather than punching through. A bullet only has so much energy when it leaves the barrel and when it stays in the body all of its energy is transfered to the body causing the most amount of damage.<br>  <br>  When the bullet punches through the body (as FMJs tend to do) it wastes some of the bullets energy that could have gone into doing damage to the body into making the bullet travel beyond the body.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	yes<br>  <a href="http://www.buffalobore.com/ammunition/default.htm#9mm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buffalobore.com/ammunition/de...</a>
6LQNK51uaa	They both r same in some manner but Vince is a better leader..he knows how this business works and how to handle his roster...yes he is a ego maniac and does mistakes but we also have to show respect for his dedication for this business.....On the other hand JJ is nothing but the doll of Vince Russo...he has no self respect,JJ will do anything to please his big stars.....look what he has done with the X-Division the division which really made TNA what it is now.<br>  So<br>  <br>  Respect from Talents--->JJ<br>  Respect from Fans---->Vince<br>  Business Respect---->Vince<br>  Who loves his company more-->Vince<br>  Better Leader--->Vince<br>  Visionary--->Vince<br>  <br>  So overall Vince is better...he Lives and Dies for WWE.|`|NZKramllaa	Jeff Jarrett, He has more Pride for his Company. Vince is just a smarter business man and knows how to sell more than Jarrett but He does have a Extreme amount of Pride for his Fans and the Company also and Shouldn't be discarded for it. WWE was basically a already built Empire when Vince bought it from his father and there wasn't much difficulty Promoting. Jeff as he says it "Built TNA from the Stinkin Ground Up!" and went through major difficulty's getting TNA where it is Today. Like Vince did, Jarrett didn't have the privileges of having TNA on a major Network like USA or NBC, there were times Jarrett had to air TNA over the Internet, because they didn't pull in Ratings and Sky Sports had to cancel there Contract, and to see where TNA is today Jarrett deserves props. He did what alot of Indy Promotions dream to do and right now he is going against a giant of Competition  and still pulling through. He may never be a Smarter Business man than Vince and know how to Market but He does seem to have more pride in his Company.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I think McMahon does, but if you really think about it I think Jarrett should. Jeff Jarrett and his father along with Dixie Carter built TNA up from the ground, whereas Vince McMahon just purchased it from his father after it was already up and going. Although he did make it what it is today. <br>  <br>  As Far as Respect, Love, Passion for the Fans and Talent I would say Jarrett but the rest would go to Vince.|`|H7p09fL2aa	honestly jarret<br>  vince cares more about money than all<br>  if he has a monkey that wins more money than shelton benjamin or someone else that monkey would take his us title<br>  i do prefer wwe and all<br>  but i think tna thinks alot about their superstars and doesnt overate or underate much|`|1JywgkyMaa	jeff,because he's smart enough to see who deserves a push,and he doesn't release wrestlers just because it makes him feel important.vince mcmahon is just selfish and greedy,he could care less what fans want,to him,it's all about the money|`|Hp40PucSaa	i would have to say jeff jarret because he build tna from the ground up and the only thing vince did was take over for his dad.|`|3IsHR4reaa	I disagree with whatever Hardy Fan Said....|`|8iRi6hqSaa	Jeff Jarett|`|khU8m4gxaa	It's impossible to say, because we obviously wouldn't know, but I would believe Jarrett has more respect for the talent, considering that he was a wrestler for 2 decades & understands the sacrifice firsthand. However, Vince can take pride in the fact that he took a regional company to nationwide, then worldwide status, making hundreds of millions in the process. Jarrett has done relatively well with TNA, but he has Dixie Carter's money to lean on. Without Panda Energy's financing, TNA would be extinct by now. So while Jarrett most likely has a different type of passion for the business than Vince has, considering his years on the road & in the ring, they both came up in the business, as their fathers were also promoters, so I believe Vince's passion can't be discounted. If he didn't have it, he could have stepped away & left it to Shane & Steph years ago.|`|dcNT65mTaa	TNA is Jeff Jarrett's baby and he'll work and work to keep it alive and well. Vince has become more about the money than about the fans. Everything is about what's best for business. When you hear him, it's hard to tell whether it's gimmick or if he's sincere.

If anything we are better since McGrady is done and Alston is gone. I think Lebron will be fine, but as of Ben he's through. You just have to learn to adjust to problems. Not to be biased but the Rockets have learned to play without McGrady (since he's always missing games) we've had season worth of practice and that practice has paid off. We are 17-6 without hime.

There's a bunch of them, all huge.|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	That would be the legendary Anoai family:<br>  <br>  The founders of the family, Reverend Amituanai Anoa'i and his wife Tovale, had four children: three sons, Afa, Junior, and Sika; and one daughter, Vera, who died April 26, 2008.<br>  <br>  Afa and Sika became wrestlers, forming the tag team the Wild Samoans. <br>  Afa's three sons are all wrestlers — Samula (best known as Samu), Afa Jr. (known as Manu) and Lloyd (best known as L.A. Smooth). His daughter Monica Anoa'i is the widow of wrestler Gary Albright. His other daughter Lynn Tovale Anoai is a model and actress. <br>  Junior is the father of the late Rodney Anoa'i, known best under his WWF moniker Yokozuna. <br>  Vera married Solofa Fatu and gave birth to three sons, who all would become wrestlers: Sam Fatu (known as Tama and Tonga Kid), Solofa Fatu Jr. (as Fatu and Rikishi and Junior Fatu ) and Eddie Fatu (known as Jamal and Umaga). <br>  Sika's older son Matt Anoa'i is wrestling under the name Ro'Z and Rosey, while his younger son Joe played football for Georgia Tech and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Minnesota Vikings. <br>  Afa and Sika's father considered Peter Maivia his "blood brother", a connection that continued to Afa and Sika, who regard Peter as their uncle. Peter Maivia and his wife Leah Maivia had a daughter, Ata Maivia, married wrestler Rocky Johnson. The couple became the parents of Dwayne Johnson, who was better known as The Rock before establishing himself as a successful actor. Peter Maivia's youngest son Toa is in training to wrestle. Maivia's oldest son Peter Fanene Jnr is in the real estate business. <br>  Hollywood stuntman Tanoai Reed (aka Toa on the new American Gladiators) is the great nephew of wrestling promoter Leah Maivia (Peter Maivia's wife) <br>  Boxer David Tua, actor Solo Siaopo are also related to the Anoa'i family.[citation needed] <br>  Linked to the family by marriage but not actually a blood relative is wrestler "Superfly" Jimmy Snuka. Snuka's son Jimmy Snuka Jr. now wrestles for Raw as Sim Snuka. <br>  In an Article in Pro Wrestling Illustrated Samoa Joe claims to share a distant ancestor with the Anoa'i family, but well before Reverend Amituanai Anoa'i, so he is not a member of the family.[citation needed] <br>  It was announced on October 21, 2008, that Leah Maivia passed away at the age of 81.[1]|`|dcNT65mTaa	The Anoa'i family|`|86kZ5uYwaa	anoa'i|`|VCp9piy5aa	The Ano'i family.|`|U5ANBu9oaa	Ano'i family.|`|H7p09fL2aa	anoa'i<br>  and rikishi and umaga are also fatu

You just have to find one that interests you and will give you what you want out of it.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	no martial art is better than another, you must be well versed in all to be a good fighter. you must know boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, jiu jitsu, don't limit your self to one particular style, and train in all aspects of fighting, stand up to ground|`|Xs1cXFjPaa	There is no such thing as the "best martial art" but what makes the martial art great is the martial artist. So you can't really compare martial arts, they all have their own unique skills and such, it really depends on the practitioner.|`|szcA8CDyaa	There is no best martial art in this world. The only thing is how good they are and all of martial art are the same, they do self-defence. I go for taekwondo.|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	Tae Kwon Do is really fun. It's high energy and great for your body.|`|A4Mm0YNdaa	The answer to that is entirely circumstantial.  What, in your definition of "best," makes a martial art good?  Taekwondo has fabulous kicks, wester boxing has fabulous punches, wushu and capoeira look incredible...they all have their relative areas of strength and weakness.  The "best" martial art depends entirely on what you're looking for in a martial art.  If you want grappling, BJJ is a great place to start, not to mention end.  If you want striking, Taekwondo, boxing, and Muay Thai are all great.  If you want stuff from the movies, Wushu is one of the best.  If you want handy, all around defense, any jujitsu or hapkido form is worth looking into (all of the above, if practiced with enough skill, will serve that purpose too, but these are two more particularly suited to defense).  Hope this proves helpful.|`|Ufgi96eIaa	depends, you want to attack kung fu <br>  if you want to defend ta kown do|`|ONFI9GfQaa	No such thing.

If you shorten the races by 25 percent, they better be ready to cut 25 percent off ticket prices.  Also don't forget shorter races means less commercials and less revenues.  I watch every lap, every race. If the races are too long for YOU, then turn the channel to the race with 50 to go.  Everybody wins that way.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	I wish they would make them longer, because its the best sport in the world. There are some pretty cool commercials during Nascar races.

Hope that helps and good luck! =]|`|aBJGIhjNaa	you could be real fast and be really useful cause of that or a good first baseman which does not take much but a good eye|`|s4VzPulYaa	They won't not let you tryout because you are skinny!<br>  We have a girl on my team that we call 'chicken legs' because she is so skinny.<br>  She is little, but she is such a power hitter.<br>  I am also little, and I'm not as much of a power hitter, because I'm a slapbunter, but I have speed, and speed is all you will need.<br>  As for soccer, your weight doesn't matter either.<br>  I'm 4 ft 10.5 in and 105 pounds, and my team says i'm their little 'bulldog' because i like to go out there and push the other players and be really aggressive.<br>  So i'm pretty sure you will be able to tryout and do good =D|`|Iod5edCSaa	weight has nothing to do with whether or not you can try out for the team. All you have to do is be able to run thrown and catch. If you can hit a little that helps but if you are fast enough the coach will still take you and teach you to slap hit and bunt

OAEuYZkZaa	Sorry I can't help more but all I can tell you is that it was made after 1940.  The last serial number for 1940 was 398,400.<br>  <br>  At a guess, I'd say your rifle was probably made in the mid-1950's or perhaps later.  It took Savage 41 years to make the first 398,000 Model 99's, and production was interrupted during WWII.  Civilian production didn't really get back into its swing until 1947 or 1948.  Hence my guesstimate of not earlier than the mid-1950's.<br>  <br>  I do not know the total production numbers for the Model 99 so it might have been made very much later than the 1950's perhaps even into the 1980's or 1990's.<br>  <br>  Sorry I could not be more help.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	There are a couple of sources listed by Savage on the web page below.  Unfortunately, Savage themselves says on the same page that, 'Savage Arms is no longer able to access historical information on older Savage, Stevens, or Fox firearms.'  Ya.  Me too.  In an age when the disseminationn of information is automated for so little cost, our firearms industry has made some very annoying choices as regards sharing range of S/Ns used for given years.

A4Mm0YNdaa	(1) He was an icon, hero, and role model because he was a spectacularly skilled and disciplined martial artist who also happened to be a movie star.  (2) He decided to found Jeet Kune Do because he felt the philosophy and technique was worth sharing with other martial artists.  (3)  He was capable of performing such exceptional physical feats because of his exceptional physical and mental conditioning and training.  (4) He died young because of his cerebral edema.  (5) He was so fast for the same reason that he was so strong: he trained his mind and body with more diligence, consistency, and intensity than any other man I've heard of.  (6) His ability to break 6" wooden boards stemmed from the same source.  (7) His cerebral edema was probably caused by a reaction to chemicals in a prescription painkiller he took shortly before he died.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question, but next time consider perusing Wikipedia yourself ahead of time.|`|GSCD9vq3aa	You have to get up, and go do some research. Bruce was the best martial artist of the late 20th century, around 1965, he started his first well known public apperance called Gree Hornet, wasn't a very good show, it lasted for a season and was cancelled. Next he filmed in a Hong Kong film called fist of fury, as well as another one, all this he did while training, this is how he built his reputation and made money, he's trained quite a few people, next he worked on small skits and went around the world. The next biggest film was with Chuck Norris, who he gave a generous chance to beat him before he beat him, after that he made another film showing his skill and philosophy. He made his last film in 1973 which was primarily made to show his extraordinary fighting feats. HE trained vigorusly for this one, got sick a couple of times, but soon after died of a tumor unexpectedly, many years later they believe it was his body burning out. Bruce Lee started training JeetKune Do in 1967. He wrote various books on it that he never published until long after he died his wife published it. Bruce was asian so his ability to do things people can't do is not surprising, Bruce was also hyper more than any other asian so he was a lot better than most asians. Since many people who say they trained with Bruce act nothing like what he taught when he trained, it's obvious the'r lieing. Bruce's 2nd to last movie was shown in theaters in 1976.

Yes.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	its obvious indian fans love to under estimate any team~|`|4VoQduaZaa	New Zealand cricket team has not won any major tournament. Also, the players do not have star value for some reason. I personally feel that players like McCullum and Vettori should be given much more respect by cricket community across the world. But somehow, that does not happen. If you look back over last 30 years or so, NZ team has not had a superstar besides Hadlee and Martin Crowe. Fans love the crowd-pullers and Bond was definitely one of them. But unfortunately, he is not playing. If you look at all other countries, they have had some major success or have some players which qualify as a brand. New Zealand team has never been an easy team to beat. But at the same time, they have never been the toughest team to beat in any period of NZ cricket history. I think once they win some major tournament, nobody will under-estimate them.|`|eHcXI4jFaa	some clearly do.  NZ are a very good ODI team and made semis in 20/20 trophy/  NZ struggles in ICC trophy because they have often been drawn in the same pool as Australia.  Their rankings are efefcted over time because they plau Australia more than any other team.  I have little doubt if India had come to tour more regularly, that would have been a few more points in the rankings.  They also regularly make the semis in the world cups (and when they did not it was to do with controversy ZIM/Kenya).  <br>  <br>  To say they have no stars is wrong.  Vettori!! consistently number 1 or 2 ODI bowler in the world/Mills is currently 5, has been as high as 3 recently.  Oram, consistently at top of all rounder rankings despite injuries.  Plus McCullum is a great keeper (sure Dhoni + others might be better batsman but he is an average keeper).  <br>  <br>  So add in promising players like Ellioy/Guptil averaging 60 odd in ODI.  Taylor, becoming a consistently good batsman averaging 40 odd.  southee probably the best young prospect for a long time, I think there is quality in addition to team work.  <br>  <br>  Time will tell if India has the quality to handle playing in NZ conditions (though much tamer than last time theyw ere here).|`|WaWZYxmzaa	I don't feel that cricket fans under-estimate the NZ cricket team, I feel that the fans get frustrated with the their inconsistency,they certainly have the talent...... but just don't seem to be able to deliver "knockout blows" at crucial times in crucial matches|`|3MoVd4xVaa	Dear Charu please do your research<br>  <br>  October 2000 - The Black Caps beat India in the one-day ICC knockout final, their first ever tournament win.<br>  <br>  New Zealand are still underated.

The problem lies in the NZ cricket culture and history in which, it has always been dominated and lived in the shadow of Australia. Also I believe NZ cricketers are very open minded and keep their options open in terms of their career, so they do play the sport but do not prioritise it. NZ is known for All blacks and NZ cricket always gets a step motherly treatment from its people. Well I can talk heaps, but surely India didn't undermine Nz strength, that's how they play usually on streets, they are like the Brazilians of football, rely heavily on flair and charisma. Things are changing for them and soon they will learn from their mistakes to play smart cricket not street cricket.|`|NHVbHEJsaa	In some ways it goes to show that (unlike Rugby) we can handle a loss or two. We do have a great team at the moment but understanding that the 2 teams we've just played are the best in the world - i think we've been more realistic.

Most people underestimate them because if you compare the teams man for man then New Zealand always looks the weaker side but the fact remains this is a  team sport and the New Zealand team gel very well.

They haven't choked two in a row like the mets|`|LupVriVyaa	yankees this year as there filling up with stars 200mil on three players!<br>  now they have jeter,rodriguez, teixiera, burnett, santana,and possibly chamberlain and chien-ming-wang has a good year!<br>  mets were a better team on paper last year though|`|k6EOio40aa	On paper  the Yankees are better.<br>  But on the field it is arguably the Mets. And that is saying alot coming from a Braves fan.
1MX8ENzXaa	Using you lungs a lot causes an increase in mucus and saliva production.|`|eaagpElnaa	People new to running usually spit quite alot while running. its all part of the body or rather cardio conditioning thats taking place. Give it a few weeks and the spitting should decrease.<br>  Also having to spit is a good sign that your lungs/cardio system is being worked nicely. So it isnt necessarily a bad thing.<br>  However, you should be cautios when spitting and take into account other runners/where you choose to spit and the wind direction|`|FraPsQV6aa	because you're sexy ;]<br>  <br>  i don't know why but I have the samee problem.  you should practice spitting and then do it in front of freshmen and then watch them spit because they usually get it all over their face and arms and legs lmao
s9Pwnb87aa	Tony Dungy told them to.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	Money!!!! Now seeing what is going on in the NFL money wise i can see many cut players not playing this year due to wanting to much money. I think with the upstart of the AAFL, USFL, and UFL leagues in 2009 and 2010 will have a chance to succeed as many players will be going to play in those leagues so they can get a shot at getting back to the NFL. Will be nice to see 3 new leagues with salary caps coming around so many more can watch football.|`|L3byzh3Gaa	they wanted to make salary cap room, plus those players weren't that great anyways. the Buccaneers are trying to pick up more younger players to rebuild their team.|`|goe3y4FPaa	cause there idiots..|`|YFFhkRSdaa	they are gettin rid of the tampa two thats y they got rid of june they got rid of the rest except for brooks b/c they have better players and they got rid of brooks b/c he is only a two down player and they wanted to go young|`|MM5iGrnIaa	Probably couldn't afford them.<br>  If a team doesn't win, their funds decrease.<br>  One time the browns kept losing so much that the team went broke, and was no longer a team for awhile.|`|a074aac3ad17521564085d29e2af8d4faa	I can't believe that they dropped Derrick Brooks. They started the rebuilding process the day that Jon Gruden was fired.  This must be another part of the plan.|`|bZ1BsNveaa	Cap Room, all of the players are really good so their highly paid but didnt do crap for the last couple of seasons. and oh yea new coach.|`|znccVpkeaa	maybe they have some financial problems and they can't afford to pay all the top players wages|`|DjF6Uytuaa	Cause they want to lose. They can not afford to fly to playoff games. Bad Economy.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	cause there all in there mid 30's besides june.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	they need to rebuild that team<br>  <br>  They need younger guys at key positions, so they don't get tired and fall apart at the end of the year again.|`|4KTe107Yaa	That means Garcia is available to come back to the Eagles
4Zg7yDh6aa	I wouldnt do it because McCabe might be better than Ehrhoff but you already have a strong blue line and Frolov is only going to increase his points for the rest of the season|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	I wouldn't do it. McCabe and Ehrhoff are basically just throw in players. While McCabe has slightly better stats neither one is going to contribute on a consistent basis for you.<br>  <br>  The real trade here is Kostitsyn for Frolov. Frolov has more goals, assists, points, and they are very close in penalty mins. Add in the fact that Frolov is a lot more consistent than Kostitsyn and I would decline this trade right away.|`|539babdd05cb8f15f125aa0052e12d02aa	No, I think you'r players are going to get more points then his will for the rest of the season.

Not this year...|`|3ULjjUNlaa	If they make it to the playoffs, I'll give you 10 grand and a left nut.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	You are kidding me... right?|`|t14Jk1IPaa	If they made the playoffs and won the Stanley Cup, it would be a good freaking story! I hope they make the playoffs instead of calgary, edmonton, and minnasota. I hate those teams, but I Love the Canucks!|`|LupVriVyaa	if they can get like a 6 game winning steak then get a above 500 average for the rest of the game its possible but colorados best bet is to go more bad(no offense!) and get a high pick in the draft cause the 5 worst teams in the nhl are all from the east|`|wvVGPnoyaa	ROFL are you serious they are in LAST place in the west it will be a miracle if they finish 14th place in the west, when you have goalies as poor as the Av's do you cant help but loose.|`|YN8Rbjogaa	that's a funny one! NO ONE thinks the Avs are gonna even make the playoffs, let alone win the cup this year!|`|AVc1PCu5aa	They are last place in the west right now.  I guess technically they still have a shot, but realistically, no.|`|tW8fh4IGaa	Hahahahahahahahahaha! Thanks buddy, I needed a good laugh.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	Eighth seeds have about a 3.7% chance of making the finals.  For the Av's to get in they'd have to be playing very well and truthfully you just never know.  Stranger things have happened.|`|x9GODf8eaa	If they get in, then they have a shot, but I personally think they are done.<br>  <br>  They currently sit in 15th, 8 points back of 8th place Dallas. Now, that doesn't seem like much, but they would have to pass 7 teams to get there. That is the hard part. Because those teams are playing eachother often, everyone is picking up points. 3 point games (overtime) is Colorado's worst enemy.<br>  <br>  To add to their struggles, Dallas has no less than 3 games in hand. It would take a minor miracle to get the Avs into the postseason.

DM2M5LK4aa	I would go with either Boxing or Jeet Kune Do.  <br>  <br>  Boxing is a traditional stand-up fighting art that is completely based on punching.  There are varieties such as the cross, jab, right hook, left hook, liver shot, kidney shots, upper cuts, right/left straights, etc.  Again, boxing focuses completely on striking your opponent with your upper body.<br>  <br>  Translated, "Jeet Kune Do" means "Way of the intercepting fist" in Chinese.  Jeet Kune Do is much more of a rounded art that was formed by a combination of many different martial arts.  It encompasses stand up fighting, defensive and offensive, defense against weapons and also the use of some weapons, lots of kicks and ground work (in a nutshell). Bruce Lee defined it as an art that is constantly changing, and that may be different for different people.  Every person, he thought, had a bit of a different style that he/she was naturally better at than anything else.  This art involves utilizing those natural abilities and training your body to work with your natural instincts to become an efficient fighter.  He designed it to not be set in stone, but to be able to always change and transform; in essence, it is always able to be perfected both on the individual level and with the style itself.<br>  <br>  Although Boxing utilizes all of these punches, they are learned in JKD too.  Furthermore, JKD utilizes things that boxing does not (at least traditional boxing in its competition form) such as palm strikes and strikes with both the bottom of a clenched fist, which is called a hammer strike, and strikes with top side of your hand when it is in a fist.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, there are MANY different styles of martial arts out there: and lots of them, you will find, combine many different fighting styles into one, such as Krav Maga, which I am training in.  Krav Maga also teaches traditional punching in addition to some of these other strikes I mentioned earlier.  The only reason I don't say that Krav Maga has the most variety of punches is that the art is more focused on practical self defense and real street fighting (it is used by the Israeli military and Israeli Special Forces), rather than specific types of punches and forms.<br>  <br>  So if you are looking for the most varieties of punches, then I definitely would go with Jeet Kune Do.|`|v6HKgltzaa	I wonder why you're asking this question?  A variety of punches doesn't necessarily mean it's better.<br>  <br>  Kung fu and Karate REALLY, are not practical self-defense martial arts.  I would recommend Muay Thai.  One special variety of 'punch' it utilizes is the elbow.  Very deadly.<br>  But yeah, I'd have to say boxing, as it specializes completely in punching.|`|EnwwqUGZaa	I doubt seriously there is an answer to this.  If there is, it is probably a tie among many.  There are only so many ways the body works.  If we are talking hand strikes, there are so many hand weapons you can form, so many way to apply it.<br>  <br>  Attacks are either in a straight line or a circle, they are either horizontal, vertical, or angular between. Unless you grow a new kind of joint there are just no options outside of this.  <br>  <br>  I can punch gyaku, or a lunge punch, I can hook, upper cut, swing mawashi, or drop the fist from a vertical circle.  Open hand or closed hand, hard or soft, pick a hand weapon, linear or circular...<br>  <br>  The other side of that coin is seiken.  Proper fist.  One right way to punch, only one.  The other are hand strikes and valid, but for punching... seiken.|`|ve4LsVszaa	Kung fu has the potential to have to most.  Kung fu has all the karate punches, punches unique to kung fu, and modern forms of kung fu have the boxing punches as well.|`|gBO908P6aa	Someone already said it.  Jeet Kune Do is not a style but it's more like a training program that exposes the student to a multitude of other styles and techniques.  There's only so many ways a fist can be made and can travel.  JKD training can incorporate punching from styles like Boxing, Karate, Wing Chun, Filipino boxing or Panantukan.  The fist is used in a variety of angles and ways in these styles.<br>  <br>  A student will learn jabs, hooks, crosses, backhands, hammerfists, limb strikes, chain punches, straight vertical punching, punching with the knuckles, punches from the trapping position, etc|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	If you are talking punches only then all of them pretty much teach the same thing just with a different method of executing the punch. Now if you were to change your question to hand / arm strikes then either Kung Fu or Karate would be the answer since they have many more than others. For example in Karate you can strike with the knuckles, fingers, single finger, forearm, elbow, shoulder, palm and edge of the hand just to name a few.<br>  <br>  Edit - anyone who will claim that Karate is not a good defensive art has never taken authentic karate from a good instructor...get over it people. Unless you have 10 to 15 years of dedicated study in karate you never learned it at all.

kecdkv6jaa	To a new batsmen or tail ender, i bowl my usual outswing and occasional in swinger to them and they usually fall early (not bragging or anything, lol).<br>  <br>  But if there is a set batsmen at the crease i might try 3 outswingers then a bouncer then an in swinging yorker (and then another outswinger or slower ball for the last one) I try and get the batsmen used to my bowling style and then rattle them up with a variation.<br>  <br>  Although you might need to change what type of ball your bowling depending on the batsmen, (iis he aggresive or defensive, leg-side or offside player, stronger of the back foot or front foot etc.) all these factors need to be taken into consideration against good batsmen....it aint easy bein a bowler!!|`|DMszu9OUaa	Hey, i'm a leg spinner myself and my favourite three card trick is two big spinners pitching on off stump and spinning away followed by a flipper on off stump. the only times i can remember it not working is when the flipper didnt come off right or when the first two balls didnt spin enough, they have to beat the bat or else it wont work|`|mXFEnXRYaa	part timer here, i always bowl well flighted offies to the batsman in the first two bowls, but then i either give a seamer or faster one(just seams and can have extra pace or i give a short fast one were it doesn't bounce as much a is very deciving|`|wPlfPc0gaa	It is a long time since I played cricket. Initially I used to bowl fast, later I lost my rhythm and resorted to slow spinners. And rarely did I bowl. But I recall this one. I was bowling an over of slow deliveries. First 5 deliveries went for 1 run and a run-out. The single came in the fifth ball. The runout came 2 balls before that at the non-striker's end. The new batsman was at the non-striker's end and he was watching me bowl real slow stuff. After the single when he took strike he was too casual. I expected him to be and bowled a quicker one at yorker length. And the middle stump was uprooted.|`|bNcgqHGsaa	nice question.. <br>  <br>  i dont really have a 3 card trick because at my pace i rarely can trouble the batsman with sheer pace.. im more of a batting all rounder but for my school and university i always bowled the end overs..<br>  <br>  this happened once in the final stage.. he missed the first couple and i could see th crowd getting to it..<br>  <br>  3rd ball??? bouncer that pitched half way on the pitch..<br>  <br>  unfortunately for him, he almost ran down the track before i bowled it.. ws funny to see him fall over onto his stumps but i swear it wud have hurt big time.. lol|`|qNHMcRL4aa	Bowl and hope<br>  Bowl and hope<br>  Bowl and hope<br>  <br>  im not very good!!!!!! <br>  if its some1 i dont like then i tend to aim at them not the stumps!<br>  not a good stratogy but hey, it doesnt matter, i dont get toplay matches!|`|AA11088802	out swing , out swing, inswing yorker

I have yet to really see Suicide wrestle, so I just think he's a gimmick. Also, the TNA game sucked hardcore.

Both the costume and the "wrestler".|`|TAPBWPJLaa	I guess you haven't seen Mantaur, Repo Man, and The Red Rooster.<br>  <br>  And those were gimmicks in the WWF.|`|i1YnDdcLaa	agreed|`|UZvas18Qaa	yes
sqfjfR3iaa	The Following is taken from his Wrestling School Web Page:<br>  <br>  In life we all want to be respected and admired for our achievements. The ultimate form of respect is when your fellow peers put their children and grandchildren in your hands to teach them the very business they themselves excelled in. Reid Flair, son of the legendary Ric Flair, has moved to Eldon, Missouri to begin his training at the Harley Race Wrestling Academy.<br>  <br>  Reid joins the list of second and third generation superstars that have trained or are currently training under Harley Race including: <br>  Ted DiBiase and Mike Dibiase, son of the “Millon Dollar Man”, Ted DiBiase.<br>  Joe Hennig and Amy Hennig, grandson and granddaughter of Larry “The Axe” Hennig, who held the AWA World Team Championship with Harley Race, and son and daughter of the late “Mr.Perfect” Curt Hennig. Joe Henning who was recently signed by the WWE is currently one-half of the FCW’s Tag Team Champions. Amy Hennig is currently training at the academy and is on her way to future stardom. <br>  Ricky Steamboat Jr., son of wrestling great Ricky “The Dragon” Steamboat is also currently training at the school and will make his mark like his father before him. He will also be leaving after the first of the year, to train in Pro Wrestling Noah’s Dojo.<br>  <br>  Since it’s inception in 1999, Harley Race has been providing its students with the necessary tools to propel forward in the wrestling industry. Within the last five years seven students from the academy have signed with WWE. Several others have toured and trained with Japans premiere promotion ProWrestling NOAH. The Harley Race Wrestling Academy has a strong working relationship with WWE and ProWrestling NOAH. Both organizations attend the Harley Race Wrestling Camp every year to scout talent. The camp held every September in Eldon, Missouri, is the only place in the world that you will ever find both WWE and ProWrestling NOAH under one roof scouting talent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Harley Race lived a dream every time he stepped into the ring. He continues to pass that dream along by training the superstars of tomorrow. You can achieve your dreams too and be the next superstar to graduate from the academy.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Harley Race Wrestling Academy has moved to a larger facility at 1406 South Business Highway 54 in Eldon, Missouri. Due to the increase in size and the addition of a second ring, the school is now able to accommodate new students.<br>  <br>  For more information you can contact the school at 573-392-4100. <br>  <br>  It  looks impressive to me. If Pro Wrestling NOAH has him training wrestlers for them, he's good!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	"Sadistic" may be a harsh term...but this isn't a flag football class in college, so it is going to be incredibly hard early on to see who really wants it bad enough. <br>  <br>  People think that this "entertainment" is so easy to choreograph, etc., which is so far from the truth as to be laughable. But the better schools will teach you well and you will be prepared to chase your dreams.|`|hNIyshmkaa	Does the name Stu Hart ring a bell?

u8GHTJEEaa	As Vince was walking out to his limo (just before the explosion) on the June 11, 2007 episode of Monday Night RAW, Paul London could clearly be seen smiling (like an idiot, as some have described it) when Vince passed by. The rest of the wrestlers and the staff members had solemn looks on their faces. London caught huge heat for this. Here's a link to a picture of "The Smile": <a href="http://www.wrestlingforum.com/general-ww..." rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlingforum.com/general-ww...</a> Scroll down a little bit, you'll see it. This was not the first huge mistake Paul London made in 2007. A week or so earlier he let the cat out of the bag about Ashley Massaro being on Survivor. London would have been fired then, but Ashley (who was his girlfriend at the time) went to bat for him.<br>  <br>  After the smile, London was rarely seen again on WWE TV, in small part due to injury, in large part due to the above transgressions.He was eventually fired November 7, 2008.|`|zb40cLwOaa	he got released and has started wrestling for PWG|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	He started getting alot of heat after he smiled right before the limousine accident in 2007<br>  <br>  <br>  Then he eventually got released|`|hNIyshmkaa	He got released and is now wrestling in Mexico (I think).|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Don't know|`|bc5EELGhaa	he is supposed to come back under a mask in tna|`|7ImGw976aa	He left ages ago, got a lot of heat for some things that he did.|`|vyGyLV7paa	he got released i think and now he is wrestling in japan or mexico|`|x4CDslrDaa	he went to london
1gHVlfbNaa	Kobe just has a lot more haters because people mistake his aggressiveness and passion for arrogance.<br>  <br>  That's why if they find any little thing they can criticize about him, they would.|`|vJyF8siJaa	those are just haters, they won't admit kobe is good so they find holes in what he does.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	Kobe has alot more haters....<br>  <br>  haters despise greatness.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	CRAP!<br>  <br>  I can't believe LeBron had 0 assist tonight!<br>  <br>  He has never done that in his entire career!|`|sBeZWl35aa	I think Kobe has always kinda been looked at as a ball hog, especially since Shaq left.  LeBron is still really young and he only scored 21 pts. Kobe scored 61! thats like half ur team, i agree, it is wrong but that's just the way it is.|`|1q67udZKaa	Kobe has a worse reputation than LBJ. The rape case, Shaq getting traded, the such. The only bad thing i can say about LeBron, that comes to mind, is that he used to pass too much.|`|FjWGxVrjaa	That was the first time Lebron didn't have an assist in over 420 games.  When he scored 61 points Kobe had 3 assists and 0 rebounds.  Get your facts straight.|`|A71U6gNtaa	because Kobe has more Haters than LeBron cuz everybody love's LeBron.|`|eJ1yhF9Aaa	LEBRON LOVEEY LOVEY KOBE!!!|`|LkJUYMhMaa	cause kobe is the best and the teammates dont care there making millions|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well Kobe got more haters than LeBron. I honestly couldn't care less as long as we get the W.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Simple.  When you score 61 and have all your fans bragging about how great you are cuz you put up 61, all your haters are going to look at your boxscore and see what they can knock you on.<br>  <br>  When you score 21, no one gives a s**t because its not impressive, in fact, its a bad game, so no one really looks into your boxscore all that much.  <br>  <br>  If Kobe just scored 61 but you didn't have 50 people saying... omg omg, kobe scored 61, mvp, hes the best ever, move over mj, kobe is the greatest......  then the haters wouldn't have any reason to come back with..... he had no assists, he's a ballhog, etc.<br>  <br>  But, to answer your question, its ok for LeBron and not Kobe because no one gives a s**t about a 21 point performance.  Hell, if they did they would also bring up the fact that LeBron, who's supporters/Kobe haters will always say is a great rebounder, only had 1 rebound all game.  But, no one cares.  Had LeBron got hot and went for 50 you'd have plenty of people saying 50 in a loss means nothing, 50 with no assists and only 1 rebound shows he's not an all around player and a ball hog, etc.... But he didnt, he only scored 21, so no one cares.
lkm7qgYqaa	Every 12 minutes, one person dies because of a car accident. Every 14 seconds, a car accident results in an injured victim.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	skydiving accidents are car, car accidents are not. driving is something so simple and popular more than predicted people try doing it, barely pass the exam and add to the massive growing list of incompetent drivers. skydiving is a dangerous sport, there won't be any incompetent people there. well not as much as drivers of vehicles. <br>  <br>  most car accidents are caused by incompetence of the other driver or the victim, or by a natural occurrence rain, snow, storms), or one of the drivers is drunk or high. in skydiving none of these things happen, people don't drink and skydive. if the weather's bad you don't go. <br>  <br>  driving accidents are fairly low in the US when compared to many other nations. but you're still more likely to die in a car than suicide, homicide, gun crime, a huge list of other things. every 90 mins a car accident occurs, one in four is fatal.|`|PPkHeXT1aa	Well... There are a hell of a lot more drivers than skydivers. And I don't know about saying that because they are a skydiver means they are competent. <br>  <br>  Skydiving isn't 'dangerous' so to speak, but to imply that it is safer than getting in your car and driving to Safeway, I don't know about that.<br>  <br>  That being said, it is fun and you should try it!

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	In the WWE, because everybody has a gimmick (even the announcers and ring announcers) and everything IS written for them by Vince's team of writers, then the majority of the blame is on the writers if a gimmick fails to get over.  The wrestlers are just "actors" acting out what's written for them.  Vince McMahon took that creative freedom away from WWF/E wrestlers so the majority of the blame does go to the people creating the gimmicks (Vince, Creative, and the writers).  The person given the gimmick needs to have the talent to make the gimmick work but most of time if it's not getting over the writers will "tweak" the gimmick in attempts to make it work.  The wrestler, himself, really has little say in the matter.  He just has to make what he's given, work, by following the "scripts".<br>  <br>  That said, there are some who just don't have the charisma to get over, no matter what gimmick he or she's given.  They just can't get the fans to care enough about them to cheer or boo.<br>  <br>  This was something Vince McMahon Jr changed about pro wrestling.  Before Vince took over, wrestlers got over mostly on their in-ring talents.  If they were good at promos, that helped get them pushed to higher spots on the cards, and into championships.  Over-the-top gimmicks were really few and far between, and were used a lot of the time as "special attractions".<br>  <br>  BQ:  DDP is one.  Page was a big star in WCW, a good (but not great) in-ring performer and excellent on the mic.  He came to the WWF with the sale of WCW when Vince was proving a point (that WCW was nothing compared to the WWF).  DDP was put into that truly awful storyline of being the stalker of the Undertaker's wife (which made absolutely no sense being that DDP was married to a gorgeous woman and everybody knew it), then being squashed in the ring by Taker.  That just killed DDP's career, and he was fired shortly after that.<br>  <br>  Mike Awesome is another.  An absolute monster in Japan, and a killer in the original ECW, the WWF put the Hardcore Title on him...then had him job to Jeff Hardy for that title.  6'7 300 pound monster, famous in Japan and ECW for being a killer in hardcore matches, pinned by skinny little Jeff Hardy.  That spelled the end for Awesome, who was taken off of RAW and Smackdown and eventually fired.<br>  <br>  BQ2:  Agree.  Knox has a lot of potential.  Knox CAN wrestle but like most who enter the WWE he has been watered down and turned into strictly a brawler.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Every promotion needs at least one big monster brawler.  Knox needs that one defining feud to get him over big.  Kane could do it.  Kane got Snitsky over as a monster heel (Creative screwed that up by turning Snitsky into that feet-sniffing weirdo, then the guy with the brown teeth, but Kane did get him over before that).|`|pfke6Jieaa	to answer the first one i would deffinitely say muhammed hassan, he is like a italian and jordanian mix but looked arab so he was portrayed as a bad arab guy in the wwe, but had a lot of controversy and potential. <br>  <br>  as for the second one, im not sure if mike knox will be the future main eventer but he sure is doing good so far. i think he is in ecw though but i dont follow ecw or raw too much, i mostly follow smackdown.|`|3m9DQuDRaa	The problem sometimes occurs when an independant wrestler is stripped of his persona, because they don't want to sell the persona to a federation.  WWE has this horrible habit of expecting a wrestler to just hand over their persona in favor of a POSSIBLE good push.<br>  <br>  The problem is that if they don't get over with their indy name, they've sold it to the WWE, so when they leave, WWE IMMEDIATELY gives them a cease and desist notice, despite the fact that they came up with that gimmick...  so most indy wrestlers are wary of just giving their name over.<br>  <br>  Then the WWE decides that if the wrestler won't hand over the gimmick, they're going to change the ENTIRE gimmick...  and that's another gamble, because then the gimmick is pretty much a hit or miss.  And if it misses, be it the writers having no idea what to do with the gimmick, or because the wrestler just can't do the gimmick, the wrestler is released, like it's their complete fault that the gimmick didn't go over.<br>  <br>  A perfect example of this is Scotty Goldman.  There was no way Colt Cabana was going to just hand his gimmick to the WWE.  And the WWE wasn't going to pay Cabana any royalties, because they didn't know if he'd get over like CM Punk did.  But instead of helping out, they punished Colt for his decision, and gave him an incredibly generic name, and gave him no real gimmick...  then basically told him to get over.  Goldman actually got good responses to his on-screen idea...  but the WWE wasn't having it, because it breaks kayfabe in a way, and therefore it was killed before it got anywhere.  (This also happened with Shane Helms little "I'm jus' sayin'" gimmick.)  And then Scotty floundered until he ended up doing nothing in the fed.<br>  <br>  It's sad.<br>  <br>  BQ2?  No.  Mike Knox just doesn't have the potential.  He has the same floppy big guy talent that Snitsky did...  the only difference is that he has hair.  It's frustrating that WWE only tries with people his size, too...  because there's a LOT of great mid-weight wrestlers that could get over if they'd just give them the chance and stop punishing them by giving them crappy gimmicks...|`|GExKoh1Gaa	well if i could put a ratio on it .it would be 70-30<br>  70% responsibilty of the wrestler then 30% the creative team<br>  <br>  over the past years WWE has experimented many guys.<br>  <br>  for example CM punks title reign last year was a flop,he was over with some fans but not with the sheer majority needed.an excellent wrestler but his gimmick was weak and lacking.<br>  <br>  Jeff hardy is very over with the fans,but the problem is he still needs allot of work to be a main eventer and be the face of the company.right now he has been booked very well in a good storyline..he has the opportunity to work an excellent match with hardy.<br>  <br>  then again his mic skills are poor..WWE tried to push him but he wasn't up to scratch.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	i think it's a mix, no one needs a gimmick to make it but a storyline is something that needs to be earned not just handed to a young star. Look at Shelton Benjamin, you can't say they haven't given him the ball he beat triple h cleanly twice,he impresses in the ring but doesn't make that connection with the crowd needed. If the writers give a wrestler a script and it doesn't work right it is the wrestlers job to go talk to them and work on it to make it work. Big stars like Jericho aren't spoon fed lines, they work on there own promos. I'm betting Jericho and Ricky Steamboat sat down and talked about monday night and none of the writers will have had much say in it, younger stars need to take the ball for them self once they are given the chance.<br>  <br>  BQ: most recent is Manu, he had a lot of talent and potential from the little time i saw him in the ring. he did some things for a big man you just don't expect, pity he was let go before he had a chance to shine.<br>  <br>  BQ2: i think Mike Knox is just about ready, he can do a lot more than we have seen and just needs the right feud to get over looking like a serious contender and he could be a big main event player.

It's called a "sophomore jinx". He's having a bad stretch, but I'll don't think that it's a confidence problem. Rodney is a very confident player and he knows he can play. I think it has to do with motivation and the fact that Stuckey's venturing uncharted waters here. The Pistons are losing and he was in a winning situation last year. He might be a bit shocked by the situation, but I think it's motivation problem with him. He needs Michael Curry to get a little tough with him to get him motivated. Curry is not good a disciplining his players. Stuckey played well in the first half of the season, he's been a disappointment in the second half.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It is WAY to early to call him a bust. This is only his second year and nobody expected him to be as good as he was in his rookie season.
21J0IIZbaa	Brooks is the Rockets point guard of the future.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Ya he is pretty good from the outside perspective I have of him. Every time I see him play, which is not a lot he holds his own in there and is very talented. He is a good scorer and his passing is okay, but could use a little work. In fact, whenever I see him play I think he is a bit indecisive in knowing whether to score or pass. This is something a PG must master, especially a starting one. But, he has the talent to learn on the job and will pan out to be a good young point guard to orchestrate and lead the offense for the seasons to come..|`|JDfgU4H2aa	Yes, because he is playing well. Also, there isn't any point guard on the rockets who is as dominant as him. If they pick up someone in FA, he might be kicked out of the starter.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Yes,he will.If he keeps playing like last Rockest game ,he will be great PG|`|wuDplG1qaa	Most likely since he is the only point guard on that team.|`|o6KAdVUSaa	no kyle lowry|`|Rez6KpoNaa	he has been a bad boy yes he wil

The key is to HARNESS this energy and USE the adrenaline. <br>  <br>  My 2 mile time used to be 10:07 and I was pushing myself in training to break the 10 minute mark. While I was motivated, I didn't really have that extra push that was needed. I was competing last year in a 2 mile race and I remember I was extremely nervous as I had not run with many of the guys. I did my warm up and decided to pretend I was on a training run. I finished with a time of 9:47 - 20 seconds better than my previous PB.<br>  <br>  You fear running competitively because you dont want people to think less of you, and you want the satisfaction of running a good race in front of others. If you are able to USE this nervousness, then you will run a great race.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|zChpODnnaa	music|`|8n3NvYQwaa	its just second nature to want to win all the time<br>  <br>  Grant M|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	"We?"<br>  <br>  Although it happens to everyone, answers are individual.

If it doesn't work for you, rest assured that is normal.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Because you make it out to be more important in the big life scheme of things than it is.<br>  <br>  When you worry more about your general health, having enough to eat, and having a roof over your head, winning and losing and what others think becomes less important.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what people think of you winning or losing.

gUMucKOkaa	You can do that for free in Yahoo. Just go to commissioner tools in your league. I am doing a similar thing in two other leagues although with fewer keepers. But that should not matter.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit - Did you set up the league as a live draft league and then go to Commissioner tools. Of course the other people have to sign up for the league in order for you to do that. There is a place there where you (the commissioner) can enter the keepers and then the live draft starts with the next round. It even handles keepers in different rounds.<br>  <br>  You can e-mail me with your e-Mail address and I will try to send you more if you need it.|`|aEwd0f5Waa	For those who want to join an 8-team fantasy league and will draft at 5:00, the # is 140193 and pass is 123
abnqs0jQaa	From someone who has run for ten plus years, and competed in college, take the time off!<br>  <br>  Some of the other advice is smart, for example, the various heating, icing, stretching, shoes, and actually seeing a doctor.<br>  <br>  In terms of shoes, I too prefered Asics, much like another individual here. However, by no means does that mean you should get a pair of them. Go to a dedicated running shoe store, for example, NOT FootLocker or Dicks. In Boston we have Marathon sports, among various other shops, look some up in your area. A good shoe salesman, for a runner, will be able to look at your stride and can help determine the type of shoe that best fits your foot. This will do a world of good in terms of helping you to run more ergonomically correct.<br>  <br>  And while I said take the time off above, that does not mean stop exercising completely. There are many other ways of keeping your body in solid cardiovascular shape while not running.  The best thing to do is avoid impact exercises. Cross-train with swimming (fantastic full-body workout), eliptical machines, cycling, or even rowing ergometers. Alll of these can be used to keep some form of cardio vascular shape up. While the muscle groups used won't be the same necessarily, it will still be beneficial (I found swimming to be the best alternative).<br>  <br>  When you come back, running on concrete and asphalt creates a lot of wear and tear on the muscles, joints, and overall body. The surface has little give, and thus you body absorbs a greater proportion of the force from the impact of your foot strike. Trails would be a better alternative, as the soil generally will cushion more of the blow of each foot strike helping to alleviate some stress on the body. Keeping these things in mind, don't give up on running yet. See a doctor, as he might be able to propose a better timetable for starting certain activities, and then hopefully you will have a full recovery.<br>  <br>  There is also taping of the shins and calves, but I can not attest to how well that works, as I have not done that. It may only hel[p if the shinsplints are mild, but someone else may be able to provide better further information.<br>  <br>  Best of luck on the road to recovery!|`|6f45797c9517e54511512714a28d3760aa	Talk to your doctor, who might refer you to a physiotherapist. You should get this properly diagnosed as there are all sorts of things it could be and it would be a shame to give it up when it might be something that can be easily fixed, like changing your shoes or technique.<br>  <br>  It's easy for people to say what they think it is, or to read stuff on the internet and assume it's what you've got, but always better to have a professional diagnosis and treatment.|`|NK6AtTWBaa	I am an allstate cross country and track runner. I will help you all out. Some tips on preventing shin splints:<br>  Get good shoes, i prefer asics<br>  Make sure your stride is not too long<br>  If your legs hurt then run on the grass instead of pavement<br>  Stretch out your shins b 4 each run by leaning your back against a wall and put your heels 1 inch off of the wall. Lift up your toes 30 times. It will look weird but it is the best way to stop shin splints<br>  <br>  I hope i helped you|`|1kChldQ5aa	I know what you are feeling right now. I have had the same experience that you are having right now. I also asked my coach and she said to ice them, also before your going to start running make sure you stretch your calfs, you can do this by going up to a wall and pointing your toes up and leaning on the wall with your toes pointed up. also before running you should warm up your legs, then after practice keep them warm. you should also try doing RICE- rest-ice-compression-elevation. This help me a lot. you can also try taping your foot, this helps because when you flex your toes upwards it move your shin muscle, try taping your feet before you run and it might help aswell.<br>  <br>  You normally get shin splints if you havent ran for a long period of time, or if you run on hard ground. try getting a good pair of god or decent running shoes if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!|`|P055DfvBaa	Interesting.  you should be reading the questions that I have been posting.  i have had this same problem.  My pain is on the inside of my calves.  I just had x-rays taken to eliminate stress fractures and shin splints.  Now I am going to go see an orthopedic to see what it could be.  I have not ran for 2 weeks now.  You definatly should go to a doctor and do a lot a stretching from here on out.

mK06dus9aa	A team must have 7 players on the pitch for the game to be played if a team cannot field 7 players due to sendings offs or what ever, the ref will abandon the game and the team with too few players will deem to have lost.|`|wurimjbnaa	I think in real life it would be around 4-6 players a game. Shortage of players, and there is no longer a point to play the game if players get red cards.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	If a team has less than 7 players on the pitch,the game will stop and usually that team will forfeit the game.|`|1611a17a4b0cd6610c45b73de16234bcaa	yes it can...too many red cards can eventually end a game cos of shortage of players on the playing field..|`|QDHnd3Dyaa	Yep it is true. 'Coz of too many red cards in the game of football you can cause forfeiture(shortage of players) for either you or your opponent. in such a case then a score(2-0 I reckon but am not so sure...) is given to the team with greater number of players and a winner is deduced(it's a shame!!)...|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Yes, it is abandoned after 5 in one team i think|`|IXDiEX8eaa	Possible.
mK06dus9aa	FIFA rules allow a pitch to be between 100 and 130 yards long. So 2/3's can vary. <br>  <br>  What I hear far more often is things like "they are enjoyingg a lot of possession, but play keep breaking down in the final third" i.e. between the opponentss goal and 33-43 yards back onto the field off play.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	I'm not sure if it's the official way,but I usually separate the pitch into 3 sections.My team's penalty box,the rest of the pitch,my opponent's penalty box.So to me 2/3 of the field means anywhere before my opponent's penalty box,and the area beside it.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	The areas of the pitches are your opponent's area, the centre circle and your area. That's why on certain sports channels, they have a possession graph on a pitch, giving percentages on which area is being dominated in. It's like they can't find a perfect ball into their opponent's area in the final third and the opposing team go on a counter attack

And Trish dated Christian year or two after the group.<br>  And yes they did the upside down USA flag entrance.<br>  I think a good chunk of them have in different ways, Regal has done some things for the history but just not over successful at the moment. Lance Storm is still quite well known and a veteran, he teaches people at his training school and is now quite a crit and comments on the wrestling shows. One of the last I heard about Lance Storm getting in the ring was he only wanted to do something again with Christian, if that wasn't going to happen then he wasn't going to return for anything and called the current ECW a joke. Test... Don't know what he's doing right now but he has in some ways, just think he had bigger storylines and things in the attitude era. Been both of WWE and TNA but when in TNA and ECW weren't in it long. Jericho....... Doesn't even need to be said that he's had so much success and still on top and main event. His character i|`|x4CDslrDaa	no i dont
4YcZv0d7aa	I wouldn't mind seeing a Legends Lumberjack match. Have the legends who are still able to compete, around the ring. When Jericho falls out of the ring a few of the legends hold him while Rourke hits Jericho with the remains of his petrified Chihuahua (HA HA KIDDING). Actually, it would be a good idea, except for the dog part. Instead, Rourke would hit Jericho with the ring bell or chair. <br>  <br>  They roll Jericho back in and "Stone Cold" stuns him. Gets the pin and the other legends, again those who are able, pull off their old moves. One by one, maybe about 3 or 4 of the best moves. Especially, Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat, mostly due to the beating he got after telling Jericho off.<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't think that Hogan should be in a ring again. He is far too old and his knees are pretty much gone. Even in the last match he was in, his moveset was slow and stiff. The opponent pretty much had to walk into Hogan's move.|`|dcNT65mTaa	I think Austin vs Jericho is probably the best match their gonna get for Austin at the moment. Hogan vs Austin probably won't happen, and if it doesn't happen at wrestlemania, then it won't happen|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	So far it looks like Hogan is more willing to wrestle then Austin is.  So it'll probably end up being Hogan vs Jericho at Mania.|`|U5ANBu9oaa	no i would actually hate to see legends fighting at any pay per view against each other. their time is over. they can show up. make guest appearances or whatever but leave wrestling to the new generation(major flaw in TNA by the way).  If stone cold does face jericho at WM25 then its because Rourke didnt want to show up. and i wouldnt think of Austin as a people person so i doubt hed rally all his legend buddies. they might be present but not ringside.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	ive heard for weeks he would appear on raw to confront and maybe challenge jericho. hasnt happened. i heard just yesterday it may be jericho v hogan. austin v hogan needs to happen at wrestlemania|`|DJeij6Pgaa	Jericho will kill the legends|`|8iRi6hqSaa	Yes of course and then all legends will beat up jericho<br>  i think hogan vs stone cold summerslam but it does fit backlash

LEQowzHCaa	I actually heard that...<br>  <br>  A inside source of TPS has identified that their is a possibility that Jay Bouwmeester and Nathan Horton of the Florida Panthers could be traded any day now to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Tomas Kaberle a draft pick and either of 3 options in Mikhail Grabovski, Nikolai Kulemin or Jiri Tlusty.<br>  <br>  A second rumor has also surfaced during the All Star weekend that Leafs prospect Justin Pogge is on the trading block and can be traded for JS Giguere of the Anaheim Ducks or Niklas Backstrom of the Minnesota Wild.<br>  <br>  These both would be an interesting trades and possibly excellent moves for the Leafs who would be able to fill their needs with talented young players.  The only problem with trading Pogge is that the Leafs would then have 2 starting high priced goalies on their roster.  If this trade does happen you can expect Vesa Toskala to also be traded.<br>  <br>  We'll just have to wait and see if these rumors actually come to fruition.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Brian Burke isn't returning that call.<br>  <br>  Kaberle gave a list of teams; my guess is that this is your top-end teams.  <br>  <br>  That's a horrible deal; Bouwmeester becomes a UFA on July 1st, so potentially, the Leafs lose their best defenceman and...well, the other guy, for a monthlong rental on a team that has nil chance of playing beyond the regular season?|`|dXpxKVRfaa	I don't think so. Both Kaberle and Bouwmeester are too valuable to their respective teams. And why would Toronto go for Bouwmeester when they aren't in the playoff race. The only way that would even make sense for Toronto is if they got Bouwmeester to resign as part of the deal. And if that deal were to happen, Toronto definitely wouldn't get a pick in return, it would have to be Bouwmeester alone, he is more valuable than Antropov and Kaberle combined.<br>  <br>  I don't see Florida trading Bouwmeester away because they are in the mix of the playoff race. We all know he most likely wont resign because he wants to play in a better hockey market, but I don't see the Panthers trading him away while this much in the mix. That would be a major slap in the face to Panther fans.|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	With the Panthers on the brink of finally making the playoffs don't count on them trading Bouwmeester away. Plus Toronto is looking for huge returns for all of their throw away players. Kaberle will end up getting traded but it wont be to Florida and it wont be for Bouwmeester.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Toronto is seeking is seeking a LOT more than Bouwmeester and a pick for Kaberle alone, let alone both Kaberle and Antropov.<br>  <br>  As it stands, Florida is not one of the teams that Kaberle will lift his clause for.|`|3g08yf94aa	Florida need a scorer i heard rumors that it might be for gaborik but im not sure|`|9vLzGwVqaa	NEVER!|`|Q6Dyu1zKaa	Not going to happen.

YYqrT4jBaa	Don't bother paying $50 more for an Epiphany. According the linked reviews from pbreview.com, the Ion has an average 9.0 out of 1647 reviews and the Epiphany only has an 8.9 out of 109 reviews. Both markers are good but you can't justify spending $50 more on nothing.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what one review says the Proto SLG is not that much better than the Ion. The SLG UL is slightly lower rated than the SLG. It really depends on what look you like and what you find looking through the reviews. I recommend checking reviews on pbreview before buying anything paintball. <br>  <br>  But between the Epiphany and the Ion, get the Ion.|`|mRJk26MTaa	They're both actually pretty bad. Ions don't shoot nearly as well as they should for the price, and the Epiphany is almost the exact same as an Ion but with a different body/frame.<br>  <br>  I would personally go for either a Proto SLG 09 Basic or a Proto SLG 09 UL. Far better than either the Epiphany or the Ion.|`|xfRwel49aa	pbreview sucks ignore it|`|xE6WXVIeaa	I'd get the Ion. It's an entry level speedball marker out of the box, but can be upgraded to shoot as well as anything on the market, it's easy to maintain and repair. You can use the $50 you saved in not buying the Epiphany to get few upgrades for the Ion.<br>  The Epiphany uses a higher pressure solenoid and has volume control inserts for the fire chamber that are supposed to prevent shoot-down at any rate of fire, but in my opinion it's a useless gimmick since a properly set up marker won't suffer shoot-down anyway. And besides, lower pressure markers tend to break less paint and shoot quieter.|`|0wHeVJ50aa	Epiphany is just a little better than the Ion when both are stock. However, you can upgrade the Ion to become a top of the line marker. Go with the Ion. When you do get it, get a clamping feedneck, barrel, QEV, and maybe an ASA on/off. You could also get a new trigger. The reason the Epiphany is more expensive is because the fire chamber is able to accept inserts. I would personally just save my money and buy a Dye :)|`|YxpHWFpJaa	PB review often has biased reviews, or people bashing a marker simply because they dislike it. I've played with both. They are practically the same thing. However the epiphany is more pricey. Go with the Ion, more out there for it, very nice gun with a great price tag. Smart Parts is a good choice.
lYnkvRASaa	Who: will be the first to be permanently moved off the team?<br>  <br>  osgood<br>  <br>  Where: will they go?<br>  Home<br>  <br>  What: will be the situational trigger?<br>  <br>  GAA balloons to 6 and Wings fans revolt as they have a hard time justifying him as a HOF candidate<br>  <br>  Who: will replace him/them?<br>  Hasek's coming back from the retirement home.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, Osgood's time has come and gone.  Howard will get a shot but if he is not capable they will go out and find a middle of the road goalie for 2M per season.  Wings believe in spending money of D not in the nets.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	It may very well be the last season we see Osgood if he doesnt get his head right (and stop a few more pucks) and Conklin is a UFA after the season so next years edition of Red Wings goalies could be considerably different. They may hand the reins over to Howard and bring in a cheap veteran backup as soon as next year if they fail to win the Cup this year. They have Daniel Larrson in Grand Rapids who has so far outplayed Howard this season (although Howard has been playing well the past 6-8 weeks) and Larrson was a top goaler in the Swedish Elite league the past couple seasons (and is a year younger than Howard) so it is possible Larrson outplays Howard and starts next year in Detroit. 3 years from now...if one of those 2 hasnt established themselves as a frontline netminder look for them to quicken their pace to get Thomas McCollum to the NHL, he is considered the best prospect of the 3 and played extremely well in camp this past season.|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	I don't know how their current goalies contracts are set up, but I'd have to say that Osgood is getting very close to calling it a career. They may try to hang onto Conklin since he is a decent net minder and would be good in the role of mentoring a young kid.<br>  <br>  I think that the Wings will look to the draft for a new goaltender first and if they don't find someone they'll either pull off a trade before the deadline or get someone through free agency.|`|Iod5edCSaa	My guess is that in 3 years the goalie will be none of the above. Osgood and Conklin are both on the later stages of their careers. <br>  <br>  Howard has been around the system for a few years, and while he has not played himself out of a job, by know he should have played his way into one, which he has not done.<br>  <br>   So either someone else from the minors rises above Howard or its a free agent that the wings sign.|`|TmDLyzAUaa	I think that we are going to keep Conklin for the future. They will probably be our Head Goalie. (a.k.a. starting line-up goalie.) and i think that were going to lose Ossy!!! Yes that is how you spell it. Also we should be getting Howard too when Ossy's contract is up. So that is what i think!! Hope it helps!!!!! Be sure to watch the game tonight at 7:30. It's San Jose Sharks at Detroit!!!!<br>  <br>  GO WINGS!!! :-)|`|VuhGSVlraa	i think it is osgood who will be the future goaltender because he has the best overall record and he has demonstrated that he is the starter goalie and has already gotten the stanley cup with the detroit red wings and had 2 shutouts against pittsburgh in the finals while having the best overall gaa and save percentage. still this year he has been exceptional and has shown us that he is truely the future of the redwings goaltending. after domonik hasek was here osgood was not as good but he proved that he is the best becoming the starting goaltender and getting the conn smythe.|`|Q6fuBhPZaa	Conklin is old but so is Osgood        so they will get a good young goalie   who: there's no one to trade for but they might draft on and keep osgood and conklin for a while|`|zqrimtrnaa	Future: Howard<br>  Who: Osgood<br>  Where: Retired<br>  What: He won the Cup for his 4th time and goes out on top.<br>  Who: Howard because he is ready for the big lights.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	Hopefully not Osgood.  He should be gone as soon as his contract is up, and I think he'll retire whenever that is.  Then we'll probably resign Conklin, and Howard better step it up.  If Conklin starts sucking, or if Howard continues to disappoint, it's Mr. Outside-Hire time.  Which I think they should do anyway...

Its a very popular and a very effective string. It has a lot of spin and power, and there polyester. I think you'll like them, its one of the best poly's out there.|`|7Xiz8iwPaa	Luxilon is definitely great string. Best string and value on the market in my book, but i know plenty of players who are not fond of it. If you are looking for a string that generates power, i would recommend Prince Topspin 2. It is great string, long lasting and generates a lot of spin! I usually have one racquet strung with Luxilon and one with Prince Topspin so i can pick according to my mood. Luxilon is great when i am feeling good and am taking huge cuts at the ball. The Prince really helps me when i am playing kind of shabby. If helps build up my game by providing me with enough spin the drive balls and drop them on the top of the baseline. <br>  <br>  Conclusion, try Prince Topspin 2! Or you can try the original Prince Topspin, but the second version has a neon color =)|`|NBT5PoRVaa	I didn't like luxilon at first but i really grows on you. i suggest you try to luxilon agian. The luxilon takes about an hour of hitting before it feels just right.<br>  if you want to get good the best strings are strings with more control. get them and learn how to get good with them.

Comparable to tennis in the United States. While hockey will never break anywhere close to Soccer's numbers, Auto racing would most likely have very similar numbers. As of right now internationally speaking Soccer first Basketball second. The reason should be obvious to those with a bit of intelligence, I will spell it out for you. Both games can easily be picked up in any economic situation, this is the reason Basketball has exploded so much in the last 15 years. Much like soccer only a ball is required to play, everything else can be made up in spirit. <br>  <br>  By the way, Football would not last if it was played barefoot.

OrG2fBbKaa	The only thing that can go wrong are loss of balance, this results in either a recovery or a fall.  It is usually caused by a bad set up or a bad take off.  The solution is to do perfect practice repeatedly until you are always successful. In other words get out there and ski. Lead with your nose, keep your eyes open and look where you are going or landing.  Good control of your balance side to side and front and back are critical.

Nco3qtqsaa	Just because you can kick some ones azz doesnt mean you should. Be responsible. Those videos you watched are for self defense, But your not being attacked your the one looking for the fight. So lets say that you kick his azz hard, you hurt him, you got your victory. But then he comes back, with a gun. shoots you, bam! your dead. And for what? you died to show off your new moves? Just let things slide and if he acts violently again take action and call the cops. If you want to fight you should fight for the Sport and the Competition, and not for Anger and Violence.

The the show is live, and the bullets are real, things will go differently than you imagine.  Since you've posted in a boxing section, let me tell you a little bit about the sport.  Boxers don't fight angry.  If they did, they'd get beat every time.  The training teaches you how to react in as good a manner that is possible.<br>  <br>  I'm curious, what if you go to do what you learned in these instructional videos and he ducks?  Or bloodies your nose first?  Have you the experience to cope with a fluid situation?<br>  <br>  So let me rain on your parade and tell you that you'll probably lose  because you don't even know what winning is when it comes to a streetfight.<br>  <br>  Survival and escaping with your health.<br>  <br>  Throw away your instructional videos and take a real martial art, boxing, karate, kickboxing, whatever.  Gain experience in real fighting, then your bully will have no chance of ever hurting you again.

Since you are new to the position its important to focus on building footwork/hands, proper technique (diving, catching, situational play, positioning, etc), and distribution skills.   Each Focus can be broken down into different drills.  <br>  <br>  Instead of writing a novel I found this website and looked  it over that does a pretty good job in cover the basic goalkeeper drills: <a href="http://www.jbgoalkeeping.com/training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jbgoalkeeping.com/training.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Tips: <br>  <br>  Footwork: Start and end practice with footwork drills. <br>  Hands: When you are warming-up, stretching, doing sit-ups, doing pushes ups, etc always incorporate the ball into the exercise.   <br>  <br>  Proper Technique: Repetition, Repetition, Repetition.  Service is key in building proper technique and confidence. <br>  <br>  At the end of the season, if you are still interesting in playing goalie I would recommend you look into attending a goalkeeper camp to really help you fine tune your skills. <br>  <br>  Good luck this season!|`|TDlvBrd9aa	well first you cant be fat to be a goalie and if you are than I'm sad to say that you cant be a goalie.<br>  now that we go that out of the way,do crunches and push ups obviously to increase your strength,stretching for at least 30 mins a day.<br>  squats are really good for your jumping and kicking.<br>  when you do all those exercises be sure to do them until failure.<br>  That's all really i can say for a starting keeper.<br>  <br>  P.S if you are fat you still can be a keeper but you will have to work extra hard to get into shape.
dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	It is illegal for minors to compete in mixed martial art competitions in the state of Ohio...but you can train. There are several places in Toledo, Ohio...just go to yahoo local and type in martial arts.<br>  <br>  That being said I would recommend that you try classes at each one before signing up as they will be expensive in Toledo. The cheapest MMA schools around our area are Hill's Martial Arts in Edgerton, Ohio and Pil Sung Victory MMA in Defiance, Ohio. I know both of the people who teach at those schools and they are decent in MMA but Pil Sung is more active in competitions. Keep in mind that you may train but you will not be permitted to legally fight in Ohio...|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	oh, boy, and let me guess, you ride a gixxer right?

AA12274507	It was probably hitting lower in the colder temperature. The barrel will contract coupled with the increased drag the thicker cold air creates. Where in the heck where you shooting in that cold?|`|KDOIKIq2aa	Yes.  A colder barrel will/can throw to a different point of impact than a warm barrel.  Add to that cold ammunition will has a loss of velocity.  The colder it is the more velocity lost.  Then colder air is thicker/heavier than warm air and will put more drag on the bullet in flight.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	I'm guessing the extreme cold affects the rubber seals if it has them and that might do it.....................

J9bqxogLaa	The ,38 +P will work fine in your Taurus but it's recommended that you don't shoot a lot of +P ammo through any .38. It causes lots of stress on the gun. Practice with regular .38s and save the +Ps for things like self defense.<br>  <br>  I would have to advise against taking a .38 into bear country. It could be effective if you are close enough to stick it the bear's mouth and pull the trigger, but by then it's too late. You'd have to use the last round on yourself. <br>  <br>  I understand this might not be an option for you, but if a handgun was my only choice I'd go with nothing smaller than a .44 magnum with Winchester Silvertips. It kicks like a mule, but you won't notice it if you have to defend yourself against a bear.<br>  <br>  You could always try pepper spray and little bells..... (pay special attention to the last paragraph on the sign.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.weirduniverse.net/bear_sign.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.weirduniverse.net/bear_sign...</a>|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes *|`|QNX9NET3aa	You need to research your gun through Taurus and see if it is rated to handle+p ammo. Some Taurus .38's can handle 38 +p some can't.|`|uChkvc5qaa	The +P is a good round but I wouldn't want to try to take on a bear with it. Just do a little research about how to seal up your food properly, make plenty of noise and I'm sure that the only use your gun will have is to make you feel better. Bears are not usually social animals, so if they know your there, they won't be.|`|oZj6DfpKaa	I would not shoot +P ammunition in a Taurus, I would not even consider taking a 38 to use against a bear, you would just make it mad and injure it, which is more dangerous than it being mad alone.  Get a couple canisters of bear pepper spray and then hope you don't have to use it.  Save the 38 for wild cats.|`|AA11295048	Golden Sabers are designed to stop human aggressors not bears you would be better served with the 158 grain soft points because of the superior penetration.|`|RYDSc5Bqaa	Stay away from the +P ammo for your revolver's sake. What you need is a lead flat nose or semi-wadcutter 158 grain bullet. When shooting tough animals you want penetration. A slow heavy bullet will do that and if you use a lead bullet it will deform and cause more damage. Remember, the American Bison were slaughtered by large, slow, lead bullets. Most current hollowpoint ammo is made for self defense and designed to function on humans. The Hornady XTP is good for hunting but the .38's velocity is too slow to get both penetration and expansion from the bullet. Try Grizzly ammo company. They make a 158 grain Wide Flat Nose at 750 feet per second.

That said, if you're going to be plinking at 50 feet, I doubt you'll notice much difference between the various pellets.

CBVlu3Gvaa	To Clarify.....the Rule you refer to is not based on the type of groove.....IE U shaped or V groove.   It is based on the width of the grooves.  Mizuno uses V groove to my understanding.|`|nkPMesJdaa	The Mizuno mp-60's have a "modified" u groove. They are designed, according to Mizuno, for maximum control. It was never clear exactly, however, it appears v grooves are used for the lower clubs (1,2,3,4,5) and U grooves for higher clubs. The changes to club grooves in 2010 will be to lessen the degree of sharpness on the grooves edges (rounded vs squared egde). Just to fill you in, the rule change will only effect pros in 2010 and "upper level" amateur tournaments beginning in 2014. According to the rules, if you are an amateur NOT playing high level tournament golf, any club made before 2010 will be legal to play until 2024 or longer. Hope this helps. Gorilla
GVUkCcwxaa	Golf. Takes away your stress. You always have to push yourself and will always be trying to achieve better. Mixed Martial Arts and Muay Thai is great too. All of these sports take great dedication and even though golf doesn't seem like it, you need great physical ability and fitness to become good.|`|82Vo9DXCaa	best sport is football<br>  hardest sport is wrestling, so if you really want to challenge and discipline yourself you should do this|`|W89vZy3Naa	I would say either hockey or soccer. Both sports you are constantly moving either short or no breaks.|`|BvYSsgd5aa	best is baseball hardest...gymnastics damn those little girls do some crazy stuff|`|Twzg9s0caa	Hockey.<br>  Fast and allows creativity.<br>  Rules all, eh!|`|sBeZWl35aa	I like baseball, but the hardest is probably hockey
gUMucKOkaa	Well, at the moment, Barmes is not certain to have a position although I think that he will win the 2B job. Still, I like Greene, particularly in his new home. His offensive production should pick up. Over his career he has been much better on the road than at Petco.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|UoT86gbiaa	The reasonable option would be suicide. <br>  But since this is an unreasonable question I'll take Barmes and his 3-position eligibility.|`|O3oqZsR3aa	I would say Barmes. more consistent, will hit for average and plays in the all too hitter friendly Coors field. While Khalil Greene doesn't hit for a very high average, didn't last season and plays in a park the size of Wyoming...slight exaggeration. <br>  <br>  anyways i would go with barmes, seems like the better option. if it were for the glove though i would take greene and since in fantasy a glove doesn't matter go with Barmes.|`|560bTFitaa	I'd take Greene.  He's moving out of a pitcher's ballpark and has demonstrated good power in the past.  He's a bit of an injury risk and will hurt your average.  But he's the type of scrappy player that does well in St. Louis.
3Yo4qsnVaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeUjuWpXnv8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeUjuWpXn...</a>|`|yTqMSAd2aa	good question. <br>  look I am a Barca fan, but above all, I am a football fan. meaning I prefer to see the most entertaining game, whichever one is better, I would watch it. i have great memories of beautiful game where my team lost or tied.<br>  2005 Chelsea Vs Barca 4-2. and absolute cracker of a game.<br>  <br>  2005 Real Madrid Vs barcelona 4-2. just out of this world.<br>  <br>  2006 Barca Vs Real madrid 3-3. the best game ever for my money.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds wierd but that's just the way i am. and that's why my favorite team is barca. they know how to bring entertainment while winning at the same time.|`|OVIlekcVaa	Marco you know had Chelsea attacked yesterday it would not had been a draw. It would had been embarrassment and they just wanted to limit the damage to a 1-0 or 2-0 loss.<br>  Chelsea's attack can't keep up with Bar?a's.<br>  Like I told you yesterday, we didn't win it because we missed our chances but Chelsea did nothing special and waved the white flag...|`|mgzmnPEraa	Hell yeah i would love my team to annailate the other team but although a 3-3 tie would be more entertaining it wont have as musch great feeling as of beating them 3-0|`|w4ec69oCaa	first choice :)|`|WS8MvKQAaa	theres a scary girl after me, I'm in hiding:(|`|VpiYSQVnaa	if it was my team...the first one...and the reasoning is simple, every fan wants their team to dominate and win
xQgciq09aa	Didn't suprise me.<br>  <br>  They have been looking a lot better since they moved Brooks to the starting point.<br>  <br>  He's a much better fit for their offensive scheme than Alston.|`|sOae9LUzaa	I've actually been expecting this type of defense from the Rockets the whole year. You have 2 of the best defenders in Ronny and Shane. Not to mention, Yao-Ming, the tallest player right now (I think) to take post for offense.|`|GERlmBIUaa	I actually thought rockets cuz i know that they can play d but every1 doesnt no em so they dont know how good they are even without tracy mcgrady...|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Not me. Rockets got lucky tonight.
hzttr76Maa	If LeBron is stopped from driving, and is forced to take jumpshots, he won't be the same LeBron dunking for 35 every night. It's not like he's Ray Allen behind the paint. The Cavs are led by LeBron, and about 55-65% of their team is all LeBron. The Cavs are not a one-man team, becuase they have Mo. (All-Star), Big Z...<br>  <br>  BQ: Mamba. It's deadlier!|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	It wasn't just LeBron playing badly. Most of the guys were missing their shots. So no the Cavs is not a 1 man team anymore. It was a bad night for the whole team not just LBJ. The Cavs win games even with LBJ scoring below his average.<br>  <br>  BQ: Neither, the Rapist will win the race and not get charged.|`|P93I8CHtaa	i still believe its all just a one man show for sure<br>  <br>  BQ:spider crab,black mambas are slow|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	We played better with LeBron on the bench today. <br>  <br>  Sometimes LeBron's bad games bring the team down. That's why when LeBron has a bad night the Cavs usually lose. <br>  <br>  I still think the Cavs are a solid team, with plenty of depth. <br>  <br>  And all I know is that LeBron is not 44-12. The Cavs are. <br>  <br>  I STILL CAN'T GET OVER THE FACT THAT LEBRON HAD 0 ASSISTS TODAY!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Your point has some validity, but LeBron has had bad nights and the Cavs have won. Those types of games tend to happen in Cleveland. <br>  <br>  Man, I wish every game was in Cleveland. We would own. lol|`|8KYQkQzaaa	They aren't really a 1 man team now with Mo and Z shooting well. Boobie Gibson is great from behind the arc. J.J. is great energy off the bench. But really it all starts with Lebron, whether he is the one scoring or the one dishing assists. If Lebron is not shooting well and can't get to the basket pretty much not taking over the game then he needs to get his teammates involved. But as you can see tonight he had a bad shooting performance AND 0 assists. So Lebron needs to do one of the 2 and the cavs will be fine, but if he doesn't do any of the 2 the Cavs fall apart. <br>  <br>  In the end if the Cavs don't have Lebron it is a disaster. So a one-man team indeed.<br>  <br>  And lol, a Black Mamba. just because.|`|uFctHPExaa	This is what I was saying for the longest when everyone was trying to say the cavs supporting cast is underrated.now everybody knows what i meant even though i said it a while ago.Lebron is a one man team.the players on his team just make easy shots because lebron goes to the hole and gets double teamed.besides mo williams and delonte west nobody on that team can create there own shot.thats why i was laughing when people was saying the cavs supporting cast is underrated|`|H8u7gMAYaa	No. Mo Williams is obviously their second best player. Plus, Big Z, and some great shooters in Gibson, Wally and a pretty good bench.<br>  <br>  They definately aren't a one man show. If they were, they would not have the record they have now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Cavs, don't trip. Every great player has that sort of game. He will bounce back.|`|zNO8flyCaa	no i don't they are a full team now they use team work and know they are moving the ball shooting and scoring they are a team now but to answer the other question kobe all day|`|WLXFAeSnaa	No<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ: Black Mamba|`|HctRxF1laa	no cuz idk lebron is just the ****|`|RKWTxuz4aa	The most one man team is the heat.<br>  <br>  They have Dwayne wade and no one else..|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Yes<br>  <br>  They R A one man Team|`|TZy1f27vaa	PHUK ME MC ...PHUK ME|`|xQgciq09aa	I don't get to see them play very often but, they looked very unprepared against the Rockets, and that's not LeBron's fault.<br>  <br>  They weren't doubling Yao fast enough, their big men didn't take the fouls, forcing James to challenge Yao and Scola, getting him into foul trouble, and they didn't move well without the ball, to give James any good passing options when he was doubled.<br>  <br>  Those are not things you have to be a more talented player to do.  You just have to hustle and play smarter.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	No can guard or stop LeBron James.He goes over 30-40 points a game,there are guys like Kobe,Bowen and etc.That can hel him on 25 points.But Cavs offense doesn't go on LeBron any time same means for Lakers offense too,they don't go just on Kobe.LeBron knows to pass and play sone great defense.And when he's motived,the hall team is too.So if you want to beat the Cavs.You can't stop LeBron but you can win if you control the paint and boards1!!!!!1
QrjuueMCaa	I have. Last spring, one of the local meth cooks decided they wanted what was in my home.<br>  <br>  He took a round in the upper stomach and out the opposite gluteus. Dropped like a rock when the .45 HP tore thru him.<br>  <br>  I have finally got my name cleared and my gun back.<br>  <br>  If I had to do it again, I wouldn't stop pulling the trigger.<br>  <br>  Be glad you havn't. It is a humbling experience. I wish it would have never happened to me.<br>  <br>  Our kids still have nightmares of when they came up the stairs and saw him laying in a huge pile of blood and bawling like a stuck pig.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Never had to shoot anyone, but I've seen a guy back up in a hurry when staring down the barrel of a 357.  He called the cops.  The cops said we should have shot the guy.  They were tired of dealing with him on a nearly weekly basis.  As a matter of fact, he was charged and plead guilty to assault with a deadly weapon.  He had a pick in his hand when my father drew his 357.  Just like a criminal to bring a digging utensil to a gunfight.  My father faced no charges.|`|DHIudHy2aa	I haven't but I guarantee someone here has, or will say they have too I guess.|`|AA12243350	A person that has, isn't going to be too keen on talking about it. No one wants to take a life, and anyone who sounds enthusiastic about doing so, is an idiot. Anyone who brags about having done so, is probably full if it.<br>  I've been on both ends of firearms. Taking a human life is a life altering experience. You will never be the same again. I've seen men fall apart and give up their career after a shooting. I've seen others become "wyatt Earp" in their own mind, real jerks. Others become withdrawn, others can't handle it and take their own life as a result. A few, seem to remain the same on the outside, but who knows what is inside them. No, I won't talk about it for your video, sorry. I'll ask a few friends if they will, but I can pretty much answer for them with a "no thanks".<br>  Shoot safe|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Thank God I've not yet been forced to shoot anyone.  Thankfully every time I've had to draw my gun in self-defense, someone remembered an urgent appointment they were late for on the other side of the county.  I did nothing  to make them any later.<br>  <br>  Doc
A7PkhsDJaa	That would suck. Kozlov (or should I say Oleg Prudius) should have stuck with judo. He has no personality or ring skills. Plus, he has been in the WWE for the less than a year. Why would he be main-eventing Wrestlemania 25 with two of the greatest wrestlers of all time?|`|7BS1L0oBaa	Shawn Michaels is not offically facing taker<br>  <br>  HBK is facing Kozlov on Raw and the winner of that will face taker at WM 25|`|86kZ5uYwaa	lol<br>  But that's probably whats going to happen.<br>  I'd be pretty upset because I really wanted to see a one on one match between two of Wwe's greats.|`|TzCu3igraa	i would go crazy but it won't happen because we all know, even the writers know that the fans want taker vs hbk 1 on 1|`|AA11179568	i love it<br>  i want takers record to stop<br>  vladimir would stop it<br>  and taker needs to retire im so tired of watching him not lose or if he loses he'll fight and fight the same opponent until he wins in a casket match that is boring i really think he should retire<br>  not that im a hater but im really bored when i see taker|`|8iRi6hqSaa	that will be gay wwe want vladimirro kozlove to become a big star but it should only be a one on 1 match because it will be longer and better|`|4eQqTiYwaa	id hope hbk and taker just tombstone and super kick the **** outta him till he cant move , then they can have a normal match|`|An10In6daa	I would feel very disappointed.|`|eR2puwq4aa	WRESTLING IS FAKE<br>  <br>  <br>  END OF STORY|`|0Z0onKvdaa	dont care taker sucks ***|`|4tvI9WYjaa	i shot vince lol<br>  i put kozlov in a smackdown vs raw vs ecw match|`|gpNIG15eaa	Why not put JBL along with him?Then Undertaker will have all three victims at Wrestlemania 25 and his record will be 17-0.

6LQNK51uaa	Bret Hart vs Kurt Angle would be a classic wrestling match but than also this match is no match for Undertaker vs HBK b/c fans like me r waiting for this match since 1996.|`|DgwqNbWKaa	the greatest of all time hbk. harts a whiny ***** who was always sad because hbk was better|`|Nmjjqoybaa	Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker<br>  <br>  Legend Vs Legend<br>  Showstopper Vs. Undefeated<br>  Mr.Wrestlemania vs Streak|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I'd have to go with Bret Hart vs Kurt Angle.  I don't like either men but their technical and submission abilities in the ring are so closely matched it'd make for an incredible match.<br>  <br>  Shawn and Undertaker would be a good match but their so different in their styles that I don't think they'd be able to hold the crowd as well.  Shawn is a technical wrestler while Undertaker is a brawler.  Their differences would certainly make the battle unique but Bret and Angle use the same skills and techniques that i'd be like watching them wrestler themselves and it would be so even you'd be able to cut it down the middle!!!|`|NRs72Afxaa	Shawn Michaels and Undertaker has already been done.<br>  <br>  I would be interested in the Bret Hart vs Kurt Angle match. If Bret Hart had more match left in him then Kurt Angle would be the wise choice. Kurt is the best in the business today, and Bret is a legend in this business. I think it would of been a good match back, and it probably could work today.  I doubt it, but never say never.|`|nQHkkR8Raa	Taker and HBK because it would be legendary. And angle is in TNA!|`|bSsBGrZVaa	HBK vs Undertaker|`|ePvvGUu3aa	Not taking anything away from Hart vs. Angle, but it would be Michaels vs. Undertaker. I mean no disrespect to the Hart vs. Angle match, I would just find the opposing match more better.<br>  <br>  As we all know, Undertaker and Shawn Michaels are established legends (like Hart and Angle) and have been known for being two of the great performers, which actually really can't be described with words. Everything Hart vs. Angle would have would be what Michaels vs. Undertaker would have, but Undertaker and Shawn Michaels would have something extra. Which is making the match as emotional as possible and story telling that would actually be a novel to the fans viewing the match.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	In a pure wrestling standpoint - Bret Hart vs Kurt Angle would be better.<br>  <br>  In a performance standpoint - Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker.<br>  <br>  Why? Bret and Angle are two of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time. Seeing those 2 work together would just be amazing.<br>  <br>  I don't want to take away from Shawn Michaels vs the Undertaker. This is definitely a match I would beg to see but in pure wrestling, Bret and Kurt take it here...|`|foRnM8Lbaa	As much as I hate to say it as I don't like HBK, Michaels vs. the Undertaker. I will be rooting for the Undertaker--I would like to see him beat him with the gogoplata renamed by Don Vinnie as the Hell's Gate.  I understand the Gracie family and Judo World Champion Mike Swain have asked Mr. McMahon to rename  all classic ju jitsu and judo moves as he sees fit.|`|gpNIG15eaa	In their prime,it'd be Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker because those two wrestlers were undoubtedly the best wrestlers of WWF/E and are still serving for long.Now,if Shawn Michaels were to face Undertaker,it would be a match of two legends.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Kurt Angle vs Bret Hart <br>  <br>  Damn Is Technical vs Technical <br>  <br>  No Doubt|`|KIOR56r6aa	Undertaker vs HBK<br>  <br>  Undefeated vs Showstopper, need to say more?|`|A7PkhsDJaa	HBK vs. Undertaker. Why? Because that is obviously what you want to hear.|`|qF1oQG7Xaa	I think undertaker vs HBK.<br>   <br>  Angle against hart would be good, two very good wrestlers, could be a good match, but hart has retired now, so he could slow the match down, and angle is in TNA, so it is unlikely.<br>   <br>  However, taker against HBK is a match we have been waiting for years to see, it could happen this year. The giant, against this smaller man, could he defy the odds and win, if it is at wrestlemania, the 16 to 0 against MR wrestlemania, so that would be amazing. I'd predict shocks from that, big moves, and a thrilling ending.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Hart/Angle will be special i think. We have already seen HBK/Undertaker a lot in the past, they were gud matches but hart/angle will be really great one. This is what fans will die to see like undertaker/sting match.|`|313c56ee41b0ac0b7a96bc177ee6784aaa	I'd like to see them both equally as much.

And Undertaker vs HBK, we'll probably see some Holy Sh*t moments in that match.|`|TzCu3igraa	hbk vs taker<br>  <br>  because, angle and hart mostly base their performances around wrestling whereas the phenom and the showstoppa base theirs around wrestling and entertaining|`|8iRi6hqSaa	as much as i want to see  shawn vs undertaker i'd say bret vs kurt<br>  <br>  becaus e sharpshooter vs angle lock<br>  in a summision match|`|Cn9gUBamaa	HBK vs. Undertaker.

I think I might be wrong though, but anyways they lost so it wasn't that great.<br>  <br>  I think Kobe would of got 50 tonight if he played heavy minutes like Wade does every night.

U5ANBu9oaa	i beg to differ will these statements that you need a main eventer.<br>  take JBL. infamous for his many dark stable memberships and now hes the rich cowboy uppermidcarder that every1 loves to hate.<br>  this all UK stable would make for an interesting push for a few of the younger guys like Gabriel and Burchill. or it can crash like FBI when they switched from ECW to WWE. but i would like to see it. I would also like to see Sheamus in WWE in general. hed be an amazing heel on any of the brands.(better then that Kozlov.)|`|aIhVHfMUaa	2 things are missing, you need a Main Eventer to be the leader of any good stable, Regal isnt big enough to be in charge, also you need a dedicated strong man, such as Evolution had with Batista and that Ministry had with Viscera<br>  <br>  just for the record as well, Finlay is also irish, well his character is anyway|`|H7p09fL2aa	it would be good but i think they should have one big member to be the henchman or something like that<br>  like ministry with viscera<br>  and evolution with batista|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Maybe, it could be something like the Young Canadians were, if you think about it.|`|bBHlGs5waa	I think that it would work.

My mistake I see he signed another deal with the Redskins. The Redskins are one team that I thought was over the cap.

Yao should be able to dominate the NBA with his height and today he showed the damage he can do if he doesn't play like a pussy. During the dunk "on" LeBron James, LeBron tried to block Yao from behind, but Yao barely has to jump to dunk, so Yao dunked, and James slightly hit his arm which would be a foul. I wouldn't say "on" James, but Rocket's defense played great.|`|zNO8flyCaa	yeah that was cool man i loved it he is a beast i think there going in a good Direction for there team and the lakers will probably win by 20 or more points|`|yEe5ysKvaa	no,i did not.|`|m2I26k2qaa	Nope I didn't see it.

dfBwVxXFaa	the process starts at the same time, but because the bullet is traveling so much faster, it is long gone before the action is opened completely.  You may lose a bit of velocity, because it is using some of the energy to cycle the action, but it is not enough to worry about. You will notice a difference in recoil between say a bolt action and a semi-auto.|`|HdSaN24caa	when you pull that trigger, the bullet is gone before the bolt begins the reverse motion. the gas behind the bullet goes into the hole in the barrel to the gas tube, which causes the rearward movement of the bolt, which ejects the empty shell.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	The bullet is out of the barrel before the bolt moves.  Usually the bolt is operated by excess gas that is vented towards the end of the barrel.  The gas then moves back through a piston to operate the bolt.  By then, the bullet is well on its way.  If it is a simple blow back design, there is usually some sort of delay built into it to keep it locked until the pressure is clear of the barrel.  If the bolt was to open on a pressurized barrel, it would sure get your attention.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Luckyno7 is right you will experience less recoil and it saps away energy from the FPS.<br>  <br>  Their are two different ways a semi auto rifle works "blow back" and "gas operated". <br>  <br>  Gas operated starts tapping off the spent gases before the bullet leaves, but both react the same way opening the bolt a Milli second after the bullet has left.<br>  <br>  <br>  and small caliber pistols are Recoil operated|`|FjiRPKp2aa	The bolt recoils after the bullet leaves the barrel. Because the escaping gases are what make the bolt action operate. The gases cannot escape until the shell leaves the cartridge thus releasing the gas.At the speed of velocity a bullet travels it is likely that the bullet will be out of the barrel before enough pressure is released to open the bolt.|`|J9bqxogLaa	No lost velocity with a semi-auto. The bullet is long gone by the time recoil is initiated.<br>  <br>  Barrel length has more to do with bullet velocity than if it's a semi-auto or not. Longer barrel, slightly higher velocity.

MnjOXJnJaa	to win a ring, Houston needs a healthy Olajuwon. seriously. with or without McGrady, they were/are a longshot this year. the West isn't as tough as the last few years, but that doesn't mean they can get past LA and San Antonio in a 7 game series. as close as they seem to be, there is still a big gap... and they won't close it completely unless they make big moves. which is to say it ain't happening this year. but i DID enjoy their performance against Cleveland.|`|PqmmyV6baa	Well a healthy McGrady is always better than no McGrady, but in the Rockets case no McGrady is better than an injured one. The Rockets are doing pretty good without McGrady. We are on a 6 game winning streak, and won 17-6 without him. That's really good. And with Alston gone Brooks gets to start as the point guard and that's been good. We've had better ball movement without them. I was really sad that they traded Alston and sometimes I still have my doubts, but without him we are better. Yeah I miss him but if it means for us to win a title without him then let him go. As for McGrady a healthy one is nessasary, but it's not a we need. I believe that if the Rockets keep playing at the pace their playing in then they will surely get out of the first round. Believe on it.<br>  <br>  GO ROCKETS!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9mtMw9Qaaa	NO T-MAC=POSSIBLE PLAYOFF CHANCE<br>  100% T-MAC=POSSIBLE RING.....<br>  BUT I THINK THEY NEED BETTER OUTSIDE SHOOTING|`|ffc512a2f830415686f185cea26f3dfcaa	I completely agree with you. The rockets can only win a championship with a 100% healthy T-mac but without him i don't think they have a chance.|`|h8LVh29Oaa	Yes. Without him they are doomed forever.|`|MSMem5qYaa	No...They are better without him....but with TMAC gone they lose leadership I think... but even so I think they can win big....based on the Cleveland game tonight.......|`|NmXKPDoIaa	-They need the 2003 T-MAC, to win a title.|`|F6u6zfLUaa	no not really but he would help|`|uxregJ0faa	No but a healthy Tmac would give them a little boost.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kinda like Lakers. We dont need Bynum but he gives us a  boost that makes us better.|`|xQgciq09aa	If they can keep beating the best teams in the league, without T-Mac to help them, maybe they don't.<br>  <br>  T-Mac won't be 100% until next season at the earliest, so they will have to go for it without him, if they want to win it this year.|`|75GcSkF6aa	I don't think there will ever be a 100% healthy mcgrady<br>  <br>  Rockets need to move on<br>  <br>  if there is still people pinning their hopes on this guy<br>  well that just makes me sad<br>  <br>  Rockets have to resign Ron<br>  <br>  tmac rocket career=over|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Well without him they can get rid of the first round curse.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	No they don't they have Artest in place of him.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Yes
snzTUrJsaa	It depends on which reef. The world's many reefs have different and unique ecosystems and organisms.

AA11865915	I've been a lifelong Dodger fan & when the signing period started, I really wanted them to sign Raul Ibanez.<br>  <br>  No luck, he signed w/ the Phils pretty early. So then as the weeks passed & Abreu was still out there, I was thinking that he would be a good fit in the outfield at Chavez Ravine.<br>  <br>  The Dodgers never seemed to be real interested & he went to sign across the I-5 at Anaheim. I was never too enamored with the idea of getting Dunn only because he strikes out too damn much & his defense isn't any better than Manny's.<br>  <br>  So now we're left w/ the soap opera of Manny & the Dodgers, the early vote getters of the "will-they-won't-they" couple of the year. I just know it down in my gut that as soon as Manny gets what he wants he'll dog it just like he did in Beantown.|`|vQcjZAGPaa	The Dodgers choose to keep offering him money because no matter what he does off the field or in the club house. He still puts up quality numbers on the field. In 53 games with the Dodgers he had good solid stats.<br>  <br>  Hits: 74<br>  Avg: .396<br>  HR: 17<br>  RBI: 53<br>  <br>  And those closely mirror his 2007 season with the Red Sox. When he played 133 games<br>  <br>  Hits: 143<br>  Avg: .299<br>  HR: 20<br>  RBI: 88<br>  <br>  When a team takes on Manny. They take on and expect his antics. Like everyone says its just "Manny being Manny" As long as he puts up solid numbers and stays out of legal troubles or out of the steroid fiasco he can pretty much write his own ticket. He does bring along a lot of publicity, negative and positive. He also helps his team win, plain and simple. And if they don't sign him. Well...Those would be some big shoes to fill for his replacement. And if the Dodgers do not give him the deal he wants. Another team will always be in line to give him that deal he is looking for.<br>  <br>  Oh and I am a Braves fan myself.|`|nb4VGxH7aa	Anyone who bats in front of Manny gets better pitches and inflated statistics and whoever bats behind Manny gets lots of chances for RBI's. He also brings in lots of revenue. He is the same reason we all enjoyed Bonds in San Francisco. I agree Bobby Abreu would be a good signing for the Dodgers with our weak division. Adam Dunn is not a good teammate though. He would rather takes shots of Jack Daniels and party all night then think about the pitcher in the upcoming game, or practice defense. Eventually, Manny will be a Dodger once again because he really does not have any other options but it really will not make the Dodgers a clear favorite in the West. The pitching staff is unproven and possibly horrid. To see how Manny Ramirez effects teammates stats, see David Ortiz. For more proof, see Jeff Kent when batting before Bonds or Rich Aurillia.|`|AA10441760	They loved having him there last year, but honestly don't see any point in overbidding. They are doing it the right way pretty much, you've got to figure it's only a matter of time before Boras(who I would say is mostly behind this) gives in to the reasonable offers they've been getting.|`|U3KAgO0baa	Because they know that they are a marginal  playoff team without him... And a Legit Contender in the national league, And Possibly 2 Win The World Series.|`|zJC18FtAaa	Im a Dodgers fan i think there good without out him but with him in the lineup just makes us better <br>  i am worried though if do sign him he gets lazy and acts dumb like in Boston|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	yea they needed to checkout other outfielder who are good even raul ibanez would of been a great sign hes good but also good in clubhouse|`|3pLv7KBvaa	without manny they wnot make it to the playoffs and i dont think you got to worry about "giants sigining him. as the only people who made an offer are  dodgers.|`|c6q3EERdaa	Manny has to realize that the Dodgers are the only team willing to sign him for what he wants. Manny and the Dodgers need to come to some sort of agreement, because they need each other - Manny for a job and the Dodgers for a playoff contender.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Simple.  He's a great baseball player and he helps a lineup a lot.  Not only does he put up numbers himself, but whoever is hitting in front of him will generally see better pitches.  Also, he wasn't a team cancer with the Dodgers last season.  As long as he's happy, he's a great addition.  The problem is when things start to go bad, then he turns into a cancer, and thats one reason why the Dodgers are fine with 1 or 2 years, but don't want to go long term.<br>  <br>  As for comparing Manny to Abreu or Dunn, don't even think about going there.  Manny hit .332 last season, .396 with the Dodgers, and 37 HRs.  Dunn couldn't hit .332 off a tee.  He hit .236 with 40 HRs, I'll give up 3 HRs for nearly .100 points in avg, more like 150 if you're just talking Manny's NL time.  Manny is a far better player, but thats why he's able to ask for what he does.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	With the single, small exception of the 1993 Indians, where he played in only 22 September games, that "team cancer" has NEVER played on a losing team.<br>  <br>  That's not all about Manny, frankly it's kinda weird, but it cannot be avoided -- Ramirez's teams have won, and consistently.<br>  <br>  And now, he and Boras want to win this free agency. They walked away from 2 years and $40M in Boston -- so they really don't want to take equal or less, and that's for money AND years. So a two-year deal just isn't going to be good enough.<br>  <br>  And, for whatever reasons, Boras simply hasn't been able to drum up more interest, either real or phantom, for Ramirez's services.<br>  <br>  Ramirez is an amazingly talented hitter but appears to have severely overplayed his hand during this offseason. I don't care where he ends up, and am puzzled as to why so many others do.|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Simple without Manny The Dodgers are really nothing that's why they continue pursuing his services. If Manny does sign he might be a jackass and act like he was in Boston. And I don't think that Abreu or Dunn as good as they are would have the type of impact Manny had not only with the players but also putting people in the stands.|`|utTFiz3gaa	I thought FOR SURE that Manny would be a Dodger because quite frankly what other team/fanbase really visibly showed and/or talked about wanting him back and loving him?<br>  <br>  he's so dumb just go to the team who wants you! its a lot of money too!|`|P93I8CHtaa	im a giants fan and i hope they DO sign him<br>  <br>  manny is greedy for more money
sOae9LUzaa	Horry would be a huge factor. He's the ring man, where teams he goes to usually wins rings (For example, Lakers and Spurs)|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah they are going to need a veteran player and he will make key contributions.|`|Rhk35LUcaa	no i dont think horry is a factor anymore, you could see he was done after seeing him in last years playoffs|`|Hjy0qwFPaa	No way and how that's ever happening|`|DkwgogXZaa	that would be an interesting sign....horry going for his 8th...unbelievable

There was no greetings before the game.|`|vJyF8siJaa	58 points from the Lakers bench that's the story.
piZ4xDBqaa	Not in the pros.  These guys are all getting paid to play, and everyone plays by the same rules.  The Lakers and the Suns have the same salary cap, and if the Lakers are that much better, then the Suns have no one to blame but themselves.<br>  <br>  It's different in college, where you can have a big state school running up the score against some second division school that has maybe a tenth of the athletic budget.  Kids in college and high school are playing for the fun of it, and running up the score just for it's own sake is just wrong.  Sometimes it's justified, if your team needs an impressive win to make the NCAA tournament or gain some votes, but most of the time it's just some coach feeding his ego.|`|zxKCVXPZaa	Games are played in four quarters of 10 (international) or 12 minutes (NBA). College games use two 20 minute halves while most high school games use eight minute quarters. Fifteen minutes are allowed for a half-time break, and two minutes are allowed at the other breaks. Overtime periods are five minutes long. Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I hate when people use that excuse for bad D. What's wrong with putting points on the scoreboard?<br>  <br>  Isn't that what your suppose to do? it's not a crime to keep scoring.. that's what your suppose to do in the first place. So, don't make excuses for a team playing horrible D.|`|nBqZBbtnaa	How is playing your bench trash (Lakers bench trash is gold for most teams) running up the score?<br>  Do you think it's poor sportsmanship to be so jealous of a team's success that you make a comment as stupid as this?|`|Y32OY6PAaa	Ok im pretty sure your talking about the lakers. No its not poor because the bench played the whole 4th quarter. They are just that good!

eEjcEZ8gaa	in addition to a good desk, chair, and proper lighting, I'd start with the following:<br>  <br>  1. A vise that will reliably hold the size range of hooks you'll be tying on.  Rotary or non-rotary is a personal choice, as is clamp or pedestal base.  I'd take a good non-rotary over a cheap (Danica) rotary any day.  For a solid, reliable, entry level vise, look at Griffin.  Excellent hook holding, made in the US, and superior customer service.<br>  <br>  2. A high quality scissor.  Serrated blades seem to perform better over time.  Anvil is a good, moderately priced product.<br>  <br>  3. A cheaper, heavier scissor for rough work.  Cutting hair and synthetics wears out good scissors, so use your more expensive set for tasks that require delicate work.<br>  <br>  4. At least one bobbin.  Ceramic tubes and ceramic inserts are common today, but the standard Matarelli is also a great choice.  Tube lengths vary, and tyers have their own preferences.  Having more than one bobbin can be convenient at times, but it's not necessary.  Also keep in mind that ceramic tubes are somewhat fragile and can be destroyed if dropped on tile or concrete.<br>  <br>  5. Hackle plier.  Many different styles are available.  The "English" style has been in use for generations, but more modern designs are available from Dorin, Thompson, Griffin and others.<br>  <br>  The above comprise a pretty basic tool kit.  Add the following as you wish.<br>  <br>  Whip finisher.  Matarelli style or Thompson style, though most go with the former.  Whip finishers aren't mandatory, and some tyers prefer to use whip finish by hand or use a half-hitch tool.  Either case, a cheap whip finisher will still last the rest of your tying life.<br>  <br>  Hair stacker.  Evening the tips of natural hair is next to impossible without a good hair stacker.  I've used many different products over the years and prefer my Edgin set of stackers.  Make sure the size you get is practical for your tying.<br>  <br>  Half hitch tool.  Sure, you can make your own form a ball point pen, but you can buy a nice brass tool that won't snag your thread for just a couple dollars.<br>  <br>  Nail clipper.  Use it for cutting lead, tinsel, and wire.  Using scissors on these will quickly destroy the blades, so go with a 50 cent clipper instead.<br>  <br>  Razor blades.  Double edged blades are the standard for trimming spun hair heads and bodies.  A pack of 10 blades (20 usable edges) will set you back less than $2.  Single edged blades don't work nearly as well.<br>  <br>  Hair packer.  Necessary for creating tightly packed spun hair bodies, like those seen on bass bugs.  Special use tool that not every tyer needs.<br>  <br>  Dubbing hook.  This is a handy tool for creating dubbed bodies using the "loop" method.  Many different styles available, but one is easily made at home if you wish.<br>  <br>  Bodkin.  Make your own with a large sewing needle.<br>  <br>  Bobbin threader.  The dumbest tool you can ever pay for.  Make your own, or learn to thread without it.<br>  <br>  Dubbing teaser.  Learn to make your own from a dentist's file or velcro.<br>  <br>  Hackle gauge.  Don't bother.  The hook you tie on is the best gauge.<br>  <br>  That should about cover it.  Just start with the basics and add what's necessary as time goes on.  Most tying tool kits include crappy tools, so buy right (individually) from the start.|`|mlGm0UDTaa	Basic  essentials are not a rotary vice<br>  <br>  Essentials are  a vice, bobbin (one), scissors. those are the essentials  <br>  <br>  Two bobbins  can  help   a rotary vice will make it easier but  the  basic essentials are a vice, bobbin and scissors.<br>  <br>  Shall we talk hair  stackers.......<br>  <br>  I've been tieing all my life I  have never  to this day  used a  whip finishe<br>  <br>  definately a  good  answer  for  me  Pete but not the  questioner|`|5bf66864f5e85f953cdb3ff01887ae4daa	You have received an excellent answer from Pete G. What i will mention is that buying the best you can afford(if your serious about fly tying) is your best option. I have collected most of my fly tying equipment (which fills my log fishing cabin in the yard) over a long time. Ive found that brands that make excellent fly tying tools are firstly Dr Slick-they make excellent fine tipped scissors, C&F design, make excellent ceramic bobbin holders, which make thread wraps quick and neat. Also Orvis makes some excellent fly tying tools which you may want to look into.|`|qU03Jegpaa	Thumbs up to Pete.<br>  Although  buying a kit is convenient. If you plan to get into fly tying a bit more than the average "beginner", I would definitely recommend cherry picking your tools.<br>    A good vise is really something worth putting a few bucks toward. It will last you for years.<br>  The ceramic bobbins that pete mentioned are really nice to work with also. If you plan on tying dry flies, you will probably need a hair stacker for a few of the more popular fly patterns.<br>  <br>  Here are a few links to some tools that I recommend as I use them myself.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kmdtackle.com/anvil-usa-apex-vise.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kmdtackle.com/anvil-usa-apex-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kmdtackle.com/ceramic-bobbin-assortment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kmdtackle.com/ceramic-bobbin-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kmdtackle.com/deluxe-tool-assortment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kmdtackle.com/deluxe-tool-ass...</a>|`|fSJrgVU7aa	The minimum tools should be as follows: A good vice, high quality scissors, at least two bobbins (hold spools of thread and other materials), bobbin threader, bodkin (small needle like tool with numerous uses), whip finisher for tying decent heads.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	i just whip up a few bucktails of sorts but a pair of 3x reading glasses,, really let you see where the nats butt an eyes  go..  ..|`|bGWcSAGCaa	I thought this would be a fun question to answer, but everyone beat me to it!

Yep!|`|TH1fT6rdaa	Yeah he should try out for Team America soccer goalie.<br>  Maybe then people would start watching soccer.|`|6qe9jeGOaa	you should be more concerned about your pistons and tell them to put stuckey on the bench cuz he's garbage and highly overrated.he's the main reason why the pistons been playing so poorly|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Hahahaha prolly.|`|xOvMH412aa	lol he look like a gorilla|`|Kwywmcs8aa	No he is usually playing Scrabble|`|H1VIZsutaa	In his off time from playing Soccer, Shaq is making all-star teams and scoring 17.4 points a game and getting 11.4 rebounds a game.
RS3fjNboaa	No, the redskins are already $3 million OVER the salary cap. Their hands are tied when it comes to signing big time free agents.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	No, simply because Big Al wants $100 mil. they could but they wont have much room for the rookies which i think is more of an important need rather then Big Al. There defense is actually really good. They need to work on that O-Line and getting some WRs.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	YES because Dan Snyder is like Barack Obama, Jerry Jones and Al Davis take them and Pay them.|`|8as63GSKaa	Yea, if you have been keeping up with the team the way I have you would have noticed that the skins restricted a couple of players contracts. We will get haynes, D hall will be back, and j taylor is already signed to be back so you don't have to worry about him. I don't think we will get haynes by giving him 100 mill up front i think we will do something like a 40 mill then beefing up the guarantied money to north of 30 mill. Now remember the 40 is stretched through how many ever seasons we have him. Therefore you will see some players like springs get released. And then next off season will be the time when the people who we restructured contracts may get released. If you understand|`|5B6w8mxVaa	no, but they always find away to sign their players anyway.<br>   Go COWBOYS!!!!!!!!!
daRDQE9maa	Albert Signed with the redskins, 7 years over 100 mill.. and for Derrick Brooks.. I really wish he'da just stayed in tampa, thats his home but i think he'll either go to another nfc south team ( Atlanta , New Orleans, or Carolina) just to stick it to the bucs, or i think he'll goto another tampa two system. but i think the saints should really look into him and or maybe philly...|`|U3KAgO0baa	I Think Fat Alber will be a Falcon.<br>  <br>  Brooks is only a top player, in a cover 2 D. So the best Option would be Indy.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	He'll end up wherever he's getting paid the most.  I think it will be either in Washington or Tampa.|`|CQcLHR0zaa	he should go to detroit =D|`|8ImkKoNEaa	i hope he stays with the titans. <br>  but we'll have to see!
xFfskbjYaa	say im the Colts coach.<br>  <br>  We Came TOO far to give it up now. Their defense, they showed up! And they have kicked our a.ss. Peyton, they have your number! Addai, what have you been doing? Its called a RUNNING game! Try that! They have dominated us for 3 quarters. But its the end of the fourth quarter that counts. That scoreboard, it means nothing till 15:00 turns to zero. It means NOTHING. We got 15 minutes to prove we belong here. We may not get another shot like this. Almost every FRANCHISE can count super bowl appearances on their fingers. Some cant even do that. We have a chance to win it. They have outplayed us, but even at our worse, (and believe me you've played your worst) they only have 17 on us. I've seen games we put 17 in 5 minutes. 17's a breeze. Show them that. Show them our best. Play so hard, that they tell stories of this game. About how they almost beat those Colts. But before they tell that story, we need to finish writing it. So lets give those fans something to watch! I want the hot dog stand empty! I want those seats only used for kids to stand on! I want to see the Winner inside all of you be labeled on the frontpage of every newspaper in this country! YOU ARE THE VERY BEST. Show the world. Get that football. Get those 17 points. Get more. Get the win. and Get me THAT LOMBARDI TROPHY!!! "<br>  <br>  Now if i was the Playboy Trolls coach-<br>  <br>  "Bevo, stop leaving your beer cans on the field. Ok? Do you know what a contract is worth for the Super Bowl winning QB? Do you know how much you can pawn off that SB ring? Thats enough to buy beer for a lifetim-well, actually for you prolly a years supply. But think of that. So get your head outta Nikky's *** and get that beer!!!"|`|YlBLz9lTaa	Id remind the players of all the hard work it took to get here and to the young guys think of all the vets who mentored you as you came into the league and how they might be retiring after this year and a SB ring would be the best way to thank them for what they have done to help you grow as a football player|`|RS3fjNboaa	LMAO @ Troller! I promise I won't leave beer cans on the field. I drink bottle beer. LOL!|`|39ixfEIraa	"come on you pussys!" we worked all year for this and you are gonna let them take your cookies? They are making you look like the teletubies out here! You guys are like McCaully Caulken and they are mike jackson! they are raping you!!!

fz0Aw3hLaa	Why are you relieved that Brad Johnson is gone?<br>  Who cares about the back-up?<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  LMFAO<br>  My rebuttal was going to be, "maybe you shouldn't have a QB who goes out for 3 games with pansy injuries."<br>  But you beat me to it, haha well played.<br>  Maybe they should pick up J.P. Lossman or Rex grossman.<br>  Both have showed that they can be good at times, but not consistent enough to be starter material.|`|MDhI4mBEaa	Last time I looked, Brad Johnson had a Super Bowl ring on his finger, which Romo will probably never have. Good luck finding a backup QB, as well as a starting QB that can win a playoff game!!!|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Brad Johnson has something Romo doesn't, a SB ring but if the Cowboys keep Romo, I don't see them winning a SB so I say let him play but as for a back-up QB, Jones may pick up Vick|`|9lIZnt1Haa	Johnson sucked!!! dang i even prayed to God to get rid of him asap. and tony romo screwed us over this season. partly thanx to jessica simpson. i'm a huge cowboys fan too.|`|Lg4BkwWOaa	They will probably just draft QB, maybe in the 5th or 6th round.<br>  I think Tom Brandstater (Fresno State) is a good choice. Hes got potential as an NFL qb|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Michael Vick...it would be wrong, but just so right at the same time.|`|CQcLHR0zaa	1st off- Romo is inconsistent but hes the best thing that has happened to the Cowboys in a long time and is probably an Elite Qb in the league<br>  <br>  2nd- Brad Johnson is a good, solid, veteran QB  with a SB ring who didnt do amazing BUT he didnt play on defense (when Romo was gone Detroit had a better defense) and like 78% of the offense doing poorly was not his fault. Not to mention he holds the record for the only QB in the league to catch his own TD pass.<br>  <br>  Cowboys are a crybaby soap opera of a team and you cant blame the few dependable (but not flashy or amazing) players for the team's failure<br>  <br>  but i wouldnt expect a cowboys fan to know that so i forgive you|`|PuxP6UzVaa	If most Vikings fan had their way they would trade Tavaris Jackson and a 3rd round draft pick  to the Cowboys for Brooks Bollinger and I,m glad we dont have  Bollinger.|`|nlIpKw8Paa	Jeff Garcia but he probley thinks he's still a starter and if he does think that he's wrong dallas should get him as a back up.
Yun8QBAIaa	The best thing for you to possibly do would be to get a punching bag.  They have light ones, heavy ones, free standing bags, etc.  Other than that you can get about 5-7 spare tires (get them cheap from a junkyard) and tie them together and hang them up.  My old Muay Thai gym used to do this all of the time.  But beware, they are hard and can hurt you if you don't start off easy. Plus wear gloves of course.|`|AA12116854	Well, the only thing I can suggest is, like Rocky, you go to a meat locker and punch out sides of beef.
hzttr76Maa	Offseason. How else could you get 3 big-time free agents opt out and sign with another team? Or Ray Allen and KG traded to the same team? I like the offseason better. More unpredictable.|`|P93I8CHtaa	deadline|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Yeah nothing happened this (Big Trades) this trade deadline whereas in the offseason bigger trades do occur therefore the offseason is better. For trades obviously because the offseason sucks.|`|zNO8flyCaa	i know cool there is a lot to come for a lot of teams who need those players there i mean a lot of good to come from nba and trading i love trades they are so cool sometimes like for boston|`|HNQU9V6Haa	the offseason especially when 2010 comes around|`|WLXFAeSnaa	The trade deadline.<br>  <br>  The offseason SUCKS!

Njom1Wbtaa	The Rockets played a terrific defense on Lebron, I was not surprised about that, I was surprised of how well they boxed Lebron out in rebounds. Limiting Lebron to 1 rebound and no assist at all. Probably, Lebron is having trouble, and will be having trouble of the top playoff contender in the West. <br>  <br>  Nope, Lebron 100% the MVP right now, with so many injuries, and rising teams on the East, they still have one of the best record in the NBA.

VHYIx8vcaa	I would still pick the west my friend|`|AA11643636	The East is top heavy with the top four totaling 164 wins to the West top four of 160 wins.  The West 5-8 seeds are better with 138 wins to the East 5-8 seeds with 113 wins, and Detroit is fading out of this picture very fast.<br>  <br>  The East's top four have faired very well against the West's top four.  The Lakers have beaten the Celtics both times but lost to Orlando both times, and Orlando also swept San Antonio, split with Denver, and lost to Houston.<br>  <br>  I think the West top 8 overall is better than the East.  However the East's top 4 has shown that they are better than the West's top 4.<br>  <br>  What does this mean...nothing.  Only the playoffs can prove which conference is better.  The Champ currently resides in the East.  Until that changes...the East is better.|`|83ebpB19aa	Alright, let's go through the whole standings.<br>  1. Lakers > Cleveland<br>  2. San Antonio < Boston<br>  3. Denver < Orlando<br>  4. Houston > Atlanta<br>  5. Portland > Miami<br>  6. New Orleans > Philadelphia<br>  7. Utah > Detroit<br>  8. Dallas > Milwaukee<br>  9.

dpSr0icwaa	It is designed to have a hollow point on the end so it expands better.  However, the hollowpoint design and the maximum acheived velocities are not really going to make it expand.  The hollowpoint feature is simply marketing hype.  Tjhis is true of ALL hollowpoints, regardless of what their source of velocity is.  The flesh just doesn't generate enough hydrostatic pressure to give good expansion at lower velicites.<br>  <br>  What I suspect is happening is that most hollowpoints are round nose, and at it's worst, unexpanding, this hollowpoint is going to be performing as a flat point.  flat points do create greater wound channels and delivers more shock over round noses.  One of the hinderances in flat points is that they start doing this righ away, whereas a hollowpoint will penetrate further first, and then surpass the flat point.  On small game greater penetraiton is not at all necessary.  I expect it is flatpoint performance that is being misunderstood as hollowpoint performance.<br>  <br>  However it is designed to also be a bit heavier than normal in overall weight, and to have most of that weight forward coupled with a longer 'tail' for greater flying stability.  Basically it is immitationg the features of a brenneke slug.<br>  <br>  This means in a higher velocity air rifle, it will fly more accurately and have more retained energy on target down range.  However, it will also drop a lot more inchs per yard as it flies.  This means if you miscalculate the range, you will be more off target than with a supposedly less accurate round.<br>  <br>  Finally none of these features will do any good if you aren't using it in an airgun that acheives at least 750 fps in  22 cal or 950 fps in 177 cal.  Slower guns this thing would be a real dog|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Akluis gave you a good answer. Basically, unless you're shooting an airgun pellet at high velocities (900 fps) airgun pellets you're not going to see much expansion (there will be some, but how much on game animals is debatable). However hollow-point and wadcutter pellets have a greater frontal surface area so they're more likely to transfer all their energy into smaller game animals and deform in the process leaving a bit wider wound channel (and causing the animal to bleed out a bit more quickly). That should translate into a quicker kill since the energy and pellet is more likely to stay in the animal and not drill through.<br>  <br>  If you want to know more about how hollow-point pellets work, check the Tom Gaylord article I linked to as a source.|`|VariKEFBaa	They have a hollow point and they expand, creating a bigger wound channel, thus causing more shock.

There is great potential for further improvement in your jumping skill. Not jumping in Vans is a good start!<br>  <br>  I would definitely join the team, especially if you enjoy competition, comraderie, and the event. I'm sure you'll be practiccing with the sprinters on building some fast twitch muscle strength, which will go a long way in terms of building up strength and speed. II'm sure your coach will have a training regimen for you, but before the season starts, get some running shoes and go out for some easy runs, jsut to get in shape. A little distance never hurt anyone, and then as you get close to the season ask your coach for some sprint workouts so that you can get an early start on training for the upcoming season. There are a ton of things you can do, but that would mosty likely be a good way to start off, and prepare yourself for the upcoming season.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

He was taken in by the best when he was in Evolution and he blossomed. His rivalry right now might not be a career changing one for him, but for Cody Rhodes and DeBiase to be involved in a feud involving Triple H & the McMahons is huge for their development. So Orton has his uses besides his wrestling talent .|`|IMu3wBu8aa	My best friend would!!! <br>  I would too. Randy's interesting.|`|86kZ5uYwaa	I would.

gSgYDAEAaa	I think the top three will be Bryant, Julio Jones, and A.J. Green from Georgia.|`|Evu9Eq06aa	I think it is Michael Crabtree. I had the same feeling about Larry Fitzgerald when he was coming out of college and now im having the same feeling about Crabtree. However, Dez Bryant is up there too.|`|X6ZxYovlaa	Julio runs out of gas too easily, and Bryant is good, but Crabtree has better NFL type skills like speed in tight spaces, route running, and strength.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	watch out for jordan shipley.|`|cT4Wl3n4aa	Man.........What about Jordan Shipley from Texas.

oqQjnpfGaa	KEEP: <br>  Jefferson and Garcia. They will help you more than hurt you. <br>  <br>  Brooks could be drop for Varajeo since you'll probably get double-double from him.  Brooks should eventually catch fire and get hot, but for now he is still learning the ropes of a Starting PG and sharing some good minutes with Kyle Lowry. <br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful.|`|58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	Varejeo is not that great of a PF even though he fills in nice when someone is injured, <br>  <br>  Is Mcdyess, C. Anderson, or maybe Noah available in your league. They are all better options that Varejeo. But if that's who you're aiming for, then I would drop Lowry. It's too late in the season for him to cut into Aaron Brooks minutes because Houston already announced that he is the starter for the remainder of the season, and Von Wafer has proven he can come off the bench and score in a hurry. Already noted that Nocioni will come off the bench for Garcia and if you drop Jefferson, you're giving up a ton of three's and a person who is able to score a ton when he gets hot.<br>  <br>  Drop Kyle Lowry he's your weak link

8iRi6hqSaa	Michelle McCool & Maryse defeated Eve Torres & Maria<br>  <br>  Once again, the bad girls of WWE win this opening tag team divas match on Smackdown. The girls really tried had to set up a good overall match. There were some great moments, and they are improving in the wrestling psychology stages, but overall there wasn’t a whole lot too this match up. The match was swift and once again the bad girls won, as was expected.<br>  <br>  Mvp defeated Chavo Guerrero & Shelton Benjamin<br>  <br>  MVP fought two guys in this match up after R Truth had to bow out of a tag team match up. The most interesting thing that happened during this match was Chavo turned on Shelton! That was great, Chavo refused to partner with Shelton after a while. Leaving Shelton to fight off Mvp alone, and by the time Shelton regained his composure after a huge Frog Splash from Chavo, MVP hit the drive by kick and lights out! MVP wins again!<br>  <br>  Umaga defeated Scotty Goldman<br>  <br>  Well, if you don’t already know, Goldman was fired earlier today. This match was his last televised match and he lost fast. Umaga beat the hell out of him and pinned him. The crowd was wowed by the timing of Umaga, that’s for sure; I agree it was impressive, but it is a far cry from seeing Umaga face a real opponent. <br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy defeated Edge via disqualification<br>  <br>  Jeff Hardy and Edge didn’t really disappoint. These two guys know how to put on a good show when in the main event. This match wasn’t half bad, lots of fast paced back and forth action. The end came with a disqualification thanks to Matt Hardy coming in and once again beating up Jeff Hardy, this time with a Twist of Fate! That’s right, another betrayal, and it’s all over. Bad news for Hardy because he probably won’t get another title shot until he manages to edge out Matt. <br>  <br>  WWE Smackdown 2/20/09 Results<br>  <br>  Michelle McCool & Maryse defeated Eve Torres & Maria<br>  Mvp defeated Chavo Guerrero & Shelton Benjamin<br>  Umaga defeated Scotty Goldman<br>  Jeff Hardy defeated Edge via disqualification<br>  <br>  Overall a terrible night in wrestling, there was a lot of story line and not that much wrestling. There were random moments with the Colons, lots of flash backs and random moments that really have nothing to do with wrestling as much as they have to do with story lines. It was like watching Raw this time, which can be good or bad depending on which way you look at it. We also learned that Undertaker will face Kozlov at Wrestlemania for the streak, which means it will be 17 and 0. That is unless JBL and HBK don't get involved. It was just a random night of wrestling, that's for sure.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	do you mean this coming Friday?<br>  <br>  Matt and Jeff Hardy are supposed to wrestle but Jeff refuses.

joA5Rcyzaa	if you are interested in doing tricks and such then you should go with a 20" because it's a small wheel, it's light, and easier to control, also it depends on how tall you are.<br>  <br>  if you just want to ride and go faster then you should go with a 24" and above<br>  <br>  i wouldn't start at anything bigger then a 24" because after that it's harder for beginners to learn to ride|`|DOVbF4Piaa	To start off get a 20 or 24 inch.|`|DPjPYzCyaa	I personally like the twenty inch because its lighter and you have more control it is also great for learning on.  If you want to go long distances and use it to go places you should get a bigger wheel like the 24 or 26.<br>  if you are above 5.5 you could use a 24 but i recommend the 20

C8DOT8Y7aa	Make a commitment to train for three days a week. Alternate between longer and shorter runs. also do not forget to stretch and always drink water before and after your work out to prevent cramping. <br>  ALWAYS warm up before you stretch. If you don't warm up first stretching will be ineffective. Proper stretching is key to avoiding injury. <br>  After a minimum of one month of base work, averaging three hours per week running, start following this weekly schedule or finish it without rest days: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Day 1 - Tempo run. Warm up 10 minutes. Run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), cool down 10 minutes. <br>  Day 2 - Rest day <br>  Day 3 - Easy 30 minute run <br>  Day 4 - 40/20s. Warm up 10 minutes, 12 cycles of Sprint 40 seconds, jog 20 seconds. Cool down 10 minutes. <br>  Day 5 - Rest day <br>  Day 6 - Long run. Start slowly and run conversational pace for 40-90 minutes. It is helpful to have a running buddy or friend/spouse/kid willing to toodle along on a bike. <br>  Day 7 - Rest day. <br>  Try challenging yourself once every two weeks or so with this technique: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a local track (1/4 mile) or flat surface (1/4 mile) to run on. <br>  Stretch and do a light warm up (e.g. 25 jumping jacks or a light jog). <br>  Do a 1/4 mile sprint followed by a 1/4 mile jog. Do the sprint & jog routine for at least 2 miles. <br>  if you do a 5k for instance, make sure you have a lot of speedwork, then long distance. you can increase your speedwork-outs by taking off time not distance, do not just start doing hard workouts, make sure you have about 1-2 months of running before you start speedwork. for the first month or so, do about 1-4 easy; walk it if you want. <br>  <br>  Beat your own time. Once you have your initial time, you do not want to go below it. At least maintain an average time. <br>  <br>  pace your self, if your doing a 5k workout you can pace your self according to your mile pace. <br>  Do a cool down. After every run, you do not want to just stop running. Walk the run off till your heart rate is moderate. Then stretch. Stretching is very important after running. If you don't stretch, you will start getting pains in your feet for the next few days and it will be a bit difficult to walk. Some good stretches are flamingos, and touching your feet while standing up. Also to alter this stretch, grab your toes and try to straighten out your knees. It really stretches your hamstrings. <br>  Increasing your upper body strength by lifting weights is a good way to build speed to run faster. The lower back and shoulder are also important. Exercises like pull ups, sit ups, and push ups to improve core strength are important to good running. Do not do heavy exercises like squats, leg presses, leg extensions, leg curls, and calf raises, lunges every day, as they tend to overwork your legs. The added leg strength is not worth being injured frequently. Instead, do 2-3 one minute reps of wall-sits two times a week along with lunges with light weights or a medicine ball. <br>  Make a commitment. Do not quit your regimen, do not tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow, do not tell yourself you're too tired, and do not tell yourself you're too busy. Run in the morning to get it over with. <br>  <br>  but remember just have fun, running is fun!!!! <br>  Thirty years of competitive distance running and research on exercise physiology boil down to a few essentials. The key is to start slowly and work your way up gradually.
dKbWKaAjaa	do u rele even need to ask tht the proof is in the fight and mohammmad is much better in every respect he is just way more rounded than tyson and thats why he wons|`|NOhpGTrZaa	its not easy to say because both fighters are from different times.. Mohammed Ali bought the showman to the ring.. trash talking and generally messing with the opponents head. and is very quick.. however Tyson still holds the record of quick knockouts in first round.. very hard to say but i think Tyson would destroy Ali|`|lJZtQX07aa	This question is always so funny to me. Prime Tyson of 1988 could be touched by no one. No one, my friend. He was the best. You could not lay one punch on him. He was too fast and his head movement was too good for anyone. His unique combinations were seen by no one before his time. The only skill Ali had was running away while punching at you with his long arms to keep you away. I think even Ali himself said he was scared of a prime Tyson, but I don't recall where I read it or if it's legitimate.
GRfnMIQTaa	The fastest goal you can usually et off a faceoff at center ice is about 6 seconds. 2 goals could come quickly so having that extra man could help. If you're already down by two, margin of defeat doesnt matter in the NHL so losing by three is a risk thats worth getting a point or two|`|t14Jk1IPaa	Because its worth a try to get the win, if you lose you get no points and even if you get 1 point it could make a difference at the end of the season. Pulling the goalie gives them an extra player which gives them a man advantage and a chance to get a goal or two. Its good to see coaches do this, shows that they want to win. Looks worse for ppl just looking up the score if your team lost by 3 but if your actually watching the game it makes sense.|`|f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	that goalie is replaced by an extra forward.... an extra man that the defense cannot cover. more scoring potential. some games have been won by a team 3 goals down in the last 1 minute by a pulled goalie.|`|AA12089021	Because a loss is a loss.  It doesn't matter whether you lose by two or three.|`|DCNL73ZJaa	because then they can add in another skater and try to get more goals|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	I think any coach would provided the trailing team was applying some offensive pressure towards the end.  If the leading team wasn't allowing the trailing team to get it into/stay in the offensive zone they probably wouldn't out of fear of being embarassed.|`|ROWSzTknaa	Two quick goals to tie it up, you never know. You don't need that much time if you get a shot right of the face-off. Anything can happen.|`|0GzSqXZUaa	because theres nothing to lose.|`|zMSdChKgaa	They have no choice, it's all or nothing. After all, what have they got to lose?|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Last ditch effort.
FraPsQV6aa	first of all little boyy, I am a cross country runner of three years going into my fourth and all I have to say is right on.  xc is a man's sport, you'll understand when you start running<br>  <br>  if you really want to practice then go out for a two mile jog or something, not on a track though like on the sidewalk or in terrain just don't get lost <3 but if you're running xc its inevitable just get lost with a buddy<br>  <br>  so yeah start running like two miles and then gradually increase it ya digg|`|ecbkzmrIaa	Go to York university, and check the schedule.  I have raced there a few times, they do have an indoor track.  When training for xc, you really should get outside though, as the track can't prepare your legs for the pounding.
obPSaYf3aa	I would definitely consult with your local pro shop to ask questions and get fitted for a bowling ball, which is much better than using a house ball because the span and finger holes don't exactly match your hand.<br>  <br>  When starting out, usually you'll just be learning the basics, so these "entry level" reactive urethane/resin coverstock bowling balls should do the trick, because they are lower priced, but able to hook on all lane conditions when polished or sanded:<br>  <br>  Brunswick Avalanche Slide<br>  Brunswick Power Groove<br>  Hammer Vibe<br>  Hammer Razyr<br>  Ebonite Tornado<br>  Columbia 300 Scout-R<br>  Storm Tropical Storm<br>  <br>  After you get better in the game and learn all the basics, you can then purchase a plastic/polyester spare ball and upgrade to a high performance bowling ball and use your entry level ball for drier lane conditions.  That way you'll have an "arsenal" with which to tackle any lane condition when practicing or bowling.  Good luck!|`|2MGJAwM9aa	Since you are a beginner , you can get a inferno or something from brunswick . These are the balls that can hook . When choosing the ball , you should get something 10% of your body weight . For more info , you can go to www.brunswickbowling.com to browse through the balls and other accessories .
CshFQShGaa	Someone will eventually break it, but probably not anyone who's playing yet. It will stand for awhile. Look at how long Babe Ruth's 60 held up- 34 years (1927 to 1961), then Maris' held up for 37 years. That tells me that the record is safe for awhile, even though Bonds broke a 3 year old record.|`|sBeZWl35aa	Im sure someone will, but not anytime soon, Ryan Howard could do it if he didn't strike out so much.|`|5XV1ZFyqaa	I would have to say yes.

Esp with this roid scandal being put to an end.|`|jKdVtDx7aa	I say yes. There will always be something out there that helps a player "enhance " his abilities. Something that will make them stronger like steroids but not yet discovered. It will happen. Its just a matter of time. You are talking about guys that want to do well against the best players in the world and they will do or try anything to get an edge. Not all will try things that are illegal or do some kind of damage to your body but some will. They have before and will again.|`|3QELIOU7aa	Yes another steroid user will come along and smash it.
6m4ANEZGaa	Mate, watch Cameron's last fight. He gets hit easily and hasn't faced anyone remotely close to what Tua has faced.<br>  People forget Tua has knocked out and beaten, Ruiz, Moorer, and The Rock, all of them have held world title belts.<br>  He has also been 12 with Lennox Lewis who hit him with everything and couldn't stop him, not to mention guys like Chris Byrd in his prime. Fact is Tua has never been put down and has fought some very good fighters. His left hook was voted the most devastating in the division by his fellow boxers! Sure this is a while ago but the last thing to leave a fighter is his power and Cameron will not be able to hide from that left hook for 10 rounds!!!<br>  If an in shape Tua hits the ring in Hamilton between 105kg and 110kg the fight will only go 5 rounds at best.<br>  Don't get me wrong Cameron is a good heavyweight and a top bloke but is way out of his league here. In saying this what a great event for boxing in NZ and the general public that has limited knowledge on boxing will lap this hype up!!!!|`|kqP7GwOcaa	If Tua lands solid, it's lights out for Cameron.|`|zI6cZoAWaa	biggest fight in new zealand history. i remember shane cameron was defeated by that journeyman nigerian fighter (cant remember his name) but david tua never lose to somone like that. i will predict david tua kayo

One thing to prevent muscle soreness from happening is to always stretch thoroughly before a practice or game.  However, I know it doesn't always prevent it.  <br>  <br>  Soreness, is lactic acid that's built up in and around your muscles.  Proffesional athletes get it a lot, that's why after games they have an hour long massage to help.  If you can get a massage by someone that would help, but otherwise just stretch your muscles or try and rest/relax.|`|U3mlAxWSaa	sit with your legs outstretched and relaxed. Take your elbow and massage your quads deeply. Do one at a time. Really dig the elbow into it. It will hurt. Then take your knuckles and lightly massage the top of your thigh. Do this till it is red. That means there is blood-flow to the area and the muscle is loose. Then stretch each one thoroughly. Continue this process every 30 min or so for the next few days. IT will be sore tomorrow, but less. Only massage with the elbow the first time. That is deep tissue and it will damage the muscle if you do it multiple times. <br>  This process will not only make you feel better but it will release alot of tension in the muscle for a long time. Also make sure you stretch the muscle after each workout.|`|mAtUgT8naa	grow some balls|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	If you want to get big and strong for the season, you have to put up with this pain.<br>  <br>  Take a rolling pin over your quads.  Gently at first, but then really push it in.  Try to pull it toward you instead of pushing it away.  That will help break out that lactic acid and get those fibers to start healing.  Ice and ibuprofen help as well.
b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Well the first thing you need to do is to recognise that it is okay to feel nervous before racing and many riders do even the top ones.  The thing you need to do is turn your nerves into something you can use.  If you have a mate or friend who can walk you to the line (preferably one who love to talk a bit of sh*t) then recruite them as that does work well and keeps you distracted from those last second jitters.  <br>  <br>  Set yourself up a pre race routine and stick to it.  Make sure you have got yourself prepared even with just the little things so you can say to yourself that you are prepared.  <br>  <br>  When you are on the bike and ready to go, keep telling yourself that you have put in the work and are prepared.  Those other guys are not prepare and have not done the work.  You have.  Keep repeating it.  Focus completely on that first corner and see yourself going around it first.  <br>  <br>  You just have to get it into your head that you are prepared and have done everything to be so.  <br>  <br>  Nerves are okay.  Just use them.|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	dont listen to DJ...<br>  how many years have you been racing?<br>  when i was younger and first started to race i felt the same way it is very nerve racking.<br>  now i have been racing 6 years... <br>  you just have to have confidence tell your self you are going to win. have no fear. dont pay attention to anyone but yourself... what i do before all my races is crank my ipod and just listen to some awesome tunes helps you forget about every1 and everything. when it is race time focus on your goal. when the gates go down dont be afraid! hop on all the throttle you can get. pinn your bike runn it wide open in the start so you can get the hole shot and be in first right away... once you are ahead dont slow down... but keep your kool while racing dont look back at the other guys that will just beak your focus. good luck racing bro hope this info helps you out.|`|CoHl61Hjaa	Your supposed to - <br>  <br>  The day you loose your nerve - is the day<br>  you loose interest !!<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as nerves - it's adrenaline !!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Only when you're a Honda Factory Rider - <br>  Will you loose the nerves !!|`|ZQCBqYTbaa	Good advice from Auburn as usual. <br>  I always liked the phrase <br>  Feel the fear and do it anyway|`|UddiGNiXaa	i normally try to get a really good night sleep and a good breakfast in the morning. That gets you going, than when your waiting for your race, sit in a comfy chair and listen to music. just to calm you down, and you want to basically run the race through your head. From start to finish, think about passing lines, and where the fastest normal lines are. Also watch as many starts as you can, and try to see what gate is constantly getting the hole shot, or at least somewhere near. And check your bike over completely, make sure everything is tight, and there is plenty of gas and oil. and no broken parts. this calms you down and you have alot less to worry about.  and once you get on the line and try to get there as soon as possible, redo the start in your head a few times. and look for a few lines that you would take. and getting nervous is a part of everyones motocross career. and you will get out of it eventually.|`|MkFJ0HqEaa	sing.  honestly, everyone gets butterflies at the starting gate.  whenever i get nervous i usually stare at the first turn and start singing the last song that i heard that really pumped me up.  everything else is gets pushed out of my mind. the other racers, the fans, everything. just me and getting to the first turn.  try it!|`|WlSelrj5aa	You have to have confidence in your own ability,somehow convince yourself you CAN do it by keep repeating it in your head;you re here,so you must be good enough to compete with these guys.|`|0eA4gkHdaa	i get the same feelings<br>  <br>  is it like when your knees start to shake and you are afraid to look dumb?<br>  <br>  i just try to remember that everything will be better as long as you try your hardest|`|njuCUxrCaa	ya i get the same feeling just dont worry everybody gets them because u are hopping you dont pile in the first corner. in the summer i dont get them because im half dead from the heat its like 600 degrees on the line jk lol|`|dGZ4qyfaaa	I drink a lot of whisky|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Great advice Auburn, your a kicka$$ race mom. Dude, I've been racing over 20 years and I still feel that way. You just have to learn to use that nervous energy to your advantage rather than letting it break your concentration. I have always been a very good starter and I've always felt my nervous energy played a roll in that. It's all good man, just know that once that gate drops the nerves are gone. That's what I keep telling myself.

Cl6KbcAGaa	This bike should have came with a lefty fork originally and the bike originally sold US for about $2600. Depending on what the fork is on this bike right now would greatly determine your offer of $700+/- that you wish to offer. If it is a Fox fork no earlier than 06' on the bike then your offer is fine if it is less than that then you may reconsider? I would also accept a Rock Shox fork of a higher grade or even a Marzochii fork too. If all the other specs on the bike are original then consider the deal as "good" . Forks are easily replaceable and I have never been a fan of the lefty fork anyway and would not likely ever buy a Cdale anyway, albeit a great bike.

HcSQPUYWaa	Yeah I had something similar happen to me during a pickup game.  My friend had come back from the store with some sodas and I had a Coke.

The diamondbacks in my opinion aren't comparable to the treks, but i build treks for a living so i am biased. As far as the differences between the fuels you are getting a lot for the price difference. The 5.5 lacks the technology trek is known for. The 7 has the evo link, which will add stiffness and reduce the weight. Which is what every rider tries to achieve. The ABP or active breaking pivot. That gives you a better ride and more control. It acts much like the ABS on a car. The 7 also has a tapered headset, it goes from 1.5 in to 1 1/8 in. This again adds stiffness and reduces weight. I think if you can afford the price difference you should take it, you will become a better rider with a better bike because you are able to do more with it.|`|HgBvRwjraa	Get the trek 7.

AA10702710	I have seen it done.  But a few words of caution here.<br>  <br>  First, after you run it through a .270 neck sizer die, you will need to trim the case down with a case trimmer (I like Lyman for this).  When resizing cases like this, the brass at the neck tends to get longer, so you must trim it to SAAMI specs.<br>  <br>  Second, be careful that you are the only one that uses said reloaded ammo and that you are conscious that the cartridges are now .270 Winchester.  To the naked eye, a 30-06 headstamped cartridge will look like a 30-06...even though it's been necked-down to .270.  I know a man that actually shot some .270 Winchesters out of his 30-06 rifle.  He wondered why he missed the deer at such a short distance.  It turns-out that he picked-up the wrong box of ammo before leaving his house that morning.  And the ammo was correctly headstamped, .270 Winchester.  He just wasn't paying attention.  He didn't damage his gun (luckily) but he did tell me that is made a tremendous bang when it fired it in the oversized bore.|`|AA11694178	Yes.  The .270 is based on the .30-06 cartridge.  You will need to get a set of .270 dies, of course, and run your .30-06 brass through the resizing die to make it into .270 brass.  This process of necking down brass requires careful and proper lubrication of the brass.  Too little lubrication and the brass can stick in the die.  Too much and the shoulders of the case can become dented.  If you have a properly lubricated brass case, you will still need to use finesse to resize it.  Do not just use brute force to get it to go into the resizing die or it can be damaged or become stuck.  I resize brass such as this by starting it into the die until I meet good resistance and then back it out.  I restart it into the die again until I meet significant resistance and stop.  About three of four such partial strokes will finally allow you to go full stroke.  At this point, you will have created a .270 case from a .30-06 case.  However, the resizing process may have stretched the brass.  You now need to trim it to proper length.  Your final step is to load the lightest load recommended in your reloading manual and using the cheapest bullets you can find. Fire the loaded round in your rifle.  This last step will fireform the brass to the exact dimensions of your rifle chamber and you will have custom ammo for your specific gun.  After this, you may load your brass to your preferred load.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	It's possible, Cutie, but why go to all of the expense and effort to re-invent the wheel?  Just buy some .270 Win brass and load that!  Anybody sells the brass for this excellent, versatile cartridge.|`|ca6144d7933bfd99d11441a498f7e603aa	The shoulder .270 is .050 farther forward on the case  than .30-06. They are made that way so if you load one in a .30-06 chamber you cannot close the bolt.<br>  If you have some good hard brass, the case would probably be turned inward when run through the re-sizer. Assuming then you could re-size down to .270, the extra brass in the case neck would have to be reamed out so the bullet would fit. Now you have the .050 extra shoulder to contend with because the round headspaces on the shoulder. You can fireform the brass to fit. Looks like a lot of trouble to me.<br>  It is easier to make .30-06 from a .270, because all the work is done with one pull of the press.|`|AA12243350	.270 is nothing more than a 30-06 case necked down to the smaller diameter of the .270. So in a quick answer...Yes certainly, you just have to resize it and trim to the correct OAL.<br>  shoot safe|`|CFQbdDRNaa	If this is the case...then can you use a 270 in an ot-6 and fire form the case to fire 30-06?|`|dpSr0icwaa	yes, but you must run it through a re-sizer to get the appropriate neck size.|`|VariKEFBaa	You could, but:<br>  <br>  1: You have to size it down to accept .277 bullets<br>  2..270 brass is just a little bit longer than factor 30-06 brass<br>  <br>  -that being said, this will only work for .270 winchester, not .270 wsm or weatherby mag or such.  <br>  <br>  -its probably just better to buy some unprimed .270 brass and go from there.|`|AA11642353	Yes-- it can be done---BUT---make for sure you resize & trim properly and most important---be for sure you are the only person that uses this ammo and if someone else uses it make for sure they know that it is  270 ammo and not 30-06 ammo....

FLBuzlCuaa	I would not bother with a shoulder holster for a a p22. The holster will be WAY too bulky for a gun that small.. and then you will always have to wear a jacket or some fugly button up over it. Get an Uncle Mikes in the pants holster. I usually carry full size 4.5 to 5 inch guns.. Im 140 pounds very slim guy and can wear 30x30 tight fitting jeans and a size small t shirt and it doesn't print. The Uncle Mikes would probably print less than a cell phone with a p22 and a tight fit T. You can wear it in the front, back, or side. I like mine on the right just behind my hip. I also carry a walther p22 when I jog in the woods. I would not suggest it as a self defense gun though.. no stopping power, but plenty of killing power lol. I used mine to take out a 140 pound dog with rabies last summer.

PMluTf72aa	Jeremy Thompson was a work out freak in last years draft and is our project player.  He will be Kampmann's backup as the hybrid OLB.  Clay Mathews is our new OLB to compliment Kampmann.  He is fast and has experience playing as a DE in college.  Green Bay simply has no need for Jason Taylor anymore, unless injuries occur this season again.  Taylor is too undersized to play DE in the 3-4 scheme, he would only be a backup, and I doubt he would accept that role.|`|Ro4Q9bIUaa	Have you not been watching then?<br>  <br>  They're converting Kampman to OLB, with Hawk, Poppinga and Barnett filling out the 4. Up front, Jenkins and Pickett will most likely fill out two of the positions. I see a position battle between Raji and Harrell. And Clay Matthews figures to be in the mix as well, not forgetting Thompson and Montgomery.<br>  <br>  All in all, good strength in depth on the defense who will hopefully benefit from better coaching from Dom Capers and his staff.<br>  <br>  Players have been brought in specifically to play the 3-4, and I believe that the players already on the staff are coachable. Why in the world would you bring in someone who, whilst admittedly very good, hasn't got long left?<br>  <br>  Even after all of that, if Thompson decided to go after a high profile free agent, Peppers would be a much better fit. But that, along with your Taylor scenario, has no chance of happening.<br>  <br>  You need to understand that the Pack under TT will always take a pragmatic approach to building a team.|`|XOAsk1c4aa	because the packers are not the redskins they build teams the right way....jason taylor would be way over paid for his production at this point of his career, plus he'd rather do the rumba than sack a qb...i dont want him anywhere near my team|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Money !!The Packers are not going sign Jason Taylor for the money he wants!|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Because he's old, arrogant, and not focused on the game or improving himself.

qWXb4DIGaa	Don't push yourself too hard by starting in sport that's very challenging given your restraints.  Ask your dr. what would be a suitable amount of activity for your particular situation and then choose accordingly. You may not be running the 100 or jumping hurdles, but your dr. may find that throwing the shot put would work well for you. The good thing about track and field is that there are so many activities to choose from.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	I'm not trying to sound rude. But I would seriously consider consulting a doctor before you tried partaking in organized sports. You may want to consider dropping some weight before you start. Try running around your neighborhood first to build up some stamina. You're probably going to have to change your eating habits as well. At 5'5" your BMI is 39.9. Obese is 30 or better. It's commendable that you want to better yourself. But you have to smart about it and not jump right without some forethought. Good luck.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	It may be something that you can do.

You wouldn't"t even feel the sweat coming off you, but if you are self conscience about your body then I would try to go out for track.

AA10232540	That part that sticks into the little slot in the connector?  It has no name by itself....it's simply a tab added onto the trigger itself that lifts the connector straight upward when the trigger is pulled.  The safety on the inside of the receiver top has a matching piece that extends downward.  If the safety button is set to safe, the safety piece hits that connector and blocks it from moving upward thus stopping the trigger from being pulled.<br>  <br>  The most common breakage on that is when the gun is on safe and someone who doesn't know guns thinks that means "pull the trigger harder".  It can snap that little tab off.<br>  <br>  The stock *has* to be replaced with the right amount of washers or the bolt will extend into the receiver far enough to block the safety....and then when you pull the trigger *hard*, it snaps that part.<br>  <br>  Brownell's is one of the most expensive parts dealers there are.  DON'T buy from them if you can avoid it!  Numrich has the same part....the trigger....at half that price.  <a href="http://gunbroker.com" rel="nofollow">http://gunbroker.com</a> often has the trigger for $5.<br>  <br>  Word of warning....when you try to change that trigger in the trigger assembly, it can be a real b*tch!

Something about people renting guns to shoot themselves (suicide).

P93I8CHtaa	i rather have the big romo|`|4kdlE54Paa	So you must be one of those fans that do not think football is a team sport.  Romo did not lose the games.  The team did.  you have to look at all aspects of the team to understand their weeknesses.  In 2008, the cowboys weekness was team chemistru and a poor performing defence.  Tony Romo is twice the QB Vince Young only wishes he could be, but Young does have the potential if he can prove he doesn't have a soft mind.  A leader can not pull the BS he has done since he became a pro and especially in the beginning of the 2008 season.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Vince Young has 0 playoff wins. I really don't know what you're talking about.<br>  <br>  He's 0-1 with a loss to the Chargers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Romo has many more TDs than INTs, and is efficient in the regular season. I think it might just be the Cowboys overall that are chokers. How many wins in the playoffs did they have the 10 years before he started? Exactly|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Romo. By far.<br>  <br>  Tony Romo has gone 27-12 as a starter. I know, he chokes in the playoffs, but it's not like he's been around ten years. He's only played in TWO playoff games; and both times the Cowboys very easily could have won.<br>  <br>  In 1991, Troy Aikman lost to the Lions 38-6 in his first playoff game (Dallas beat the Bears the previous week with backup Steve Beurlein starting).<br>  <br>  And for five or six years people said Peyton Manning could never win a big game.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	LMAO @ Vince Young...he's won how many playoff games?<br>  <br>  At least Romo is consistent...and not insane...<br>  <br>  wow, did I actually pick Romo over someone????|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Romo.<br>  <br>  He is not insane.|`|82Vo9DXCaa	I'll stick with Romo.

4YcZv0d7aa	I can see John Cena attempting a heel turn, but it's very unsuccessful. However, when Batista comes back, he will be a heel and go straight for the championship.

YPQTXOQ5aa	From what I understand the IRL is doing okay as far as sponsorship. Dollar General doubled their commitment to Sarah Fisher and I think that IRL will be good.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Tony George has admitted that the IRL has NOT made any money, and if it doesn't by 2013, he will shut it down.<br>  <br>  Adding a 3rd tier cable channel in Vs is making it almost IMPOSSIBLE for any team to sell sponsorship.  The cars suck, they sound like crap, smell like burning cornflakes, and they rely upon ride buyers.<br>  <br>  The IRL has taken some of the greatest racing tracks and wiped them off of the map.  I think that Milwaukee will be next to close its doors.<br>  <br>  As far as surving the split - Tony George CAUSED the split.<br>  <br>  For the sake of the drivers that haven't broken their back yet - I hope that the IRL closes up shop and the Atlantics series gets better TV time slots - as that is waaaay better racing.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	It survived the split, CART didn't, so I say at this time I say IRL will survive, its not going anywhere this yr or the next. Its here, once the economy picks back up for all forms of racing, IRL will survive.<br>  <br>  Go Team Penske|`|aizHCizlaa	I think it will be possible if they simply "allow" Danica to win a couple of races. This will gather a ton of publicity as she is a major drawing card for the sport. I know everyone will consider this to be a bullsh*t answer but it is the truth. IRL lacks only one thing: audience share. Danica would draw people like moths to a flame, if she simply won. This would be the shot in the arm that the IRL and open wheel racing needs.|`|Pe15GxjSaa	Hopefully, but it was really a stupid move to put the races on a TV channel that is by premium subscription only.

But ranking him so high is debatable. Brazil has never been known to produce great goalkeepers anyway. Dida is probably the best of the lot. <br>  Cesar at 35th is probably about right. To be a great keeper, the performance has to be consistent. It's not about just a few games. Cesar just had a good day at the office. <br>  Great goalkeepers are recognised easily. They will be in the limelight. Like Van Der Sar, Buffon, Casillias, Reina, Czech and even Toldo.

IITnJjAjaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Weights, treadmill, crunches, squats, exercise bands to strengthen arms and legs, resistance training, press-ups and lunges will all improve & help build up your speed<br>  <br>  Exercise bikes will be beneficial and maybe aqua jogging in the pool? Remember to slowly build up the amount you do, or your body won't react kindly to it.<br>  <br>  Other training methods for speed training are:<br>  <br>  *Downhill sprint training because the pull of gravity will force you to run faster than you would be able to prevent falling. It is important to concentrate on good form and drive while running downhill.<br>  <br>  *Hill running, same idea, run down the hill turn around and power sprint up it as hard and fast as possible. <br>  <br>  *10 × 30 metres sprint reps (on a track would help) <br>  <br>  Good luck i hope you get faster and faster for your rugby, i like rugby tis good (: One thing to remember!: Buy decent running shoes to train in.

They can still be moved around their own league through trades, but cannot be traded to an MLB team.<br>  <br>  Usually, players that never were successful for a MLB team will try and get noticed in the Independent Leagues.

AA10241450	If you have a heart condition I would wear a heart monitor and make sure your in your running zone.  Most runners by the way will have heart murmurs and will have strange heart rhythms in part because they have a stronger heart.  <br>  <br>  Relax your running when your heart rate nears your maximum.  Running is really learning to stress your body along with rest. Intervals will make you stonger and faster just make sure your resting heart rate reaches 120 heart beats per minute before running another interval.  Monitor your progress and keep track of your times in a journal. Good luck!|`|7PqwM6QXaa	5:26?!?!?<br>  THATS REALLY GOOD!<br>  jeez, our guys run that fast<br>  ALL our girls are in the 6-7 mins. range danggg lol<br>  drink tons of water (i know what u feel like, i have athletes asthma), and just keep practicing.<br>  My body has gotten used to our practices so i do notice myself getting better|`|8ebGghbbaa	Running the mile is all about pace.

XaFYUMRSaa	Guess because its worth more.|`|AA12103453	Part of it is also that the Steelers have been owned by the family for close to 75 years(there was a short time they didn't own it) so the value is a little harder to determine. With the Browns they are a recent expansion, which makes it a little easier to get a base price. I do agree with the first person though that the price isn't about history. You almost wonder though with the Steelers having a recent Superbowl victory and playoff success why they couldn't have managed to get their value above the Browns.|`|ghUm8M3laa	Being and intrepid and enterprising sort and not wanting to rely on the Yahoo Answers community to spoon feed me information I took the time to check www.forbes.com.  I didn't dig deep or look very hard to find team valuations from 2006.  This is the explanation provided to explain how teams were rated:<br>  Revenues and operating income are for 2005 season. Value of team based on current stadium deal (unless new stadium is pending) without deduction for debt (other than stadium debt). Debt/Value includes stadium debt. Revenue is net of stadium revenues used for debt payments. Operating Income is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization<br>  <br>  If there are rankings more recent than 2006 I didn't see them but I also didn't look very hard.  If the Steelers are still less valuable than the Browns then it is probably for all of the same reasons that existed in 2006.  <br>  <br>  |`|VTN4Qun9aa	The values don't necessarily reflect the teams' histories and win-loss records; they reflect the value of the team brand, which has little to do with the quality of the team on the field.|`|j8i9IOiJaa	Forbes did not overlooked the history .Like that one person said!!<br>  <br>  Their Forbes they don't overlook anything.|`|4KTe107Yaa	cause Pittsburgh is a dead town<br>  Unemployment is huge there|`|f313b2d192044982b64e96272b02fc55aa	You're pretty much splitting hairs here.

S1MhSluDaa	None. Or, Equal. <br>  <br>  The Lions got a good QB and a beast TE. But the team has no run game and no pass protection. So the QB will be sacked all day and the TE will  never get the ball thrown to him.<br>  <br>  The Niners have no good QB, so even with a good run game, they got no Qb with an arm or O-line to protect him meaning Crabtree will rarely get thrown to.<br>  <br>  Browns have no for sure starter at QB and lost Winslow and Braylon has attitude problems... They got a good line, but the QB thing needs to get fixed, and the WRs need time to get better, the ones they drafted aint no Crabtree.<br>  <br>  The Jets picked up a great QB and good RB. but the team has no WRs. so. defenses will put 8 in the box and eat up the run game, and sanchez has no viable threats to throw at.|`|4sCxzzFWaa	I think the Jets win this one.

4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Although i respect both superstars for destroying their bodies for the sake of entertainment for the fans i respect John Cena more than Jeff Hardy. John Cena first always gives it all in all his matches he never looks like he's going to slow down or just get lazy and give up on a match. Cena has also taken huge bumps such as a piledriver on the steel steps at wrestlemania 23 and others like his I quit match with JBL in 2005 and most recently getting choke slammed through the spotlight by the Big Show. The point is Cena does anything to help the wwe and has the passion and intensity every time he comes out. Also another big factor that i respect John Cena is because he also always donates and helps charity. He always helps out people in real life and is always willing to connect with his fans. The fact that John Cena has never burnt out and is never tired of wrestling or the wwe is something that i really respect. Another thing is that he knows how to take criticism he always gets crap from the people everywhere but he still deals with it. John Cena is someone i truly respect in this business.|`|86kZ5uYwaa	John Cena.|`|dgXKvb7haa	I REALLY hate Jeff Hardy and John Cena isn't that bad so I respect Cena.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	john cena only because he doesnt do drugs (that i know of) and doesnt "lose his passion".|`|XcZgG9y6aa	Cena because he is a real businessman, he will do anything wwe asks him and he's got better work ethics.

Jeff is a nice person, and yes, everyone makes mistakes in their lifetime, but I respect John Cena more than Hardy.|`|fvMv1DT3aa	I don't like either of them but I respect Cena more. You can see how much of a passion John Cena has for the wrestling business and you can tell how much he respects and appreciates his fans and he tries to do anything to please them.

AA11162346	I would carry my favorite handgun and the one I have the most confidence in. I would only carry the weapon that I would bet my life on,not what is easy or the most concealable.<br>  My answer is to buy the best possible conceal and carry holster for your weapon that will make it both comfortable and concealable in the same package,no matter what the weapon.<br>  It is without a doubt Galco leather. They have all of the bases covered .<br>  Use the weapon of your choice and Galco will conceal it for you.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I've heard good things about the Kel-Tecs, and they're certainly blessed with a favorable price compared to the more prestigious makes.  Be sure to practice with it as much as possible.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	I had a Kel Tec. I did not like it. It just felt to cheap and flimsy to me. It is a nice price for what you get. Not really a gun you would take to the range a shoot a bunch. If you do get it though, you do need to practice with it. I personally carry a CZ P-01. It is the most comfortable carry gun I have had and it is amazingly reliable and accurate. You may also want to check out the Glock 26. Really small, accurate, comfortable, and more importantly reliable.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	What works for one person might not work for another. It's like recommending a shoe size. You will want to either go to a range that rents guns and give several a try or go to a gun shop and hold as many as you can to get a feel for them. Please disregard anybody who says "this gun is the best".<br>  <br>  As for the caliber you want, there are several choices. For self defense I would recommend anything from 9mm to a .45. Any smaller is inadvisable and larger will be quite costly, heavy, and unnecessary. <br>  <br>  Try and keep an open mind about what you get. Just because you were originally planning on a glock/ruger/etc doesn't mean that that type of gun will appeal to you most.<br>  <br>  For the best pricing shop around and see what's available once you have a bit more specific idea of what you want. Check the internet and call around. Keep in mind that is you buy off of the internet you will have to pay for an FFL transfer and shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, please practice with your gun. If you can't hit anything with it, it's pretty useless.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Don't fail to check out the Taurus MILLENNIUM PRO? 145 .45 ACP.  It's pretty comparable to the Glock in size and weight and some people find it fits their hand better than the Glock or the Kahr.

Make sure to experiment as much as you can, look at all of your options, and don't make a decision based only on these comments or without checking out your options in person|`|4KvLIa6Saa	I carry a Kimber Ultra Raptor 2  45 acp 3" barrel if your going to carry for your defense don't go cheap as your life may depend on it> Kel Tec are cheap in price and look good in the adds but light in construction>|`|8IDNYBphaa	SMALL  .38 REVOLVER,

What are you attempting to accomplish exactly, by stating your opinions and beliefs as facts? Attention whoring?<br>  <br>  Stunts in most movies/shows are much more safely choreographed and they have multiple tries at it, while they only get one chance in wrestling and the hazards are much higher.

6n9ho6tZaa	ciao, gioco a bowling da diversi anni e ti posso dire che è uno sport piu complicato di quello che sembra...non ti spaventare! cominciamo dalla boccia( si chiama cosi) ne esistono almeno un migliaio che si differenziano tra loro per la geometria interna e per la copertura esterna, per avere un idea vai su ballreviews.com, ora, la mia prima boccia la comprai usata da un giocatore che aveva una foratura che mi andava bene, poi giocando ho capito quali caratteristiche avevo e quindi quali bocce comprare(ora ne ho 6) ti consiglio di comprarne una gia forata(ne trovi anche su ebay a volte) e che sia almeno reattiva o proattiva (per intenderci quelle che trovi nei bowling sono di semplice plastica e sono forate in un modo assurdo, considera che il pollice deve entrare completamente nel foro,la boccia deve poggiare sul palmo e solamente l'ultima falange di medio e anulare devono tenere la boccia, questo per imprimere alla stessa una certa rotazione in fase di rilascio).                                                                                          per imparare alcuni centri bowling hanno dei bowling clubs che organizzano tornei a diversi livelli oppure organizzano dei corsi di solito gratuiti (paghi solo le partite che fai) informati dove giochi abitualmente.                                                                                   le spese sono: la boccia, usata da 50 a 150 euro, nuova piu foratura da 100 a 300 euro- le scarpe da 40 a 180 euro(ma un modello da 50 euro va benissimo credimi)- la borsa x 1 2 3 o 4 bocce da 25 a 150 euro- e le partite che farai settimanalmente (se sei iscritto a un club o sei comunque un giocatore anche semplicemente appassionato, solitamente hai uno sconto a volte anche notevole)                                                                                           spero di esserti stata utile e ti auguro un buon 300!!!|`|ie13Rfduaa	scusa ma io adesso non ci leggo + perché ho sonno cmq se vuoi rispondi qua:<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArXPFKWSwGrsLwNZbu.SAw7wDQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20081003102619AAENoUi">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AikglCsH90kDHz9UT9Fw347wDQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20081001133841AAhf51h">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  rispondete!!! grazie a tutti<br>  ciao
yWXxkwN3aa	ive been playin for a while and spent a season with braces on, i bought a regular boil and bite mouthguard and another specialized one for braces, its made by shockdoctor. ( if you wanna see it search up shockdoctor braces mouthguard and itll pop up) the braces mouthguard was good and comfortable but it was harder to communicate and would fall out into my mouth somtime. id recomend a regular boil and bite one because itll be more solid in there and will almost lock onto your teeth because of the braces.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Yes.

YsSwe1Laaa	Without more to go on in terms of what you are seeking, one can only speak in generalities.<br>  <br>  Two important thing for beginning forwards, especially in tight five:<br>  <br>  1.  Learn the mechanics of forward play.  It is actually very technical. The technique is not only to make you more effective, it also is so that you can play safely.  Insist that your coaches teach this, because much and maybe most is not at all intuitive.  How to bind (very different for props and locks!)  How to place your feet and how your feet move when you engage.  How to crouch, including how to align your hips and shoulders (and obviously how to protect your neck and head).  You need to learn proper technqiue for scrummaging, but also for tackling, rucking, line-outs, and mauls.  There are both individual skills and also the need to develop teamwork.  Pay attention when you are receiving instruction, and then practice, practice, practice.  <br>  <br>  2.  Conditioning.  A forward playing an 80 minute game will run 8-10 km during the game, and there will be very little rest.  You need quickness (especially to 20 m) and stamina.  This comes only with training.  The good news is that training with your mates is a whole lot easier to commit to than is training by yourself, so even if in the past you have had trouble committing to a running program, it will come with your new team.<br>  <br>  Give us some more details, if you wish, and maybe the mob here - many of whom are very experienced - will be able to provide more help.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and have fun.<br>  <br>  Mark L.|`|HTiczN3Xaa	First suggestion - learn how to spell PROP correctly.<br>  <br>  Second suggestion - you'll learn a lot more from going to training and playing matches than you ever will by asking questions on Y!A

0rCIJM6Jaa	Buying new cables would help a lot, but if you're like me just use a small piece of 160 grit sandpaper, wrap it around the cable while sanding. You just need to sand the surface rust. Lightly lube after the job. Brake cables are so thick that even with some light sanding the strength won't be affected. I have a 2001 Davinci with the original rear brake cable. 4000 miles of hilly terrain|`|7ee34450d1841da0f8453815af52bcb9aa	It will cause you more aggravation than it is worth to remove the rust and there would be no guarantee that whatever you do won't prevent rust from coming back. <br>  <br>  It's much easier to have a local bike shop replace the cables with new ones and either go back yearly for a tune-up to have them lubed or do it yourself with proper cable lube.|`|S5R4yXYjaa	simply drop by your local bike shop, with your bike, and ask them if they can replace the cables. getting new housings would probably be a good idea too.<br>  <br>  they arent very expensive, so dont be afraid that it will cost a lot. labour is rather pricey, but they set it up and have you back on your bike in no time, so it's definitly worth it. also, you may want to call before you go in, some shops can book a time for you so that they can do it right away when you get there|`|385UkmgWaa	You don't you buy news ones - they're cheap. Like the old guy said above!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Replace the cables, they are cheap.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/replace-cable-housings/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/replace-cable-ho...</a>|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	If your cables are rusty they should be replaced. As you know, those cables are made up of tiny wires twisted together, and it doesn't take much for them to weaken, and rust makes them weak.<br>  <br>  Replace the cables with stainless steel versions, and the housings with compressionless type- they are quite cheap- and never have the problem again.
fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Yipes! Unless you have the correct saw guide to make it work, DO NOT USE A SAW. Instead, borrow/rent/steal a tubing cutter (just kidding about the "steal" part).<br>  <br>  1) Determine the headset stack height. This is the amount of space your headset parts take up. Usually you can find the specific dimension at an online parts supplier or you can measure carefully. <br>  <br>  2) Determine your headtube length. This is the overall length of the head tube.<br>  <br>  3) Determine the overall height of your stem where it clamps onto the steerer and any other spacers.<br>  <br>  4) Add the above information together and SUBTRACT 1/8" (4mm).<br>  <br>  5) Measure from the fork crown up the steerer and mark the length as determined in step 4.<br>  <br>  6) Cut the steerer tube... you only get one chance! I suggest that you "dry fit" the fork and make sure that the mark you made is hidden by the stem...make a mark with the stem fitted, there should be 1/8" (4mm) between the 2 marks.<br>  <br>  7) Deburr the inside and outside of the steerer.<br>  <br>  8) Insert the star-fangled nut the appropriate depth into the steerer tube.<br>  <br>  9) Install the fork.<br>  <br>  A footnote... this really shouldn't be done unless you really know what you're doing. This means getting professional help with professional tools.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NK94egwqaa	It is hard to switch a fork, including cutting the steerer to size yourself, so I strongly recommend you have it done professionally for you.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would seriously consider whether you want to carry out such a large upgrade of the fork. Unless you are upgrading all the other components too, your bike will be seriously out of balance (good fork, basic brakes/gears etc.) which won't give a great riding experience. Also your frame (cheaper XC frame that comes with a dart) may not be up to the kind of punishment a recon can take, and is probably not suitable for DJing. The last thing you want is an average bike with a decent fork that will break the first time you expose it to any sort of punishment, especially if you change the geometry of the bike by putting a longer travel fork on it.<br>  <br>  Don't let me stop you if this is what you want to do, but I would give it some serious thought before buying a new fork.

r5AMG8g7aa	You sound like a lot of people that train in a McDojo. Kids and low belts rule.. The more advanced students don't get the training they need. The comment about being able to jump over people and kick really bothers me. Why should that have anything to do with testing????  All this jumping is a waste of time. It is not wonder you are having foot problems. Personally I'd find a better place to train. sounds like they are just taking your money. Sorry to sound negative, but nothing you said sounds like you are getting proper training. Having been around martial arts all my life, I hate to see people wasting their time and money in schools that either are just McDojo or simply don't know what and how to teach.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jumpin.... What the heck are you talking about. Your comments sound like you are not what you pretend to be. None of it makes any sense. I've seen your comments before. the others were no better.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	I can only agree with pugpaws2 and nwohioguy, and think you have been had by the infamous McDojang.  Your dedication deserves better training than you have us believing you are getting.  I would suggest you check out other TKD and/or karate that is available to you.  If you look you will find a qualified instructor, you have gone too far, in my opinion to give up or stop now.<br>  <br>  As for jumpin beating up gangs, I would advise against it, and I would advise against such inappropriate posts.   J|`|3DnX9NmAaa	...When will you ever have to jump over someone to do a kick in a real situation? You won't. You should tell them that. It's unrealistic. No jumping kick will ever work in a real fight. Most TKD kicks will be very difficult to pull off in a real fight. I have nothing against TKD. I've trained in Chung Do Kwan and Moo Duk Kwan. Unfortunately, TKD is one of those things that work much better in competitions than they ever would in real life.|`|EnwwqUGZaa	Way to go Girl!  Seven years, that is great.  Take stock of the good things here.  You are a committed student, you can handle sparring bigger opponents, and you seriously want to improve.  Plus, you have a life outside the dojang which every 14-year -old should.<br>  <br>  Now the questions:<br>  <br>  Am I training enough.  <br>  Sounds like maybe training too much, but not at the level you need to be training.  The injuries from jumping indicate that you need to back off a little.  Track is not going to help that kind of impact injury.  I can relate to not having people to train with.  The higher your rank and the more skill you gain the more that is going to happen.<br>  <br>  Look for solutions, if you are not happy in the current place, hunt out another.  If you want to stay, look for opportunities to train with others at your level outside the dojang.  Visit other classes, clinics, etc.  Ask your teacher about special training.<br>  <br>  Should I test, what if I fail?<br>  I hate testing, to this day, i have always hated to fail.  I am a perfectionist in every sense of the word.  But the truth is we learn from failure.  It helps us grow and improve.  No test is ever perfect.  In 30 years, I have never heard anyone come out of a test and say, "I nailed it. It was all perfect."  Don't sweat one thing and lose sight of everything else.  If all your other stuff is top-notch, would you fail because you can't jump?  I would hope not.  Ask your teacher.  If s/he says you have to jump to pass, I would look for a new place to train.<br>  <br>  It is okay to take a break, to let your body heal, de-stress, or to find a new dojang/dojo.  I suspect training is a part of who you are now, so don't be afraid to walk away and take the time you need.  When your body is ready, you will be mentally ready to find a good place to train too.|`|Xs1cXFjPaa	You might not feel like you're training enough, but to review and master the basics is always a good thing. But if it really does feel like it's not making you improve at all, you might want to ask for private lessons from an instructor. You should also wait for your feet to recover before doing anything too intense, and I think you should be fine in three weeks. For your test, be confident in what you were taught, and if a person is there, just imagine that there is no person there, and you're just doing a normal running jump kick (I don't see why they have to put a person there..). Anyways, good luck on your test and recovery, and even if you can't do just one little thing at the test, they shouldn't fail you just for that if you can do everything else correctly.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	I agree completely with pugpaws on this one. In terms of having to jump over people to do a kick...well that is a showmanship technique most TKD schools do cause they think it gets them students. TKD in its modern form is more flashy and not very well respected...but that is up to the individual to determine...not society.<br>  <br>  I appluad you for seven years of training...and being close to your black belt exam...but IF you feel that the classes are to easy then maybe you should shop around for a better school after you get your black belt. In terms of your injuries it sounds to me like your instructor does not teach proper conditioning and stretching. I would recommend that you seek out other help since you are not being trained for the techniques you are performing. Good luck and always keep your mind open.

JXJQTgULaa	During try outs, you will learn how to do jumps, mainly toe touches, tumbling, stunting (don't worry, they will teach you, you will probably just front and you don't do very much when fronting), and cheers. The coaches will teach the entire team one cheer, and you will practice it at try outs, you won't have to say it all alone. Just make sure that when you do your motions, they are tight, and your high Vs and low Vs don't have bent elbows.<br>  You should practice your splits and heel stretches, along with open tumbling to get a back handspring or back tuck.<br>  <br>  High V<br>  <a href="http://cdn-viper.demandvideo.com/media/D..." rel="nofollow">http://cdn-viper.demandvideo.com/media/D...</a><br>  <br>  You should wear a lose fitted T shirt or tank top with a pair of cotton shorts. <br>  <br>  I am sure that you will do fine =D|`|kfdkiLzAaa	~smile the whole time!<br>  ~keep all your motions sharp & dont overextend anything!<br>  ~stretch so your jumps are good!

gBO908P6aa	It depends on where the major bout is and what the rules are.  Elbows aren't commonly used or allowed in most Western Muay Thai rules simply because of the fact that it's too damaging of a weapon.  <br>  <br>  In Thailand however, yes it is allowed...everything is allowed.  The elbow is a very dangerous and nasty short-range weapon and you need to be within a foot of your opponent in the clinch range in order to slash with it.  <br>  <br>  Elbows can also be used defensively on the outside to block and hurt an opponent's punches and kicks.  Anything it hits will cut and bruise and break.<br>  <br>  Thai fighters usually have an unspoken understanding that if you don't use it, I won't either.   Of course, this is never further from the truth based on all the countless matches you see in Thailand where elbows and ultra-bloody fights are not uncommon.  Elbow knockouts in Thailand also score well with judges and fighters can receive a higher bonus in the end.|`|nRBC4E5saa	Haha... no, it's not a "deadly strike".<br>  <br>  First, the opportunity to use them doesn't present itself too often.  While in the clinch, the arms are used mostly to control the opponent.  You'll occasionally see an elbow strike as they push away, or sometimes getting into the clinch, but once they're in there, the arms are already up by the head and can easily defend most elbow strikes.<br>  <br>  I remember hearing some talk when I was in Thailand that most fighters won't use elbow strikes in the early rounds because, traditionally, the first few rounds are a feeling out process and, because an elbow strike so easily opens up a cut, they're not used because they can end the fight prematurely.<br>  <br>  You see them used more often in the clinch in MMA.  Check out Kalib Starnes vs. Alan Blecher and Tim Sylvia vs. Brandon Vera, for starters.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	You don't see elbows used in many of the fights in the US because they don't allow it.  Even in MMA many states while allowing some things have disallowed the use of elbows for the amateur fighters as well as knees above the chest to the face and head.  This along with elbows, kicking an opponent while down are all things the state athletic commissions have said they won't allow or accept.  Most of the Maui Thai in is country is fought under American rules.  That includes leg kicks only; some are fought under European rules which include knees along with leg kicks.  None are fought under what they call traditional Maui Thai rules that include leg kicks, knees, and elbows.|`|ek6FQFiZaa	Elbows are harder to use than punches, knees and kicks because you have to first get into range.  That's tough to do against an equally skilled opponent.  Most of the time elbows are used going into or coming out of a clinch.  Once in the clinch, your hands and elbows are busy holding the opponent so you use your knees, because they're free.<br>  <br>  But I still love elbows.  Great self-defense on the street against an unaware opponent.  If a novice is throwing haymakers, you go straight inside with punches, move in close and transition to elbows, move back out and transition to punches and then if he's still standing move out of punching range and finish with kicks.  It's all about range.  <br>  <br>  The elbow is not a "deadly" power strike.  My instructor says it's for cutting, not power.  If you try to make it a power strike you are doing it wrong, will over extend and leave yourself open for attack.  Done correctly, it's used for close range, quick cutting work to put blood in the eyes.|`|A73LRTnCaa	Quick answer, they're a move used only at the right opportunity.  You need to first close the distance before you throw one, otherwise a simple jab will stop you rather easily.  <br>  <br>  You can't.. *shouldn't*... throw an elbow from punching distance (at least not against anyone halfway good), you need to be in close quarters.|`|qaiKG1Z2aa	Elbows in a thai boxing fight (show), is only allowed if under full muay thai rules. There is class a, class b, class c|`|qSKsEL1Oaa	don't know. maybe cuz most prefer to use their knees when they are close. i have seen some elbow strikes used.|`|ToIKcUdCaa	its very hard to connect an elbow and can leave you wide open, and not many fighters care all too much about the other fighters well being, i mean, there in the ring to hurt each other, only after do they care about how the other fighter is

While they are capable of a humane kill from a relatively close distance their accuracy and power prevent them from being a good choice beyond 20 yards, maybe slightly farther in well-trained hands.<br>  I would recommend a more powerful air rifle for hunting. There are many excellent choices available from many manufacturers. These are available from .177 caliber to .50 caliber, depending on what you ultimately want to hunt. For the animals you list a good .177 or .22 would suffice. There are also different choices for power supply; springers, CO@, multi-pump pneumatic and pcp (pre-charged pneumatic) in a wide variety of power levels. Look for something that shoots at least 1000 ft/ second in .177 or 850 ft/second in .22 caliber. These will produce enough ft. lbs. of energy to make a humane kill at 75- 100 yards or beyond, depending on your skill level.
0cLj35Fgaa	No air gun has huge recoil.  Airguns are so quiet that you can shoot them in your yard (as long as you have a decent backpost.  When I fired an airgun, I honestly couldn't feel any recoil at all.  You will have to get a high caliber hunting rifle to have those properties.  Any rifle that shoots 338 winchester magnum should fit the bill.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	PCP big-bore airguns will have the most recoil and noise. The noise comes from the fact that they're shooting a large volume of high-pressure, compressed air. The recoil comes from the fact that large-bore PCP airguns shoot pellets of 100, 200, 400, or more grains in weight. As far as how much and how loud... Pyramid Air rates PCP big-bores as a 5/5 for loudness (though they are still probably not much louder than a rimfire rifle shooting hypervelocity loads). As far as recoil, I've read (somewhere, I can't find the site right now) that the recoil is about on par with a .223 or .243 rifle (or maybe a .410 shotgun).<br>  <br>  Examples of PCP big-bores would be the Sam Yang 909 (.45 caliber), Shinsung Career Dragonslayer (.50 caliber) or custom guns like the DAQ .457/.458 or Barnes Justice.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	no airgun has recoil and no airgun is louder than any real gun.<br>  <br>  something with HUGE recoil would be an Anzio Ironworks 20mm rifle, <br>  something that is EXTREMELY loud would be a snubby 500 S&W revolver.|`|OrvTG44laa	Why?

1jmXT4Vvaa	Desert Eagle.  That's the only one I know.<br>  <a href="http://www.magnumresearch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.magnumresearch.com/</a><br>  Lots of people hate Desert Eagles.  They are big, they are heavy, they are expensive, and they definitely aren't for everyone.  I am 6'6" tall with hands to match.  I don't find them overly big, but most do.  They aren't for everyone, but I've found they are accurate, reliable, and fun to shoot.  Most problems stem from people that can't hold them sturdy enough for the action to work against them.  It's called limp wristing.  If your hands aren't big enough, it could be a problem.  I'd recommend getting the chance to shoot one before you shell out over $1000, you may find them too big.  If that's the case, it's better to know before than after the purchase.

BiMkowVMaa	I like Gary Payton, but the Gary Payton you're thinking of and the Gary Payton of 1992 was only avg. 9pts a game at the time. It was only his second year in the league.<br>  <br>  Obviously I would take Christian Laettner off without a doubt. I'd have to put Isiah Thomas on that team instead... he was supposedly left off the team because MJ said he wouldn't play on the Dream Team if Thomas was there (bad blood between Detroit and Chicago). Isiah deserved that spot and was robbed of playing on the Dream Team.<br>  <br>  Oh... and Chris Mullin was the West coast version of Larry Bird and definitely deserved his spot.|`|E4hNygYDaa	I agree 100% with you.

AA12050921	all my years of playing high school sports, i had problems with the refs and their calls but i just accepted it as a part of the game. players having rights changes the uniformity of the game. there is a set standard that every player knows and follows. its not like the refs are doing anything personal in making calls. they just go with what they think best follows the rules of the game to make it a fair competitive environment. i dont think its worth it to protest.|`|AA10197742	Exactly how would that work?<br>  <br>  "Excuse me, ump, but I don't think that last pitch was a strike, I'd like to submit it to an arbitration panel"<br>  <br>  Of course, then you'd be bound by the absolute power of the arbitration panel.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could make it a democracy. Players from both teams could vote on whether a pitch was a ball or a strike.  How do you think the votes would come out?<br>  <br>  So please expound further an explain how it would work above the lever of the beginner T-ball league. You know the league where everybody gets to play every game, nobody keeps score, and everybody gets a trophy at the end of the season.|`|fdbb019ffd22b0054f7654d899b91886aa	First of all, that wouldn't happen because these rules have been around before we were born and we don't know what its like without them. The athletes right is to play the game, not argue the calls with the referees. If athletes were in charge of the calls, then they would always choose the ones that were for their own team.

eFW5O92Yaa	Well it really depends on you. Quite a few of the chubbier kids can actually run pretty fast in sprints. I switch back and forth between sprints and long distance depending on who we have that day and my coach. If you're good at it you could do discus, shotput, or javelin throw.

APnVzUUFaa	A fixed gear bike may or may not be a road bike. Traditionally, most of them are, but fixed gear mtn bikes and cyclo-cross type bikes have recently become more popular and are probably more common. Fixed gear bikes were originally mainly designed for velodrome racing where braking is not as important and allowed for trackstands to be done, etc. They have now spread to the other branches of cycling. Cyclists sometimes use fixed gear bikes as an alternative method of training.<br>  <br>  The cost is usually less, but they are generally harder to find. Your selection will be less with a fixed gear.<br>  <br>  The difference between the two is that on a fixed gear bike, the pedals rotate at all times, even when "coasting". To brake, one puts reverse pressure on the pedal stroke. It is possible to install normal hand-brakes as well, though most don't come this way originally. Fixed gear track frames normally are not set up to accomodate hand brakes and don't have the brake mounting bosses on the frame and fork..<br>  <br>  Note that this is different than a single-speed or "coaster" type bike, that does allow you to stop pedalling, but only has one gear.<br>  <br>  Of course, with a fixed gear bike one has only one choice of gear, so hills can be a problem.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	A fixed gear bike is a bike with one speed and no coasting allowed.  The pedals move constantly with the rear wheel.  They use less parts and are cheaper.  Usually everyone that has a fixed gear bike also owns a multispeed road bike.|`|AX7IOl2Gaa	Most of these answers are right a fixed gear bike is a bike that wont allow you to coast meaning stop pedaling..Fixies are fun to ride than  a regular road bike and they help you build up your cardio respitory....<br>  <br>  Other than a road bike fixed gears have only one gear and road bikes ahve different types. On a road bike the gears are design for the rider shift gears to different levels determinig, the terrain and the rider. Other than that fixes only have one ratio that and is determine on the rider.<br>  <br>  ^ they say downhill is very difficult for a fixie rider and it is for the beginnner rider but it takes skill, awareness, and probably some form of courage to go downhill on a fixie in traffic. for brakes on  a fixie you have to learn to see ahead and learn how to skidd bye leanig forward and apply reverse pedaling pressure....OH yeah and alot of money for your tires wear and tear....|`|BwUSAXxqaa	As said above, the main difference is that the pedals turn all the time on a fixed. A road bike is simply a bike designed for road use, so typically has numerous gears, front and rear brakes, eyes for bag racks, mud guards etc. <br>  <br>  As a fixed bike is typically for track, it is often too closely built to fit brakes, mudguards etc. as there is not the clearance between the wheel/tyre and the frame of the bike. Fixed will only have one gear. Some fixed bikes are built so that the clearance is enough to allow for brakes etc. to be fitted, but if you desire this, check before you buy that it is possible. Braking without brakes is done through counter-pressure being applied to the pedals to slow you down; this is difficult on road when you may need sudden braking, or could be doing speed down a hill. This is why road bikes are more suitable for road use.<br>  <br>  The main use for fixed bikes is on track at a velodrome (such as you will have seen on the TV recently at the Olympics, nice work Hoy); but they are also used more recently on inner-city roads. They are trendy to have in and around London, as it is mostly flat(ish) so is suitable. If the area you are riding in is hilly, you do not want a fixed, as you will not have the gear range to manage steep hills, and cannot brakes with enough pressure to be safe on steep descents. Fixed bikes used in this way are usually customised to include a brake, and in some cases are 'single speed' rather than fixed, and have a free-hub to allow for 'coasting'.<br>  <br>  A road bike will typically have either a double or a tipple chain-set, and usually a 10 speed cassette. This gives the rider a huge spread of gears to choose from when riding, to allow them to climb, descend etc. They are virtually always built with a free-hub, allowing for 'coasting' (riding without the need to pedal). They are built with front and rear brakes, and eyes for bag racks and mudguards etc.<br>  <br>  Both of these types of bike tend to have slim tyres for speed and agility, and 'drop' handlebars to allow for a streamlined riding position. They also typically have 'clipless' pedals, meaning your shoes are clipped into the pedals while you are riding. This can be disconcerting for beginners.<br>  <br>  As said above, fixed are generally slightly cheaper, but are harder to find and there is less choice. Road bikes will be slightly more in general as there is more to them, but there is a vast range. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wiggle.co.uk/</a> is a good site to buy road bikes and equipment from, and they also have a 'single speed' section. <a href="http://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/</a> is useful also.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

They will also do a basic bike fitting because bike sizing is very important to your enjoyment of the sport (I find it to be the most important factor in bike choice).<br>  <br>  Avoid the temptation of buying from a department store or even a sports store (Sports Authority, Dick's, Walmart, Costco, etc.) because they do not have the knowledge of assembling, repairing, adjusting your bike. While their bikes offer many extras for the money, they often aren't installed correctly to provide you the benefits they promise (example I've seen is upgraded forks installed backwards). <br>  <br>  Look for entry models from Specialized, Giant, Trek, Raleigh, Jamis. There are models that range from hardcore racing models to touring to recreational/fitness to even road bikes with flat bars (ala mountain bikes but with skinny tires). Enjoy.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Visit your local bike shop, they will help you out.  If you never owned a road bike before you need someone who knows how to set up and tune a bike.

You will never be asked or expected to do anything that aggravates your health. If you have any concerns in this regard please feel free to contact the instructor who will be happy to discuss your concerns and work with you to address them wherever possible.<br>  <br>  Generally we train in bare feet, so as to reduce the risk of injury to our partners when practicing kicking techniques. However, if you have a medical condition which requires you to wear shoes (such as having insoles for 'flat feet') then it is fine to wear soft soled shoes. It is better that these shoes are kept for martial arts training rather than also being used for hiking in the dales or other outdoor activities.|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Get some tabi with a supported arch! lol<br>  <br>  No such thing dear!

jTaW3goeaa	I absolutely notice this.  I have this problem all the time, especially with the racers, they go down the hill in one line and don't care who they hit or cut off.  Everytime somebody runs into me its always a skier.      My thoughts on why they are so snobby to snowboarders is that snowboarders skills that skiers could never have even in their dreams.  I also think they expect us to give them the whole hill, well thats not a game I play.  I'm going down the hill at my speed not at the old people casual take your time speed, and since they insist on using the whole hill and give us no room, sometimes i have to get close to them to go around them.       Skiers are incredibly stuck up, trust me you're not the only one that feels this way.    Another thing about skiers, 90 percent of the people in the terrain parks that don't belong in them because they have no skills are skiers.  The sign at the entrance of the park clearly says "Freestyle Skills Required" yet you always see skiers, usually old people just casually skiing the hill, thats not what its there for.      Skiing is for old people and or people that aren't athletic enough to snowboard.    I've come to expect the hatred from skiers, just because of my riding style, I've gotten into it with a few of these stuck up skiers a few times, but honestly I'm there to have fun and I really don't care what people think about me.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	I think they are because they think that Skiing is just as hard as snowboarding, when it isnt even close, that is why when you were first trying snowboarding and you would fall ( like every snowboarder does in the beginning) the people who laughed were skiiers, because they dont know how hard it is|`|AA11441385	Whining little shits are soooo unattractive.  It is no wonder skiers look down on them.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	Usually it's the older skiers that look down on the young snowboarders. I've noticed this, too. I'm not saying all, or most, skiers are, but I do notice more skiers saying stupid stuff like telling me to get a snowboard leash when a skier right next to me has his skis fall off. It's not so much skiers, but older people who happen to ski. And people who say that skiers aren't more snobby, I'm just stating my experiences. It's kind of a stereotype for a reason. Obviously stereotypes are bad but it isn't something someone just cooked up randomly.|`|t3rmVomeaa	I ski and ride, and trust me...there are just as many asshole snowboarders out there as there are skiers.  Its your attitude, not what you stand on when going down the hill.      Skiers, do you dislike all the punk snowboarders out there on the mountain who try to generalize all of us together as snobs just because we can go faster, bigger, and harder than them?|`|CKrJ8dqTaa	i dont find skiers snobby...except for the ones who are older and havent accepted snowboarding as a sport yet. i have a good time hangin out with my frends who ski...plus they can pull you when your in the flats|`|9SYEX2zEaa	Skiers act snobby to us boarders.    Snowboarders look like retarded a**holes to the skiers.|`|hODNT0nZaa	They have always been stuck up to snowboarders. Actually it started years ago, when snowboarding first started. Most major ski companies didn't like snowboarding or the people that did it so they actually spent millions of dollars at major mountains across this whole country to ban snowboarding from mountains, and for years they actually succeeded. I remember when I was 13 snowboarding at Bear MT in Big Bear, CA and my parents going to Snow Summit the mountain next to Bear MT, but I wasn't allowed to go with them, because Snow Summit didn't allow snowboarding. I thought it was weird, but then again at one time in this country some restaurants didn't allow African Americans to eat there, so it's actually a common place for people to always hold down the new or different (did he just compare skiers to racists?)    I live and run a shop in Manhattan, NY and the surrounding ski shops to my snowboard shop in the last year have all gone out of business. That's right there is not longer a ski shop in Manhattan, NY!!!!  Skiing is a dying sport, even Transworld reports that over the last year major ski company have lost millions, because only 2% of the kids on the hill 25 and under are skiing anymore, and when they interviewed people on the hill the most common answer was that skiing was considered "Un-Cool".    So that is why they are snobs, because they are a dying breed, like dinosaurs. 40 year old dinosaurs that are on uncool skis, while all these snowboarders do circles around them. It's like when Grandpa complains about all the young kids with their hot-rods and rock music. Skiers complain about how men's and women's skiing had the lowest ratings out of every Olympic sport last time around. Even that weird event where they throw that disk thing down the bowling alley made of ice and people use those brooms to slow it down rated higher. ESPN even announced yesterday that they are discontinuing skiing in the x-games.    Their ride is over and they are pissed off about it! But seriously don't be mad at their snobbishness, I mean skiing takes guts, everyone know that they hardest part about skiing is telling your parents that you are gay...and that I am sure takes guts.    I am behind you fruit-booters! And even though I push you down when you get in my way and mock you with my friends on the chairlifts, you had a great run, with your waterproof overalls, Oakley sunglasses, and arcteryx vests with white thermals underneath. Your crew cuts and orange tans will always live on in our hearts as exactly what not to be.|`|M0IRADgWaa	I don't dislike skiers simply because they're skiers, I have good friends that are skiers. But I dislike anyone, skier or snowboarder, that acts like they own the whole slope. Now, I'm simply presenting a possibility but, some skiers out there may seem snobby because they feel that they've been around a lot longer than snowboarders and then they come in and take over, even though we don't mean to give that impression. Just a possibility.|`|7otyLHwCaa	Of course I do. They dislike us because they are upset that they can't ride like we ride, and they are jealous of our insane skills =]|`|ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	i also ski & board i would say it's about equal between the two groups yes i have noticed them but i just ignore them I'm there to have fun not to get into a fight so i all ways try to keep my distance.|`|LIKkt8djaa	No, Perhaps you're acting a certain way to make them be like that. Ski'ers are just other people just because one skis doesn't automatically make him different, labeling people isn't a good thing. Personally I've had great times and convos with ski'ers that I just meet up on the mountain sharing stories of the backcountry all sorts of stuff. But to answer your question I hate anybody who's snobby and thinks they're better than anyone else.    That's fine, perhaps it's the places you go to, high end expensive areas usually leads to snobby people. But Like I've said I've met plenty of nice ski'ers and they know i snowboard so if anything it might just be the area that you're going to.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	there just pissed cuz they still have to use two boards.

360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	Not sure were you got top 5 winning percent from.    Pitt will probably be considered "up there" but there are certainly other teams that many feel are much better franchises.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Their fans will still argue with the Cowboys fan, but I prefer Pitt's tough hardnosed style of football anyday.|`|wMh38OzVaa	No but their really close to being that|`|ntLUHiTAaa	always be second to the cowboys|`|nDzenpkwaa	you've got the NY Giants, The Green Bay Packers, the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers.      If the Steelers win they will be considered the greatest.  They will have most championships.      The Patriots aren't even close to one of the best franchises.  They are the best team of this decade and that is IT!!! The Pats didn't have a fan until the refs blew a call in the playoffs against the Raiders!|`|AA10939368	Green Bay's championships prior to the merger do not count so yes they will be.  Remember that Cleveland also had many championships prior to the superbowl and merger.  This will be their seventh superbowl appearance and if they win it will be their sixth superbowl victory, unsurpassed by noone.  If they lose then they will be close to Dallas who remains the leader with eight superbowl appearances.  They would have won at least one superbowl with three different coaches.    Dallas does not have the most superbowl wins, they have the most appearances and are tied with number of wins with the 49 ers and Steelers.  The 49ers have not done anything substantial for years, whereas the Steelers and Cowboys have remained competitive.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	yep.  1 Steelers and  2 Cowboys.|`|vJblXMwBaa	yup i think so if you look at the facts|`|SEcM9EDZaa	I think they already are, despite what the franchise that hasn't won a playoff game in 11 years (and counting) may think.|`|to5BW9Apaa	i think not. 50 years of losing before any of that. but you pittsBURGERS will think so...lol|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Not the greatest ever... but the greatest franchise in the Superbowl era, yes.     Coming from a 49ers fan... another great team in the Superbowl era.|`|Mev35gUTaa	Yes, they have a great franchise going.|`|f9e2c1711dc59ec9e6c730eee131216aaa	No because simple fact if the Pats made it they would be playing for the Super bowl.  They need to look at the rules for playoffs|`|MbcvI1A9aa	as a ravens fan i say he11 no, pats are the best franchise. if brady wasn't injured the SB would be pats vs cards.|`|AA10568753	YEAHHH  pittsburgh sixburgh.  only team to have won 6 rings, if they win, which they will!    GO STEELERS!|`|19TIPpaBaa	No because there are other great NFL football teams|`|w53izclSaa	probably not THE greatest but one of the greatest|`|MpzTnYhsaa	Definitely Not.  They are cheaters!!|`|AA10030272	Yes, if you're from Pittsburgh.  No, especially if you're from Dallas, San Francisco, Green Bay, New England, or practically anywhere else.|`|lQg2Ccbjaa	No, just the second greatest football franchise in Pennsylvania.  E..A..G..L..E..S....EAGLES.|`|wQeCtj0uaa	YES! =]|`|xoxXq3w5aa	nope|`|zCSBVAbyaa	No the Green Bay Packers. The Packers have won 9 NFL Championships and 3 Super Bowls (12 total championships). The Steelers have won 0 NFL Championships and 5 Super Bowls (possibly 6 on sunday). Therefore, the Packers are the best NFL franchise ever and the Steelers will be the best NFL franchise in the Super Bowl era, but not in the history of the game.|`|EJncsLfxaa	I would think the most winning est team(Miami Dolphins .588 win pct), or the team with the most Superbowl's wins(Dallas Cowboys 7 superbowls) be the best franchise ever don't you think? though the Pittsburgh Steelers are up there.  Have you ever thought about the Clevland Browns? sure they havent been good lately but they do have 8 championship wins 1946,47,48,49,50,54, and 1964 The Steelers have never won 5 championships in a row
H3nbC71eaa	I don't know if they wrestled before, but Mil Mascaras vs. Bruno Sammartino would've been huge in the 70's. I would pick that. Second place would go to Mil Mascaras vs. The Great Muta.|`|3icTrKLLaa	too hard to decide    I would cut it down to Guerrero, Benoit, Kobashi, Punk, and Benjamin.    After that, it's a toss up.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Since Mil Mascaras is a luchador will have to find someone with his same style.     I would either go with Bruno Sammartino, or Kurt Angle since their both good technical wrestlers and can go with the best. Plus Kurt Angle is a good worker.|`|2kVmQWF0aa	AJ styles he is the most exciting highflyer on your list.|`|1UKAho1iaa	AJ Styles. That would be an exciting match.|`|hVCiSk4Raa	The Undertaker

kYBlgFQAaa	I hope so, but I honestly doubt it.  It's in the league's best interest to have a strong team in LA.  They need to keep all of those Lakers fans engaged and interested, since they have the largest fan base in the entire league.  The Lakers have never had a sustained period of struggle.  Somehow, they always seem to pull of some miraculous transaction to keep them on top.  Go figure.<br>  <br>  Also, the modern day NBA superstar is drawn to playing in tinsel town, to enhance their visibility and image.  Playing in LA is a great marketing and career move.  Most players make a lot of money through endorsements, and LA is the place to be in that regard.  Do you think Kobe would be nearly as popular or hyped if he played in Memphis or Charlotte?  Probably not.|`|BiMkowVMaa	Nah... in 61 years the Lakers have only missed the playoffs 5 times... and only twice since 1976. They always build through the seasons. So there is rarely if ever any real drop off when a Laker great retires.|`|FUoKu13Daa	Well first of all they would in my opinion still be a playoff team without Kobe if they had a front line of Bynum and Gasol and especially the way Lamar been playing,<br>  <br>  But if you been a fan for awhile then you would know that the Lakers have a tradition of getting some of the best talent in the history of the league,<br>  <br>  Chamberlain, West, Baylor,  Jabbar, Johnson, O'neal and Kobe. and after each one retired this same question been ask " will the Lakers suck" and what happens The Lakers have a good record when a star retires not a great record except when Elgin Baylor retired that is when the Lakers had that 33 games winning streak and won the NBA championship but, <br>  <br>  Mark my worked when Kobe retires the Lakers might take a little bit of a nose dive but I believe they will still be a playoff team but they will get another super star of the league to keep the tradition going of having that marquee player and my guess it will be Kevin Durant.<br>  <br>  Edit: Teams like the lakers and Boston or even New York are like College teams where players if they have their choice will go to one of these markets to play and so the Lakers would alway have the best talent wanting to play there.|`|9iB1AiQlaa	Nope. Did the Lakers suck after Wilt retired? How about Magic? The Lakers are a dynasty and will pretty much always be good. The hardly ever suck at anything. They might miss the playoffs, but by then the G.M. will have drafted young players and also signed free agents. Everyone wants to play for L.A. just like the Cowboys in football or the Yankees in baseball. They are all dynasties.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Unless they find a great player or something close like that yea|`|NJtjJA8Baa	Not for long, they will get high draft choices after about 2 years.|`|7bx2XQlqaa	Well thats tough to predict.  Its too early, Kobe still has at least 7 or 8years left in him and by then we could have even more young talent.  But I do know that Bynum will be here for a long long time and he's got potential to be the best center in the game in a couple years.  Ariza is very young, so is Farmar.  Pau is only 26 or 27 I believe, so we are a very young team.  Kobe is the second oldest player behind Fish. So, I highly doubt the Lakers will suck in 7 or 8 years.  We could be even better than we are now, hahaha probably not, can't get much better than how we are right now.|`|uwx7etCXaa	I dont know about them "sucking"  I think that all teams go through a slump after a very good player retires.  Remember how Utah hit a slump after the Mailman and Stockton left?  The Bulls hit rock bottom after MJ, but they slowly have come up, not too far up.  Even the Lakers hit a slump; remember the 96-97 playoffs when the final shot was taken by a not-so-good player at the end of game 5 I think it was?  That not-so-good player attempted a 3-pointer and didn't even drew rim, that was Kobe, and the Lakers were on a slump.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	all the young players on the Lakers are all learning from Kobe right now. we already have our big man in the middle, and we are building Farmar right now. we might fall of the scale for a season or two but we wont be down for long.|`|5a16b1497fd05d47f5d38ed5213418c7aa	If kobe retires then they will no longer be a contender team.|`|SMX228Olaa	They will probably just be average.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	unless they sign leBron or something, then yea.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	no we will get another superstar.
Jy7t6grDaa	i'm a huge Orton fan, honestly i don't know but i will give u all the info i've obtained.    WWE Writers are pushing really hard for a heel to face flip from Randy Orton. But they are waiting for the right time and for Orton to agree to it.    Orton feels he plays a better heel than face but remember how everyone loved him when he turned face against Evo.    Also there really is nobody else that plays a good heel like Randy Orton on Raw, they could always bring edge over  from SD, but then we would have an abundance of faces on Raw. i mean honestly who will they turn heel? John Cena lmao... they ruined his career with all that corny **** he does its impossible for him to ever change and that will just bore people. Honestly without Orton right now Raw would be a joke.    Another view point is if they turn orton face they will take all of Legacy and turn them face and probably bring in a heel stable.|`|2kVmQWF0aa	When he wants to or when WWE wants him to.|`|FJO5wqsvaa	when he faces john cena at wrestlemania    thats when triple h went heal back in 2007|`|zOw0Ta5Oaa	randy orton will turn face when a stryline in wee tells to but for now hell stay a heel, but orton is was better as a heel than a face cause his cockyness so i hope wwe doesn't make him a face|`|rknbEJkzaa	Better be never.|`|725d66bc53921542e261307463e090f6aa	Never|`|17kowr6yaa	Not as long as he remains on Raw. If Orton turns face, you need an equally big drawcard as Raw's main heel. Cena WILL never turn heel. Maybe Batista but I doubt it. Jerico and JBL can't replace Orton as top-heel. So as long as Orton stays on Raw, he'll be the heel.  He could turn face if he goes to Smackdown but not while Edge is still there because Edge is the big heel on Smackdown. If after the draft Orton goes to Smackdown and Edge goes to Raw, then Orton may turn face. Edge will then be the top heel on Raw.|`|D8jcgdcpaa	NOT ANY TIME SOON LOL

afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	The first answer gave you your info, but, Dirty Harry used a S&W Model 29 .44 magnum, not a .357.|`|TLgiTFh4aa	It does refer to the calibre of the bullet... a 9mm is well, 9mm wide, and a .357 is 0.357 of an inch wide.  Not wishing to be pedant, but I'm pretty sure Clint's weapon was a .44 Magnum.. indeed the most powerful hand gun of the time.|`|sM8PKUtoaa	its the bullet power or something|`|AA11573840	This refers to the caliber or width of the bullet. The difference is one is referred to millimeters and the other in inches. 9mm is actually .354 inches. .357 = 9.067mm. They are almost the exact width but the .357 holds a much bigger charge(more gunpowder) making it a lot more powerful.|`|lmWqwpygaa	Dirty Harry's gun was a 44 Magnum-not a 357.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	They're a very rough guide to the diameter of the bore or the diameter of the bullet. There are an awful lot of misnomers, though, so don't take them too seriously. For instance, Harry's 44 Remington Magnum has a diameter measured across the grooves of .429", and of course the diameter measured across the lands is even smaller. Don't ask why. If you really want to know the specifics of the dimensions, you have to look up each one individually. In the US, the governing body that standardizes these dimensions is SAAMI (the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute); in Europe, it's CIP (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes a Feu Portatives).|`|dfBwVxXFaa	it refers to the calibers/ dia. of the bullet. And also if it says magnum it is als referring to the powder charge.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	I believe Dirty Harry used a 44mag.... a 9mm is about the smallest you can effectively use for self defense, and that only at very close range... a 357 is just a 38 special but a bit longer so has more powder... a 38 or 357 is the best all-around self defense weapon... with the 40 auto next..  simply stated the bigger the number the bigger the bullet... usually...

FFE9Qztzaa	Aston Villa will definitely acquire a permanent spot in the top 4.     Realistically, Arsenal is getting pushed out.   Aston Villa may probably maintain that status for one season. That is, If Wegner doesn't make any silly mistakes and decisions in regards to its squad.|`|Hiasgb75aa	I think so.

iO12Vjnvaa	I think he was finally honest with him....Kyle should have got out years ago. He makes a great ambassador for our sport and a great announcer....Kyle just doesn't have what it takes to drive competitively any more....and that's coming from someone who has pulled for the Petty family for 30+ years. Just an opinion as always.|`|500b01b2c821cf9bf9cbf4aaebd13417aa	HEY YOU KNOW WHAT if it wasnt for KING RICHARD litte kyle wouldnt have POOPIE in his life so long live KING RICHARD|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	You aren't going to like this BUT  It is long overdue that Kyle retire.  He never was a contender.  No, Richard isn't doing him wrong.  Kyle should be treated like everybody else.  If you don't perform, you are OUT.    Richard has allowed Kyle to drive too long already.  Kyle is a good man, but a terrible driver.      Look at the stats;   2008 15 races -0 top 10 finishes,    2007 35th in final points   1 top 10 out of 29 races and that was because half of the field wrecked at Charlotte//    2006 - 32nd in points overall with 2 top 10's and 0 top 5's     2005 -27th overall with only 2 top 10's.;;;    2004-33rd  2003-37th    You can't show me one driver with stats that bad who was allowed to stay in the same car.  If it wasn't for Richard, Kyle would have been out of Nascar a long time ago.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Why would he be a pecker head to his own son?  He has no reason to be disappointed in Kyle. Kyle's a good person, has a heart of gold, and is extremely charitable.   Regardless of the fact that Kyle is not the racer his father was, doesn't mean he would be disappointed in him.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I don't,Kyle needs to start announcing full time.|`|muc8sq9naa	I think the King is very proud of his son, no matter what his accomplishments are or aren't!  He's not the one who fired Kyle anyway.  I think somebody had to make the decision for Kyle to "retire" from driving.  He paid a great tribute to Adam (RIP) just racing as long as he has.    *JAKD*|`|zii6IWHoaa	there is no way anyone could have a son who does as much as Kyle does for kids and other charities and be disappointed in them.     Like I tell everyone, Kyle is a champion in a race more important than NASCAR.  LIFE

AA11488609	my team is local, which is why.  The Wizards are now the absolute worst team in the NBA, but we'll see what happens in the second half of this season, which doesn't look too good.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	it runs in the family. my dad has been a lakers fan since the magic vs bird days. then my brother liked them. now i like them. fan since i was like 4 or 5.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Because my dad is a Laker fan...  ---------------  umm...whats not to believe?|`|KdhNCnEjaa	My family has owned season tickets since 1962, I am not a Celtics bandwagoner, I am a fan, born and raised|`|khbLZQHIaa	I live in Cleveland.|`|FEViNlQMaa	I like them because they are hated. I'm talking about Spurs and I have been a fan of them since Robinson is paired with Duncan. Besides  getting championships, I like them because I love black, they look balance and has been declared as the highest winning sports franchise for the past 10 yrs and smartest too!    BTW I love Amar'e Stoudemire|`|2dgVkcVAaa	i like Magic|`|faIaIvDiaa	because mine has a big tall chinese guy in it.|`|RJghPceKaa	im fron new york, and i never thought id say this before 2010....we have a chance to get the 8th seed!    go knicks|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I like the Grizzlies because they're the local team for me.    It sure as hell ain't because of all the championships they've won, let's put it that way.|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	i never payed attention to basketball because my dad never bought games but now he does so now i love basketball(cavs) he started buying them since we got lebron but yeah all boston team fans are bandwagoners because who would like boston anyway they suck (the city) but cleveland to the heart|`|t1uKdzmLaa	Raptors - they have their ups and downs definitely but nonetheless, entertaining to watch when they play good. Plus, I am a fan of Chris Bosh and I love his heart and passion for the game.    Spurs - I have always been a Spurs for as long as I have been a Raps fan. I like the Spurs because no one on that team tries to hog the spotlight and they play unselfish basketball. In addition, Tim Duncan is another favourite player of mine.     I generally support teams that stay under the radar. :)|`|tY3rZSsiaa	since ive lived in dallas for like 15 years. im also a celtic fan, but only because ive alwasy been a huge fan of kg.  i used to root for kg against dallas, except in the playoffs.|`|P93I8CHtaa	because they are the best team|`|RL3EVSW2aa	because they are the home town team [ detroit pistons]|`|bgyMsoe5aa	because they can win games. I always root for the teams with the best records such as the Yankees and Lakers|`|ZCbkpnroaa	when i was a little boy 4-6 i loved Micheal Jordan but i only watch a couple of games i forget know but the BULLS will always be my team|`|K8lxbOdqaa	i like the cleveland cavaliers..cuz i always have i live in 513 (cincinnati) and cavs are the only ohio basketball team...and they have lebron & other really good people|`|vuh0i3Axaa	i have 3 teams that i really like... they are also my favourites...     Toronto Raptors- they are my home team.. no matter what their record is they will still be my favourite team     Philadelphia 76ers- my dad used to be a Philly fan... Andre Iguodala is one of my favourite players.    New Orleans Hornets- Chris Paul IS my favourite player.. i love their jerseys|`|xDDNCKvlaa	Bobcats because I live in North Carolina.|`|PjFLDSmdaa	I like the Cavs because I cheer for every Cleveland sport which is how I got hooked on them. I started watching the NBA when I was in about 6th grade (before I was all NFL and MLB) which is also around when LeBron came to the Cavs. He's probably the reason I'm as obsessed as I am over basketball, but much of the reason is my love for the city of Cleveland. And that I believe someday, despite what people say, the luck will change and that those who left to cheer on other teams will be sorry!|`|m7Fubhcwaa	Well my all time favorite team since their 16-66 1982 season has been and will be the cleveland cavs.  My other favorite teams are, miami, orlando, portland and chicago.    Here are the reasons why i like those teams:  Cleveland:I grew up in cleveland, cavs current team has my favorite player  j.j. hickson!  He's gonna be a good defender some day.  Big z can shoot, rebound and defend,.  Mo williams will light it upp from any where.  Delonte west can shoot and steal.    Miami:One of my home states that this city is in.  I like miami's rookies, their rookie center anthony, beasly and i love mario chambers!    Orlando:Basically the same reason as the heat except, i like howard, reddick and nelson.  Orlando can score inside and outside.    Chicago:This team has potential, before the beggining of this season i became a fan of this team because i love their young players.  Players such as rose, thomas, my favorite florida and chicago player of all time  noah, ben "flash"gordon and hinrich.  The main thing this team needs though are two big guys who can score inside, they shoot the ball from the outside way too much.    Portland:Well, first of all because of ohio state's greg oden, i love this guy's defense.  The other big reason i love this team is because of all of their big men, they can all score, and most can defend.  I became a fan of this team after they drafted greg oden and will remain a fan 4life.      Overall my favorite teams are teams with good, fast big men.|`|pLRKlm9laa	My favorite team is the New Orleans Hornets because they have Tyson Chandler and Chris Paul, they are my favorite. Two years ago my mom went to New Orleans and bought me a shirt from there and Ive liked them ever since.|`|WYMsOPOhaa	born in Cali    and im not a bandwagon, just wasnt on here in 07.
BnFvdIdxaa	Not a big fame of them. You should ask Gary Bettman.|`|XuGFt3boaa	I'm a Pens fan.  The Lighting just need some offensive talent.  Look for them to try to get a big time player in the trade deadline.  If the Lighting franchise was no more, nobody would care expect for Lighting fans.|`|I5OKJKaRaa	I hate Tampa Bay.|`|QSShHlRiaa	i'd care! unless they sent vinny lecalvier to us!|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Apparently some still care, they are still selling (or giving away in some cases) over 16,000 tickets per home game and still are averaging around 14000 in actual attendance (not great but it could be worse). Bad moves and a questionable ownership cant be helping  but they arent bleeding cash like some other franchises are at the moment. Now if Bill Davidson hadnt been so kind as to finance a big chunk of the sale (he has the proper leverage of building ownership) they might be in a different world of hurt but this is a franchise that is shooting itself in the foot with questionable spending (Malone was badly overpaid among other iffy moves) and otherwise just poor personnel management (alienating Boye surely didnt help fill the lockerroom with trust over management). Hiring Melrose (and looking foolish in the removal of mullethead) only made things worse but if they ever get it right they do draw well when winning, winning seems to solve many issues with most teams. And I am hoping to retire to that general area soon so add one more to the list of people who care (I might not specifically root for them but at least I wil have a place to go). There are enough "snow-birds" to keep them viable if they get it right.|`|VC5mEULTaa	There aren't any lightning fans- they jumped on the bandwaggon and became HUGE Blackhawk fans.|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	I know several people who would have huge issues if Tampa disappeared. There are a bunch of Tampa fans on this site. I do know that the city up there actually cares as well.|`|AA11674745	After the Melrose Experiment failed, and the novelty of "Tocchy Hockey" has petered out, reality has shown that it can be a Rosie McDonnell.<br>  <br>  I've read nothing to get excited about unless you are into the Tavares Sweepstakes.<br>  <br>  P.S.

u8GHTJEEaa	As Vince was walking out to his limo (just before the explosion) on the June 11, 2007 episode of Monday Night RAW, Paul London could clearly be seen smiling (like an idiot, as some have described it) when Vince passed by. The rest of the wrestlers and the staff members had solemn looks on their faces. London caught huge heat for this. Here's a link to a picture of "The Smile": <a href="http://www.wrestlingforum.com/general-wwe/349666-vince-furious-paul-london.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.wrestlingforum.com/general-ww...</a> Scroll down a little bit, you'll see it. This was not the first huge mistake Paul London made in 2007. A week or so earlier he let the cat out of the bag about Ashley Massaro being on Survivor. London would have been fired then, but Ashley (who was his girlfriend at the time) went to bat for him. <br>  <br>  After the smile, London was rarely seen again on WWE TV, in small part due to injury, in large part due to the above transgressions. He was eventually fired November 7, 2008.|`|uqIhD61caa	Yeah, he was shown on screen that he was smiling. On a recent interview he said he was smiling because he "thought the angle was so ridiculous."
nqBhFyt7aa	Here are some stretches to improve your toe touch:<br>  <br>  <br>  1.) Start with your Hamstring stretches - Your hamstring muscles are the biggest problem when it comes to flexibility, so it's good to isolate them right away. Start by standing with your feet together and bend down to touch your toes (keep your legs straight). NOw go to a wall, place both hands on it and stick one leg bend forward and one leg straight back in a lunge position. Keeping your feet flat on the ground, focus your attention again on your hamstrings remembering to alternate each lunging leg.<br>  2.) Half straddle - Sit with one leg forward and 1 leg bent. Stretch straight down to your straight leg while making sure it does not bend. <br>  <br>  3.) Bent knee straddle forward - Start in a straddle with bent knees, and grab your toes. For the stretch, straighten your legs to full extension if possible and stretch.<br>   <br>  4.) Forward Straddle - Start in a straddle and reach down in front of you, remembering to keep your legs straight<br>  <br>  Good Luck [:|`|blSlwcIiaa	<a href="http://cheerwiz.com/cheerjum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cheerwiz.com/cheerjum.htm</a>

bvVG3Xnhaa	The first time is always scary, but don't worry its normal to be scared to get hit. Make sure you wear your headgear and pads before you spar. Remember everything you learned in class and utilize it in your sparring. Make sure you BREATHE, a lot of people get so worked up the first time they forget to breathe and gas out very quickly. Remember this is a learning experience talk to your coaches they will help you too.|`|7kSRaDEOaa	Don't gas out don't fight out of anger always breath first round test the other guy see what he has don't be scared to get hit wear your mouth piece head gear shin pads and gloves you always want to think two steps ahead try counter ever move throw your kicks but not too much because it gases you faster have a clear head and always always have fun and learn off the other person <br>  <br>  Hoped I helped you some <br>  Good Luck and have fun!
bvVG3Xnhaa	I'd go with boxing your learning how to fight with your hands and keep people at a distance and if they come close you can brawl with them without getting scared. That is if you spar in class. It would be good to know some wrestling too in case they try to get you onto the ground you can defend yourself.<br>  <br>  But the best thing to do if your ever in a fight in the street is to avoid it at all cost, because you never know if this person will have a weapon on them.|`|BZMPax7Naa	In the streets you better be versed in multiple disciplines.  For certain you better know how to grapple.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	On the streets anything goes.  The best advice is to do whatever style works in the situation.<br>  <br>  You don't want to get someone in an armbar when fighting on concrete, because they can slam you.  (Noah Thomas v. Marlon Sims on TUF)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mmablaster.blogspot.com/2008/01/video-of-day-bas-and-bar-fight.html" rel="nofollow">http://mmablaster.blogspot.com/2008/01/v...</a><br>  ^Bas Rutten in how to fight during a bar fight.|`|gBO908P6aa	If you want to be prepared for anything in the street then study every bloody art out there.  Problem is, nobody can study everything and nobody has the time or money to do that.  Different styles only spend time in certain areas of combat.  Muay Thai works in the clinching, punching and kicking range.  Jiujitsu works the clinching/grappling range.  TKD emphasizes long range attacks with kicks.  Boxing emphasizes punching.  Therefore, for the most part, styles are all inefficient in their own way for dealing with the countless possibilities in a street situation.  There is no definitive style.  <br>  <br>  Only systems that emphasize training in everything unarmed and armed, single or against many, standing up and on the ground, in a phone booth or in a football field, etc can be deemed the "best technique" for self-defense in an "anything goes" situation.  These are rather hard to come by.  <br>  <br>  The only one that might come to mind is Jeet Kune Do which is a martial training methodology (not a style) geared for creating a well-rounded, complete fighter through attribute development and the study of universal techniques from many different styles.|`|5SCMfucFaa	I would recommend Muay Thai on the grounds that it is sort of in between being a martial art or boxing. The problem with many martial arts is often they deal too much with things such as forms and totally unnecessary techniques, wheras things such as kick boxing do not often put enough refinement into their techniques. Go for Muay Thai as the best option.|`|oTb67zNYaa	avoidance and travel in groups when you can this is the best (technique) I have found for self defense not my only technique nor should it be it is simply the first defense then comes your martial art of choice or weapon of choice depending on your personal preference how hard you train with that determines its effect|`|0YkLvjgcaa	I agree with the answers so far that stress cross-training.<br>  <br>  The only problem with this is that it gets expensive, and who has the time to go to multiple schools throughout the week?<br>  <br>  My best suggestion would be to train at a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu school that also offers Muay Thai. Obviously you can add on to your disciplines as you see fit at a future date (I would probably add Greco Roman Wrestling  next or Judo) but I think BJJ + Muay Thai are a great base.<br>  <br>  You'll be strong striking/clinching with Muay Thai, and the BJJ will help you finish things on the ground should you choose to go there. <br>  <br>  One more thing - please keep in mind that someone trained in BJJ also is more likely to have the option to NOT go to the ground, or to get off the ground should they choose to - this is a oft-neglected point when people discuss BJJ for street application.
YDpT2ClBaa	there are no guarantees in training for self defense. there are a lot more variables then just time. it depends on you, how good your instructor is, how hard you train. and so forth.<br>  <br>  more then likely if you train hard you will have a basic self defense knowledge. you may not be able to win all of them but you should be able to hold your own|`|XaSIyG0Paa	Its definitely possible, I used to play football and wrestle and when I fight I use my body to mess dudes up, I keep myself pretty toned since high school, good luck beating up whoever you need to beat up.|`|TnTXGNyMaa	yes for sure, thats enough time to use muay thai in a fight. The thing with muay thai is that its a style of fighting, most people that do muay thai, fight as muay thai fighters, this is the thing with boxing or kick boxing also. what helps is full contact sparring. I have been doing bjj for a while now and after my 8 months of training a while back, i got in a fight at my senior dance, guy tackled me down, hit me twice and i ended up getting the bigger guy in a triangle coke and passed him out after about 8 seconds.. that was all out of instinct.

Aj16de8Aaa	a handspring is when you trow yourself backwards onto your hands. Then sort of bounce of your hands to land on your feet. You could also do this frontwards. DO NOT attempt this without a coach helping you. You could break your neck. so be careful and good luck!|`|YM2ED4mfaa	if you want to try it, do it with a spot, or double spots to help keep you up (so you dont hit your head on the floor) and to help kick your legs over once your hands hit the floor.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I think Vince could book Randy Orton in a handicap match at No Way Out vs Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes with Shane McMahon as the guest referee.It's to ensure that Vince gets some payback on Orton for what he did to Vince on Raw.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	I hope Vince get Orton sooner then later! if that shane match does go down I hope it a four corners match! that way Orton can't leave the ring!|`|3icTrKLLaa	the World Heavyweight Championship|`|NRs72Afxaa	A gimmick match between Ortan and Shane at No way out, and probably after WM a match between Ortan and Vince Mcmahon with Ortan as Whc. just an opinion.|`|T13xM9iJaa	He would be in a match with Shane at No Way Out and this is why I think that.    This plan was set up by Randy and Stephanie and this is how    I mean look at it Stephanie wants all the power and is a 4th generation diva so what dose she do ask Randy to take out her dad and in return she will not only join Legacy but give Randy equal power as GM. So now that Vince is out of the picture, Shane is next. What is gonna happened is that over the next few week leading up No Way Out they are going to be hyping this storyline. Then at No Way Out Steph is gonna make some match like a no DQ match or something like that during the match both Randy and Shane are gonna be going back and forth then Shane is just weak and can't go on that is when Randy will punt Shane. Then being that Steph is ringside she run in to check on Shane then she get up with a VERY angry face then turn around and starts to smile and shake hands with Randy. Revealing that she and Randy where working together all along.    Also history shows that Stephanie has turn on her family to gain more power.|`|gVlTlpb2aa	stephanie will start dating randy orton|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	LETS WAIT AND SEE|`|EbTtmXViaa	Punt to Shane Mcmahons head.  Like father like son.|`|wosSPy0Taa	main eventing WM|`|FJO5wqsvaa	shane o mac vs. Randy Orton in a no dq match at no way out|`|Nzqt4Qu7aa	Hmmm that could be possible. I did think it was funny that of all the guys Randy Orton went against Shane McMahon was the one that made him really weak when he was leaving the ring, like he was falling all over the place & Ted had to help him up and stuff.   :D|`|f4de45631130f3426bea2b772f72ba55aa	He will win the WHC at WM!|`|rknbEJkzaa	Taking Shawn Mcmahon apart.
OZne7oWraa	You cant be that bad if you play for a team and you win matches, evan world class footballers make terrible mistakes just play your best. Thanks|`|tXKLN473aa	i feel the same way when i am playing my soccer game!! But, just remember that it is not the end of the world!! At least that is what my dad tells me!! lol|`|wmm3Ktxjaa	Dude, there's no use crying over spilled milk. If you don't shoot, you'll never score. Of course there's some degree to that. You try to aim, you time, and try. Even the world class shooters miss sometimes. The key thing to be successful is to have confidence. You have to play with joy as well. To be a star, you have to want to shine. Can't do that without confidence. Now walk with your chest out.|`|zQdYBoSpaa	Ive been playing soccer since i was 5 years old and im 14 now. And if you don't want to feel bad at yourself just wacth how the other people play and im sure there are alot of other kids that are worse at soccer then u think you are. Also if i miss a shot i just keep on trying to make up for the bad shot.  Don't cry its just a game instead of crying take it out on the ball.|`|45I3X5U5aa	That's just part of being an athlete. Raw emotion. The only thing I can tell you is not to let missing a shot get into your head. That would happen to me sometimes and I would play the entire game terribly. Just stay headstrong! Just learn to shake it off! Instead of cutting yourself down on a missed goal, connect an awesome pass with a teammate to boost your self esteem back up! Confidence is key!|`|DTzWlHqwaa	Dunno
4c7b9e16b013d7a80f814a8aba5339dcaa	Just stick you cock in it's fanny|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Why the hell are you asking this in the Australian football section? If you were a breeder you would know how to go about this. Now go to the correct section before I report you!|`|f9hiPMDxaa	You could try posting this in the correct section.|`|DA2Ei0yxaa	Sorry, but this is the Rugby League section. Maybe there is a section on dog breeding or pets, try that one. You might also try not to ramble on with your question, I got tired of it halfway through and left the rest unread.|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	What was that???? You want to mate with your bulldogs??? You sick freak!!!!|`|vvpiYDqSaa	Have you tried playing Barry White?    Seriously this is a football section, if you cant even post in the right section or spell licensed correctly... then how can you expect Rugby League fans to care as to whether they give you a good answer or not.    Last resort.. put a bag over the Males head (as he must be really ugly) or.. get the Female really drunk.|`|C8XEeBSDaa	Seppo can't you read this is the  Australian Rugby League not the American Bulldog breading section give your dog a Bone!
GvnQESq6aa	To become a good skater you need a skating instructor.  Look for one who has achieved success with their students.  Watch other skaters.  The skaters of a specific coach should have similar qualities.  Pick a coach who isn't afraid to let their students test and compete.  You need private lessons and must practice.  You learn to skate by being on the ice.  How did your daughter learn her spins and jumps?  Check out a coach's qualifications.  Does the coach belong to the PSA?  You can learn many bad habits that are very hard to fix without a good coach.  Learning the correct way to skate at the earliest possible age is the smart way to go.  Make sure you have the best equipment you can afford.  Don't just pick a coach because they say they are the best.  What is the relationship with their students?  Do the skater's seem happy?  Some parents do not give out good advice.  The people in the office at the rink do not know who to hire or much about skating.  Ask several coaches about their teaching and their skating philosophy.  Once you begin testing and competing go to other rinks and watch the skaters.  Don't just limit yourself to one rink.  If you find yourself in a bad arrangement with a coach stop this and find another one.|`|es2RDKqQaa	Check out some local clubs for more information. Look in the phonebook under skating clubs.|`|0Z7sxpbcaa	If she is serious about skating then go to the rink and get a flier with all the coaches names. I would suggest putting her in like an academy or learn to skate class with others that are at her level. To me she seems like she would be about Delta or freestyle 1 level. but definitely invest in a quality coach that she is comfortable with and motivates her|`|fgMurwHSaa	Find a coach that fits her style.One of my daughters tends to daydream, and she is not very persistent.Her coach is very serious about skating and my daughters skating.The other one works very,very hard at it and we got her a coach that will help her succeed later on in competitions.Usually,a person at your daughters level needs one group lesson,one practice ice,and one private lesson a week.  A good coach also depends on the age of your daughter.If she is 3-12,then a younger coach might better fit her needs.One of my daughters coaches is 21,but the others is 40.Normally I would not suggest this,but his student had a group lesson with him and loved it.  Good luck!|`|L3VbnH1faa	it depends. if she wants to and other kids at her level are doing twice a week it might be something to look into. i've been skating for almost 3 years now and I find that twice a week is too much for me (and my mom's wallet. :P) so I only do it monday's now instead of mondays AND thursdays
YlGjkF4gaa	Well most F1 drivers started at a very very very young age.   They started with karting won everything possible to win in karting then went to the next category like Formula A world series etc. then to Formula 3000 or Formel renault or Formula bmw and some went to GP2 after that. And then some but not a lot make to Formula 1. I mean there are 20 formula 1 drivers and 1000 of people are trying. So it's hard work, discipline, talent !! and some luck.     Formula 1 drivers start gettting sponsored at the age of 10 in these days because karting is  is already really expensive, more expensive then most other sports and then think of how much the other categorys cost, that's why they get help from development teams from mclaren/bmw etc and if you aint the talent there looking for, they won't even try you.    So if your not 3 years old and already starting to drive karts or your not a billionaire with the best contacts in the buisness. I'm really sorry but, then it's bad luck for you.|`|YIW1KIi6aa	practice makes a man perfect|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Working your way through the Karting leagues, getting lucky, and a crapload of cash.|`|zjwJQUDXaa	right first you have to do go karting then be in formula renalt the formula 3 then gp2 then f1 all to geather in pounds 600,000 to buy parts and cars.
s9Pwnb87aa	You drank out of his loafer didn't you?    Shoot that boot ooh aah.  Shoot that boot ooh aah|`|JKQKG3tQaa	Is this story realy about you?|`|ntLUHiTAaa	u always say dat weird @ss $hit about you watching famous people $hit it is kind of weird. and now about smelling feet its not funny|`|4blCVEvOaa	Consider yourself lucky that he didn't require you to smell the underside of his balls before agreeing to a picture with your date buddy. I have very little doubt that you would have accommodated his request.    You really need to quit being such a pushover....especailly in public.|`|360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	Because he can. Why would someone smell another person's foot?
tzRyeX62aa	www.thebesteleven.com has a link to many different football stadiums on its website.  Maybe type in stadiums in the search bar.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	some have a capacity of 25000    where some are up to 75000      what do you need it for would help|`|rOwKvsbAaa	Kenan Memorial Stadium hold 60,000 people, Home of the North Carolina Tar Heels Football team.  There are tons if you want a different stadium just look at the link below.|`|DTzWlHqwaa	Depends how big the stadium is
rvE7gyuUaa	I am a Flyers fan and love Carter, but its going to be Ovechkin.  Carter is too streaky and doesn't have too much help on his line.  Plus Philly spreads the powerplay unit into two groups.  Washington loads up the talent on Ove's unit and they all seam to be looking to set him up.  Vanek will be a close third.|`|PyAxwuqWaa	your mom|`|AA10030272	Alexander Ovechkin|`|Q8amh0rUaa	Ovie baby.|`|LRyHqvFAaa	probably Ovechkin|`|AA10378030	Pavel Datsyuk GO WINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HNEWf7ILaa	Alex Ovechkin.|`|dRBbrmxqaa	Malkin|`|33cd510071aa809f2f5d7ecebf06b3c4aa	Ovechkin.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Alexander Ovechkin. Possibly back-to-back MVP's as well.|`|8aFOSlHWaa	Thomas Vanek!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'll say Ovechkin; god knows he never saw a shot on goal he didn't like.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Either, Ovechkin or Carter|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I'm hoping Parise keeps his pace that would be a nice surprise, a Devil with a scoring title, who would have thunk.
DPcIjHHZaa	Don't blink ahh you missed it Satino got eliminated|`|2cH8JeVNaa	Soo freakin funny. "I wasn't ready!" I was laughing so hard!|`|XSnKAQOvaa	Wow, he beat the Warlord's record of 2 seconds. Santino is definitely a future hall of famer!|`|uEj6jS24aa	oh me n ma bro always laugh at his shenanigans! he is such a clown..my bro didn't watch the rumble and wen i told him about santino he cudn't stop laughing!............ at the rumble wen santino got eliminated and chucked out of the ring...he  started screaming ' I WASN'T READY,I WASN'T READY! gosh he is a joker!|`|a1c79820b82a16475aa4c959f6efd44eaa	Not really cool but it was hilarious I hope they do more with this guy.|`|6u2YkXjlaa	hilarious rotflmfao|`|FEViNlQMaa	Unbreakable|`|QoA9v1LGaa	lmao.|`|it2UVkF4aa	Satino Marella = a wasted talent.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	He runs down the ramp looking very serious gets in the ring Kane comes over knocks him out in 1.9 seconds=funny
BiMkowVMaa	Because he's overrated. Amar'e is a scorer. If he ever decided to play real defense and rebound with a vengeance than he'd finally get that MVP consideration that he wants given to him instead of earning it.|`|hRwtEn4Raa	Because he doesn't get in double figures often enough.  He is not that good of a rebounder, or if he is he doesn't do it.  And although he might have some good games he is not consistent.  I don't think he's all star starter material|`|fLHuAKGmaa	rebounds are about will. Amare only wants to score. He doesn't care at all about rebounds. So he only goes up for one if he feels like it. That's why he will never be great.|`|21J0IIZbaa	Shaq takes some of his rebounds.  Before Shaq, Marion would take the rebounds.|`|FEViNlQMaa	Because Shaq is getting the half of it|`|2VVgxFDKaa	he just isnt a great rebounder.  He has the capability, but he doesnt do it for some reason.|`|plTYZU85aa	Well, because back when Mike D'Antoni used to run that fast break offense, he wouldn't go for the rebound, he would run up the court and score, thats why he averaged so much points, and not as much rebounds.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	Now: Shaquille O'Neal    Before: Suns Offensive Style and Shawn Marion
