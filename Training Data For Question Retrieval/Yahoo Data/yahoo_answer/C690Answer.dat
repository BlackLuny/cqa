But I believe it's because I want to look good and make a nice impression so he thinks I'm hot and stuff so I'll always feel like there's something wrong with me, like is my hair ok? or does my outfit look cute enough? and etc. So, yes, I can be very shy around a good-looking guy especially if he is taking interest in other girls and not me, it would make me feel like there's something wrong with me or I was ugly or something.

You'd be best just moving on and ignoring them, reporting them to a school councillor or something if they keep annoying you with it because it qualifies sexual harassment after you've said no, in fact if it's nude/part nude that you're talking about, it's a crime for them to be asking in the first place because you're only 14.<br>  Keep to your morals and do what you feel is right.<br>  Decent guys don't do that.

Well, I hope you have more to back that up than just your baby's appearance, because otherwise you need serious mental help for your severe trust issues.<br>  <br>  Seriously, if you do not think it's yours, there has to be some OTHER reason for thinking that than just how the baby looks.

What's the REAL reason for suspecting your wife?|`|AA11138696	Cool your suspicions and take a look at the old family tree.  Traits often skip generations and the baby could look like great grandpa.   Also it does take some time for the skin color of babies to settle into what it will be.  Unless you have reason to be suspicious I would look beyond the conclusions you are jumping at.  Do you love your wife? Does she love you?  Do you love the baby?  Then what is your problem.  Stop looking for trouble and enjoy your new family.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	well when the baby born they still effected and might looks weired it's totally normal but then they will change, i don't think your wife cheating on you it just all baby looks wired when they born then they change by time, be a nice dad and trust your wife! good luck |`|pKzH1cFHaa	Both my parents are brunettes and one has brown eyes and one has hazel eyes.

dNssgc76aa	wow, that's kind of bizarre - you kind of just described what I'm going through. my boyfriend, (well, ex as of this last month :'[) is also very emotionally detatched. I think you just need to be loving and there for him - just be the best person you can be and support him, but don't expect him to change. He will change on his own will and time...I wish it was like that, where you could just magically help someone you love, but it really does just have to be their choice...but you can help with that in the process of it all by simply being there. goodluck xo|`|XMysS1Wuaa	He isn't broken.<br>  He's only hurt.<br>  If you remind him of that, you're only going to tear that more.<br>  Leave him be for a while; but sometime tell him you want to help.<br>  Don't throw yourself at him, because everybody needs space and everybody needs to learn on their own.<br>  But be there. Not in his hair, or always fight to be on his mind, just BE there. And sometime, he'll take that.|`|B6Z9POlwaa	You can't fix somebody. He needs time to experience life and learn things. Eventually he will become the person that he is meant to be. You can't rush that process. |`|74hxsPD4aa	it is impossible to fix someone, people who go into relationships with that idea always end up getting hurt<br>  you cannot make them change|`|JNx6xzqzaa	YOU CAN GIVE HIM AS MUCH SUPPORT AS HE NEEDS BUT THERES NO WAY YOU CAN FIX HIM HE HAVE 2 WANT THAT FOR HISSELF|`|ElcsJEngaa	Someone can only fix themselves. You can influence someone, but you cant get inside and make the decision for them.|`|AA10839619	No. Move on. you can still be friends, but you can't fix him.|`|osCkpdX7aa	what raven said.|`|90MpYwMnaa	You can't fix someone unless they want to be fixed.|`|OS19p6smaa	Like others said, he has to want to change. Being I don't know you both it is hard to answer. Sounds like there may be some depression involved.|`|01LoDk48aa	A guru would help, otherwise just let him do it himself.|`|rctPP4hlaa	Nope.  The best you can do is be supportive of the positive changes you see.  He has got to do the thinking and decision making for himself.  Otherwise, he really won't be "fixed".  <br>  <br>  There's a reason why the parents of babies cannot learn to walk for them... those babies have to fall down sometimes and learn from their mistakes.  If they choose to ignore what they've learned, they could be crawling for a long time.  But once they start to trust themselves to do what is right, they will walk on their own.<br>  <br>  Since it's a negative outlook that he's battling, he may have a difficult time getting back that positive outlook.  The human brain creates patterns.  <br>  <br>  These patterns are like someone who's been walking the snow.  At first, he'll notice he's making a little path, but eventually, he'll have walked this same path for so long, there are huge walls on either side of the path.  The difficult thing is taking or finding a different path, but it's not impossible.  <br>  <br>  Google this for more info:  "brain plasticity".|`|vHwG69g2aa	Ask yourself, can someone change who you are? <br>  Plus you dont change a man. Only he can determine to change himself.|`|ZRQvrbtGaa	You can try to help him, and push him in the right direction, but ultimately that's his battle he's gotta win alone. Unfortunate, it would be nice to just be able to "fix" people. I'd "fix" my ex to fall in love with me again, lol.|`|xWakbiIfaa	  He's going to want to do it...but you can be there with him.  The problem with trying to "fix" someone is that it can become manipulative and when somebody is being manipulated, things don't always go as planned.  <br>  <br>    So, you shouldn't try to fix him, but show your care and concern if he's willing to change his life and you both may benefit from it.|`|EVS5t31qaa	I wanted to answer this question because i thought you meant "fix" as in castrate.... u know... like with a cheese grater.<br>  <br>  Not that I would sneak into my ex-boyfriend's house and do that, or anything... really... no matter what the jury said... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But really, don't fix someone who doesn't want to be fixed. It's like giving someone surgery to make them healthier if they were opposed to it (for some reason). |`|GRXdbUdoaa	you can't fix anyone sweetie. he has to want to change. there is no other way. if you push him then he is just going to get even further away from you and other people.|`|U6NMoWdRaa	No guy, under any circumstances, wants to be 'fixed'.

PTyYSdxbaa	If you really want to find out be a mentor for her you need to be her friend first. Which means building trust, which won't happen if you're snooping. Just give it time, do things as sisters sometimes, bonding things, then she will slowly start to warm up to you. But you need to genuinely respect her privacy too and be real with her.  Realize that she may never want to open up to you and if she doesn't be prepared to stay out of her business. At that point if she's doing things inappropriate for a 12 yr old the parents should be involved. Good luck.|`|nM4OYgXSaa	when she isn't there, take her cell phone, and under the caller list, see if any of her boyfriends numbers are there, and call them pretending to be her and they might tell you their plans with your sister.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Where are your parents?<br>  This is their concern (hopefully), not yours.<br>  <br>  I believe you want to know so much because you are jealous of her.<br>  <br>  She is only 12, but you don't sound much older and definitely not mature.|`|7x6LP47Daa	dude it's none of your ******* bussiness.<br>  if her parents aren't doing anything, just let her find out for herslef.<br>  get the **** out of her bussiness.

mSa5on6Taa	I am sorry you are so depressed.  I too have felt as you feel now. I have fought with myself regarding self confidence.  Most people who know me would never guess how many times I cried myself to sleep during school.  I did however figure out a way to deal with it.  Try this:<br>  <br>  Act as if you had confidence. <br>  <br>  I have done this for a really long time now and people always think I have much more confidence than I have ever really had. I am in reality a very insecure person BUT when I am too nervous to do something I take a deep breath and say to myself, "okay, how would a really confident person act?" Then I go and do it pretending I am that very confident person. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps sweetie!<br>  <br>  |`|0gdBjXb1aa	i definately lack confidence...but...you'll find someone who will tell you that you are beautiful, smart and everything else you want to hear...just maybe now isn't the time.

Besides, you don't have to be dating your prom date. Do you have any close friends that are girls and single? Just go with a friend. It's not really a big deal.. I mean, when you look back on prom, would you rather have pictures of you and a friend that you can look back at and smile, or a quick fix of a girlfriend that you probably won't date for long and what bit of relationship you do have will be rocky and end with a horrible breakup? I mean, face it, it's high school. It's all around you, you shouldd know that by senior year.|`|AtPIRLBraa	mate. be patient. if all the things you stated are true, then those girls dont deserve you. the right one will come eventually. about the prom, have you got any friends who are girls? like, just as friends? if so, go with them. its better than going alone, and youll probably enjoy it more, than going with a girlfriend.|`|VXnQVnL4aa	your in high school it happens<br>  dont give a f*** about girls in high school<br>  <br>  let it go<br>  <br>  fyi tooooo nice guys are not soo attractive we need half manly /half sweety k hope it helps|`|0pNLiKSRaa	it is not your fault. those girls are just really dumb. nice guys do not finish last they get the best reward.|`|d4ab38bd65622d2cee9ecf2fd73f429daa	I went to my senior prom with my best friend. We had a lot of fun. If you want to go with a girl, ask someone to go with you as a friend, no pressure. If she's single (if she's not, make sure her boyfriend's okay with it), it might turn into something more. Friendship is always the best basis for a relationship. Don't just settle for anyone because you want a girlfriend. That will NOT work out in your best interest. I almost did that, and I would've gotten hurt really badly. <br>  You're about to go to college anyways. If you're moving (or if she is), that puts a huge strain on you guys. Do you really want to set yourself up for that? Plus, when you start college, a lot of things about you, like how you see the world and who you like to hang out with, are likely to change.<br>  If you see someone you think is really worth it, go for it. If not, go with a friend and wait for someone who is. She will come.
Z2NLFBOFaa	How about you put a wig on and dress yourself like a girl. I know a kid that dresses in drag. He did it once at school and eventually he had created his own little posse.

Maybe it's something she can change or maybe it was a misunderstanding. If it's unresolvable, then give your reasons and move on. Don't be mean, though, cause karma suxs and it'll come back to you. Good luck.|`|daff3bfa0e48a436ceb77d133a3fc15aaa	The best to tell your your bff that you don't want to be her friend is to just email her or call her. If possible then go in front of her and tell her some good reason why you don't want to be her friend.

If she says no- do not beat yourself up it happens, don't ask why/how come, just let it go. <br>  But you have to try and if that one says no, go for the next girl and if she says no; but need to evaluate how you may come across (don't be nervous-girls may laugh at you or dismiss u on the spot, so what); your approach/execution/delivery for her, bad hygiene/body odor- OMG, gross if the guy smells or has way too much cologne/body spray that he could burn up in an instant if you lit a match- he will be dismissed same goes with bad breathe either someone farted in your mouth or smells like garbage/cigs- you might as well just walk away until you clean up your act.<br>  Tag or other body sprays/cologne after a shower spray yourself a little on your neck and body, use deodorant, baby powder or whatever, w/o b4 u put on your clothes make sure they're clean and a little spritz on them give them a little time to air out and then put on.

I believe whatever you think is best - you known each other for a month and if you don't get him something that great - its the thought that counts.  It's way different if you've been dated over a year, maybe a nice gift or handmade gift would be good. A birthday card would be good enough. Spending time with him with for lunch or dinner - a birthday person should feel special enough celebrating to be another year older. |`|arCzWJdyaa	Try to crack the case on what he wants for his birthday.

Have a few drinks then go over and see how you respond to a "hi, how ya doin?" then if everything went well, we'd continue talking. If you were a B&*^( about it then I would go have a seat again, and wait for another girl.|`|HMMRVK4vaa	i would stare back at her and smile then start a conversation and eventually give her MY number..............(WiLL YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION ABOUT RATING ME!!)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (\ _ /)<br>  (='.'=) Copy and paste this Bunny<br>  ('')_('') into your profile to help him gain<br>  world domination<br>  |`|Vb0a94KVaa	Well, me personally I would state right back...an no I wouldn't <br>  Think it's wierd...

f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	IS WHAT OK? YOU BEING A LIAR? ASK YOURSELF. IM NOT GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	i agree with keith. he's too controlling.|`|I8rnOqyeaa	As long as your chats are innocent its ok, he is an important friend to you who's been in your life for a while.<br>  It might be ok to keep it a secret, but you might want to ask yourself how important your bf is to you? Like do you think he could be your partner for life? If you answer yes, definitely to that question, then there are sometimes sacrifices you have to make to create an honest, trusting relationship.<br>  On the other hand, your bf needs to get over his jealousy sometime, especially if the jealousy has come up for no reason (i.e. you've only ever been friends with your guy friend and nothing more).<br>  But there are times in life when lieing is the best option, they're called "white lies". And it can be when you don't tell the whole truth for a good reason, in this case its to not upset your boyfriend. So don't feel too guilty because your "lies" can be for the greater good.|`|PQBEqS8Caa	I think u need to sit and talk to ur bf and evaluate why he is feeling like this. If he is insecure, u should reassure him and tell him that u love him but u friendship is very important to u. <br>  <br>  Its the same with me and my bf but with situatons reversed. Theres this girl I hate thats my bf's very good frnd. We have taken a stand and my bf says he cannot just stop being frnds with her. So, i told him that ok u can be frnds with her but dont ever talk to her abt me, i dont wanna be around her, etc. So thats that!<br>  I dont hear her name anymore and we are fine. <br>  So, if u bf does not want to hear his name, so dont tell ur bf as far as u r just chatting to the dude. |`|9f76528c25ee8989980872c5f0d0892caa	um you should tellhim the truth.<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoPsD6TJeEZwFsct7NagANHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081106182221AAx51lA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|e0Qvdg0zaa	It shouldnt matter if you talk to your friend. |`|db0778827116a58f89a08caf6b15fd95aa	your bf does not own you and cannot tell you who you can and cannot talk to. ignore him...well <br>  tell him that this is how it is,<br>  <br>  1-he's ur friend and has been for longer than u 2 have been dating and it isnt changing <br>  <br>  2- ur bf cant pick ur friends for you, and if he thinks he can then he should leave. you could get a better not over jealous bf <br>  <br>  |`|Swxir2ieaa	No, because if your boyfriend ends up finding out that you really are still talking to him he is going to get even madder. Then your boyfriend is going to assume that you have a reason to hide why you are talking to your friend and that you could be cheating on him.|`|ufNBdlqbaa	nope, not ok. You lied to him, and that means ur r not a couple. Couples are about trust and u dont trust him anough to tell him that u cant stop talkinto this guy.........Is it really worth losing ur bf , 4 a guy that u just talk to on msn?think bout it|`|W8XShSnzaa	no its not ok. communication is the basis of any good relationship. why does your bf hate him so? i say you need to tell the truth and if it makes your bf more comfortable then maybe you should stop chatin with the other guy|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	one lie leads to another.  why not find a bf who doesn't give a hoot who you talk to??  This way, you'll stop being a liar  and have a bf who cares less about you and your doings.|`|ufCO60Osaa	No it's not worth the hassle if you love your boyfriend you wouldn't want to hurt him how would you feel if the tables were turned?<br>   You will get found out sooner or later so choose carefully before you get yourself in too deep.|`|YkZm5VWhaa	Friends are difficult enough to find, bfs are everywhere.|`|g0q6ny9qaa	no I hope you aren't doing anything with him.|`|FGmmPkpGaa	If you have feelings for this other guy, you need to tell him.  If you don't have feelings for this other guy, you need to tell him.  My girlfriend has guy friends who she hangs out with all the time and I have no problem with it...... most of the time.  I don't like it when she talks or hangs out with others that I know like her or flirt with her.  I realize that you can't control what others think about you, but you can control what you think about them.  Some guys just act ridiculous when they are jealous.  Tell him exactly how you feel, but only if you mean it.  If he can't except your true feelings and beliefs, then get the relationship over with.|`|Chib4b8saa	Honesty is always the best policy. This is a difficult situation though, because to you, you're not doing anything wrong. I mean, this other guy has been your best friend for 5 years, and you've only been with your boyfriend for 3. I don't see any harm in talking with your friend. I don't understand why guys have such a problem with this. My husband found out I was talking to his cousin via email and blew up about it. I mean, it was totally innocent on my part, but not to him. I finally had to just explain it to his cousin why I could no longer keep in touch with him. I wasn't going to put my marriage at risk. So I guess you either have to tell your boyfriend the truth and tell him it's totally innocent and ask him if he would have a problem if it was a girl you were talking to. When he says no to that, then ask him what the difference is. A friend is a friend, regardless of their sex. Good luck.|`|z1ZcVnEoaa	Well, I always saying lying is not okay but I do the same thing.  My bf told me he would rather not know that I am talking to my guy friends.  I would never cheat on him and he knows that.  He just said that to him it is like a slap in the face that I am talking to another guy.  So if you know you are doing nothing wrong and just talking as friends then I guess a "white" lie is okay.  I mean it is better than getting yelled at all the time.  I will say though that if he ever catches you in that lie he is going to wonder why you have been lying :).  |`|pvnDQsoEaa	Boyfriends come and go but friends stay forever. Make sure your conversations are appropriate and wont disrespect the relationship you have with your boyfriend. However its always good to have friends separate from your boyfriend and he doesn't needs to know everything you do so I don't think its bad that he doesn't know.|`|jOgfzQw0aa	you shouldnt have to choose between your friend and bf.<br>  <br>  tell your bf that you are still in touch with this guy& that your just friends.<br>  your bf is jealous because of the relationship you have with this other guy. reasure your bf that he is the only one for you and you wouldnt be with him otherwise!<br>  <br>  dont lie to your bf! be honest! if theres nothing to hide in your friendship with this other guy then why should u feel guilty!? youl only make yourself feel worse if you associate your male friend with the feeling of guilt!|`|AA10472805	just keep talking to him my ex boyfriend got mad every time i talked to my friend he said that hes just gonna go kick his *** if he tries to take his gf away. you don't have to feel bad about lying i did it because my friend went into the armed forces and i wrote him letters all of the time. don't stop being friends with him....you need friends in your life.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Nope, not ok. Lying is never a good thing.   If there's nothing going on with the other guy you should be able to tell your boyfriend who you're talking to.  You might think you are just protecting his feelings but the two of you need to be honest with each other if your relationship is going to last.  |`|7d1d3a67ed94d62c7e9452fca04ffb05aa	This is fine no-one has the right to tell you who and who not to talk to whatever  the situation so carry on and if he does find out then be honest and say you lied to stop you two fighting over a stupid message on IM and about someone you have been friends with for 5 years so ?|`|BJWhYYGkaa	Well do you say anything to this best friend that gives your bf a REASON to be upset?  If not then show him that and say I love you, he's a friend.  And if he can't see past it after too long, then maybe he needs to sort some trust issues out.|`|iTVoXWjxaa	dont be a fool.  keep talking with rly, but tell him, hes just a friend and if he gets jealous, he's not worth of being your bf.|`|G13DBUcUaa	You should just tell your boyfriend that you are going to keep talking to your guy friend instead of lying about it. He shouldn't be jealous. You are allowed to have other guy friends. |`|IZnst05Raa	yeah, you are allowed to talk to whoever you want. he doesnt need to know EVERYTHING. <br>  <br>  please answer my question?|`|LLZudX93aa	you're bg is the jealous type.  if he can't handle you chatting... well it only goes down hill from there.|`|74TfquIGaa	 Keith is wright|`|I1wHgJAwaa	seems like your boyfriend is jealous|`|DWJxUplAaa	tel him he is ur frnd if he has a prblm he isnt worth u he shud trust tht u wudnt cheat on him |`|9dwcszPMaa	No itz not ok
6c1339b6a5310be6301873ad6f7637b9aa	Thank goodness you have decided to avoid America's Next Top Model. It's a good source of entertainment, but not really a good career path for someone that wants to model.<br>  <br>  The winners and contestants of America's Next Top Model are not held in high regard in the fashion industry. Several former contestants have talked about how it closes doors for them.<br>  <br>  You need an agency. You're in New York, so you have lots of options. You do *not* need a full portfolio to be considered. Most fashion agencies will want only simple Polaroid-style snapshots.<br>  <br>  Every agency has a preference on how you should submit to them.  Some have open calls.  Some take email submissions.  The first thing is to find out what a particular agency prefers, and give them that.  Virtually all agencies will take regular postal submissions.<br>  <br>  If the agency has open calls, or allows models to personally drop off pictures, do that if possible.  Pictures are good, but seeing you in person is better.  There are lots of examples of people who would have been turned down from their pictures, but who were accepted when somebody actually laid eyes on them in person.<br>  <br>  If you don’t live where they are, or the agency won’t accept walk-ins, the best thing to do is sent them a postal mail application.  If you want to get the pictures back, include a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Make sure you write your name, contact information and stats on the back of every picture so if it gets separated from the cover letter they can still tell who you are.<br>  <br>  Fashionmodeldirectory.com has a list of agencies in New York.|`|ERVib5gYaa	Get noticed, get an agent, apply to an agency..<br>  You needn't bother with creating a portfolio, they help you all that stuff. Most people who where founded didnt have a load of pictures in a file of them..<br>  Look for an agency, go on their website and some like storm.. you can send your pictures to them|`|bXGwTQy6aa	you need to put a portfolio together and attend all the casting sessions you can possibly find...

4cda3fbcf47a67dc357a025a36e01e20aa	even know your shy you have to go talk to her and make her laugh you have to show her that your not shy around her and that you feel comfortable around her it will work trust me

But if he's been looking at you alot. He proberbly likes you and wanted you to notice him
iyRWN59Xaa	He sounds controlling.  You're right.  If it doesn't work out, you're screwed.  I think it's only fair if you want to work, you can.  What about a part-time job?  The money you earn can compensate for child care.  Tell him to stop being so controlling.  If he continues to do so, you may need to seek marriage counseling.|`|4POGapREaa	You can't just LET him control everything.  Tell him that if you're not "allowed" to work then you want all the money back in your joint account & you also want your name added to Title on the house.  Period.  |`|h6NqNzHAaa	If you are planning to divorce him in the future then check out the laws in your state regarding distribution of assets in a divorce.<br>  <br>  If you don't see a divorce in the future then quick complaining about having a wonderful provider and the opportunity to raise your children. |`|5OGBneHLaa	I am sure your husband loves you and that he is a great provider.  He is also a CONTROL FREAK.  Why do you have separate accounts?  Why do you have to ask him permission to get a job?  He is your partner not your father.  It is normal to have these feelings, you dont want to wake up one day and have no choices or not know what to do.<br>  <br>  You are not selfish, you are seeing a pattern.  My little sister lived the same life. Then her husband threw her out.  She couldnt even take her kids with her, she had no job, no skills and no way to defend herself.  Her name was on nothing and had no rights to anything.<br>  <br>  I am not saying it will happen to you, just be smart about it.|`|7OTJW7fAaa	You should be worried about your future.  You are not selfish.  You need to talk to a lawyer.  Your husband is a control freak who will never allow you any personal or financial freedom.  Everything that you share in your marriage should be both of yours.  Your name should be on the house title, the card title, bank accounts, everything.  This man has stolen everything from you by putting it all in his name.  You play the role of the free nanny and housekeeper.  <br>  <br>  Remember that unconditional love means that your husband should want for you what you want for yourself.  He doesn't feel this way.  He wants for you what he decides on and what he controls.  This is not love and marriage.  This is imprisonment.  <br>  <br>  Consult a lawyer and break free from this man.  Don't raise your children in this restrictive atmosphere.|`|AA11993638	First of all he is acting controlling by switching the funds into his personal account, granted I can somewhat see his reasoning for not wanting you to work at this time, but his attitude about it is a little off. See if he would be willing to allow you to take some online classes so that when the baby is old enough you at least have something to apply toward a job. On the plus side, if the worst would happen, there are programs that would assist you in career development. I have noticed that a man who wants total control of the money situation is not actually taking care of things, what would happen if he were in an accident and you needed to access the account? |`|jgYhKaACaa	I was in the exact same situation. I told my husband that his attitude makes me feel unsecured and the kids were top priority and if he didn't start doing some things to make me feel more secure then I was getting a job so I could have something called mine.<br>  my husband still has his own bank account and I have mine, but everything is ours and this way he feels more in control of the money he earns. (had a bad childhood)<br>  maybe you can get the baby into headstart if your in the US and that will help with daycare costs. maybe find out why he feels the way he does and communicate about how serious you are about your emotions.<br>  I hope this helps and things work out, it didn't work that well for me, I ended up going to college after several tries of getting something decent and now I am working at a job that works well for everyone. but I was unsure while this was going on and how it work out but things did. and I hope it does for you! :)|`|zLZYuYcVaa	No, you are not being selfish.  And no, you should not "just let it go".  It doesn't sound like he's thinking of you at all - only himself.  You guys won't get very far if he doesn't stop being so selfish and controlling.  Sit him down and tell him exactly how you feel.  You have every right to be heard and respected... especially by your HUSBAND.|`|AbPb0C7eaa	Confront him like this: if something terrible were to happen in which you died or we had to seperate, I want to be able to have my fair share. If he goes, why would we ever seperate? You could say.. well, you're showing the early signs of an abuser and it's scaring me. |`|yIbXM74Caa	No of course not. In fact he is the one being selfish. He needs to realize that you both are a team, you share everything. But dont worry because if you both split u get 1/2 of his earnings. |`|0LBRPVOqaa	i think he is a control freak!!<br>  you are partners and everything should be shared between the two of you.|`|VVtr54Myaa	Your husband sounds controlling dear. |`|fE4Uwsyeaa	Unfortunately, I haven't ever been in that type of situation but I don't thing there should be any reason why you can't get a job.  If you have a job you could pay for the daycare and he wouldn't have anything to worry about.  I would talk to him about it and tell him that it's not that he doesn't take care of you because he does and he's a wonderful provider but you'd like to get out there and get into the world.  You want to have extra money in case of emergencies or just to have for extra stuff you want around the house.|`|hrW8qEqlaa	ME PERSONALLY...I WOULD HAVE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH MY SPOUSE BEFORE I GOT MARRIED. I HAD MY FIRST JOB WHEN I WAS 12 SHOVELING SNOW AND NOW IM 20 YRS OLD WITH 2 JOBS AND ATTENDING COLLEGE. IVE ALWAYS EARNED MY OWN MONEY. MAYBE IF YOU TELL YOUR SPOUSE THAT YOU WILL PAY FOR DAYCARE. I THINK THAT IT IS UNFAIR THAT HE IS GETTING EVERYTHING IN HIS NAME. DOES HE GIVE YOU ANY MONEY AT ALL? THINK ABOUT THAT. YOU HAVE AS MUCH AS A RIGHT TO WORK AS HE DOES!!!

gRuN7EChaa	there is no right answer, such perceived time scale or notion of marriage is a socially constructed ideal. You have your unique life, if you enjoyed loving her as much as you loved her, then choose to do so again and you will find again. Have faith and don't let the nature of the beast get you down, doubts and fears goes hand in hand with life.<br>   If you had broken up 10 years from now, you could have ended up a single parent.... Just follow your unique path and be true to your self and be open to life.|`|JGiGT14Paa	You've got your whole life ahead of you. Enjoy this time as you and do things you would want to do and be who you are. And when the time is right, the right girl will come and she'll sweep you off your feet. There's always hope. Don't lose hope...because without hope, and without love, we are nothing. You will meet someone who you will love truly and then you'll wonder how you could possibly love her as much as you will.<br>  Enjoy this time...and learn to be you. Don't rush into things...you'll know when you meet her.|`|kngZ5o3Naa	i met the love of my life when i was 28 we are now married with two lovely boys|`|5fa7d4914670da7cc20b02a64e6f1b7daa	I'm sorry man, trust me, we all have those times in our lives that we feel we may never have someone special ever again. The truth is that you just have to treat the next girl as if she's your first true love all over again and someday she might end up being the one.<br>  You're only 22 after all, you have at least 8 years to find that special person before you start getting old.|`|hHndD5SEaa	of course you will - and you might find it hard to believe now, but you'll be delighted that things didnt work out with this girl when you're with a woman even better than her!<br>  You're still quite young - you have loads of time to meet another lady!<br>  xx

Start by licking round the tip of the head and kissing it.  Then lick up the shaft and then down, putting some pressure on. As you come up putthe penis in your mouth and bob your head up and down, increasing the speed and pressure. Listen out for what he likes by the change of his breathing.  Or leave the foreskin as it is, put your mouth on the foreskin at the top of the penis and use that to go up and down with, as if you were tossing him off, but with your mouth. Keep licking and kissing aswell.<br>  <br>  Its pretty simple, easy to do.  Thats what i do anyways, i take a break now and then to go and kiss him, and then kiss his chest and neck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helped! :D|`|VrJ0H6OGaa	haha<br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect!|`|GmWIDDRQaa	if you're asking this online then you're probably too young to be doing this... if you are old enough and are just inexperienced then my only advice is just to go with your instincts... most guys like just about anything to some extent, but all guys have different things they like better... you'll be able to tell when your guy is enjoying more than other times and just go with that.|`|CKX0A8oWaa	Don't worry you can't really screw it up unless you accidentally clip him with your teeth.

You know, for teen parents, that you can get involved with and then you can find new friends that you can hang out with along with the kids. You can talk about your good and bad times so far about being parents and maybe give each other tips on what you did to get yourselves and your child through rough times, ie feedings, diaper rashes etc.<br>  Talk to your doctor/ pediatrician about teen parenting classes and try to make new friends.

She hardly sees her single friends any more and started hanging out with those friends who already have their own children.<br>  <br>  another example is with me. I have single friends and friends in relationships (I am single btw). I noticed that the amount of time I am hanging out with friends in relationships decreased ever since they started going out. <br>  <br>  Back to your friends. They were jerks that they went to the party and didn't let you know about it. I would honestly have a heart-to-heart chat with them telling them that this hurt your feelings. They might be jealous because you have a kid and they want one too. <br>  <br>  "I really want to go out with my friends but I cant as I got a baby and its getting me down so much. "<br>  <br>  That phrase is concerning. I am afraid you might start blaming your child because she limited your abilities to have friends.Your friends are adults. they should be mature enough to act properly (I still cannot believe that they bailed out on you - what kind of friends do that?! They could at least called). |`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, your friends have got there life to live.you were silly with your by having a baby.you were not ready to have a child,you should be out enjoying yourself.its a shame you can't do that.but i will give you credit you could have left her,and gone out with your mates,but you have not.can't your family look after the baby while you have a night out. how old or you?would one of your friends mum/sister baby sit one night a week for you.i feel so sorry for you,you need a break from the baby.ask around your mates.xx|`|AA11015890	That's such a shame.  Frankly, they suck as friends!  Can you try and <br>   make friends with other young mums at mother and baby group, or even the baby clinic?  I know you're only young and might be worried that other mums will look down on you, but it could be worth a go.  <br>  <br>  You need to look after your emotional health at such a vulnerable time in your life, and it isn't good to never be able to take care of your own needs.  Talk to your health visitor about this and see if she knows of any other teenage mums, or some kind of activity/group you can go to.

029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	Guys like that have a way of making girls very insecure. They treat you badly but you want to make them treat you well - it's a never-ending battle that few actually win. The guy is clearly not worthy of your time, and now that he's back in the picture you want to know if he's still into you. Don't even think about it again. You're much better off with the new guy, and let me tell you something: if for 3 years the relationship was "bad for the most part," you're not missing anything.|`|7iMZ91K7aa	girl, girl, girl... Oh how I have been there! I feel for you because I was the same way with my ex. We didn't have a nasty break up, but we didn't end to well either.. I went for months and didn't talk to him or anything, then one day I just started thinking about him, just little things, like the cute names we had for each other and things we use to do together.. And I also had a GREAT GUY in my life that would of seriously been everything I had EVER wanted in life, very cute, he was a Marine, good christian faith, had all the same goals and everything I had, wanted marriage and kids just like me right away... But something was missing.. and it was my ex, I couldn't stop thinking about him. He had called me a few times and I was really rude to him and ignored his phone calls, but one day I called him and we talked for awhile, then we realized we wanted to give it another shot. Now our two year wedding anniversary is a week away and I love him more than anything! So my advice to you would be just talk to your ex, you could talk to him and tell him how you feel, then realize how wrong you were, or realize you cant live without him and wind up getting married and having three kids! But don't ever live with the regret of "what if". Theres nothing wrong with talking to him! Good luck!|`|hp7bjwRZaa	don't be daft. Stay with the new guy! and if you like the new guy you should stop talking to your ex  or at least let your new dude know about it (if he doesn't already). The only reason your hung up on that old douchebag is because he provides you with familiarity. But if you stay with the new dude long enough, that will be replaced.. good luck!|`|yrNc73Vdaa	 Ask yourself if you love/want to be with your current bf because hes the stereotype of what a good bf should be or because you as a person like his personality|`|c2uEs18eaa	Realise what you just said. You have moved on, he is gaining weight and developing dependencies. Including one on you. RUN.<br>  You were torn, and scarred, by what you had with him. You have grown as a person, he hasnt... and you still are affected by the feelings of guilt or insecurity over him. Do not let him ruin what you have now, chances are he either blames you for his downfall or feels if he had you back he would be OK again. Neither is true - addicts are their own worst enemies, but drag down those closest to them, too. So do not be that close.|`|gyJ6DVRkaa	Maybe you should look at this as a test of GOD, if you believe in him.  Maybe you have found the one.  As you stated "I have now been with a guy for 7 months who treats me like a princess."  It is up to you to pass on temptation and to grab on to what you deserve.  You are being tested, I hope you pass the test.  Good Luck!  God Bless You.|`|Zs08YQn1aa	You probably miss being with him. When I talk to my ex now and he talks about his new girlfriend and how hot she is and everything I just wanna hang up, enenthough I have a boyfriend I kinda miss being with him.|`|i5eRbowxaa	right now im going through da exact same thing thinking about my ex while im with da new guy, but to tell u da truth u cant avoid thinking of the person u care about and i dont know why we put all our energy and focuse onto da person dat doesnt deserve it, what really helps me is just looking at my man and just feeling happy and thinking dat with my ex i wasnt, honestly u shouldnt waste ur time even talking to ur ex dats why u still hooked. i changed my # ok cause i really want to be happy with my man now, u should focuse on what u have and da happiness u have and deserve trust me once u get that in ur head u will feel so much better, just get away from ur ex 4 a while and spend all the time u can with ur new man u will see u will feel so much better, i did.
T9m0YQgFaa	i would admire his honesty ad trust that he had changed.|`|AA10720479	Not at all, good for you sweetie. P.S. It would make me want you more:)|`|WtljrYZpaa	No, I would be grateful for his honesty|`|4llptkFfaa	Expect it to be a bit of a shock to her. But it should not matter in a bad way. Shes been dating you for a year, she obviously likes you alot- she should be able to recognise that you've done something incredible by changing your life. She might also be a bit shocked that you hadn't told her before, but again, as youve been dating that long, she should recognise that youve told her this far in for your own reasons. Just tell her the truth and she should understand. Everyone makes mistakes however big or small :)|`|zS7bOjn4aa	It would shock me and it may take me a few days to get over it but I would admire the honesty and clearly the trust if the guy felt he could tell me something like that.<br>  I would be worried he would slip back into his old ways though.|`|n7noPV7Aaa	no because he overcame it. and if you love him you will help him overcome it again if need be.|`|4e2661a92d7758c0a5f88124fe4e764caa	It would matter, but in a good way.|`|DN2jwOloaa	I would be shocked and be like err...but if i really cared about him that much i would be really proud that he could turn his life around, it would show that he had the strength to do something really hard like that. It would also share he was caring if he was willing to help people..sounds like hes become a good person! i would stay with him xxx|`|LDclBL7oaa	The only thing that would matter to me was the 'found God' bit - slightly off putting comment i'd say.|`|SjTMc5ULaa	No.  I would be happy that he'd turned his life around.

You shouldn't be sleeping with married men. They had a life,  and dreams befor you ever came around.|`|P544Sbmqaa	There isnt really anything that she can do to you legally.  Actually, YOU should be the one filling a case against him for child support.<br>  <br>  Next time, think twice before getting involved with a married man.|`|oqX0PwQiaa	She can't do anything to you legally. You need to file for child support for your baby. You are going to have to give him visitation rights and she will be with your child when he has visitation. |`|yVIb7zjiaa	What kind of case can the wife file against you??She can't do s_hit to you..She needs to file a case against her sorry @ss husband..|`|UMl7CBCIaa	how many men are going to give up the wife. After dipping else where.|`|IrrNqlszaa	She can't do anything to you besides it takes two, I dont approve of the fact that you were sleeping with a married man however its not entirely your fault. The best thing you can do is take him for child support, that baby is still his responsibility regardless of what happend between the two of you. |`|Ff7mCzlPaa	His wife can't file any case against you.... <br>  <br>  She ought to kick her husband to the curb for cheating, however.<br>  <br>  YOU CAN file for child support through the court.  It doesn't matter whether or not the man's name is on the birth certificate.  The child is still entitled to child support, and there are ways to prove he's the father (blood tests).<br>  |`|bpjpD7W3aa	give the baby to 2 rich parents who will love it, <br>  mabey she sue you for alienation of affection<br>  or if they have money they can take the child from you in court,<br>  he CAN  sue for custody you know.

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	You can run from you problems all you want.  They always catch up eventually again.  I would say not to run away, but to keep on trucking.  It sounds like you are having a tough time...but time heals all wounds.  Running away will be of no help to you.  At 21 I was still having trouble learning the ins and outs of life, bills, college, and the military.  It just took time for me to live with the tough stuff, and learn how to cope and deal with things I had troubles with.  Remember tough things don't happen to tough people...tough people persevere.  I would suggest staying where you are.  I'm guessing you have a roof over your head, food on the table, and your getting by.  Wait until you are an adult to go see the world and start YOUR life.  Also talk to your Mom...I guarantee she would be more then willing to listen and help as best she can.  Good luck, and I hope you have sunnier days.|`|FyJSxmFraa	I suggest you go to sleep. Quit getting high. Leave your dog alone. Just because you live at home is not the reason you have no life. Why run away? save your money, then move out like a normal person. 
WyaWCz2aaa	i think he may think your kinda avoiding the question of asking him out, because he definatly likes you the flirting with another girl is just to get you jealous and the not talking to you means he is shy around you allot of the time.<br>  <br>  guys prefer it if you make them feel wanted so i would just come out and say do you wanna come with some of my mates and me to the movies on the weekend and dont worry there will be another guy there.<br>  <br>  guys who like you prefer the idea of being asked out and having it sound like a date... good luck<br>  <br>  plz help me<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhpfWI2nhrSDAVm2JGVsOKnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081107144844AAIi7nk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|d08rkYlpaa	That does sound like a good idea. Just don't put too much weight on this event - if he doesn't know it's a date but you treat it like one, he might feel some unfairness.|`|NOnSX0xiaa	yeah go for it!<br>  what is the worst thing than can happen?<br>  i think he will appreciate your "courage" or confidence and accept your invitation :)|`|ZArYUIMcaa	of course girl! lol u should definatly go for it..and its a friendly date...perfect for a first date =)|`|U1p8tHYBaa	Ya i have a friend like that, and yes, i think u shud ask him but id word it differently, id say something like "Hey, a couple of my friends and I are goin to the movies Saturday, but only one has a boyfriend and he doesnt wanna be the only guy, you wanna come?"  I think that would make it sound less awkward, if all ur trying to do is see his reaction.|`|WPt9bivgaa	It sounds like a date because the guy/girl ratio, your asking him to bring a friend, that would make it a triple date. Lol. I would just ask what he's doing Saturday night and if hes not doing anything, I'd say, "Hey, do you want to come hang out and watch a movie with my friends? We're probably going to see blah blah blah and get something to eat or go blah blah blah right after, what do you say, you could even bring a friend."|`|D4RBT5kCaa	Don't be so specific with your question. Does he Know the other people who are going to be there? If so, just ask him if he'd like to come over and catch a movie with Bob, Jane and Buffy.<br>  If he says YES then that is a very good sign, especially if he doesn't know the other people that well. Good Luck!|`|bTGWxf6raa	That sounds like something I would do <br>  Just go for it and good luck (:|`|zABGs4nTaa	great idea|`|pmsqHs8aaa	Ask him out!

Ask the dude out, believe me, i would be flattered and have always been when a female has asked me out. Its the greatest compliment to young mans ego and if you are truly into him then you'd be able to find out sooner than later if he really likes you or the "other girl". Besides you don't want to be the second choice. Ask him out and put a double date emphasis on it and see what he does.|`|PVj4Osn2aa	well its weird for the girl to ask a guy out to the movies...just bring it up be like me and my friends are going out to the movies saturday night what are your plans... and he might just ask if he can go also,i think the guy should ask the girl at all times.|`|coqbBCh9aa	ya you should totally do that!<br>  you also have the crush with you and it wont be like a date.<br>  oh and dont bring that other friend he flirts with then thats just gonna ruin everything!<br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  and most of all have fun!|`|aK6HBviRaa	i think that sounds like a good idea because it doesn't pressure him too much cause it doesn't sound that date-ish if you know what I mean.<br>  feel free to email me if you have anymore Q's<br>  rebeccakost@yahoo.com|`|GfznrMiAaa	i say go ahead if you dont you might be missing out on somthin great i waited to long for a girl by the time i asked she liked some one else sucks cause she liked me befor too|`|jzOSfXmFaa	thats an awesome idea!!! goodluck!|`|kDjILe6Taa	Aye sounds good. Go for it lass ;)|`|sRqNJmpVaa	Sounds like a plan to me! Go for it! =)|`|yK4uQpTvaa	ok|`|BwGlxjx6aa	ive been in this situation, heres exactly what to say: "hey, wanna go to the movies with me and some friends on saturday? if your not busy, oh and feel free to bring a friend if you want"<br>  <br>  and if you dont have alot of time to ask him or whatever a good trick is to act like you ahve someting to do and you just asked him nonchalantly, <br>  <br>  be like  "oh hey, i wanted to ask you, u doing anything saturday? cause you should come with us to the movies, you can bring a friend if you want, lemme kno if you want to! k bye" and go walk off to do whatever-- this trick works better if you actualy do have soemthing to do, and it give the guy the chance to think about it, and to not be right on the spot<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|D5JCLssDaa	Great! Go for it! That's really taking charge and grabbing the bull by the horns. You will have a competitive advantage over most females that sit by the phone, staring at it, waiting for your dream boy to call you. You don't waste time. You like the guy so why not give him a call and ask him out while he is still thinking about what to do. Good for you, sister.<br>  Now, I am not sure what your age is. My suggestion would really depend on that. If this is your first date and you are in high school or junior high, you might want to go in a group. If you are high school or older, it might be better to take him some place where the two of you can be together without all these other people around. Just a suggestion.|`|pXDmFr43aa	your way over thinking this. Men or boys are pretty simple... You ask we answer. If he's interested in it he goes. Just don't lead him on if you don't want that, if it's not a date and you want to be just friends that state that up front. If you want him to be interested in you romantically don't mention the part about not being a date. I wouldn't come out and call it a date though, let him wonder. It will peak his interest. The part about the other girl isn't important to a confidant young lady.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Definitely a good idea(:  That's a perfect opportunity because he probably won't feel awkward at all.|`|xO2fDqklaa	that sounds good. If he says yes then thats a great sign. Dont be discouraged though if he has something else and says maybe another time.

YAMlze5Uaa	Well to be honest you've got to look at it this way, it's a four year friendship you have had with this person. But they lied and broke your trust, they are telling you they are 2 years younger than you, can you really believe this though? Because what will it be another 2 years go by and he'll explain he's about 15 years older than you? Just be really careful though. I don't see harm in making friends online etc as long as it doesn't progress to the meeting stage etc where you have to be extremely careful. Do let this person know that it's difficult to think of them as the same person because they have lied to you therefore broken your trust.<br>  Good luck and I hope things go well|`|iDYuSAynaa	It's very possible to relate to someone who's 2 years younger than you. My best friend is 2 years younger than me. You should appreciate the fact that he was finally truthful. He probably just wanted you to accept him at first. <br>  <br>  I however, strongly disagree with making close friends online, because you will never REALLY know them. It's quite dangerous. |`|EZyHOht7aa	I think there always comes a risk with long-distance relationships, whether it invovles friendship, or dating.<br>  <br>  I understand how some people find it difficult to make friends in real life, but maybe by talking to someone online your age who lives nearby, and actually spending facetime with them, that way your not being taken advantage of.|`|Ze9KepaWaa	He probably said this with fear of rejection for this very reason. It does matter a lot physiologically to know the most we possibly can about someone we have become friends with online, where you know nothing about them. Now that you know he lied, you feel like you have nothing to link him to yourself. But if you two related just fine before, this shouldn't get in the way of a good friendship. |`|7aa811d41efd8b148b1813352fd326f3aa	i think it was an odd thing for him to lie about, and i think it is an odd thing for you to be upset about, i find this whole thing to be a little odd....|`|3BW6my5jaa	well if you cant trust him no more than well becarful or the next thing he will say is he is really a girl omgawd thats creepy well hoped i helped|`|179oQ21Maa	Age might not matter soooo much, but it was still a lie.I think it was dumb to wait until 4 years for him to tell you this, but isn't he still a good friend? Hasn't he helped you out alot? If he told you 1 lie there's bound to be another. (sorry.) I suggest not "hanging out" with him as much anymore. I'm the kind of person who really hates lies. That wasn't a white lie either. |`|ChmuSKpVaa	i think you should try to forgive him, while he should have told you the truth to begin with, he may have lied because he thought you would not want to get to know him if you knew that he was younger than you. good luck! hope i helped|`|33387f0312b6f8eacc02d0ce050b7096aa	That was no real friendship anyway, so forgive him. <br>  I think that you can`t call a person who you have never seen in your life a 'friend'.

8rbQBaIeaa	I'll just say this..... You should have had this taken up on the time of the divorce. You will have to call a lawyer in your area to see what the fees are. I don't know about spousal support. My sister has spousal support because she did not work during the marriage. The only question I have is this. Does hubby pay you each and every month on your child support money? If he does, why ask for more money. I don't know what he makes, but I can tell you from my son that with him paying child support he cannot afford a bottle of water extra. Why couldn't you work, let the ex try to keep a roof over his head? If you cannot afford to take care of the children, then hubby may need to help you by taking them more while you and he both work. Sometimes I am not for sure bitter exes care if they take the ex's last dime as long as they are punished. They are punished more than you realize...they pay the mom all of this money, yet they don't have the luxury of being with their children more than x amount of time a month. Not fair in my opinion. The good dads who pay for their children should be honored, not begrudged.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	So you admit that you cannot financially support your children, let alone yourself at this point in your life, but yet you don't have the moral fortitude to allow your children to go live with the parent who can provide these things for them.<br>  <br>  If you take this in front of a judge trying to get money, your ex will hopefully have an attorney that will counter your suit for a modification based upon your circumstances since you don't seem to see past your own selfishness and pride and look out for the best interest of your children, which from your own words I draw this conclusion, is to be with their dad.<br>  <br>  |`|xFEuN9Vhaa	Being married to someone for 10 years does not guarantee you alimony.  The court will award alimony until the woman can get on her feet and get a job to take over the payments of the bills she acquired.  But not in every case.  This should have been address when you guys entered the final orders and filed the final decree.<br>  <br>  The child support is a math formula used to calculate your husbands earnings to determine what he can or should pay. <br>  <br>  Be very thankful that he is paying anything, many, many dead beat dads out there. |`|XqfH76PMaa	The best thing to do is to call around to local lawyers.

This is not a good combination, and I understand your concerns. He may not even be stressed over it, but the lack of exercise can be an important variable. <br>  <br>  You might try getting him to take a vitamin B complex (Stress Tablets) as they have a beneficial relaxing effect. Also, see if he would take a evening snack around 10pm or so. Toast and milk in combination can activate a substance in the brain called L Tryptophan which helps induce sleep.<br>  <br>  Aint I sneaky??

Actually, around 4 P.M. all humans should take a nap.  It is the #2 time period for the highest rates of on the job and in home injuries, as well as car accidents, per capita.  Four A.M. is #1.<br>  <br>  When he gets home, a quick hot shower, and a nap.  Give him some warm milk to help it along.  Afterward might be a good time for sex.<br>  <br>  As for what happens at night, during that period of time between when you go to sleep and start dreaming, your brain's ability to absorb data is shut down and everything in temporary storage is transferred to permanent storage through the creation of chemical bonds, and synaptic connectors, as needed. While you are dreaming, the data is being categorized. <br>  <br>  At night, your body washes out all the lactic acid that has built up in your muscles during the day, replacing it with oxygen.<br>  <br>  At night, your immune system goes into limited standby mode to regenerate and repair injuries, such as sore and strained muscles.|`|wTz5OHQhaa	Okay well maybe at this point, its starting to become like a normal routine for him... <br>  <br>  I mean I would recommend sleep medication but thats a lil bit extreme. <br>  <br>  I would suggest being more active to get the heart going.

757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Dont bother with the food if its not going to be amazing. Its only an hour, people can wait. As long as you have drinks to refresh people, its fine. And they dont need to be alcoholic.|`|f1de2e7e6c3445e8601e1d2bd92cd759aa	People will probably be hungry!  And, usually, weddings run late.  So your cocktail hour might not even start until 6 or so.  I would be sure to have some sort of food, even if it's not the best food possible.  <br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is that you don't really want people drinking w/out food...<br>  <br>  Enjoy your wedding!|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	I don't like the idea of scheduling all those events before the food. Try this:<br>  <br>  4:00 - ceremony supposedly begins<br>  4:10 - bride shows up, fashionably (or annoyingly, as the case may be) late<br>  4:15-4:45 - ceremony (I have never seen a ceremony last more than twenty minutes, but here's ten minutes extra just in case)<br>  4:45-5:00 - everyone moves over to reception area <br>  5:00 - reception begins<br>  5:15-5:30 - entree served<br>  6:00 - toasts and other ceremonies begin, after everyone's had some food<br>  <br>  You don't need a cocktail hour if you're having a reception - it seems like a waste of time and money, and some of your guests will be confused and worry that the hors d'oeuvres are all that's coming. You don't need to schedule half an hour before the food arrives for congratulations. People are used to doing that during or after the dinner, not beforehand.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me as if your friend was unrealistic as to what $6.50 would buy. I would be very surprised if $6.50 pp bought more than a few shrivelled hors d'oeuvres. This is why wedding vendors who charge significantly less than the competition should be viewed with suspicion: they often provide less than the competition.|`|LAXbJfvwaa	I wouldn't mind not having the food in cocktail hour - but just think of people drinking alcohol on an empty stomach - not a great idea.  It wouldn't be so bad if you were starting eating sooner - but to wait till 6.30 is pushing it a little.  Is it possible to have the entree served at 6 instead of 6.30?  I understand what you are saying about them not serving much for the price so I totally agree that it would be pointless wasting your money - but just don't let your guests go hungry - that is one of the worst things you can do!  Just as a side point too - personally I get more hungry if there is a little bit of food around but not enough to fill me up - so in that sense I would strongly suggest against having the hors douvers.<br>  <br>  Otherwise - why not just skip the cocktail hour?  Go straight to the dinner and people can have drinks and mingle afterwards.  Nothing wrong with that.|`|HSaG98QYaa	Why in the world would you consider getting some passed food "just for show" even though you think it's worthless and too expensive? That's silly. Don't have food! People will be fine drinking and mingling for an hour before they eat. I wouldn't think twice if I showed up to a post-ceremony, pre-reception cocktail hour for drinks and no snacks, which I probably wouldn't eat anyway.<br>  <br>  Please, everyone. When you start doing stuff "just for show" at weddings, that's when you end up with expensive, boring events that look like every other wedding. Do what you want and do it for a good reason -- like, you don't think this food is worth it. So don't have it!|`|4POGapREaa	Hmm.  I'm not a big eater but I would prefer an appetizer during cocktails over a full meal.  I just think it's nice to have something to pop in your mouth while alcohol is being absorbed in the system.  I'm just thinking of me personally & for some reason I feel really gross eating a full meal after I've been drinking.  It just puts me to sleep.  Gradual food with alcohol is okay but alcohol alone while being hungry & then a heavy meal just has a bad effect on me.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	There are very few if any venues that will allow you to serve alcohol without any substantial food due to liability issues since people get drunk easily on empty stomachs. If you aren't going to serve food during the cocktail hour, then serve only non-alcoholic drinks at that time so that you don't have drunk, sick guests whom you will be held solely responsible for.<br>  <br>  As a guest, I wouldn't be upset that you were serving dinner at that time. That is the normal dinner hour. People wait that long to eat (if not longer) everyday so I don't see what the issue is as to it being "too late". It isn't like your cocktail hour starts at 5pm and you won't be serving the main meal until 10pm or later when guests haven't eaten since lunch at noon. I have never been to a wedding that served a full meal, much less a cocktail hour, so I wouldn't be annoyed, but as stated above, if you are serving alcohol of any kind, you must have appetizers. Even if that is a simple meat and cheese platter for everyone.<br>  <br>  Edit: No you don't get them for "show". People need to eat if they are consuming alcohol. There are no ifs, ands or buts about that. If you can't afford anything more than that, you need to cut back elsewhere so that you can afford them. Figure out an area that isn't important like favors or programs for the ceremony or something along those lines that the guests won't miss so that you can afford substantial food.

Your mother may have caught him cheating lately, or in the past, and can not forgive him.  Your mother may have just felt unappreciated or unloved.

You are 18, so you do not need to choose where to live.  Your sister will figure out what SHE needs to do also.<br>  <br>  Don't be angry at either one of them.  Sometimes couples just grow apart.

Even other members of the same family can't really, truly know.  <br>  <br>  Breaking up after 30 years is not something people do lightly or on a whim.  Your mom must have serious reasons for doing this.  She may not be able to/want to give those reasons to others, but nobody up and checks out of a relationship of 30 years without having reasons.  Unless you suspect that she has mental problems of some sort (early onset Alzheimer's, brain tumor, other medical issues going on, I think you need to respect her decision.  Even if you don't understand it.<br>  <br>  It would help if you got counseling.  You don't say if you're in school;  if you are, the school counselor would be a good place to start.  If you aren't still in school, if there's a mental health center of some sort in your area or listed in your phone book, that would be another good place to start.  What you want is a referral to a counselor who can help you sort out your feelings and figure out how to deal with them.<br>  <br>  It sounds like there's a lot of stuff going on in your life.  Sometimes it seems that bad things never happen by themselves, always in bunches.  All the more reason for getting help if you feel overwhelmed.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10065812	???????<br>  GIVE THESE TO YOUR MOTHER:<br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Couples do to Mess up Their Relationships <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Couples-do-to-Mess-up-Their-Relationships/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060512606/?itm=7" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Women-Do-to-Mess-up-Their-Lives/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060976491/?itm=3" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Men-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Lives/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780641865411/?itm=8" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Stupid Things Parents Do to Mess Up Their Kids <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-Things-Parents-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Kids/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060933791/?itm=12" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-...</a><br>  <br>  Stanford University<br>  Divorce, Nontraditional Families, and Its Consequences For Children<br>  "We know that children of divorced parents have more emotional and behavioral problems and do less well in school than children who live with both their Parent."<br>  <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rmahony/Divorce.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanford.edu/~rmahony/Divorce...</a><br>  <br>  GIVE THIS TO YOU FATHER, IF SHE GOES FORWARD WITH THE DIVORCE.<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.<br>  <br>  Part of the problem with getting your rights knowing what to do to prove your case, and how to remind the judge of their responsibilities.  Let me start with the judge.<br>  <br>  Always take people with you to court who are not there to testify.  Make sure they are sitting where the judge can see them, each equipped with a tablet and pen to take notes.  It’s best to use a Court Watch Form designed for this purpose.  I have one in the manual at Dads House.<br>  <br>  If the judge is not doing his job, using the info from this form, you can, appeal, and/or get  the judge sanctioned and removed from the case.  You file a complaint with the State Supreme Court at your state capital.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

FzS3aphWaa	She has given you no reason to trust her to do the makeup and hairstyle that you want.  She is not set up as a beauty salon and will have to purchase the makeup that she will use.  If she buys quality makeup, she will be spending quite a bit.  Is she planning to charge you the full cost of everything she has to buy?  She also has to purchase the items needed to do your hair.  Again, she will be paying retail prices for these products as she will not be buying the quantity needed to get a wholesale price.  She has not yet quoted you a price and can charge anything she wants after she has done the job and you have no recourse.  You are going to end up with a look that she thinks is nice and you have already decided that you do not like the type of look that she likes.  Why, again, are you having her do your look for one of the most important days of your life?|`|4POGapREaa	This kind of stuff pisses me off because I do freelance work & my clients are important to me.  I just happen to be a licensed "non practicing" hairstylist as well so it's a double whammy.  Yes, it's rude.<br>  <br>  First of all, kids are not an excuse.  I don't have any & I know you understand her, but it's highly unprofessional to bring your personal life & drama into your business.  She could have been more professional & used a difference excuse but she used the mom excuse because maybe she knew you would relate & she was probably lying anyway.<br>  <br>  Then she shows up with a serious lack of skills, care, or concern & makes you feel uncomfortable.  Bad business.  And WTF is she picking up for your hair?  I only do friends & family & I'm pretty well stocked on colors, developers, etc.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, fourthly, and fifthly, she should have given you a clear price.  Why you didn't challenge her on that is beyond me.  Who wants to wonder whether it's going to be $100 or $1,000?<br>  <br>  And lastly, I don't give a sh!t if she's busy & only has time to return calls at 10pm, that's on her, and you should never assume a client is even awake past 8pm at the latest.  She's either hustling & overworked, needs an assistant, or just isn't up to par & might have been drinking all day.  Who knows.  In any case, yes it's unprofessional & I would be pissed too.<br>  <br>  And why is she putting her lack of availability on you by saying that she's going out to buy stuff for YOUR hair like that's a reason?  That should have been done a long time ago.  If I was doing your hair, I would be more stressed than you are, and would have all my T's crossed & all my I's dotted because I'm responsible & I wouldn't stress out a bride.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	she doesnt sound very realiable if you ask me, what if she doesnt show up the day you get married cause of some unknown reason.

You should fire her and find another hairstylist, one who is a professional (which this woman is not, and *that* is why she charges less).<br>  <br>  Yet another example of a wedding vendor promising that they will charge you less than others would, then providing you with less than what you agreed upon.  Never hire anyone who charges significantly less than the going rate - there's always a reason, and the reason is always bad. Always.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	After 8 pm, it better be important, after 10 it better be life threatening or don't call me... <br>  <br>  I think you're right to be po'd.

Follow up in writing in case she tries to say you have a contract.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Actually my mom goes to a hairstylist that works at home, and talking at that hour is fairly reasonable. <br>  <br>  Still, I would have fired her long before, for being so unreliable and not even giving me a price, and for the fact that I hated her work!<br>  <br>  If you really like her, ask her not to call at that time again. she won't.

Personally I wouldn't have hired someone that I didn't know or that didn't work at a salon for my wedding. Again, if you want to stay with her tell her that you can't talk at that hour-- if you are trying to be so helpful, hiring a new stylist in town, the feedback would help her for other customers too.|`|bHhCxCnXaa	Well congrats on the wedding.

If you don't feel special on your birthday, and expect something nice to happen to you!  You've lost what it is to feel alive. Just because your grown up doesnt mean you cant act like a kid every now and then! Especially on your birthday. Let your friend know how you feel! Then you'll know where you stand.|`|iUKWCu2Yaa	i forget sometimes. it doesn't ,ean I care for them any less.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	expensive gadgets hmmmm.... may be she doesn't see u as the way u wanna it to be|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	is she pissed off wit u for something?<br>  is she dealing with terrible issues of her own at this moment dat hav caused her to forget?<br>  is she broke at the moment a lil strapped for cash which wud make her shy away from wishing u empty handed?<br>  think all these, n u might find a reason why she didnt wish u.<br>  but either ways i think all of the above are a lame excuse compared to 10 long yrs of friendship- and i mean she could have talked to u about watever at least.  HAPPY BELATED!!|`|6XbkGZGxaa	is your friend under alot of stress at school/work/home? If so that could be the cause. Give them a few more day and if they still don't remember and you truly are good friends then confront her about it. waiting forever will only make it worse.

If no then she probably deliberately did not call you. If the answer is yes, then she may have also made one. Give her the space to change (forgive her), don't choke her with the mistakes of the past.|`|e6657aae9a5e6165c0768975ea7fd38daa	you seem childish but i would just let it slide mayby she is planning something or mayby she just forgot...my best friend forgets alot but i don't complain just tell her how you feel but birthdays don't mean anything really because its alot more to life then that!|`|ShdV8jm4aa	If you were my friend...I would. Not because I'm a bad friend but because I'm a bubble head. I don't remember things like that. It slips right by me.<br>  <br>  Maybe she had a tough day, call her & talk with her about it.|`|x1qKGmzSaa	no, they dont. thats crap. if something happened or shes upset about something, its understandable, but if not, then no. thats just mean.<br>  <br>  :(|`|oZ5QPymuaa	Maybe she got into trouble or something is holding her back from doing it. If u tell her, im SURE she will be sorry and give u sumthing|`|9MoytEURaa	my friends are like that TOO.<br>  <br>  sometimes i wanna just punch them lol .<br>  but i dnt know why i always buy them stuff anyways..|`|ZyBXnK6eaa	mine does that 2. i was so pissed! but then i forgot hers.....sso i got over it|`|rFlhIgJXaa	it happens|`|Z0PqY7soaa	i'm so sorry! i would be devastated if that had happened to me.<br>  i guess it depends on the friend's personality and don't forget to take into account if they are forgetful or not.<br>  <br>  if your friend is very unorganized and forgets dates and deadlines a lot, it is probably and honest mistake.<br>  <br>  but like you said, "she KNOWS it"; well if she knows it, then maybe she just doesn't consider you to be a close or true friend enough to take the time out of her day to at least call. <br>  <br>  an honest friend would at least have a card ready or make a call to let you know that she cares :)|`|k8GgGGOgaa	Sometimes people get preoccupied with things they have to deal with, and sometimes they just forget. Try not to take it personally. If you are worried she is mad at you or something, just ask her. If you are really her friend, something like this won't get in the way of your friendship. Try to relax, and do something nice for yourself!|`|1mJajydiaa	Oh hell! U r friends from 10 yrs. And this little jerk made u point a question on your bond.

It was my Birthday! :)"  and see what she does.
LXPMsKxxaa	Be straight forward- tell him what you're concerned about, and ask him to explain his feelings. You could very well be making this into a much bigger deal than what it has to be, and you can't expect him to read your mind. Don't play games- just be honest. Tell him to do the same. That way you can be clear about your intentions and you can make a logical decision. |`|4Aungmanaa	Ask him whats going on|`|J133qETUaa	Think about this ! Why does man need woman ?<br>  honestly you can say sex or marriage .<br>  so ask yourself , what has he gotten from you ?  <br>  for friendship , that is something different in your case.<br>  if I was you , I had to ask him about marriage ( just a question ) and that at the beginning so when you know his intentions you can make your mind . believe me it's too easy .

dc9bae544d912bed64b470032d9771a9aa	Respect his wishes, wouldn't you want the same thing?  If she still wants to speak with you mention to her that you were blocked. Put the ball in her court. If he is trying to be domineering and she does not appreciate it, it is up to her to resolve it.
6a648399b74d5a82faead69b7ab81860aa	You can't. If someone doesn't like you then they just don't like you. Most likely there's nothing you can do to change that. If you think this person has gotten the wrong impression of you or has misunderstood you, then you should try to show how you really are. If that person still doesn't like you then it would be best to just back off before you seem crazy & obsessed.|`|da8fc8fa359e667e9c09f2a3ff14f0dcaa	is that rhetorical?

mMBzpldbaa	me and my boyfriend love having anal sex. i was really nervous the first few times, just like you are now, but after speaking to an online friend about it, i felt just fine.<br>  <br>  ok, he should really lube up one finger and slowly push it into your anus. everything should be done at your pace here. try backing yourself onto his finger now, and it should start to feel really good about now.<br>  <br>  relube and repeat with two fingers. relube and repeat with three fingers.<br>  <br>  <br>  then comes the penis. make sure he has enough lube on there to sink a small battalion of hippos. too much lube the first time is never enough.<br>  <br>  doggy style is best for first time anal, i've found. have him keep his penis still and back yourself on really slowly. if the head "pops" in then you're going too fast. make sure you're still backing onto it until you're comfortable with him moving.<br>  <br>  when you are, make sure it's slow, long strokes. the faster stuff comes when you've done it a few more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  if you're not using condoms, and i know i don't, then make sure to tense your bum after he pulls out, or you'll have semen everywhere. have tissue handy if you're nervous :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and a side note, try to poop an hour or so beforehand. enemas can work as well, but i've never needed to use them. he won't get poop on his penis unless you have diarrhea.<br>  <br>  <br>  i can orgasm form anal sex and i love it. it took me a few times to like it thoguh, just like regular vaginal sex. just have fun with it :) and ignore the anal haters on here, they haven't done it right if they don't enjoy it. either that or they're religious puritans.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Anal sex? Is he gay? I thought for sure he had duped you into a 3some what a buzz kill to get here and find out his fantasy is your hershey highway. Ive dated women that wanted that an Ive done it but its no fantasy to put my happy hammer in your wazoo. Now bring your cute little friend over for some mattress wrestling we got the makings of a fantasy. Unless he's a sadist or homosexual the only one thats gonna end up getting joy in the long run is you. God don't make mistakes and he ate his wheaties the day he made the vagina.|`|GzL8X6vTaa	It's going to hurt horribly but I do it sometimes for my guy last night as a matter of fact.<br>  <br>  The best advice that I can give is try to focus on something else and try and make sure that you are pleasuring yourself as he is pleasuring himself.|`|AA11460234	Personally my opinon is I find that rather degrading. And trust me...I'm not a puritan by ANY stretch of the imagination.<br>  <br>  However once again...to each their own. And hurt? Oh yeah....brace yourself.<br>  <br>  By the way...you'll be relieved to know that you'll be the only one who'll feel discomfort (Ha!...that's an understatement). He'll feel no pain at all.<br>  <br>  hope that makes you feel a little more at ease.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	If your man rushes it will hurt; however, lots of lubrication and tons of foreplay will ease that.  I highly recommend using a condom for protection against any possible infections.  Good Luck|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	Give yourself an enema before hand, and make him kiss and lick your butt hole before he lubes it up, and get you used to having thing up the back door!  Enjoy!|`|wmOgseCgaa	Yes it will hurt. Relax, use a condom and lots of lube, you may enjoy it though many do|`|GaLw1qMwaa	the first time might not be great but if you get into the fantasy eno you will like it alot.|`|GQ6f2wSbaa	Get a product called AnalEze; it will numb you just enough to take away any discomfort.  It's great you are letting your man do this, because it can be such a great experience, for both of you.  After you have done it for awhile, you will be surprised how enjoyable it is.  Many women actually grow to prefer it over vaginal intercourse.<br>  <br>  All of the people saying you should stick something in your husband too, actually have a point, although they don't realize it.  For a man to get his prostate stimulated from anal action is an incredible pleasure.  Personally, it is my favourite thing; the orgasms are intense.  Trust me, your man will soon never be able to get enough of it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Lol @ Zilla  ;)<br>  (((((((zilla)))))))|`|ydposAFXaa	WOW, you got a lot of answers - most are useless though.<br>  Anyway, It shouldn't hurt.  If it hurt just stop for a few minutes, if it really hurts you may have to stop all together.<br>  In my experience I could never quite enjoy myself with full anal sex.  So for like a year (no kidding) when he would go down on my he would play with my back door with his finger or tongue the eventually a toy.  many times it felt so good that I wanted his penis but it hurt so we stopped and went back to what we were doing.<br>  Be sure to start with him performing lots of oral sex on you.  Have him play with all of you including your anus.  Get him to tease you and make sure you are ready to move on.<br>  My preferred position for anal is missionary.  It sounds boring but I like the eye contact - I think a lot of extra communication is key in the beginning.  Then we switch to other positions then missionary again for climax because I like to see his face.<br>  Anyway, lots of really good lube.  Not drugstore stuff, go online to a Pure Romance site and order lube specifically made for anal sex.  It's thin and works great with out getting sticky.  <br>  I also like ot have a few glasses of red wine to relax beforehand.  <br>  Just remember to relax, do not rush, and stop if it hurts.  there is always next time to do it the right way so everyone can have fun.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	It sucks. We've tried it several times and I got nothing from it, ever. The only time it was ever really.. err, successful is when I was so numb I felt nothing.<br>  Personally I think guys just want to stick their dicks wherever you will let them. I like to say "Can I put this dildo in your *** first?"<br>  <br>  I love the thumbs down.. it's weird how guys think just because regular sex is pleasurable for us it must be just as pleasurable in any other hole in our bodies. Sorry boys, my behind is just as much virgin as yours.|`|KsejjxaOaa	yes relax and lub and spit isnt lub , but even more inportant move slow and dont pull out stop have him stay put if you have to but the beginning is the worst part once its in its alot better after a while it canand will  be enjoyable for both.|`|HRegfSrEaa	Yes it hurts. I dont like it at all. I find it rather selfish....it doesnt feel good at all and is quite a pain in the a**....Give it a try once and you will know that his fantasy doesnt have to play out again. Use lots of lube.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	it can hurt and probably will hurt the first time, you do have to use lube...lots of it!  lol...BUT, it can be enjoyable....tell him he HAS to go slowly!  relax, lube, slow and it can and probably will be very fun!  OH!  did i say RELAX???|`|mJ5JzuPUaa	do it you may enjoy it and itll make your relationship stronger go for it but have fun to ease the nervouseness plus he might love that u nervous becuase u take more time and are gentle but sexy  with it.good luck|`|T272vObnaa	Make sure you're very relaxed, and very turned on before you attempt it.  If you are, it can be an extremely sensual experience.  And don't forget the lube.|`|DntzRXczaa	go slow and gentle...if it to rough especially the first time you can and will probably bleed...make him go slow not like he is f*ing you normal doggy and going to town...|`|AA11264704	Lots of lubrication and have him start off slow...REALLY slow. Good luck!|`|fE1GFxbRaa	astroglide!!!|`|KZlgdMeEaa	relaxation and lots of lube.  easy at first.... good luck. btw i always insist on a condom for that too.|`|MPYQ2Mfuaa	good luck .. it hurts alot|`|fAdh5BAkaa	have fun!|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	lube lube lube!|`|KILFoc6kaa	Yes it can hurt. You must be totally relaxed, or it just wont work.  Lots of lube, patience and communication.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	If you feel uncomfortable DON'T DO IT!  If he wants anal sex let him go do it with a man.  I would take that as an insult that my "natural" was not good enough.

There will be lots of great info provided from other brides in your area.|`|dAfUEMDKaa	Well I have already paid for mine in advance.  It will be $900 for 5 hours.  That includes the ceremony music, microphones hidden on us and the minister.  The reception (at a different location).  We saw this DJ at another wedding we attended and he was great.  Not cheesey at all.  Kept the flow going and there was always something going on to keep people happy.  Great music and really professional.|`|vyL7yEleaa	my DJ is running around $595 (and as my fiance just groaned behind me and is now bitching lol) <br>  <br>  that was the cheapest one in the area all the others wanted the high $700 or even in the $1K range.. this DJ is highly recommended by the wedding site.|`|29mCE3V7aa	25000 will be the maximum amount for Dj for a day|`|kHEFi3ttaa	My fiancé and I will be  using ourselves, as in our associate will run our equipment. You see we are DJ's. The three of us work as a team at most events we go to (particularly b-day parties). My fiancé and I own and run the business, our friend covers for us when we've got a double booking and is learning the "ropes". We charge $300 for the first 4 hours and $25 for each additional hour after. We are considerably cheaper then other DJ's in our area. We charge $200-400 cheaper then other companies. As our price includes a consultation and all of our equipment, they choose what they do and don't want. We charge less because we don't feel like people should be breaking their wallets to get what they want from a special event. We want to be their for the people that hire us and make things as stress free as possible for them because planning an event is stressful enough, especially for a wedding (we should know.. :D). We follow up with them days after the event and on various times to make sure they're doing ok. We don't consider the people who have hired us as "clients" they're part of our business family. We serve parts of TN. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congratulations<br>  <br>  P.S. I know I'm a bit biased but think about hiring someone that does this on their own more so then a radio DJ. A radio DJ can get a DJ job (aside from their station) due to name alone and are less likely to truly care about your feelings because their name gets them hired. Your word is against a name behind a car radio, not so good when you try to warn people. PLUS they're normally more expensive. Also ALWAYS ask for reference letters and to see their website/page. Candid pictures and videos as well, as they often tell more then just a letter. Do the guests look bored or like they're having a good time? If its a video, is the DJ interacting with the guests of standing behind his equipment all night? Ask about how long they've been in business officially and unofficially. Beware of DJs who will make a cd for you, as unless he has specific permission form the artist/recording company it's illegal. <br>  Once again good luck|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It depends on where you are located because large cities are always more expensive than small towns.

The wedding is at the bingham house and the dj is "dj"Hope this works out...................................|`|rHuAhN3iaa	We paid approximately $600 for a four hour dance. We will be using the sound system in the hall hooked up to my fiance's Ipod for music during cocktails and dinner to save ourselves some money.<br>  <br>  We're using a local company, I can give you a name if you're from Saskatchewan, Canada. :)|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	My friend that does this on the side usually charges about $700.00 but we are going to see if he can do it for us as his gift to us for free :)|`|xuiSfzgraa	My DJ is $650 for 6 hours.  He came highly recommended, so I thought it would be twice the ammount that it was!

I didn't even want to go but my mom pushed me into it (this was in the '80s).  I acquiesced and went with my boyfriend of 2 years.  He showed up 2 hours late, without my flowers and told me stop crying about it.  I had a miserable time.  And, yes, I dated him for another year or so (go figure).  If your brother did not go to prom it's no big deal.  He's probably happier.|`|AA11319441	Yup, it was 12 years ago, but me and my friends made a pact that we weren't going to go.

t81MEJ82aa	If you're wife is loving and only looking for no strings attached sex then perhaps this isn't any failing of your own. Also if it doesn't bother you then you shouldn't convince yourself that it does. My only concern is that if she's having unprotected sex then you should be concerned for your own health. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would gather all of the proof I could. Definitely make copies of the ads, save them electronically also, think about hiring a PI, and consult with a divorce attorney discreetly. That way if you decide that you don't want to be in this situation you already have a leg up.<br>  <br>  EDITED: I was hoping to type fast enough because my answer is genuine and wanted to post before all of the knee JERK responses.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	YOU MUST TELL HER YOU KNOW ABOUT HER SEX LIFE IT NOT RIGHT..

WORK CAN WAIT .. |`|xKjecOTYaa	Dude... I cant believe you are still there. A puddle in the panties, and you "aren't sure what to do". What a shame. The very least thing you should do is leave. Have some self respect, get out and go enjoy life. I cant imagine that kind of misery. |`|gsS0c3yVaa	OMG!  If this posting is not a joke, someone needs to reach through their computer screen and strangle you!!!!!!!! The problem isn't with her, it's YOU!!! Are you codependent or financially bound to her??  I'm pissed and I don't even know her or you!! <br>  <br>  If it is that obvious, it is time to to start making the right moves. Get your accounts in order, a place to go, evidence, a LAWYER!!  :-O AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way, she's NOT a good mom if she's riding every pole she walks by, and exposing you (AND YOUR KIDS) to the potential of any kinds of STD's or whatever she might contract.<br>  <br>  Damn dude, if I knew where you lived, I would help you pack your **** myself!!!!!! |`|qpAYU8Knaa	She may be having sex with others because she likes variety and not because you cannot satisfy her. Talk to her openly about what her needs are, your concerns about unsafe sex, etc. If you cannot handle her wants then try to negotiate with her. Last resort will be a divorce, but think about the kids if they are young. Don't blame yourself, she might have extra-marital sex no matter who she is married to. |`|T4N6a7MQaa	If I knew my wife was cheating on me the last thing I'd worry about is if she's practicing safe sex. There wouldn't be any more sex with me anyway. Personally I'd be gone a long time ago. |`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Tell her not to leave her dirty underwear on the floor.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	"One side of me says that if this is what she needs to be happy, I should let her have it. The other side says that it's not right and I should feel humiliated that I can't keep my wife satisfied in the bedroom."<br>  <br>  dude, i'm seriously SICK and tired of seeing weak-doormatted-husbands. are you seriously considering this!!! what she did was no excuse whether you had anything to do with it or not.<br>  <br>  why do you think she hid this from you for 20 years? why do you think she rushes straight to the shower after work, why do you think she posts naked pictures of her on the internet without you knowing? can you take a wild guess? its because she KNEW it was wrong!!! but she did it anyway! what does that say about her character and morals? shes a cheater and she can give a flying flip about the true meaning of marriage.<br>  <br>  what amazes me is that people always say "if you cheat, dont ever tell your partner just dont let it happen again."<br>  <br>  well secrets ALWAYS have a way of coming out. if she would have told you, it probably would not have hurt or been so shocking and cruel as to just finding out on your own.<br>  <br>  if you can't keep your wife satisfied, she should have came to you and spoke about it, her lack of satisfaction was no excuse to get it from someone else. if you want to be a doormat and be humliated by letting the town know that you wife likes to spread her legs and you just sit there and allow it, fine. do so.|`|TbENA08baa	Something's not right. What..is she using you for financial reason? home security? ...but she is using you.<br>  Did it ever occur to you that she could give you an STD? <br>  You need to confront her about all this. <br>  Follow her from work a few days or get someone else to.|`|bpjpD7W3aa	sit her down and confront her, call a pastor and ask to talk to him, there is nothing like sound biblical advise, it would be great for her too.<br>  if you forgive that is best, although she may give you an std<br>  stay with her if she repents and changes.<br>  |`|b0g9hOdjaa	First of all you shouldn't feel humiliated about any of this.  You love your wife and expect her to love you back.  You want your marriage to work, that's admirable.  <br>  <br>  However, the fact that you are on here asking this means that you are no longer willing to let her get away with this anymore.  She might be happy but are you?  You  aren't getting any younger, don't you want to feel good about yourself and your partner?<br>  <br>  She obviously has no respect for you or your marriage.  She has a great job and is a good mother, but she's a shitty-*** wife.  Screwing other people off and on for the majority of your marriage does not make her and "all in all good wife".  <br>  <br>  Sorry buddy, but you need to grow some balls and confront her.  Let her know that you know and you will no longer stand for this behavior.  You will no longer be her second choice in life.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|elhcuN19aa	1st you cant judge a book by its cover... God looks at us the same way... The inside is what counts... The not look like the type even applied to my cheating ex...<br>  <br>  the choice is yours to make....<br>  I had the luxury of catching my ex gf in the act....<br>  Good thing I did not marry her....<br>  Your wife was being selfish back then question is is she still cheating now?<br>  <br>  She is overwhelmed in the office alright.... With another man I would drive up there before she gets off an pop in and stay...<br>  <br>  live 10 mins away from hom and you come in at 6:30 plus... with no food or shopping to show for the wasted time?<br>  She is playing you son......<br>  <br>  Time for you to put your foot down and if she dont like it then boot her for the infidelity and separate or divorce<br>  <br>  Btw semen in panties! wow they was your answer right there and the going to the shower was to was off the other guy's smells!<br>  <br>  Personally I would leave! if she held on to that secret for sooo long , no telling what else she has to hide!|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	I also had a wife that was cheating on me and when I suspected it, I asked her.  That weekend I moved out.  I suggest that you ask her directly and immediately and if she says yes, just like mine did, move out and on with your life.  Good Luck|`|HyX2FJJraa	I don't know how you define a "good wife", but in my book, a good wife doesn't have sex with other men behind my back.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a cuckold then stay with her. If you want your self-respect back leave.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	If you are not a troll, no offense, but much about your details does not add up.  The semen in the underwear incident was a year ago, you say.  So, what changed?  You think your wife has been unfaithful to you multiple times, maybe hundreds of times, over the years.  So, why are you now concerned?  What happened to the veneer of denial with which you used to treat this subject?<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your wife.  Calmly tell her what you suspect and what you know, and get her take on it.  Make this a conversation that is not about confrontation, but about opening up and finally being honest with each other.  Tell her up front that you don't know what will happen, but that a need to talk is there, and find out what she has to say.|`|6ypXMb1jaa	Sad. You deserve better. You deserve respect, love and fidelity. People wouldn't marry if they did not expect those things from their partner. <br>  <br>  File for divorce.

Leave!!<br>  Are you crazy or just gutless?  She's sleeping around and you don't know what to do??  What gives?

See how she likes it.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	sup to you and what you can handle...<br>  <br>  first off since you are asking this you are NOT ready for your relationship to end... so if you can't handle her knowing you know and her still playing ignore it.<br>  <br>  If you CAN handle her knowing and still playing around then you need to talk to her.. find out what is going on.... <br>  <br>  there are generally 2 reasons she would be playing outside the relationship...<br>  <br>  1) she likes encounters with strangers.. and that sounds unlikely<br>  <br>  2) she likes specific types of sex and doesn't think you are into or would welcome them.. ropes chains etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  either way there is nothing to be ashamed of.. we all have different kinks.. and none of em are wrong... just different..<br>  <br>  if you can handle it.. find out what her kink is.. maybe it matches yours and if so yall will both be happier...<br>  <br>  but understand that once you broach the issue... if you can't handle her playing outside the relationship.. and you can't fulfill whatever she is looking for. you will be dooming the relationship... so go into it knowing you may not change anything except removing the lies.<br>  <br>  |`|Cw5TRP02aa	FIRST: u need to get tested for STD's<br>  <br>  SECOND: you need to come to the realization that its over, you are never going to trust her again, and you guys need to remain friends for the sake of the kids... you don't have to go out of your way to expose what she's done.... she also may be a sex addict. |`|Tvk66fjJaa	First of all let me applaud you for being an adult about it. <br>  In my situation I never cheated. I just gave out my cell # to a male and my spouse found out about it. Its been over a year and he still calls me every five minutes at work and wont let me out of his sight. I am being overwhelmed with his smothering and in the long run that is what is going to break us up, not the fact that I gave out my phone number. In your case my advice, being a woman, is to just ask her. Dont sneak around, dont spy, dont hire anyone. Just ask her. If you have been with her for that long, you will know right away if she is lying. If she is cheating there is a chance she doesnt want to be with you anymore and its time to move on. I know, easier said than done. Be strong. |`|szyUVMOlaa	You deserve more than this. What are you gaining from staying in a relationship which is making you feel this way? End it. You will never have trust back in your relationship and there are millions of women out there who would treat you better than this.|`|68b44e1447cd07a05f63d57f1733c707aa	Grow a pair, be a man let her know you know and you are not going to stand by and be treated like blind idiot.  Have some dignity!|`|AA10016542	confront her about it |`|9274b33891a5de9d8ca235476fff09bfaa	It's not good to end anything on an assumption. Although, it does seem likely that it's right. You need to get facts before acting. The best way to do it is to talk to her. She might get mad and she might start arguing, but who else will know what she does better than herself? don't let her walk all over you! And if she is cheating, it is WRONG! Don't let her do that to you. Everyone deserves someone to love them and dedicate themselves to them, and them only.You shouldn't be humiliated, but if she is cheatin, she should be. Talk it out, before it gets worse. What if your kids find out what she is doin? So I would figure it out now! Good luck to you!|`|AA11119024	i don't think it has anything to do with you not satisfying her!   i wonder why you would even let her treat you like that?!   if your gut is telling you something is wrong more than likely your right!   if shes out cheating then she could be exposing you to all sorts of diseases!!   leave her!!  find someone who will treat you right!   in all it really sounds like she is a sex addict and is living two lives!    it might be something more serious than just cheating...  mentally!   if you need solid proof get a professional involved or put cameras and a gps in her car so you can find out yourself!  but it sounds like you need to move on!   best of luck!|`|AjPnMTK7aa	maybe it wasn't semen..it could of been discharge from her its very common...<br>  if it was milky kind of fluid its normal..it could of been from her but if it was milky kinda greenish she might have something like a yeast infection..<br>  but other than that<br>  you need to have a serious convo with your wife!<br>  your letting her think she can do this and you are ALWAYS going to be there when she comes home..<br>  |`|DBgt6z1eaa	Do yourself a favor and put an end to all the Bullsh*t lies she is feeding you. If she were a good mother and wife she would have no reason to put nude pictures of herself anywhere, nor would she be looking for sex any where else. I am sorry to say but i would never put up with that, nor would i expect anyone to put up with that if i were that way. She obviously has a secret life that you dont even know about. What is wrong with you, have you no self respect. It is obvious she does not respect you. I would never do that to my husband, she is not a good wife.I am very sorry to hear such a horrible situation, that must suck . good luck, whatever you decide, because the decision is your to make, and only yours. |`|MCN7SFaRaa	i had hubby like that before i couldnt believe he cheated but he did!i fixed his butt i cheat to and he got mad so i let him know i can play that game too!he didnt work out he kept on i did i decide stop and i left him and abouted my bday time  i went to the doctor and yes the doctor told me bad news and boy i cry my eyes out!and i went to him with it and he said i were sooo sorry and he ask me forgive him i cant said b/c you mite report me read between the line!and i went on line about 2002 i found my soulmate and i were scare to date again and i took chance and i told him and every sense then we still together!and im lettin you know if you love her you give another chace or tell her its over!dont play games by cheating back i know i pay the price good im giving you advice please take it!be with her or leave her good luck!|`|Poogw5M4aa	DUH, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY CHEATING ON YOU.  SHE'S ALSO A HOE, GET RID OF HER!!|`|W6NCtaEeaa	I've never been in that sort of situation, but I have had to deal with boyfriends cheating on me.<br>  <br>  I think she needs to be confronted - majorly. I can understand maybe doing it once in the past, and having stopped...but if she hasn't stopped...then she needs a bit of a wake-up call. You definitely don't deserve that, and frankly she should know better. It sounds almost as if she's taking for granted everything the both of you have - just to get a bit on the side. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would never stand for that.  I'd confront them, and tell them to either stop, or they're out of my life, simple enough. <br>  <br>  Take a stand for yourself, and tell her that you know. Tell her that she needs to make a choice, and if she really does not want to be loyal to you...then divorce is really the only solution.<br>  <br>  I think that's actually very disrespectful to you if she's not using protection either - because that can actually open you to getting a disease if you do anything with her and she's managed to get an STD.<br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for the best, and good luck with talking to her about this. |`|YAiKlPkMaa	You should divorce her, seriously. This isn't even an issue in my mind. You see a puddle of semen in her panties and it isn't yours, well it isn't hers either. You're lucky if she doesn't give you a good dose of something. Why are you hanging around? I don't get it. She sounds like she's a sex addict. She's putting ads on line and offers anal sex, I can't wrap my mind around this behavior.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	The work thing I would normally believe.  Lots of people are work addicts.<br>  <br>  The shower thing is a red flag.<br>  <br>  The personal ads ... umm ... is you stupid?<br>  <br>  Hire a PI, get the evidence, and then ... since she seems so blatant, unrepentant, and merciless about it ... I would take that b*tch to the cleaners.<br>  <br>  Edit: I have to respect your choice to stick with this woman if she is otherwise a good person.  I don't think I could deal but that is me and I am glad you have a bigger heart.  Good luck to you sir.  If you are happy enough with the way things are, getting it out in the open might actually change things for the worse.  Or OTOH she might try to cut back.  It's hard to say.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	why are u blaming yourself for her choices?when my husband cheated on me,i gave him a way out, asked him once to come home, and that we would go to therapy, and work things out. all he did was laugh at me. so soon after i filed for divorce, left the area, and that was it. cheating is never right.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Damn man! Grow a pair of ball$ and confront her on it!! Or, maybe get some VD that She brought home to you and make sure to thank her for it. You will be fine.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	If you are a masochist then stay with her. If you are a real man with dignity then calmly confront her and tell her you're filing for divorce. You can bet your life that she has been cheating on you for at least 20 years and never missed a day. My guess is that you put yourself in denial for 20 years. If she truly loved you it would not matter if you did not satisfy her in the bedroom. I'll bet she never asked you to do her anally. If you're not ready to see a lawyer then you just have to learn to live with it.  |`|AA11053540	First of all, there is no need to feel humiliated. Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) said in one of his books that "no 10 men can satisfy a single woman" (or words to that effect).  As you describe the situation, it sounds as though your wife is one of those types...never satisfied.<br>  As to your situation, try talking to her. Don't make accusations, but gently ask questions and try to determine the truth. Then try to determine if you two wish to continue together or not.<br>  Good luck.

Unfortunately, some delusional guys think that women are just being coy.

He will learn his lesson.<br>  <br>  I think he likes that you are playing (being) hard to get.<br>  <br>  try doing the opposite, come on to him really hard, tell you want him every which way. Tell him you really like having 2 or 3 guys at the same time.<br>  <br>  Something has got to turn him off of you, be creative.<br>  <br>  Or put him on the spot. Tell him if he likes you he better buy a ring right now and give it to you, otherwise your done with him.<br>  <br>  if he is crazy enough to pop the question then make his life hell until he gives up. Then you get to keep the ring.<br>  <br>  Think outside the legal, moral, sanity, box.|`|S8RL9lieaa	Tell him that a jokes a joke but you don't find it funny anymore and if he doesn't stop you are going to have no choice but tell someone.

25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I think that he is being childish and he does need to think about finances before taking off work. I think (by what you said) he is somewhat spiteful/angry at the fact you do not work and I am in the same boat, I am engaged and I feel really bad that I cannot help out a lot with paying for things and I don't work because I have Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue/IBS/Depression and I did have a job but I had to stop going because I was unable to concentrate, I was falling asleep at my desk, in pain all the time, etc. The guy I am with understands and knows that I want to work, I just am physically unable. I think that he shouldn't throw that in your face and I would (if I were you) ask him if he has a problem with you not having a job and if so maybe you should wait to get married to him, you don't want to regret it later and I think that if he loved you he wouldn't say such mean things. Talk with him, see what he says and go from there. If he is spiteful of your not being able to have a job now then I personally think that you should let him go and be with someone else. I am sorry for everything you are going through ((((hugs))))|`|vyL7yEleaa	my father does the same basic thing, my mother has been hospitalized several times and is now on SSI so he is the only person working and in this economy it is hurting alot of families. <br>  <br>  alot of men like to turn things around on us but sometimes they are feeling stressed, or resentful. that's the reason my dad does it because he is resentful that he is the only one bringing in money and he hounds on me alot because i am not working. <br>  <br>  i would sit down and talk to him to why he always throws that back in your face specially since he knows you can't work.|`|QdTd6Preaa	Dump that loser quick and, get a job.  The world is not a kind place and, apparently neither is your fiancee.

I was fine til I met him then he verbally and physically abused to depression. He did that to me all the time. Saying he was sorry and all that good ****. He was full of ****.

Ugh...now I wanna kick his ***.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	This is a bad direction the relationship's headed toward.. you have to start being assertive (as you have) and talk to him about these problems.. and try to work out a solution that works for both of you.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Are you sure you want to marry this man?

If you worked out, you would lose the depression.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	He's a man.

That is childish and petty. Taking things so offensivly so easily is ridiculous.|`|niGAKJT4aa	either because he's not a very nice person, or your comment offended him and he felt the need to make you feel bad as well.|`|l9LL5xOvaa	Simple answer: He's needs to grow up and stop acting childish.|`|2LDGlA1Paa	I agree that your unemployed status is probably bothering your boyfriend and he used it to lash out at you in anger instead of talking with you about how he feels.  Most common cause of this type of behavior: immaturity and/or selfishness.<br>  <br>  It was reasonable to point out the reality of the situation regarding the lack of financial resources the two of you seem to have.<br>  <br>  Personally, I hope you're not collecting SSI/Disability for "Major Depression" and would suggest that you trying doing something for someone else (ie: be a volunteer somewhere, join something at your church, etc)  It's been my experience that when I stop thinking about myself and my problems by doing something for someone else, I get a better perspective on my life and I feel a lot better than before.|`|3RGqsE7Qaa	OPINION<br>  <br>  First of all, I just want to say screw what your pill pushing doctor says.  Get you a fulfilling job out in the sun.  Work with your hands.  Or do whatever thing you think you would fill most satisfied doing.  Something that would challenge you.  Doing that will definitely make your life better; alone, and with your man.<br>  <br>  Second, when you talk to your man, it should be supportive, encouraging.  Your man needs your back.  He wants to spend his life with you, he wants you to be there for the rest of his life.  So be there.<br>  <br>  You do have the right to be upset.  That was weak of him.  But you were not faultless in that situation.  No one is perfect, so don't expect each other to be.  Forgiveness is the key to a happy life.|`|ONrpXr3Raa	I'm currently working full time, 40+ hours a week. (saving up for school).<br>  <br>  My boyfriend works 3 (if that) days a week no more than 5 hours a day. He has one class twice a week.<br>  He also has a serious back problem which is the reason he can't work.<br>  <br>  I understand this completely, but sometimes it does get annoying being the 'working one' in the relationship.<br>  Not meaning to, I will, make comments to him like your fiance did.<br>  <br>  I get very stressed sometimes having to work so much at such a crap job when he only works 15- hours a week.  It seems so unfair.<br>  <br>  I never truly mean what I say. Everyone gets so angry sometimes that they'll say whatever they can to hurt the person they're talking to.<br>  <br>  Talk to your fiance.  Tell him he stepped out of line and remind him why you can't work more.  My boyfriend does that with me the next day and I always feel like a jerk. (ya know until the next time i'm annoyed lol)|`|jy47TEVkaa	You were kind of rude to him by making the comment,  "how can you go on a trip if you only work 2 days week for 5 hours both days".<br>  <br>  So he got defensive and made a comment back.  You threw him not working much in his face first.   <br>  <br>  Perhaps the two of you were not quite ready for marriage.|`|4zu47qncaa	think of it as your 5 years old and in the sand box why youd little billy throw sand at you, maybe he likes you|`|fxRzY81Waa	Well, you did have a point in your comment, but from a guy's point of view, a question like that could sound like a 'why aren't you doing better?' accusation, especially over the phone when they can't see your facial expressions.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like he has a bit of a short fuse with the subject, which makes me think that he's either trying to do better and it's not working out (extremely frustrating), or he's used to the amount of work he does and is also used to criticism of it (also extremely frustrating).  Either way, if he's supporting you, he should be doing better.  Maybe a vacation sounds like a good idea for 'unwinding time' for the both of you, but I think some understanding, open communication, honesty with feelings, and fair grounds for calm questions should be implemented first.  'Throwing stuff in my face' is not something a fiance should have to say about their significant other, and I think it would do you both some good to have a good sharing conversation.<br>  <br>  In the grand total, if you really want to know the answer to your question, you need to be able to talk with him, not the Internet.  Can't rely on the advise of strangers for ever, especially if you expect to be married to him for years and years and years.  ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RDWVoc9Naa	why cant you work??  cause ur depressed!! maybe getting a job may help you!!!<br>  <br>  he probebly didnt like been shut down like that.. he is aloud to dream and what you should of said was 'thats a great idea maybe u can get extra work and u can save to go'|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	He's a jerk.

He is upset that you are trying to tell him how to spend his money.  This will become a huge problem after you are married as he will feel that the money is his and he can spend it as he pleases.  Before you get married, you will have to create a budget that will include rent, food, utilities, entertainment, transportation, etc. and then decide how to split the money that is left into savings and pocket money.  It may be necessary for him to work full time and, if possible, you may have to work.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	Sounds like you were the one that brought it up that he doesn't have a full time job.

d0WQ2pZNaa	I think you should give girls another chance, or at least not put up with bad behavior, because just because some aren't as intelligent as you or have the different view points, or like people for different reasons from what you would, doesn't mean they deserve to get beaten and bashed.<br>  If girls are letting guys hit them around, yes it may be their fault, but you really don't know what is going on in their lives or why they may not be doing something about the situation themselves.  <br>  Also, with women in your past that have turned you down and not giving you a chance, maybe its because you were choosing the losers? and instead of punching the crap out of you, they turned you down, which is pretty much a punch in the heart ay? (i would know) But do you think you deserved it? no, maybe you were just picking the wrong women because not all women are going to turn you down, there are many that will jump to the opportunity to be with you<br>  <br>  But just think of it, imagine if a woman who didn't like you got with you, and while you were madly in love with her she went and had an affair with somebody else, it isn't because you deserved it, its purely because you picked the wrong girl for you, a girl who didn't respect you.<br>  Now you may think, 'yeah thats my point, those women are choosing the losers so thats what they get'. but many people are blind to what is really going on, and even though the guys they are with treat them like cr.ap, many of them are insecure and think that they may as well stay with them because its the best they will get. because so many have such a low self esteem.<br>  Now you sound like you know you're better than that, and yourself and other people shouldn't have to put up with that sh.it, but lots of people aren't in that head space yet and they cant think that logically, but that doesn't mean they should get hit for it.<br>  <br>  Try to see it as you know better and help those who are in bad relationships, help themselves.|`|C5bhtFXpaa	It seems to me like you're a very bitter and resentful person. The only way you can get over your hatred of women is to date one....... BUT No girl is going to want to date you since you obviously have some kind of baggage that has emotionally scarred you in some way and made you how you are. Take care of yourself first, then focus on finding a girl.|`|ZJB24VtRaa	That is a horrible attitude to have. You can't blame all women because of some. You should always help girls who are getting beaten up. How would you feel if that was someone kin to you and no one wanted to help. You have the chance to be the bigger person and do what is right. So get over it and forgive women!|`|wuiUMN6paa	dude on some waaaay reallness u need help how could u watch things like that n not be affected. thats weird n hateful ive never heard anything like that wow get some help!!|`|M35jwgTSaa	i guess you just have that now. Maybe you'll get over it when someone you actually care about is getting beaten. Pretty messed up that you didnt help those girls but it happened. Your right about how stupid it is to allow themselves to be treated like **** besides how many times can a white knight show up to save them? Sometimes people just have to save themselves. It sucks that the women you've come across have tainted your perception of a sex but damage done. I guess the only way you can get over it is if a girl your actually care about comes along and changes all that for you and it'll happen eventually. Life has a way of sneaking things up on you. Just kind of try and not be so angry, how about giving women another chance? By the way not all women are that stupid to like jerks, believe me some of us actually like being treated like human beings and not animals. Good luck with your hatred.|`|rWQaXqlhaa	woah dude calm down<br>  im an 18 yo guy whose never had a gf<br>  i feel your pain too<br>  but i really want a hot gf and that overcomes my dislike of how the players get them all the time<br>  even tho i feel sad im hoping i can get a gf soon enough|`|lK3TXGBOaa	woooow i cant believe you just said that....WOOOOW!!!! omg.... okay....? i can see the hatred you have for these girls omg for crying out loud how could you not help the girl that was getting beat up in the car by her bf OMG and the other girl that left the keys in the car ...<br>  <br>  - seriously you need to seek help go to some psychiatrist because any normal person would have helped these two girls thats just ****** up...<br>  <br>  - im still shocked..........|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	You saw two different women getting abused and you didn't help when you could have!?! That's despicable! And women often get TRAPPED in those kinds of relationships! They don't always know the kind of person they are with until its too late and they are scared of leaving! Just because a few women have turned you down doesn't mean you should condemn all women. Your never going to get a date if your a jerk and hate women! Women will hate you right back!<br>  <br>  Seeing women get beat and not doing something while you had the chance should be criminal negligence.|`|Ll3Qt8Wyaa	A lot of the time when you meet someone, they arent like that (abusive).

For those who chose bad boys, i have no sympathy.<br>  <br>  As for own afflictions, you need to get over anger. Perhaps to talk to a professional? Maybe YOU are choosing hte wrong women? And that is why you dont have sucess with them. I guess it isnt your place to step in a situation b/n 2 ppl, but it wouldnt hurt considering your size would it? I mean what if it were your sister? or mother/grandmother, aunt or whoever? Would you want someone to way by that could have easily helped?|`|QLiNak0Naa	women are difficult to understand. we like jerks but not complete jerks. at the same time we also like someone who is soft and compassionate. i dunno, i thing you probably dont have the looks and thats why you keep getting rejected or you might be socially awkward. its not the women's fault. just like you guys, we care about looks too. but again you might be at a age where girls around you care more about looks than personality. i suggest dont be a jerk. maybe if you would've showed some respect for those women you saw, they would start thinking different about you and even tell their friend about you defending them. women love that. all i am saying is be yourself. my biggest advise to getting women is talk to them flirt with them make them think you like them and than ignore them for a while and than start oding it again. confuse them, but dont hurt their feelings and dont do it to a point where they get sick of you!|`|zka26204aa	Yes, I think you should spend the rest of your life miserable.  Obviously, you don't have an ounce of humanity in you, so you deserve to be miserable!!!<br>  <br>  I can tell by your question exactly why you can't get a date.  It is your attitude.  Get some therapy, and maybe someone will be able to get through that wall of anger and hate you have built up in you head.<br>  <br>  Honestly, you need help.
DqTU7sZwaa	Are you sure you really love him? I've had about 4 guys in my life I thought I REALLY loved. I'm 24 and started dating when I was 16. I really don't believe love is one sided. It's a mutual feeling you share and experience together. If you do not feel you get the affection you deserve then it's time to move on. I know a lot of comments on here are going to say just leave him. It's going to hurt, and it will take a little time to get over him. But there's no point in wasting anymore time if you are not happy or share that feeling of oblivious love. You deserve to have the affection and devotion you show to him, returned to you. If the only time is when you have sex he expresses his emotions, it's probably things said in the moment to make it more exciting or trying to make more of connection for sexual pleasure. Since he no longer want's to have sex, maybe he wants to see how he feels about you without the sexual emotions. I would see how things might be different. Maybe better, maybe worse. I would stay on guard though. If a guy want's to stop having sex their probably a reason behind it besides finding the feelings he may have for you. Accept his decision. If you are still not happy with the affection he gives for you, try to talk to him about it, if still nothing and your still not happy. Move on.|`|TvRQkU29aa	if u spend 2 much tme wit ech otha then u need 2 gve ech otha sum space sumtmes.

But from you situation it seems like your bf only wants sex and not love.  How can you love someone if YOU fell like they don't love you back??

lA6lk50Qaa	If you guys have been dating for 2 years and you love each other enough to get married, then it should be as short or long as you feel is comfortable.<br>  <br>  I was married once before to a man that I had know for about 3-4 years we married about 2 years after we got together and all of our family encouraged it. It all ended VERY badly. <br>  <br>  We divorced and I then met my current husband.  <br>  <br>  My current husband and I knew each other for about 1 week before we moved in together, for about 1 month before we got engaged and we were married before we had been together for 12 months. Our family and friends told us that we were moving to fast and we didn't know each other well enough etc.<br>  <br>  We are still just as happy now as we ever were.<br>  <br>  The point of this story is that nobody but you and your fiance know whats appropriate for you, both times family and friends were wrong. So you should do what feels right for the both of you and not whats considered "appropriate" to everyone else.<br>  <br>  Best wishes for your future, I hope you will both be as happy as us.|`|8P8aSx0daa	Most people make the mistake of getting engaged before even knowing there future partner.  While being engaged, let that time be the time to make sure that what you are doing is going to be final.  A marriage is a sacred bond and should never be broken.  People who divorce are immature and impatient.  Once you are ready to take the final steps and get married, then the time will come for you two to make a date and finally tie the knot.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Two years.

But how long is best depends on the individuals involved, and the length of relationship before engagement.|`|X8C9Zwj9aa	I think time won't be a big deal if you're having an engagement. The important thing is you love each other and you're willing to be with each other as long as you want.

Go out and find the guy that sweeps you off of your feet with his kisses, the guy that makes your heart pound with lust when you see him, the guy that makes you laugh and smile constantly. Don't settle for trying to force it work with this guy just because he's above average. Mr. Right will come along eventually, and he is so much more than above average. : )
53748744cddefdf672838d27d8300662aa	Across time and geography marriage has come in a wide variety of forms and served a number of functions.  Its most basic function, no matter the form it might take, is to provide a stable environment within which to raise children.  It has also served as a social and/or political 'glue' to bind alliances, and therefore some level of resource sharing, between families, factions, even nations.  When one or more wives are required to cleave only to one husband, it provides the means by which men can be reasonably assured that they are expending resources to raise only their own offspring.  This concept is very important in patrilineal cultures, but less so in matrilineal cultures, wherein a man's sisters' children are the ones that carry on the family line.<br>  <br>  The concept that a man and a woman ought to be soul mates, lovers for life, is a fairly recent one, and is still regarded by many cultures as an impossible, foolish, childishly romantic, and therefore, dangerously impractical one.  When parents in those cultures arrange a marriage they hope that the couple will come to love one another (as they often do), but they content themselves with choosing for their children spouses who will be civil, perhaps kind, fertile, good providers (usually but not always men),  good wives and mothers (women), and who will bring a bit of land or livestock, a useful skill, wealth, status, or influence along with them with which to improve or maintain the lot of the families into which they marry.  Even in cultures where people freely choose their own marriage partners based heavily on romantic love, parents will try their best to steer their children -- for their own good, of course --  toward potential mates who appear to represent these values and away from those who don't.<br>  <br>  To continue to exist, societies require that children be raised to conform -- more or less -- to its norms, whatever those might be. The most basic unit of any society, then, is one form or another of the  child-rearing family, not the individual, not even the deliriously happy couple; therefore, societies encourage families.  Marriage is traditionally the first step toward starting a family; therefore, societies encourage marriage.  One current means of doing this in the U.S. is to provide preferential access to various financial benefits, such as tax deductions or the spousal insurance that you deride. These benefits may be new in form, but they are not new in concept.  These "add-ons" replace or augment more traditional resources.  In a time and place where romantic love supplants many, although perhaps not all, practical considerations in re marriage, they assist families, hence the society, to survive.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	Marriage is the molding of a man and a woman into one so that they<br>  will be the lasting bond of that marriage and it will become so strong<br>  that no one can break the mold, and married for 22yrs, and my parents<br>  having been married for 55yrs, is proof that marriage still exist and is<br>  strong, especially when two people continuously work at it and insure<br>  that is stays that way.|`|b30zbnqPaa	i agree with your definition, as well as the fact that it is supposed to show devotion to each other. <br>  <br>  but i'm a bit against marriage myself. i think it takes more to stay with someone for the rest of your life out of sheer will and not because your legally bonded to them.|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	your answer is what GOD intended it for.

Yes, in Christianity and Judaism, it allows a couple to have sex with one another, but in today's society, that is pretty much what it has become.  It is merely a "I want your life insurance" or what have you.  Most people do not see it as forever, unfortunately, but religiously, Marriage is a spiritually binding contract that ties one man to one woman until "death do [them] part."

" or "hi, my name's...."    and see what facial expressions you make too. <br>  sometimes people don't realize what they look like when they talk. and that's half the battle.<br>  <br>  Tip #2 try to make eye contact with the person your talking too. that helps. for example if your in class and the teacher calls on you- you know everyone's going to turn around and look at you... ahhh.. but just look at the teacher's eyes even if their looking somewhere else, there head and answer and try to  be loud  like your confinent and you know ...and it might come out better.|`|99BbbRmGaa	OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDER<br>  =D|`|0ZKV8JAJaa	be confident in what you say. say it loud. say it proud.

He has bi-polar. Can you deal with it? Can you deal with the possible fights due to his bi polar? Will the love out rule the bipolar? These are questions you should ask. He can ask, Can I deal with fighting with the one I love because of a disorder I cannot get rid of?

Tell him that its him you like and you want to start out as friends and see what happens from there. <br>  <br>  Tell the guy that likes you that, blunlty, you don't like him the way that he likes you. you still want to be friends with him, but you aren't physically attracted to him, so let's just keep it friends. If he can't see that you appreciate his friendship more than his dating skills, then he is not a true friend. <br>  <br>  Tru friends see you for you, and know when to back down, or at least after they are told to. <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|16UihYZQaa	You should confront the friend that likes you and ask him if he likes you.

Many victims spousal abuse deny that anything is happening to them. And they usually feel that it's their fault they get hit. Their isn't much you can do, unless you actually see that someone is hitting her. All you can do is talk to her and try to make her tell you the truth.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	i agree with danni b2b  she is being abused physically those are the signs of victims of physical abuse  '' leave me alone'' and  hiding the abuse marks like the bruises  on your moms back.<br>  <br>  it is not hickeys she is being hit by the spouse or someone else<br>  you should be there to help and support her and she needs to get out of the abuse  hit situation|`|V8PjfdkIaa	You bet someone is hitting her.

See if you can get a better look at your mom's back. Try to talk to her. The fact that she replied the way she did, saying; "she would already know", -well, -take a hint, -you already know what really happened. So, you have to decide on the next course of action. This is a highly personal matter; one that will require the utmost finesse, on your part. First thing you should do; (open your MSWord program, and formulate a clear statement, with as much information as you can provide; the date/time, when you saw it; the location, color and size of the bruise(s). Now, if your dad uses the computer you're on, don't save anything he might find. Print the sheet out, and hide it in a secure location. The tough part; waiting.....If it never happens again, let it go. If it does happen again, type out another report. Ask your mom to let you take pictures, -this time-...as evidence of abuse. Like I said, this is tough. Now, call the local Dept. of Social Services help-line. Tell them what is going on, and ask if you should get one-on-one counseling. This is very important, because, if you have to reveal your personal info. -or they send somebody out to "interview" your family, and your dad is home, -or gets wind of the D.S.S. representative's visit, this could trigger a violent response from your dad. So, if you can, go down to the D.S.S. office. If a GOOD family friend already knows what's going on in your home, ask him/her if (s)he will go with you, as backup. Be sure to take the pictures and your "case-notes".  I'm really sorry about your situation, and wish I could be of more help. I'll pray for you, and for its safe and speedy resolution. God Bless You.

I would simply wait it out until it becomes a topic, or until you feel the right moment.  I would also consider telling them one at a time, rather than turning it into a major sit down discussion if you insist on telling them before they start to wonder or get use to the possibility that you may be gay.|`|4T8RTnzCaa	Your family sounds close minded, best to keep it inside if u want to remain a family, but sooner or later they will question y u have no BF etc..., however if u told them they will either reject it or embrace it, personally sounds like they will reject it. Best to find out how come they are angry at gays, and try to ease them into the situation/<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|bdiSM1UXaa	That sounds tough. I would suggest that you get a gay-friendly relative or family friend if you have one to help you through the process of coming out to your parents. I hope everything works out.|`|UiiviOCgaa	that is totally cool!!! i am not a lezbian, but i am gsa all the way (the picture says it all). if you wanna talk, just e-mail me. anyhoo, i would try the telling few other people first. was there anyone at all in your family that was accepting? if there was, i would tell them first since they are likely to be the most supportive. see how that goes. if your parents love you the way that they should, it should be no matter to them. but it should make you feel better finding a couple people who are supportive first and then that would not make you think something is wrong with you because there is not! i am just saying that entering a new world with support would be easier versus getting shunned.|`|54bTmqipaa	They will not like it temporarily but they will still love you.<br>  <br>  ^Typical, touche. If you are independent, it should be a little easier, but if you are still living with them in the same household, things could get complicated. ie. Getting kicked out the house.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck.|`|mA8nadDRaa	i can see that you had decided that you're a lesbian, not the way it turns out.<br>  i think you're not 100% sure what you are.

vwoqIUR6aa	don't take it too harshly. maybe it's because you guys don't work together anymore?? why not call her and catch with her to reestablish your friendship??|`|KXBGhPLhaa	ask her whats up! try to reach out to her like hey hows it goin!|`|auV1uN6Zaa	talk to her about it|`|c36O0naDaa	ask her whats wrong and if everythings ok with family/relationships. She will eventually come round. Tell her that your sorry for whatever youve done.|`|m2eHPeciaa	maybe ur friend went on n forgot about u... its called a buster.. sorry. i've had friends like that before, one day, u think ur all chill, then the next u dont hear from them.|`|HRiwLWpHaa	tell her u miss the old days.. or that if u did something wrong to let u kno.
DcrI9zmkaa	A real friend would never say that...even if he thought it.  It sounds to me like he's jealous.<br>  <br>  My advice?  Let him be.|`|tZUSVuUvaa	Everybody likes different things so you can't really factor your friend's opinion in as far as your girlfriend's appearance goes. Now if he was criticizing her attitude or a hygiene problem, that would be one thing but appearance is nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  My best friend and I have only agreed on two guys in ten years. We have completely different types - she usually thinks that the guys I'm attracted to are ugly and I usually think that the ones she likes are too bland and generic.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Stay with your girl.  What business is his to make such a comments.  If he say something to you again tell him that your girlfriend is the most pretty girl in the whole world and the nicest one, plus you would not change her for any other girl.  You are very lucky.  He seems to be immature and jealous.|`|EXisORX2aa	Good for you!<br>  Maybe he's just jealous because his girlfriend has no lights on in the attic, and your girlfriend does. If you would rather be friends with this guy than go out with your girlfriend, you can dump her and go back to being friends with him. <br>  But it sounds like you really care about her, so I'd suggest you just keep dating your girlfriend, and if he really drops your friendship because of something like that, he wasn't a great friend in the first place.|`|b3YMLS61aa	I have been with really hot girls. you know nice body and all that. but their attitude made them ugly. my current girlfriend isnt as "Hot" as my other one but her personality makes her the hottest girl i have been with. your friend is a douche|`|ISbCiVjGaa	It was a little mean of him to say this, but he is your mate and he is just being st8 with you, you dont have to do what he says but thier aint really much point in falling out with him over it either..|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	pound his face.|`|rHuAhN3iaa	Oh the honesty of friends, we all want it, but sometimes we really wish they kept some things to yourself.<br>  <br>  Your friend was out of line. Period. If he knows that you girlfriend makes you happy, a real friends wouldn't criticize or insult, he would be happy that you are happy. <br>  <br>  Obviously, you want to salvage your relationship and I know guys are weird about talking about their feelings and stuff, but instead of ignoring the situation I think the only way to get past it is to tell him point blank how you feel without getting mushy about. Something like, Listen, I really like <insert girlfriend's name here> and she makes me really happy. I think she's the most beautiful girl in the world, like you think your girlfriend is. You're my friend and I would like to salvage that but if you continue to speak badly about my girlfriend we may have to part ways.<br>  <br>  Your friend was really inconsiderate, so think long and hard about whether your friendship is worth saving before you try to make amends.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ll3Qt8Wyaa	Just let it go, you obvioulsy have differnt outlooks on life and are differnt. You see his true colors and that he is superficial. What he said was very rude, even if he felt that way...|`|22d5af33c05c043b6990ced7809ac661aa	Your "friend" is very superficial and will end up alone. This is the type of thing i would not just 'let go'. Tell him if he cant stand looking at her, then he might as well get used to not seeing your face either.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	your friend is entitled to his own opinion but dont listen to him. stay with your girl as long as you are happy. who cares about what other people think?! if he is indeed a real friend then he should stfu and respect you.|`|zW8tc64qaa	Tell your "friend" that he should jump in a ditch and stay there. You're dating her, not your jerk friend (yes, he is a jerk).|`|lXpGlAm3aa	Tell him to shove it.<br>  <br>  That is why you are with her and not him.Each to their own.|`|x4Irx79Gaa	I think its ur opinion tht matters.<br>  look just tlk to him and say tht was really stupid what u said or watevs and yeee . <br>  <br>  i think its soo great u think ur gf has natural beauty|`|uRbeSOMwaa	STAY WITH HER. <br>  dont listen to your friend|`|dOTDydkhaa	He can't be much a friend to hurt you like that. Think of what is more important your friend or your girlfriend. My boyfriend likes my imperfections, and without makeup and wearing comfortable clothes. But when i dress up with my friends to go clubbing and look hot he thinks i don't look like 'his girlfriend'. Make sure your girlfriend knows you love her. It is very much important to let her know how much she means to you. It is more important to feel happy in a relationship than how your friend thinks you look. He sounds very shallow. You need to be a man and do what's right!!|`|Pr2eOhliaa	you love her you say, so just let it go.<br>  if you miss your friend, which im sure you do. try to talk to him about it<br>  tell him you think she is beautiful and you love her no matter what. ask him if he would dump HIS girlfriend just because you thought she was ugly.|`|Dc4C1pr0aa	Obviously he is not a really good friend then if he has to insult your girlfriend. Just don't even talk to him if he's going to talk about your girlfriend. Or simply tell him this it's either you quit saying **** about my girlfriend or we stop being friends. Simple as that.|`|KU0C99muaa	don't let him get to you, he probably just said it today, normally when someone says something rude, it kind of sticks in your head for a day or two. be happy that you have a great girl and not some butterface ;] haha.|`|DwiQ66qyaa	You tell him she's pretty to you when casually talking...don't try to lecture...everyone has their own opinions<br>  <br>  please help me<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aubj.960j_UpwCDoEdyhgKnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309224237AAESNIU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ddQ7bmhNaa	Ya dont.

6hJ5IM2Eaa	She looks you in the eyes! She asks about you, like what are your interests and hobbies. She evaluates your reactions to questions and answers you have. She touches you in ways that make your tummy tickle! She tells you she wants to see you again. She goes out of her way to see you or talk to you. She giggles at your jokes. A lot of things could say a girl likes you. Just look for them and ask her!|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	She touches him a lot, like on the arm or the back. <br>  She compliments him or says his name a lot.<br>  She either puts off a ditzy or tough persona that he knows isn't the real her.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	When she says "I do"... :)|`|ZJB24VtRaa	she makes eye contact when talking to him. she touches him on the arm or back. she tries to get close to him. she acts ditsy or something that totally isn't the real her. she laughs at his jokes even if they aren't funny. she stares at him from across the room.|`|AA12300280	eye contact, making a point to talk to you, touch you, etc.  Smiling, laughing at your jokes that aren't necessarily funny.  <br>  <br>  body language is a huge thing.

AA11305351	As an older lady-friend of mine said once, "Oh, I'm done with all that foolishness(sex)". Your wife is saying she wants to continue your marriage, but NO sex. She is finished with all that "foolishness". Is that what YOU want ? |`|nqINitkmaa	Shes just losing her sex drive it happens as women get older, its normal I'm sure she will get it back. If it is something that is very important to you, ( that you have sex ) then sit down and talk to her about it and tell her how you feel, she may understand and try to do things to get her sex drive back, if she doesn't then you'll have to respect that. Good Luck!|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It means that she is frigid. She needs to see a doctor to find out if there is a physical reason for her decreased libido. Perhaps it's just a hormonal imbalance.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	it means she is giving you permission to go outside the marriage to satisfy your sexual cravings|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Don't know.... only she can answer that one.|`|Fw94nmbBaa	OMG ..............i am in the same situation but i am a girl and my husband feels that way ......WTF....right! |`|ikXRqWxUaa	i would go to counseling together.  the fact that she has a low sex drive might be emotional/hormonal/physical.  the problem is...if you have a normal sex drive, that lack on intimacy is going to drive you to do something bad.  remember, people...you don't have to worry when your partner is asking for sex.  you have to worry when they stop asking you for sex.|`|aIgNU5PUaa	She is reassuring you that shes not having an affair or even thinking about having an affair (because that is what folks think when the sex is missing).  Its good she said in-love as well as love because they are two different things.  Try to find out why she doesn't want sex, maybe her self image is shot.  Help her feel sexy and maybe she will surprise you.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Is she on birth control or any other medications that may deplete the sex drive?<br>  Is intercourse physically painful to her?<br>  <br>  If you can answer no to either question, then I would say she is manipulating you into staying with her.|`|AA10874773	it means she loves you & wants to be with you forever, but she doesn't want sex.  definitely not a Pisces, lol.  if this is new for her, she may just need to go to the dr & get on meds.  good luck!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	What is that?  I don't get it!  I'm 33 and my husband is 37 and I am still totally in love with him - couldn't imagine not including the sex in that equation.  Strange...sounds like you need to ask her why.|`|c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	It means she's running low on the male hormone. Ask her if she'll go to the doctor and ask for medication or hormone replacement.<br>  <br>  It has nothing to fault yourself or her about. It's medical.<br>  <br>  Take care,.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	It means you've got probably another 40 years to go without.|`|OzREW683aa	the omly person that knows that answer is your wife....good luck|`|gG6oaRICaa	I would say that she is being upfront and honest enough with you to tell you exactly how she feels.  <br>  Turn it the other way around.....although she does not want sex, she loves you, and only wants you.<br>  The question i'd be asking myself is, am I happy to have that level of commitment without sex?  If you are, then thats great....make the most of what you've got together.  <br>  If not, then you've got to sit down and tell how YOU feel, because at your ages, you've a long life ahead of you without the closeness and enjoyment that sex can bring.|`|Xk10tIISaa	Maybe she loves you and only wants to be with you and wants you to know that she doesn't want to have sex, but wants to reassure you that she is not getting it elsewhere. She's just lost passion. But you need to talk with her because regardless of what others say SEX is crucial to a relationship.|`|AA10662866	my thoughts fror what its worth is that she may feel that she isnt getting anything out of sex, maybe she feels you are just using her.<br>  <br>  Could be a physical thing, maybe it hurts<br>  <br>  TALK to her ask her to be honest, and you be honest with her.|`|4340dd3743e9f37aef4418dec2bdbb8aaa	This means she is insecure about her body and/or her sexuality. Woman respond to mental stimulation more than physical... try to get her softened up by talking/ intriguing her in something non-sexual. Good Luck!|`|ibeVcQyWaa	Damn, that's a hard one.  Ask HER this, nobody knows the answer but her.|`|euN3ct9oaa	Take her to the doctor. |`|kXcjuEqGaa	she loves you but isn't sexually attracted to you|`|aF1tqNdXaa	It means you are going to be whacking off a lot|`|8CQgghpDaa	well....now if u want it thats a prob.<br>  <br>  ask her why!<br>  just talking could help!
K8t1lPXsaa	i doubt he would still be hung up on an ex that long. especially from when he was so young. don't worry about it and don't make a big deal out of it. i'm a guy and i'm actually friends with most of my exes but i don't think of them in *that* way anymore. |`|yIdwMPsoaa	I understand if your worried .. just talk to him about it. <br>  Communication is an important part of a relationship. If he loves you, he'll understand how you feel and he'll reassure you.|`|E5IktYWMaa	Just don't act like you don't trust him.  Just keep an eye out, and if he starts flirting or something he shouldn't be doing, pull him aside and talk to him. Hopefully everything works out for you!!|`|YorMkZYAaa	Unless he's given you real reason to worry, then let it go. You said they haven't spoken in a long time so more than likely it's a strictly platonic meeting. Stop fretting and don't be so insecure.|`|86NQlLAOaa	I'd be worried...<br>  But you never know when they might just be talking, not getting 'together' again. Ask if you can go along.|`|NnPJI27jaa	yes you should be worried|`|AA11284366	somewhat.|`|0NQYiAIcaa	They were 15. Truthfully, there's a world of a difference between 15 and 19...they've both changed so much, and probably didn't know what love was when they were 15. But, if he feels you aren't nice and appreciative enough, you should ask him why, and try to understand why he feels that way...understanding is the key. But, honestly, past loves are a big deal. At least to me. If "the one that got away" ever worked his way back into my life, my husband would have reason to be very worried.|`|53Ar6Hbgaa	yeah because theres a chance that he may like her again. BUT don't act on it so quick|`|8VqLPE7laa	uh oh<br>  <br>  he wants to dump you
AA10529674	If you want to get over him, don't talk to him, don't call, text or email him. Don't have any contact with him at all whatsoever. It may take a long time for you to get over him, but not having any contact with him makes it way easier.|`|c6oobrlAaa	Listen to music C= <br>  Hang out with your friends...<br>  Just do sumthing other than cry about it..<br>  He isnt worth it|`|EAYv4SCXaa	hmm.... i am in a similiar situation......yes, of course its hard to let a person go when you spent so much time with them. But just think of all the ways he has hurt you.....how much that affects you everyday....how much time you are losing ........ I am in a similiar situation: i choose to move on with my life one way or another. It'll be hard but what's not hard in life? Just think: there is something so much better out there waiting for you!!!!!!! Good luck!

While time past by, I was hanging out with friends male and female. And next thing you know he was hardly on my mind. I mean still loved him but I didn't stress over it as much.<br>  <br>  And sooner or later, he'll want you back. It's a known experience and me and bf are now fine.<br>  Don't Worry.

Hc0S70fkaa	kissing is simple,Just as your about to kiss Just slightly open your mouth.(not too wide though)  then your partner will do the same(if he knows how to ..)  then slightly insert your tongue(if he does) and barely suck it as he do the same..good luck!!|`|4Qv79VSmaa	ok this happens to everyone at one point in time. the thing you don't want to do is make it known you have no idea what your doing. guys tend to think different about that. the best thing to do is get comfortable before going in for a kiss. relaxing is a key point, if your relaxed and not as nervous you'll be fine. but here's a good tip. just give a little hug then look your friend in the eyes and then slowly lean in, if the guy really likes you and leans in as well then just take it slow and i'm certain your mind will tell your lips what to do. well i hope that helps.|`|PmYDAzsNaa	Its simple.... just make you lips meet make it last about 5 seconds, I thought I was a bad kisser at first kissed a guy, but when I called him he said it was fun and that me and my sis weren't bad kissers! (Spin the bottle were in the same grade!)|`|mq0pI8GFaa	well, i would read 'angus, thong and perfect snogging'<br>  It has a few stuff bout it.<br>  <br>  I would also close your eyes when snoggin, otherwise it aint a proper kiss, it kinda like a grans one!|`|3f3af6f34bb88921eca061991093216faa	You can bite the lip, but i recommend that you alternate sucking on his top and bottom lips.  I promise it will get better as you start to get more comfortable!  Good luck!|`|jHgKEJivaa	Be yourself.<br>  And when your kissing, make sure your breath smells nice.<br>  And put on lovely tasting lipstick lol.<br>  Good luck.|`|wCxwc1XQaa	ok kid 1st put ur lips like your about 2 kiss but relax them ay the same time.<br>  <br>  next;when your lip makes contact always make sure they are soft.<br>  <br>  then;if you want put your toung out a little but only if he does his.|`|Tz0izRplaa	make sure you dont drool everywhere, make sure you swallow back the spits, or it might get ugly, |`|h5PZtTDhaa	Slow down, breathe and take it easy!

I remember my first kiss, was so bad.  I almost sucked the guys face off.....don't do that lol.  Small little kisses are best, then using your tongue a little.  Maybe rest your hands on his shoulders or maybe one on his shoulder and the other behind his head.  Takes practice you'll get better....everyone does!|`|sVg4Qco0aa	I worried a lot too, and looked for advice on line. But once I stopped worrying and being nervous and just let things happen everything turned out great.|`|H52XNJFtaa	Just relax.

And he should have a little more respect for your relationship and not be texting her all the time. |`|MczmTftTaa	yeah you do, your boyfriend is playing two sisters|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes you have a right but i think ur bf likes your sister more!|`|fcY0c8NJaa	Hey, you definently have a right to feel like this. However for the fact that your sister doesnt know the two of you are together i think your bf is mostly at fault here. He should not be texting another girl that much whether she is your sister or not. What could he possible have to say to txt that much?? If i was you i wuld try to find out what these messages are saying, r u sure there isn't anything further going on? You need to sort your bf out and tell him that its un acceptable for him to be talkin to your sister that much, and tell him he needs to stop it. Let him know youe not happy and put a stop to it before you loose him to your sister. Good luck:)|`|R0M1WCmZaa	oh my god! that's mistake! she should not texting to your boy-friend tell her that she is your sister, she should let you use her phone so you can talk to your boyfriend, tell her stop flirty with your boyfriend, that's so mistake! I would be very mad if I was you.........|`|7nzIRFZkaa	Yes. Sorry, honey, but it looks like he's just using you to get to her. Dump him, you deserve better.|`|qbzbYQqZaa	Definitely. Talk to your boyfriend or break up with him.|`|SEMYH5Ccaa	obviously, HES YOUR BOYFRIEND.<br>  text your boyfriend more than she does<br>  and just be extra fliirrtty<br>  talk to him about it|`|Ewp79kMIaa	I'd be pisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssed|`|hHCEi4peaa	hellyea i would beat her ***|`|bouDIMjmaa	wow that really sux i'd talk to ur boyfriend about it first|`|dDk4A957aa	You have a right to feel like this. He is too young to understand your emotions, but at the same time he seems old enough to flirt with your sister and try two-timing on you. I bet, if time will allow him, he will go to the extend of proposing to her. Dump this guy, if you can, and find a more sensible boy. In future, it will be a good idea to keep your sister away from your boyfriend, until you are sure he respects your feelings. I am sure, your boyfriend wouldn't stand you texting his brother too, so why are you? Good luck.|`|6ikj2tGRaa	Firstly,<br>  Why dont you want your parents to know?<br>  And if your bf really liked you he wouldnt be saying anything out of the odinary to your sister. Maybe your bf is giving her the wrong idea without meaning to, you should confront him about it. You DO have a right to feel jealous, but you can't really blame your step-sister because she does not KNOW that you are going out....<br>  So good Luck :)|`|KEUFAR7waa	It sounds to me like ur boyfriend has feelings for your sister too otherwise he wouldn't be texting her back so much, I'd talk to your boy and ask him whats going on. <br>  <br>  Its no fair on you or your sister that he's playing the both of you. Thats just rude & untrustworthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|CkSiX4Yuaa	you have all the rights to feel like that you boyfriend shouldn't be txt your sister at all the only thing you can do is tell your boyfriend how you feel about him txt her all night long and tell him to stop txt her so much|`|oWtDt5WNaa	tell your boyfriend- if you cant talk to her, the best thing you can do is make him stop, and dont tell her why. i would hate that!|`|WVpwgJOraa	first of all y is ur bf txting ur sister if he is so call ur bf y does ur step sister have his number i say dump him he must be tawkin 2 her in dat way dat she says she's in love with him and u r not rong for feeling that wayy|`|iWzQd6wKaa	Don't blame your sister, she doesn't know. Just dump the guy but tell your sister the truth about it because he's a cheater.|`|Fclpba8Qaa	yeah shes in love with him.<br>  <br>  and it sounds like he is in love with both you and your sister.<br>  <br>  maybe try and work out a 3some?|`|FS8AH01Maa	the real question is y the hell is your boyfreind texting your 15 year old step sister, and how did they get eachothers numbers if they've never met|`|CkQmOH3aaa	Talk to your boyfriend, best thing you can do.|`|eUlIRHsMaa	Of course you have a right to be jealous... you should give  your boyfriend an ultimatum: her or you... being single is better than being jealous. |`|FKo9cdQkaa	of course you do!!! i mean your sister and your bf? i would so totally strangle her! well maybe not strangle but you know what i mean.|`|4E1j0Mgzaa	oh honey they are digging each other! i'm sorry but you need to give it up! find a new guy and quit introducing your men to her!|`|KWWU4ajzaa	yes! TELL YOUR SISTER THAT YOUR GOING OUT WITH HIM,<br>  AND IF SHE SAYS ILL TELL MOM, THEN SAY WELL ILL TELL MOM ____BLAH BLAH BLHA. and tell your bf "wtf? why are u txting my sister"|`|6abf7247a5dd56b3ba99929911e1314faa	No, she's not in love with him.|`|8qnmMJNXaa	Why is your boyfriend texting your sister? I would have said something after the very first text, I don't know why you've put up with this for so long. The fact that he's never met her just makes the whole thing even weirder.<br>  The guy sounds like a creep. I'd brake up with him.<br>  But if you just want her out of the way then maybe you could tell on her, since you said she would tell on you if she had the chance, then why not do it to her? Tell your parents all about her "secret boyfriend" that she talks to late at night. They probably won't let her talk to him anymore and you have nothing else to worry about.|`|ABvFJ0OCaa	Uh, I wouldn't go out with him. He seems to be interested in your girlfriend.|`|PBimvam5aa	talk to youre boyfriend he shouldnt do that thats just rude|`|LH2crXjxaa	of course you have the right to..just talk to your boyfriend about it n he'll stop. best of luck|`|VjsXNhnfaa	stab her while she sleeps|`|gRQjTohHaa	dump his sorry ***! and punch her in the face, what a B I T C H geez i tell u girls need to grow up! u should do that to anyone<br>  |`|1daaH19qaa	In my opinion, I don't think he has truly has affections for your step-sister. If I were you I would maybe try to check up on their messages just to get an idea what they are talking about... It could be him getting some sort of information about you or something.<br>  <br>  If your step-sister claims that she has fallen for him especially when they have yet to meet, I doubt that they would have a 'thing' going on. Maybe try to hint to your boyfriend that you are jealous whenever he spends extensive amounts of time to your step-sister when he should spend a bit more time onto you.<br>  <br>  But this is just my opinion, you should know him better than me. Usually what you feel inside of you is true.|`|oNP3tg6Zaa	Your feelings are common, many people to friends may try to hide the true feelings.  In this case you can't really hide your feelings because you have to hide the fact that he is your boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  How did she get his number and how did he get her number?  I'm assuming you used her phone and that's how it all started.  So this is  your lesson if something similar like this occurs, don't use her phone.<br>  <br>  As for this issue you need to talk to him about how you really feel, don't tell him he can't text her because if you tell him that he will still text her.  Just let him know that it bothers you.

Personally I like a man with big hands, my house mate is a guy and I noticed that he has really feminine hands.  I'm not attracted to him but if he was a nice guy then the size of his hands wouldn't matter. If you are a nice guy, girls won't worry about your hands, and if they are bothered about it, they're not worth it anyway.|`|AA12191000	You're being paranoid - women don't really worry about these things.

V0oETSHqaa	I think she's testing you to see just how much you like her.  You should send her flowers anonymously and watch what she does.  Chicks DIG that!|`|r4MdxTpUaa	you told your story .. you didn't ask!<br>  Nice story,by the way ;o)|`|mv3MzzBJaa	No I don't think she fancies you. Sounds like she talks to you just to be pleasant, and perhaps cos her friend likes you. <br>  <br>  Walking passed you not saying hi and not giving you her number.

Oh, crushes are so fickle.|`|ZW8b76ppaa	Just ask her out the worst that can happen is her saying no and if she talks to you she obviously likes you a little bit just continue to be yourself and talk to her and be real nice and things will turn out just fine.|`|eHbQ4lxDaa	It's because its too bloody long - get rid of the details, get rid of the names and places and times and don't tell us what the trinkets are just call them gifts and summarise and abridge and then someone will read it in its summarised hypothetical form and give you a rough answer which may help.|`|v2hKMwoOaa	She likes you she is just afraid to show it.

She may be shy, why don't you try talking to her more?  When you see her at least say hi or whats up or something.  If you two end up chatting great if not at least she knows you are trying.  Give it a couple weeks and then see if she wants to hang out sometime out of school.  By then you will know each other a little bit more and she may be more willing to open up.|`|Tbq6SMHZaa	I am assuming that you want to know if she likes you. i think she does like you or she is a flirt and just wants you to think she likes you. you people need to stop asking these questions.we are not mind readers. we don't know if this person likes you or not. ask her out if you want to, but don't post another question saing "should i ask her out?!?!?" it is annoying. sorry if you like when people ask these questions. i don't.|`|xDThEMqKaa	i don't know what the question is?<br>  wanna go out with her and you dont know how to ask?<br>  <br>  JUST ASK HER THEN.<br>  <br>  Your question is so not clear...|`|zZlvPkKwaa	sounds like she does but shes afraid so ide ask her be straight with her tell her u like her let her no how u feel dont scare her away though just tell her shes beautiful and funny or wat else you think but get to no each other ok?|`|BCUNioUvaa	well i think she likes u cuz when i like a boy i always point at him when i like them so i think u should get to know her a lil better and ask her out|`|Bi1zusbWaa	Dude, she definitely digs you.

Playing the Hi game or you didn't say hi to me is way too much trouble!   Next time you see her, ask her point blank! is she or is she not interested, in getting to know you.  We waste to much time playing silly games when all we need to do is open up our mouths and speak.|`|vXzaeXFuaa	I am not sure what grade you are in, but trust me from experience.  This girl only wants to be your friend, for now.  If you have noticed, she pays more attention to you when you give her "space".  That is when she is more apt to come seek you out.  <br>  <br>  The fact that she has told her "her friend" thinks you are cute, is a hint that she is okay with the fact that you are with someone else.  I believe that is a big tip that she is cool just being your friend.  Perhaps if you start acting that you are not interested in her, she will seek you out further.<br>  <br>  If you do not know who her friend is that thinks you are cute, ask her.  If you do know who she is, ask if she has a boyfriend.  If you already know that, ask where she lives.  Do you get what I mean?  Say anything to make a girl think you are interested in someone else, and they will nearly attack you (in a good way) if they have any interest in you at all.<br>  <br>  Let me know how it goes (you can contact me from my email link).<br>  <br>  John
EU0l0r0Daa	you shouldnt of loose trust in him if your not sure, but no you werent wrong for txtin tht girl, some girls just need to be told to back off|`|lObEjUh1aa	it sounds like you caught someone else trying to make a move on your boyfriend (i think -- the whole "cousin's friend" thing makes it a bit unclear what you mean).  in any case, as far as you know your boyfriend did not encourage this girl, so you have to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  i hate to say it, but if you lose trust in your boyfriend based on what someone else did (not based on anything he has done), then the problem is yours.  it sounds like you are very insecure, and those insecurities are eroding the trust in your relationship.  here are some positive things you can do to help combat insecurity:<br>  <br>  1.  recognize and take ownership of responsibility for your insecurities (you will never get past them as long as you believe they are his responsibility).<br>  2.  try to understand the causes of your insecurities.<br>  3.  write down some specific actions you can take to relieve your insecurities and increase your confidence level.<br>  4.  do the things on your written list.<br>  5.  review your results and return to step one.<br>  <br>  i know that advice is pretty vague, but short of hiring a professional counselor, it will be hard for you to get more specific advice.  i hope this helps; good luck!|`|tCNcSA0Oaa	either stay with him or move on...dont hold it over his head because it will do nothing but chase him away|`|j0WcDLKqaa	sending pics to a guy is a really trashy thing to do. so by you telling her that i think u did the right thing. and when ever u feel something isn't right talk to him bout it. don't keep it from him. that isn't good and later on it could cause problems. so just sit down and talk to him. if he really loves u he will understand.|`|KqWk8CVWaa	keep hope and faith in him... remember the good times you had and dont let some little girl get in the middle of yous 2 dont accuse him of cheating thats the wrong thing to do unless you have some solid proof because of how long yous been together this isnt going to be the only time you run into problems like this with him  just drop it|`|vVsiMT3Baa	try to keep tabs on him and tell him make sure that he knows what he is going to lose if he doesnt stop<br>  but the girl sending him pics is really trashy and i think you did the right thing<br>  = ]|`|n2W3F7fzaa	your jealous,<br>  your insecure<br>  and its really sad that everyone second guesses there realtionships|`|1c110e772ca0d80e173f660913461094aa	Stop being crazy.

dw440Lylaa	She probably noticed you showing interest in her.<br>  <br>  You need to be very careful, and respect the fact she's dating someone else.  Otherwise, you become the "other man" she ends up cheating with,..........and if she's willing to cheat with you, why wouldn't she cheat on you?<br>  <br>  Wait until she's single, you can become friends in the meantime<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|kknSPYxKaa	She probally just wanted to get to know you a little better.

You can always improve as a person without loosing who you are.<br>  <br>  For example: someone is funny crazy sweet but they curse constantly and say gross things<br>  <br>  If they elimiated the cursing and the unnecessary comments they are still them... but a better version of themselves <br>  <br>  get it :-)|`|s2B6skkKaa	well, some things should not be said, and thats just the way it is, but with that said, if u feel this is the way u express your self, than a guy that not looking 4 a fake girl will b able 2 see, and this is the reason y young girls date older guys. <br>  so as the saying goes.............<br>  b your self, or u will find your self, by your self,<br>  good luck.
OxnFnyqPaa	You should confront your boyfriend about this and demand an explaination. You deserve one.<br>  And I think it's a kind of cheating, only he doesn't know it is. He thinks it's all friendly and no harm done.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|ft8t98Pnaa	first off... thats what you get for snooping in other peoples busniess.. how would you feel if  he read your emails and went through your stuff?<br>  <br>  secondly... why are you asking us... why dont you ask your boyfriend about the emails.|`|AA10829482	I'd ask him about it.  Its not cheating but its not nice either. . . could the email be fake?  Could he by lying to you?  You won't know until you ask.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Has he written anything similar recently?  Some people don't take relationships too seriously that early on.<br>  <br>  Wait a minute...are you spying on him??|`|WLLvMY3iaa	I don't think you should be reading his messages.  So four months ago he wrote something which he may or may not have really felt, because who really knows with guys.|`|q2hq1jr2aa	talk to him, see if its a mis-understanding<br>  <br>  you will be bale to tell if he's lying or not|`|AsBgZDhVaa	I'd propably ask him if he still thinks the realtionship is "gay." He didnt seem that faithful to you, through that e-mail so I would asume he's probably mr. right now...not mr. right. Even though the relationship was only 2 months old at the time, the fact that he was willing to throw it away for a chance with someone else...i'd personally dump him. Its not like he physically cheated on you...but maybe emotionally hes not that attached and it could possibly be considered a form of cheating. he was trying to hook up with someone else..right?|`|UU3AAlkraa	First I wish to know why your reading his e-mails? maybe there are other trust issues. second if that was four months ago perhaps your relationship has grown stronger in his eyes. I do not think it for anyone but him to judge his devotion for you.|`|P5aO3ebzaa	Well i think you should confront him now. If you guys don't communicate then its just a slow death. But i really sounds like your boyfriends a jerk but i don't know him personally. But don't think you have to be rude just calmly talk and if he think your relationship sucks then try to move on. Break ups are just apart of life.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	oh sweety- how old are you?! men cheat- alot. you have to find that right one. the one thing you dont want is for them to be telling other females that your relationship is going bad!! DUH! leave him and give him no explanation. its none of his business. he'll know what his *** did.|`|UUo7zcoBaa	No, it's not necessarily considered cheating but he DEFINITELY needs to be reprimanded or maybe it would be best if you kicked him to the curb. <br>  <br>  <br>  A man should be PROUD to be with you. ALL THE TIME. ALWAYS.<br>  <br>  <br>  Screw it, kick him to the curb girl. You deserve better.|`|OQF6x5CDaa	does HE know hes in a relationship??  doesnt sound like hes into it...<br>  dont let this dirt bag tarnish your impression about all guys.|`|tIldpr7vaa	yeah thats bad, almost as bad as cheating dump him|`|DpQPsTVfaa	There are  bigger and much better things out there! He is just not taking you or the relationship serious enough! But why now? But its never to late to dump his cheatin ***!|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Keep an eye on that one. although its just pointless flirting with a girl he will never be with, it still makes you feel bad right? I would seriously consider confronting him about it.|`|JZtp1X9Caa	First of all, if you mention you read his e-mail, that'll be the first fight.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't think this relationship isn't going anywhere, talk to him and consider moving on.  How do you know that he's putting any effort into your relationship if his mind isn't into it and would consider going out with other girls?|`|sLzhtgv4aa	When he said that the relationship was going gay it means that he is bored.What he meant by he wished she lived closer was that he would dump you and start dating her if she lived closer. My advice to you is dump this guy and leave him alone. You are going to get your heart broken. When he finds someone better he will dump you in a heart beat. BEWARE!!!|`|1iXvphNYaa	I think if you feel he's playing the field you should cut him from the team and recruit somone whose got more faith in what you have to offer in a relationship. It all depends on how you feel. It's been 6 months now and how are things between you?|`|JEa4gn2Paa	First ask him if he likes you, if he does then yes, it is cheating.  If not then; sorry.  If your last date was over 3 months ago then he might think that you don't like him,if that's the case then he kinda has an excuse.  Ask him out again.|`|oQYcpM73aa	you should probably confront him<br>  although he would probably deny it and come up with some lame excuse, but be honest with him and don't get mad, just ask him if he really feels like that, and tell him how you feel about it|`|x80O2hzBaa	Until you really know that he is or not i wouldn't worry about it until he does do something and just think about the famous saying there's more fish in the sea|`|6eEGXcR5aa	leave his cheatin ***.  he wants attention from other girls. is all it is.  whether or not he would have acted on them...i say he would|`|HAcM88Kpaa	well it sounds like he might consider cheeting on you. fist confront him then go from there.|`|4McxYVhKaa	Ask him what he thinks of your relationship. He may think it's not a serious relationship.|`|AA11400430	sounds like he is just keeping you around for company untill he gets something better.|`|T8Ys6HtSaa	Omg Hun !!<br>  <br>  What a D I C K F A C E!!!!<br>  <br>  Seriously you need to tell him you saw the email and make it clear your not happy about it!! Thats so harsh and stand up for yourself. <br>  <br>  X|`|F3xHiowSaa	stay with him, he might cheat on you|`|WNVt6Eowaa	shouldve confronted him 4 months ago|`|KMRqbKR0aa	well you guys were dating early on when he wrote it but it seems super shady. I am sure you do your share of flirting too.  everyone does it...everyone likes the attention at some level or another...but some people take it too far.  so you should be somewhat guarded.  <br>  <br>  how did you see the e-mail? were you sneaking in his things? if you confront him on it he will never trust you either.  You are in a tough spot....i say if everything is going fine, leave it at that.<br>  <br>  If he is only with you all the time  and not partying without you with  it should be ok...but if he is still writing this girl on myspace/facebook on comments you should take a closer look at your relationship.  Also check to see if he is texting a lot when you guys are out.  if he is writing people you should casually ask who it is...if he is shady secretive about it you should be cautious and look more into it.  and be careful guys will ALWAYS turn it around on you.  even if they are wrong.  stick to your guns and hold your ground...you dont need to be treated like that if so!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kI2VDaivaa	it was over four months ago....if you are happy with your relationship now then just forget it happened....everybody makes mistakes. He obviously doesn't feel the same way now because he is still with you. However, if you feel as though you can't let it go silently...talk to him about it in a very NON-CONFRONTATIONAL way. Most likely he will assure you it was a while ago and he was just being a guy. If this was a recent offense obviously you should handle it differently, but because it was so long ago and he hasn't has any recent offenses....forgive and move on. <br>  <br>  Also, if you do decide to talk to him about it...be prepared to discuss why you were snooping in his email. Its a sticky situation...good luck|`|NVHhVq1aaa	I'm 22 and been married 5 years now. My husband and I have been split up almost 2 years back and forth. I would here things about him and I choose  not to believe them. When found out about a woman he had been having a relationship online for 8 months....WHILE I WAS PREGNANT! I didn't even know this was going on. My own husband who lived with me. I gave him another chance and it happened again with another woman. I have learned that most people that do things like that never stop. Yes I know y'all were only together for 2 months when it happened, but if he acted like everything was fine then somethings weird about that. If you honestly feel like that was wrong then try to move on. I promise that he isn't the only man out there. There are good men that will be faithful.|`|q3INGooraa	oh this has nothing on mine! haha, but it's kinda the same..answer in my topic please!!! ty<br>  <br>  ok, i've been seeing my gf now for alil over 1 month, but it's been a long distance relationship. we both say we love each other, i know i love her but it seems like she doesn't love me like she says she does. her sister went into surgery last night to get her jaw fixed and she wont go out into the hall for a few seconds to remind me that she loves me, i call her over and over again to try and get ahold of her to say that i love her, which she just ignores my calls when shes in the room with her sis. she CAN text while in the room but she doesn't do that much either b/c shes "taking care" of her sister when all the doctors should be doing that int he first place, that is their job. also, another thing, we never met in person, im supposed to fly up there next week. i understand that she needs to take care of her little sister but her mom/dad is there too, why cant they watch her for a few seconds? and also, last night i went onto her myyearbook (kinda like myspace) and i seen she was talking to some guys saying that their hot and ****, she even gave 1 guy her #...she says that she only called the guy hot/sexy b/c she was trying to build his confadence to that he could go out and get a girlfriend, which i dont believe much but i have no other choice...and the other guy that my girlfriend gave her # to, she says she only did that cuz she thinks it's funny when people give out their #'s and they never text or anything. she calls me a controling asshole because i dont want her on the internet anymore talking to guys and stuff, and not to give her # out anymore. hows that make me controling? i see it as trying to save our relationship. and make it healthy. dont u agree? what should i do? please answer this, sorry for it being so long. but i've been on the edge of braking up with her for a few days, but im trying to make this work. please help me
4a7c50419b27b4fefd08cb721f77d3adaa	You need to be honest with him. The more you wait the more he's going to get hurt.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	I think you've already answered your own question.  Do you really need total stranger's opinion on this?|`|DpK6P8cUaa	Ok. Number one wrong thing to do: NEVER GO OUT WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND. It never goes well. Next don't break up with him or tell him you don't like him by text or phone call. Next to know if he likes you or to make your friend jealous. Test him. Ask him to do an outrageous thing and if he does then he likes you and if he doesn't it's not nothing to cherish. Love is sunlight not cloudy weather. Other than that. Go tell him how you feel. Go up to him and talk. One on One. Don't be afraid. If you don't like the position you put yourself in then you have to get yourself out. Nobody can't do anything, but give you ideas and advice. And my advice to you is tell him up straight. Ok, I love what we have [or what we had], but I don't feel the way I used to. I think we should take a break. Say it sweet and soft, so he won't get mad. And leave it off with a peck on the cheek. And walk away quietly.<br>  <br>  Your Welcome,<br>  Victoria :)|`|APVaHaZlaa	Just get it over with and break up with him now.  youll feel so relieved.  Theres not really a nice way to do it so just be blunt.  When you talk to him just be like, this isn't really working.

I suppose you could try online dating. I've heard positive things about that. Be patient, it'll happen eventually, sometimes all it takes is some time. Probably not what you want to hear. It sounds like you're a nice enough guy (plus you're picture is very good looking) so I hope you'll find a girl that's good enough for ya very soon!

I am 18 and never had a boyfriend. Im a virgin and intend to stay that way until marraige, but that is my choice. Is there something wrong with a 20 year old virgin man? No. Infact, I think its great if a guy holds out. Tooo many guys have been around and around and around and around the EVERY block thinking its normal simply bc they are male. Well, dont measure you success in relationships through sex. Concentrate on finding somone who complements you. You are young, and have to find a proffession, take care of self COMPLETELY and you must be WHOLE AND INDEPENDENT BY YOURSELF before the right one comes your way.<br>  consider that kind of soul you want and what package you willing to accept it wrapped in<br>  consider your own situation, style, habits, beliefs, ect. <br>  your first date probably wont be your last.<br>  <br>  your not a bad looking guy so you shouldnt have a probably attracting females physically.

RSbn5STjaa	Ever notice that only the supposed BBWs ever refer to themselves as BBWs?   When's the last time you heard someone say "hey look at that BBW!" ?|`|yDMaxiw9aa	What you have heard is correct BBW is a common abbreviation for Big Beautiful Women and many share the same view as you do that most big women arnet beautiful thought the girls that have a bit of meat on their bones are better looking than the stick thin girls where you can see there ribs, in my opinion. Some may like that. I sure don't<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm not a lemon im just saying i hate looking at really thin people it makes me feel sick, as does looking at grossly overweight poeple|`|gGpDv7Xdaa	Hey, I do not agree with your statement.<br>  <br>  Just because you may weigh more then others does not mean you can't look beautiful. There are many woman who are heavy set and still look nice.<br>  <br>  Please also understand that it's not just what you look like that can make you attractive, but the type of personality you have and the way you interact with others is what really shows your beautiful side.|`|mXO2TOUjaa	ever thought of Beautiful black women?????|`|Hf94X5Wvaa	Back in my day, trolling meant something.|`|CyAs4Y7uaa	It does mean that but beauty is what you think about something/one|`|S4qLj0CCaa	it means BIG BLACK WOLF lol no  it does mean big beautiful women|`|PIuEcCRPaa	i thought it ment big black woman but ur right too!|`|qtDV9kaGaa	THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH TODAYS SOCIETY.<br>  <br>  THESE WOMEN EAT CHEESEBURGERS ALL DAY AND THEN STILL WANT THE PENIS.<br>  <br>  WELL LADIES YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.|`|0aAMPbvFaa	no that's what it means. it's an inherent oxymoron|`|NVrLg3Bjaa	YOU ARE VERY WRONG and just a moron.  Big women ARE beautiful and NO WOMAN needs you or any other man to tell us.<br>  <br>  I just love how so many of you put an emphasis on weight.  I'm 215 pounds and damn proud of it.  Its people like you and others on here that cause anorexia, bulimia and women to be self conscious.  I refuse to be ashamed of the way I look,  no woman should be ashamed of her body.<br>  <br>  <br>  WOW really, that was a great insulting e-mail.  Too bad it didn't hurt my feelings.  I'm not going to stop being proud of my body because some loser on the internet called me fat and TRIED to hurt my feelings.  Grow the f**k up.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	big beautiful black woman. i think.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	you are right.<br>  big women are not attractive at all.<br>  there are big boned women who are gorgeous but fat women are gross because fat is gross.|`|pDptioSNaa	Beauty = Confidence<br>  <br>  Weight comes and goes!|`|ACVKajUIaa	Big Black Willy|`|vVTmJjJDaa	you're not right or wrong - beauty is in the eye of the BBW's admirer.
WGcfzIfKaa	honestly it shouldnt matter really...im 19 years old and my boyfriend is 26 going to be 27 its almost a 7 year age difference i have been together with him for almost a year and ive never been happier...go with your heart cause if you dont you will regret it|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	It's a bit of a stretch...  You're barely an adult, and he's at an age where a lot of people have kids and mortgages. <br>  <br>  I suspect that as time goes by and the infatuation wears off, he will find you to be immature and you will find him to be "old".|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	Age doesn't matter when both parties are mature.  Based on the way you wrote your question, I'd say you have some more growing up to do.  This guy may say he likes your mind, but believe me, he wants the obvious a lot more.  His friends will think he's a real stud if he lands a fresh little 21 year old.|`|oAPSJnSEaa	Love is love but ae sometimes does matter. I'm 23 and my bf is 30. When we argue he always pulls the age card, which really pisses me off or uses my age as a crutch for his invalid arguments -_-. It will take a lot of work esp. because you are just turning 21 and should be out having fun partying and figuring out who you are. At his age he may know who he is and set in his own ways. Also you may want different things at this point in your lives. If you care for him you can do it just know its not going to be easy.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	At your age there isn't really a "too old".  It's all up to you.  When I was 35 I dated a girl who was 18.  She asked me out and she was so beautiful I couldn't say no.  I never thought I'd ever date someone who was so beautiful.  I couldn't see why they would ever want me.  My last class reunion I found out there were lots of girls who would have gone out with me in high school but I never dated in school.  My ex and I had a wonderful two years until she cheated on me.  You might find your two have a lot in common.  There is no too old at your age.  The only time when too old comes into play is when the girl is 14 through 16 or younger.  then too old means pedophile in most cases.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck.|`|SsB7aRExaa	The age isn't a problem.  Your immaturity is a SERIOUS problem.  You sound like a pre-teen.|`|dGYSLZqjaa	if you both love each other and are happy,then age doesn't matter.Just make sure you know that he's unmarried and you are his everything-unless of course,he has kids.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	If you have found true love and happiness that is what is the most important in life. Don't let anybody make you feel that you are doing something wrong or stupid. This is your life and you live it the way you want and you want to be happy. They have a problem. Anybody who would critizie or have anything negative to say about your relationship is not a friend. Don't let people like that have space in your mind. Enjoy the love you have found!|`|xo1Lbui5aa	It doesn't matter as long as you love him and he loves you. My parents are 11 years apart too and they stayed married for 17 years. (the only reason why  they broke up is because she said that she was tired of my dad not being a good financial provider for our family) But I say that you should just go for it because he sounds right for you. I feel the same way about my boyfriend and we've been together for a while, so it must be real.|`|Cqd1fkC0aa	Who cares, you're an adult, you can date whomever you please. My uncle and aunt are a decade apart and they are very happy in their marriage. If you like him, who cares how old you are or how old he is- age ain't nothing but a number.|`|w4kdTalPaa	If everything else is good in the relationship the age thing should have no bearing.|`|AA10860409	If you love this person why are 10 years of age difference even an issue?|`|nAK82h6vaa	Well i've gone with guys 15 yrs.older then me,I'm 26.Just depends i guess.|`|AdPkwKTTaa	ur dad hade u at 10-13?!?!?!!?|`|0d811LEXaa	Age doesn't matter when your old enough to know, I would think different if you were 16 through18 dating a 31 year old, but 20 and 30 your fine, dint let something dumb like 10 years ruin what sounds like a great thing.  <br>  <br>  I had dated this really wonderful woman that I thought was close to my age but turned out she was 10 years older than I am, she could not get over it, I really did like her a lot and had a great time but the age difference really bothered her so it just didn't last, <br>  <br>  Don't let the same thing happen to you, your obviously happy with the guy and don't let your friends and relatives ruin it for you, it is only a number and since your older than a teen and an adult that knows better.  Enjoy it seriously, don't let others and yourself tear you and him apart over the age for what sounds like a great thing you both have together.|`|YLTZQiOaaa	It seems to me like this "guy friend" is someone who fits a rare criterion for you.  Just because you don't come across..compatible people, doesn't mean you can't find someone your own age.  If you have an issue with younger guys being wrapped up in themselves, their appearance, or just being immature, maybe you should see how it works out.  Just don't get carried away with how incredible mature you think you are or how young you think he acts.  Sounds to me like you have an awesome friend regardless.  It's possible that your feelings will eventually become debilitating with all the day-dreaming and imagining his lips and whatnot while you're with him.  Will you get over it if you don't pursue it?  If not, then go for it.  I wouldn't go for it unless I thought there was a chance that they might be in to me, but I have a feeling you two share something that makes you compatible in an intimate way...but I'm basically guessing just what your situation really is.|`|kv5lGrSdaa	All the guys that I have gone out with were older except for two. That is just what I am attracted to. Those two guy that weren't older, I thought they were older. My personal limit is 9 years, ten years is pretty close to that. LOL I say if you really have feelings for the guy and you see yourself with him in the future, then go ahead and do what you go to do. You are old enough and hopefully smart enough to see if he's a creepy pervert guy looking for the wronf things. From what you described he seems like a nice guy. Only you know. The people who are telling you don't do it, or yes, do it, don't know how both of you all feel about each other. They are just looking at the situation from the outside. Talk to him about what he likes most about you. Get to know him more thatn you already do. Learn why he enjoys being around you so much. Doing that will get you a better idea of what you should do. Good Luck!|`|LxbBjLxgaa	I know a couple people who are ten-plus years apart, and have been married for a longgg time.<br>  Sometimes age doesnt matter, and it is always better to date older guys, rather than younger guys.<br>  <br>  And hey, at least the man isnt 80 years old, because then you would probably be called a gold digger...<br>  <br>  I say go for it. =]. Whats the worst that can happen?|`|Pd5cHFY1aa	I really don't think it matters what age you are. I have a friend whose mom and dad got married and they were a full ten years apart.

She's being unreasonable and so long as your fiance is in agreement with you, why care about such a horrid MIL?  <br>  <br>  And you can bet that if the cousin was forced to invite you (which is likely) then they're not losing sleep over you not coming. Since you're getting married soon too you understand about not wanting people to attend if they feel obliged. If you feel really bad then send them a card and a gift voucher or something.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	Leave it alone. Let her calm down. Did they give you advanced notice about the wedding in VT? I fly all the time and find deals for $250 going coast to coast. If yes, just call them and apologize saying you can't make it and wish them well. Family is family. My 3rd cousins are coming to mine. If you just found out, hey, it's short notice and the money is going else where, your own wedding. She'll get over it. Just don't get to her level. You be the adult in this situation.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I have a bully of a mother in law and to turn the cheek and look the other way doesn't work, suggest laying into her and put her in her place, otherwise she will walk all over you and make you miserable, unless you have the personality of a beaten doormat.

And they can afford it.|`|PBdPD748aa	i think your fiance should stick it to her for being such a selfish b*tch.<br>  <br>  she had no right to call and yell at you. its his mother and she yelled at you so it is best that your fiance call her and tell her how inappropriate and out of line that was, so she knows to respect you in future as your fiance is on your side.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	He has to handle this, not you. And he has to handle it not by trying to placate her or ignore her, but by telling her not to talk to you in that way in the future. He'd better stand up for you and not make excuses for her or blame you (the old "she won't let me").<br>  <br>  She's trying to make your life miserable because she wants to control you. I suspect everyone else in her life just lets her have her way because it's "easier" or because they are lazy (but they'll call it "not wanting to make waves"). The person who stands up becomes the Wicked Witch.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You think you have problems now? Just wait til you are married if you don't have this under control now.

Ignore her nasty comments. You fiance shouls be defending you.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Don't start an argument with her.. let your fiance deal with it.

I am so sorry what a Bia!|`|2M68xiN5aa	Honestly, the details of it doesn't matter. You BOTH are grown *** adults and can make your own decisions. If YOU or HE or you BOTH don't want to attend, whatever your reasoning it is YOUR and/or HIS decision. HE NEEDS TO TELL Momma to cut the cord and stop manipulating and controlling her grown *** son and that she shouldn't judge situations where she is not informed of the details. <br>  <br>  It HAS GOT TO BE HIM! She is not going to stop controlling and manipulating situations until HE stands up and essentially says "Mom I got this". She will only see him as her baby boy NOT as a man UNLESS he stands up to her (respectfully) as a man and makes her realize it is an "us" not a "me" now. He has GOT to deamand respect. It sounds harsh but it is the only way I've EVER seen a controlling mother STOP her BS. <br>  <br>  FYI.....I feel your pain honey.....been there done that got the t-shirt and still living it......gotta love Mom's who can't cut the cord!|`|ddXDh7rCaa	If your MIL brings this up again, I would politely reminder her that this cousin did not attend the last few weddings for her side of the family, and as your fiancée is not close to his cousin you feel no need to go to the wedding.  I would not bring up the issue of money, as this is none of her business.  If she persists in being difficult I would tell her that you and your fiancée have already made your decision and that is the end of the discussion.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	deep breath in, deep breath out!  Don't tell her she was out of line to reprimand you because it will probably lead to a bigger argument (been there, done that!)<br>  <br>  You're going through a wedding yourself so you understand not everyone will be able to make it. You probably also understand it is an invitation not a command performance. <br>  <br>  If you and your fiance are okay with not going - then don't.  If your MIL doesn't like the decision the two of you made together let it be her drama!|`|vyL7yEleaa	tell her that if she wants you all to come out she can pay for it! that is the reason they have RSVP cards is because not all out of town guest are going to be able to make it specially if they have their own wedding a month later. <br>  <br>  your mil was out of line to yell at you for not coming because you can not afford it. it's like i know my uncle won't come.. he didn't even come to his own sisters wedding but i am sending him an invitation just because he is family. but i know he won't come.
hsZnjZvoaa	the papers may be the date that the clerk of court recorded it. <br>  <br>  An incorrectly filled out date on the marriage license (especially if it was an error at the court) probably should not invalidate it - it's more of an administrative error. <br>  <br>  I would say take it to the clerks office and ask them or call a family law attorney in your jurisdiciton.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Take it down to the county courthouse where it was registered.

This really bothers me. get help.
469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	There is no place in the US or Canada that allows those under 18 to marry without the express written consent of one or both parents. For instance, this is from about.com's "Getting Married in Nevada":<br>  <br>  "If you are 16 or 17 years old, you must have one parent or legal guardian present. A notarized written permission is also acceptable. It must be written in English and needs to state the name, birth date, age of the minor child, along with the relationship of the person giving consent. The notary must note that the parent or guardian personally appeared before or was subscribed and sworn to."|`|X8C9Zwj9aa	Get to know him better if he wants to marry you and live together.

T3b4I4kXaa	You have been stung twice and are trying to avoid getting bit again. <br>  <br>  Since it has been 10 years, and since you have a pretty messed-up record so far, I suggest you do date the old flame, but take things nice and slow. <br>  <br>  See if you can gather some pertinent information on him to have a background check done by a private investigator. You need some information... any child support payments he is making, his credit history, arrest record and whatever else.|`|Htsa4B0maa	Get to know him for a while more before deciding, after all those years apart, you never knew what he was up to. many people changes over so many years. take care<br>  <br>  pls ans my qn too<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atx6aghPk5avrIzq2QNnjlbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309190428AABPbyz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|GQJbOblQaa	There is nothing wrong in looking forward and longing for a relationship.  Living alone is not the way for young people and at 30, you still have long life.  <br>  <br>  It is unfortunate you had 2 bad relationships but things were out of your control.  So, there is no point in blaming yourself.<br>  <br>  Please remember in marital relationship, there has to be mutual respect, adjustments, care, concern, sacrifice and true love, both emotional and physical.  Frictions are bound to be there but one must learn to adjust.  <br>  <br>  Under no circumstances, you must allow yourself to be abused, brow beaten, threatened and your self respect/self esteem must NOT be affected.  You must look at yourself with respect, always.  This feeling gives great confidence to handle any type of problem that may come.<br>  <br>  Keep your finances safe, assets safe and go ahead with forging a relationship and give your best to make it work.  By chance it does not, do not blame yourself and lose confidence.  Look forward, take care of your son and find out someone who will love you, accept you the way you are.<br>  <br>  Wish you all the very best.

Keep in mind that, yes, it might sound annoying. But because of all those hormones, and lack of life experience, teens might feel these emotions more strongly. Or be more confused about it.

Flirt with him more often and try to get alone with him whenever you can, even if the only place you see him is at school, so you can show him how great you are, just be you, and he'll start thinking about you more and more and he'll focus on what he really likes about you, and maybe he'll make you #1 on his list.  I'm going through EXACTLY the same thing, I was #2 on this guys list and I done what I told you to do and now I'm #1, and he's asking me out! So good luck!!!!!!!|`|12f49ffdfd2266e8582afb0157fc5bc9aa	If he is on your list as #2, then you know he likes you.

AA11853547	Dude,<br>  <br>  you will regret it for the rest of your life if you don't go "away" to college.  If she's really "the one" then the love will last.  At twenty, you need to go out and do some expiramenting to see what life is all about.  You've been couped up in Ohio in your little world.  Go see what's around.  I'm 37 and I don't know of one friend that married their high school sweetie.  Im not trying to be a dork, just telling you the facts.  I lived in suburban chicago, and a couple years after college moved to Phoenix.  IT IS AWESOME HERE.....Do you like baseball????  We got spring Training.  Do you Golf???  we got tons of that Do you like really hot coeds.  ASU is always voted one of the biggest party schools with the hottest chicks.  You're only a day's trip from california and the ocean too.  If this girl really is the one, she would a) understand that you need to get out of you little state and explore the world and b) be supportive of that.........Here's what happened to me when I went to college.  I had a girlfriend who was younger than me.  I went to college.  She wound up with another dude at our high school. Who's to say that  you don't go to like Akron U.  you're their and in your first semester she calls and says she's too lonely and she's dumping you.......Then you're A)out a girlfriend and B) stuck in Ohio in the middle of december (25 degrees F) when you could be in AZ in December (70 degrees farenheit)  If you don't go out and explore while you're young, before you know it you'll be married with kids and kicking yourself in the nuts for not going out and exploring.......................trustme.... NONE OF MY FRIENDS -----NONE------------WOUND UP WITH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART.  It could happen, I guess, but it's very doubtful|`|930bd5bdc8048488d024192355e1f0baaa	GO TO COLLEGE<br>  <br>  NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT|`|AA10949476	like  the first answer, at least I read the half of the story, and I think : GO TO THE COLLEGE! I have the same opinion like the first person who has answered this question.|`|AA11316159	If it's truly love, it will still be truly love when you graduate.  That sounds like something we "old" people say, but it is the truth. Nothing; not distance, not time, not circumstances will destroy true love.<br>  <br>  Calling you and texting you every 10 minutes is far closer to stalking than it is to love.  It sounds like this young lady has serious dependency issues.  Going "crazy" when you told her you had a wonderful opportunity doesn't sound like she has your best interests at heart, either; and, if you love someone, you always have their best interests at heart.<br>  <br>  What are her plans for the future?  She's 18, you said, so she should be about ready for college, right?  What are her life goals? Or are her life goals completely hinged on YOUR life goals?  If so, run!<br>  <br>  If you have an opportunity to move from Ohio to Arizona, to live with your Dad and go to college out there, then you should do it.  It's a whole different part of the country; you will meet people who have completely different attitudes toward life; there is a large Native American population in Arizona and there is much to be learned from that community (IF you are respectful toward that community and wait to be invited in); Depending upon where in Arizona you are, you're close to New Mexico or California, both places of great interest and beauty.  You're also not that far away from Mexico, a beautiful country to visit.<br>  <br>  At 20 years old, you are too young to stop your life based on the selfish demands of another.  Ask yourself this:  would you stop her from a wonderful opportunity or would you be supportive of it?  Would you want her to miss something she might always regret missing?<br>  <br>  If everyone you've asked has told you to move, it might be best if you listened to them.  You will find love and it will probably be a healthier love.  There is no reason on this earth for one partner to call another every 10 minutes other than to check up on what they are doing.  She may be saying "I'm calling you to tell you that i love you," which is a nice thing if done once a day or something ... but, as the mother of a 27 y/o son, i'm telling you that the every 10 minutes calls are to check up on you, determine where you are, listen to what's in the background, etc. and the "i love you" and "i'm thinking about you" or whatever it is she's saying is nothing but a ruse on her part.<br>  <br>  If your parents think it's a great opportunity for you; if your friends think it's a great opportunity for you; if complete strangers on this board think it's a great opportunity for you, then it's a great opportunity.<br>  <br>  How many have you talked to about this (other than her) who have told you to stay?<br>  <br>  I think she's gotten inside your head, more so than in your heart, and she knows exactly which strings to pull to make you suffer guilt.  Please don't fall into that trap at such a young age.|`|AA12094222	College should be your first priority. Now, I don't know why you need to go to AZ.?

I am kind of missing one thing in what you write: where is the best school for you? If it's in Ohio and not Arizona, then you need to stay in Ohio definitely. If the best school really is in Arizona, then you can, for example, think about arranging for her to go out there to college with you (she is old enough, after all...).<br>  <br>  As far as your being too young to get engaged, well, I'd quibble with that. You guys are awfully close, you've even lived together - that tends to mean you have a relationship which should not be broken up, for moral reasons. Sure, you need to come up with a solution that gives you the space you need, but without busting the relationship apart.<br>  <br>  All that having been said, I wouldn't stay with her out of fear that you won't find anyone else. And if you think about it, that isn't a great reason to be in a relationship. Love is where it's at.

Seriously, you have to keep yourself occupied. Stay active, whether you are chilling with friends, playing video games that keep your brain off her, anything. I spent every day with my best friend (who wouldnt even let me speak my ex's name around her). We would go out and stay busy all day and all night.

You are probably afraid of rejection, but that's not the end of the world. You are worth liking and unless he's playing sick games it seems he likes you already. It'll sound lame to say, "Do you like me?" but it's not lame to say, "You want to go to (whatever) and hang out?" You'll know then if he just wants to play the hug game, but don't want anything more. I hate standing around and wondering about this stuff. I learned while in school to strike up conversations and see where they lead, then asking for a number if he hasn't asked for mine yet. I also learned don't hang around talking a long time when you have other things that must be done. You never over-do talking.

75623f3113a60dbad98e2082d50071c8aa	First, you should know that I'm a teacher at a boy's juvenile lock-up facility. All my students are prisoners. This doesn't make me an authority, but it does give me a certain perspective.<br>  <br>  You won't like what I have to say, but the truth is that you have made your own bed, now you have had to lay in it. Your son acts this way because you allow him to act this way. I see many of my students who are locked up because their parents did not establish guidelines at home. Many of my students think they rule the roost until they find out that me or the staff at our facility don't put up with it and we expect our guidelines and rules to be followed. You allow your son to act like a jerk, then he'll continue to do it. Right now, it seems he's the boss in your house, not you or your husband.<br>  <br>  You can't fix what you have already screwed up, all you can do is fix the future. I think you should do two things.<br>  <br>  1. See if your son needs psycological help. This is important. He may in fact need to see a shrink.<br>  <br>  2. You and your husband talk and establish and write down what you feel your normal everyday expectations are. Writing them down is very important. Then have a sit down with your son and go over your expectations. Tell him what you expect from him is not a request but a requirement. Put the ball in his court.<br>  <br>  Then, its very important for him to know that he has to pay the consequences for his actions. Positive actions pay positive consequences and negative actions get negative consequences. Take away his privilages if he doesn't shape up. I would not resort to physical abuse, but I guarantee if you make his life miserable he will shape up.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for negative actions at first because he'll want to test you. You need to be consistent and apply the pressure to make him want to change to be a happier person.<br>  <br>  This is a simple formula that has worked thousands of times. But, if you can't follow it, can't apply it or can't be consistent, then quite frankly you deserve all the attitute your son will give you because it will be obvious that he is the boss of your family.|`|4815d55767acda3385a0b36bab8a48f1aa	Get him into therapy ASAP|`|9435f4a2648623dbc485c9f881b8aea4aa	Sounds like the child needs to see a doctor, he needs a friend someone that he can relate to or get along well with, its not good for him to clam up inside that's where child suicides come from , theres something definitely wrong with him, perhaps hes missing his mother?
Jcu24pe3aa	Dear lilliana,<br>  Sometimes, less is more. Just express your sadness for his loss. He is most likely still in shock and grieving. he is not ready to talk about it yet. You can however let him know you are there for him, if he ever needs anyone to talk to. Ask if there is anything you can do for him or his family.  Other than that , let some time pass before you bring up the subject.|`|oTV3Bro5aa	Just let him know that you are there for him if he needs you. It is always hard to find something to say during hard times like that. I think that him knowing that you are there for him will help more than any words that you could say.<br>  <br>  ~Candice~|`|9c81eb996ee1f7476f9e0c5da37dfad1aa	Not much you can say unfortunately, but you can take him places, keep his mind busy...|`|YKztIzataa	Um................ well you cant realy say that much because you dont want to hurt them. Well if the friend is religous just remind them of the hope of heven or if they are a jehovahs witness............ explain about the hope of a resurection on earth............. I dont know... Just dont over do it. comfort her as much as you can and just tell her to cry her heart out because it will truly make her feel beter.|`|kPyVTLRKaa	my really good friends mom killed herself, and my other good friends dad killed himself in the same month. it was hard for me to talk to them about it, just be there for him.. if he needs anything. i'm sorry that happend. tough life.. just tell him that <br>  his father is in a better place.. <br>  i honestly don't beleive that life can get bad enough to take it away, i'm sorry..for your loss.<br>  <br>  ... =/|`|zj9kKyg3aa	You don't even have to mumble. Just being there with him through his tough time is already a big help. Trust me. I experienced almost the same thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10225101	It's very difficult to express with exact words but I feel that his father may be suffering from acute depression. In such difficult  situation it is better to be with your friend because your presence is everything for him.|`|ZSYR7oKCaa	Should have paid more attention to him.Now look what you did.|`|rnVrDZPgaa	I think you already have a good idea of what you need to do from the posts which are already on here, but they are all right.<br>  <br>  Its not really a matter of what to say, its more a case of just being there to support them.<br>  <br>  Allot of the time things you say which you feel may help are often taken the wrong way and end up coming out wrong and can lead to an argument.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do is just show you are there for them, it may not seem that they appreciate it at the moment, but in the long run they will be really grateful for your help.<br>  <br>  Good luck and i hope it all works out :-)
cb6484c90bdeb557cd670f12c38f5ccbaa	Yes because now I have meet an even better girl.|`|1b0ff7897b5a09fcff1bc545e60e3f56aa	I think this goes person by person.  Some split up and their lives get stagnant, some get better, some get back together with their ex.  After you break up with someone, your best course of action is to just concentrate on yourself and put all the energy you were putting to that old relationship to yourself.|`|tvA1i6Fiaa	no not really cuz i spend every day with her (sence shes one of my best friends) and it makes it harder cuz there are signs like it but were not and its a big confusing mess because shes the same way with her other ex and its kinda ******|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Yes life is lonley but much better since she split<br>  <br>  what does a kid hanging himself and his sad parents have to do with that?
AA11732882	it doesnt matter. im short.|`|1b2b0626164d4cde0d00e36e883d1f0baa	i like average , say 5.3 or more but not very tall|`|AA11025669	Doesn't matter. Height doesn't make the woman.|`|2f8770b240edffcea2e9d67f4a7d40c9aa	Both are great if they're great otherwise.|`|8d3b46a41a69b00c8e8b864e3c97c9e1aa	Height means nothing to me in a partner. It's how they act and what they do that matters to me.|`|cf8f043773f594bd0c8cd6313dffb683aa	Height is not relevant to me|`|F4jjNdFYaa	I think I like tall girls. I'm 5'11, and I wouldn't mind dating girls taller than me! Tall girls have longer legs!|`|bgYFxq8Raa	I'm a girl; I prefer guys taller than me and preferable 5'10 and taller; but honestly height shouldn't matter, it's the person that does.|`|fbec92d18ec370f4adabd7e8fd648be2aa	Much better to look at character...not height.|`|ym9nSmgcaa	i like a girl to be lower than me. i think it is werid for a guy to have a tall girlfriend.
86nZ6xSBaa	Oh yeah... the forbidden fruit.  However, you can't do it for too long or the guy will lose interest.|`|SXhUYRXBaa	i'm not sure but in 6th grade i had a young teacher who told us a story about when he was in college and he was in his dorm painting and this girl who liked him came and kept bugging him and he got mad and told her to paint a picture if it would make her shut up and she made a picture of an engagement ring. she was not playing hard to get. he said it wasn't intriguing. he told all the 6th grade girls to throw rocks at guys (not literally)|`|vZhVSYDMaa	For the most part, no.<br>  <br>  Being too distant creates many problems. The man might feel as if you have lost interest, or he himself might lose interest.<br>  <br>  However, being too close also has it's cons. The man might get bored, so always have a couple tricks up your sleeve. It's best to just stay at a moderate distance.|`|URqzvpKoaa	Hehehe No!!! If you really want something you want to be close to it. Those are called headgames...lol.<br>  That's not the best way to be intriguing.
9a734c12c8a5bcbcb7f973ccdc4ed0eaaa	if you want that book find someone who had the ebook version and ask them to email it to you<br>  <br>  or order the ebook yourself|`|AA11685346	So.... your a gay?<br>  <br>  -James|`|xdnGjioUaa	RELAXXXXXXXX ... jeeze the whole first portion of this question was about how annoying you think do gooders are and how you are smart and getting a scholarship<br>  <br>  maybe you should loosen up and maybe more women would like/ talk to you|`|hT0hZyWtaa	il double ur dating right now.<br>  <br>  OK MAN. YOU WANT TO SUCK UP TO GIRLS THAT YOU LIKE RIGHT??!! WELL DONT F*CKING DO THAT. TEASE AND MAKE RUDE JOKES WITH GIRLS YOU FIND INTERESTING. DONT PUT TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ONE GIRL.<br>  <br>  Actually use that and you will quadruple your dating
d175a93cc4fa0d1d52c4056726898b5baa	why not,<br>  there is no time like the future <br>  to let someone know how you feel about them.<br>  are you going into high school next year.<br>  if not, then you are probably too young.|`|BIwtjPkuaa	yep sure go for it!!! good luck!!!|`|HwS0zwzTaa	do what you feel like is okay....<br>  <br>  actually go for it.<br>  <br>  if you cant decide flip some 2 sided thing and pick sides and then do what side you picked....|`|2XrI8SKqaa	if you want|`|IGbLNqEAaa	in my opinion yeah you should tell him because he'll know how u feel and he'll probably see a new side of you liek you'll stand out of the crowd. theres a 50/50 chance of this happening. just be open w/ him and i hope this works.|`|SIuEbQrWaa	i would let him go because he's going into highschool and he'll meet more people and forget about you.. he'll be doing "highschool" things... i just don't think it would work|`|3EWMXC4Kaa	God I hate the feeling.<br>  I've had alot of experience in the love.<br>  Tell him you like him, Cause if you don't then nothing will ever happen.<br>  Take control, and if he says he dosn't like you just keep hanging with him, let him get to know you alot better and he will grow to like you|`|8xOrlLrNaa	well I was in this same situation! And I did tell him and now we talk but its not like we r together but what's the point of likeing someone that might not like u! So basically tell him and if he doesnt like u back then f orget him!|`|POP5vNrYaa	Go for it!  What's the worst that could happen?|`|Pzxema4Zaa	No of course not. He might take advantage of that, because he may think that you are young, dumb, and naive. Don't let him be right about you. You should never date someone who's more older than you, if you're not over 18. Keep him at a distance within a conversation at the risk of that slipping out of your mouth.|`|QZWMkuJUaa	I guess you should.that's what i would do if my crush was gonna go to a different school.otherwise it can hang over you forever.|`|r236ogw9aa	yeah do it. act like a desperate little girly girl and fling your padded bra'd , braided, turquiose braces-ed self at mr big freshman next year

So I guess that means that they're just comfortable with you and see you as one of the gang.|`|6kCiKXJiaa	all guy see are boob,s keep ur firend|`|94c58858a05dc369568305c5d40bd4c5aa	this usually happen to hot girls|`|06P9KJNGaa	you must be popular with the fellas

Are there flirtations going on from both sides?  If the romantic element isn't there already, he might kind of freak out if you suddenly ask him out.  Flirt with him at first - smile at him a lot, make a lot of eye contact, touch him lightly, use body language.  When he starts returning it, it might be safe to ask him out. Or he might ask you out himself.<br>  <br>  edit. I agree with Rainbow, who answered above me. It's not a good idea to ask a guy out. He might think he could do better than you or just think that it means free sex. Just flirt with him until he asks you out.|`|itp6El1Naa	Then you're obviously too young to be dating if you don't even know how to ask a guy out.<br>  <br>  Just ask him to hang out at the movies or something, don't get too serious... what's the difference between best friends and boyfriend besides kissing? And if you two break up (which there is a 99% probability that you will), what if he doesn't treat you the same anymore and you lose a good friendship?

Neste caso o simples fato de pedir desculpas e dizer "eu errei mas te amo muito e vou mudar por vc" resolveria melhor o problema. Sempre tive relacionamentos sérios e duradouros, que terminaram na base da sinceridade e cumplicidade, reconquistei pessoas provando que gostava delas, com frases bonitas, emails de cora??o e sentimento mas nunka com presentes, pq isso pra mim é menosprezar a mulher, coisa que n?o sou adepto.<br>  <br>  Um bjo e muitas felicidades pra ti|`|RHzcwPi8aa	concordo com você pois um sentimento,um gesto de carinho ou até mesmo um olhar sincero vale mais do que qualquer quantia de dinheiro compreendo você pois sei que há pessoas que colocam o dinheiro em primeiro plano. é colega no mundo em que vivemos o dinheiro fala mais alto concordo plenamente com a sua pessoa admiro pessoas assim a minha resposta  enfim é o dinheiro nao compra a felicidade nem a dignidade de ninguêm.

E o homem, quando transa, é diferente da mulher.  Ainda bem, né?  Na hora do orgasmo, nosso corpo é invadido por uma quantidade enorme de horm?nios que nos causam a sensa??o de prazer.  Isso faz com que nosso corpo relaxe.  N?o quer dizer que viramos para o lado e dormimos (eu n?o fa?o isso) mas ficamos "molinhos"  é o que se chama de período refratário.

a1fd88f790a0678a27ed250641a82a78aa	Karlzdrago, estoy completamente de acuerdo contigo y bien lo sabes, pues hasta que alguién hace una pregunta para un bien común, eneverdad cada día te admiro más, y bueno cuentas con mi apoyo, y con lo que tu quieras hacer.<br>  <br>  Es verdad necesitamos hacer algo, necesitamos ponernos las pilas, hacer conciencia, y tratar de evitar contaminar, tratar de crear más areas verdes, tratar de dar apoyo a nuestra naturaleza, porfavor, ayudemos a nuestro planeta!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Después de la reunión de expertos de la ONU sobre el Cambio Climático realizada en Paris Francia el 1 de febrero de 2007,   se determinó que solo quedan 10 a?os para que entre todos podamos <br>  frenar la catástrofe ambiental y climática que se avecina, la responsabilidad NO es solo de políticos y empresarios, así que lo que cada habitante de la Tierra haga en contra de estos fenómenos es clave para <br>  salvar el planeta, nuestras vidas y las de nuestras futuras generaciones.<br>  <br>  Así que no más protestas inútiles porque estas acciones y consejos<br>  Sí HACEN LA DIFERENCIA!!! Mejor actuar!!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1. AGUA:  <br>  - Consume la justa.<br>  - Evita gastos innecesarios de agua con estos consejos:<br>  * Manten la ducha abierta sólo el tiempo indispensable, cerrándola mientras te enjabonas.<br>  * No dejes la llave abierta mientras te lava los dientes o te afeitas.<br>  * No laves los alimentos con la llave abierta, utiliza un recipiente. Al terminar, esta agua se puede aprovechar para regar las plantas.<br>  * No te enjabones bajo el chorro de agua.<br>  * Utiliza la lavadora y el lavavajillas sólo cuando estén completamente llenos.<br>  * No arrojes al inodoro bastoncillos, papeles, colillas, compresas, tampones o preservativos, no es el cubo de la basura.<br>  * Repara inmediatamente las fugas, 10 gotas de agua por minuto suponen 2.000 litros de agua al a?o desperdiciados.<br>  * Utiliza plantas autóctonas, que requieren menos cuidados y menos agua.<br>  * Reutiliza parte del agua que usa tu lavadora de ropa, esta te podrá servir para los ba?os, limpiar pisos, hacer aseo o lavar el frente de tu casa.<br>  * No vacíes la cisterna sin necesidad.<br>  * No tires el aceite por los fregaderos. Flota sobre el agua y es muy difícil de eliminar.<br>  * No arrojes ningún tipo basura al mar, ríos o lagos.<br>  * Riega los jardines y calles con agua no potable.<br>  * El mejor momento para regar es la última hora de la tarde ya que evita la evaporación<br>  * El agua de cocer alimentos se puede utilizar para regar las plantas<br>  * El gel, el champú y los detergentes son contaminantes. Hay que usarlos con moderación, y de ser posible optar por productos ecológicos.<br>  * No olvides plantar un árbol por lo menos una vez en tu vida.<br>  <br>  2. BASURA:  <br>  - Más de la mitad son reciclables ?Por qué no las RECICLAMOS y AHORRAMOS?<br>  * La ley de las 3 Erres: *RECICLAR*, *REDUCIR* el consumo innecesario e irresponsable y *REUTILIZAR* los bienes.<br>  <br>  * Al recuperar cajas de cartón o envases que también son hechos con papel contribuyes a que se talen menos árboles, encargados de capturar <br>  <br>  metano y de purificar el aire. Al reutilizar 100 kilogramos de papel se salva la vida de al menos 7 árboles.<br>  * Separa las basuras que generas. Debes consultar en tu administración local o en tu unidad residencial si disponen de un sistema de selección de basuras.<br>  * Usa siempre papel reciclado y escribe siempre por los dos lados.<br>  * Usa RETORNABLES.<br>  * No derroches servilletas, pa?uelos, papel higiénico u otra forma de papel.<br>  * Elije siempre que puedas envases de VIDRIO en lugar de Plástico, Tetrapack y Aluminio.<br>  * Recuerda que hay empresas dedicadas a la compra de materiales reciclables como papel periódico, libros viejos, botellas etc.<br>  <br>  3. ALIMENTACIóN:   <br>  - Disminuye el consumo de carnes rojas<br>  * Disminuye el consumo de carnes rojas ya que la cría de vacas contribuye al calentamiento global, a la tala de árboles y la disminución de los ríos.<br>  Producir un kilo de carne gasta más agua que 365 duchas.<br>  * Los productos enlatados consumen muchos recursos y energía. No consumas alimentos en lata especialmente atún porque esta en vía de extinción.<br>  * Evita consumir alimentos "transgenicos" (OMG Organismos manipulados genéticamente) ya que su producción contamina los ecosistemas deteriorando el medio ambiente<br>  * No consumas animales exóticos como tortugas, chigüiros, iguanas, etc.<br>  * Consume más frutas, verduras y legumbres que carnes.<br>  * Nunca compres pescados de tama?os peque?os para consumir.<br>  * Si puedes consume alimentos ecológicos (sin pesticidas, sin insecticidas, etc.)<br>  <br>  4. ENERGíA:  <br>  - No consumas de más<br>  * Usa agua caliente solo de ser necesario o solo la necesaria, conecta el calentador solo dos horas al día, gradúalo entre 50 y 60 grados y si puedes intenta ba?arte con agua fría es mas saludable.<br>  * Evita usar en exceso la plancha, el calentador de agua o la lavadora, que gastan mucha energía y agotan los recursos para generarla.<br>  Esto lleva a que los países se vean en la necesidad de usar petróleo, carbón o gas para copar la oferta energética, combustibles que generan gases como el dióxido de carbono, que suben la temperatura.<br>  * Mejor cocinar con gas que con energía eléctrica.<br>  * APAGA* *el TV, radio, luces, computador (pantalla) si no los estás usando.<br>  * En tu lugar de trabajo apaga las luces de zonas comunes poco utilizadas.<br>  * Utiliza bombillos (focos) de bajo consumo de energía.<br>  * Modera el consumo de latas de aluminio.<br>  * No uses o compres productos de PVC para nada, contaminan muchísimo y no son reciclables.<br>  <br>  5. TRANSPORTE:  <br>  - Modera el uso del vehiculo particular, haz un uso eficiente del automóvil<br>  * No viajes solo, organiza traslados en grupo o en transporte público. <br>  Infla bien las llantas de tu carro para que ahorre gasolina y el motor no la queme en exceso.<br>  * Empieza a utilizar la bicicleta en la medida lo posible.<br>  * Revisa la emisión de gases de tu vehículo.<br>  * No aceleres cuando el vehículo no esté en movimiento.<br>  * Reduce el consumo de Aire Acondicionado pues éste reduce la potencia y eleva el consumo de la gasolina.<br>  * Modera tu Velocidad: En carretera nunca sobrepases los 110 kilómetros por hora, ya que mas arriba produce un exagerado consumo de combustible.<br>  * Nunca cargues innecesariamente tú vehículo con mucho peso: A mayor carga mayor consumo de combustible.<br>  <br>  5. PAPEL     <br>  <br>  * Usa habitualmente papel reciclado.<br>  * Fomenta el uso de productos hechos a partir de papel usado<br>  * Reduce el consumo de papel<br>  * Usa las hojas por las dos caras<br>  * Haz sólo las fotocopias imprescindibles<br>  * Reutiliza los sobres, cajas, etc.<br>  * Rechaza productos de un sólo uso<br>  * Pide a las compa?ias que te envian publicidad que no te interesa, que dejen de mandarte o pídeles que te la envien por correo electrónico. Lo <br>  mismo al banco pide que te envien tus estados de cuenta via correo electronico.<br>  <br>  6. EDUCACIóN:   <br>  - Educa a los más jóvenes y a todo los que conozcas en el respeto a la naturaleza.<br>  - El mayor problema es la ignorancia, asi que infórmate acerca de la crisis climática, del calentamiento global y de como tu puedes poner acción y ayudar a solucionar este problema, que es responsabilidad de todos.<br>  <br>  - Recuerda que en el dar esta el recibir, la naturaleza nos ha dado cosas maravillosas, así que regresémosle un poco de todo lo que ella nos brinda cada dia, (el sol, el oxigeo, las plantas, el agua, los arboles, etc...) seamos agradecidos con nuestro planeta, es nuestra casa<br>  <br>  ????????CUIDéMOSLA!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Te amando muchos , muchos besos.|`|mwXOq3kqaa	Estoy de acuerdo con tu comentario es un problema que todos parecemos ignorar.|`|Otdh4dJxaa	problema????no!!! no hay ploblema,, o si? mejor vamonos pal antro o al billar sale!!!<<<<< no te ajites dejalo para otro dia?<<<< al fin que hay 365 dias en el anio y pues ya no quiero hablar de este tema ok|`|TH7yNhwyaa	parece ser que nosotros tenemos un problema, parece ser que como nosotros mismos individualmente nos auto destruimos, generalmente también lo hacemos y si habremos personas que recapacitamos individualmente , generalmente es muy difícil porque habremos muchas personas el la tierra y la mayoría consume, son muy pocos contra muchos.yo sembrare unas plantas en mi casa que no tengo ni una.|`|UuKb44gRaa	Creo que tu propuesta seria mejor si dijeras: "sugiero que todos nosotros", y no"que todos ustedes".

Cuando alguien no entiende consejos, es mejor dejarlo seguir su rumbo hasta que pida ayuda, yo entiendo que doloroso para usted ver esa situación, pero si se lo toma muy a pecho la mas da?ada va ser usted. Saludos|`|mK35PnJUaa	Mientras más quieras alejarla del tipo ese, más se encaprichará por él.

Puede que este chico trate de darle alas y por eso ella esta tan clavada con él, debería ser directo con ella y decirle.<br>  Se me ocurre a mí preguntarle no pues como es este chico..<br>  hija yo me he dado cuenta de que te trata mal, y no me perece eso, piensa si tu es lo que quieres como mujer a un (amigo) así.

c77f4c6237342f7110ef4e18737bd881aa	1. Guys need space sometime.  Not nessecarily "space away from you" but "space to himself"<br>  2. Sometimes girls see/feel what they want to feel, and it may not be an accurate picture of what is going on on his end.  <br>  <br>  5 years is a long time.  Don't question it because he's acting a little weird for one of those days ;)<br>  Still, any lasting relationship is going to be built on communication.  Give it some time, then ask him about it.|`|AA11118834	Let him have his time to himself.......guys are odd creatures.....one day they are all over you and the next they want their space and "manly" time......so don't call......and he will call tomorrow.....no worries......|`|2fcf48433ae5a5e9d1764bfa66724134aa	Guys act funny all the time, keep in mind they tend to be more straight forward with their emotions than girl so he could be telling the truth. But if something is really bothering him and if he starts being rude towards you when you try to talk to him then just back off. Wait until he cools off. Just try doing something else in the meantime and hang out with other friends or something. This happens to me quite frequently.|`|de76ed35aa6198f38c4ee9747fb26a87aa	you kneed to talk to him.I hope you guys stay together you soud im love and you should be together.See how he feels and whats going on.<br>  ~alicia~|`|fc954b24ead9a7efe0b17c42208ab34baa	It sounds to me like nothing is wrong, but the best thing you can do is ask him whats going on, if you have fun together and have been going out for five years I highly doubt that he is going to change his mind over night. Guys love confidence in a woman, maybe don't let him know that you are overly worried about him not feeling like being with you. Though keep in mind, confidence does not mean making a fool of yourself or being full of yourself. Its normal to want to be by yourself for a day, that is not an insult to your company. It sounds to me like he really loves you, don't sweat over this. Hope this helped, goodluck with your boyfriend!

Você tem que descobrir isso, pois pode ser isso, ele pode ter medo de ir pra cama com você e de repente  fazer feio, pois provavelmente ela deve por confian?a em você a respeito de sexo, talvez ele pense que você seja mais experiente do que ele, isso é um pouco constrangedor para um homem.<br>  Olha isso é natural pois meu primeiro namoro durou quase dois anos, e era virgem e a pessoa com quem eu estava também era, e só veio rolar sexo quase no finalzinho do nosso namoro, observa??o ele também era homem, moral da história se numa rela??o como a minha homossexual nós n?o passavamos do limite, imagine a sua que é heterossexual, já que numa rela??o é o homem é quase sempre o que toma a iniciativa, imagine ai numa rela??o com dois homens, e nem um deles tomou. Ent?o amiguinha n?o fique assim, o melhor que você deve fazer é chegar nele  e se abrir pra ele, diga que pra você ele é uma pessoa muito especial, e que você gostaria de perder sua virgindade com  ele, pois pra você ele passa seguran?a, pergunte o que ele acha disso, e veja se vale realmente a pena, acho que dessa forma ele n?o irá pensar que você seja fácil, muito pelo contrario, pois já fazem dois anos e nada rolou, e é agora que você estar com vontade.<br>  Agora amiga se n?o rolar, é melhor você investigar pra vê se  ele n?o gay, e se ele for levante a cabe?a e dê a volta por cima.|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	Ele é virgem tb?

Cd5avmhWaa	I understand that you are scared to talk to her and risk losing her but maybe that is what is best. If she is getting super jealous than it is sounding like B isn't being a very good friend to you or A. Try to spend more time with B too, but don't hang with her so much that you stop hanging with A. I just think that for the best of all three of you it might be better to try and let B go. I know that it will hurt but you have to try or things could just get worse.|`|kfmcs5hnaa	I know how you feel. It may seem hard but, I think the best way to fix this is to talk to B. Tell her that there is no reason she should be jealous because you like both A and B the same way . <br>  <br>  Hope it works out :)|`|baIGm84Yaa	A sounds like someone who would understand this predictament well, so go to her and tell her. Ask her to try to stay away for just a day or so, and I'm sure she wouldn't mind. Then take some time to go to B and tell her home much you appreciate her, and every day or week or so, whenever B seems upset or quiet, give her a big hug and remind her that she's cool.
LipnMarIaa	some people are insecure because of the way they look. other people think they won't be excepted for what there personality is really like.<br>  <br>  i personally have low self esteem and am a little insecure about the way i look (even though people tell me i look good, and my ex said i'm hot). but i have a little acne, which is my main reason for being insecure. i mean, i know it's just because of puberty and stuff, but it makes me feel like whenever people look at me, that's all they can see.|`|x9GHQ8FBaa	why do you ask dumb questions|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Have you ever felt heart break? Have you ever been verbaly and emotionaly abused? Have you ever been told how worthless you are? Have you ever been told that you will amount to nothing by the one you love?

eyVWcYGIaa	Well I would say YES, he's cheating, and I know I am a reformed cheater (semi-reformed, LOL) He is telling u that he isn't felling go o u won't ask why he didn't answer the phone when u called. I bet that the nxt time he gave u an Xcuse about being sick or having something 2 do, let him give u as much detail as possible, just like u are worried about him being sick, or just wanna did him a call after he is done what it is he has 2 do.<br>  Example1: hes sick, " awh, whats wrong, and what ya gonna do" laydown okay, your laying down now, Ok well I wanna bring u something 2 eat, or stop by just 2 drop sumthing off 2 him that will cheer him up, it will only take a second. If he says No i am going right 2 sleep, I don't want u 2 get sick from me, or I don't even wanna eat, or some lame xcuse. Say ok, then b4 hanging up just say that u feel bad and u might stop by anyway, you'll just leave it at the door. If he is cheating none of these will be acceptable 4 u 2 do. U could also say that someone u know said that they saw he out with a girl a few days ago, and u were wondering if it was him or a mistake, but sound like u believe it, let him hang his self, he will they always do. Or if it hasn't come up u could just say " are u ready to just be xclusive or do u still wanna see other ppl?" If u act like you already know, he might just admit it. But I would bet my life on it that he is cheating! 2 me it is so obvious.|`|mwewiODzaa	if you want, ask him. get the courage and tell him what you've been thinking lately and that you want to straightened things out. if you dont want to ask him or you still think he is lying, ask one of his buddies. his friends will surely know and probably tell you the truth. other people are bound to know. i would take it easy on the messaging/calling every day, give him some space. try not to be so clingy, guys dont like that. they want time to hang out with their friends, just like you do! of course continue talking to him but limit the texting/phone calles. and def. try to hang out more..that is if he isnt seeing someone. good luck!|`|HiMlJ7eEaa	snoop around and ask people aor find out the hard way.|`|vKhRzHO3aa	i think he finds u annoying my dear...and that really sux too, i kno...i think u shouldnt get into anything wit this guy, he acts too wierd, just how bout this, if u really like him then dont call him at all, and wait for him to call u, if he doesnt then 1. it wasnt meant to be. 2. he was messin around 3. he just doesnt like u anymore<br>  <br>  he acts too wierd, just drop him, i kno thats harsh but hey, u just started 2 see him, its not like uve been dating for 3 years or somethin, he acts like he doesnt wanna be wit u and u deserve someone who does, just be patient and the right guy will come...<br>  <br>  good luck?
juRWvc0eaa	So don't talk to him about it. It is obvious that he isn't communicating with you, just screaming at you. Let him go, and just stop talking to him. When he notices, he'll try to find out why. Say nothing more than "I'm done with this relationship." Saying any more opens the door back up for you to be hurt. leave it at that and then break off communication. If he refuses to leave you alone after, you could always think about getting a restraining order.<br>  Bottom line is this is NOT healthy, and you need to get away NOW!

If you date someone of a different race because you find them more 'attractive' than someone of your race, then it's possibly lust, infatuation, or a passing fad... none of which would last very long.|`|bfbeaa9447b43de780de7b676b5f633aaa	Well I'm mexican and my bf is black.

Tem mulher mais rebelde, mais docinha, mais metida, mais interesseira, mais femenista, mais tudo! No entanto todas gostam do mesmo: de receber aten??o, mimos, presentes, enfim. No entanto n?o vale a pena você dar presentes se n?o der aten??o pra elas. Algumas preferem mimos, outras presentes, mas tem uma coisa que toda a mulher gosta: cavalheirismo. Hoje em dia é t?o raro um homem ser gentil que quando a mulher encontra um se encanta. Pergunta pro meu namorado como ele me apanhou.... me tratou melhor que qualquer outro homem! E n?o é dificil, pequenas coisas, como tentar realizar as vontades, puxar a cadeira no restaurante, reservar a sobremesa que você sabe que ela gosta, mostrar que você notou os gostos dela e se preocupa em agradar. Quero ver a mulher que diga que n?o gosta disso!|`|8IciOqnsaa	tem que ser carinhoso saber trata-la como ela gosta, n?o da muito ibópe tambem ,isso é muito importante pois tem mulher que n?o gosta que a trate bem as vezes você deu esse azar.ser carinhoso n?o meloso, ser ciumento n?o exescivo,esta sempre a ligando e visitando n?o grudento...Aí quem sabe uma dessas n?o se enquadra com seu perfil, pois você parece ser um homem um pouco bruto tente ser mais romantico.bj0s.!|`|FzlBRkvVaa	Como diz o velho ditado popular <br>  XD <br>  o meio termo é a malhoer op??o.|`|Y8YPz1aLaa	N?o fique grudado nela, n?o ligue sempre na casa dela, finja que esqueceu ela por um dia, mulher fica doida com isso e só porque o cara n?o a procurou hoje ela fica louca para o ver logo, e o  principal fa?a gostoso.|`|YOWrLn6faa	eu tb naum sei, mas achu q cada mulher tem suas necessidades em especial...|`|rdpyiAPsaa	um homem que nos satisfa?a em todos os sentidos.........conquista-la todo dia como se fosse a primeira vez.........e fazer ela goza muito lógico ne............|`|saT5PnFAaa	Comece levando flores, n?o tem mulher que n?o goste de ganhar um buquê de flores, e isto n?o  faz de você um cara  mais pobre, pelo contrário, ela vai achar que encontrou um cara diferente, pois hoje em dia ninguem mais liga pra esse detalhe.<br>                Tente cara, Boa Sorte|`|yMHMbHw4aa	Casar com ela!<br>  é momentaneo, mas é o maior agrado que vocês fazem pra gente...

nYVNMedVaa	they may just "see" you as younger because you are their sister.  it's probably not personal.  i would bring it up but be prepared because they may not be receptive to hearing it.  be honest in your feelings and be prepared.  you may write down some things to say beforehand to be able to effectively get your feelings across.  if i were you i would be more confident in my friendships and you should maybe make some more friends (in addition to the ones you already have) that don't know your sisters and you can keep them separate from your current friends and sisters.  you're in a tough spot ( i know, i'm the youngest of 6 girls) but your older sisters will soon be grown up and then it will be just you so choose your words wisely.  i hope it goes well.|`|82644bccb70a7c26bc7e26b7794db8f2aa	Just sit down with them and say it.  Explain how you feel.

REfeGqgjaa	no its not embarrassing to be with someone who was raped. my current girlfriend and future wife was raped and it does not bother me. i just comfort her and let her know i will never do that to her and that if she needs someone to talk to i will be there for her.|`|66437feb3309e551addf21e447ea3523aa	have been and NOT AT ALL, you need to realize rape is a crime AGAINST the woman not something she asked for or wanted.  Would you be embarrased to be with a man who was robed?  Beat up?  Kidnapped?  Of course not!<br>  Unfortunatly its a crime that keeps hurting for years and years and its the woman who suffers|`|S3opR6kHaa	It wound not bother me at all.I dont judge peoplle and especially for something that was not their fault.If we are talking about you e-mail me if you want to talk more.I think most men should feel like this.Good Luck.No such thing as damaged goods.|`|dcd1tbbRaa	Why would it be???|`|dnE8kSziaa	for me no problem if it's an accident|`|pxFvALM4aa	no not if u care about that person it shold not matter!|`|z2BppzULaa	well i dont think it will make a difference to how the guy feels about her, but he has to keep in mind that he needs to be more attentive to her feelings and support her through stuff that he probably wouldnt have to with anybody else. esp. if she has nightmares about it, and when she withdraws  from him suddenly, its not anything personal, just a reaction to whats happened to her.
aig2FyHvaa	si tout simplement le pere part pour une autre sans faire d'histoire je suis d'accord mais pour avoir vecu l'experience en tant qu'enfant je peux vous dire que ?a ne se passe pas comme ?a !!!! le mien est parti tout en voulant revenir, n'a jamais payé de pension pour nous n'a d'ailleur jamais rien payer, venait nous pprendre les week end quand lui en avait envie il n'a jamais respecter le jugement quand il était occupé avec sa copine nous n'existions plus!!! je peux vous dire quand vous surprenez votre pere avec l'enfant de sa copine et que ce n'est plus du tout la meme personne vous rester sur le cul, quand vous n'avez pas de cadeau pour noel  et que sa copine et son enfant son couverte de cadeaux devant vous, quand ils vous traite de tous les noms et est capable de vous mettre un coup vous et votre mere d'après les mensonges de osn amie, je peux vous dire uqe vous finissez par detester cet homme qui pour vous devient un inconnu mais que vous n'arrivez pas a laisser tomber quand il vous demande de l'aide!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IBwynjDPaa	On souffre tous dans la vie, pour un oui pour un non et on fait souffrir. Moi je pense que tu doit écouter ton coeur et analyse bien ce que ta apporter la séparation de tes parents. et si il est parti c'est qu'il avait une raison.|`|fcd617d083a1fc45a0141b63f13a1339aa	je croit que oui pareceque il n'a rien fait il est juste tombé amoureux d'une autre|`|xRaGyugTaa	malgré toute les souffrances il reste ton père|`|LFbtabOFaa	malheureusement se sont les choses de la vie !!!!les enfants ne sont pas souvent au courant des secrets d'alc?ve de leurs parents....tu dois rester en dehors de ?a et aimer tes parents le reste ?a les regarde........va le voir et dis lui que tu l'aime nos parents ne sont pas éternel et il faut leur dire tant que l'on a la chance de les avoir !!!!!!!|`|Op8CMbB5aa	biensur... c est ton pére.... tu lui dis que tu n'apprecies pas... mais tu l'aimes ! et puis ca les regarde eux... tu n'as pas a te mettre au milieu|`|Xye6yhNBaa	ni aimer ni détester froide ! désolé mon père !|`|v2BAQ7qZaa	sa sera toujours ton padre|`|bffe67b1fc1c02b02c2a80ca97d75062aa	un père reste un père tout comme une mère on ne doit pas faire un choix entre les deux, leurs problèmes restent leurs problèmes dont les enfants doivent eux, rester à l'écart|`|ceShMpBpaa	Même si c'est dur de faire la part des choses (je le sais par expérience), il faut mieux ne pas se méler des histoires de coeur. Son comportement avec ta mère (à moins qu'il y a eit des faits inaceptables comme de la violence ou autre) ne doit pas influencer sur ta relation avec ton père car crois moi,<br>  on peut être un très mauvais mari et un excellent père ce n'est pas incompatible.

La profesora ve que no puede resolver el problema y lo manda para la dirección.<br>  Mientras Jaimito esperaba en la antesala, la profesora le explica la situación al director. éste le promete hacerle un test al muchacho, que seguro no conseguirá responder a todas las preguntas, y así accederá a continuar en el primer grado.<br>  Ya de acuerdo ambos, hacen pasar al alumno y le hacen la propuesta del test que él acepta.<br>  Inicia entonces las preguntas el Director: A ver Jaimito, ?Cuánto es 3 por 3? -"9"-.<br>  ?Y cuánto es 6 veces 6? -"36"-.<br>  El director continúa por casi una hora, con la batería de preguntas que sólo un excelente alumno de tercer grado debe conocer y Jaimito no comete ningún error.<br>  Ante la evidente inteligencia del menor, el Director dice a la profesora:<br>  Creo que tendremos que pasarlo al tercer grado. La profesora no muy segura, pregunta: - ?Puedo hacerle yo unas preguntas también? El director y Jaimito asienten.<br>  Inicia entonces la profesora:<br>  ?Qué tiene la vaca 4 y yo sólo dos?<br>  Las piernas, responde Jaimito sin dudar...<br>  ?Qué tienes en tus pantalones, que no hay en los míos?<br>  El director se ajusta los lentes, y se prepara para interrumpir...<br>  Los bolsillos, responde el ni?o.<br>  ?Qué entra al centro de las mujeres y solo detrás del "hombre"?<br>  Estupefacto, el director contiene la respiración...<br>  La letra "E", responde el alumno.<br>  ?Y dónde las mujeres tienen el pelo más crespo?<br>  El director hace una mueca de asombro<br>  En áfrica, responde Jaimito sin dudar.<br>  ?Qué es blando, y en las manos de una mujer se torna duro?<br>  Al director se le cruzan los ojos.<br>  El esmalte de u?as, profe... contesta Jaimito.<br>  ?Qué tienen las mujeres en medio de las piernas?<br>  El Director no lo puede creer...<br>  Las rodillas, responde Jaimito al instante.<br>  ?Y qué tiene una mujer casada más ancha que una soltera?<br>  La cama.<br>  ?Qué palabra comienza con la letra C, termina con la letra O, es arrugado y todos lo tenemos atras?<br>  El director empieza a sudar frío...<br>  El codo, profesora.<br>  ?Y qué empieza con C tiene un hueco y yo se lo di a varias personas para que gozaran?<br>  El director se tapa la cara...<br>  Un CD.<br>  El director, ya mareado de la presión les interrumpe y le dice a la profesora...

Quando você pensa naquela situa??o e ainda sente ressentimento, ent?o o perd?o ainda n?o aconteceu.    <br>          <br>  Como perdoar? <br>  Perd?o é uma quest?o de inteligência. Quando você n?o perdoa você fica carrengando aquela mágoa com você. Se pergunte: "Se eu n?o perdoar que benefício vai trazer para a minha vida?" Seja sincera na sua resposta e aí está a solu??o para você perdoar!|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	Sim.

3qq89ugaaa	******* é uma prática sexual tornada comum na indústria pornográfica nos anos recentes. O termo é originário do Jap?o cuja tradu??o aproximada é "espirrar água". Foi erradamente sugerido como oriundo de uma prática medieval japonesa onde se castigava uma mulher adúltera, previamente amarrada e ajoelhada sobre uma esteira, sendo submetida à ejacula??o de vários homens. Na realidade teve origem na necessidade que a indústria pornográfica japonesa teve de se adaptar a legisla??o específica. Desde finais da década de 1990 tornou-se um fetiche, existindo produ??es de vários estúdios norte-americanos e europeus dedicados ao género. Deduzidas as varia??es, o ******* é encenado com uma mulher se postando de joelhos e aguardando que vários homens em pé se masturbem e ejaculem sobre o seu rosto. é também chamado de Sexo Facial.|`|ab2f417fb3d99d9b6f4024c28fa29464aa	Pra mim esta é nova... e olha que sempre tento ficar por dentro de tudo.....|`|56c5326644a1e9f7a6bf4646ab889bc3aa	nunca ouvi falar|`|CWttbesGaa	N?o sei o que é n?o... mas confesso que estou muito curiosa pra saber... como será... vou acompanhar a sua pergunta.<br>  <br>  Bjokas!!!|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	Legal q o sonhador tenha nos revelado essa misteriosa prática...  mas agora eu quero saber esse negocio de triplo x tb!!|`|Bakx1KCaaa	Nuca ouvi falar n?o !

Instead of a partnership, they are looking for someone to make the decisions for them, so they don't have to make tough decisions on their own, probably because they are afraid to make their own decisions and deal with the consequences.  <br>  <br>  I don't respect men or women who do it.

Bon déjà, tu es déconnectée d'MSN et tu me manques. Mais il y a les portables :D Bah, en fait, je relirais ?a régulièrement à différentes étapes de ma vie. Je fais ce texte parce que j'ai peur que d'ici une dizaine, vingtaine d'années, l'habitude et la routine feront que j'en oublierais à quel point tu es merveilleuse. J'ai vraiment peur de perdre ce regard que j'ai en ce moment sur toi, de t'aimer différemment. J'ai pas envie de sombrer comme tous ces couples qui ne se disent même plus bonjour le matin, j'ai peur de perdre la passion, cette chose pourtant si magnifique.<br>  <br>      Bref, ce texte ravivera peut-être ma passion si je le relis plus tard. J'essaie, je cherche des choses pour qu'on ne tombe jamais dans la routine (pour le moment, c'est s?r, c'est pas prêt de nous arriver, mais je voudrais, comme toi, éviter que ?a vienne). On en a déjà parlé, toi aussi tu as peur, alors on fera notre possible pour éviter ?a, d'accord ?<br>  <br>      T'es la meilleure amie de ma soeur, je sais que c'est grace à elle si nous nous connaissons. Notre histoire a commencé le 13 janvier 2007, jour où j'ai enfin osé te dire que je ressentais quelque chose pour toi par Internet, mais que je n'attendais rien en retour, que c'était juste pour être franc blabla. Le lendemain, lorsque j'ai lu ta réponse, tu sais à quel point j'ai été surpris. A priori on se connaissait pas, on s'était même jamais parlé. Tu m'as répondu que c'était un coup de foudre virtuel.<br>  <br>      Après deux semaines à parler sur MSN de tout et de rien (mais pas de nos sentiments), on a commencé à devenir accros l'un à l'autre. Je ressentais le bonheur avec toi (je le ressens toujours), nos discussions sur MSN étaient magnifiques, j'avais jamais parlé autant avec quelqu'un via Internet, hormis ma soeur (et encore tu bats son record ). Au bout de ces deux semaines, ta présence sur MSN me manquait beaucoup trop. Ana?s me disait sur Internet qu'elle avait re?u un message de toi disait que tu t'ennuyais. Je n'ai pas résisté : je m'ennuyais de toi alors je lui ai demandé ton numéro. Et là ?a a commencé, trente SMS par jour, la folie... Heureusement les vacances arrivaient.<br>  <br>      On a décidé de se recontrer. On avait tout planifier : on sait qu'on va faire notre vie ensemble, mes sentiments sont sincères, j'ai confiance aveugle en toi et je sais que les tiens le sont. On a les mêmes idées sur tout, c'est dingue. On est en phase tous les deux, on ne s'est jamais disputé, je souhaite qu'on ne le fasse jamais. Toi non plus. On n'en voit pas les raisons.<br>  <br>      On devait se voir le 14 février (pur hasard ouais puisqu'on est anti-Saint-valentin ^^), mais le Destin en a décidé autrement. Pneumothorax, hopital, on s'est pas vu. On a repoussé la rencontre au 19. Et là, malgré la crise d'appendicite d'Ana?s, on a enfin pu se voir C'était beau, même si on n'a pas fait grand chose ce jour-là, sous notre abri-bus, à parler sans rien faire, c'était magnifique. Je ressentais un bonheur fou à être avec toi (je le ressens toujours, de plus en plus !). Le moment de se quitter a été dur. On s'est embrassés furtivement, pris dans nos bras. J'adore être dans tes bras, c'est si magique.<br>  <br>      Bref, voilà qu'on passe trois jours ensemble, tu as dormi avec ma soeur. C'est normal, c'était t?t pour dormir ensemble, mais j'aurais aimé m'endormir dans tes bras bien s?r. Pas grave, on s'aime. Les cours ont repris, on n'a pas pu contr?ler nos SMS, c'était fou. A l'allure de trente SMS par jour, on était heureux. Cinq semaines de torture, mais on se voyait tous les weeks-end. On est vite devenus inséparables. Le troisième week-end, on a dormi ensemble, l'un contre l'autre tout simplement, il ne s'est rien passé et il n'y en avait pas besoin. On était ensemble, tout ce qui comptait.<br>  <br>      A partir de là on a commencé à prévoir plein de trucs ensemble. On essaie de ne pas imaginer notre avenir, de ne rien planifier à l'avance, bien s?r, mais on a décidé de prendre une photo de nous chaque mois, ou chaque fois qu'on se verrait, pour faire comme Noha Kalina dans 40 ans. On s'entend si bien.<br>  <br>      Enfin arrivent les autres vacances (les vacances ci-présentes). Tu es restée trois jours ici encore, c'était merveilleux. Et me voilà là. Nos sentiments augmentent, c'est sublime. On vit le bonheur à deux, c'est fantastique.<br>  <br>      Je veux rester toute ma vie avec toi et je jure que je ferais TOUT pour qu'on soit heureux, et tout pour te rendre heureuse. Tu me connais, il ne me viendrait pas à l'idée de penser à une autre fille que toi, c'est réglé. C'est toi ou personne. Il n'y a pas de vie après-toi.<br>  <br>      Notre relation, je la considère comme spéciale, unique, sublime. On voudrait vivre isolés tous les deux et laisser tomber toutes les personnes inutiles de ce monde. On le fera, en temps voulu. Pour le moment, continuons nos études et notre vie post-lycéenne (dans quelques temps pour toi), amoureux comme on est.<br>  <br>      J'ai écrit ?a, ?a fait du bien, je veux toujours garder ce texte à l'esprit, ne jamais oublier que tu es merveilleuse, autant par ton sourire, ton regard que ton intelligence. J'espère que tu ne liras jamais ?a, ce n'est pas du jeu Je ne veux jamais oublier qu'il faut que je fasse tout pour toi.<br>  <br>      Je t'aime.|`|67b3a291ceba06d04dababd351e4267faa	I miss you|`|79e469102bd35af2ebfe7202c3531dc0aa	Je pourrai lui dire que je l'aime mais elle le sait déjà...<br>  Je pourrai lui dire je te ramènerai ton père d'entre les morts, mais elle sait que je ne peux pas...<br>  Je pourrai lui dire arrête de boire et arrête de te détruire car il y a des gens qui t'aime (je t'aime...), mais je lui ai déjà dit...<br>  Je pourrai lui dire arrête de jouer la salope car l'Amour n'est pas que l'histoire de sexe d'un soir...

Be a gentleman, open doors, pay for things (or at least offer), hold her hand, tell her how you feel. Don't fall for the whole "woman want a strong, take charge kind of guy" thing.

You should just find out her interest if you don't know what they are already. Ask to hang out and do some stuff she likes. Don't always talk about you though, ask her how her day was.

EHuxn9Gqaa	Oi, Anjo Virtual! Engra?ado, eu já fiz uma pergunta parecida c essa e tbm fui mal compreendido... muitas mulheres me taxaram de machista! Muitas pessoas levam para o pessoal o q deveria se objeto de estudo e debate, né?!<br>  Vamos lá a sua pergunta:<br>  Claro que nada é uma regra, mas o que tenho visto através de conversas com amigas, observa??es do que acontece na realidade é que quando a mulher trabalha fora, e é mais bem sucedida q o marido, "descobre que pode ser dona do seu nariz", pode dirigir, pagar as suas contas, e tomar as suas próprias decis?es o que gera muitos conflitos, pois ela n?o foi preparada para tomar tantas decis?es por conta própria...uma vez que num passado muito próximo ainda vivíamos sob uma sociedade patriarcal na qual o homem decidia tudo e dominava". 'A mulher que ganha mais dinheiro, n?o consegue o equilíbrio entre o ser e o ter, ou seja, n?o suporta a idéia de ganhar mais que o marido, e acaba perdendo o interesse por ele por considerá-lo inferior, o que biologicamente poderíamos exemplificar como o macho mais fraco que perdeu a luta para um mais forte e portanto n?o conquistou a fêmea..."<br>      <br>  N?o é a toa q a maioria das mulheres bem sucedidas acabam ficando ou s?o solteiras! <br>  Porém, acredito q isso n?o é só culpa da mulher, mas os homens est?o pagando por um estilo de vida que sufocou as mulheres durante praticamente toda a história da humanidade! precisava suportar certas coisas.

As separa??es ocorrem em raz?o dos casamentos n?o durarem mais como antigamente. <br>  <br>  Antes quem escolhia os c?njuges dos nubentes eram os pais/famílias em casamentos arranjadas, aos poucos essa escolha foi passada para os próprios esponsais (mas tinham que fazê-la de maneira perene pois "casamento era pra vida toda"). Com o tempo e o advento da lei de separa??o (antigo desquite) a pessoa podia ficar sem conviver com aquele c?njuge indesejado, todavia, n?o podia casar-se novamente; depois a lei do divórcio fez com que a pessoa pudesse voltar a casar legalmente, todavia, só poderia recorrer a esse instituto apenas duas vezes. <br>  <br>  Hoje com a atual Constitui??o Federal e novas Leis sobre separa??o/divórcio, a pessoa pode separar-se/divorciar-se quantas vezes desejar, pode ser feito até em Cartório de Notas. Existem, claro outras influências que pesavam na parenidade dos casamentos....<br>  <br>  <br>  Antigamente muitos casamentos duravam em raz?o de:<br>  (i) influencia da igreja, que tinha um controle grande na vida das pessoas, hoje isso já n?o é como antes;<br>  (ii) as mulheres eram todas dependentes do marido, ent?o tinham que se conformar;<br>  (iii) as mulheres n?o conheciam seus direitos como hoje;<br>  (iv) n?o existia aceita??o social pra uma mulher separada/divorciada;<br>  (v) as pessoas tinham mais respeito pelo casamento, quem era solteiro n?o se metia com casados e vice-versa;<br>  (vi) os órg?os oficiais dificultavam ao extremo um divórcio/separa??o, antes s era admitida quando ocorresse adultério, depois foram admitidas outras hipóteses, depois chegou o tempo do processo poder ser amigável (neste o casal n?o precisa ficar declinando o motivo), hoje vc pode fazer divórcio/separa??o até num cartório de notas, desses que existe em qualquer cidade, ou seja, facilitou demais;<br>  (vii) antes um casal tinha um enorme número de filhos, o que desestimulava sair do casamento deixando o outro parceiro(a) cuidando de tantas crian?as, muitas vezes sem condi??es de sustentar-se, hoje nossa pir?mide social está mudando a maior parte dos casais tem apenas 1 ou dois filhos, quando uma expressiva parte, n?o tem nenhum filho, isso facilita a mobilidade matrimonial.<br>  (vii) os transportes e a comunica??o entre as pessoas n?o era t?o desenvolvido, o que n?o permitia uma pessoa mudar seu circulo social t?o facilmente como hoje. Antes acontecia algo com uma garota/mulher numa cidade, nossa isso nunca mais saia do folclore local, ela era a p-u-t-a a galinha etc, hoje isso diminuiu, as pessoas s?o menos visadas pois a quantidade de contatos (em raz?o das comunica??es e transportes) fez com que nossa vida ficasse menos vigiada, existem mais pessoas pra prestar aten??o e isso pulveriza a vigília.<br>  <br>  Acho que é isso, ou seja, um fen?meno histórico que só tende a crescer e longe de deixar as pessoas infelizes, só as deixam livres para persseguir o que entendem por felicidade, talvez isso (felicidade) n?o esteja encerrada numa só pessoa ao longo de toda a nossa vida.... <br>  <br>  Um forte abra?o.|`|U8Nnh9pVaa	Muitos motivos. Primeiro porque a mulher tornou-ne independente financeiramente. Muitas viviam reclusas em casa, lavando, passando, cozinhando, administrando as despesas da casa e o homem (n?o todos) só davam dinheiro para as despesas.  Basicamente era como se a mulher fosse sua funcionária. Com a saída da mulher para o mercado de trabalho, isto mudou, tanto no comportamento financeiro quanto na liberdade de dar rumo a vida. Talvez muitas mulheres vivessem em regime de quase escravid?o, sendo espancadas, usadas e abusadas.  N?o creio que o fato de trabalhar fora aumentou o número de divórcio, mas sim a insatisfa??o dentro do casamento, que agrega outros fatores além da vida profissional.<br>  Jads

j9pInfS1aa	I think as you get older and gather more experience you can really hone in on what a women really likes in bed.  I think when you're in your 20's you're fumbling around a bit, versus your 30's where you really start  to learn what works and what doesn't.  The key is to listen and not be afraid to try new things.  A women will tell you what drives her wild, it's your job to take that and go to the next level with it.  In you're 30's you actually start to learn some of the things that at 20 when you thought you knew it all!  That's when it becomes "great sex"  and you can never get enough of that!|`|260b6f69284c5ed3b6aee67d55545216aa	There is nothing magical about age 30. There is medical evidence that women reach their physical sexual peak around age 32, while males usually reach that point in their early twenties. HOWEVER, people in general tend to become mature enough by that age to cease the game playing, become monogamists, gain new found respect for their partner and all of these things contribute to a higher threshold of living and loving. Sex is a big part of loving and loving is the real icing on the sexual cake.|`|26e7e8e066934a1ae789bc417c603c9caa	43 and still going strong.....and still wanting it.|`|4aa5ec2b493db915bb99fb24d191aa9baa	It's not that sex pecks at a certain age, it has it's ups & down's, like everything else, actually those of us who had kids before age 30, would say the early 30's, was not the best time,(too tired), 40 is good for women.|`|AA10378323	yes, very true!!!|`|AA12018289	You have a good point.

This girl is telling other kids because deep down inside she is hoping someone cares enough to get her help.|`|AA10293793	tell. right now. tell your parents right away and make sure they are getting that girl some help.<br>  i know she made you promise, but she wouldn't have shown you the cuts if secretly she wasn't asking for help.<br>  she may be mad at you after you tell. but think about this. would you rather have her mad at you for a while or dead?|`|GICa9AWAaa	If you think that she is seriously doing that to herself you not only should but NEED to tell.Normally I agree that a promise is a promise but when it comes to committing harm on yourself that can have serious consequences(like death) you need to be a true friend and help her.She wouldn't have showed you if she wasn't looking for help.<br>  Now she will most likely be mad or even hate you at first but an angry friend is better then a dead one!|`|JP7Dfm4faa	You need to tell someone - She may be VERY hurt however you would be doing the right thing as a friend.  You concern shows that you DO care about her --- Secondly she WANTS to get caught!!!! SHE SHOWED YOU!!!! You need to tell someone who will take this seriously - and not brush it off.  Someone very close to me is a recovered Self Injurer - and telling saved her life.  There are many programs out there that can help.  Your friend is calling out for your help.  I apologize if I sound dramatic - I just know even if she never talks to you again getting her the help she needs is 100% unselfish.  You will always know you cared enough to help even when it was a hard choice.  Define you character now!<br>  <br>  I can't believe it Carlito Beat me to it again!!! He has a great response!!! Which I didn't touch upon but fully support- don't go telling everyone you know - respect her privacy by getting her help!|`|Q4E8C3Zuaa	You should tell a family member of a teacher because this person needs help.<br>  <br>  It's breaking a promise but you would be doing it for the right reasons. The girl is unhappy and needs help.|`|iQ6zeK5gaa	this person is obviously and admittedly depressed, sure if you tell you may be breaking a promise but think about what happens if it continues. Slitting of the wrists could lead to more severe things which in the best case scenario could get your friend hospitalized and in the worst case scenario could lead to even more suicidal behavior

0c2c45171d7db6c7348146272c585442aa	I had to smile when I read your story.  I have been chatting online for some years now and I have met a lot of turkish men from my experience, they start out very nice and always end up with sex as their main conversation.  In one program I use, I read a lot of profiles and in the profiles, there are a lot of women who pleaded for turkish or any other people from the arab countries not to contact them or show them pictures of their private part.  I went to turkey last year and I saw that there are a lot more men that women there.  At night, when you look at the people hanging out at the parks (all night), they are all men sitting around smoking cigarettes one after the other and it seems they don't have a wife or family to go home to.  I found, however, that the ones who are more open with sexual conversations are from the larger cities like Istanbul, Ankara, Ismir and such.  The others who are in the more religious areas like Trabzon, Rize, etc. are not like that.  Personally, I think because they know that America is more open minded with sex, they feel that is all we want to talk about.  They see all the videos there with half dressed girls and all.  They look at a lot of American music videos.  Well, you can tell him you really like the person he is, but you would prefer not to have sexual conversations.  Also, when he tells you that he loves you, it is not love, it is only that he want to let you think that so he can come to America.  I say this because I see it happened over and over again.  I am not saying every person there would do that, but the majority would.  If he is really a sweet person as you said, he will respect you and drop the subject, but if not, then you need to let him go his way if it bothers you that much.|`|AA10375363	thats cuz they not allowed to have sex in them arab countrys over there..so u getting used with cybersex|`|e629cc9258052589a7797bd6b9dca36caa	Tell him you don't like that kind of conversation.  And no matter how many times you check out and make sure someone has a full myspace profile, that doesn't mean that they aren't pervs.   He definetely is one.  Good luck.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	I guess he has shown you what he's all about- sex.<br>  He's not a "sweet ingellient" guy- he's a pervy little horndog who is probably letting his friends read your x-rated chat. He only pretended to be nice so you'd be lured into providing him with free, sexually explicit chats. <br>  Tell him to get lost. If- for some insane reason- you don't want to delete or block him, keep refusing his demands for sex and he'll be done with you soon enough because he's probably about 52 years old, fat and with 7 kids.<br>  PS- don't believe what people post in their online profiles. You have no way of knowing if any of it- including photos- is true.|`|AA11083259	And you thought he was hangin' around for the intellectual conversation.................<br>  <br>  Mr Happy<br>  :o)
EuA8iKG2aa	i think that ultimatley it is really your decision, and none of us can really know the right answer because we do not know you or the circumstance very well. But i would tell you that once youve done it, youve done it... theres no going back. There is no need to be in a rush about it because you have the rest of your life to do it. And there is other things that he can do to you, that feel almost as good, and wont get you pregnant if you catch my drift ;) either way just make sure your ready and your safe when you do end up doing it. good luck girl :]|`|b85a5e09fd9386ad9b6f62e438ace558aa	You shouldn't have sex until you're completely mentally prepared to do so. I regret my first sexual experience at 15.  If you really are in love with this guy and trust him with something as big as sex, and you are being safe and on birth control and using condoms, then go for it. Otherwise,  its a bad idea.|`|mwewiODzaa	your only 15 and personally, i think that is way too young. and i also think 3 months isnt enough time to actually know the person you're dating and how do you really know that you trust him? my advice, is do not. it could really change your relationship, and maybe your life. wait because you have so much to learn about relationships, and your life. i mean your 15, with a boyfriend for 3 months, so you dont know much about him or having sex. that is just my advice and opinion for you. i hope you make the right choice =)|`|n4CuyLu9aa	Do what? Go to the movies?  A walk in the park?<br>  If you mean sex the answer is NO!<br>  <br>  Ask yourself this: How bad do you want to be a mother at 16? Or get some dreaded STD you will never get rid of.|`|d38f4c564ad84d348c0660a16d2d8dceaa	first of all... my husband's 15 yr old cousin just had a baby... so i don't think you should be doin that right now anyway. if i were you i would at least wait until i'm out of high school... and believe me i have a 6 month old... and girl it's hard...  but if you don't want to take my advice please make sure that YOU are ready... don't let him talk you into it and please make sure that you are protected...|`|75b701681e36bd3d8587f81aedde23aeaa	Ok.. if your asking random strangers on the internet if your ready.. clearly you arent.<br>  <br>  If your ready (and dont belive in a religion that tells you to wait until marraige..)  you will know.  Your first time is so so important and will be something you remember forever... do you really think this is the guy?<br>  <br>  Keep in mind if it is.. if you are ready to have sex you should be ready to have the talk with him before about the important of protection etc.. if you cant talk about that your not ready.<br>  <br>  Your a little young.. i suggest you really really think this trhough.|`|5yx5Htohaa	Well, my answer changed when I saw your age. 15 is too young to be having sex. I know that this isn't the answer you wanted and you probably don't think that 15 is young. But unless you are just completely mature in every way, then you're not ready. Three months is an OK time after seriously dating someone, but not at your age. Sorry.

Si al menos te hubiera dicho cómo es la verdad, y te dijera qué le sucede, o te pidiera ayuda. pero parece que él prefiere drogarse a escondidas tuyo, osea, que ademas de adicto, te oculta una verdad, y grande.<br>  A tu edad, creo que entras en tiempos muy vulnerables a la droga, y si te enriedas con grupos de personas adictas..es probable que alguna vez te tientes.<br>  Primero asegurate que sea cierto, por qué no lo hablas con él? de paso ves su reacción, en el caso que sea cierto. Ves qué intenciones tiene él de recuperarse, por ejemplo.<br>  Por otro lado, en el caso de que él sea adicto, y aunque digas que lo amás y te sientas con la capacidad de ayudarlo, lo único que pod′rias hacer es "acompa?arlo" en la recuperación, que él mismo deberá decidir, y hacer. Vos no sos motivo para que él deje la droga, el principal motivo debe ser éL y sus ganas de estar mejor, y amar su vida.  <br>  Lo de mantener una relacion a escondidas de la sociedad , me parece la peor opción, y hasta un poco telenovelera, disculpame, repito que no quiero ofenderte. Sos chica aún, te quedan muchos a?os y muchas relaciones por vivir y muchas experiencias.

And stay away from that guy who obviously is jealous.|`|5IKcLNk7aa	Girl, he probably is upset or confused because you're going out with his best friend and it sounds like he has a crush on you. because his two best friends are going out with each other and one he has a crush on.

kwsDyKrCaa	Como o meu pai sempre diz: "Nem todo dia, é dia de sol. Há dias em que a chuva cai!"<br>  Ent?o, amigo, é simples: as rela??es humanas nunca ser?o perfeitas. Qualquer rela??o humana é difícil. Os altos e baixos fazem parte da sucess?o natural dos acontecimentos da vida. Se todas as rela??es humanas fossem perfeitas, a gente n?o teria um Bush, um Osama, os traficantes matando inocentes no Rio de Janeiro, nem políticos despreocupados com a miséria do povo.<br>  E outra, procure ser você mesmo. Inovar n?o consiste em mudar o seu jeito de ser. Pois como vc mesmo disse, chega uma hora em que n?o dá mais. Inovar é reciclar nossas atitudes. Como vc fará isso, ja n?o me convém dizer, pois isso é algo que exige uma adapta??o particular a sua própria realidade.<br>  E esse seu medo de falhar, como em dizer algo que fa?a quem vc ama se afastar, é normal. Mas procure superá-lo. é pelo medo perder, que vc perde.<br>  Inseguran?a bota tudo a perder.<br>  Como eu disse a uma outra pessoa, ainda a pouco, digo novamente:<br>  N?o existem fórmulas para o amor.

I wouldn't put a lot of energy into trying to get him to say it, he is already showing it and action is louder than words.  I assume that you hug him back...try adding an extra short squeeze at the end of a hug before letting go...you can do the same when holding hands.  These two things will let him know your feelings without you saying a word.|`|AA10733221	If he's your best friend, sit down and talk to him honestly.

Take this chance and ask him if he likes any other girl. You only thought he likes this other girl but it may not be true. But if you do not want to get hurt, do not fall in love I think. So I advise you if yo do not want to get hurt, then don't do anything and carry on as normal. If not, ask straight to him how he feel towards you and at that point, a lot of things changes and you two may not be pretty good friends again. So take your time and think what you want to do.GOD BLESS U
a17c6e9e08ff2ce2b6cb26ecf028e87aaa	The anus is full of nerve endings, in both males and females.  It can be a very exciting erogenous zone for both, once you get over the social stigma attached to anything to do with anything anal.  It has NOTHING to do with being gay or straight, and anyone who says otherwise is an idiot.  It appears that it just feels good to him.  Nothing insidious about it.<br>  <br>  Addition:  Jareth makes a very good point about cleanliness.  My lover and I just use condoms on his penis or any toys, or latex gloves for digital stimulation.  Also, if you are going to insert your finger(s), make sure your nails are trimmed.

And as long as you don't feel uncomfortable with it, go ahead.<br>  <br>  One thing you should be careful about, though, is not to put the dildo inside yourself after it was in his anus because the bacteria there are not good for your vaginal flora and can cause some problems for you.

Is there a question?  Or are we to assume what the question is?<br>  <br>  Why do we think people think you are a homosexual or bisexual, when you dated a girl that looked like a boy?<br>  <br>  If you're not a practicing homosexual and you haven't sexperimented in homosexuality, then I guess it is the way you carry yourself that calls it into question.<br>  <br>  Other than that, what people say, "Doesn't make it so."  If you're straight, it's all just wind.  If you're out there practicing homsexuality, then maybe you should be bothered that someone is outing you.<br>  <br>  Some women feel safer around practicing homosexuals so you may get an in.   "if you weren't gay, I'd snatch you up in a minute."  "Funny, I'm not gay, your place or mine!!!"<br>  <br>  For some strange reason, Society has to put a label on everything.  "He's gay, She's a lesbian, She's a tramp, He's a mimbo.. Metrosexual."  <br>  <br>  Maybe that is what they consider you.

126a12353e14f4a4871a94b49726d9a9aa	Bodylanguage is a big clue.<br>  <br>  If you catch them looking at you a lot. If you are talking to them and they lean in toward you. If they smile a lot at you. If they touch your arm or shoulder when you are talking to them.<br>  <br>  The best way to tell though is probably to ask them.|`|32a8e3a19ed991c0adc6d161cbdc58feaa	the moment he tells you.|`|AA11769816	If they don't come right out and tell you, then I would say looking into your eyes with a constant smile on their face.  Holding you close to them without trying to put the moves on you.  Enjoying your company and spending time with you just talking.  I think if some one touches you and kisseses you is a good determining factor also.  If it is like those hot scenes you see in movies where the people are just ripping each other's clothes off, they probably just want sex, but if they kiss you slowly and tenderly and hold you tight then there may be emotions involved.|`|941d6c0bc972604af722f67dcf7b4f2aaa	By the look in the eyes..|`|AA10375363	by asking,,but not just that cuz they could be lying|`|dde945220f8a8879e73fe600580169caaa	Willys cynical thought for the fugging day;<br>  <br>  You can't make anybody love you you can only let yourself be freaking loved!

92ceeab8cf73f8badebb88492219f7e1aa	I think most people would consider this to be cheating. No you aren't going out and actually doing it, there's still that feeling of betrayal. I would suggest that you stop doing it, so that your partner doesn't find out and end up getting angry. If you enjoy doing it, try doing it with your partner, you guys might find out a lot of new things about eachother. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1dea38a5e03c5fc0875cac0ae2840062aa	i would say yes just for the fact that if he finds out then he is going to be freaking out.

4606a4e6eaa278d426a8ab734e1651e0aa	Some times the best friendships turn into the best relationships...have a friend casually find out if he is interested in you the same way that you are interested in him. Either that or just confront him yourself....but that usually makes things awkward. Have your friend say something like, "hey you know what would be interesting?...you and so and so as a couple" and leave it at that. Although make sure it is a mutual friend so that it flows a little easier...Good luck!|`|878524ca5e9e0d81e45cdc714f998088aa	You should just be friends.

Someone who would keep you on his mind for 3 years, and buy you everything, seems to me hes a nice guy.

If you know what i meen. <br>  <br>  I say give him a chance, and see what happens. On the other hand, if hes a jerk, bad grade, trouble maker type, id say drop him like a bad habit, and tell a councelor about your situration.<br>  <br>  -James

But on my 15th birthday, I got this funny feeling that something was going on. I went over to her house and asked her mother where she was. Her mother told me that she was at her friends house. When I made it there, I heard some noises up in her friends room. I went inside and walked up into the friends room. It appears that she was having sex with my best friend. <br>  So, if you think something is going on, then take care of it before something happens.|`|bc5d72413be3bba879156ef8dcb7d849aa	Oh he!! yeah, but I've never followed him.

871f7fa67c8108bafa51b291597bccb8aa	You have to be very careful with long distance or online relationships especially being from two different countries.  If this man you say you love, asks you for any money, or asks you to let him borrow any money...dont do it!!  There are many people both men and women who meet on line from different countries.  They say they love you and would do anything for you, but when it comes to asking for money (what ever reason they give you), it is a scam.<br>  <br>  If this person is a true person, I would suggest that when you have spring break from college, that you invite him to come and visit you.  You are in college so I know you cant afford to spend out extra money to travell to visit him.  This is one way you two can get to know eachother up front and in person.  <br>  <br>  Please do not jump the gun on this one.  You need to make darn sure that this person you have a relationship is a real person.  You can get his name and address and do a search to make sure it checks out.

He needs to finght for partial custody.  that way he won't have to pay so much child support and he will be able to see them half the time at least but other than that- there's nothing you can do. Why don't you talk to a  family affairs public deffender and see what they tell you.  But- he needs proof that she parties so much that she doens't care for her kids.
cd4facfabbe9f3181d3eb2aba5693595aa	Yes very much! Nothing better than a little doll that you can play with.<br>  If you hadn`t noticed nature made women smaller than men.

He can get visitation and have it monitored until he passes enough drug tests to ease your mind.  --Until then, just say she is sick... She is going to a bday party today, gramma's etc... and she is really looking forward to it.. lie lie lie!!!|`|AA11097598	The simple answer is no child support, no visitation rights for your ex. Go to the court and see about the legal moves that need to be done and seek legal aid. <br>  <br>  I know of two other families in the same situation and both men (losers) haven't paid child support or seen their children in many years. <br>  You are right to worry about exposing your child to this. Can you talk to your ex's parents or siblings for help?<br>  <br>  It will hurt your child not to see her dad, but he is following a dangerous path and your daughter's safety comes first. You need to be her mother and father for now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3f1db15e3b6ce261ebfd4157b5571c75aa	Most states and counties have legal aid programs. It is based on your income. If you feel that your child is in danger, I would stop the visitation and get proof. If he wants to take you back to court over the visitation, he will have to deal with the child support. Your attorney can ask the judge that he be subjected to court ordered drug testing. You could also talk to your areas prosecuting attorney and express your fears to them. They may put him under investigation and hopefully find the proof you need. Remember, your child is the one who is most important here. It is your obligation and responsibility to protect that child at all cost. If he threatens you, call the police and file an order of protection against him. He will have to stay away or go to jail.|`|4815d55767acda3385a0b36bab8a48f1aa	If you have no proof their is nothing you can do. If I were you I would put all my effort into getting some proof. I realize you have no money for an attorney but that is what it would take to do anything. You could just not let him see her but you would be breaking a court order and if your ex wants he could take you to court over that. Will your ex take you to court? Well if he is a drug head like you say probably not. He will want his money for drugs not a court battle. Really think about this before you make a decision about it.|`|5OtWHH5Uaa	You need to contact social services and report this to them that you are concerned for your daughter welfare.  That way it is document and they are obligated to do a welfare investigation.  this way you are also protecting yourself because in the eyes of the law you could be charged with endangering your daughter by permitting this to carry on.  It is a ruff place to be in and i do not envy you.  But for the safety of your daughter you need to take action, as a parent who is on drugs can not be a good influence to the said child.  If he is not paying child support report this also, maybe you can hold some leverage over him by no pay no see.?  Check it out please, I would hate to see somthing happen to your child.

You will find a girlfriend when not so childish. Also don't be shallow. Looks help but would you like a girlfriend who is beautiful outside and a troll inside? Look at the whole package not just the wrapping.|`|jWYQgdjraa	Go online and google or yahoo "How to be romantic" and go from there.|`|c8jSHhQZaa	It depends on what kind of girlfriend you want. Dating is a serious mater, so if you want a real girlfriend you might just have to grow up a little. That doesnt mean you need to change who you are. Theres a difference between the fun loving crazy side of people and who they really are inside, you just need to lower one of them in order to  get what you want, because girls arent usually interested in the childish side of guys but the real thing of who he is deep down inside.         Of course you could alwase look for a girl thats also childish  though I doubt you'll find one.    I know how you feel because I once was(still am) beyond childish. I mean like completely crazy...but in a crazy funny way.  But even I know the importants of being myself and keeping the childness low.  Hope that helps.   Good luck:)

As you said, he has been devoted to her for ten years, and suddenly she says, "I'm bored of you. I want a new lover." He is NEVER going to take her back. He has just wasted ten years on a woman who will dump him at the first sight of another guy.<br>  I know that you're going to say it's innocent, or maybe even that they're just friends. However, her boyfriend is never going to listen to that. He is going to leave.<br>  What she needs to do is sit down and seriously consider what is going to happen. Does she want to lose ten years so that she can have the initial thrill of a new relationship? If the answer is yes, then she doesn't deserve ten years of devotion from her boyfriend.

So dont worry . and dont think that you are the only one can do the mirricals.

You will not be faithful, nor will you do anything other than hurt her. Your problem is that you want someone else to make this decision for you, rather than do it yourself. This cannot be done. You and only you can decide to be faithful, true not only to yourself but to her, and be able to accept the consequence of any decision you make. I would remind you though that in all cases you've cited, the one person you have always gone back to is her. Either because of the comfort of that situation, or because you love her, or perhaps you like to feel guilty and have someone appease that guilt. You might also look at what you're afraid of, there must be some fear that is driving this problem you are having. At any rate I would examine your real feelings, true meaning of the relationship, and either get out or stay, make a decision and stick with it.

e3L70zOqaa	Je dirais : non (hélas), il n'y a pas de recettes miracles.<br>  La confiance en soi, c'est quelque chose sur le long terme. Si tu es timide et peu assuré, tu ne pourras pas changer d'un seul coup. Mais tu peux y travailler.<br>  Quelques trucs :<br>  - entoure-toi de gens qui t'aiment sincèrement et qui peuvent te soutenir : des vrais amis. N'aie pas honte de leur dire que tu manques de confiance et que tu as besoin de soutien. <br>  - réalise que la plupart des gens portent un masque, et qu'on a tous des angoisses et des moments où on se sent nuls et incapables<br>  - le manque de confiance en soi, c'est souvent une peur de déplaire et d'être rejeté ou mal-aimé. Or, c'est souvent aussi un sentiment un peu "parano" ; pourtant, dans la vie, les gens accordent souvent un "crédit" : je veux dire que tu peux déplaire à, ou décevoir, des personnes qui comptent pour toi sans que ?a diminue l'estime ou l'affection qu'ils te portent. SI tu n'as pas ce genre de "crédit" avec tes amis, c'est que ce ne sont pas des vrais amis<br>  - le manque de confiance, c'est aussi la peur de "mal" agir : l'erreur est humaine, et c'est en faisant des erreurs ou des actions imparfaites qu'on apprend et qu'on s'améliore. Si quelqu'un te dit "tu es nul", c'est lui qui a un problème, pas toi. Si tu fais une erreur, que tu te trompes, que tu fais un mauvais choix, ce n'est pas dramatique, c'est la vie. Tu es forcé de te tromper à un moment, et même à plusieurs.<br>  - fixe-toi des objectifs à ta portée, des petites résolutions, et concentre ta volonté dessus, jusqu'à les accomplir. Plus tu accomplis d'actions de ce genre, plus tu auras confiance en tes possibilités.<br>  - si tu es critiqué, ne prends pas la critique spécialement dirigée contre toi; demande-toi "est-ce que cette personne est "autorisée" à me critiquer (un prof, un supérieur) ? est-ce que je peux changer quelque chose ? est-ce que ces remarques ont vraiment tellement d'importance pour moi ?"<br>  - si tu échoues quelque part, pose-toi la question "est-ce que c'était vraiment important pour moi ? est-ce que je suis responsable à 100% de cet échec ? (bien souvent, en creusant un peu, tu verras que non) est-ce que ?a m'apprend quelque chose sur moi et est-ce que je peux en tirer des le?ons ?"<br>  - répète-toi tous les matins ceci (c'est tiré d'une interview de Jacques Brel, et je trouve que sur le coup, il n'a pas tort) :<br>  "Il faut se tromper, il faut faire ses erreurs, il faut se casser la gueule, il faut avoir mal, il faut pleurer, il faut être en-dessous de son oreiller... Le fait d'exister, le fait de bouger me para?t plus intéressant que le fait d'être prudent... Il faut être imprudent... Et vous vous cassez la gueule ? Eh ben, vous vous cassez la gueule.

De mon c?té j'avais compris "qu'est-ce qui empêche une femme de n'avoir qu'un seul partenaire dans sa vie?" .

D'un point de vue plus hédoniste, si le mec est nul en bisous, caresses, tout ?a tout ?a, elle aura probablement envie d'avoir du plaisir au bout d'un moment, et donc le risque de succomber au charme d'un autre pour soulager sa frustration.|`|2fb28f53a1381e33d4726fb0bd07ee08aa	Pas grand chose mais c'est souvent compliqué.|`|8258dba9f17d856922809a78d7c600b2aa	Rien|`|FS1yKYfCaa	Le fait qu'il n'y a pas un homme qui l'aime.|`|V88Z85vVaa	l'insatisfaction|`|deECQdcyaa	Les préjugés des mecs!|`|eee8bd1fd33c205d36c23052457ac385aa	l'infidélité!|`|746321a668cdcefb295da7af79cfb846aa	la conscience,si ?a ne la dérange pas de tremper et de trahir,c'est que sa conscience est absente donc rien ne l'empêche|`|LBAFShxLaa	rien, <br>  uniquement sa conscience et son envie.<br>  Dans ce domaine  chacun est libre des ses choix, il suffit juste d'assumer ses actes et ces conséquences.|`|nXT16eAIaa	Elle n'est pas une fille sérieuse

ua8HhBJHaa	Sounds like to me your freind is bitter, and also hungry. If he lives in the ghetto with his Grandma they probably dont have alot of money, especially money for food. He is acting out because he is probably embarressed by not having food so he steals it so he can eat. Do you have a teacher you can confide in or a parent where you can explain the problem to them? Someone needs to help him before he does end up in prison. He does need counseling and if he and his Grandma are doing without they need help. What do you do for lunch? If you bring your lunch can you bring extra for him? Continue to be his friend and keep letting him know you are worried he may go to prison if he doesnt stop acting out. But try to find a counselor, teacher, or parent you can confide in. Like I said, to me he just sounds hungry.

E n?o falo de intimidade pra transar e sim intimidade de saber despertar sem falar o fazer e o receber. Sexo oral só é bom quando bem feito. Eu amo fazer, mas nem todos sabem fazer em mim, entende? Se é um relacionamento amadurecido ambos podem falar... pq n?o pergunta a ele o que é FAZER direito na concep??o dele? E ele? Te satisfaz no oral? Homens gostam muito de receber mas n?o se preocupam em fazer. E se voce está com  vergonha, tem algo errado aí. Gostar do namorado é uma coisa, estar apaixonada é outra, ve direitinho, viu?

OkTQpUzZaa	I have had a date before to pry into my personal life, and unfortunately, I gave answers - wish I hadn't because I did feel uncomfortable.  I like what you did with that guy.  He had no right to continue to bother you about what you did for a living.  It's good that you let him go.  From my experiences, I have learned not to give in to nosy guys.  On the first date, guys don't need to learn all about us - whether it's our secrets, regrets from the past, or just where we work and what we do - if we are not comfortable telling, they should leave us alone about it.|`|Nsj2UbTaaa	How in the world are you going to get to know someone without asking questions? <br>  I guess you just want to talk about weather and politics. <br>  Good luck.

6b1bf199d9dadda3342dac8a3aab92f5aa	from looking at your profile i can see you are a very good daughter and sister..some times things go wrong between parents and they forget what is really important like you...if you can't see your sister right now.try sending her cards [ you can make cards] or drawing her pictures of you and her ,if she is to little to read..even if she can't understand this maybe her mother will..and if not ,sometimes putting things on paper can make you feel better..keep a book for her so that when she is older she will know you think of her regularly.nothing to Fancy just things you think of when you think of her......let your dad know how much you miss your little sis....you sound like a very good person, sometimes it takes parents a little time to realize what a great kid they have,maybe he will catch up to you  some day......|`|11a36bde0e608795e056b375d1e3b306aa	sooner or later thing will work out.

tIvBf49faa	He could just be a good friend.  If you want to know, you can always ask him. Communication is the best method.|`|pT2wPhT1aa	my guess would be yes since you two have been friends for a long time. Then again you two can see each other more of friends but maybe you two can see each other dating and going out to dinner and have fun. Usually guys are nice to girls they like but then again I'm nice to all girls who respect me.|`|Syn6WhZBaa	yeah he does.|`|dXXStRxQaa	Well, I don't really know.<br>  All of this can mean he only has affection for you as a friend, a really close friend that you're first one for him to come for help, you know. Since you guys are friends for that long, how can he be mean to you? And he's probably just one hella funny guy. Guys here always crack jokes. And since he knows you for a long time, and hung out with you most, he might just think you're a very reliable friend out of all he has had, so he tells you things.<br>  These signs aren't the most convincing ones, but...keep trying and notice some more.|`|mQuoqE4Yaa	yes sure bu the real question is do you like me?<br>  <br>  well do ya?

What is most important is focus on what your looking for and you will attract that into your life. Every-time you think why isn't this girl this way or that way or what does she want tell yourself OH that is my reminder to switch my thinking to what do I want cause clearly this situation is not what I want.<br>  <br>  Best wishes..........|`|6oZNuoX2aa	depends on the woman...she might actually be looking for good time, sex, def. wants an educated person who can take care of her...and others looking for their future husband|`|zvDXhj3Uaa	Sex.. just like you...
uEL0pkN4aa	When you are getting close to being intimate.  Of course, you have to figure out for yourself how you define "intimate".  Some people do it before sex, some before petting.
W3HQwrgBaa	Sure there are! All men aren't pigs.|`|dtYddk3Paa	no but they are men not boys, all boys want sex no matter what they say.|`|55wzYORgaa	Depends. Rarely guys are decent. Most are hormonally driven and two-faced about their attitudes towards sex. (Typical is the guy who tries to pump every girl he dates but only wants to marry a virgin). Part of it is the girl too though.  Dressing like a slut will get you treated like one. I laugh at the girls that show a mile of cleavage and have a slit in there skirt almost to their hip and then get mad when guys gawk.
juRWvc0eaa	tell him. It will eat you up if you don't wondering "what if?" At least if you tell him you'll know the answer to that question.|`|09F2lhKZaa	Tell him you want to go to the  neaxt level.

4oDKd1gZaa	to be honest a guy will always have LOVE  for their ex girlfriends no matter what... but but after a while that love becomes care and the new love will be you if you play your cards right...|`|jRByIEXxaa	You should probably just end it.  If he still has feelings for her and would go all the way with her, he'll probably go back to her eventually.  Just end it so as to not cause anymore heartbreak on your end.|`|IGbLNqEAaa	Just ask him if he does have feelings for his ex.  If he does i think you need to end it. Would you want a guy who still thinks about his ex? If you notice that he keeps talking about her just confront him because if he still has feelings for his ex then maybe later when he makes up his mind you two can actually start going out for real.|`|iumRf6z4aa	If you really like him, give it a shot.  It's natural to be hung up over someone.  He'll get over her eventually.  Don't just end it because he 'might' still have feelings towards her.  If he's that open with you, you could even talk to him about your feelings, if you're not as shy as me.

And WHEN he meets someone HE loves, he'll leave you. So you'll have lost time & happiness. do you want that?|`|e0686f9e8480e310f74e1723a838b41faa	give it a little time. if it goes no where find some one else.|`|e3P0f2Jaaa	well if that person doesn't like me and i like that person i will ask if we can be friends or i will try to make that person love me.

If you tell her that you don't want to be friends anymore and that you want her to leave you alone then just let her start the argument and don't sweat the  small stuff. If you guys get into an argument and end up never talking to her again than your goal is accomplished and you don't have to hang with her anymore, problem solved.

And the "selfish" comment sounds like she's trying to say that she needs you there and thinks you're thinking of your needs and your happiness...which you are, but I don't necessarily see that as selfish...you're just trying to be the independent adult that you are!  Just talk to her and tell her that she's spent 18 years raising you and teaching to be independent and make good decisions and this is the time in your life for you to finally get to put that into practice!  Remind her that moving away from her and making a life for yourself and following your dreams does not mean that you're writing her off and don't love her anymore!  Some people are afraid of change, but change is inevitable!  Just stand by your decision and tell her that you don't want to leave on bad terms with her, but you wish she'd trust you enough to be able to make decisions concerning your life!|`|35b41910bfb06e071630bf7b9672e64daa	Well I really don't know for sure if your mom is trying control you. <br>  <br>  Try to look at it from her point of view:<br>  <br>  1. You are moving - I don't know how far but you will be moving out your state it seems. She won't see you as much and that is hard for a mom or any family member to deal with. <br>  <br>  2. You will be 18, on your own & far away: She most likely is worried about how you will handling being on your own. You'll have to work and stuff like that. She won't be near if you need help. This is scary for her I am sure.<br>  <br>  3. You will be moving in with your boyfriend: You mom may feel this is wrong. She may want you to be married before you move in with a guy. She may not like or even know your boyfriend so that too scares her. She is worried for you. <br>  <br>  So please don't see it all as control. Look at it from her eyes as I described above. It is scary to see your child leave the house and live on their own. She knows you will make your own mistakes and it is hard to deal with that. She too made mistakes growing up and knows how hard it is when that happens. <br>  <br>  Remember she is your mom but she is human. She feels happy, sad, she worries and has fears. So you need to understand that. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Plus I see your point of view. I got married at 18 and my parents moved to another state over 6hrs away less than a week after my wedding. It was hard and scary time. I was THRILLED to be away from my mom.  Boy I FREE finally!! Yet I felt lost and scared. So I understand you wanting to get out of the house and live on your own. I've been there.|`|CtVLaAZRaa	Because she is your mother and brought you into this world. She sacraficed 18 years of her life to raise you. That is how most mothers react when their children leave.<br>  <br>  Try not to be mad at her or think that she is controlling you. Try to reassure her that you will call her frequently and will visit her. Let her know she is welcome to come visit you whenever she wants. She probably isn't happy that your first move of independence involves moving in with a boyfriend either.<br>  <br>  So try to have a little understanding and give her the benefit of the doubt. She probably loves you very much and is upset that her girl is now an adult and is finally leaving home.|`|qmLjEXlDaa	It a parents job to protect, cloth, educate, feed there children. No matter how old you are you still are her child.  Moving in with your boyfriend and going to Florida with no job set up is not very smart.  How long do you think the money you have will last?  Do you have any idea of the pay scale and coast of living is?  I don't think you thought this through.  Also what is the boyfriend bringing to the table other then his bags?  <br>  <br>  If you were smart you would learn from other peoples mistakes rather then look to make them yourself.  Your mother is right..|`|HDbU6hUyaa	maybe because she knows that it will be hard for you, especially in FL, I lived there so u will be miserable.

Think about it before u do it.|`|LJtGKiG5aa	Well if your mom is flipping out abuot it it's just her job as the parental to take care of her children it's the "motherly instinct" besides i think really waht makes her so worried is that your moving in with your boyfriend...so many things can be running through her mind such as what is gonna happen if nothing goes right?? and etc. see all these things come with the moherly instinct. I thinks it's just best that you sit down and talk with her (including your boyfriend) and show her all your plans and what you will be doing or where you will be living. believe i was in the same situation as you and since my boyfriend and i have talked to our parents they are more trusting of us. I just hope it works out for you too|`|VmaURmFLaa	You got to realize, THAT IS YOU MOM, she birthed you raised you and wants whats best for you.  Not to mention she would probably miss you.

Not to mention you are only 18, i know you want your independence but **** stay home as long as you can, mortgage and rent is a *****.|`|ahfqcazSaa	Im sorry to say,Coolies, but your mom is right, take it from me, I studied and finished High school in Saudi Arabia, Finished Medical school there (if your saudi, its free, as long as you have a 95% and higher average in High school-that was long, 8 years of Med School) ,so I wanted to come here (Canada) to finish my residency and fellowship (Medical Steps) and my mom (when I proposed the Idea I was 29, not 18 years old, 29) went crazy and said no, in the end, she gave in, she knew I was old enough,so 18 is probably too young, and shes afraid you might end up on the streets.|`|mFAb4YbHaa	she will miss you....

Y8meWKiQaa	You were not wrong in what you did. You had every right to want your mom to do the driving and if you don't want to, you don't have to go anywhere at any time with him. If he treats you with anger and violence then you should not be around him at all. He has no right to treat you in that way. It was very immature of him to say that he would buy a CD for himself and pretend it was from you. It was very childish of him to say he would go out to lunch with someone else who loved him more. He was very wrong in his actions and it is inexcusable. He is supposed to be the parent and he acted like a spoiled brat that should be spanked and sent to his room until his nasty attitude changes. If you choose not to see him for a while, that is okay. You did nothing wrong. Keep telling yourself that. Please don't feel bad for what happened... he brought it all on himself. And if he didn't take the cookies that you made for him then it is his loss.<br>     The love of a child for a parent is unconditional and your parents should be doing everything in their power to nurture that love,,not destroy it.<br>       Have a long talk with your mom and ask her to help you decide what to do. <br>        If you are afraid to be with him, then don't be with him. it's your choice. Be brave and don't let him bully you.<br>     You take good care of yourself.<br>  Fernie...|`|S3V9Y6iXaa	I have one Question for you what happens when you get in a car accident with your mom are you going to start taking the bus?  Either way you hurt his feelings and I don't know how old you are but things will change when you get older you see things different.  Just make sure he knows you love him.  He also sounds like he needs anger mangement.  Don't feel to bad he should get over it.|`|BwzcEQcRaa	No  He doesn't deserve to be called father. Especially when he treats you the way he did.|`|XgDIXwaRaa	I can see where yours coming from. But i also see where hes coming from. I think he was just trying to put all that bad stuff that happened behind and have a nice day with you. He shouldnt have reacted in that way thought. Considering what happened before he should have understood you though. The next time you see him just say sorry and maybe we can try again. But maybe you can meet him somewhere rather than him driving you.
AA11965302	No , I think it's HOT !|`|51cf947451c9f22ff4bacbbcdd97893aaa	nope..|`|Utq2ulkqaa	uh...i think thats weird.

kRyXzRqoaa	If you broke it off with her, then she's thinking that you don't want her, you did it!!! If you want her, then tell her you made a mistake and go from there.|`|da66ea04f04f3ada3e5c95fabeda46daaa	She is probably hurt that you broke up with her so shes is trying to put you out of her mind which means giving her space to come back may not work because if she doesnt know you want her back she doesnt want to seem desperate or clingy. So what I would do is say...." I've been thinking alot(girlfriends name), and I think I made a mistake by wanting to take a break. I understand that I hurt you by why I did and I know know that what I did was a mistake. I cannot take it back but I can tell you that I am willing to wait and give you the time and space that you need until you think you can forgive me and try again. I know it doesnt come as much comfort but I didnt realize what I had until it was gone." Being that you are the one who broke it off you have to do the groveling. But those are almost the exact words my boyfriend used on me and now hes my husband so I know it works. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.|`|RgdTgHMuaa	You should be forward. Since you state that you took a break from he, if your feelings have changed, then you need to let her know. Standing by and waiting for her to come back may leave you lonely, because if she doesn't know how you feel, and that you really care, then she may not wait for you, and she may move on.|`|8z1DZFqcaa	if u left her just go up to her, apologize, and tell her what you think. If she left you i am clueless. This is just what i would do.|`|RSBq36r4aa	Do you know her feelings for you? If I were her I would like to know how you felt about me, the relationship and it's possible future.<br>  <br>  I had a situation sort of like this. My bf broke up with me because a serious relationship was something new to him and he was scared. We both went our seperate ways for a little while but we both still had feelings for each other. I never knew and I never would have known how he felt about me until he told me. Now we're together happier than ever!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|UntGbEzaaa	Pick up the phone now and leave a message. Most likely she will not answer. Leave another one. She will probably answer after the fifth message. Then u will see her point.Take it slow and listen more than you speak. Be compromising. DO NOT TRY MEDIATORS.|`|YJJTROtBaa	u should tell her how much u care about her and go from there...
mHdXF0E0aa	I did this.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if I had it to do over again - I would do it differently.  I would stay where I am at, have a talk with the other person to see if they had similar feelings for me as I have for them, then make a plan to be apart for a while but make the effort to see one another.. say six months.  If you last through that period - then talk about one of you moving.<br>  <br>  If you are stable, why does she not stay with you in your country instead of you being the one to move?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope it works out.  Love is one of the priceless things in life.<br>  <br>  Livia-|`|146622f4cb6968163ba15138cbad40bdaa	I did this ...not the moving thing but the scrambling up my life..I thought someone thatsayed and showed they cared for me would always stay that way..In my situation things got worse until metal abuse is now the factor... I wish I had made a different decision.<br>  Think things out good before making a drastic decision.|`|1fizRjZnaa	Ask her to stay, and tell her how you feel.|`|87ca460c099c354081436982fd5ebe99aa	This answer is to the question:<br>  <br>  Would you scramble up your own life to be with the person you loved?<br>  <br>  I would absolutley. I love my b/f of 3 years with all my life and I would do anything for him, including moving half way across the country if need be.<br>  <br>  But that is just me, its not for everyone.|`|csc5QGGVaa	Only if you ask her to marry you and she says yes. <br>   Really? Estonia? I personally would rethink the whole deal if I were you...but that's just me. Whatever you think is best is what's right for you. Who cares what Yahoo's think!|`|5b80eba9df3ff310fa27cccb86a9f4f5aa	It depends on how much you know your gf. I've had a lot of girl friends who left everything for their guys...and it turned out their guys ended up not being all that great of a bf or husband in life. If I were you, I wouldn't do it. Soon the love you had for that person will fade away and you'll meet someone new to take her place. If she really loves you, why doesn't she stay with you? I just think it's more practically for a girl to leave everything for a guy then it is a guy to do it for a girl.

REfeGqgjaa	yes, it is ok to want to date older guys. it is not a crime so just ignore them they are probably just jealous that you have a bf and they don't or they just care about you so much they are just trying to protect you from all the creeps out there in the world.|`|22361ccf499011b738729419c55cc7fdaa	Can we say, AMEN?
REfeGqgjaa	some ways to keep her are to just show her you love her and call her every night. and the times you do spend together make sure that they are memorable by like taking her out to dinner, walk on the beach, watching the sunset together and just saying i love you. and if she loves you as much as u love her things will work out and you will always be together.
P32Njah5aa	O jeez story of my life here... um it's hard.  Because you don't know if they like you the same way, and you don't want to mess up the friendship you have.<br>  <br>  I just tried to give her more attention than my other friends that are girls.  I joke around with her a lot.  Whenever we're having a party or getting a group of friends together I would be the one to ask her to come etc.  Just little things.<br>  <br>  Usually we never give away anything obvious... if your friend and you have other friends around usually they'll pick up on it way before you do and they'll scamper back and forth between parties asking you if you like each other etc.  Trust me this crap still goes on even when you're in College.|`|Oq7hpPJWaa	iv been told that the guy will pick on them.....treat them like 1 of the guys|`|afccac613f0e39a32a7c14e40cec9291aa	Since you ask, here's a kernel of wisdom from me, a senior lady who's been there and done that (many, many times !) and I hope you'll always keep this uppermost in mind whenever in a relationship with the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  Guys will say _anything_ they THINK  you want to hear that will endear themselves to you, whether or not they actually truly mean it.  Guys of all ages just don't have a clue about how to be equal partners in male/female relationships, nor do most of them really go out of their way to try to understand the female of the species.<br>  <br>  Guys, basically, are geared to be the "hunter-gatherers" and we females are what they hunt. To capture a female, they use any means necessary. To hold that female in relationship with them, they will do whatever it takes (and I use "whatever" in the very broadest of terms).  So while we females think a guy's genuine when he whispers sweet nothings in our ears, be assured, please, that the sole intent and purpose for those words are simply to bed you and as many other of us as they can.<br>  I've been around a lot longer than you, my dear, and have heard every sweet word more than once, have had my heart broken numerous times until it became clear to me that this is indeed the case.<br>  Despite their not having a clue, and being controlled by their "dumbstick" (just as it's said that we females are by our emotions), I still love men and the attraction will always bring male/females into our lives. Just use both your heart and your head to see what's right in front of you. And for God's sake, when a guy says he's a creep or anything else negative, BELIEVE HIM !|`|2QjJ8VBIaa	idk but mi best friend is a guy and he has a g/f but he talks to me like a whole bunch more..so idk really...does he make u happy wen u r sad that is one thing...he does that to me

Just live life in the moment.|`|y5wT6Tzoaa	Just say it. Make sure you mean it though if your with the right guy theres no wrong way to say it.
Cd5avmhWaa	Normally when a guy treats you like that or talks to you like that it means that he likes you and is trying to flirt with you. I think that he likes you and if you like him than all you can do is try. The worst that can happen is that he says no and that's only bad for a little while. I think that during your next phone chat with this guy (whether it be that you called him or he called you) you should just casually bring up the fact that you and some of you friends are going to see a movie that weekend and you wanted to know if he would like to be your date. I think that if it is meant to be than that would definitely be the best way to approach it. Good Luck to you!|`|XlVldaz1aa	You just need to talk to him seriously and ask him how he feels about you. If he is serious about what he's been saying then tell him you feel the same and go from there. Then ask him what he's doing this weekend and tell him about the movies. Ask him if he'd like to go if he isn't busy.  Most likely he'll say yes so you take it from there. It doesn't sound slutty to ask someone to the movies, just be yourself. Good luck and God bless.|`|zoMK7pypaa	Why not? Tell him that you and some friends are going to the movies if he'd like to go along. No harm done!!! Good luck. Just calm that shift finger down:)

9827f1b9a2d14d4f7bd881623b64fe4caa	Keep praying.  Let God help your friend to fulfill His will, if your friend won't listen to God, than he's going to have a harder time listening to you.  Don't end the friendship forever, how about letting it rest for a month or so?  Me and one of my friends got mad at each other and put our relaionship down for a while, and now we get along very well!  better than we used to.  Just let him and his girlfriend do their thing, he'll clear up in a while, they all do, and when he does, you'll be there for him, just like hold times!  =D ?|`|yAvTxh47aa	" pray everyday but afraid that my friendship is over"<br>  <br>  Maybe he feels like you're a religious stalker, and is letting you down easily rather than start a big scene with you.|`|NvBHVpgjaa	I don't think it could be the girls fault completely, seeing as how your friendship as had such a slow decline.  You need to talk to him.  Your friend needs to -and you need to make him- hear you out.  Your friend needs to realize that he needs to make time for both of you (GF and BF[best friend])  Having a girlfriend is different then having a best guy friend...so he maybe just living up a new experience.  Keep trying to talk to him!  Make sure you do it when you're alone too!  You can also try talking to the girl!  Maybe she can help!  Good luck!  Don't worry, you're completely right about this...and you're the one thats going to have to fix it!  Never give up on your bestfriend!!!

It shows your to interested. Think small and grow.
AA11753383	yes. it's weird. like, there's this guy i've only seen three times, yet i feel like i've known him for such a long time. and this other guy, who's his best friend, i feel like i've known him forever. and i've only seen him five times. i guess over the past 2 yrs, because i have his number, and i've messaged him and he's called me before quite a number of times, it makes it seem like i have known him forever. and his best friend, even though i have only seen him three times, we have got to spend a lot of time together and therefore have gotten close. and not to mention my best friend. i feel like i've known her forever. i've known her since seventh grade, and it's because we've shared so much together that i feel like i've always known her|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	Yep, and I married him.|`|JtZs7fAtaa	Yes!|`|321d5e2da2cd6bd10a0f864e974bbefeaa	Yeah but then he met someone else he felt like he knew forever and they wound up f*cking forever on my couch while I was working aparently.|`|e6574bbe31f57e75ba9ef98aaf06686caa	Yes, definitely.|`|v14wtX8iaa	yes and its cool when that happens!|`|9b701ee514d98413099a7f9a981d4a9caa	yes its creepy and cool|`|TwhYypZ4aa	yes one of my frends hes like a little version of my older bro its king of freaky|`|fe5a4af928ae62bdbc687f2290889024aa	yes|`|ijsplBW3aa	My manager. Ive actually only have know her for 2 months but i feel like she's my sister and she says the same. i really don't want it to go beyond friendship either due to the fact she has a boyfriend for 5 years and i have a girlfriend for 2 1/2 years. its truly a weird feeling but once it happens a few times you'll get used to it.|`|mz58uvooaa	YEAH! its kinda creepy
425f119e758cb01622605767d69fdaa7aa	I used to get really jealous over the small things and that would make the bigger things even worse, but one thing I have learned over the years is this - jealousy is nothing more that someone's own insecurities about either themselves or a particular situation - that is in some cases.<br>  <br>  I know that when I go boating, I do get jealous when I see my friends with big expensive boats and I am in my own little crappy thing, but I also realize they work hard to earn there money and that is their choice to spend there money on a big boat, me I'm happier spending that money with my family.  <br>  <br>  I've made some mistakes in my life, but that is all a part of learning.<br>  <br>  Don't let your jealousy eat you up, it is really not worth it.<br>  <br>  And thanks for the points on my last question - you are right age does not matter.  However you should realize that you have your entire life ahead of you and at such a young age you shouldn't limit yourself with an older boyfriend right now.|`|0WDtGyDXaa	Dont Be Jelous Avoid It !!!!!!

There is no "bad or good", "yes or no" for this question. No one here can say anything, because the fact is, we ALL get jealous. It's human nature. That's all there is to it.|`|owZn2Y8Kaa	No it is bad for any relationship because you are actually telling people you do not trust them because why else would you be jealous
GGEjc0xmaa	Yeah, cook for him, give me more sex, put on some lingirie once in a while, keep him happy, talk to him, don't critisize him, be more supportive, let him go out with his buddies once in a while.

It was awesome.  I really recommend taking the class if you can.  As you might gather from the title, the idea is becoming more aware of each other's needs.  We tend to try to meet our mate's needs based on what *we* think is important... while what our mate really values is actually completely different.  So - your husband could be trying to meet your needs based more on what he would think would meet his needs.  Once you take the time to sit down and go through the book, it really helps.  It helped us.  I would strongly recommend the class... try their website at www.familydynamics.org.  I don't work for them or anything - it was just great for us.|`|cIZ5XEvoaa	Try to understand the difference between "Love" and "needs." If your disabled, seek physical care from professionals, not your husband. Respect and Love your husband and you'll get it in return.

I always answer for my boyfriend a couple days after we've fought and we've both cooled down. If she's really serious about it and she won't answer, text her and tell her that you're sorry and that you love her, and that you want her to call you when she's ready to talk. I know she told you not to, but wouldn't you rather know that you did everything you could instead of letting her just slip away?

Express your feelings before they even get a chance to call you a friend.
0iGDNXp9aa	Do not set out to find a best friend. Just become friendly with several people and it will happen. People like to talk about themselves. Ask  questions when you meet somebody. Think of this word: FORM. Ask about the person's Family. You can begin writing some of the questions you may ask a person about his or her family: Where did you live as a child? Did you have any brothers or sisters? This gives you an opportunity to share a bit of information about yourself, but don't monopolize the conversation. Then move on to another Family question......Think back to FORM. You're ready for the O. Occupation. What kind of job do you have? Did you go to college? This also gives the person you're with some time to tell you about him/herself, and perhaps will put the person at ease enough so they can ask you questions. FORM. The R stands for Recreation. What do you do for Recreation? Do you go to a gym? Do you like to go to ball games? Etc. The last letter 'M' stands for Motivation, and is, perhaps, the most complicated subject. "What motivates you in life?" What is there in your life that drives you? That keeps you going? Or is there some cause that you are pationate about? Such as curing the environment; stamping out child pornography; feeding the hungry. Or is something as simple as living life to the fullest? Be prepared to answer that question yourself.        You must get to know a person very, very well, and they must know you very, very well to earn the privilege of becoming a best friend.|`|qbg2eSSBaa	Perhaps if you learned to spell properly, people would want to talk to you. Right now, your spelling is incoherent, which is really sad considering you're writing on a computer.|`|6Cq8x16Faa	no way too desperate|`|u8dZnXyjaa	don't look for a friend, if you look they might not be sincere. they will come if you are a nice person who people like to hang out with
juRWvc0eaa	If you believe there is a chance, then you need to find out. I would hire a PI to follow your man. One thing is that you will have to prepare yourself for the chance that he MIGHT be cheating. Seems like you don't wanna believe that, but usually when one suspects it, then it is true.The Key here for you is to know, for no other reason than peace of mind. Hire someone to get you the answers you need.

AA11539135	A girl who...is open, honest, true. A girl who is modest is a lot better for a man than an immodest girl (in my opinion). I go for a girl who is strong in her faith, but is willing to grow. But i think honesty and integrity is a huge part about the attractiveness of a girl! Now i am really only talking about "emotional" characteristics, but there are physical characteristics too. If you must know them, just email me. Just be your self...and then a guy will find you attractive...i am sure of it.|`|HygCmU0qaa	attitude, and face... why do you have to ask only dedicated christian guys in the first place?? what's your reason???i mean point????|`|juRWvc0eaa	In all honesty, someone who does not make Believers out to be high and mighty snobs... While I understand you want the opinion of Believers, there is also a BIG difference between one who is Forgiven, and those who think they are perfect.<br>  In all honesty attempting to force the teachings of Christ on anyway is only going to push them further away.<br>  So to answer your question,a woman that is real, knows she has as many faults as I do, and one who will leave judging me up to the Almighty.|`|yyn7nFKWaa	is there a difference between a christian and a DEDICATED christian???|`|IRUpJeTtaa	some things that attract me to a girl is she has to go to church,has a plan on what to do with her life,she has to be smart,nice attitude,and a outgoing person.|`|M5JGPdmbaa	Personality, sense of humor.

That is what sisters should do for each other.|`|0tcpfav5aa	The belief is that when someone dies the soul goes to God in heaven. So, this is good news that the soul has found rest and comfort in the bossom of the Lord.<br>  So why the need for one to cry when the soul is in heaven and not in hell?<br>  Besides, the more one cries over the loss of a dear one the more the soul becomes sad and worried so the best we can do for our departed loved ones is to give them our good wishes and wish them well in their next assignment.|`|CqSyC3Gkaa	by her a barbie doll|`|hffW7Uy7aa	I can't really say that I know how it feels, fortunatley, I've never had to go through that.

uNazz3HLaa	Men say that they don't mind, and "Wouldn't it be great if she'd make the first move?", but the truth is that they like to pursue us. We become more valuable to them if we make them work for it. You give them anything too easy, or are too available to them, and the novelty wears out for them very quickly.

I think maybe you just want to have some time to yourself, and that IS important.<br>  <br>  My friends call me all the time, and I don't answer usually because I just want to relax and chill.<br>  <br>  I don't know what exactly your case is like, you didn't give much background info, but I think you just need to relax for a little while and recharge your battery.|`|9ETsVHQfaa	No, nothings wrong. Sometimes you just get into a kind of slump. Relax for a little while and then just sit yourself down one day and take a look at what's bothering you. Maybe it's nothing and your just feeling pressured for no reason or maybe you're trying to avoid something. It's cool, I went through a period like that too. Sometimes you just don't feel like dealing with things.|`|P2sZXK72aa	You could be experiencing depression. Maybe you're afraid of something thats out there.

CkN4pgpCaa	I would say about 3-4 months before the wedding.  If you go too early, you may run into the problem that I did- we went to Target and Macy's and there were a lot of things that we wanted that ended up going on clearance or being discontinued- and we had to go back and pick out new items.  Most people will wait at least until the invitations arrive to buy you a present- so there's really no rush.  If you want to, you can start earlier, like the 6 months that some people suggested.  Just keep an eye on your registry and be prepared to make another trip if some of the items are no longer available.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I would register at least 6 months before.  That way you have time to go back and add things or make any changes you want.  Also once the wedding gets closer you will have a lot less time to do things like register, so it is good to get it out of the way as early as possible.|`|884v4VhGaa	I'd do it soon, but don't rush. If you do it too early too many things will get discontinued and you'll have to go select replacements. HOWEVER, if either of you has a birthday coming up then people might appreciate having the registry to come up with gift ideas.|`|Wdl9SA9jaa	At least 4 months before your shower|`|B5ayu80jaa	get yourself to vegas. do it all in 1 day.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	just do it sometime before your shower, or before the invitations go out, whichever is first.|`|7z1l4s4Yaa	I would say 6-8 months before the wedding - good luck and best wishes! =)

Also check out fashion magazines for what colors they say are hot for that season.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Navy or Royal Blue with a cream, you could go with earth tones like olive, khaki and linen shades or more vibrant with gold as an accent.

Whenever you think of that person you seem to shiver and get another shot of that "loving feeling". You feel high and the world could be destroyed for all you care. Love is such a wonderful thing, it is so special, I only had that real "love feeling" once in my life.|`|AA11279082	That's the big question, the ultimate prizewinner!  There's attraction, chemistry, a good fit, etc.  But it would seem that, without "love", none of the other stuff matters!<br>  I believe it was Helen Keller who once wrote: "We like someone BECAUSE...we LOVE someone ALTHOUGH!".  That always stuck with me!  Here was a woman whose only senses were touch and taste, and thanks to some patient and brilliant people, she became a college graduate, an author, a philosopher--but she NEVER had the ability to judge a potential mate by either hearing, speech, or sight!!  To me, she was one who could love, and love TRULY!!  As for the rest of us, we have to rely on senses she could only dream about!  And we "gifted people" have baggage from our past that only sighted, hearing, and speaking people can carry around!  <br>  In short, after all of my rambling about Helen Keller, I do believe that we all are capable of love, some much more than others.|`|Ff7lRKHiaa	Love is a strange thing people can not fully understand it but i would say it is a good thing but sometimes drives people to do crazy things<br>  <br>  NOTE: a crush is different then love<br>  Love can help heal broken hearts<br>  real Love never does anything to hurt other people<br>  <br>  Hope i Helped|`|AvmKTcJNaa	It has a forever changing meaning that takes work to keep it.

Its more of an understanding between two people. And with that understanding there is an affection between those two people. There's usually one but not the other, and that is why people don't stay together forever it seems. <br>  When someone says true love, it is when you really want to be with that person forever, and understand them and don't really care about their flaws. And also there has to be an understanding of the other person's feelings too. You just can't play with someones feelings and not expect them to hate you. <br>  I know it doesn't seem like much but its a whole lot to give to one person.|`|VMQdLNIcaa	Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br>  <br>  Love never fails.|`|zVrSFBgkaa	the best and worst feelings you could ever experience|`|AA11423026	Eros: The Love of Pleasure<br>  <br>  Storge: The Love of Parents<br>  <br>  Philia: The Love of Friends<br>  <br>  Agape: The Love of God|`|EZyHOht7aa	Its only in fairy tales and movies!!

The more often you're on it, the more your profile will appear to others (depending on how the site works, but most tend to work that way). And give it time.

Sometimes it takes time for someone to say hello.  Do you have a picture?  There are some who will only respond if you have a picture.  Some sites I found better responses than others.  I was on over 7 sites by the end of 9 months, so I can say what I feel about many of the big ones.  I can also say when I did not get much response on a site, before long I joined another and another.  The last site I was on was the best, easy to use, friendly and fun... I also met my new husband there.  So give it time and say hello to a few men.  Do not just wink, some like a written hello or such before they respond.

ZzM0ndVLaa	okay here's the deal, all people are shallow on some level.  as for the viscious cycle, it is up to you to break it. do you want to be called fat? do you want to be depressed? do you want to get fatter? the question should really be, are you confident enough in yourself to not care what others think? if you are happy with yourself it will show and naturally the people who accept that will like you for you and look beyond your physical attributes and or what you lack. beauty is not only skin deep but also what is on the inside. if you feel good you look good. instead of grabbing a spoon for the ice cream, decide to get over the rejection and get back out there and grab another. like ice cream there are many different people out there, not all of them are the same. you have vanilla, chocolate, rocky road, ice cream with sprinkles and so forth.<br>  <br>  i hope that helped. good luck. <br>  |`|pmUxfl3haa	don't worry. <br>  beauty is in the eye of the beholder, buddy. <br>  life's too short to be depressed for forever. <br>  she'll come along one day :) |`|cHCH6ORGaa	LOL boy are u wrong girls are just as shallow mean ignorant as any guy|`|5w6DXtJHaa	That's not true.

VN3WlVL0aa	Younger people have a tenancy to think that elderly people's minds are more fragile and therefore treat them like children. Unless this elderly person has a history of mental/emotional illnesses, it is rude and irresponsible to treat them like they are children.<br>  <br>  Elderly people are stronger than most; they have seen more and been through more. So feeling sorry for them seems insulting. I understand your feelings.<br>  <br>  ?Doomwyte?

IbhX8kHxaa	I seriously have no clue :o(|`|dHPA390Qaa	The state issues the couple a license.  It should be applied for in the county of the ceremony.  Your husband can perform the ceremony, and it will be considered a 'civil' ceremony due to him not being clergy.  After the wedding he is responsible for mailing back to the county clerks office- they will file it.<br>  <br>  It will 'hold up' because it is the state that actually give the couple the license to marry.  They only need to solomnize it by saying their vows.

ACecbVghaa	Stay home with your new baby. You'd love to go and that shows how much you care for your friend. However, a 6-week-old baby is far more important at this point - and you are assuming everything goes fine with L&D too and you're up to it. I wouldn't assume anything, i would respectfully decline and stay home and recover and bond with the baby. Congratualtions and best wishes!|`|q8eue7CRaa	It'd be very hard to be in the wedding party - your friend will understand. You could fly alone if you could afford it (and if you can bear to be away from the baby for a day or two from the baby). So, either go without the baby, or just rsvp as a no and send a nice gift. She's your best friend, she'll totally understand why you can't come!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Since this person is your best friend, could you try to drive and bring the baby along?  If you are a stay-at-home Mom or on maternity leave at that point, time off shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  I would definitely not be in the wedding, but I'd certainly try all possibilities to be in attendance.|`|884v4VhGaa	I'd say that you shouldn't try to be in it. A lot of women expect that the bridal party will be putting in time/effort to help pull off the wedding, and you shouldn't be expected to take time away from your baby for that. I'm fairly sure she will understand. <br>  <br>  If there is no way that you can bring the baby I'm fairly sure that she will understand why you can't make it. I know you said that you didn't want a lecture on nursing, but I agree with you that it would probably screw up the breastfeeding. Expressing just doesn't work quite as well in terms of keeping your production at the right levels.|`|u4FIwBNWaa	I am just wondering why you wouldnt be able to bring your baby on the plane with you? There are no restrictions on that.  I just wanted you to know that, good luck!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	you pretty much can't do it.  your friend should understand.  if she invites you as a guest, as a nice gesture, rsvp with regrets and send her a gift.  I don't think you can stop and start breastfeeding, and weaning a 6 week old would be terrible.  besides, do you know how much $$$$ it costs to be a bridesmaid?  new mothers don't have that kind of dough.  dress, shoes, hair, makeup, nails day of wedding, outfits for rehearsal dinner, bachelorette and shower, gifts for shower and wedding, pitching in for cost of shower, it basically never ends.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	If this were somebody I wasn't close to, I'd just stay home.  But if it's my best friend, I'd make every effort to be there.  I drove to my best friend's graduation 6 hours away with my 3 week old baby because it was important to me to be there.  So I suppose I'd fly and take the baby with me. But that's me.  <br>  <br>  You have made it clear that you aren't willing to drive that far and you aren't willing to take your newborn on a plane.  So you have two options; either go to the wedding, leaving the baby behind with a trusted family member or friend.  Leave enough breastmilk for the time you'd be gone, and pump while you're away to help maintain your supply.  Or don't go at all.  Stay home with your kids and send your best friend a nice card and gift.

OFJFLs2Paa	Well I can't tell you how to get over it but sometimes people say more than the truth. Maybe a guy might say hi to her or something and she likes to make it better by adding things to it. Also another thing that you can do is not listen to her when she starts talking about that. Tune her out like I tune out people just sing a song in your head or think of something else. It will not be a big deal or another thing is tell her that you don't like when she keeps telling you all these stories she tells you. Good luck!

Just don't overdo it. Tell them more about the things you don't get i guess, because according to that girl, you get everything so show them that other side. Or when you do tell them that you're getting something you want watch your tone, you don't want to appear pompous and make everybody feel like theyre lower than you. Well i dont know the extent of your relationship so i can't say anything but from my own experience, i fight with my best friend all the time. But i know if she is pissed off at me, then maybe i should reflect to see how i was acting. Cus i know she doesn't get angry easily.

U8FRgrTjaa	moi j'aurai tendance à dire non, si c'est sa personnalité et que la personne à besoin de s'exprimer et bien qu'elle le fasse. C'est sur que ?a ne plaira pas à tout le monde surtout ceux qui veulent garder une grande partie de leur indépendance, dans ce cas les personnes ne sont peut etre pas faites pour etre ensemble... suffit de trouver la bonne personne qui acceptera avec plaisir toute déclaration d'amour.<br>  Après trop s'exprimer peut aussi faire peur à l'autre surtout si c'est trop rapide et que l'on sort d'une grosse déception. Tout dépend du cas.|`|YbzqKMBfaa	qu'appel tu trop exprimer ses sentiments au juste car c'est tres vague, cela dépend des personnes.... et leur vision de voir les choses..<br>  <br>  tu sais pour certaines personnes trop exprimer ses sentiments, c'est tout le temps dire je t'aime, téléphoner, ecrire des petits mots ou poemes...<br>  Moi je trouve sa cool.<br>  <br>  Je suis une personne qui exprime ses sentiments, et je ne sais pas avoir une relation avec une personnes qui les concerves..<br>  je me poserai tout le temps des questions, tendis que lorsque tu es avec une qui les exprimes c'est genial je trouve, car tu le seras directement lorsque sa va mais lorsque sa ne va pas non plus et la c'est la communication donc tout bon.|`|zcbpWFMqaa	Oui-Oui...?a fini par  para?tre mécanique....<br>  |`|vLK5KOsCaa	oui, si les sentiments ne sont pas partagés.|`|e97bc2be0fea27899096f3ee329aa755aa	peut-on lui en vouloir de ne pas s'exprimer?|`|vwTehz0baa	sincèrement non car moi j'ai des difficultés à les exprimer justement !!! lol |`|gm3uG70faa	Il existera toujours des sujets introvertis et extravertis|`|xRaGyugTaa	il faut exprimer ses sentiments pour ne pas avoir de regrets |`|dff1ec9c8cf7b6ab755e5b5c8fb6c649aa	oui car des fois c 'est trop trop trop !<br>  mais dis toi qu'une bonne discussion regle bien des choses
JhXUzeIGaa	you should tell her! having kids is amazing. its a different type of love you will never ever be able to feel any other way. its great. maybe yall can have a little one! good luck!! and you would be a good dad no matter what :o) as long as you are there. and playing with them in the backyard sounds like a good dad!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	 Dreams of playing with  with happy children is one of the worse reasons I've ever heard of for having a baby, unless you have been thinking about it in your conscience mind and it spilled over into a dream. You said you didn't want  children because you wouldn't be a good father. Unless you are likely to abuse a child every  one wonders if they will  make a good parent. If you have not changed your mind about having children there is no reason to tell her about your dreams. If she already wants kids that will become a positive omen to her. If you have changed your mind, and not because of dreams, than by all means tell her about the dreams and you're ready to be a father...........................  THEN HAPPY DAYS IN  YOUR HOUSE.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	People change their minds all the time. Give it some more time, see if the feeling sticks with you. Spend some time with some friends or family with children and I mean some real time. Go away for the weekend with them and the kids. And make sure you get a full range of age groups. Because babies are different than toddlers and preschoolers and schoole aged. Then if you're still feeling it, talk to your wife.<br>  <br>  My almost 2 yo can grate my nerves like no one I've ever met, can make me just want to smack her with that sassy mouth and attitude. Then she climbs up in my lap and hugs me or tells all her little daycare friends. "Thats my mommy", or tells me, "come on come on", to follow her and sit down because she wants to snuggle with me. When she looks to me for confirmation, or comfort, or anything; she just steals my heart.|`|HGRBtDIiaa	i never ever wanted kids, but suddenly, for some reason, i keep thinking about getting married and having a kid and starting a family. i even have names picked out! what the hell! i don't know. i guess these things just change over time.|`|e0CLBKqJaa	You should tell her! She'll probably have an open mind. You have to decide together. You two are a team now, tell her whatever's bothering you|`|Z2NLFBOFaa	tell her! :D|`|0Id85yiYaa	you should definitely tell your wife. you never know, she could feel the same way.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	The guy my niece married said that he didn't want kids, he too didn't think he would make a good dad.  He later changed his mind and now they have 2 wonderful children.  A girl and a boy.  He is the cutest dad, you should have seen him when he dressed in a suit and took his 6 yr old daughter to the Daddy & Daughter Dance.  He coaches soccer for his son's team.  Here is this big ole lug on the floor playing with his and everyone else kids these days.  Yes people change their minds and yes I think that you should talk to your wife.  This is something you two should think about again.  It sounds to me like you have changed your mind.  Believe me children are gifts.<br>  Red

N?o vou dizer que você vai encontrar alguém com quem sonha, a realidade é diferente, a vida n?o é feita só de amor, beijinhos e noites romanticas, tem dias em que o outro está com problemas, tem dias em que a gente acorda um pouco indisposta ou que um faz sem querer algo que acaba ferindo o outro e na real é nessas horas que você percebe que encontrou o amor da sua vida, quando um tá mal, o outro acaba cedendo e vice-versa, sempre resolvendo tudo na conversa, sem discu??o, bate boca, xingamentos ou dizendo palavras pra ferir, porque quando o amor é verdadeiro, é nessas horas que a gente toma mais cuidado ainda, pra resolver as desaven?as sem ferir o outro e no final o amor fica mais forte ainda, a delícia é essa, ver que do outro lado tem alguém que se preocupa demais em n?o te ferir!<br>  <br>  Indico o filme O diário de uma paix?o, é simplesmente lindoooo!<br>  <br>  Boa semana!!!!|`|7U6YCd7Iaa	N?o existe ninguém perfeito, por isso é melhor se contentar com um homem bem real, que assim como todos,também tem defeitos.... n?o pe?a o impossível<br>  O que pode fazer é encontrar alguém romantico, mas perfeito nunca,porque n?o existe...<br>  Boa sorte!!!|`|BfjYDrzjaa	Pode esperar porque com certeza seu príncipe vai chegar...eu demorei bastante tempo, tive vários relacionamentos, tentei criar o meu príncipe fazendo outros serem como eu queria que ele fosse, mas quando ele chegou foi um amor à primeira vista!!!!!

Nós mesmos n?o fazemos isso, e as vezes n?o é nem querer... é n?o poder mesmo!

O resto é conversa fiada!!!|`|FObinpA9aa	Sempre se dá um jeito. mas a dica é achar o equilibrio. um tem q ceder, outro tb, de maneira em q cada um consiga entender o outro e respeitar as opinioes.  o Amor supera tudo. o Amor nao precisa de carro, mt dinheiro, de 24hrs por dia, filhos proprios,  ciumes doentio. <br>  <br>  uma bicicleta, onibus, uns trocados no fim do mes,  uns minutos por dia, ou um dia por mes,  filhos adotivos,  ciumes controlado entre outras coisas, sao boas alternativas q só se resolvem com uma boa conversa e compreensao . sempre tem um meio termo. achar q é a quest?o.  <br>  <br>  Abra?os.

wmOgseCgaa	Money problems are difficult to deal with...believe me I know.  If he is unhappy in his work and feeling unfulfilled then he is most likely taking it out on the only person who is there. You need to speak with him and tell him you understand his frustration but you can't be his whipping boy and you won't be! You do the best you can and he needs to appreciate that no matter how much he hates his job.<br>  <br>  My hubby gets the same way. We have similar occasions until I put him in his place and he always apologizes.|`|83e88ed838a191390143729b74e4366caa	sounds like marriage to me :S<br>  <br>  there are always ups ands downs ESP with young children<br>  <br>  Try to remember the other person is stressed, and remember that you are too. If you try to look at your relationship with forgiving glasses it becomes forgiving|`|516395a6433d85af848b97a4efa6b46caa	no, he's taking his tiredness & frustrations out on you & that's not fair. even though he works hard, it wouldn't hurt him to pick his own clothes up off the floor. can you try to get him to understand that he's adding to your workload & that by having to pick up after him you can't be doing something else! it's one thing to understand someone's behaviour, but quite another to constantly live with it. if it continues, it will get you down so much you'll want to escape to someone who will appreciate you more. i'd see if i could get him to understand that. good luck with it, hun. Diane.|`|d34bd9835ee66c010e4181f78ed0c53aaa	You both need to calm down a bit then have a heart to heart, really talk about why these stresses are getting you both down then act on the result of the chat, very often we just need to know the other person cares about us, by the way when I get out of my tree (oh yes I admit I do) I flounce off to the bedroom my hubby just leaves me for a while then pops his head round the door and says would you like a hot drink? depending on mood it will be yes or no, if yes the storm has passed and I go out for the drink and everything goes back to normal.lol.<br>  Don't tackle him today just wait a little while then when everything seems to be normal say I think we need to sit down and have a chat because you have not been happy for a while, that way you don't say either of you are wrong just that you are concerned that he is unhappy and you want to sort things out.<br>  Good luck|`|4POGapREaa	Just talk to him.  Tell him you feel like you're being picked on all the time & it's getting you so frustrated that you're snapping at him now too.  So unless he stops you're just going to be one of those couples that bitches nonstop at each other.  I'm sure he wouldn't want that.  Tell him if he wants to keep going you'll just point out every freaking flaw of his too.|`|KOXcw4klaa	he is looking for an argument.getting anal.why i don't know.im not there.but it could be a way to break up with you.to justify it.so he can be single again.or he is  control freak.either way it doesn't look good for you.|`|AA11138696	You are both letting the pressures of life get you down and you are snapping at each other.  It is easy to take things out on the ones we love but that is the way to destroy relationships.  You both need to step back and remember why you are together outside of the money troubles and other problems.  Try some counseling  you sound like you could both use it.|`|zy92ZFnMaa	my dad is the same way with my mum. he gets annoyed by living with her but loves her to bits! hes prob just feeling you in his space a bit. letting his stresses out on you. dont take his crap though!|`|PYIA2FCFaa	you just need to both sit down and talk things out. but wait until you are both clam then ask to talk. if he says no then he isn't ready yet. |`|ndVFMJbuaa	tell the lazy *insert word here* to do the washing up and tidying up himself, are you his maid or his wife? 
0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	This boys behaviour is the way it is because dad allows it. If he's like this at 13, how will be be towards you at 16? 18? This isn't good and dad has not provided this boy with the stability and consistency he needs. He feels unsafe (unsure of boundaries) and is constantly acting out his hostilities. He has more fun with his Mom who is probably worse. There is no quick fix for this, in fact, some might say that there is no going back and correcting these mistakes.<br>  <br>  A group home might benefit, but this late in the game it's not likely. He won't stop his acting out even if he is medicated, but he will start self medicating (drug use) soon if he hasn't already. If you are feeling overwhelmed with all of this, it's certainly understandable. Since dad doesn't seem to care (refuses medication for this boy) and he knows how it affects you, you are being sent some every clear non-verbal messages.<br>  <br>  If, or should I say, when it comes to your own stress level, you might have no choice but to end the relationship. This type of stress can adversely affect your health and you can't take this lightly for very much longer if I understand you correctly.<br>  <br>  Since dad isn't willing to stand up and take your side, I can't say that I have a positive feeling about a successful continuation of your relationship.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You should of thought about him possibly living with you before you got married. Did you Husband not tell you about his crazy son and ex wife? If he did then you already knew the possibility of problems arising. <br>  <br>  I suggest the boy either goes to counseling and gets on meds or else I would walk. Sounds like your Husband doesn't care about you very much if he is not willing to do this.|`|MRfqPKScaa	Tell him that he should go do drugs with his mom. If that's how he wants it fine. Make sure he knows how nice living in the streets is.|`|6oMpHXSiaa	Don't pay so much attention to him. If you have problems with his son you need to talk it over with your husband. I really know what your going threw cuss my girlfriends son is really conniving. About a week ago He was acting disrespectful and I got to the point where he couldn't be talking to me like how he did. He's only 14 and he was actually cussing at me in my own house on which I pay for and he lives under. He thinks it's alright to disobey me when he told me I'm not his father. His father is Neoware to be found and he hardly knows him. He just uses that excuse to react on the way he does. I just don't even let him get to me and I leave it all to his mother now. At that age they think they know it all. Whatever that's how I deal with it now. Don't let him get to you. He just a kid. Let him be hell learn.|`|XPPGphLbaa	What would your husband do if you did the 'tough love' thing?  <br>  Tell the boy to shut up and put up or he will be punished: grounded, no friends over, no going out, no phone calls.  He is still a minor and can be controlled.  It is vital that this be done NOW before he gets any older.<br>  <br>  Obviously he is very angry about his situation - he is in a lot of emotional pain and has no idea how to deal with it except to lash out.  The doc is partially right.  He needs meds to control his impulses - which could include violence toward you and/or your husband.  <br>  <br>  Your husband needs a rude awakening about his son's problems.  Perhaps you and the doc could do an "intervention"?  Any other family members around to help?  Iwish you the best of luck in dealing with this - it is quite serious.
F4k68ilkaa	You don't need to use the ring box, just put it in your pocket.<br>  <br>  Since the nights are getting warmer, take her for a beautiful walk in the moonlight by a pretty lake or park in your area. At a particularly nice spot, stop, and be sure to tell her how much you love her, and how you can't wait to spend your life with her. You can give her the ring then.<br>  <br>  Also, if you do it in a special spot like that, it can become 'your place' and every time she goes there in the future, she'll remember that night and what you said...|`|tpSSka4taa	Put it in your pocket and give it her....or buy another ring box from a jewelers and make sure its plain and put it in there.

(My husband did this for one of our anniversaries--on top of a piece of cheese cake), or if you're buying her flowers, take a little piece of ribbon and tie the ring to one of the flowers, or if it's a bouquet, tie a nice big bow around the bouquet and attach the ring to it.<br>  Good luck and best wishes on your anniversary!|`|lvOR401haa	This is something I think is very sweet myself.<br>  <br>  Why not get her a copy of her fave book and tie it to the marker ribbon.

VK8tU2MXaa	that happens.......<br>  i try hanging out with BOTH him and his gf, make friends with her, <br>  or try finding your own gf and you could on double dates<br>  but you gotta understand that people change and a best friend of 5 years can suddenly become more distant than a stranger (personal experience)<br>  a quote i read in i think it was chicken soup for the teenage soul<br>  the friends that stay with you for the life are the ones that have watched you change, and let you change, but still accept you|`|CvXIBihjaa	That just happened to me too. Unfortunately there isnt much to do. You can talk to him but he wont truly listen, or care anymore. He doesnt mean for it to hurt you but that fact remains that it does. The thing is, thats life. In 30 years when everyone is married, many people dont have bestfriends, just there significant other. Sucks. I know. But this seems to be your first experience with it. Surround yourself with other people. There are alot of benefits to that. :]<br>  <br>  Good luck :]|`|Qe0ycNmdaa	i know what you mean. im in a long-term relationship and so is my best friend. we never get to talk or hang out because of our relationships. i recommened doing all you can to talk to them. you dont want to ruin his relationship if he's happy.

I'm a girl and my best friend is always with her bf. Everytime i call her she can't talk. Also whenever i want to go out on the weekend she can but its with her bf. She invites me but i prefer not to go because she always acts different around him she's not herself! You should tell him how you feel. He probably doesn't know how it's making you feel!  Give it a go!  GOOD LUCK |`|hGYcuJRLaa	try to get him alone (i know, it might be kind of hard if shes always around...) and tell him exactly how you feel. don't make it sound like its his fault (i.e. don't say "youre hanging out with her too much!") say something like, "lately i feel like i haven't had time to talk to or hang out with you much because of your new gf. im happy for you, but i miss my best friend". then suggest having a guys-only night so you two have time to hang out and catch up without his gf there.|`|xF2rD507aa	My friend,i say you can not call him your best friend because friendships sacrifices from both sides.If he does this way,it means he does not worth your sacrifices and is not your best friend at all!|`|cGHyFOg1aa	Just go to his house and threaten your Guy's friendship. And he might snap like a twig. Or ask if he could balance it all out. It is very tough to have a friendship and a girlfriend.|`|C5ci3xHSaa	u need to just sit down and talk to him and maybe him and his girl just so she doesnt get jealous so she knows the situation as well.. he probably doesnt realize how u feel or anyting|`|xMA4sgboaa	be careful. because friends can ruin others' relationships if they interfere. talk to him about it. tell him that it's hurting u and ur his bud.|`|hxeyIaHbaa	wat Train said|`|HHjIjhbYaa	tahts tough, you could jus stop by his house one day and tell him that you gotta spend less time wit that girl cuz u think u had a good friendship and u dont want it to go away!|`|39T5FqpEaa	The idea of bros before hos is for Bros and Hos only.  In reality, people prefer love, (or some semblance of it) over friendship.  Although if you really intend to continue pursuing your friend, (which happened to me with an old friend, who I never speak to anymore and who has changed considerably), seriously attempt to be friends with the girlfriend.  If you start calling/texting her all the time, try getting her to hangout, usually your best friend will be like, "TOTALLY, let's go hang out!"  since he'll have his best friend and his girlfriend together.  Don't give up yet.  But if after a year you are literally never seeing him and don't get phone calls back within the month, I'd say move on.

KpxVsPZSaa	yes, you do wear it but on the right hand then put it on the left hand when the ceremony is finished or later that night.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I wore mine on my ring finger, then when it was time to exchange rings, I slipped it off, my husband put the wedding band on, then I put the engagement ring back on.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	sometimes.  a friend of mine had a wrap that her engagement ring fit into, and she didn't want to have to take off the engagement ring during the ceremony, put the wrap around it, and put it back on.  so right before the ceremony she gave her engagement ring to the best man who had the wedding bands, and so the groom put both her engagement ring and the wrap on her finger at once.|`|woOeYFrEaa	I wore mine on my wedding finger--I didn't want to confuse my husband about what finger to slip the wedding band on and he was used to seeing the engagement ring on it.  After we left the ceremony I just switched the rings so the wedding band was first.<br>  <br>  I don't think you'll find any official rules about how its supposed to be done.  Do whatever you find the easiest/most meaningful.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I had mine on until it was time for the wedding.  I then gave it to my maid of honor so the only ring my husband put on my finger was the wedding band.  After the wedding was over my MOH gave me my engagement ring back so as we greeted guests they could see my set together.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I am going to wear mine on my right hand during the ceremony, then I will move it back after the ceremony.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Some do, some don't.  I didn't wear mine, the best man kept it until after the ceremony.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	The main thing to remember is that the wedding band/ring stays closest to your heart.  So if you were to wear your engagement ring down the aisle, then take it off before you put your wedding ring on--then slip that engagement ring on after the wedding ring.  Simple.<br>  <br>  One complication I find on most brides is that the engagement ring doesn't want to come off at that particular time, then the brides would end up placing the wedding ring on the outside of her engagement ring.|`|a62a59bf15f22da92d36347e9dbcb088aa	I'm also going to wear mine on the right hand.  That way I won't fumble with it by accident when we get to the exchange of rings.  Whatever you choose, you should wind up with your wedding ring on first (closest to your heart), then your engagement ring.  Best wishes!|`|tpSSka4taa	Dont wear it on your wedding finger cos thats obviously where the wedding ring goes o during the ceremony. i wore mine on the same finger but on the right hand until the end of the day when i put it back onto the correct finger on top of my wedding ring.|`|jkXDhtsQaa	YES -- you wear the ring that he proposed to you down the isle.  That should be the pretty diamond ring.  Afterward, you can wear that on a daily basic or just have matching wedding bands to wear daily.|`|8zyu6FWpaa	I'm getting married in April and I plan to wear mine on my thumb, then slip it on my ring finger after the ceremony.  I don't know if that's considered proper, but it doesn't really matter.|`|xgLqw3WXaa	um yes. you wear it on your right hand and then they put your wedding band on your left hand and then u put your engagement ring back on above the wedding band.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Yes. I'm planning on wearing mine on my right ring finger and then slipping it over on top of my wedding band at the reception.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	yes on the right hand.|`|kNJBwpgNaa	Most people I know (including what I did) wear theirs during the ceremony. You can switch them around before the reception so your wedding band is at the back.

For one some girls tend to be too emotional and they laugh at everything which is wierd. I like to chill with the guys cuz you can always laugh at some stupid things they do, and be friends with them easily! Most of their humor is contagious and i love it!  Its true, girls cant function without a herd sometimes, thats why their called cliques, which, to me, are COMPLETELY pointless! Sure they like to hang out with each other, but seriously? ALL THE TIME?! its like u cant even talk to one girl without having the other ten girls behind her know. Just my opinion, hope i helped!|`|wNdB8Gjyaa	I like hanging out with people who like to debate philosophy and politics; and generally take a laid back approach to life. I dunno which gender is better that this.<br>  <br>  I spend a lot of time alone pretty much.<br>  <br>  But seriously, I usually have one close friend, and the pattern has been girls. It's not a preference, that's just how it's happened. Girls tolerate my cynicism and distaste for "appealing to the group" as you talked about. Guys seem a little more weirder out that I talk to girls for something other then sex, or that I don't mind talking about feelings.<br>  <br>  Maybe hanging out with girls is rubbing off on me, maybe I should get out before it's too late!|`|G3dLnTNTaa	I'm a girl, and I like to hang out with boys more than girls. Girls, I agree, are more dramatic and annoying. Boys are more fun and you can do other things with them besides painting toenails and watching the notebook over and over again, and talking about each other. However a girls night has its place in a girls world haha|`|6hJ5IM2Eaa	I like to hang out with boys! I am a girl. I think guys let loose and goof around a lot more then girls and that makes the hanging out part so much fun! I also think girls are mean witches when they can be. Guys also don't always talk about themselves ... and they make you feel totally comfortable and its an easy way to find a bf and/or gain best friends for life. Boys are cool!|`|YHm8jAtbaa	GUYS definitely girls cause way too much drama! o im a girl|`|vekEfGIGaa	I'm a guy and since November 2008, I've mainly been hanging out with just girls. I guess it's just cause there's a lot of girls on my course at university and that I'm the only boy in my studio(I'm studying for a Fine Art degree). Also, I've never had any sisters, so the all-girl-except-for-me social situations have really made up for that. Anyway, from my experiences I'd say girls can be a lot more sensible when they want to be and take me more seriously than a lot of my male friends. And I agree that socializing with large groups of the opposite gender is a good way of finding that one special person

Mine will be a slower, more traditional one and my fiance's mother loves Elvis so we figure we'll pick a quicker Elvis song to make it easy for them! My fiance's mom has a good sense of humour, so if my fiance hops on his lap and wheels them around a little, she'll probably laugh like crazy!<br>  <br>  Seeing as your dad has been like this for many years, he may have thought of this more than you have, and may have a solution.|`|crxbob5jaa	You can ask him if he wants to do something for the father/daughter dance. And what his suggestions are. If he doesn't want to, that is fine. <br>  <br>  Most weddings I've been at lately have only had the bride/groom first dance and that was it. The dance floor was opened to everyone after that so people didn't have to sit and watch a dance show while the people dancing felt awkward.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! actually what you could do is have him in his wheelchair and have someone behind him making circles once in a while.

xjazE0xmaa	There's two routes on this: reselling the ring to someone who might want to use it or reselling to a jewelry store/ pawn shop/ someone in the jewelry industry.  <br>  <br>  Route 2: To get the most money for your gold and diamond item, have the ring appraised (at least the diamond) and make certain the appraiser can give you the Rapaport value of the diamond.<br>  <br>  When you attempt to sell a diamond in good condition, the dealer is likely to make an initial offer of 60% of the diamond’s “Rap value,” according to the Rapaport Diamond Report.  The report is updated each week and covers diamonds of varying color, shapes, grades, and sizes up to six carats.  <br>  <br>  Often the dealer’s offer is far less than the diamond’s appraised value.  This is because the appraiser is aiming to tell you the diamond’s retail value.  If your diamond’s retail value is $10,000, the Rapaport value may be $4,000.  It may be $5,000.  You simply won’t know unless you see a relatively current Rapaport sheet listing the qualities of your particular diamond.  And the dealers know most people aren't familiar with Rapaport value, so they'll try to give you a lot less than the Rap value.  Show you are familiar with the industry, and they'll likely bump up the offer, though not to anything above Rap value.<br>  <br>  Hypothetically, let’s say your diamond that was appraised at $10,000 has a Rapaport value of $5,000.  That means the wholesale price of the diamond would be $5,000.  The average dealer would offer you 60% of the $5,000, so you should expect the dealer’s initial offer to be $3,000.  As you can see, it simply doesn’t matter to the dealer that your ring has been appraised at $10,000.  To the dealer, there is no reason to expect the diamond to sell for more than the Rapaport value.  <br>  <br>  However, there are plenty of reasons a diamond could sell for less than the Rapaport price.  A diamond could be chipped, have scratches, or otherwise show damage.  These things happen.  And dealers know it.  So, if a dealer offers much less than 60% of the Rapaport value on a ring you thought was in good condition, ask why and listen with a skeptic’s ears.  <br>  <br>  The dealer looks at the gold at its market value--unless it's a unique setting that could resell easily.  Market value for gold changes every few minutes.  Here's a good source: <a href="http://www.monex.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.monex.com/.</a>  <br>  <br>  All of this can be a hassle, and some people would rather go with "Route 1" as it is simpler.<br>  <br>  Route 1:<br>  Find out the specs of your diamond (from the paperwork that came with the jewelry or through an appraiser--or you can send it to a gemological laboratory, like GIA, for grading at about $100 for a 1-carat diamond).  Look up the retail value of similar diamonds on a diamond search engine, like <a href="http://www.diamondpriceguru.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.diamondpriceguru.com/.</a>  Then list your jewelry on eBay or Craig's List to see if you can get a price that makes you happy.  Posting a photo of the jewelry and a copy of the appraisal helps attract willing buyers.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	that would be a jewelry store, genius.|`|AA11441704	nice avatar........<br>  shop?|`|ACecbVghaa	Find out the price of gold for the day and find a local jeweler who's paying out. Also, have your ring appraised first to ensure you get what your diamond is worth.

a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	i think your sisters should make sacrifices for you because you are part of the family, ESPECIALLY if you have ever made sacrifices for them, which i am sure you have at some point or you wouldn't be so upset.  <br>  <br>  however, since they sound like they want nothing to do with you or your wedding, you should just go ahead and do everything the way you wanted to anyway.  you shouldn't let them ruin everything because you will end up regretting it later and resenting them for it.  there may be something else going on with your little sister, and eventually you will resolve the situation, hopefully before the wedding, but if not after, then you should just enjoy it as it is.  this only happens once, and you need to enjoy it.  even if no one shows up except your ringbearer and his mommy, at least you will have fun knowing you finally got to the point of marriage.  don't let your little sister ruin it for you.  <br>  <br>  and since it IS so far from now, your family situation may change between now and then.  you never know.|`|lvOR401haa	Wow - this sounds a little harsh from your sisters, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  They're happy to come party, but not witness the reason for celebration?!!!<br>  <br>  I'd either call them or write to them and explain how you feel, and that this is not only important to you, but your sick Mum.  If they cannot make the effort to come to the ceremony, I'd not bother with them to 'party' either. <br>  <br>  It's just rude - especially if they don't have real reasons.|`|ACecbVghaa	Why would you want sisters like THAT to be there?! They obviosuly don't care about sharing the moment, it's their loss, not yours. I would enjoy the day and be greatful to those who came, not worry about those who didn't. I would also have a sit-down heart-to-heart with your sisters, tell themhow you feel and clear the air. If they are really as heartless as they seem, you may be better off without them!|`|fNAU0OL6aa	that is awful!!! my sister and brother can't come to my wedding and i'm very upset over it, but what you just described is not right. They need to be there for you, even if it means postponing a vacation so they can take time off work. That is not a good excuse.|`|4fe7aff6fc9d1806e4060e8d88d58d4aaa	It'd be great if all your family could be there, but in this case you really have no control over what they do.  Instead of focusing on the people who aren't going to come and who are causing you stress,  just put it aside. <br>  <br>  Focus on the joy of the occassion and the people who are going out of their way to share the day with you.   It can be hard to do when you are being hurt by family members, but just try really hard and put it to rest.  Enjoy those that are there and don't even think twice about those who choose to not be at the ceremony.|`|iDfRTLklaa	Tell them to stop being so childish, and that you expect them to be there to support you.  And that if they can make it to the reception, you expect them to be there for the ceremony as well.|`|884v4VhGaa	I'd be plenty ticked if a family member just decided to not come to the wedding. Especially since they expect to come to the reception. <br>  <br>  Your older sister does have an excuse, although she should talk to her supervisor and see if she can get some unpaid time off (assuming she can afford it) to go to the wedding, a lot of jobs that sort of thing can be done. If, however, going to your wedding would mean that she loses her job, then try to look at her coming to the reception as being a case of half a loaf being better than none. <br>  <br>  Your little sister, however, doesn't seem to have any such excuse. Ask her flat-out why she doesn't want to come to the wedding. I know extremely anti-religion people who made an exception for weddings in the immediate family. For a sister you swallow your opinions and go.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	it's a shame but they obviously weren't raised right.  have your mother talk to them, or some other family member they will listen to.  tell them how gauche and disrespectful it is that they can't spend 30 mins or however long your ceremony is, celebrating your life commitment with you.  every damn day people have to do things they don't want to do, it's part of life.  yeah I would rather not have attended all the 90 min catholic mass weddings that I've gone to over the years but I did it anyway because I was happy for my friends.|`|AA11603468	That's just so sad.

But, my advice, ask her out, and see if she accepts. You can tell with nonverbal ques if she has an interest in you. Eyes shifting downward and coyly, touch of your hand, and she pulls away. If she avoids touching you and talks to you in a very straight matter of fact way, she might not be interested.|`|DqLA8uGEaa	well don't be afraid! act more um what is the word...sure of your self maybe you can send her more flowers or just find out what things she likes to do and take one full weekend and do all her stuff even if you don't like to or take her to her fav restaurant ( even if it a fast food joint) and then tell her how you really feel but don't act so shy about it that is such a turn off or OK this is the best way if your not sure and you are to shy then just one day if she is around call a Friends and just say sum ting like oh i am with my gf and she how she reacts or maybe and if she acts all wearied say sorry it just slipped if she says nothing and smiles then there ya go you got your answers but after knowing her for a year don't you know he well enough yet? to know if she likes you or get her something kinda personal from you like a teddy bear or a pic or something or get her something she really really wants and tell her you would give anything in the world for her jsut to see her smile and u want to show her that so ask for a chance to rock her world|`|mKMcaGkCaa	tell her, but don't be beggin or overly adoring.  tell it like it is..|`|p6eJEgAGaa	I want tyou to keep up with the sweet stuff do some  thing like go to kiss her in the rain and lay under the stars watching the shuting stars! thats what i love and just to call at night to say good night!|`|qewOZjQqaa	You're in the same situation my boyfriend and I were in.

juRWvc0eaa	Sorry, I want a little more out of marriage than just a check. I want it all.... A woman that is 100% there for me in EVERY way, and someone who could accept my kids as well. If you aren't willing to build a life and grow old with me, it just isn't gonna happen. Good luck finding some poor bastard though.|`|tG6Lju7Raa	Me thinks you are barking up wrong tree little one.|`|jy2ss6rWaa	How much money?

If someone marries you can't you just divorce them and claim half of their stuff?
juRWvc0eaa	Dude, lemme tell you honestly. That sudden drop off is a clear warning sign of cheating. I'm not saying she is, but I have dealt with that first hand, and it does happen. They feel too guilty to face you, so they avoid you because they don't have the heart/courage to tell you to your face.<br>  Watch out for her saying that she just needs her space, and that she isn't ready for commitment. If that is a complete change from what she said before, you may want to ask her bluntly what is REALLY going on. If you want more signs she is cheating, yahoo "warning signs of cheating girlfriends." Make a check list, and see how many she does. When I caught my Ex, she had done 7 outta 9 on one of the lists I found. Couldn't figure out how I knew she was cheating.<br>  Here's hoping I'm wrong, but there is nothing wrong with being prepared for the worst.|`|cnGYE7keaa	how old are you? she either is over you or you did something to piss her off. ask one of her friends to find out for you

vmwHnAWAaa	Cara, desencana, chifre é uma coisa que botam na cabe?a das pessoas, isso só acontece com outros que a namorada ainda tem "amizade" com os EX, n?o com você...rs.<br>  <br>  Estou brincando cara, tipo, acho que a maioria aqui n?o vai saber pois só você conhece sua namorada o suficiente para tomar uma decis?o (ou n?o), se vocês se gostam e a rela??o está funcionando, tudo bem, desde que haja sinceridade por parte dos dois. N?o liga pro pessoal aqui n?o, você é que está vivenciando a situa??o, eu particularmente acho que manter contato no sentido de ser simpática com um ou outro ex ainda vai, mas manter amizade com vários deles a ponto de ligar e até se encontrar com eles é muito estranho, eu particularmente pulava fora mas isso é opini?o minha.|`|0LF0k7Kpaa	depende do casal envolvido|`|539270258a2b099d679d0208b6b2f0aeaa	hahahah   q engra?ado! <br>  <br>  Eu acho normal ter amizado com ex...

Mas olha, num namoro sério, vcs tem q confiar um no outro...  se ela te diz q s?o somente amigos, confie nela ué! Vai fazer o q? Se vc ficar prendendo ela, colocando restri?oes, proibindo ela de fazer as coisas q ela quer e com quem ela quiser, esse namoro nao vai dar certo de jeito nenhum...<br>  <br>  No final vc até pode virar corno, mas nao vai ser esses "corretivos" q v?o evitar q vc seja corno...|`|d8I6iP2Eaa	Amigo, você n?o deve desistir.

Isso é bem comum aqui no YR! e me faz pensar em como é difícil encontrar alguém legal, desencanado e seguro o suficiente para manter uma rela??o séria e madura, sem esse lance de achar que o outro tá me fazendo de boba, me traindo toda hora. Se for para ter um relacionamento assim, prefiro ficar sozinha.<br>  <br>  Eu acho que a maioria das pessoas é insegura de fato. Se você n?o é assim, ponto para você e para sua namorada, se vocês conseguem viver dando liberdade individual um para o outro. Quem sabe lidar com o que tem e faz o possível para viver da melhor forma como um casal desencanado n?o tem com o que se preocupar. Até mesmo porque é ilus?o das pessoas achar que podem controlar alguém, eu já tive uma rela??o com mais liberdade e outra rela??o com rédea curta (em mim) e já digo para vocês que na segunda eu acabei traindo a pessoa de uma maneira muito intensa... Ent?o acho que n?o tem nada a ver os namorados ficarem se controlando porque isso só estraga a rela??o. Se for para trair, vai acontecer de qualquer jeito, sendo inseguro/controlador ou n?o.<br>  <br>  As pessoas est?o sempre vendo problema em tudo e isso é totalmente desnecessário. Quando alguém me fala que eu tenho que ficar de olho aberto eu nem presto aten??o porque odeio paranóia. Apesar de já ter traído, eu já usei muito da liberdade em outras rela??es (longas) e n?o fiz nada de errado, amei muito o meu parceiro e fui fiel até em nível de pensamento, só mantendo meu pensamento nele.<br>  <br>  Muitas vezes os conselhos do YR! ajudam muito, porém nem sempre s?o confiáveis. Há muitos homens e mulheres imaturos dando respostas absurdas que n?o se enquadram em relacionamentos entre pessoas sérias, envolvendo sentimentos verdadeiros. Ou ent?o acontece muito de pessoas frustradas usarem suas experiências ruins de namoro para aconselhar uma pessoa como eu, que só me envolvi com pessoas que me respeitaram muito e com as quais hoje tenho uma boa amizade (ex-namorados). Eu n?o costumo lidar com pessoas infantis, eu nem atraio esse tipo de gente.<br>  <br>  Acredito que você tem que descobrir com quem está lidando (a sua namorada) e buscar compreender através de pessoas como ela, quais os valores dela e como ela se comporta nos relacionamentos. Entenda o que ela quer e o que ela espera do relacionamento de vocês. Isso é essencial.<br>  <br>  Amigo, na verdade eu n?o sei se respondi a sua pergunta, mas espero que meu próprio desabafo te ajude a compreender melhor a situa??o. Um abra?o, boa sorte.|`|EB0SK4OTaa	Sei lá, entende!!!

But the average height for women is anywhere from 5'4 to 5'6, and most men date women within that height range.|`|d5zEYomEaa	You ask what height clothes look best in. Well, it also depends on weight. Someone who is very tall and thin will look one way, someone who is short and curvy might look sexier with her curves, as might a tall curvy woman, and an overweight person will look another, all depending on someone's taste and preferences such as I think  women 4'10" - 5'4" look very cute and sexy in clothes as long as they have a nice shape and the clothes are the right size. <br>  <br>  A mini skirt will look good on any height as long as they have nice shapely legs, a tank top might look unattractive on someone with very thick flabby arms, but a nice smile can make a woman look good at any height. Madona, Eva Longoria and Dolly Parton are all about 5'1" and I think look sexier than Nicole Kidman who is almost 6 feet tall but has no shape, butt or boobs or hips to fill out her clothes, just a stick figure.|`|2e6b63593deee4333c524ac68cf22a52aa	Any height can look good, but average heights are probably the easiest to pull off.  Average is probably between 5'3 -5'6.  5'6 - 5'7 isn't really that tall, and most girls look great at that height.  It's a bit taller than average, but not truly "tall" for a woman.|`|1CywfyhXaa	5'2"...because that's my height|`|HcTem7dVaa	5'7"|`|QoDLaQiraa	Well I would have to say that hight has alot to do with perosnality and how they dress. I think a tall girl is better at being sexy, because physically she is more comparable in size and therefore a bit intimidating which adds to the sexness. A girl with long legs that can look me right in the eyes with confidence is sexy.<br>  <br>  On the other hand I find short petite girls adorable. I love that I can just pick them up and feel all manly. Lol yes it's funny but true. I guess it makes guys feel a bit more like a protector. <br>  <br>  Thats my spin on it everyones will vary.|`|8Okc4Sfuaa	tall and goreous like me. JK <br>  but anyway i think tall. b'cuz i'm 5'10|`|e65002231bc65bccfb3ec3f096ce3173aa	Any height.

Ou algum afrancesado (que n?o conhe?o) mas deve se pronunciar, carped?, coisa assim. Perfume só se dá se Vc. tiver absoluta certeza que a pessoa goste da fragrancia. O nome é latino e significa "aproveite o dia". N?o me lembro do cheiro mas o nome é bem sugestivo. Tomara que ela goste e aproveitem o namoro. Mas sempre muito cuidado ao presentear com perfumes tá? Só na certeza. Sucesso!!|`|0fa382d05aff64bdc3d51ba5ccd44e6faa	se o cheiro for bom ela irá gostar sim|`|Pk8Q7OG0aa	Amigo assista mais aquele quadro de etiqueta do fantástico, ontem mesmo foi falado nisso, presentes de natal , e falaram algo que eu na verdade sempre soube, perfumes é algo muito pessoal, pois o seu olfato pode apreciar um determinado odor que para o dela  pode nao ser muito agradavel

Get him some help.|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	Men have massive libidos. It's nothing against you, you shouldn't feel upset about it. He could either be looking at porn or cheating on you (if he really has two balls and a penis, he really HAS to pick one of those two), and clearly he's picking the more respectable of the two. If you were a guy you'd understand. Don't be upset about it. If you dump him and look for a guy who isn't like this, I guarantee you'll remain single for the rest of your life.|`|aF1tqNdXaa	Dont panic, guys like porn. Why dont you watch it with him, or play with him while he watches it. Better still why dont you make some for/with him
ugWaptu2aa	There is no doubt that he has feelings for you. However, he is overseas and it seems obvious to me that he is seeing other women. Men do this when they are lonely and sometimes physical intimacy overpowers us. Since you are not married to the guy, I recommend giving him this freedom. Not for his benefit, but for yours. If you suspect that he is cheating, it will drive you mad. Why waste so much energy on a boy that is probably keeping you as the girl back home while he’s chasing foreign tail? Let him go, and when he returns assess your relationship. He’s not the only guy who will see you for your looks and your personality. You are the one in control of your love life, not him.|`|wmOgseCgaa	He may have feelings for you but is unsure how you feel about him.

62e4f9f407e182988e4f916152cd38fbaa	First I read the other answers and based mind from what they said. (Not to repeat or copy) They have plenty of got input, but here's my analysis.<br>  <br>  This doesn't really sound like harrashment, it just sounds like he rolled the dice a few too many times. <br>  <br>  You're attractive to him, and him sitting next to you but not saying anything or "noticing" you is him trying to sneak a peak at his candy a.k.a you or him just trying to get you to notice him which has worked. <br>  <br>  He probably finally got the nerve to ask you out or he got tired of playing around and when you finally said yes he was okay with it but as the clock ticked down he paniced and bailed, maybe your too hot for him he thinks or he'll just embaress himself more than if he just called it off. <br>  <br>  We've all had that one time when we were complete idiots or dorks got comfortable with someone then the situation changes and we fumble.<br>  <br>  I remember I finally got to get this girl to give me her phone number and we got to a ready swing of talking occasionally unless one night a guy picked up her phone and I totally freaked and pretended that I was calling for pizza, it didn't pass and I was a complete loser that night (also didn't win the poker game that night -_-)<br>  <br>  All I'm saying is sometimes we choke when things happen a little out of plan. Talk things over with him and start things off from scratch, maybe not a full blown date next time you guys want to meet, but just a walk or a coffee or something. <br>  <br>  Some people don't need to talk to each other to tell the other they're in love. I don't think you guys are there yet (if you even want to be) but to break the awkward silence there always t.v. You guys could talk about the office (Jim & Pam is a classic example of weird office relationship) the more you guys can talk the easier working together is going to be, then you guys can be better friend, and eventually friends with benefit...or true love...whichever comes first.<br>  <br>  Hoped this helped, and goodluck|`|ugWaptu2aa	This sounds like work place harrassment. I recommend that you speak with your Human Resources department. If you don't stop it now, it will get far worse.|`|wmOgseCgaa	talk to your supervisor....he sounds creepy.

Foi um longo precurso até eu juntar os dois...E se ela n?o quisesse nada com ele, pelo menos ele n?o ficaria sem gra?a perto dela, que é o que acontece com muitas pessoas quando elas levam um fora<br>  o importante é que deu certo no final..mas, voltando ao seu caso, o importante é ser sincero com ela, pois, como já disse aqui outras vezes, o amor só tem a acrescentar<br>  abra?o|`|mmug4HlGaa	antes da fala com ela<br>  vc tem que observar<br>  se ela vai corresponder essa paix?o<br>  <br>  se ela ? corresponde...<br>  nem fala nada, se ? vc vai perde a amizade<br>  <br>  boa sorte|`|u4tFAWHGaa	Você deve ser direto, diga pra ela o que você sente e ela com certeza te dará uma resposta, boa sorte.

It's such an sweet idea! As far as messaging her, just message her and say "let's hang out this weekend, i have a surprise for you!" <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|EGU2MHSPaa	Ask her out in person, at least ask her, otherwise you missed the chance.  But at least get the question out there.  Girls don't really forget when a guy tells them they like them.|`|Cy3XsA8aaa	she obviously likes you too. ask her out at weekend, she's not going to turn you down.|`|PBntnqepaa	No need to message her as if to prepare her for your asking...when you ask, just say something like, would you like to hang out sometime, or go get coffee or something? it doesn't seem so official which can take the edge off and doesn't seem like DATE NIGHT which can be daunting in itself...if you keep it low key like getting coffee or something then you can just meet up, chat and go from there into dinner and a movie or a concert or whatever...keep it light for the first one...and then you will know what she is thinking about her level of interest...and can be comfortable too. <br>  <br>  To hang out somewhere and talk is much easier than orchestrating a huge date for the first meeting and for both a lot less intimidating. Listen to your intuition...and just ask her..it is better to know than to wonder for the rest of your life. <br>  <br>  And if she says yes, cool...if not, maybe she isn't the one meant to be in your life right now...I wish you the best! Sometimes it is the risks that we take that bring us the best memories....<br>  <br>  I went to prom (back in the day) with my friends college RA..we went to visit her when I was a senior and he said, hey when you get in town call me up and we can go out...so I took the plunge and wrote to him asking him to take me to my prom...I figured the worst thing he could say was no....but he ended up driving 2 hours to my town and being my date and what a memory it was that I remember fondly...we didn't hook up for the long term once I got up there, but I really took a risk and it paid off. <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your happiness!

He may not want to lose you, but he also wants to continue to be able to do whatever he wants. You probably love him, but you need to let him go. You are doing too much work for him to sit down and lay on his **** all day chatting up, looking at porn, and probably getting off too. As for him, I suggest he visits a psychiatrist or psychologist because at least he is recognizing his mental problems.|`|QQv2K8woaa	Ummm, yeah I would say it is inappropriate.  He doesn't work and cant even help around the house that you pay for or do something that you ask him to do?  That is completely ridiculous and I would tell him its gonna be my way or the highway.  If he doesn't get his a$$ up and moving and helping out, send him on his way.|`|6L6i2fzGaa	Why are you with him?<br>  <br>  He really has no incentive to do anything at this point because you let him do whatever he wants. He doesn't work, he doesn't pay rent, he doesn't clean up, he watches porn all day. Why would he want that to change when there are no repercussions for his behavior?<br>  <br>  He isn't respectful of you at all. He needs to shape up or ship out.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend is truly that a BOYfriend. He needs to become a man and stop being so selfish.

Since they aren't into giving up clues, you can't make any sort of inference as to who they are.  <br>  <br>  I will bet that when this person does speak, people listen.  I will also guess that when they do speak, it is to give out some really good information....if not, then this person is a social reject.|`|pBVjKCJ1aa	The person is usually excessively shy with low self-esteem and very little self-confidence.<br>  Actually, someone like you who notices people like this can do a great amount to help such a person by helping them by being friendly, kind and gentle and complimenting them on their achievements.<br>  Do it without fanfare and without people around because people like this don't like to be drawn into the public eye.

What is freaky is someone drove by and called your wife a whore. Seriously something wrong with this. I don't want your wife getting hurt what if the person drives by next time and throws something at her or even worse. You never know when it comes to a nut case what they might do. Go rent security cameras believe it or not they do not cost much set them up around your home. Sounds by what this person is saying on these cards this person is watching you. Also what you could do is get a few of your male friends together and set the stalker up. Make a sign throw some ballones on it and stick it out in front of your house put something on it like Jays B-day part this Sat or whatever and give a time. Then invite some close people over and everyone stay inside. In the meantime have some of your friends outside somewhere watching your home from a distance and if they see anything weird where someone keeps driving by or on foot what ever have your friends get as much info as they can on that person. A plate number anything even a picture if they can. <br>  All the police well do is make a random drive by your house so often. With out any leads and no suspect of the person who is doing this they don't have much to go on.

It makes your mom a crazy lady. She's probably jealous of the fact that you're growing up and getting into dating and she can't control you anymore when it comes to boys and kissing. My mom was the same way. Eventually she got over it but until then it was tough. I honestly don't have any good advice because she's your mom and I don't know her but try talking to her like an adult and without yelling or crying. Maybe if she sees that you can handle yourself and aren't having sex and all she'll be a little more ready to accept it. Also maybe introduce your bf to her if that's at all possible.|`|VER03tT2aa	that doesnt make you a **** i mean hes your boyfriend its not like hes just some random guy just ignore anyone who tells you that and eventually it will stop|`|tqVvE458aa	So she called you a ****?<br>  <br>  Wow shows how mature your mom is.. no offense.<br>  <br>  What kind of mother calls their daughter a ****.|`|Rn9QBroQaa	No, you're not a **** ... but your English is horrific.

uO0Lxk3Qaa	Be smart about it. Parents are the only people in this world that really care for us unconditionally so show them the respect that they deserve. Show them that you understand why they set such rules - that is to protect their son from harms. If you agree to a curfew then you should be a man of your words and be home on time. That's how I see it. No need to get into a conflict with the two most precious people in your life. <br>  <br>  Remember, be real with your parents, and they will be real with you. Show them that you are responsible enough to date and be allowed to go to late night parties.<br>  <br>  Trust should be earned.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rF9yHAHZaa	Well... Heres the thing, <br>  You told your Dad that you'de be in at 11. And you werent.<br>  Part of living with your parents is following their rules and respecting them. Its probably difficult for you to understand this concept, as respect isn't a thing many parents effectively teach their children. In highschool, you just 'don't care' what your parents say or think. You just want to do what you want to do. And they're right "thats the way it goes".<br>  <br>  You could have just called your friend.<br>  Blood is thicker than water, my friend|`|lM8UvYWeaa	well buddy <br>  you have two good choices you can rebel<br>  or you can take this in act mature about  it and your parents will problably let you off the hook earlier <br>  with parents you can either rebel and battle or play their game and earn their compolete trust|`|5LrqbEHyaa	How old are you?|`|DxZaYoWaaa	wow, your parents are such big cunts...<br>  <br>  i feel sorry for you|`|ifHH5L1Paa	How old r u?|`|ZVPRhBj2aa	Half an hour late is nothing, I don't know why your parents do that.<br>  But I can also see their point of view, I would be worried about my child.<br>  <br>  I suggest you sit down with them, have a talk, and explain to them that they are a little bit strict on you.<br>  But, before you do that, look at yourself in the mirror and try to see if you've done anything in the past to disobey them. If you have done something wrong, try to fix your behavior by doing things around the home, getting better grades, etc.<br>  <br>  Try opening the conversation by saying something like "So, mom, dad, about the other night. I know I came back a little late after the party, but I feel that you've been a little strict on me lately..." and continue the conversation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vV1a17Goaa	Deliberate with your parents on the matter, teens like you should get out more as it is a great way to stay active.Parents are like that, they are protective of their children but you would have to take a stand as this cannot be too excessive.<br>  <br>  Perhaps if your parents are still defiant, you can sign up for extracurricular activities that take place after school; your parents can understand that.If any circumstances are keeping you from conforming, you should find another way out of it without getting hurt on either side. For instance, you could have called your friend on his cellphone; you would have to go home early first of course.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped  ^   ^|`|Evz9vUTAaa	Dude, all your parents want to know is that you are going to be responsible.  Its all about the " he's responsible" bank account.   The more you put into it, the more you can take out later.  <br>  <br>  The harder you work on chores, the harder you work on grades, the harder you try to be nice to siblings,  the more you show your capability to be responsible to your parents  The more you help around the house, the more you make the effort to do what your parents ask, the more you can bargain with.  <br>  <br>  They want to know that you are becoming responsible.  If you are showing them very clearly and explicitly that you know how to be responsible, they will be more flexible with things like parties and friends.  <br>  <br>  You can always just try to rebel and sneak out all the time but that won't really solve the problem, right?  Just prove your ability to be responsible.  The tough thing is that it will take a while to build up that responsibility bank account, but once its built up you will have a lot of flexibility in your fun life.  Count on it.<br>  <br>  Side note: One suggestion-Talk to them.  I know this sounds awkward, but your parents sound very methodical.  Simply ask them what you can do to prove to them that you are trustworthy enough to be allowed to come home a little later, or to spend time with friends.  Parents sometimes see this as responsible.  Again, I know this sounds crazy, but give it a whorl.  Good luck.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You obviously know the rules, you made a decision, now live with the consequenses. The reason you were late was not the problem, it was not calling and asking to extend the time for this particular reason. The less you fight this this time, the more you show remorse and understanding how wrong you were, the better the future will be the next time you want to go out. Its give and take. All we ask is a call to give us a chance to maybe say yes, and be closer to you kids ok!! Sorry.|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Next time, be home on time.  You could have taken your friend to your house to talk and then you would have been on time and able to help your friend.<br>  <br>  You made your choice, now you have to accept the consequences.|`|CKKisY5Aaa	The best thing I think you could do is objectively inform your parents that you disagree with how they handled the situation and state why. Don't make it or let i become a shouting contest, just state your position. This will do a few things. A) Obviously it will stake out your claim on the circumstances, B) if you stay objective it will show your parents that you are thinking more like an adult and C) Maybe just maybe it will garner you a little respect from them.|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	simple: you told your "rents" you'd be home by 11 and you came home later than 11<br>  of course they punish you regardless of the reason<br>  doesnt sound too strict to me, my parents dont even let me party all that much|`|wvyMepZiaa	My parents used to be the same! Start doing horrible stuff, then coming home late wont seem like a big deal. My life is better now because my parents have lower expectations for me!

Just Kidding you may want to see a counselor with you, your girlfriend and the parents to see what would be the best idea.|`|EDu5NGh4aa	If you intend on eventually marrying her, then it's no problem.

If they knew you two were dating, then they shouldn't have really done that to you guys. It's a very tricky situation though.<br>  <br>  Legally, it's not illegal, because you aren't at all biologically related. However, people might just consider it a tiny bit weird, hence you'd have to explain this whole thing to everyone who raises an eyebrow at your situation.<br>  <br>  But it's not at all a reason to leave your girlfriend, especially if she's pregnant. The triplets thing is so incredibly cool, but she'll desperately need your support for them.|`|QoOx93PPaa	Well, really; if she's already pregnant there's not much for you to do. You've been dating for three years, you started out not being siblings, and in actuality you aren't even siblings now. If you were both from the same parents, that'd be bad; that'd be incest. However, that's not the case. But it's not like you could end the relationship now.|`|GOgs5YYVaa	stay with her<br>  DO not dump her<br>  yes it is a tad weir because she is now your sister<br>  but who cares<br>  the big question<br>  DO YOU LOVE HER?<br>  cause it seems like either your worried because she is your sister and you still wanna be with her<br>  OR<br>  you dont love her, and you don want to have kids with her, and now ur stuck with her coz she is also ur sis<br>  <br>  if you dont love her then im not tellin u what to do<br>  if you do or think u will <br>  then stay with her<br>  and tell her youll be there for her:)<br>  you see like a decent enough guy<br>  you have your parents to help out with ur kids aswell<br>  so you have plenty of help there<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  btw they ARE your kids yeh<br>  ?|`|LETO1MqVaa	haha well i guess there is nothing you can do, its hardly your fault your parents got married, its just a little odd, i assume you dont both live with your parents anymore so it shouldnt affect you to much, <br>  congratz on the triplets|`|mlTEsC3taa	Well she isnt your real sister so it should be fine stay together and it wont make seeing both your parents at once very hard|`|ysfRJLvLaa	it shouldnt make any difference your not biologically related!!<br>  <br>  congrats on the triplets|`|jN4qxK8Naa	Being a parent comes first forget about everything else|`|eRjouKS8aa	ya get ta live together now... lol.. should be ok ur not related.. also if u haven't changed ur last name then u's will have different last names...|`|AA11662925	Man this is complicated!

Otherwise, you will make him think he can't trust you in the future.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RF07iThiaa	I would say if you ever become part of these children's lives than be the best step-mother you can be and in the mien time you and you're husband should try and conceive, I know I feel that way, My husband has a child from a previous marriage and I feel he only got me pregnant because I wanted a kid and now he don't take care of our son so have a baby with him but make sure he wants the baby too.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I would be ticked off if my Husband didn't tell me about previous relationships and expecially children. You poor thing. All the feelings you are having are justified. i am not sure how you can move forward after he lied to you like that. This is not just some little white lie that isn't a big deal. This is a huge deal. Counseling would be in order. He needs a swift kick in the butt. I am not sure I could stay with a man like this.|`|XPPGphLbaa	As long as he is not paying child support, you have no need to think about the other kids - he must not have visitation either if you are just now finding out about them. <br>   If the children are with their mother, has she remarried?  If so, then they have a new father.  No worries for you there, either<br>  <br>  Do as he has done: move on and live your life with him.  Do not mess up by screwing with the past: his or yours.
A1rfDaANaa	have a party at the beach or pool or go some where fun
DcrI9zmkaa	She sounds shy.  Get to know her better in real life.  Talk to her at school and such.  Then, invite her out somewhere...coffee, the library, a school ball game, or whatever. :)|`|vwoqIUR6aa	she could be shy. does she initiate talking to you on facebook all the time?? if she does, she could like you and is shy talking to you in person.|`|EBkW1ME4aa	lol the first answerer, the fu**ck? lol anyways. I know its hard to ask, its hard for me to ask too, and my best advice and what you'd most likely do, just wait to find out more, or better yet, ask one of her friends what she thinks about you.|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	Take a stab at it worse thing that happens she says no and either you guys can still be friends or not either way you will know.|`|Lg4LfxZyaa	umm those are some false moves shes making,<br>  shes either really shy in person OR shes leading you on for her own entertainment...|`|WqZYpMwnaa	Umm|`|AA11376151	she's probably just shy or she thinks you should talk first <br>  ask her out!|`|Z0PqY7soaa	oh my gosh, this girl is acting the same way that i usually act around this guy i like. she probably secretly really likes you, but she is too afraid to approach you and just start a conversation even though you guys talk online. it seems that she likes it better when you come up to her and start the convo; she's probly afraid of rejection. keep talking and getting to know her better! ask for her number, if she gives you it and texts/calls you regularly, you know for sure that she likes you<br>  :)|`|37bf18725f6119df0b9fb3aca9f9baa2aa	It seems like she likes you - moderately, at the very least, otherwise she wouldn't be flirting with you at all - on facebook or elsewhere.  A guy is supposed to be the one who approaches first.  Do that.|`|cOqAU04yaa	The best thing you can do is ask her as soon as possible.  Don't worry about losing the friendship.  Don't end up in the friend zone.|`|LQRHDDYXaa	it sounds like she's interested, just a little shy.  keep starting conversations with her and flirt with her on and offline, soon she'll start being brave enough to talk to you first.|`|LrAd0OQZaa	shes shy man keep talking she likes you shes warm up to you just be consistent high five her or something girls like corney once in a while just not all the time<br>  cheers|`|B9F4hmjlaa	im guessing your young..<br>  dude shes just scared to talk in person because shes nervous. shes not when shes behind the computer screen. just give her time, she will open up|`|DwiQ66qyaa	go for it...i'm in the same situation and i really want the guy to ask me|`|RwuPrAW3aa	I think she is shy...n my kind of girl...that's how I was, the guy that I liked, I wont talk to him n I would try to show him that I am not interested in him n I dont care, but when he would email me or something, I used to do the same way this girl does...looks like she is interested in u, but take it slowly, start hanging out with her more n then ask her out...good luck...|`|6hJ5IM2Eaa	Its the way you approach it. Ask like this or something like it.You: " I don't want to ruin the great friendship we have but I just wanted to know if you liked me as a friend or more?'. If she looks offended or says no. Tell her you were just wondering about it but you don't want to ruin anything by asking her!|`|mLjaN1Z7aa	i agree with that, she's shy to talk to you personally , and if she's not interested with you, she will not flirt with you on facebook. why not try to invite her out, or coffee, try to talk with her regularly.|`|65jyxyz4aa	just keep flirting with her back. she'll come around and keep making convos and she'll begin to start them to.
3wWpKexoaa	You can't have a real relationship with someone who doesn't want to spend time with you.<br>  <br>  Even if he is very shy, you have to get to know each other before you can really be bf and gf.<br>  <br>  Tell him to meet you at school, have lunch together ~ don't push the bf / gf thing, just get to know each other as friends and see if you still like each other (you might not)!<br>  <br>  <br>  If you do, then it will make texting even more fun, if you don't, at least you have a new friend.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't turn up, stop answering his texts, he's too immature to be a real life bf.<br>  <br>  Cheers :-)|`|JV0i77uiaa	Just ignore him, and don't answer his tex.

884v4VhGaa	There is a way to overcome the addiction- my fiance struggled with the same problems, and has been clean for over a year now. However, it requires that he be dedicated to doing it. If you aren't willing to put up with it (and I don't blame you), then explain that to him. If he's unwilling to try to stop, then you're going to have to decide what your priorities are. Look at the answers you're getting here - he might very well believe that there's nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  If he is willing to stop, then be supportive. Yes, he will backslide occasionally. As long as he's trying it's good. Make sure that he knows that it hurts you, and remember that you're allowed to be hurt. But don't turn it into a you-vs-him fight, because there's no way for either of you to win that. <br>  <br>  Either way, I would actually suggest some extra couples counselling, in addition to the standard premarital counselling. And the standard advice holds - if he won't go with you, go alone. <br>  <br>  Send me a message if you have any more specific questions.|`|da9867c36a597c0300f015c02ac5ce02aa	Um, I would have to say you should not worry too much. My husband has a fascination with porn too. But I do not feel it is a problem. Because in all honesty would you rather he be watching porn, or would you rather he be confiding in other women? That is the way I look at it anyway. As for the children, as long as he is not looking at in the same room and as long as you have like separate computers or sign in passwords they should not be able to access it.|`|ACecbVghaa	If you are seriously concerned you should have him see a therapist. You can go together for a few sessions since it bothers you and he can see someone about the addiction/issues arising therefrom. There are plenty of human sexuality specialists who could either target the source or help reduce the behaviour.|`|PbCeuT36aa	There is nothing wrong with watching porn.<br>  You are the problem.<br>  If you won't accept him for who he is, then he's not the one for you.<br>  It's not like he's doing crack or molesting kids.|`|D4I1hmRPaa	First of all, porn is a problem. It's not a healthy addiction/habit by any means. Do a little research on it and what it leads to and it's not pretty. I'm not saying your fiance is going to molest your kids or become a serial killer or anything like that but porn does affect his way of thinking, how he views woman, and how he views the sacred act of sex with you. <br>  <br>  I can't tell you that things will be ok because I don't know that but I do know that it's bothering you, clearly or else you wouldn't have posed the question on here. Don't let this go. Talk to a professional about this issue, Have him talk to someone as well, of course only if he's willing, which when it comes to you, he should be willing to do anything. You are smart for thinking about the future affects this might have.. kudos for you on that. <br>  <br>  Pray about it, follow your heart and never settle for something less than the best.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I seriously think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here. <br>  <br>  Here's a newsflash: Guys look at porn. Good dads look at porn, bad dads look at porn. Not all dads, and not all guys, but it's rarely the problem a lot of people seem to think it is. My theory is that in this case, it's only a problem because you've decided it's a problem.<br>  <br>  Does he go to work? Does he hold down a job? Do you two still have awesome sex? Do you go out for dinner, or cook together? <br>  <br>  The point is this: aside from irritating you, does it really have a terrible effect on your relationship? If not, he's not "addicted" in any classic sense, because his life is not being generally disrupted by it.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I'll certainly give you leeway on the fact that it bothers you. But guys are always going to want to look at pretty women, and it doesn't mean he's going to or even wants to cheat or leave you; it doesn't really mean anything more than YOU make it mean. The only thing it means is that he's human, and expecting him to never feel even the slightest interest in any other woman ever is highly unrealistic, and really unhealthy, because chances are almost 100% that he's going to have those feelings.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but marriage is a partnership. You can't argue over every little thing that bothers you. If you fly off the handle every time he leaves a dirty sock on the floor, chances are good there won't be any more socks lying around - or any more him. You have to learn to pick your battles.<br>  <br>  You've told him this bothers you, he has made a concerted effort to back off, but if you keep pushing the issue, it's going to start looking a lot less like partnership and comfort for you and a lot more like manipulation.<br>  <br>  Let the guy look at a little porn, and learn to appreciate him with all of his (perceived) faults, and not punish him for being a human being.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Well, first, I think you need to ask yourself why it bothers you so much.  Maybe try looking at it with him.  It could  be what you see as an addiction truly isn't and is just jealously.  <br>  <br>  If it is an addiction, than counseling is the route to take.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	ALL men look at porn, the focus should be on why you feel so threatened by it.|`|bcZSIphUaa	I really feel for you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be able to handle this if it was my Fiance.<br>  <br>  I'm lucky in that my Fiance is not interested in porn and doesn't even want to see other women naked.<br>  <br>  He thinks that this is rude to me and he honestly gets his kicks out of looing at me! His words!<br>  <br>  I'm lucky. I don't know what you can do about it - life is harder for women because of this basic drive that most men have.|`|hL4nWbzmaa	you can install NetDog Porn Filter : <a href="http://www.netdogsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdogsoft.com</a> on the computer, netdog blocks all porn quitely and automatically in the background when anyone's on the computer.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	Porn is ok!  When done to much it is an addiction as in his case.  If he is concerned he will seek help.|`|pub2GLZPaa	I can't believe some people on here are encouraging you to watch it with him. So, if he was an alcoholic, would you drink with him? No.<br>  <br>  The truth of the matter is he has to want to change. If he does, then get him to a therapist and go with him.  There are also a number of self help books written about this for guys who would rather go that route.<br>  <br>  I think you have to lay down some boundaries on what will make you stay around and what won't. How big a problem is this for you? Is it a deal breaker?
hkwBR1moaa	THe wedding officiant is the person who performs your ceremony.  He has to be certified to marry someone in your state.  They shouldn't charge more then 200-250.  THey will normally come to wherever your cermony is being held.  If you are having it in a church, most churches already have the officiant (priest, minister, deacon, etc.) so ask them.  You will have to get the paperwork and then you will have to file it.  Sometimes the officiant will file it, but I would definitely follow up on it if he does.    You an find them at your church as previously mentioned, google wedding officiants/ whatever state your in, or you can look in the phone book under weddings.  If you are having the ceremony at the same place as your reception, sometimes they will be able to provide you with officiant referrals.  If you really want to be different, you can always have a family member or friend ordained on line and then they can marry you.  Also, judges can marry you.  As far as when to book them, you can do that whenever you want.  I'm getting married 04/11 and I booked mine two weeks ago.  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ACecbVghaa	The officiant is the person who marries you, he performs the wedding ceremony. It can be a judge or a minister or anyone ordained to perform weddings in your state. Their rates vary by area and travel time. Your first step would be to ask your pastor to marry you. If you don't have a pastor, check around with family and friends for recommendations.

91XVWCWWaa	Please make a list for your friends to follow as you and they will be in a different mode once your reception starts.  <br>  <br>  1. Guests arrive (soft music should be playing)<br>  2. Bridal party announced (this includes flower girl,ring                        bearer,bridesmaids,groomsmen,maid/matron of honor and best man)<br>  3. Bride and Groom announced (Mr. & Mrs.  ________)<br>  <br>  4. Bride & Groom go directly to cake table (This gets the cake picture taken at the perfect time before the cake starts to droop due to room temperature)<br>  5. Bride & Groom (should be served even with a buffet)<br>  6. Bridal Party (goes through buffet line first)<br>  7. Guests now may go through buffet line<br>  8. After you have finished eating (please know that your guests and relatives will be interacting with you as you eat) have them announce that the first dance (Bride & Groom) will be taking place shortly.<br>  9. Father/Daughter dance,Mother/Son dance<br>  10. Everyone else can join in<br>  11. Bouquet Toss (clear dance floor, have single ladies stand and wait to catch the bouquet)<br>  12. Garter Toss (Bride sits in chair, groom comes up to remove garter, then garter is tossed to single guys)<br>  13. Announce that the guest can enjoy the cake!<br>  <br>  There are variations to the above, but you want to make sure that all posed (portrait) pictures are done at the beginning of the reception and not at the end.  This allows your dress, makeup, shoes, flowers to look fresh in the pictures.  Otherwise your dress will be smudged with dirt, makeup smeared from crying, shoes off the feet because after awhile you want to be comfortable and flowers will not be wilted.|`|dHPA390Qaa	This is a hard question to answer because of the volume of information people could give you.<br>  I will only make one suggestion- be sure that you make a list of pictures that you DO want.

AA10873763	If a person is prepared to follow through, there's nothing wrong with it.<br>  If a person is using it as a manipulation device, they deserve what they get.<br>  In the case of a proposal, if one person wants to be married but the other person doesn't, how long should they wait to see if they change their mind?  There's nothing wrong with ending a relationship because the people are in different life stages or have different goals.  Breaking up gives each person the chance to meet someone more compatible.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Depends on the ultimatum.<br>  <br>  Ultimatums should only really be given for abusive situations, real drugs, alcoholism, always hanging out with his friends, etc.<br>  <br>  Not for having female friends, the once or twice a month strip club trip, and porn watching, unless he watches it everyday.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	I'm generally against them because if somebody is only asking you due to an ultimatum, then it's kind of meaningless.  If they're not sure they really want to marry you, it's usually a sign you shouldn't be getting married.  I can understand, though, why people who have been dating for long periods of time without a proposal can be skeptical about whether they will ever be engaged and may feel like they should move on if it hasn't happened after a while.  It may be better to set a deadline in your mind for how long you'll wait and not mention it to your partner.  I also think talking openly about marriage- when you want to be married and why you do or don't is the most important thing.  I know some people will lie about wanting to get married so their partner won't break up with them.  But generally speaking somebody who has a reason why they're waiting will be able to talk about it openly and freely.  Somebody who really doesn't want to ever get married or think about will just completely avoid the subject.  It's also important that the person who's waiting for the proposal listens with an open mind and doesn't complain too strongly.  If you are too negative about waiting for a proposal, then even the other person wants to marry you, they may avoid talking about it just because they're afraid to get nagged at.|`|oojO4WAraa	If someone gives me an ultimatum - I almost always take the "I'm leaving" option.  I don't think they work.  And if they work in the short term, that doesn't mean forcing someone to marry you will work in the long term.  You will end up divorced.  <br>  <br>  Some one says to me  "do x or leave"   I head for the door.|`|F4k68ilkaa	Why would you want to have to FORCE a man to marry you? Seems kinda...insulting to me.<br>  <br>  I want him to WANT to. If he doesn't want to, maybe it's time to move on, if that is what you're set on.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If someone is so childish that they feel they need to resort to ultimatums, they have no business getting married. If this what they are like before getting married, then married life will be hell for the guy. <br>  <br>  Who is to say the wife won't constantly say: "You don't really love me if you won't (fill in the blank with some silliness isn't even worth threatening anyone over). Otherwise I'll divorce you!" ? It will only get worse from there.<br>  <br>  If someone gives me an ultimatum, I automatically refuse to do whatever it is they want. Most other people react the same way.|`|woOeYFrEaa	How about...it depends.  ;)<br>  <br>  I almost used one on my husband.  We'd been best friends for 7 years, and seriously dating for 2 years.  I never did tell him "propose by x date or I'm gone" but I did have a date in my head.  I had several long conversations with him that went something like this, "I love you, I want to get married some day and have children, if you don't want to do that you need to let me know so I can move on."  I loved him and wanted to spend my life with him but he was extremely commitment-phobic and wasn't sure he wanted to get married.  I was already in my 30s and wasn't willing to wait until I was too old to have kids to realize he didn't really want a marriage and family.<br>  <br>  So all of that story to say that I don't think I ever would have given him an ultimatum but if we'd reached the internal deadline in my head I would have broken things off and moved on.  You don't want to force the other person into marrying you but you also need to know if they'll never be ready so you can go find someone who will be.<br>  <br>  Happy ending for us, we've been married a year and are blissfully happy and he proposed without any huge prods from me.|`|66393fcb8deb9226aa9427ed74300258aa	I think it depends on the situation. If the guy is just "resting on his laurels" and keeps just spewing bs about waiting, then an ultimatum might be best becuase then you will know whether it's just talk or if he's going to grow a pair and ask you. The thing is, you have to acutally walk if the alloted time passes and it hasn't happened. hopefully, he will realize that you were serious and beg you to come back to him but if he doesn't, then you were better off without him.<br>  <br>  Personally, I haven't done it in such precise way. I've been with my bf for over 4 1/2 years and he hasn't asked me yet. I know money is the issue, but he knows I don't want a huge rock or big fancy wedding. I just want him and our relationship to go to the next step and start a faily with him in the next few years. He knows I would like it before the end of the year (which I'm really hoping will happen!) but I didn't say "or else". It will happen this year though, I'm sure of it. He just said that he is tryting to save for it.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	In any situation, if you give an ultimatum, you must plan to and then follow through or else it is useless and meaningless.  You must plan to live with the consequences - it can't be for manipulation, otherwise it is not really an ultimatum, but a manipulative threat.<br>  <br>  If you give him the ultimatum, you must be very serious about ending it if he does not do as you wish.  If he chooses not to propose, then you have your answer and need to move on.<br>  <br>  An ultimatum is only good if you really plan to do as you say - otherwise it is a waste of time and energy and not truly an ultimatum, but a manipulation.|`|8K3IucU3aa	i hate ultimatums. if someone says "propose before summer or im leaving" makes me think they don't care whether they're ready for marriage. all they care about is that they are ready to be married and aren't willing to wait. when a guy proposes to me i don't want to be expecting it. i don't want to pressure him into something he's not ready for and i don't want him to try to hurry and get ready because i might leave. if someone would walk out on a relationship because they don't get what they want, then they don't need to be in a relationship.|`|pub2GLZPaa	I am against. <br>  <br>  If I gave a guy one, and he finally came around and agreed to whatever I wanted, I would always be wondering if he really wanted to do that or if he was being forced to (well thats a no-brainer).<br>  <br>  I dont want to feel I have to FORCE someone to want to spend their life with me. I always felt that when he's ready, he'll ask. Ultimatums are a way of saying..... ok I really know where I'm at, I really want you to be there with me too, but in reality..... thats not the case.<br>  <br>  Don't you want someone who CRAVES you? and DREAMS of spending their life with you? not someone who you had to squeeze it out of?|`|6jZcr33paa	I was with my fiance for 4 years and we had a 3 year old daughter when I told him if he wasn't ready to get married after all that then I felt I was wasting my time. He still didn't feel we needed to be married so I told him I couldn't be with him. We were still civil with each other for our daughter though and at her 4th birthday we decided to begin seeing each other again and two months later he proposed. <br>  <br>  Things fall into place when they need to just sometimes you may have to give them a little push.|`|yvq7AtJuaa	I think that it all depends on the situation.  In some circumstances, like pregnancy perhaps, yes.  Others, no.|`|w1necKzYaa	I disagree with all of these people! I think they work it just depends on the way you say it! I told my now fiance that I was not going to wait forever! and about 6 months later he proposed!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My view is if they don't want to marry me, why force the issue? If he/she is "the one", they will know and in due time everything will come to terms. I find that the people who are waiting around for the proposal and contemplating the ultimatum are not seeing the big picture - there's a reason you're not engaged, why not try to figure out what that reason is before issuing ultimatums? <br>  <br>  I have a friend who's fiancee gave him an "expiration date" of 8/8/08, and the date went right on by without a hitch - she didn't follow through and she has no idea why he doesn't want to marry her. That couple has a LOT of issues and I could write up a list of reasons why they shouldn't get married lol... his "new expiration date" is 9/9/09... Poor guy!|`|YCSGSlXkaa	Maybe it doesn't need to be an ultimatum.  Maybe it can just be "Look, I feel very unsure about where our relationship is headed, and for me to be happy with our relationship means I want to get married.  If you're not ready to get married, then we need to talk about what that means for the relationship."  Maybe not exactly that, but something like that?  I think that might be more productive than a straight out ultimatum, but still gets the point across that you are ready to get married and want him to **** or get off the pot.|`|AA10452323	Giving someone an ultimatum is putting them on the spot.  No one likes to be put on the spot.  If this is about a wedding proposal, then just think...you will always have in the back of your mind that he might not have asked you if you didn't give him the ultimatum.  You don't want to force some one to be with you.  If you have to do that, then it's just not worth it.  If you really love some one then you should be willing to wait until they are comfortable.  Ask your self this too....What would your reaction be to an ultimatum.  Life is alot easier if you live by this one simple rule:<br>  Put yourself in other peoples shoes, before you open your mouth.|`|GsSRY7quaa	most of the time, when you back someone in a corner with an ultimatum, you will not get the response you are looking for, you get the opposite. what you should do is if you want to get married or proposed to, sit that person down and talk to them. they may have a specific reason for not doing it at this time (wanting to get bills our of the way, save for college, not sure you are the one and only, etc.). it could be almost anything. so ask open questions and see how they are answered.|`|cgQqHJtKaa	I prefer to think of it as giving yourself an ultimatum, not the other person. <br>  <br>  Say to yourself, If this man isn't ready to marry me by next summer, I am getting on with my life. Make it about what you want, what you are going to do about it, rather than getting in his face about what he has to do. <br>  <br>  Discuss it, so he knows where your thoughts are.|`|Au32tyxGaa	It kind of depends on the sort of relationship you have.....<br>  <br>  I mean I kind of did one night: I told my b/f at the time "Ok, well I want to be at least engaged before we buy a house."<br>  <br>  Well..... we bought a house and two weeks after we moved in - he proposed.....<br>  <br>  I mean some guys can't take a hint and you kind of just have to tell them straight up.... But, if you gave an ultimatum to other guys they would do the opposite.... so it just all depends....|`|hsZnjZvoaa	Making demands on people is very hard.  I spent many years living my life to make others happy - now I have learned that my opinions and feelings are important, too.  I know if someone said marry me (or whatever the ultimatum is) or else, I'd choose the or else.|`|vULVL1jmaa	I don't think ultimatums work when it comes to the subject of marriage. If someone isn't ready for marriage, you need to open up a discussion with them and see if/when marriage is a possibility and go from there.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I do not think there is a need for an ultimatum. If a guy wants to marry you he will ask you. The fact that he hasn't speaks for itself. I would either move on or accept it.|`|dHPA390Qaa	An ultimatum is a promise a person makes to themselves, but ends up being shared with the target.|`|cSGfoQWEaa	If they are ready, they will ask.  Most people don't like having something forced upon them.|`|05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	It depends on the situation. If you've been with a guy for awhile (more than a couple of years) and he knows you've been waiting for him to pop the question, I think you have a right to set a deadline. You can't put your life on hold forever, and what if he finally decides that you're not the one? Then you've wasted a good portion of your young life that you can't get back. Life is too short to drag your feet, especially when you have things you want to accomplish, like having kids and raising a family.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way: we work with deadlines all of the time. What if his boss said, "We need a new printer for the office. I want you to evaluate ABC and XYZ, and give me your recommendation by Friday." If he's smart, he's going to spend the next few days looking at the pros and cons of each model, and based on what he knows and what he can find out, he's going to choose.<br>  <br>  Yes, deciding on whether or not to marry someone is a much bigger decision than picking a printer, but the process of making that decision is the same. Is this the person I want to spend the rest of my life with? What are the things I like about her? What are the things I don't like? Can I live with the things I don't like? People do change over time, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, but he can still make a decision based on what he knows now, and he can get input from other people that know the two of you in helping him make a decision.<br>  <br>  If the guy's a foot-dragger and doesn't want to make a decision or can't make a decision, and you're go-getter, you are going to be continually frustrated with him for the rest of your life. I have seen so many wives in that situation, and it's frustrating because it will seem like you're nagging when all you're trying to do is get stuff done. If he's a foot-dragger/procrastinator now, chances are he will always be one.
QPp7zQQpaa	That would be the same as asking "my sister is a genius, does that mean i will be one someday"?<br>  No, you are an individual, and most criminal personalities are molded by many different types of influences, from what kind of pregnancy your mom had, to genes, raising, environment, to drugs or substance abuse.<br>  Do not worry about that, and now that you are aware he is doing things the wrong way, do not imitate him, ever.|`|PBdPD748aa	of course not!! only YOU control what you become! siblings in most cases are completely different people with completely different personalities - i know i am and so is my fiance with our sets of siblings!!<br>  <br>  that is a very narrow minded thing to say. whilst your parents may have an influence on the choices you make as a child, your siblings certainly do not (brothers or sisters). but when you get to the age wheere you can think for yourself only you can influense yourself :)<br>  <br>  focus on being a productive and good person in society and that is what you will become|`|COs7vGWSaa	That is a dumb question. No Just because he is doesn't mean you will be. Being a criminal isn'tthereditaryy. if hes the only influence in your life theres a possibility that you might, only because thats the only person molding you. But if hes not then you should turn out ok. You follow your own path not someone elses and you'll be fine|`|15JDwvRKaa	it all depends on u. if u think wat ur brother is doing is rite or something, u probably will. if u dont seem wat ur brother is doing is wrong stay away from wat hes doing and u will b alright.|`|SDJ1I8wraa	no it doesnt mean u will b. u will b if u like hang out wit him to much tho. believe me i'd know.|`|gsAurTdxaa	NO! my brother just got out of jail and im not a criminal...
PBdPD748aa	honestly i would just ignore him. he is probably worried that if he speaks to you or anything like that it could put his career in jeopardy knowing that you have feelings for him (as it is illegal) so he is probably staying on the safe side and avoiding contact with you as much as possible. that wont change, at least not for a while. so you dont look like an idiot i think you should ignore him, dont say hi anymore and just give him lots and lots of space. he will notice the difference and it should make him be able to warm up and be comfortable again, because knowing that you like him put him in a very awkward and compromising position as a teacher.|`|PrRtIvvzaa	flash him|`|V8wbyKohaa	anal always breaks the ice
5j1Uhg2Gaa	Yep your just imagining it. What you are going through is called a crush. Sometimes your mind will play tricks on you when you have a crush on someone.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	I believe that you may have met the girl/boy from a dream, well, her soul .,  can you describe parts of her/him. It's hard to believe, but true! It can be a truly comforting feeling, to know that you may have at last found that someone, the one you have spent a lifetime with previously, only to find her/him again, and continue it all over.
8erharZMaa	I think that once you develop feelings for someone, they never really go away. I would try hanging out with her and putting the feelings past her, if you can't handle it then be honest with her.
Zp61sxNraa	There's a strong distinction between going out to have a good time with friends, and getting absolutely annibrhiated to the point of black out drunk. First of all, "blacking out" is extremely dangerous, not only to your health but to many other aspects of your life (social, behavioral, psychological) And although it may only be happening but once a week, it may be a gateway to either more drinking or more fowl play leading up to the excuse "I blacked out, or I just wanted to hang with my buddies." There comes a time in every man's life where he needs to take the time to realize the responsibilities at hand. Shouting, anger or rage or any kind of physical/verbal violence or abuse be it drunk or not, is not only unsafe for your fiance, but also your unborn child. I've seen this happen to so many people I know,I'm not in your position so I can't tell you what to do, but I think deep in your heart you should do what feels right. Try having a sit-down and discussing reasons for binge drinking, or other emotions/feelings/stresses that may cause him to drink to that point. I wouldn't say cut him off completely from his friends, but he can have a good time without blacking out, and that may be something you may want to discuss!  This may also sound nutty, but sometimes counseling and therapy may be effective method for airing out these issues.<br>  Again it's ultimately your decision, but for yourself and your child, talk it out, and I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you can work it out.|`|AA10010935	When alcohol resorts to verbal and emotional abuse, that's serious.  Even though it's only once a week, if he can't stop drinking, then he definitely has a problem.   You both need to realize that you have a baby coming soon.   He/she is going to be affected by this.   He will have to smarten up and stop drinking.  If he can't then he needs help.   You have to be the strong one and do what's right for your baby.   Strongly encourage him to get help for this.  If he refuses, then you have to consider if this relationship is worth saving.   Remember, it's not just the two of you anymore.   I hope things work out for all of you.  Good luck.
2wZhVA8faa	aww. haha there is no "right way" to kiss! :) <br>  <br>  Just do what feels right and natural for you! Kissing can be a hard thing to do until you get comfortable doing it, and while nothing can fully prepare you for a kiss, you just have to practice... :) Practice makes perfect. <br>  <br>  Everybody kisses differently... so just use what you know and incorporate it with what your guy does. :)|`|3pnQ5zhWaa	i think evveryone feels that why<br>  just keep on practicing on him lol
4POGapREaa	Ugh.  I was a size 3 or 5 in street clothes & had to order a size 8 in my wedding dress.  Then I proceeded to pack on the lbs JUST for my wedding (sarcasm) and had to exchange that for a size 10.  I've never been a size 10 in my life in any piece of clothing & for some reason that was very disturbing to me LOL!<br>  <br>  The 1st time I tried on dresses, not knowing there was a difference in bridal from regular clothes, the girl looked me up & down and said "you're probably around a size 8".  I thought she was purposely being a b*tch HA HA!|`|wMWfCjBpaa	The average is to bump up two sizes. Some designers do differ. I'm a 0/2 street size and bought a size 6 in one gown and a 4 in another. Remember, better to take in than let out.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	At David's Bridal, my dress size was my wedding dress size-it was nice to be able to pick up any size 10 in the place and have it basically fit (except of course for halter straps, etc...they always make straps too long, since it's easier to shorten a strap than lengthen it).<br>  <br>  And also, I found Jasmine gowns were quite similar too-their size 10 also fit my shape.|`|fUBWB88laa	Normally wedding dresses run two sizes smaller than normal clothes...depending on the designer of course. I wear a size 6 in street clothes and they ordered my dress in a 10...well I got to the boutique two weeks ago to try on the 10 and it was too big....so they just finished altering, taking it in two inches on each side! ugh...more money for alterations than if they'd let me order the size 8 like I knew I'd fit into, but it's all good. It still looks amazing so I can't complain.|`|AA10018260	I wear a 10! Can u beleive it??  What is up with dresses?! I don't get it.  I am skinny yet I am a 10.  So if u wear a bigger size then normal for your wedding dress do not worry about it.  One of my bridesmaids is a 10 too and she is not big at all.  She is smaller than me actually.  Do not worry u will be beautiful.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i'm pretty sure the rack size was a 20... but it has been taken in about 8" now... i bought it off a girl that bought 2 dresses and thought it would be ok but it was way too big so i had it taken in... and then i lost more weight, a lot more... its had to be taken in like 3 times now<br>  wedding is 9 days away now so hopefully today will be the last time :||`|TJKvoLeBaa	My dress had to be ordered in a size 16 and I wear a 9/10 normally  in regular clothes.  They would have ordered a 14  but I have a large chest and they went up to a 16 to make sure that the bust fits.  <br>  I think it is funny how the sizes run small.  You would think they would run the opposit way since it is a wedding gown and you want to make a bride feel good...not like a blob.hahah<br>  My friend that wears a 2 about died when they told her they would be ordering her dress in an 8.  She is so vain that she literally argued with the bridal consultant for like ten min and then told her that she was a "bridal insultant".  hahahha It was pure comedy, a maidzilla and a shop consultant that was a middle age New Yorker...it was great.|`|vyL7yEleaa	i ordered a size 18 just to be on the absolute safe side since the dress is no longer produced and if the dress came in too small i would be really really screwed! i fit into a 16 mori lee.. but i was fitting into a size 14 davids. so each dress maker is different when it comes to their sizing. <br>  <br>  i ordered up because a dress can be taken from a size 24 to a size 0.. but it is really hard to let out a dress.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I would have ordered a 0 based on my measurements but the smallest size they made in my dress was a 2. So I ordered a 2 thinking I would have to take it in "a little" here and there. Their size 2 was more like a 6! Needless to say, a lot of work had to be done on that dress. But it all worked out in the end.|`|B98HwU6Yaa	im a size 6 in jeans and a size small in shirts. my measurements are 36.5 bust x 25.5 waist x 36.5 hips. so my dress would be a size 6 in the bust, size 2 to 4 in the waist and a 1 in the hips lol.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I'm getting my custom.  No size YAY lol<br>  <br>  But when I went to davidbridal it would have been a size 26 :(  I know I'm chubby, but I'm a size 18 in jeans.

I don't want to be too skinny.|`|omr1Kv3Haa	0|`|dAfUEMDKaa	It is a lable size 14.  (Jeans size 10).  I was like huhhhh...you demon spawn...when she told me the size she was ordering.

Pass it over here! I am totally in need!!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Sure...I'll take a puff of that. <br>  <br>  Peace to you! =)|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Yes Babe... there's way too much tension and not enough caring lately. <br>  <br>  I think we all need to get those blow-up Sumo wrestler outfits on and beat the crap out of each other till we laugh again.|`|LDv4dqLraa	Any chance you could pass a peace 'roll up' instead. Whichever, I want a drag of it please :-)|`|U7d3Ft9baa	yes please pass it around here i will give if a puff.|`|rPywKtJRaa	Oh pass it home to momma!!!  there is so much tention I just need to blow some smoke!!!  lol
AleWgjvPaa	I can't think of any way that Apple red would be extreme. If you love the colour, use the colour!|`|CzKrqgmgaa	who cares what day or time your wedding is. if you fell in love with the color then use it! its not about what others will think or what is normal... its YOUR wedding|`|QFnaCs5saa	I am personally a fan of victorian lilac...but black white and red...there is just something sexy about that color combo! Pick whatever color looks best on the girls...that's probably the best way to go because either color is very appropriate!|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I think apple would be fine and I love that color and hey do what makes you happy. I am getting married in a burgundy dress in a church and my mom is giving me away and my fiance and best man and ring bearer are wearing black suits, black shirts and dark red ties, and the junior bridesmaid is wearing burgundy. Why be traditional and BTW I am getting married at 1:00 on a Saturday and I don't think that it is too extreme and it will be June 6th.|`|vyL7yEleaa	the apple red was going to be my colors since i loved the red. but when i tried them on the girls it just didn't look right on them. <br>  <br>  red is a very pretty color but is a little stand outish and will (as my fiance is stating behind me) will most likely take away from you as people are naturally drawn to red. <br>  <br>  i would say though for the wedding the lilac would be a calmer color and not stand out so bright but it really is up to you.|`|omr1Kv3Haa	Don't worry about it. It summer - all bright colors allowed anytime :)  I think red will turn out very nice.|`|dAfUEMDKaa	I have seen the apple at a few weddings and it is too cute.  I really had to argue with myself not to do it.  Our wedding is in the fall and we chose the latte and truffle colors.  I did really like the apple though.  I think it would be fine.  Good luck.|`|iDfRTLklaa	Its your wedding, do what ever you want.  I love the colour red, it suits most colouring which is a bonus when you have to cater for a few different people.

6my2NqzBaa	Hey Go up say Hi and ask him how he like the party the other night then that will be your ice breaker.... he will then know you a little more and then you wouldn't be asking if he liked you you would just be carring on a converstaion.. Who knows maybe he will ask you out...|`|fAKKv0ytaa	If you haven't yet talked to him, he only likes your body. He probably won't talk to you until you initiate something, so you need to just talk to him and give him a hint the first chance you have, especially if he's in your class, if you just stare and do nothing you will confuse him more.|`|pdIWs1qgaa	Staring doesn't always mean you like someone. Sometimes, rarely, once in a blue moon, people space out and daydream during class. They look around. It seems like you two don't even know each other. Hang out with him at lunch or something.
y9CgveCGaa	Just be supportive.  Help him plan for his kids future.  Talk about happy things.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	By doing and being anything they ask...|`|4wmbnr3Saa	my heart would brake Flor in this situation, but if anyone can do a good job it will be you, i would say respect his wishes of not telling anyone but then again i think his family has the right to know what is going in his life and try and talk to him about that...<br>  <br>  other than that being there for him in anything he needs to talk to you about is more than you can do...Best of luck for you..|`|uW1ZlA2Haa	Brave man . <br>  Make him laugh . Remind him of the time when ________ .......  <br>  I hope the teens are able to stay in the same routine  as long as possible Try to help him and his family set something up for them when he is gone . <br>  Maybe a video of him to them.<br>  Who he would like for them to stay with .<br>  Who to go to when they need help (who they can trust )<br>  Where they should go to school<br>   He must feel good about knowing that they will be OK  .<br>  Good Luck|`|r5wK05N5aa	By telling them how much you love them and how much they will be missed. Remember and speak of the good times you had together. Remind him of the hope we have for the future, Revelation 21:3,4. And that we have the hope of a resurrection.<br>  I am truly sorry Flor.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	besides being there for him, being supportive etc.,<br>  <br>  try to get through to him - this is not necessarily a death sentence. I understand the shock (been there) but he needs to understand that there's always hope. a good friend is now over a year past a terminal diagnosis - yes, with chemo and everything else. and life looks better already, there's still hope. <br>  you need to try and rally his spirit and if for no other reason, he needs to try for the children's sake. every extra month or year will be a cherished gift!<br>  tackle it like a "project" - make a plan, work out stages and by all means, include planning for what happens when he's no longer around - whenever that may be. this should get him thinking of practical matters and make him dwell less on the "unfairness" of it all.<br>  get him to go to the links below and read.|`|8EqCR5tKaa	Talk about whatever he wants to talk about. Even if it's just talking about the weather, I am sure that would be fine with him, anything to get his mind off the cancer. Of course, if he wants to talk about the cancer, talk to him about that too. Be supportive no matter what. {hugs} Things like this are not easy, but you will make it through. Just be there, even if you feel like you have nothing to say.|`|Qk7xiIkNaa	This will be difficult-but you should encourage him to make sure all of him affairs are in order.  For instance his will etc for the children.  He could even arrange and pay for his funeral now and then it will be easier for the children to cope.  Encourage him to be responsible to the children as survivors and even plan for their care after he is gone.  Perhaps a family member would take care of them.  He needs to face these things now his time is very limited.|`|hz7Ek1HKaa	I'm very very sorry Flor!!!<br>  <br>  ((((((((((( Flor )))))))))<br>  <br>  if you need anything I'm here for you!!!|`|936dFoLeaa	I've never been through this personally, and I hope I never will. I can understand the feeling of loss though. If I were you I'd just tell him flat out..Look I know you don't wanna talk about it, but there's no way of getting around it. Tell him how you feel and I'm sure he'll feel like you're being selfish, because he is the one who is dying, but I'd still just tell him my exact thoughts and feelings...tell him how bad this is affecting you and how bad you think it will affect his children. Tell him to care about his kids and the closure they need to move on in life, I'm sure he doesn't want them to feel any anger towards him once he's gone. They should get the oppurtunity to let him know anything and everything they want him to know before he dies!<br>  <br>  I wish you good luck with this situation, and may God be with you and him & his family in this time.
KtR0NstMaa	Good for you.  Getting drunk and etc is not going to get you anywhere in life but bring you trouble.   Stay away from the "bad" crowd and start hanging out with people like yourself.   <br>  <br>  I know it may seem the non-drinkers are far and few between but pick your friends very carefully.  Drinking buys TROUBLE!   I cannot state that too loudly!|`|kVDWn3uvaa	ignore him. I don't think a good friend would just put you down like that and you should do what you want to do don't listen to him|`|rCOI8xDaaa	"I stay true to myself all the time."<br>  <br>  Buddy did u get that from disney?<br>  <br>  cause dude your life sounds pretty boring and happy... TOOO happy<br>  <br>  Your a loser. Get a life. please.|`|XCk0IOQIaa	You know your friend does have a point.<br>  <br>  Scenario: He's out partying; You're posting questions on Yahoo! Answers<br>  <br>  I'd say you're a fu?king loser|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Some people think their lifestyle is the only one that matters. It doesn't mean he's a bad guy or anything, just a tad narrow-minded. Don't let that comment hurt your friendship with him.|`|1LEa5iVHaa	your life is not boring. it is what you make it! i too dont see partying really living either! if he isnt cool with your life being "boring" than he isnt worth making it exciting (just to please him)

gPeEdjmuaa	I would send you to some boot camp for misbehaving kids! Wow, i have never heard something so deceitful! You pretended to be your dad and get a credit card while spending 3,000 DOLLARS!?!? You're nuts!! Come clean about it BEFORE he gets notified my the bank. Sit him down and just be like, "Dad, I need to talk to you about something very serious. I have been very fraudulent with your trust. I took your account and card information to open up a credit card in your name that I have been using. I used it to spend 3,000 dollars *be prepared  to help your Dad up when he faints* and have been deceiving. I'm out of line and I needed to come clean. I take full responsibility for my actions and I will pay you back the debt I know owe you. Please forgive me." Good luck my friend, your gonna need it. You have to learn to take responsibility for your actions sooner or later.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Umm. Talk to your dad and stop posting this. I hid a pregnancy until the day I went into labor and I feel like an angel compared to you. Good luck though. E-mail me after you talk to your dad. If he ever lets you on the computer again.|`|vqEaTmU2aa	Okay, I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say there (as there is a lot of repetition) but honestly, do you think being sent to boarding school would solve everything? Not only are most of them often very difficult to get into academically, but they are really expensive and probably would be difficult on your parents. Seriously, do you think that would solve all of your problems?<br>  <br>  People make mistakes. They just do. It's part of who we are. You just have to admit that you're human, and I highly doubt you've done so many "bad" things. But even so, if you have to admit what you've done to people, just be honest. Tell them not to judge you, and that you realize you made a big mistake. If they are good people, they will forgive you (and I imagine they will, I mean can what you did really be that bad?)<br>  <br>  I understand that you feel really bad, like you just want to get out of where you are. But you probably won't be able to do that until you are in college, which will come sooner than you think.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|52otNiElaa	You're outa line boy.

u7Y1SAViaa	A best friend, in my opinion, is someone who is practically your sister/brother and tells you the straight truth with no exceptions but still has a little sympathy towards you. A best friend is someone who's there when you're depressed and doesn't give a damn if she's missing a concert or party. A best friend punches a boy in the face when you thought he liked you but just wanted to feel up on you when you were vulnerable. A best friend helps you become a greater person and influences you to do the good and dismiss the bad. A best friend is your other half.|`|8EqCR5tKaa	Someone who will put up with you, good AND bad, and accepts you no matter what. For the most part. :)
PBdPD748aa	thats just ridiculous. she is doing it because you are all allowing her. why is she getting control in YOUR house? I wonder how your wife feels about this... i wouldnt be happy at all. she is on a bit of a power trip, dont allow this to continue. your daughters safety is number 1 and you need to have a serious talk to her about what is acceptable and unacceptable. she needs to know her boundaries, she shouldnt be able to control things like heating and water temp in your house. goodness!|`|GegQJNzSaa	Maybe a electric blanket will help. The hot tub of water makes your arthritis feel better. Fill the kids tub yourself so you know your kids are safe.If they are older,warn them! Things could be worse,she could have Alzheimer's!|`|HE56Jra6aa	Hot flashes...They are a +++++. remember you'll get old some day, So go easy and help your Parent and talk to them... They just may shock you and understand more than you think.|`|vqEaTmU2aa	Wow, it sounds like things are getting difficult for you guys. And my grandmother had rheumatoid arthritis (I think that's what you're referring to?) so I sort of understand what you are going through.<br>  <br>  But yeah, you should tell her what you said about your daughter burning herself, if she even so much as considers the possibility of her granddaughter getting injured, I would certainly imagine that she would reconsider doing what she's doing.<br>  <br>  If that isn't the case... well, maybe it's time to put her in the good old home. Though hopefully not.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Tell her you are going to set the thermostat and she isn't to touch it. She can wear a sweater or curl up in a blanket. Explain that you can't afford the electric and gas bills. While you understand that she has medical issues, that doesn't mean that you can afford to pay for the utilities either. If she is unhappy about that then you might check with social services in your city and see if you can get her into some kind of program they offer.
XT81GCu1aa	I would try one more time to talk to her face to face.  If she still has an attitude, try to hang out with other friends more until/if she comes around.  Unfortunately some people take THEIR problems out on the people closest to them (in this case, you.)  She is really overreacting, and if she is truly sorry, let her know that you are still there for her but you will not be a doormat.  You don't mistreat her, so you shouldn't be mistreated either.|`|GUXOxiGiaa	This is going to depend if you think your friendship with her was special and you are up to help her. If you are not an empathetic person than not really. If she was a friend you truly want in your life than help her. Remind her the good times. Then the rest shall come to you that will flow... <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JdtLTvRGaa	i had a fight with one of my besties who id known 4 ages.  to b honest she was very tempremental and took the slightest thing u said as an insult. our friendship atm is at the same level as urs. my guess is to wait and see how things play out. if she doesnt give u the cold shoulder then maybe try talking to her again, perhaps ull get that friendship back|`|Reydkvhtaa	let her be stupid about things. it wont get better if she doesnt want to fix it.<br>  just give her space and hopefuly she will get over it :)|`|68o68mENaa	Ok now seeing as you both are angry, I think you should listen to you friend.<br>  Talk when you're ready.<br>  It's no use to try and solve something when you both are already mad.<br>  There will just be a lot of yelling and arguing and nothing will be solved.<br>  You'll know when you're ready to talk to her when you yourself aren't as mad anymore.<br>  <br>  And don't throw away this friendship over one argument.<br>  As you said, you were best friends for 2 years.<br>  Don't waste that.<br>  And if you really feel like you want to stop the friendship with her, give it a lot of thought first.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|lc51V6EAaa	maybe you should tell her she is being bitchy and she should stop
Q37YNI68aa	Girl, I want iron Maiden for walking down the Isle.<br>  <br>  This marriage is about YOU AND YOUR FIANCE.  If that is what you guys want, then go for it!<br>  <br>  Dont let anyone tell you otherwise, because this is YOUR DAY not theirs.<br>  <br>  And the song choice has absolutely NOTHING to do with how serious you are about each other.  It just means that you want your wedding ot be about you and be unique and not like every other wedding out there,.<br>  <br>  I support your choice, but even f I didnt,,,Why should you care?  Its your day, have fun!|`|S5GP2nlUaa	Hey it's your wedding you do as you please. Heck I am walking down the isle to Stealing Cinderella.  The first dance though is usually a nice slow song, but its whatever. And don't listen to these idiot who say it's not respecting your vows because if you know what they mean then go for it. It's just a song, not something horrible.|`|QFnaCs5saa	No seriously, your wedding is about what YOU and your fiance want. You don't have to follow these traditional "protocols" that everyone always refers to. It's YOUR day, you or your family is paying for it...don't let anyone steal your thunder, don't make decision that's imposed on you by someone else and then later on you regret! Do make sure that the songs have significance to you though, because you want to remember why you chose your fun and creative choices when your children or whomever ask you when your an old woman!<br>  <br>  Cheers to you and do what you think is right! I'm sick of people telling me I'm not suppose to do this, or "but what about this tradition?!?! YOU HAVE TO!" No. No I don't! : )|`|AA12116854	I guess you're planning on disregarding the serious sacredness of your marriage vows, huh?|`|ImGwbkGNaa	the walking down the aisle song defiantly not.|`|YQuDq32paa	1. are you 12?<br>  2. are you serious?|`|HcboXOmjaa	Don't support Chris Brown's music!|`|943kNZTtaa	I personally think you should go with something that are more older. theres a lot of great love songs out there.|`|s21NpQGJaa	umm no at weddings ppl dont use music with words---everyone knows that lol|`|6HX4u0SRaa	don't listen to what those 2 just said you can have any song you chose at your wedding|`|RuKK1LYiaa	the first dance song is fine, but the music for the ceremony should be instrumental for the most part but i see no problem in ya'll using the song by the pussycat dolls for the recessional when ya'll are walking back. I'm using Lollipop sung by Framing Hanley for my recessional. Have fun with it, its your day.
wMCwxy2Raa	hey lydia=], well i have those moments and trust me you'll have more of these "emo moods but not a emo girl". I'm not sure actually what it is, maybe it is your body just so stressed out about the pain and crap going on right now, that it just wants to shut down and chill. It may seem harm to get out of it, but do not repeat do not give up. try and do something with friends, if that doesnt make u happy, just have you some you time. do something you love to do or try something you have never done. nothing illegal=] . if u dont have a boyfriend find a best guy friend and hang out.<br>  keep your head up even if it mean tying your hair to the ceiling=p|`|6my2NqzBaa	You might want to go see your DR.

jfsul7ENaa	just do it with her|`|U8oR3VU6aa	She has been with you for 4 years and you want to boink another girl 'cause you think your johnson is too brown? She has been with you for 4 years without any sex, that tells you that she is there to stay. You are making too much out of this. Just tell her it is your first time too. Learn together. What color do you want your stuff to be? You are who you are and there is nothing you can do about it. Why do guys think we want an acrobat in the sack? If a woman loves you she can overlook a lot and what guys think is a turnoff girls think is precious and endearing. Give your girl some credit. And don't screw around on her because you don't have confidence in yourself.|`|aWa5yBeUaa	DON'T DO IT!!!!! ur 1st time should be with the 1 u love. ur girlfriend should be honored that she will be the 1st 1 u make love 2. if u've been 2gether for 4 yrs u be comfortable enough with her 2 discuss body parts and what to expect when clothing becomes optional.|`|ISMyBiU1aa	dont do that jus ask people with experience|`|XCk0IOQIaa	You're asking us if you're worried about your girlfriend. You mean you can't determine whether or not you have a worrisome state-of-mind when it comes to your partner? I suggest you go to a psychotherapist and seek some help.<br>  <br>  If you meant "I'm worried about my girlfriend." WITHOUT the question mark, then fu?k off. This is Yahoo!

You probably meant boyfriend.|`|fYh70EUlaa	You shouldn't worry about doing good or not,'coz there's a lot more things to worry about.Like the place,the time,because there are certain times in the month when it's the best time to do it.And of course you'd need protection!..And no,you should have sex with your girlfriend first.It seem wrong if you lose your virginity to a person you don't love.That's why it's called making love!goodluck and cheers!;)|`|F3LBgfvwaa	noo don't do it with your other friend! your first time is more special, and it's all the more intimate for being a learning experience. if your girlfriend loves you then you should be more comfortable with her.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Sure, break the trust you have built with your girlfriend during the past 4 years by having sex with someone else. Idiot, what an earth made you think this would be a 'good idea'. Cheat on her like that and guess what, you won't have a girlfriend anymore at all. <br>  Just let your relationship with your girlfriend progress naturally, and stop freaking out. If you have been together 4 years and love each other then you don't really have much to worry about.
c3MFIbeUaa	Ah, my friend. First explain that this information changes nothing. Your his sister whether it be half quarter or even an 1/8th.<br>   Also tell him how this information came about and how it affected you.<br>   It had to of because you are somewhat concerned about sharing that information with your brother.<br>   I find that if someone who has nothing to gain by sharing bad information to someone in a caring manner will be less of a negative burden to the young boy.<br>   I think that the news coming from you will be better than him finding out somewhere else and then finding out you knew and kept it from him.<br>   It might lessen his trust in you. Something i would hate to see or even hear about.<br>   You must do this in person and on a close association as he will also see the pain in your face and the emotions that come with this news.<br>   GOOD LUCK in telling him<br>   I do think the sooner the better though. AS all wounds are healed in time and i believe that the healing of wounds ( this one) should start soon. Who knows it may not affect him as it did you as he already knows his wonderful sister loves him and the rest of the family does as well. No matter what blood runs through his veins.|`|PBdPD748aa	i think they both have every right to know about this. they are well beyond the age of when they deserve to know the truth, they aren't children. you are close to them, so of course you can tell them, telling them with your mother would be nice but if you want to say it with just you guys - go for it, at least they didnt get told by the drunk grandfather!<br>  <br>  i would approach it by saying there is something that you think they need to know, maybe do it out somewhere public, like a cafe if you like, so the reaction can be in some way controlled,so no 'in the moment' blows occur, although you may prefer to be at home, thats up to you. just gently explain the truth. you have all been raised as brothers and sisters so it doesnt make a difference. there is no 'sweet' way to tell them, just be as understanding and softly spoken as you can!|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	He is old enough, he will be surprised but will get over it as it won't change anything between the two of you.|`|GmghrL4Iaa	why does it even matter that you tell him?<br>  tell him when he's old enough to understand what half siblings are.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	Leave well alone.  This is not for you to tell.   IF anyone were to tell him,  which really I think he should know.   It ought to come from his mom or his dad.   How come he doesn't know anyway?   No one has talked about a different dad/mom or anything?   <br>  I have two sons,  and they knew early on and that info came from me.<br>  They are close as close can be,  and they never ever refer to the other brother as a half brother or step brother or anything less than a brother.   So what I am saying is,  when your brother comes to this knowledge,   I think you guys will be fine and it won't affect your relationship whatsoever.     You have been his big sister right from the get go.<br>  I really think it will be ok.    Get your mom or dad to tell him,   that is if they are still around.|`|vqEaTmU2aa	My sister and I have a different father than our significantly older sister, and I grew up thinking we were all full siblings. But the way I see it, we all lived in the same house, so it didn't matter. I wouldn't stress it. And wow, that is weird that you had a different mother than you thought... it usually goes the other way around for obvious reasons.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you're not the one who concealed all this information from your brother, so I don't think it's your responsibility to tell him. Your parents should tell him - THEY'RE the ones who have been lying about it all this time.|`|BmXEfdOTaa	My siblings are half as well. <br>  I'm the youngest and I think that I've always known that they had a different parent than me. <br>  <br>  I would tell him that you have one different parent but seriously explain that it doesn't change anything. You still care about him in the same way as before. So what if both of your parents aren't the same?|`|GegQJNzSaa	I had one daughter from my first marriage and 2 from my second. They always knew there were half sisters. I never even thought of hiding it. They all grew up together and don't even think of that part! I wish I knew how to fix this! I can't even conceive how this ever happend.Maybe he already knows and hasn't told you yet! I wouldn't say any thing unless it ever comes up!|`|QilfSBfsaa	Maybe your drunk grandpa was lying or talking nonsense because he was drunk; even it is the truth but your mom and dad have never told you the fact, which means it may not be the truth or they don't want you to know, so why you try to "open a can of worm"?|`|quPY9x7qaa	i don't think I'd tell him and if he ever did find out just be honest, you've never considered him a half brother and still don't.|`|PSkR7EZ3aa	just talk to him,tell him all about it im sure he is old enough to understand. trust me it would be worst if you were not his sister at all. a half isnt so bad|`|fMiLQnSJaa	if your parents didn't tell him, it really is not your job to tell him.|`|sFqsTXvwaa	Why would you even want to tell him that?<br>  <br>  That's understandable. I was just asking. Don't be so defensive. Sheesh.|`|AA10113480	First of all, I'm surprised that your parents haven't told them. Maybe they have very good reasons for not doing so. -Ask them. And, if they don't provide any reason you think is good, and legitimate enough, -and you decide on your own, to inform them, then, be prepared to take responsibility for any firestorms that break out. It could get REALLY ugly. My question is: -why the sudden concern? You stalled on this, for 18, and 16 years, respectively. Maybe your subconscious is trying to tell you, that informing your brothers now would do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  -Just my two-cents-worth. (k.w.)|`|4w9gmvumaa	Why does it even matter?  You are siblings.  Thats all that matters.
469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	First, about the money. The only people responsible for paying for your wedding are the two of you. In fact, I don't think it would be polite even to ask or hint that her family pay for part of it - it's a second wedding, and even the most conservative tradition holds that the bride's parents only pay for the first wedding. (This even if the first wedding was an elopement and they didn't actually pay.) If you can't afford the wedding you want all on your own and if they don't volunteer of their own free will and without being asked (or hinted to) to help out, you'll have to scale your plans down.<br>  <br>  There is one out: if one of the families wants to invite more guests to the reception than you can afford, you can ask that family to pay for those guests. Otherwise it's all on your shoulders and you cannot ask for them to 'kick in' without coming across as greedy and entitled, which I don't think you are.<br>  <br>  You may in perfect taste have a small ceremony and a larger reception later on, as long as the reception is held as soon as possible. This means that in most circumstances the reception should be held within a month of the wedding, but there are exceptions: serious illness, deployment (I noticed your avatar), and a death in the family immediately after the wedding are all valid reasons to delay the reception. Everyone invited to the ceremony must be invited to the reception, but the opposite is not the case.<br>  <br>  If you delay the reception by a few weeks, you can send out a wedding announcement immediately after the ceremony and include in it an invitation to the reception.<br>  <br>  Edit: someone mentioned gift cards above? I don't know if you edited your question or asked another one or if that answerer is answering something you didn't ask, but just in case: it is in the absolute, absolute worst possible taste to tell people what to get you in the wedding invitation or announcement. It makes it seem as if the only reason you're inviting them is to get something from them. It comes across as tacky and greedy.<br>  <br>  Your invitation and/or announcement should have no mention whatsoever of what you want or what you don't want. Tell your families what you would prefer as a gift and let them pass on the message to anyone who asks. Otherwise you get what they give you and you smile and say thank you, whether you want it or not.|`|QFnaCs5saa	Unfortunately, it is not "proper" for her family to pay for a second wedding. Of course, if your families are less traditional and supportive of this binding of families, then you might be surprised what people will offer. Definitely sit down and talk with all the parties involved though. It just depends on your situation and if your families have money to help out right now in our struggling economy. Don't demand anything though, just ask if anyone wants to lend any assistance! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|TJKvoLeBaa	I do not know about the etiquette of it, but I can tell you from experience.  Our wedding is my second and his first.  I have an 11 year old.  We fully expected to fit the bill by ourselves for our smaller (35-40 person, including bridal party) wedding.  No problem with that part of it.  <br>  Anyway, we had hoped that our families would offer to help.  NOPE, not a dime or an hour of help.  My mom and dad have passed, so they are not there to offer.  His family feels since it is my second wedding it is not "acceptable" to even have a wedding.  <br>  I was really shocked when that attitude came out.  I thought they were really nice people, but never once have offered  a bit of help.    <br>  Hopefully yours will be a different story.|`|DC4Civrvaa	I agree with the other answerer.  Don't ask her family to chip in.  It wouldn't be so bad if you asked for gift cards instead of actual gifts.  At least that way you guys could use them for what you need maybe cut back on costs there.  Go ahead and ask your own family, but I would let her family offer if they wanted to.  Congratulations and good luck!|`|ImGwbkGNaa	don't ask her family they already did it once.
6my2NqzBaa	If your having problems now.. you will always have problems let h er go and move on.. X's are x's for a reason|`|wMCwxy2Raa	Okay coming from a girl's perpective. This may bother you but i'm giving you advice. <br>  First of all she is your ex- she should be long gone out of your "love" life and "friend" life. You should move on, it may be tough but the first step is to delete her, get rid of her #, stuff that reminds you of her, and places you went with or done stuff, just remember it wasnt' always like that.<br>  Second she is a girl that loves attention from everywhere and EVERY GUY.<br>  If she has more guy friends then girl friends that means she loves to be looked at and thought about in many ways.<br>  -Your ANOTHER guy she knows will be there if she wanted to feel wanted.<br>  Honestly you can find a better chick, when you do man up and find a real women-she should not wear make-up, or care about what she wears all the time, or goes clubin.<br>  Find a girl who has goals in her life, a girl who is independent not clingy.|`|EGInEfVVaa	I feel like she knows you still care about her enough to drop everything when she calls... and it seems like she's using that against you.<br>  <br>  You have to decide whether or not you're willing to be hurt, because I think she will end up hurting you in the end.
XjJmIQJhaa	no <br>  <br>  that husband loves his wife honors her and respects her, he is a good man and a good husband, and if anything the other husband is a mysoginist|`|F3LBgfvwaa	lol no he's not a traitor! it's a little sad that the first guy is so insecure with his masculinity that he still labels some things as "women" jobs. I would smack my husband if he said that!|`|6b67548da9d1a58e2a0266faba9eac8aaa	No, I'd say he's smart.  He will benefit in oh, so many ways.  The "lazy" husband will lose his retirement in the upcoming divorce (that he surely doesn't know about yet.)
Qk7xiIkNaa	Don't punch him, just try to ignore him or let him think that it doesn't bother you and he may stop.  He probably senses that it is bothering you and that is why he does it.  Just let it roll off your back and don't get upset.
u7Y1SAViaa	What you are experiencing now is the after-love. You miss him, the good part of him and what you guys used to do. It really all depends on you, you can either start over because you still want him or date other people to actually experience a better relationship. Think of all the hott men out there waiting to get to know you. Don't let them down. Haha.
U8oR3VU6aa	Yeah she should get you stuff for Christmas and birthdays and it is thoughtful of you to remember her. I think you are gifting someone who doesn't appreciate it. Next time buy for someone more deserving and appreciative. And if the selfish cheap 'best friend' buys something for you next time. Say thank you, take the present, and smile and don't feel bad or make apologies. Then when the next holiday comes up make a point to ask if you'll ' be exchanging gifts' this year.|`|kfCxfnPEaa	sure. or maybe you should stop giving gifts until she catches on.  why spend your money on someone that is just going to abuse it?|`|5lgBkV0Iaa	when my bday comes or when its my friends bday i dont get them anything i dont care if they think im a ***** or something but i say lets just go out and have fun at a restaurant...and we dont trade presents|`|rCOI8xDaaa	Are u chinese?<br>  <br>  Cheap bastard
1TSMdgG1aa	Think about it, you live together, you work together.  You're spending so much time with each other that the little things that she may have done before (but you didn't notice then) may be bothering you now.  <br>  <br>  Did she always act like this?  Or have you noticed her acting like this lately?  Either way, you need to talk to her about the things that are bothering you.  She may be stressed about something and you may not know it.  Talking it out will help.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|HRiwLWpHaa	exactly what u wrote.. tell her straight out.. communication is better.. sounds gay but its true. i mean i would tell u to go off on her but since u mentioned she lives w u.. then u two should work things out.. tell her u dont like ur attitude. maybe u should try to be like her one day so she can notice how arrogant she is .
Km6QTk9Caa	The story of Lot is slightly different,  she was looking back at a life full of drunkeness and partying and such and wishing she still had it.<br>  <br>  You are not looking back upon anything that was bad or harmful to your life and hankering after it.   You had a special friendship.   Of course it is ok to grieve over a loss of a friendship,  it is natural.    <br>  <br>  I am not a christian but please don't let that put you off my input.<br>  It is ok to have feelings,   you can't just cut those feelings off and dismiss them.   You are not made of stone.   You have a heart that feels and a mind that thinks.<br>  I think there is a time to be sad,  and maybe grieve a little,  but yes to have a healthy approach to it,  not to be sad for long,  it is important to move forward,  have good memories and just accept that life changes.  Friends can come and go sometimes.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	It's okay, in time you're heart will heal and Christ will hold on with you to help mend your heart. Not everyone is perfect. You will get over it soon.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	No. Christians don't "stone". I am one! It's totally ok to miss someone!|`|nGkCWpRVaa	mourning is for the dead when someone moves away you miss them|`|0lQtTE9Daa	why would your religion have anything to do with being sad about a friend moving?<br>  <br>  lot's life looked back at a life of sin.
jjoBO3jkaa	Hey there. I just wanted to let you know that WOW. I am in the exact same situations as you. My mom and sister gang up on me, (even though she secretly totally disagrees with her!)<br>  She used to be bff with my bff's mom, they got into a fight because my moms an alcoholic and they disagreed on everything suddenly and I wasn't allowed to see my best friend for around 6 months. She is a COMPLETE hypocrite! And then my dad is the same as your dad, chill laid back, does what he can to make my home situations better. I'm seventeen, and I don't have a license b/c mom won't let me drive even though I have had a permit. She smokes in the house, so I feel trapped! And she doesn't pay for a DIME of anything for me. I once went to the grocery store with her and her bf (I'm usually not allowed!) and discovered that they spend more money on feeding their addictions (lotto scratch-offs, cigarettes, beer) than food for the family! I feel kind of helpless. I'm sorry this has no organization whatsoever and its probably hard to understand. I just got excited because my bf found your question and thought HEY! sounds like you right? So I just wanted to let you know we are in very similar situations. You should email me sometime. funsizedpixie@yahoo.com|`|LIRbmKbtaa	hi. i believe we have the same mother?|`|UzYlf5mTaa	Your question is what actions you can take to change your mom?<br>  <br>  Nothing. You cannot change another person.<br>  <br>  You can change your response to her actions.<br>  <br>  First, think about what you said. She has full custody and you are 16. You could go to court to ask to be legally emancipated, like you were 18. Check to see what you would have to prove: that you can support yourself, etc. You could make an action plan to get ready to move out as soon as you could.<br>  <br>  You could choose to accept that you, like most people in the world, are not guaranteed anything more than housing and food from a parent. If you could learn to be calm no matter what she does, she would not be able to involve you in her drama.<br>  <br>  You do not have to ignore her. Just don't expect anything from her. <br>  <br>  She's just another flawed human being that happens to be your mother. Her life probably isn't what she wanted either.<br>  <br>  Just work on the next stage in your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
DS21ekeJaa	The rush, the tingles, the perfection of kissing for hours...........yep, I miss it!|`|78U2kCuJaa	no I misses my wife so you and me we are and,same situation, wy? you and me, have some consolation|`|8ae9CGqcaa	I miss it too. For sure. My husband and I rarely have sex anymore, but when we do, it goes straight to the sex. There is no warming up. <br>  <br>  God, what I wouldn't give to just makeout again!|`|2NWseSSaaa	yes yes yes... why doesn't everyone feel that way!|`|Ga9oCLavaa	Yes....I miss it alot|`|kHRD7uUAaa	yea i still do where do you live?
71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	It amazes me the number of people that feel the same way you do. Here is all you really need to know. Just becasue someone doesn't show you that they miss you doesn't mean that they don't. Your exfriend could miss you as much as you miss them. But neither of you want to be the one to break down and admit it.<br>  <br>  So instead of working the problem out and get back to being friends you play this game. If your friend really means that much to you then stop f'in around and talk to them. If they don;t feel the same way, they weren;t your friend to begin with, so move on.<br>  <br>  If they do feel the same way you got your friend back.<br>  <br>  Jeez, its not rocket science. Either way you know where you and your friend stand and you can qiut worrying about it and move on with your life.|`|bQTFX54waa	man I wish I knew<br>  if I did I would tell you<br>  cause I'm in the same positions you right now
4POGapREaa	That's not odd.  My DJ offered to arrange that & my officiant said he would arrange it if the DJ couldn't.  I've only been to 3 weddings but the one they did the sand ceremony at just had audio.  I never questioned it.  Never thought it was or wasn't odd until you asked this.
SOd54uTkaa	I would deny that it's true, then curse her out when you are in private, then cut her off. True friends don't do that. Also, make sure you have some dirt on her to threaten incase she wants to spread news again.|`|P6gFd9Tkaa	Wow Um <br>  I would be really ticked of if i were you let ur "friend" know how you feel tell her and not "nicely" well if you are not really bothered by it which i doubt then you can be easy on her but if you are mad then don't tell her and let her know that if it happenes in the future you will never wanna see her again probably and again if you are nt bothered by it then let her or tell her easily also if your'e not gonna go easy on her then LET HER KNOW HOW YOU FEEL YELL IF YOU WANT! I know I would!|`|XJ6RxMQIaa	this is why they invented the bitc* slap. For girls like that. If I were you, I'd embarass her EVERY time she goes into public places. (my friend always tells me "shut up your not funny! Go away!" in public places, and its really embarassing, but now, everyone does it to her :)|`|AA11528411	That's really mess up. Why would she want to embarrass you in front of the people? If it was me, I would start avoiding her because I am not a confrontational person.|`|gHCSkzkRaa	ya she's probably a jealous b!tch, but I would be more likely to just call her jealous b!tch, and not just go on cursing and cursing|`|AA11299079	thats f--ked up....  yea, the friendship would be in jeapordy.|`|90qBWGmJaa	I would flip out.|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	Ditch that *****!  Who needs enemies with friends like that.|`|eFeRODh3aa	I would be angry<br>  But I wouldn't curse her out or cut her off. She is probably just jealous that you met someone new that maybe she wanted or whatnot.<br>  I would just tell her that it was NOT cool, and that you were really offended and ask her why she did it..|`|rgCWPPLmaa	Your friend is a jerk, but really, is it going to matter in 10 years?

Good luckk =D|`|AA12323302	I would curse her out thoroughly and not tell her ANYTHING else.  That's so personal and to just be announcing it on a public bus in from of total strangers is not cool!  I don't know if I'd cut her off immediately but yeah, definitely tell her about herself.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Oh my gawd. I would smack her and tell her to shut her trap. Then i would spill one of her secrets. Then again, it is pretty childish.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yes. wow what a loud mouth. actually my friend did this when I was cheating. she must want something you have or is jealous of you and thus, puts you down in front of others.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	Yeah, I probably would. That's a really mean thing to do.
tCsFxh5Aaa	Each state is different, so you'd be better off asking someone who works in the foster care system in California.  But usually, they are very protective of those who were in foster care and don't want to release any information without a court order, as they can't be sure about your motives for wanting to contact the person.<br>  <br>  You might want to do an online search.  I know that there are online groups that try to help match up people who were adopted with their biological families.  There may be similar groups for those from foster care.  It may be a matter of putting out, on such a group, the information of the person that you are looking for and then waiting to see if that person comes looking for you.|`|6b0183be8b59d389afaeae26f5356580aa	The records are locked and only a judge can order them to be unlock but you would have to prove to a judge that they need unlocked for a medical reason so even then you wont find out nothing.The judge looks at the records,not you.
XjJmIQJhaa	I happen to like white men over black men.  And I wish there was a magic wand that could make me white too.

Absolutely nothing.<br>  <br>  Its society that wants you to be with your own kind.  You might think that their is something wrong with you, but in all actuality there is nothing wrong with you.  You are just unique!!!<br>  <br>  Society (at present) says that you are supposed to be with your own kind, and most of society conforms to it and does not question it<br>  <br>  But just because society accepts that as normal does not mean that you have to obey, you the individual can chose to be different <br>  <br>  And it will make you happy!!!<br>  <br>  So you are given a choice:<br>  <br>  A.) Listen to society and conform and not be happy<br>  or<br>  B.) Listen to your heart and live happily<br>  <br>  option A is harder for the outside world of conformists to accept but you will be happy and that's what matters!! <br>  <br>  The only thing I can suggest is possibly moving to an area dense with Latin men whom you are attracted to<br>  <br>  and also to go on interaccial dating sites because I guarantee that there is a latin guy out there who feels the same way about white women|`|go56LYJvaa	give it time and Mr. Right will come along, maybe not a Latino, maybe just the good guy for you!

Maybe you should try and keep an open mind, and maybe consider a relationship with non-Latino guys? This is just my take on it.<br>  <br>  But most of all, please, PLEASE don't tell yourself that there is no one out there for you. There is someone out there for everyone - it's only the search for it that's difficult (heck, I haven't even started looking for that person yet). You don't need some kind of spell to make you Latin in order to find the person, you just find them. And they will love you for who you are.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	look for someone with qualities that you admire not just what they look like, do things for yourself and give your self some time out join a sporting club or find a hobby that you have interests in then you may find someone there who wants to be with you for the way you are. <br>  You should never feel like you have to change for someone elses benefit.|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	I've always had an affinity for asian women. My longest relation was with a japanese woman. And now I'm seeing a Malaysian. The difference between them are like night and day. The latino population is huge, and to generalize is easy, it's to find the one for you that is difficult. But if you give up the search before you find him, you will end up lonely. There is a reason why you like latinos. Don't let a few setbacks break your courage and curiosity. You are still young and have lots of chances to find a good man! Don't have to stress about it, just go on living your life and one day he will stand right in front of you.

You'd be surprised at what pop culture teaches them these days.<br>  <br>  If that's the case, and they know more than you expected them to, you're done with what is usually the hard part. So you can just encourage them to ask you questions and that will answer the rest of their questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|woEoXfaZaa	At 13 I would be really suprised if they didn't already know all about it (if not already experienced some of it)<br>  <br>  I don't think it should be "a talk" but more of an openness - expressing to them that no matter what they should always feel like they can ask you any questions that they have about sex.  Let them know that nothing they say to you will ever get them in trouble and that you will help them anyway you can.  If they are girls ask if they would like to go to the doctor to get contraception - that way you will know what stage they are up too.<br>  <br>  Good luck....|`|qo2u1BCoaa	I think that you should talk to each child individually and privately from the others. Advise them ahead of time that next Sunday at x o'clock that you would like to talk with them about the Birds and the Bees and will answer any and all questions. Respond to what they ask.They know more than you think. Most likely they do not know about pre-*** viability or very much at all about STD's.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Planned Parenthood has an excellent course that you and your children can attend together. That way, they get the whole truth from a technical standpoint from an impartial source, and you can discuss things on the way home.|`|uXOhQidGaa	If you're doing it right, they do not require "the talk" because you've been age-appropriately open and honest with them about sex from the moment they were born.
Exv4AjqCaa	Everyone saying your parents are selfish are most likely children themselves.<br>  <br>  Your parents are probably trying not to spoil you so that you do not take money for granted. So that you realise it has worth & that it is not easy to come by.<br>  <br>  Why do you think you get celebrities who end up bankrupt ? They spend spend spend & have no idea how to budget....or how hard it is to actually get these items in the real world.<br>  <br>  You may have friends now who get all the little items they want, but i promise you that mentally right now your parents are giving you a much much much better understanding of how to handle money. Simply from the fact that you're having to work to get what you want.<br>  <br>  For your brother they probably want him to advance in sports & so they're spending more money on that end of things. Again its in the hope that HE crafts his own career.<br>  <br>  Its tough at your age to have any idea of how this is beneficial to you atall & instead consider it simply unfair. But its doing you a lot of good.|`|AA10895669	Sarah, first lets start by saying, I had a lot less then you do when I was growing up. You have a roof over your head, a bed to sleep in of your own, food in your belly and clothes on your back. There are many right here in this country who have far less, and that includes not having any parents.<br>  <br>  Now, as you discribe it, it certainly sounds unfair. And if your parents are saying they'd rather have something else besides you, that is very wrong (I'd tell them to their face about that if I were there.) But, I'm sure you go with them when they go out to dinner, I never went out to dinner, a special meal for me was when mom brought home a box of Kentucky fried chicken. And I bet you go with them in the RV, And I bet you use the home electronics, BTW what are you typing to Answers on?<br>  <br>  You may not like it, and yes it would be wonderful to go shopping for things just for you that you want. (If I were close, I'd take you shopping, just because that would be fun and I'm sure you desirve a little fun.) But what you don't get, is that you are learning to be responcible resilliant and resourceful. Somethings many of your peers won't understand until much later in life and after hard money issues when they are finnally on their own. If you want things for yourself. Get a better job, or baby sit more. But better, do your best and more in school (I'll bet your parents are saving for your colllege, have you discussed this with them, you should)  The more education you get the better your life will be, and then you will be able to get and give the things that you want, when you want.<br>  <br>  enjoy your life. It could be so much worse!!!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You can get a job and work for what you want. <br>  You are going to be a self-made, independent person.<br>  Actually, the writing is on the wall and you have 2 years to work and save so you can launch out of there after you graduate at 18. <br>  When you finally leave them behind, you don't have to worry about them ever again. <br>  Of course, they really should be nice to you... you will be picking out their nursing home.|`|fMiLQnSJaa	At least you must live in a nice house.

Just make sure they send you to college so you can get a good paying position when you graduate.  Walmart clothes are not that bad.  If you look around long enough you can find some cute things.  Find how to mix your Colors.  Like get a hot pink tank and an aqua print shirt to ware over it where some of the hot pink will show and just a plane pair of jeans or a skirt.  Buy some cheep white ked tennis shoes and some permanent markers and stencils and make designs on your shoes.  Do anything to be different but yet let people know that you are cool and creative.  You don't have to look like walmart just because you buy your clothes there.   Just use some imagination and you can look darling.  Ware a smile that is the best dress you have.  Don't worry about what the other girls are waring!|`|XjJmIQJhaa	woah your a lucky girl my parents make less than $8000 dollars a year (and no I did not leave out any zeros!!!)

They could secretly be putting money away for you in a trust fund or something<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should be less materialistic<br>  <br>  And yeah if they make over 250k a year and there is hardly any food in the house then somebody needs to be slapped!!!<br>  <br>  If I were you I would be spending my money on hypnotism books and tapes so that I could get my parents to see things my way!!!<br>  <br>  by the way what do your parents do???<br>  <br>  and to the person above me she will rely on her parents if she plans on going to college, her parents will have to pay for it because of their income and if they refuse she wont be able to receive financial grants and or loans unless she either successfully emancipates herself or turns 24!|`|vLAakLfjaa	wow.....your parents are really ... selfish ... sorry ... well you could try to make them answer your question .... like...."why do i have to shop at goodwill" or " when do i get a new bed" (or whatever you want)....don't say "can?" or "will?" because that bounds them to say "no" but put questions in a way that makes them answer with a sentence...which will probably take you further than "no" <br>  also you can try putting them into an uncomfortable situations in from of their friends for example when you hear a conversation like "we bough this....at this place ...blah blah blah" from your parent's friends....... say something like...."really??? my parents make me shop at goodwill and get secondhand furniture" that should do it.... <br>  <br>  hope you get your problem resolved....read mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309220129AA5KyR8&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  ComWiz

You need to decide if you really want him in your life any longer,and he needs to decide if he wants you in his life anymore.<br>   You need to have an honest and truthful talk with each other,and you need to make some decisions on what each of you really wants, There is no beating around the bush on this one.<br>  No matter how hard the decisions,they have to be made so both of you can go on with your lives,either together or apart.

T3b4I4kXaa	Your husband is living in never-never land if he thinks he can turn a blind eye to the kid without addressing the problems. If he is this bad at 13, imagine what he will be like in a couple more years... we're talking drugs, alcohol, and getting in trouble with the law. He will be spending thousands on rehab and lawyers before you know it.<br>  <br>  It is really up to his dad to lay down the law. Everyone has to go to school. Everyone has chores. Everyone has to pick up after themselves. It is far easier to just do these few simple things instead of fighting them. This kid is choosing the hard way all the way.<br>  <br>  You would be doing yourself a big favor by not allowing these two to make you miserable. You certainly don't want to make any children with this man because you will definitely be left on your own. Time to cut your losses.|`|XjJmIQJhaa	Realize that this child is offspring of the man you married, if your husband is not willing to correct his son's disgusting behavior for the sake of his wife then he is not a good father nor a good husband, and you better make sure you let him know that he is not<br>  <br>  you should seek help from family counselors and ask them what you should do for a stepson who was a crackbaby|`|6lYwWb5eaa	Let him know the situation with his mom.

fd76fcf7d987df9779f858fbf3501206aa	I have been in the same situation as you.  My bf broke up with me (I was 20 years old at the time), and I cried and what not.  But then I started acting like I didn't care.  And then he started IMing me 2 weeks later and  then "accidentally" bumped into me at church 2 weeks after that.  And then we got back together.  I am not with him today, but after we got back together, we were together for another 5-6 years.<br>  <br>  So overall, my advice is act like you don't care.  If you return to her right away, she'll probably push you away again and know that she can call you up anytime and walk all over you.   Don't respond to her texts.  If she really wants to be with you, she'll find you.  And when she finally asks "Why haven't you been responding to my texts?"  Just say "oh I thought you wanted to take a break" and then look all sad and sympathetic.  She'll come back then.|`|wAWFTvofaa	a break lol yeah sure its another saying of we should f u c k someone else u should do the same thing|`|dsQXmqsFaa	Pedo|`|wMCwxy2Raa	When a person takes a break it can mean a few things:<br>  -She is unsure if she wants to commit to you(because she is scared or because you do something to give her doubts-including behavior, insecuritys,etc.)<br>  -She has another prince charming in mind<br>  -Her parents dont approve the relationship and she doesnt want to make a big scene.<br>  well what ever the reason is, you should be worried. if you've been with her for weeks/months this is fatal. the relationship is not going to last.<br>  but if you have been with her for years, its even more fatal. she is getting tired of the love you guys share, maybe its not enough or its just too much for her.<br>  Dont let the break be more than a week, if u do its over between u and her.
V5gELuFOaa	go to the state tourney. it may be a once in a lifetime experience and you will regret it if you do not go. I am sure you can do something for that class later to make it up to the teacher. Maybe even if you turn in a written copy of your speech so someone else could at least read it to make the "mock trial" happen.|`|4w9gmvumaa	Explain the situation to your teacher and ask if you could reschedule it.  If that does not work, have your coach talk to her for you, explaining that the championships are a big deal and that you are the manager.  You have to learn to utulize your coaches as allys and they can reason with the fellow teachers better as an adult.  He might even get you an alternative assignment to do instead.  I always excused my students when they had sports related commitments and helped them make arrangements for missed work.|`|9RuBwanoaa	ask her to do you a big favor. explain your situation.<br>  <br>  but regardless of what happens id go to the sports deal. youll regret not going later.|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	Get a replacement instead of your part for the mock trial and go enjoy the state tourney! Mock trial is fun, but less fun than the state trouney. The state tourney will be an irreplacable event and the mock trial is really just another mock trial. You can get any of your classmates to hop in for you as the "key vitness" Bribe them!|`|66Fhsm0vaa	just explain the situation to your teacher and ask if there's any way you could re-schedule for a different day b/c the tournaments really important to you but so is your grade|`|d9f63360c00901d3fe28d35b4e974c71aa	Stay away from Deli sandwiches. LOL|`|HE56Jra6aa	Go to your Speech Teacher and explain about the trip... She just may let you off the hook.  Be Honest..|`|tbESsT2daa	In my opinion is just one class assignment. You can make up for it when you come back on the Monday, or decide an alternative with your teacher.<br>  <br>  If your groupmate cared at all about her grade she wouldn't miss the class and would fill in for you both. If she doesn't you shouldn't. Don't make a decision to miss the tourney just because a "really bitchy" girl will be pissed. Let her be pissed, w.e Try talking to her first, and explain that you're going to the tourney, if she wants to do the presentation she can, if not, you'll do another assignment individually and she can fail the class debate :)<br>  <br>  The tourney sounds like a lot of fun, one of your teachers has been okay with you leaving to go, I'm sure your ACS teacher will be reasonable to negotiate an alternative assignment for you to make up.<br>  <br>  Go to the tourney! Good luck :)
AA11286455	If it happened once in a great while, I wouldn't say anything or think it inappropriate, esp. if you're teens or even pre-teens.  <br>  <br>  If it's happening repeatedly or along with other behaviors (acting goofy), then no matter the age, it's gone over a line and is inappropriate and needs to end.  <br>  <br>  From your post, you don't sound anything like a "jealous guy" at all, so it may be time to stand up and say something.  <br>  <br>  You can start the conversation with your friend or your girlfriend, though I'd recommend starting with her.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you use a lot of *I* statements:  <br>  <br>  --Whenever the three of us are together, I see you abc...xzy.  What does that mean?<br>  <br>  ----When you act like that when he's around, I wonder if I'm not giving you enough attention?  Is that what's going on?  If so, I need you to TALK/TELL me so I can hold up MY end of this relationship.  <br>  <br>  --I feel disrespected, ignored, and/or neglected when I see you and him abc..xyz.  Wha'ts going on?   <br>  <br>  --When you tickle him and act goofy like that, It reminds me of when we first started dating.  <br>  <br>  It certainly seems to me that this is "flirting behavior" and I don't understand why.  <br>  <br>  Should I look for a new gf?  (Don't ask this last question if you even THINK you're not going to like the answer!!!  The idea is to have an open, mature, and honest conversation without being threatening and killing the communication.)  <br>  <br>  Also, don't forget when you ask a question:  Stop talking.  Listen for the answer--listen for HER answer.  Watch for her reaction.  Then you two can decide on where you go from there.  <br>  <br>  Everyone has a right to their feelings and their observations--even if they're totally off the wall.  Congratulations, as you sound honestly objective and it is so hard to be under such circumstances.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	If it makes you uncomfortable, say something to her about  it but as long as they're not kissing and going places alone it's kinda innocent horseplay.|`|xhDdYnHTaa	It all sounds pretty innocent to me, but if it makes you really uncomfortable just tell her.  If she really cares about your feelings, she'll stop doing it.  Tell her if she's in the mood to tickle, she should tickle you!|`|WA9Y8QAEaa	well tell her how you feel, she can't know unless you tell her :) I'm sure she'll understand if you just open up to her :) <br>  good luck!|`|XJ6RxMQIaa	She is Just messin around, don't worry :)|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Tickle her friends... or just ignore it and live life.

IPS3hWweaa	No, she's just being your mom and doing the things that she feels are best for you. Don't hate her because of something she did, I can guarantee you that she only hates some of the things you do, but she'll never hate you. You should be the same.|`|fwLW0cUQaa	i dont hate my mom, i get extremely mad at her sometimes and cant stand her but i still love her|`|XjJmIQJhaa	it depends on if your mother loves you or not<br>  <br>  My mother is very jealous of me becuase I am doing well in school and I'm not interested in men right now<br>  <br>  My mother never became any of the things she wanted to be in life and is very jealous of me and is very mean to mean and lashes out at me and insults me everday and it really hurts me emotionally and I'm crying right now really heavily because mother's or not supposed to treat their daughters cruelly <br>  <br>  And yes she was abused as a child in ways I cant imagine but that still is no justification for her behavior<br>  <br>  So yes I guess I do hate my mother for that becuase dialy she wishes for bad things to happen to be physically and sexually because they happened to her and I think that that is a great reason to hate one's mother!!!|`|zCXRxuSGaa	Imagine if you lost her.

Why do you (think you) hate your mother? What has she done, to offend you so deeply? -She went through a lot of pain, to bring you into this world. She (and your father) fed, clothed and sheltered you, all these years. Was it just so (they) could be re-paid with (this)? You say she's "mean". Well, what do you mean, by "mean"? You have to be more specific. Is she refusing to give you money, to buy "stuff" she knows you'd be better-off without? -Is she telling you she doesn't want you seeing "that boy", -because (she knows) he's not good enough for her precious daughter? When you tell the world (here) that you hate your mom, aren't YOU being mean? -Sounds like you need to do more soul-searching, and less web-surfing.

Try to be friends with everybody.<br>  <br>  You are at a weird age where everyone is awkward.

Your priorities don't sound the same as hers. Why does it matter what she thinks? She probably won't stop being racist, she has her own opinion on things like this. Just go for it.

Without your permission, none can hurt you.  Let your ex husband look at your new found job, high salary and the confident lifestyle of yours and feel guilty.  <br>  <br>  No relationship is worth where there is no mutual respect, honesty. So you did the right thing.  Develop positive thinking, concentrate on your life, look forward in forging new relationships and enjoy life in spite of all the problems that you may have to face.  When you make love with problems and look for the hidden opportunities behind them, none can snatch the happiness from you.<br>  <br>  Wish you all the very best and good day.|`|HMfg13gaaa	I think it is time for you to move on.

That was the greatest moments when we spent lots of time playing around etc.  In fact, we have been together since his birth and he is now 30 years.  We still enjoy a close relationship.  I distinctly remember all the moments, right from his first day in school, the day of admission, his visit to Zoo with school children (without parents).  <br>  <br>  My story telling, imaginary stories,going to native place in train, bus etc are all memorable.|`|AA10961538	1970s that was the best time of my life I was young and anything went back in the 70's|`|8ae9CGqcaa	Honestly, it would be the moment my son was borne.<br>  I was so tired and out of it, I don't think I savoured it as well as I could have.|`|ckUBvd2kaa	I would re-live the first sexual experience and hope it would last longer.

I would only want to go back if I could take the wisdom I have today with me though. Why? Because I have too much drama in my life sometimes and I would make very sure the second time around that I didn't get involved with people who would be a bad choice for me. Also I would have gotten saved (born again) at that age and lived to serve the Lord so I would not make bad choices in life.

rHuAhN3iaa	You've been together for eight years, I think you probably know your fiance inside and out by now, so to say you should move in with him because you might find something out that you don't know about him is faulty reasoning.<br>  <br>  I think that it certainly isn't a silly thing to wish for, and I almost feel that since you've waited this long why not wait til you are married! If it's important to you then you definitely should wait.<br>  <br>  But if you do decide to move in, just make sure you know each other's patterns, and pet peeves. I am the type to leave dishes in the sink for a day or two but it's my fiance's pet peeve so I have stopped doing it. Little things to make sure you know.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, we're getting married June 2010 too and been together for six year by then. I think we would have waited had I not gotten pregnant. Kinda changes everything but I digress.<br>  <br>  You'll make the right decision whatever you decide.|`|AA10018260	Well this is how I think of it.  It is nice for it to be special after the wedding but now a days it is a good way to find out about your spouses habits BEFORE the wedding.  There are things I would not have figured out about my fiancee if I did not live with him.  I think it is good to live with your fiancee before marrying him jsut to be sure he is the one.  You are supposed to only get married once so you want to be sure you are makng the right decision.  But YOU and HIM are the only ones who can make this decision.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	I say move in.  It won't effect how "special" the marriage is.  I live with my fiance, and I have learned his likes/dislikes. Just stick to the wedding date and don't change it.  I refuse to be one of those that are together, living together for a decade and don't get married.|`|AA11299079	Wow!

I think our marriage will be all the more special and exciting if we start living together once married. I have always looked forward for that time in our lives and I don't want to miss it. I want our honeymoon period to be new and exciting. I say wait.|`|nR5ZJQRiaa	Awwe... Congratulations guys! My advise would be move in now... and get used to living with your man, because, although your wedding is the best day of your life, it can also be stressful. Moving in together after can just add to the changes and may become overwhelming for one of you. My advise would be to do it now. And congratulations again!|`|Q3Hh1aiEaa	You can do a trial run and stay over his house for a month if your that unsure. Eight years is a long time so you guys should move in with each other before you get married. I understand both aspects. Talk it over with your fiance and see what his thoughts are. Good luck with everything! and Congrats!|`|ImGwbkGNaa	i say move in... not to rain on the wonderful marriage parade but what if you wait and you move in after the wedding and then you realize you hate each other and are not able to live together?<br>  you will be in divorce city. so test the waters before you jump in<br>  this is 2009 not 1950|`|Hfp80ylEaa	Move in before marriage.  You get to know a person's little habits and how well they compromise on chores and how well they respect your space.  These are things that are good to know before marriage.|`|i4QPLfEVaa	Don't wait till you are married to move in together. You might find something out about him that's a deal breaker. You need to get use to living together first.|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	Move in now :)<br>  Get used to living with him.<br>  Best wishes to both of you <3|`|J7EWQHYJaa	Wow... 13.. to 21.... that's amazing!!<br>  Do what your heart tells you. It should work out pretty well either way :)|`|52c34c700fb8026a167472bd5bdf8d00aa	My ex-husband and I waited until we got married to move in together.<br>  <br>  Notice I said ex-husband.<br>  <br>  Everything seems to come to light when you live with someone. We were together several years before we got married, and because we were "hardcore Christians" we wanted to do it right.<br>  <br>  Unless you have religious parents who are forbidding it, I would go ahead and move in together. You don't want to make a mistake and find out living with him is something you can't bear.|`|lA6lk50Qaa	You have held out this long, another year should be a breeze! I'm sure it will be very special after waiting so long.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes|`|AA11371251	move in together you probably know each other pretty well considering how young you started out but there still are somethings you both will learn after moving in together. My sister was with her ex husband for 7 years and they started dating at 14 and got married secretly at 18 and moved in and everything changed he became over controlling and addicted to porn and a lot of other things and they just got divorced not saying that everything you will find out will be negative or that there will be anything at all but I HIGHLY recommend living together first. Me and my husband did and so nothing came as a surprise once we were married|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	I would say move in together but keep finances separate.  This would be a good time to really see if marriage is the right path for the two of you.
AA12140689	A lot of people are skeptical of self-diagnosis, because it's so often incorrect. There is a more complicated process behind diagnosis than just reading the symptoms and checking if you have them. Things like the severity of the symptoms and how it affects your life are really important factors when a diagnosis is being made. Other conditions must also be excluded. So it's always best to see a doctor to have the diagnosis confirmed, even if you're pretty sure your self-diagnosis is correct.<br>  <br>  Some people are also just really ignorant about Asperger's syndrome and don't understand that the severity varies between individuals. They may think you'd have to be much less functional in order to have it.<br>  <br>  In any case, if your friends are not treating you well then they are not real friends.<br>  <br>  How important is it to you that your friends believe your self-diagnosis? Will it change they way they treat you? Will it solve some problems for you?<br>  <br>  There may be some organizations in your area that could help you get a professional diagnosis, if you think that will help you a lot.|`|361dd3949c69e539c3ee64de86ebc3a3aa	Michael P-<br>  You can't blame your friends for being skeptical of your self-diagnosis.  Would you take a layman serious who offered to represent you in court?  Probably not...<br>  Diagnosis are not as simple as a list of symptoms.  In fact, many doctors are frustrated with patients who go on web md and self-diagnose themselves and think they are as competent than professionally trained doctors. Doctors, mental health and otherwise, spend a tremendous amount of time in school and practicing to even become licensed and capable of diagnosing patients with an illness.  <br>  I"m assuming you do not have a medical degree, but I don't think you're capable of without a doubt diagnosing yourself.  Even doctors have to get second opinions from other professionals, so I think you at least need that.  I do believe that you know yourself best and may be your best self-observer...so your input is invaluable to doctors so you can assist them with their treatment of you.  But again, you are not a doctor.  So don't take it out on your friends for not believing you.  They are just reacting how most people would!<br>  <br>  And to note, when it comes to Asperger's and other similar syndromes, it is usually other people (friends, family, classmates, co-workers) who can best observe the symptoms.|`|XCrkjoQQaa	i strongly believe i don't have the right to judge myself. only the Almighty God can judge people if and only if you believe in the living God in the Holy Scriptures. if you ask me how can we go on in this life without judging. you don't judge you make analysis, then observe then you decide based on how you discern the analysis and observation then base on your decision you act but certain adjustments can be made along the way to suit the situation. this is the worldly way. but if you have the time and chance to inquire from the word and teachings of God in the Holy Scriptures you will find it easier and enlightening for you to decide and act accordingly. good day to you!|`|ULkqriEhaa	Well as a psychology student, there's a rule of thumb NEVER SELF-DIAGNOSE. Even if you have symptoms doesn't mean you 100% have something, when you get enough money to see the doc, go make sure. Before you think you have something. You may or may not, i am not saying anything b/c i don't know you, but a doctor is the best bet.<br>  <br>  I think you should get new friends - they obviously aren't acting like friends to you!!|`|SZvJVM2yaa	if you live in the USA you go to your county hospital health service agency you ask to see if they have MIA or something similar to that it stands for Medical Indigent Adult they will give you free health care all you have to do is show proof of income and  bank accounts  i had to do that several times but they should be able to help n take care of you|`|AUuUl8GOaa	You do not have the college degree to tell people you have this. You really do have no clue what you're talking about and I'm favoring your friends right now.|`|A1rfDaANaa	hey im sorry that you have asperger's syndrome but if your friends dont belive you and respect you they are'nt really ur friends cuz tru friends would respect you and belive you tell them that you dont like them that you want them to be better friends and belive you and to stop treating you the way they are and tell them how you feel.|`|g9AAUkraaa	AD HD maybe but asperger's? Really? The mere fact that you are able to discuss and self diagnose go against your original diagnosis. If by chance you are suffering from it, first look into state help; they might have a program like medicaid or discounted medical. Then get yourself a lottery ticket. Because you have to play the odds if you have asperger's and are diagnosing it. Honestly what makes you come to that conclusion anyway? You have friends so you obviously do not lack social skills. And you are not too clumsy to type. Also...look online and check again. You don't have it dude.|`|mh17M1B1aa	Why would you want to have Asperger's Syndrome, it is a terrible illness that prevents you from coping with society, and you need a phsycologist to diagnose you.|`|69Jcu8Ufaa	Welllll if you really do have asperger's then you're going to have to get it treated it right?  So wouldn't you need to go to a doctor anyways, and he/she could confirm it for you?|`|ju4holjiaa	You're not a doctor. You can't diagnose.|`|sFqsTXvwaa	ROTFL! You can't diagnose yourself.

I'm not saying this to hurt you, or to be mean but to stop this cycle of unhealthy behavior.<br>  <br>  Or something along those lines, you get my drift.<br>  <br>  You can't live your friends life for them, but you don't have to put yourself in the middle of their problems either to be a good friend to them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, they just need a kick in the pants to get them to see what they missed before.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wphI41wNaa	Yes she is next time he comes over go and tell them they have their own house to fool around in yours is not just a place to have sex at then ask her right in front of him if she still loves him and if she says yes then tell her to pack her things because she has over stayed her welcome and is now being disrespectful . Then tell her to quit using you like that it's not right.|`|aWa5yBeUaa	i've been wondering the best answer 2 this question 4 a long time now. the best answer i've given myself is 2 let her know how i, u, feel and let her know how much it bothers u. if  she wants to live a drama filled life, don't drag u, ur husband, or ur kids (if u have any) into it
pdIWs1qgaa	You may as well get used to it. Being gay gets you a stronger hate than being a different race or gender. There's nothing you can do to change people's minds.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, parents don't control the childs lives. Soon, they'll have no say in her life at all. Do as you please, by all means.
iOv9tbULaa	In an ideal world, we'd probably have sex the first day. LOL But, realistically you should get to know the person, to see if you can trust them in an initimate way. It's different for each relationship you're in. There is no real one way or time to do things in a relationship. When you're comfortable, and when you've both gone to take your AIDS and STDS tests and found out that both of you are clean, maybe then you can see what the deal is. DO NOT trsut people even that you do know. Because they may look normal but you go ahead and get them tested before you do anything. Go with them. No need of risking your health. <br>  <br>  And if you have alot to live for....You would be wise who you even lay sown with. If he's not someone who you'd want to pass his genes down to your kids, dont sleep with him. When you have sex everytime is possiblity of making a baby with someone. And what if he has bad genes or something? LOL <br>  <br>  I am very picky with guys. I am very healthy, though. And I have alot to live for.|`|sTFiWuYLaa	entirely depends on the situation.  The first time I had sex with the person I am with (whom I consider the love of my life), we made love the first time that we were alone after she professed that she was into me, and I certainly was into her.  This was completely out of both of our natures, and was even in our best friends bed where we went to "talk" about what to do about our feelings.  Another person I was seeing a year earlier -- took two months.  Seemed kind of unnatural, we never were grooving in that aspect even though we had fun when we were together.<br>  <br>  Gotta feel it out, if that connection and attraction is strong and hot, and you are into the person, than obviously you will move faster.|`|Zuqyx4tJaa	personally, i'm waiting for marriage. but for other people, i think you should wait until you're in a committed, exclusive relationship that will either end in marriage of at least being together for the rest of your lives.|`|NdwjkeNwaa	For me, in the beginning, 6 months.

That's just me though.|`|baW9u4yLaa	When you're both comfortable with the idea....|`|m2eHPeciaa	there's really no answer i can give u. b/c some guys are jerks n will only be ur man to have sex with u, n others that will wait. soo, it depends on the guy.|`|MprOeoI4aa	today!!!!!!!!!!!

iOmw62diaa	It's now or never. If you're not going her now, then don't expect to ask her ever. Just go for it and if she doesn't want to be your friend after that, then screw her. Don't be a coward and regret this for the rest of your life.|`|Yl9741EZaa	I'd say go for it!<br>  If shes the kind of girl you can tell anything to and she will be okay with it then she will accept you and listen to what you have to say even if you don't like the answers.<br>  <br>  You dont have to ask her out just let her know you like her. I think thats how it should be taken. If she goes to say otherwise like 'oh but i just want to be friends..' stop her. Because it wasn't a  queston.<br>  <br>  At least that way you get it off your chest and if she didn't see you like that before then she most probably will now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course thats the worst case scinario. She could have like you for ages too!<br>  And its heaps adorable when guys ask girls. **,<br>  <br>  DOOOOO IIIIIT!<br>  xx|`|QuIe0Feraa	i think if u truly love her then go for it ask your self if its worth risking if u r too scared to tlk to her then u could write her a letter explaining your feelings 4 her

If you don't like the way you're living now, try having to move back with your parents.<br>  <br>  If you're lucky, this is only temporary, but because you have such a horrible attitude about it, I hope its permanent for you. Good luck enjoying the poor life.|`|FSVGnFkdaa	you must be Fuggin shettin me! Are you kidding? Who the hell do yout hink you are? I mean, what kinda crap is this. Holy mack...some people dont even have a home, food, clothing, a car, money, etc. while your complaining about your 2 cars and 3 bedroom house...GET A JOB! Makes me sick to see people like this...I work full time, I am a mother of 2 children. I have a 2 bedroom house and 2 cars with my husband which I am fine and happy with...Both my husband and I work and we are managing life... If you wanna complain so much then get a job...This is so pathetic|`|6oMpHXSiaa	You sound like a real lazy women. What do you do? Did you think that you can get a job? Two incomes is better then one.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You poor, poor, spoiled baby!  You have no idea what it is like to be poor!  Wait until you lose that house and having to rent an apartment with bill collectors hounding you. Try living on food stamps.<br>  <br>  Get out there and get a job... you are going to be doing so anyway. If you work your man into the ground trying to keep you in luxury, he will be divorcing you soon enough. <br>  <br>  Your kids will learn things in public schools that they would never learn in private schools. My dad was a doctor and made sure we went to public schools because of the real world training they provided.<br>  <br>  Tough times never last, but tough people do. Suck it up and adapt!
XmJZkFuMaa	Arm yourself with knowledge.  Find books about conflict management (interpersonal communication is what it's officially called and you can find great books about it), negotiating (How to Get to Yes is a good book), and books about the development of teenagers.  Your library is a great resource.  Even some internet sources can help.  Honestly, the more tools you have, the more problems you can fix when she throws them at you.  <br>  <br>  I'm including a link to the frontline show about teenage brains.  Their brains are still developing, and they're not like adults (you know that.  If they were, you wouldn't have so many fights.)  This is the next big growth spurt they go through.  Their brains are changing and developing.  Their sleep needs increase (but good luck getting them to get enough sleep) so they're cranky.  <br>  <br>  Second link is an article on Interpersonal Communication and Effective Communication, and it goes into conflict management.  Really, it helps to learn as much as you can about it.  If I could give every parent of teens my Interpersonal Communication conflict management book from college, I swear it would help so many people.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Tell her you are tired of the drama. Tell her that if she doesn't stop, you will have to find a new friend to replace her. Then do it if she continues.|`|AA10757358	Ask her why she Always wants to fight with you.<br>  Tell her that you do not like it and the next time she starts something you will just go away.  Then do it if she starts anything.  People usually treat you the way you will let them so don't let her use you to vent her anger at someone else or something else.|`|XjJmIQJhaa	there are a few ways you can go about this, it all depends on how far you are willing to go to get your daughter to stop arguing with you<br>  <br>  you could pretend that you went to the doctor and you found out you had a very rare illness that would kill you in a couple of days.  You could even hire actors to pretend to be doctors and make it seem very convincing, the Doctor(s) could say that its do to stress etc..., and make it very convincing.  You can even put on makeup to look like you are dying and then have your family grieve and your daughter will feel very guilty for the way she has treated you!<br>  <br>  I know this might seem mean but Maury does it to keep husbands from abusing their wives by sending them to boot camp and in the end staging their deaths, and it really does work!!!<br>  <br>  If you are truly sick and tired you will take my advice!|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I hope she is your daughter.  If so I have the same problem.  Just over a week ago after fighting so much for so long... she started calling me names and then I open handed slapped her, she punched me... hard enough to bruise.  I called the police who had a talk with her, then put her in hand cuffs and took her away for 12 hours... time to cool down.  I wish it never came to that, but she knows now not to argue and has been better since.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	when she starts a fight, say something like "its okay. i agree with you." or something. teens are tough. try to keep calm and cool, and dont rush the end of the fight - let her stomp off or refuse to do anything for a while. give it an hour, then go to her and say sorry, and ask for a hug. tell her you love her as much as possible. best of luck, its a phase!
u7Y1SAViaa	it seems you met a hypocritical and obnoxious friend. You need a better friend and just dump this one. She's the type of person who probably hangs around for free stuff then leaves and uses her own money to waste on her self.|`|KpQuGhRnaa	hehe
fYh70EUlaa	It's a that age boys really start trying to act like "men".In my school they act like that to look mature and "cool".They sometimes do it to compensate with their insecurities and such..cheer!;)
N7gOE1btaa	If their hands on their pockets thats normal and not a weird habit.  If their hands are down their pants literally then its because there is some school-wide thing that thinks that is funny and normal.  I never heard of that or seen that, so its probably something at your school or community.  Just let it pass, they will grow out of it.
71VRvldJaa	That depends on the couple.  There is no set "normal" number of times a week!  Quality is better than quantity.|`|aMWpjYBBaa	as much as you want it...LOL! they're is no set amount! if you want as much as the next person does...then get it on!  what is it called , Nympho-maniac!!!

I appreciate your trying to be open with her, but I always thought it was supposed to be much more secretive than that.<br>  <br>  But yeah, most kids can't get their own hotel rooms anyway because you have to be 21 in order to get one. Don't feel like you're left out or something, I don't know of anyone who actually got a room.|`|FpmplIXsaa	Are you retarded? You don't tell your parents about the hotel and you don't actually sleep there. What do they teach kids these days?|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Your mom can kick your fanny out of the house if you buck her authority.

You do what you can to still have fun and still have it acceptable to your mom.|`|HOdblqIkaa	she probably doesnt want you drinking/smoking/having sex. shes not dumb she knows what goes on on prom night. she just wants to keep her little boy as long as she can. going behind her back isnt the best idea, chances are shell find out and wont trust you. you sound like you already have your mind made up but to answer your question no i dont think its ridiculous she wants to know you are safe on prom night.|`|AA11126544	You need to listen to your mom.

I have a friend who is kind of the same but im really worried about asking him to find out the truth just incase he gets offended. If your the same as me, just wait until he finds himself comfortable with who he is & brave enough to confront you unless you really are eager to find out just ask him questions like how come your not that into girls & make out you really wouldnt care if he was gay.|`|pdIWs1qgaa	My psychic-online-stranger-powers tell me that you haven't told us enough.

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Most women say they don't want jewelry as a gift. The reason being is that the jewelry is intended to be worn at the wedding, so it is for you, not for them. Usually it isn't a style that they would ever wear with anything else so it just sits and collects dust. <br>  <br>  The best gift you can give, other than your sincere thanks, is something that fits their individual personalities and interests that they will cherish.|`|rI7J9M8taa	Brooches are so popular right now as bridesmaid gifts.

You can also include a hand written note with some of your favorite memories. I wouldn't be too expensive and it would also be very meaningful.|`|omr1Kv3Haa	Get an engravable something else - like a compact. You can get nice simple jewelry from Davids Bridal for $20-$30/each.|`|bpvzeYnCaa	I bought all of the girls their earrings for the wedding, found childhood or adult pictures of us together & put one in their gifts, & also wrote a handwritten note to each of them. The notes did take time but they LOVED them so it was worth it.|`|LKVw9QxOaa	I think getting them tote bags with their names on it is a good idea. You could fill it with stuff they could use they day before the wedding to relax. Get them bath salts, a great smelling candle, facial stuff, things like that. That's what I am going to do for my bridesmaids. I have my own business making that kind of stuff. A lot of people love getting stuff like that!|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I think that a tote bag with items they can use would be perfect and I love getting bath salts, candles, body washes, perfume, etc. Nothing wrong with those gifts at all.

IPS3hWweaa	You were going over the speed limit, had you been at the speed limit or slower, your car wouldn't have been as badly hurt, I mean the kid wouldn't have been as badly hurt. You're lucky you didn't kill the kid and end up in jail.<br>  <br>  Hopefully its taught you a lesson and you'll obey the speed limits from now on.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I think you answered your own question.  You were going 10 miles over the speed limit.  You hit a 12 year old boy and then were more worried about your car.  You also still think it was his fault when you were going over the speed limit. <br>  <br>  If you weren't going over the speed limit, then maybe you could have stopped in time or he could have gotten out of the way.  Oh and to top it off, his leg was broken and then all you can think about is why are all these people mad at you?<br>  <br>  Maybe you should try looking at yourself and seeing if someone had hit you with a car and then acted the same way after.  Would you be mad at him for hitting you and think it was your fault?  Then you might understand why the people are mad at you.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	sorry, you are at fault.<br>  in a built-up area, where pedestrians are around, you need to drive in such a manner that you can stop the vehicle at any given moment safely and immediately.<br>  and FYI, 10 miles above the posted in such an area, is a LOT !!<br>  you seem too much concerned with the dent - shame on you.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Ten miles is a LOT, believe it or not. I guess society sees it a different way. You may think, oh he's just a kid, he'll heal quickly but what if you killed him I suggest you apologize and not blame the child.|`|VYWaL2graa	So you were going like...35 MPh? I'm basing this off of California speed limit in residential being 25..35 IS hella fast to be driving through  a neighborhood.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	people will get over it. life is precious so they are just seeing you as a bad person when you know they likely speed too.|`|KAiHiHkGaa	No it was not his fault.  Perhaps if you were going the posted speed limit he would have had time to cross the street before you hit him,  Also, it is blatantly OBVIOUS that you don't care about the kid.  And you don't feel bad about it at all.  People are mad at you because you are a jerk who hit a little kid, and by the way it was ALL YOUR FAULT, and then showed no remorse over it.  You are an awful human being actually.|`|6ZE3rF1Raa	The fact that you actually looked at your car other than the person you hit shows your standard morals and why others looked down upon you. Jesus Christ, you get out of your car and the first thing you do is look to see if it's damaged after you hit someone? Where's the common sense? You should have got out to check on the person you hit and made sure he was actually okay instead of assuming that, "Oh, he's alright", just be looking at him. ***.|`|wCjjBdzUaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  But you have to look at it from his parent's point of view.<br>  if you had a 12 year old boy who got hit by a car and broke his leg,<br>  You would most likely be freaking out too.|`|XJ6RxMQIaa	everyone loves kids! Chances are, little jonny probably feels really cool having a cast, and saying he got hit by a car!

You should not even be behind the wheel if you cannot accept the consequences for your actions. There is a very good reason why there are speed limits, especially in area's with children. That is what those little signs with the kids playing are for. Everyone has a damn good reason to be mad at you with what you did. You are very ignorant. I hope you learned your lesson, but by the sound of your question- I doubt it. You sound like you are maybe 17 years old, in which case I seriously hope your parents took your license away.|`|LsFihE9iaa	i don't think you have a heart you have to understand that you made a mistake and now you have to wait it out people will look at you as a jerk bekause you have no remorse for your accident. nobody's gonna feel sorry for you. just keeping it real.|`|kZ10nfTxaa	uhh...<br>  you shouldn't be driving. i feel really bad for that kid you hit. its your fault<br>  sorry :(<br>  you jus gota take responsibility for your actions|`|yG0lLbtsaa	LOL wow

3NoQuoWuaa	He absolutely has a right to feel the way he does. He needs to reduce his relationship to one of friendship. If that means he or she needs to get a place of their own, so be it. Outside of offering some information, there isn't much you can do. He is the one that has to make the decision. If he has trouble making that decision, then he isn't being totally honest with you.r|`|MY8A1MByaa	Maybe its just a phase|`|zikdyuC4aa	yes he does have the right to say no, if she really wants to be with him, she will commit. but if you ask me she has already made her choice, and he should do what his firsts thoughts were.. stay friends
qjcTgXcZaa	Fairfield County, Connecticut... Second richest county (besides Orange County) and top public school system.
gtTg0XOOaa	If she receives mail at your address she is considered a resident, and that would be your first problem. She has a "right" to enter the home. Immediately get it forwarded elsewhere.  If not, then you have the right to determine who enters your residence. If they have no permission, it is TRESPASSING. If you feel she has entered you home with the intent to do harm to you or anyone else who lives there, you have the right to almost any action under the recently passed Castle Doctrine. There is no law regulating (that I know of) her items that are still in your house, but I think that for the sake of ease and tact that your sister should be the one trusted with collecting and delivering her things ASAP. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and sorry about that schmuck.|`|Aud59N3Caa	hard situation i been there my boyfriend and my dad, my dad doesnt allow my bf to come to his house although me and my bf have our own place with our kids it was hard. you need to tell her that she has to respect your wishes, your letting her stay there not lease or anything and you feel really disrespected by her gf, tell her she needs to get her things or tell your sister if you guys can meet @ a plce and give her things back. You should write her a letter give it to her personally say you have 30 days to pick up your things or they go out, and if she takes you to court you tell the judge you gave her the letter and make sure you have a witness there to watch you give her the letter so she cant say that you didnt. thats the best i can think of. change your locks, or put a alarm or camera in teh game room. thats the best i can think of goodluck.|`|p3VaFWB9aa	look i am from tampa 2 just take all her crap and put it on the lawn like the white trash in land 'O lakes (No offence to any one) if she wants her stuff tell her to go get a U-haul and go pick it up and like on a street<br>  do not vandelize her stuff or put it in the rain just put it out there tell her to pick it up with in 24 hrs or it will be gone have your sister as a wittness because if her stuff is vandilized or removed with out her noterized you will be put in jail and put on the hilsbarough county sherrifs office website but if she threatens you you can A. beat the crap outta her or B. call the cops and tell them you where just playing nice. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck
3NoQuoWuaa	Maybe a little of both but for different reasons. You got the message to her about her boyfriend and she isn't going to pursue it with you. Weather or not she pursues it with her boyfriend is her decision. Drop it unless you want to damage your friendship with her.r|`|GmghrL4Iaa	she's probably jealous|`|yDRv3dUpaa	she noticed and she is just trying not to let it ruin your friendship. just drop it and dont do it again. relationships are fun but friends are more important.|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	It's me
wGyDRhT7aa	It used to be considered lucky to have a piece of the brides wedding attire. Back in the day single women used to rip pieces of fabric from the bride to keep. <br>  <br>  Now garters and bouquets are thrown.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	The bride used to throw away her garter as a sign that she would be under the control (literally) of her husband and not of her father. Throwing it away showed that she no longer needed her father to pay for her clothing and other items. Traditionally the bride did not remove the garter in public; she took it off privately, then threw it to the guests.<br>  <br>  The much more recent trashy hick - there are no words to explain how low-class it is - trend of having the groom remove the garter with his teeth during the reception has no symbolism or tradition because it's very, very new, and best left to people who marry their cousins and live with 32 pit bulls in a double-wide.<br>  <br>  It has zero to do with virginity.|`|UigJCMShaa	Today, garters symbolize mystery and virginity, especially if it is blue, and well hidden under layers of crinoline!<br>  But you don't have to be a virgin,it just something it stands for.
iOmw62diaa	Teenagers will be teenagers. Let them be and instead of wasting your time and efforts trying to please everyone, start pleasing yourself instead. Go outside and take a walk with nature, go write a book, take singing lessons, do whatever makes you happy.|`|Z96I7wlgaa	as a teenager myself i can answer this for you not to be blunt but they prolly do hte you teens are crazy and blame everyone else for their problems just let them live their lives and give them space and they will come around it may not be soon but it will be later they wont hate you forever<br>  sorry
AA11286455	I think she does like you.  <br>  <br>  BUT...<br>  <br>  ...the problem is that when someone you like is confused or says that they're confused--BACK OFF.  <br>  <br>  People who've come out of a relationship are often confused and need time and space to clear their heads.  <br>  <br>  Also, a large part of what they're saying is also that they're "not ready" for a new relationship.  <br>  <br>  Pushing her isn't going to help her make up her mind, only confuse her more.  It could also piss her off and leave you more frustrated as she pushes you back...off that is.  <br>  <br>  She needs time to relax, calm down from this breakup, get over any hurt feelings she has about him/the relationship.  <br>  <br>  Evejn if she says, or knows within herself that she absolutely hates the guy, she still needs time and it would not be unusual that she still has thoughts of him and "feelings" romantically for him.  <br>  <br>  Again, it all takes time.  People seem to forget, or don't understand, that it usually takes time to get attached to someone, to fall in love with someone.  It ALSO takes time to become UN-attached to that person and stop mssing them.  it takes time to fall OUT of love.  <br>  <br>  You can't, and shouldn't, rush her or push her or force her to have feelings for you.  <br>  <br>  I totally get how much you want to have her as your gf.  Remember, though, this isn't all about YOU or YOUR timetable.|`|KpQuGhRnaa	she does|`|LsFihE9iaa	you just need to wait until she feels komfortable enough to date again bekause it seems like the ex needs to hop off her bak before she kan move on anyway. so for now just be there for her and make sure she has a shoulder to lean on. be supportive and she'll see that your the guy for her
PPBP6AGDaa	Stay far away from him! It's not just the lust you like, it's the excitement and the temptation feeling. I understand it well, I've felt it before, but the feeling you get after you give in is HORRIBLE. That excitement is gone and the only thing left is guilt and sadness and regret. I would try and remove this guy from your life and put your focus elsewhere. Be strong, I hope everything works out for you.|`|aMWpjYBBaa	leave the dude alone...your gonna regret it..think about it, you wouldn't want our husband to cheat on you!  i sense that your only being with your husband/boyfriend is just because of the kids.

I mean, I would imagine you wouldn't want to talk about things like that with your parents. Just say you want a little privacy - and maybe they'll take a hint and stop looking at your texts.|`|qo2u1BCoaa	relax. Let them speak first. Be honest. you do not have to explain a natural step in your development. you could say something like "I got real light-headed" or "he's so dreamy" or "What was it like for you, Mom?" "How about you, Dad?"|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	You don't have to explain anything, but as parents are worried it could help to tell them that you like this guy and kissed him. Period. That's all they need to know.|`|woEoXfaZaa	If they know you have had your first kiss then they probably don't what to talk about that they have probably just relised that their little girl is growing up and just want to know that you are aware of all the other stuff that goes with it and know that you are being safe and see if you have anything you want to ask.  <br>  <br>  Don't be nervous and just be honest.  They just care about you - which you should be grateful for and trust me they will be even more worried about how they are going to talk to you about "the birds and the bees" as you are....<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|4w9gmvumaa	Just tell them  in a letter.  That way you can plan out what you want to say to them and you won't leave out anythin important.  Letters are always easiest.  Leave it on their pillow`so they can read it before they go to bed.

Chances are they were expecting something like this to trigger them wanting to give you "the talk" and now that it's happened they can lay out the ground rules.

It would have to be refrigerated and reheated and may turn out rubbery.<br>  <br>  You could make some muffins tonight that you could serve with oj and maybe some fruit or yogurt in the morning.  <br>  <br>  Here is an easy recipe:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Makes 1 dozen large muffins.   Published January 1, 1997.  <br>  <br>  Remember, if you're short on time, you can melt the butter, mix it with the eggs, and stir it into the dry ingredients. When thoroughly mixed, beat in the yogurt and proceed with the recipe. To cinnamon-coat muffin tops, dip warm muffins in melted butter, then in mixture of one-half cup granulated sugar and two teaspoons cinnamon.<br>  Ingredients<br>  3  cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br>  1  tablespoon baking powder<br>  1/2  teaspoon baking soda<br>  1/2  teaspoon table salt<br>  10  tablespoons unsalted butter softened<br>  1  cup granulated sugar , less 1 tablespoon<br>  2  large eggs<br>  1 1/2  cups plain low-fat yogurt<br>   Vegetable cooking spray or additional unsalted butter for muffin tins<br>  Instructions<br>  <br>         1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl; set aside.<br>  <br>        2. Beat butter and sugar with electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in one-half of dry ingredients. Beat in one-third of yogurt. Beat in remaining dry ingredients in two batches, alternating with yogurt, until incorporated.<br>  <br>        3. Spray twelve-cup muffin tin with vegetable cooking spray or coat lightly with butter. Use large ice cream scoop to divide batter evenly among cups. Bake until muffins are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Set on wire rack to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove muffins from tin and serve warm.<br>  <br>  You can warm them briefly in the microwave oven if you want or serve at room temperature|`|HOdblqIkaa	no the toast wont be "toasty" and the omlet wont taste very good because the beans and spinach will have time to wilt and leak. just get up an hour early and make it.|`|AA10113480	Spinach and black bean omelet; hmmm, sounds awfully sweet, for an omelet.

30DRtVkSaa	Ok, well I might be wrong but, I think she might like you but in a flirty kind of way. like she likes you, but not fully, she might be still making up her mind about you. Yes you should ask her what she was going to tell you but through a text, because then if you call her she might not tell you because she will be "put on the spot" where as through a text she can talk but not in such an awkward position.I really hope I helped you. But also maybe before or after talking, go out somewhere together maybe with some friends it will be fun and not as weird as being alone together. Also try to tell her how you feel about her, girls like that and it will give her reassurance, and then maybe you can find out how she feels.|`|8613318f79b2710303ce6007180c4ddfaa	she likes you! especially is she said don't look at other girls.. just call or text her it would make you feel alot better to know where u stand wish you luck!|`|P6gFd9Tkaa	yeah you need to go ask her I have had this experience (sort of I never got drunk and made out though LOL) So ask her what she was gonna telll you then if she says she likes you or something like that then you say you do to and for a long time and if she doesn't then you tell her but if she says she is not interested in you then still tell her but it might mess up your friendship.

But then she got a boyfriend. I was friends with him, and still am. But the day they started going out, it was like there was a wall between us. She wouldn't laugh with me anymore, hold hands (friendly), hang out with me- she'd be like oh sorry im hanging out with him after school. and id ask about the next day and shed say the same thing. and wed make plans like 2 weeks ahead, only to be broken the day before cuz he asked her to hang out. it sucked. <br>  <br>  Try talking to her about it. It failed with me, but you can try. be like "were barely friends anymore and i miss you so much. can i just have an entire day alone with you to hang out?"<br>  <br>  Dont rely on her too much, because if you completely stop being friends like i did (and she talks about how annoying i am and how much she hates me), you will regret it. if youre still friends when they break up, be there for her.|`|Xg2WmhPSaa	The same thing happened to me when I was in high school.

(-such and such)? Well, then, "the whole family" should gather together for a frank discussion of outstanding issues. If everybody "walks", and nobody "talks", the problems you're experiencing will only get worse. First, talk to your mom. Get her to call a meeting.

Sean.... its an act of "MAN... am I messed (messing up here?) make it stop.... say something to let me be the Dad... and yes ... have the last say. <br>  <br>  Here's the good part.... now you can "look for the line" in your conversations. When a parent doesn't ACTUALLY know what to say, he/she defers to what is not exactly up for discussion (.. Like I'm your Dad!.... like Dah!)<br>  <br>  Tonight I witnessed the (totally stupid) interaction of father and daughter: <br>  Where's your phone?  <br>  Whad?

jDu6KXEZaa	Love is a beautiful thing but no one said it was going to be easy. Breaking up is always hard especially when you still have strong feelings for your significant other. I understand you wanted to take a break from him because he wasn't treating you right and things got out of hand. In my opinion I would talk to him and tell him exactly how you feel. Tell him that you can't stop thinking about him and its been difficult these past few days for you. You need to follow your heart, if you truly care for him then nothing in the world should be keeping you away from him. I understand your friends are just looking out for you but at the end of the day its your decision to make. Your the one thats going to have to live with that decision and you should make the right one. If your ex boyfriend really cares for you then he would respect any decision you end of making and understand why you broke it off in the first place if does then he would get back together with you. I think you should talk to him and get some things off your chest. You never know.. you opening up to him may be an eye opener for him. Tell him why you broke it off and how he made you feel. Be honest and talk straight from the heart. You only live once, whatever decision you decide to make; make sure you follow your heart.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
Uz3no8awaa	yeah, Im a 17, soon to be 18 year old boy and I agree with you. If your daughter just turned 14, that puts her in what 7th or 8th grade right? and this guy is what a senior, junior in high school? This guy sounds like he's nothing but bad news. Maybe, maybe if your daughter seemed wise enough and the guy seemed good, wholesome enough, the age wouldn't matter but the way you tell it, keep the guy away. He has no business to be near YOUR daughter. <br>  <br>  listen i don’t know your relationship with your daughter but likely she loves you and this is only a phase. Every teenager feels like their parents don't completely understand them, that fine, cuz they don’t. but sit down together just you and her and tell her that you love her and you’re doing this because you don’t want her to get hurt, don’t talk down to her, talk to her like a human being, like you’ve talked here but more open, share stories, shell listen, and if she's still angry, which she may be, shell almost for sure thank you in the future, even if it’s not verbally.  Besides that just pray, the hearts of teenage girls are pretty fickle, just wait to another boy comes along this guy will be gone in a heart beat.<br>  <br>  Also reading the other comments if she really wants him to come over set up a place in the house where it is visible and you are home. this will in all likely hood drive him away, if they meet in private outside the designated time/place just cut it completely.|`|5ALjqBJ8aa	dont let her, im an 18 year old boy and if i was hanging out with 14 year old girls i would be a ******* loser,  its not right.|`|VfbsGjYSaa	Sounds like a very difficult situation. If you forbid her from seeing him, she might rebel by sneaking behind your back. Maybe you could allow SUPERVISED visits. For example, he could join you all for a family dinner. Allowing group hang out time sounds like a good idea. Encourage her to spend time with her other friends so she doesn't become too attached, since an older guy could hurt her feelings with out even realizing it.|`|3xfbVk8Vaa	You're right to want to protect your daughter.  An 18 year old boy who understands a 14 year old girl is clearly immature, yet he is old enough to drive, buy cigarettes, vote and be tried as an adult for any crime.<br>  <br>  I suggest you invite her to bring her friend over to the house so that you guys can meet him.  Also, make sure you have the sex talk with her (I learned about it when I was 12), and explain that you are concerned that this 18 year old might not be as mature as she is and stuff like that.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do don't make a fight about it, don't yell or anything, and don't insult her or him, but say everything in neutral tones.  It is definitely creepy that an 18 year old wants to hang out with a kid like that, you should have a talk with him if you get the chance.<br>  <br>  Stick to your guns!|`|AA10953999	Stick to your guns unless you want to be called grandma.|`|wphI41wNaa	Yeah you are doing right a 18 year old boy has no business with a little 14 year old girl she just thinks he's cool it will pass in time. Tell her she can hang out with him at your house but you have to be there and only in the living room lol see how much longer he sticks around when he sees she really is just a young one with over protective parents.|`|cXtEx98Haa	This is what parental responsibility is all about.  <br>  <br>  You have done the right thing.  <br>  <br>  Stick with it.  <br>  <br>  Restrict her even more if you need to.  <br>  <br>  Your answer is if they are such great friends, wait until she is 18 and if it is such a powerful friendship, she will still want to be his friend, but no way now.|`|F2rI3Juaaa	Confront him - Ask him what his intentions are! He should not be hanging around 14 year old girls! You are right! Good Luck!|`|jxpa713daa	my friend<br>  youve got it all wrong<br>  one, to limit someone to a dating age is wrong, theyll know when its right for them, not you - you have to understand that<br>  shes going to rebel and end up hating you if you keep suppressing her, now i dont know how much of an age difference you and your partner have but you have to think, thats only four years, my mom and her husband are 11 years apart....<br>  so it only seems wrong when people do it all the time, and those people often find true love<br>  <br>  now im not saying she should be looking for true love at 14, but you need to consider not suppresing her dating age limit, what she does once shes dating, and who she sees, cause thats not fair<br>  <br>  its like, if someone was to come up to you an suppress you, you might think, hey im an adult i can do what i want, but you and your daughter are equals, consider that<br>  <br>  the smarter idea is to give her proper contraceptives so that if she gets into those things shell be prepared and pregnancies hopefully wont occur<br>  i know i give my children them for christmas and birthdays every year, and when ever they need them<br>  <br>  and with the drugs and the law breaking, ever child will experiment, you cant teach them jack all by holding them back, please consider it
Xf9DrYgOaa	Hello Just need help<br>  <br>      Believe it or not I was in this very same particular exact situation. I was the 14 yr. old girl and my bf was 18. As previously stated, this is a very RISKY relationship. Now that I am older I would never condone my child doing this, but we did love each other very much. I was very mature for my age and so I did not have the mentality of a 14 yr. old but the truth is, there are other factors here beyond your control as they were in my situation. Parents! (this is a big one especially for the girl), friends, society in general, and the LAW which can bust your chops if your dating this grl who may be vindictive if you let her go.  However, it is meant to be, then waiting is ok. I still talked to my ex who I dated back then and both of you will grow A LOT. A huge transformation is going to take place that is difficult to transpire when 2 are together with such a huge gap. My ex went into the military and I went off to college and we were able to find ourselves and develop other solid relationships and are still finding new things about ourselves. However, we are at an age were our maturity level can somewhat balance each other out and if we were to get back together the pressure of feeling like your watching over a child from your end or her feeling your controlling on the other is less likely to happen. My best advice would be to talk it over with her and take a stand also because u are out of state. As far as her growth developmentally, I also experienced this when my ex went to Korea for the military and at 14 we can ONLY see forever! if she loves you she will wait and wait and wait which is not good bc eventually as she grows and leaves the nest she is sheltered and could be possibly regretful that she doesnt know what dating others is like especially if it didnt work out between you. My ex broke up with me when he went away and i put up a very strong fight which made this difficult but now that I am older I would of done the same because as you can see this only gets thick in the middle. But everything comes in cycles. He came back and I dont know what that means, but I do know I can handle it now which a better grasp of my thoughts and decisions. <br>  Ultimately, I would like for you to come to your own conclusions about this situation and time will tell you what is best.<br>  I am a therapist<br>  I know.<br>  In terms of sexual matters...I am gng to refer you 2 a friend of mine who answers these types of questions very well if u look on my profile he is the only guy in my contact box. Good Luck (: You'll b fine|`|wMCwxy2Raa	this is a risky relationship, being that you  love her you will stay with her right? right, so keep in mind if her step dad decides he doesn't want you around anymore, he will press charges against you. Meaning you will be marked in your home town as a molester, thats going to mess up your job life.<br>  you need a good record if you want to even start a life with her.<br>  make it easier with yourself and remember that long distint relationships dont last long.<br>  Why?<br>  because you will get tired of going every once and two months<br>  because she might get tired of just seeing someone who will only physically love her every ONCE and two months.<br>  She is 14, remember she has alot of growing up to do. including deciding if she is really in "love" with you.|`|dsQXmqsFaa	PEDO~!!!|`|J5klazJTaa	Hmmmm, how do you know that you guys are really in love?? Because there is no legal way to be with a minor.. The only advice I can give is wait 4 years....|`|EPHnYYEdaa	Remember you are 18 and she is 14. in many states that is considered either contributing o the delinquency of  a minor, and if intimacy is involved  you may be looking at statutoryrape, and other charges which include serious felonies. Some statues permit girls as young as 12 to get married. Some states allow such relationships if the minors parent approve. You need to go to the library or online and check your Sate's laws. are you allowed to see her by her parents? If so, ask if they would mind putting it in writing.|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	She is jail bait for you buddy. As long as you keep it under wraps and you know for a fact you love each other  go for it i guess. In my opinion you should really find someone your own age and in you town and state. Dont have sex with her because she can get you for rape even if she was willing because she was a minor. Please forget about it and get with someone your own age and in your state|`|UobA5ebEaa	I think that u should wait until she is older because u can go to jail behind this and I know u don't want that. But if love each other that much stay in contact so that u can wait until she is AT LEAST 17

They are simply a product of today's society, where being a parent is not something males and females are prepared for.<br>  My opinion is that your parents' relationship is beyond repair. Your dad returned and contacted you out of guilt, and possibly hopping the relationship with your mother would have improved. Apparently it did not, and being in the middle, you were the one hurt with that realization.<br>  I identify with you in the sense that my dad, for economic reasons, spent 17 of my years working abroad, coming home once every year, fact which I longed for. However, as a kid can not understand economics, I missed his present imensly. Although my mom really loved me, nothing could replace the male presence of my dad.<br>  Do not feel guilty, you are not the cause of your parents' problems. Although I do not know your age and sex, think of yourself as God's creation. You need to find and identify with your own friends, good ones (be careful), the ones who may be willing to confide in you their own problems, which everyone has. Identify your best values, and pursue them. Tears may help as a way of relieving your hurt. However, don't let things which life challenges you with, get you down. There are always two sides on every issue. For instance, think about what life of suffering with cancer your woman friend would have had if she were to live. Although you will miss her terribly, aren't you a little glad for her sake the sickeness is over?<br>   Attempting suicide is a cowardly way of becoming a loser.Since I suspect you are young, you will need at least an adult who can guide and help you cope with your life's experiences. There are very good counselors out there. You must seek help. Contrary to what you may think, there is a lot of loving and caring persons in our society, reason why I decided to confort you via this longer message. Our Lives is a gift, and yours is included.|`|WcioB4JFaa	I am so sorry for all that has happened to you. <br>  I think that you should try to reconnect with your mom.<br>  and maybe talk to a counseler if you are hurting.<br>  I wish you my best. I hope I helped.|`|LsW1id7oaa	You Deleted You`re Question When I Tried To Help. <br>  <br>  First Of All: Suicide, is not gonna help. <br>  Your story is very sad. <br>  I feel very sorry for you.<br>  If you`re an adult, maybe try moving out and living alone for a few years, forget the past.<br>  <br>  Get new friends, go on vacation, don`t think about you're parents. <br>  Just Keep In Mind, Don`t Kill Your Self!!!<br>  If you parents ignore each other, and that hurts you. Don`t let them see each other. Have Morning and Evening Parties so They don`t see each other. <br>  <br>  Do  Anything But Killing Your Self. Please. Suicide is Never The Answer.<br>  <br>  Dying will not change what`s happened, your parents would probably cry their eyes out if you killed your self.
ZgpfcCznaa	I know it's hard but you are just going to have to be straight forward and ask him how he views your relationship.  Tell him that you are having a great time and just want to know how he feels.  If he cannot give you a straight forward answer then I would guard your feelings until he has figured out his!

bc7efffa162ea47e8d6197c10c97040faa	true love is unconditional, if you love someone you shouldn't be suspect how much he/she is loving you.<br>  <br>  Many couples lack of communication in their relationship. Many of them didn't express what thay have in their thought with their partners which will bring a risk in their relationship. <br>  <br>  I believed many girls like to have a responsible , caring and passionate guy as their partner. but i do think that romance and sex (for married couples) are important as well to make the relationship stronger and long lasting. Never afraid to speak up when something wrong comes between both of you, find a solution for the problem and most important trusting. sometime woman is too sensitive(included myself)...we are afraid we are no more attractive to our partners, therefore, you need to show action how much you care rather than only words. action speaks more than words...bring her out once in a while for a romantic dinner, take more passionate and sensual time on bed and a little gift suprises once in a while will make her realise she is still important for you. When you are too busy with work, give her a call or two when you are free, just to tell her how much you miss her.<br>  <br>  hope this help...|`|XPPGphLbaa	true love is accepting each other as you each are.  No changes (except in case of health issues) - no demands.  If you did not accept your spouse entirely as he/she was when you married, you are up s#@t creek without a paddle.<br>  LOTS of patience is required. If  you and your spouse are experiencing major differences, then one of you must decide to put up with it, or to changee his/her veiws.  And  it is NOT always the woman who must do this.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	Love to me, it being able to make compromise and huge sacrifices in a relationship. Compromise on both sides. Love means to work together, and come to a understanding. Love means to truly, and authentically want to help another person. It means to respect. Love is patient. <br>  If you read the Bible, I believe that 1st Corinthians verses 1 - 13 really sum it up.<br>  I'm not "religious," I'm spritual, and even in my hardest times, I still believe this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://isv.scripturetext.com/1_corinthians/13.htm" rel="nofollow">http://isv.scripturetext.com/1_corinthia...</a>|`|AA10065812	???????<br>  What is love?<br>  <br>  I spoke on this with a Rabbi once, as he was riding in my taxi.<br>  <br>  First off, for those in their younger years, love is not an emotion as it is a desire.  The human brain does not yet have the conceptual ability to understand and truly feel love until well into the 20s.  Prior to that time, what you are feeling is the desires of youth.  The same desires that drove the need to have that latest toy, your driver’s license, and your first car.  The difference is, as an adolescent, hormonal changes get thrown into the mix.  Also added in is that magical date on the calendar that you become a LEGAL adult.  But, you’re not yet a physical or emotional adult, and as such, what a teen feels is desire, and not love.<br>  <br>  Even an adult cannot feel this, for love is not instantaneous.  It is a seed that grows over time, when two people commit to each other the goal of becoming one person.  A symbiotic relationship.  From him the woman draws strength and logic.  From her, the man draws emotion and compassion.  This is not something that happens overnight, or even in a few months.  It can take years, provided the right beginnings are met.<br>  <br>  There is clear statistical evidence that the couples who live together, or with someone else, and/or are married prior to age 24 make up 85% of all breakups and divorces.  This is the point when a female reaches full maturity and can understands what love is.  In actuality, she will be in love with her children, before she is truly in love with their father.  The woman is the anchor to the ship that is man.<br>  <br>  The symbiotic relationship even extends beyond the emotional needs.  The exchange of fluids during intercourse delivers chemicals that both the male and female body needs.  In males, it affects their immune system.  In females, it affects the strength of the uterus, improving the ability to carry a baby.  Found that one out just the other day on the Discovery Health Channel.  As such, man and woman are meant to be together.  But, not multiple men and women, as their bodies are adapting to each other.  Multiple partners disrupts this in that the genetic makeup of the chemicals contained within semen and vaginal fluids are specific to the individual.  Multiple partners has the body trying to readapt to every new contribution.<br>  <br>  All this together is what LOVE is.  <br>  <br>  It’s when your heart and your spouse’s is one.  <br>  <br>  It’s when your bodies have adapted to each other.  <br>  <br>  It’s when you can stand as one again all challengers, there is love.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_x24cVHr8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_x24cVH...</a>

Exv4AjqCaa	Why were you horrible to eachother if you loved eachother ? Lack of communication? what was it ?<br>  <br>  Every relationships has arguments, but if its a consistant problem & they get very out of hand...take a long time to be resolved...or a person starts trying to win the argument instead of actually understanding how the other person feels then you have to sort out why that is before you go back into it. <br>  <br>  You should talk to him about how he feels about things.....does he feel like he wants to get back with you? And if so, you need to discuss what the problems were with your relationship and how/if they can be fixed. You both need to be aware of the issues and both be working towards solving it.<br>  <br>  If you both feel like that, you could give it another go. Explain to him that you both need to be aware of HOW things will change...not just words. If you dont feel like that then move on. Its up to you & him.|`|A1rfDaANaa	As much as it hurt you, you made the right choice. <br>  Dont get back at him he will get whats coming to him.<br>  But if you want to get back at him when you see him tease him and were sexii clothes and stuff.

YCsKmZoBaa	Guys like a mystery, If you really are the average looking girl you say you are, then it should be pretty simple. If you are talking to a guy that's conceited (most are), just let him talk about whatever he's interested in. If he's a jock, let him go on about his sports to you, go to his games. If he's in a band, go to his gigs. Whatever it is, make sure you divulge the very least about yourself as you can. The trick is, after you've done this, started conversation, got it going for awhile, get him to ask about you. Then tell him things about you. Don't come out and say them, cuz then he won't want to hear it and be annoyed.<br>  <br>  Don't be a tease. Guys like girl-next-door types.|`|TlwWtoMXaa	Be more careful on what you say or how you word it. Maybe you're coming on too strong. Just be yourself but be careful with you're wording.

If anything's wrong, it's with men not seeing you for who you are. Don't worry... be yourself, love yourself, and you'll find someone soon. But also, take care of yourself! :)
VN3WlVL0aa	Sometimes older girls have a sense of "I'm older and I'm better", which gives them an inflated ego. They may think that because you are younger than them, you are not as "cool" as they are, and therefore they do not feel that they need to communicate with you.<br>  <br>  This might not be the case, however. It could just be that they are too lazy to respond quickly ;)<br>  <br>  But either way, the next time you see them, ask them! It couldn't hurt, could it? Tell them you feel like they do not feel like they are treating you like they should.<br>  <br>  If they refuse to respond, maybe it is time to let it go.<br>  <br>  ?Doomwyte?|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Give up on them.

xDdhUldraa	Get off the computer and sit in front of him, face to face and talk.  Trust and communication are the basic building blocks of any real relationship.  If you can not talk to him then your partnership is doomed before it even starts.  Express to him your concerns.  Don't be surprised when he tries to dismiss them with the wave of a hand.  He might not be as committed as he says he is.  I do feel you are being a bit jealous but if you and he are not talking then I can understand it.  I would give up ALL of the social networks I am on for a good relationship.  One thing to keep in mind though and that is if you are not ready for the answer, maybe you shouldn't ask the question.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	omg why are you with someone you don't trust? clearly you don't trust him because you are having second thoughts and thinking he's cheating. have you ever cheated? people only get jealous because they have something to hide themselves.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	well I do not know about the statement of not messing around because he is in his 20's. for people of all ages do sometimes. but I do not think he is doing anything wrong, I just think he is having fun with them. you see at times some males like to do this for fun only. a guy will enjoy such attention. But I do not believe you have anything to worry about. but the feeling of being jealous is a normal feeling. a jealous feeling is really a feeling you get at times when you feel you can lose some one you care very much for. really, it is the thought of being hurt that scares you and the thought or threat of losing him makes a person. angry. you get the feeling of being robed from what is yours. so Yes' it is a normal feeling. for you feel threatened by the other females. but as i said, I do not think you have anything to worry about, he is just having fun. you see at times a guy will flirt with a female just for fun. and it will never mean any more than just that to him, he is just having fun.|`|g8QMrSzwaa	wait .. watch . it could be too early for you to conclude. collect as much info as possible. <br>  when the time is right just attack i mean confront...

But don't loose hope if you really love her.<br>  <br>  Ways to get over her, hmm.. when you really love somebody time is pretty much one of the only things that can heal you.<br>  You can try going out with someone else to distract you or to just get drunk of your face and do something stupid so that you will have more to think about other than her, however this bottles up what you really feel (except for maybe getting drunk, you may do something crazy like hitting on her in front of her bf and starting a punch up making it worse haha).<br>  So my best advice for you is to just accept what ever you are feeling but try to stay positive, yes she is with someone else but what if you got with her and then it turns out it was more the hunt for the catch rather than the actual catch? (it perhaps could happen) But you've tried, try doing things you love and that makes you happy, if you have any passions, express them. If you're meant to be with this girl, it will eventually happen.<br>  <br>  Stay positive :)|`|oZXc84tjaa	Are you in the SAME realatioship as last time?<br>  <br>  If yes:<br>  Tell her that you just want to be mates.

eL268hETaa	If money is tight, I suggest you look at the wedding gowns in secondhand thrift stores.  My sister got a $4,000 dress for $60.00.  The money she saved on that one purchase paid for her veil, her shoes, her stockings, her alterations, and the dress drycleaning.<br>  <br>  If it's a beach wedding, why don't you just go with a white bathing suit and lace wrap-around skirt over it?  That way when the ceremony is over, you could peel off the skirt and "take the plunge" LITERALLY !!!  ;-)|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	I found some lovely dresses.<br>  <br>  1) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/183337?f=1541%3a1545&offset=1#_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a><br>  <br>  2) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/168708?f=1541%3a1545&offset=16#_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a><br>  <br>  3) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/168541?f=106%3a108&f=1541%3a1545&offset=5#_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a><br>  <br>  4) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/183388?f=106%3a108&f=1541%3a1545&offset=7#_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a><br>  <br>  5) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/186614?f=106%3a108&f=1541%3a1545&offset=11" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a><br>  <br>  6) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/183381?f=106%3a117&f=1541%3a1545&offset=2#_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a><br>  <br>  7) <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/gallery/wedding_dresses/vendor/detail/183382?f=106%3a117&f=1541%3a1545&offset=25#_chip=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/ga...</a>|`|ICeSfYSzaa	<a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Category_-49991498" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  This whole site is like, awesome.

YOKz66AUaa	I personally don't think it's tacky. I think it's funny that people get so offended by the idea. It looks like you're not asking for a super elegant, black-tie evening reception held at the classiest resort. Besides, what's really important in the end is is the marriage--not the ceremony and reception.<br>  <br>  Of course, to each their own, and I'm sure some people want to have the big spend out, glam wedding--if that's what they want, then go them, and I hope their weddings are fun and full of pretty details. But for people who want a potluck wedding, I suggest you look to blogs like '2000 Dollar Wedding,' 'Offbeat Bride' and 'A Practical Wedding' instead of following Web sites like The Knot. People can also compromise too, and do part-catering, part-potluck.|`|4POGapREaa	Really awesome & creative?  Umm, NOT.  Unless you're someone who has survived a hurricane & missing your house, or needing support from the community . . . NO.  So I'm invited to a wedding, right?  But I have to take that day off, get dressed up, drive, make arrangements around it, and then on top of that I get to COOK.  Yay!  Or buy something to feed the guests at someone else's wedding.  Supreme tackiness.  Thanks but no thanks.  It's not football Sunday.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Potlucks are fine for a 4th of July family get together but they are not appropriate for a wedding. The reason being is that your guests are not obligated to provide the food because that is your responsibility as a proper host and hostess. Also, your guests who are traveling won't have any way of transporting food and making sure that it is kept the correct temperatures in order to avoid food poisoning. <br>  <br>  Serve whatever you can afford yourselves, even if that is just cake and coffee.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	If it was a very church-based or family-only casual event, then I think it is fine.  I attended a pot luck wedding once and basically because the couple was very involved in the church the whole church wanted to be there and the couple couldn't afford to feed all those people, so the pastor suggested a pot luck.  It was fine, nobody was pressured to bring anything but so many did that the couple had yummy leftovers for days!<br>  <br>  Where I am from, this is very unusual.  What I am accustomed to is a much more formal event where the hosts (the bride & groom) provide everything to their guests so by comparison a pot luck would seem weird and might give the "if you can't afford it, why don't you just elope" mentality.<br>  <br>  But it really is all in how it is handled as to if it really is tacky or not.|`|8cO6c0Usaa	If I were invited to a wedding, and then told I have to bring a dish to feed everyone..I would definitley NOT go. I would be so annoyed. And I DEF wouldn't send a gift..<br>  It is not just tacky, it is rude and presumptious. I could see MAYBE if it was JUST the bride and grooms closest family that was supplying food to help out, but to ask GUESTS to bring a dish? That is beyond rude.<br>  If you are that broke, you should just get married at City Hall and be done with it..don't inconveniece others just because you can't afford to feed your guests..|`|SJx9IWWtaa	It depends on your family & friends and community.  For me personally and my family, it would not be tacky.  It would just be everyone pitching together to help out.   <br>  <br>  I do know with pot-lucks your usually switching out your gifts for some homemade food.  Meaning if they bring a dish, they don't bring a gift. (unless they wanted to do something extra) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I dont like potluck weddings because the bride and groom should be the ones treating their guests to the meal. Thats why they are called "guests" and the bride and groom (or their family) are the "hosts".<br>  <br>  Potluck would only be appropriate if the friends and family jointly decided to throw a party for the bride and groom.|`|YayTJZltaa	I think it really depends on the people to be honest.<br>  <br>  If you are part of a close knit community where you are all comfortable with everyone, everyone goes to birthdays/baby showers/engagement parties/etc., then it wouldn't be looked at as being "weird" or "tacky" in the least.<br>  <br>  Also, it depends on the feel of the wedding.<br>  <br>  If you are going for a upscale event where you are expected to have on cocktail dresses and a suit, then it would be proper to provide the meal.<br>  <br>  If you are going for a "come celebrate our union" type event where the entire community is invited and you are expected to have on a summer/casual dress and a suit jacket or button down, then having a pot-luck isn't such a bad idea. Not only will it help with the cost, but it will help stimulate conversation among people who might not have met yet.|`|o503YPrqaa	I am not poor by all means. But I don't wanna spend what some of these places are asking. 130$ per person to have a BUFFET lunch? HECK no.. So my husband suggested it because thats what we do for christmas at his family's get together. His side of the family is well more well to do than we are. But we all are not rich... just not poor. But we want to do it. I don't care who thinks its "tacky" all the wedding shows talk about is how stupid the word tacky is.. because everyone has a different opinion on tacky. We are probably having a small wedding, and a pot luck lunch / dinner at a house.  We are still in early planning.. Wedding is a year away. But Yeah.. I like the idea.|`|9XJZB0Emaa	I am not a church person so it is a little odd to me.  My SIL to be had that type of wedding.  She is a big church person and just about everyone there other than family was church peoples.  They seemed to think that it was the normal thing they do, so no one had a problem with it at all.  I was not cool with the having to clean up thing.  THat part I could have done without.  In my dry clean only dress toting chairs and doing dishes.  I was not happy about that at all...but it made them happy, so I grinned and beared it.  Good luck, I am sure it will be fine.|`|0ef832795209d3efd504064202cd3408aa	It could be done, if planned correctly.I'd set it up as a sort of buffet, complete with tablecloths and servers. Set it up in order of appetizers, main course, and desert ( you wouldn't even need desert items cuz you've got wedding cake). Planning is crucial, and  you may have a deposit,for the facility.|`|UuSquKa8aa	We had a potluck dinner at my wedding. We were young, poor, and had a very tight knit family. Everyone was happy to provide, and the food was delicious. No one made a fuss out of it at all. My GIL made 3 hams, so.... I don't think there was a problem. If you're on a tight budget, this may be the way to go.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	I think it's very tacky.  People are invited to celebrate the union of the bride and groom and they should supply the food to those people as a thank you for coming.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	My cousin had this at her wedding and I think that it is fine and that would be the gift, the food and as long as the congregation was OK with it.

Good luck.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	When is Valentine's day on your planet?  Here on Earth we had it last month.  He probably was telling you that he wasn't spending Valentine's day with anyone because he is unattached.  If he was interested in you then, then I don't think there is a little window of opportunity that you missed.  You could probably chat with him again a bit and figure out a date you could go on if there's still time before your Valentine's Day.  If not, you could always plan something for the vernal equinox.  Truth is, if there is mutual attraction, you don't need some special day of the year to hook it up.|`|TlwWtoMXaa	I think you still have a chance just talk to him more and hang out one day as friends then maybe little by little see wassup and then you'll figure things out. :)|`|DwiQ66qyaa	yes i think so. i think he's single. askkkkkk<br>  <br>  someone help me please <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aubj.960j_UpwCDoEdyhgKnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309224237AAESNIU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11376151	he was single adn you did miss your chance<br>  try again! be like so friday night you me and olive garden lol that was bad but u get the point

I miss my ex and wonder what is he doing now. When my ex found out I was going to get married he was very upset and cried . I feel so bad now. I should have married my ex.|`|KOjVWXOCaa	The feelings that you have right now are normal and it happens to many married people. Sometimes you get bored and you want variety. Please do not entertain the thought of seeing your ex again. Find a book and read, go to the movies with a girlfriend. If your husband wants to sit around and sadden the mood; don't sit around and be miserable with him go out. Just do not contact your ex that could not only ruin your marriage, it could also ruin your life. Stand by your vows and tell your husband to get up and go out with you.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Your husband prefers to be left alone most of the time, and things will be cool?<br>  <br>  You miss your first ex?<br>  <br>  Your second ex was a terror?<br>  <br>  You are unhappy?<br>  <br>  Why do you get married when you have things to fix?|`|IpWTMetHaa	Terror is sometimes exciting and addictive.

However, nothing is completely perfect, possibly the reason why you broke up with him.

jYMlAN4Paa	Clearly something is wrong with her...it could be emotional, having your father away or something medical. You need to tell this to someone. Call your father and tell him that you are scared (not sacred) and in fear of what she'll do next. Other than that....talk to a counselor, a neighbour, a friend or their parents, a pastor/imam/rabbi/religious leader (if you are religious). In hindsight, you should have called the police when she started throwing things at you, especially breaking the door. I'm serious. It sounds like she is a danger to herself as well as to you....calling the police would not be a bad thing. She could have seriously harmed you. Next time...run out and get to a safe place and call the police. That is what they are there for. In the meantime, try to talk to someone about this and get proper advice.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	I am trying to peace all this together. for why, she is acting in this way. there has to be a reason to make her so upset? it would help if you could have told about what type of things she wanted you to work on, as also does it have to do with her job and could she be angry at her place of work or boss to bring all this on. for I cannot see anyone getting so exited because some little something messed up of a computer. I can see as her Dad dieing may be what is on her mind and how this can bring this about. is she getting sleep? or does she lay there thinking about her Dad. as loss of sleep and worry could be the cause of this. please, try talking to her about this and let her know you cared for him also. this may be all she is looking for is for some one to share her feelings with. I believe that is all she is looking for, is just a little care and someone to talk to, as to show they care also.|`|Zl9eqKn3aa	I think that maybe you shouldn't be living with your mom.. If possible tell a trusted friend or family member you can stay with... That's abuse and it is not okay.|`|aTPJXwidaa	lol your sacred..thats funny!!|`|AA11145915	i wish i was sacred|`|PfP8LSF6aa	My mom sounds like your mom. I too have visions of her stabbing me with a kitchen knife. But then again I imagine things in my head, but I know they will come true one day just like someone either her or a stranger stabbing me. It will happen no doubt about it. When I was 16 my mom and I was having a argument in the living room, she started coming after me so I protected myself from her hits. I threw up my fist and said come on hitt me, she threw punches until I got her in a headlock, if it wasn't for that move I would of had a black eye. She has grabbed me by the hair and dragged me from the house all the way into our field.  I love my mom still. She has been through alot, the whole family has, she had 2 dogs, 1 guinea pig, and my grandmother all die in her arms in a matter of 3 months. So I understand why she's like this. She became very depressed, bipolar, she has seizures, and she was going through the change.  and I found her on the floor one day she overdosed on xanax her depression medicine. She also drank a whole bottle of whiskey, if it wasn't for me coming home early that day, she would have died. She went into a coma for 2 days, and I guess that is what it took too snap her back into reality. Now I have my old mom back, although I still fear of her trying to kill me, I try to stay on her good side. I mean when someone is that crazy and at that state of mind it's not good, trust me. It took 2 years and a couple of months, but she is getting better everyday, I still to this day help her into bed and tuck her in at night because she is very unstable walking wise. My advice too you is Love your mom even though she may tick you off from time to time, just work up that courage to say "mom I love you" and walk away before she says anything. Believe me it will pay off.

The word love can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from generic pleasure to intense interpersonal attraction. The word love is both a verb and a noun. Love is not a single feeling but an emotion built from two or more feelings. Anything vital to us creates more than one feeling, and we also have feelings about our feelings (and thoughts about our feelings)[1].

AA10065812	???????<br>  Medical studies show sex is best in the morning and it improves your health.<br>  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/article899012.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/wom...</a><br>  <br>  The end of the day is a bad time for fun. Your body is at its lowest levels of energy and oxygen. Your immune system has been in active mode for at least 12 hours, and the temporary storage capacity of your brain is getting full. This is why it's so important to get at least 8 hours of sleep, or 10 hours if under the age of 30 for males and 24 for females. That's when you reach full maturity.<br>  <br>  At night, during that period of time between when you go to sleep and start dreaming, your brain's ability to absorb data is shut down and everything in temporary storage is transferred to permanent storage through the creation of chemical bonds, and synaptic connectors, as needed. While you are dreaming, the data is being categorized. <br>  <br>  At night, your body washes out all the lactic acid that has built up in your muscles during the day, replacing it with oxygen.<br>  <br>  At night, your immune system goes into limited standby mode to regenerate and repair injuries, such as sore and strained muscles.<br>  <br>  When you wake up, provided you got a proper amount of sleep, your body and your brain are refreshed and ready for the day's activities, so why not start out with a little morning exercise before getting out of bed?<br>  <br>  The University stated in the above article is doing a little side research for me on whether sex in the morning is also better for getting pregnant, but based on the current data, it should.<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question. All my my best.|`|slHUNl58aa	Your schedules are really hard, my hubby and I have done those ourselves. That can really wear on the intimacy.<br>  You know if he hasn't had a physical in a while it would be a good idea for him to have one. He could need to have hormone levels checked, he may be going trough andropause, high blood pressure can do that as well. <br>  I think a physical is the best place to start if everything else is good between you.|`|3ad05f51839ba1e01125f9c9a1ac29a9aa	do him before he take his shower...z|`|k4mGOlwsaa	Sounds like to me he has high blood pressure my husband had high blood pressure do to his diet and drinking 3-5 energy drinks, and he was having similar issues a day you need to get him into the doctor|`|kHRD7uUAaa	he is BS you he must not want a kid so he is faking you out|`|Rkik3eUuaa	the answer is so obvious i can not believe u didn't realize it yourself - man doesn't want any more children. and if he says he does it doesn't mean he really does. he just doesn't want u to get all hysterical and explain hours and hours why he doesn't want another child. i bet if today u tell him u don't want any children and u already put yourself on birth control his "problem" will cure itself automatically. and if men do not have sex for long they finish, on the contrary, faster. so his excuse that he got overheated and had to stop makes no sense. and there is no need to "talk". talking isn't going take u anywhere, he will just tell u that sure he wants kids and sure there is a problem with his health. just to make u quiet. so realize it now and better ask him for the reasons why he doesn't want children. maybe his reasons are really valid. for instance, u can not live on one person income|`|pogNXtCiaa	okay well here's the deal.... if you don't use it enough it wont do what you want it to do now just calm down and when your in the mood take it slow never fast and if you take it slow then he might just last longer because he wont be so exhilarated..... now don't get mad or nothing but has he gotten a prostate exam or something in that sort???|`|9KIICFdIaa	Sound to me like he really doesn't want another child. Only in your 30's, you guys should be able to go at it twice a day, and have him finish off every time.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Same way he finished before you thought of having a child.....and if he never finished why is this a problem now and not years ago?   I would not accept excuses and figure out when this started and work back from there.|`|ckUBvd2kaa	Does he truly want another child? Maybe you should stay on top until he finishes and not give him a chance to "get away".

Don't bring it up to him as it may scare him more. Comfort him make him comfortable. Make him love you so much by being yourself and confident woman and yet still be kind to him.  Sometimes, we thought our relationship to our spouse are great but we are not just realising that it is tearing.  Don't panic as it is a normal marriage life.|`|eV0lWFiZaa	try a mini vacation someplace nice and relaxing, maybe three to four days, but the first nite, don't hae sex, go to sleep about 9 and sleep until your body is satisfied, go out on the town with him, enjoy each other, get back to why u love each other so much. that second nite just cuddle and watch a good love movie, try not to get into sex that nite, on the third nite make it happen, foreplay, lovemaking and afterplay, you'll see after relaxing his mind, he'll finish strong

FzS3aphWaa	If you had cared deeply for someone in the past, would you not want to keep in touch and know that their lives were going well?  I cannot imagine losing touch with the people that I have loved.  I am happy to know that they are married and have families and I am happy to be invited to christenings and weddings and family ceremonies.  All of us have cared for people in our lives.  It is wonderful to have loved and to have special memories of times and places that we enjoyed with those people.  As our lives move on we sometimes don't see our old friends as often as we would like.  It is not right that you have forced your husband to not see an old and dear friend.  Your husband has done nothing that he should feel guilty about.  When he met you, he decided that he cared more for you than the girl he was dating.  He broke up with her before starting the relationship with you.  That was caring and respectful to both of you.|`|x2Q5Cbbpaa	learn how to spell lady|`|O1lm79EFaa	well, I definitely do not have something to make you feel better...<br>  <br>  but you say he left someone for you? that only would make me think he would do the same to you

I am ok with the relax, go with the flow, caring non hard ***, but takes a stand when need to kind of guy (with an actual job, not one to be classified as illegal)..<br>  <br>  i guess some just like the thrill, excitement, the attention (negative or positive) she may get from it/him.. she may be the same way herself. Every woman is different and to each her own.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	By that logic soldiers and marines must be neck deep in women. Sadly they aren't.|`|a1pmr73vaa	That does not inply to all women.<br>  That is not my type of man..thugs are not my thing..But I think some women like them..bc..they like drama and excitement and sometimes more freaky..I once dated a thug and HAD no clue...since..he looked normal but once he told me..he stole the car on our DATE..I bailed like hell LOL!|`|snNPwf1Maa	He's likely to be sexually aggressive, as well.

Sometimes I wonder why I'm never attracted to the good boys .|`|GK8agqCEaa	women love excitement they strive on having a good time and bad boy's tend to know, just how to have a good time! When we don't give a **** it shows in are eyes, in are attitude and it just make the common male look that more confident, brave, stronger a bad ***! and lets be honest why would a pretty attracted girl wanna date sensitive boring *****.|`|cOBk3NxQaa	idk. it certainly isn't any interest to me. but some girls like the bad boy. its the rebellion, it makes them seem powerful i suppose. but to me, its a lot more attractive that a guy does right and is a gentleman.
jYMlAN4Paa	Call her or go up to her and ask for your books back. If she questions you about it...tell her you need your books back and that's it. I don't know why she wouldn't give them back to you.
53LyysJZaa	yeah what mike said he was looking forward to it kinda like a date but you had to go and blow it for him jk It's not your fault you didn't know but now you do so looks like your going to have to make a choice friend or boyfriend?|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	he doesnt like to share|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	he likes you and is jealous of another guy around you even if it is his friend.|`|4TqadRJYaa	maybe he likes you, but he thinks you like the other guy too or more or something.|`|yqpyUVkWaa	Hey, Guess he likes you a lot and even if its his best mate just wants to be with you.|`|U5mYBXA2aa	Cmon.. use the other 99.9999% of your brain|`|QyRBZ33zaa	I agree with the others. This guy is jealous and maybe regretting turning you down. Maybe he's suspecting some sort of conspiracy, like you're trying to make him jealous.
GQJbOblQaa	If you honestly feel your self respect has been hurt, your feelings had been taken for granted, wake up and think rationally.  Honesty, mutual respect are must for any marriage to work.  Couples do fight but that will be on petty issues, they make up subsequently and never allow things to go so far that relationship is broken.<br>  <br>  In this case, your husband had chosen to cheat on you and bring in another woman.  So, if you continue with this relationship, you must learn to live with this 3 tier relationship and accept the new woman who happens to be your sister.  <br>  <br>  If this is not comfortable, keep away from your husband and watch.  Don't fall for the emotional blackmailing.  Your husband must have thought about all the repurcussions before cheating you.  <br>  <br>  Be cool and calm, think rationally, never shout or get your temper out of control.  Sport a smile, be firm, convey your feelings clearly and live a life of respect the way you want.  You have a right to live a dignified life without anybody's consent.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|8KdPPF4Oaa	My darling, I know what your going threw.. Pack your **** n get out while his eyes are filled with tears n he don't see you leaving..|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Call the police and have him escorted out.  You are not good for him and he is not good for you|`|HMfg13gaaa	Well its time that you convince him your serious. You need to leave him. If you don't value your life enough to let him physically abuse you then you deserve what you are getting now. Pack you and your kids if you have them and walk out the door. If doing so while he is there is a problem wait for him to leave. Then poof bewitch your butt out of there.|`|AyG4sZOlaa	I'm sorry to hear that you have to go through this...You should leave because he's not going no where you should have left 3 years ago, and you didn't so he has you where he wants you! Physical hell no honey, You pack your stuff and leave...be safe!|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I'm not saying you should leave- that's your choice ultimately. However you should never make empty threats. It sounds like he's betrayed you BIG TIME and so has your family.If I were you I'd cut all the crap out of my life.|`|eVqU3XqBaa	It takes 2 to tango so if you're not both willing to work at it then might as well leave cause it'll never work anyway. But the fact that you haven't left yet and you're on here asking about it would leave one to believe maybe deep down you don;t wanna leave either. You gotta decide.....try and make it work or call it quits. Up to you. Sound slike you already know his answer. Good Luck.|`|hn4ro8tKaa	You can leave him if it's that bad. There's always marriage counseling, but that doesn't solve the sister problem. Sorry that's all I can think of right now.<br>  <br>  **** I AM IN THE PLAYPEN WITH MILDRED ****|`|dQ07Fihiaa	You need to forgive him but move on-the marriage vows have been broken and the spiritual ties are severed.|`|ckUBvd2kaa	Wow. Thats a no brainer. You are both unhappy and he has attachment issues. I am in the playpen with Mildred.
nNZIG19faa	i guess you can see this as good and bad. in the end, all that most people wanted to see was your aunt out of her misery. you should still be sad about her passing, its never easy to lose someone close to you but after a while you should say to yourself "shes better now that shes not in pain".|`|XmJZkFuMaa	My grandfather prayed for death in the end.  He lived to 102, and was just in daily constant pain, sometimes couldn't eat (he'd throw up whatever he could keep down) and was just... so miserable.  He wanted to die.  He knew he would be with his wives (he had outlived more than one wife) and he believed in heaven.  He was ready to go home.  <br>  <br>  When he did finally pass on, I was sad I wouldn't get to see him again, but so happy for him!  The pain was gone.  He was with grandma.  He was happy again.  I am sure of it.  <br>  <br>  So yeah.  I can relate.  I'm sure you're sad that you won't see her again, but you're glad that the trial for her is over, and that she is happy again.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	well if you think about it, it IS a bit harsh that you are happy she died. she sounds like she had a hard time, so its not a "happy" thing that she lost her life. she was not well, but i cant tell you what to think, so just know shes gone and its not her fault if she wasnt that nice.|`|woEoXfaZaa	My grandmother had a stroke and it was very sad to see such a strong and independent woman as see was being feed and changed and unable to look after herself.<br>  <br>  She - as best a she could told me that she wants to die and when she did,  even though I felt loss I was happy that she was no long in pain.<br>  <br>  So I know exactly how you feel and no it is not terrible that you can care so much about a person that you would rather see them dead then suffering.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	i'm sure that your Aunt is much better off. <br>  <br>  and people are upset for many reasons -- but mainly they probably miss the person she was before she became ill with alzheimers.|`|BUe6hAK8aa	no.<br>  who cares.<br>  she's dead now.<br>  so even if yuh are happy they can't really do anythinq about it.|`|aZojNNjaaa	i dont think you're pleased that she had to die, i think you feel relieved that she's not suffering anymore and she's in a better place. sometimes in these situations its best if the person rests in peace instead of suffering.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Mine is adequate as I've had no complaints.When erect it's bigger.
ZvkUBNOtaa	That's an easy question to answer darlin', it's simply because no guy that's good enough for you has come along yet.  Be patient and be choosy, don't settle for mediocre.  A good guy that adores you will eventually be lucky enough to find you.  It'll happen when the time is right.|`|a1pmr73vaa	believe me..weight is not the thing..You just have to be more out there and ask them instead..some dudes are dumbazzes and are shy? no offense MEN! some of them are just on crack or to stupid.<br>  <br>  I invested in a good dil do ! lol|`|gIzJaGTZaa	u are like my long lost twin or something!<br>  <br>  i have the same exact problem, and my friends say its beacuse im too picky. but i m soo not picky. is it too much to ask for something that moves ?!<br>   lol, jk but seriously, <br>  take a step back and examine the situation. When you talk to a guy are u too flirtatious or not outgoing enough?The key is to find the correct balance and hopefully the right person will come along. Good luck (i know i will need some)<br>  <br>  :)|`|C02lxopxaa	i dont know somtimes it takes time   dont get desperate and go with anyone tho<br>  <br>  thick is in and actually good as long as its not unhealthy overweight|`|u7Y1SAViaa	I used to have the same problem. It's the fact that you intimidate them. Chat with people and flirt. It's fun!|`|x2Q5Cbbpaa	have you even tried chatting up some guys maybe?|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	I'll say the same thing to you that I say to everyone who asks this question: the very fact you are here asking is a symptom of the problem. You lack confidence in yourself. Confidence is, by far, the most important part to attracting someone. People simply are not attracted to low self-esteem, and they can sense it. So I recommend three things to you:<br>  <br>  1. Work on the confidence. Build yourself up, then ACT like you are built up! People will notice, and people will find you more attractive... and attraction is the key here! If you cannot do this on your own, then seek counseling and get some help!<br>  <br>  2. Once you've done that, then it is time to get out there and meet people! Yahoo Answers is not the place. Figure out what you are interested in, then get involved! Join a club you are interested in. Do some volunteer work. Start working out at the gym. Take a class. Whatever floats your boat... and whatever involves lots of people. The more people, the better. The more people you meet, the more likely you'll meet "the one." <br>  <br>  3. Once you are out there, start talking to people! Forget this romantic b.s. about letting the guy make the first move or not trying to look desperate. Just start talking to guys. Be friendly. Ask them about their interests. And just converse. It IS true that they will usually make the first "move," but if you start the conversation, it will show that you are confident in yourself, and that is what is going to attract people and get their attention. Doesn't matter what you look like. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TlwWtoMXaa	just be you and give it time. I know its hard to wait but just be patient and when you least expect it the perfect guy will pop up out of no where. Would you rather go out with some looser because you hellah want a boyfriend or wait until you find the perfect one? Much love and god bless.<br>  -Linda|`|JP4u9EAoaa	just go with the flow,<br>  go out and meet guys but don't act desperate. <br>  you will find a good guy. don't worry. <br>  all people have different tastes and many guys like overweight women.|`|77afc9c6ef5c9139b7b20cfeb0ffb2bbaa	r u even LOOKING?  U cant expect people to just come up to u, u have gotta make it clear that u r obviously LOOKING & INTERESTED :-)|`|3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	Do you think you're pretty?  You'd be amazed how much confidence can count for.|`|kfNBVZH6aa	You don't neeed a boyfriend.|`|mdtkor2Paa	i would love to be ur boyfriend|`|Xfnos8EIaa	have you tried talking to guys?|`|96aMio5Uaa	I used to feel the same way - loved by everyone,and clueless as to why i couldn't get a guy. I just got asked out the first time 2 months ago, and since then i've been asked out three times.. I actually have started to miss being single, though i'm happy with my current bf. Just be happy being single, though. People tend to be drawn to people who are happy with their life as it is - if you seem completely desperate to get a guy then you probably won't get asked out because other people would feel like you'd date anybody and that you wouldn't be dating them because you actually liked them.<br>  Try meeting people, anyway. Talk to new people and make new friends - you never know what could happen.<br>  And be yourself, most importantly, around everyone. People love you when they know who you really are. Besides, you wouldn't want someone asking you out because of something they think of you that isn't true.<br>  So yeah.<br>  summary?<br>  - be happy with your life<br>  - talk to new people<br>  - be yourself|`|3eSkFLB0aa	The overweight thing shouldn't be a problem. I'm 17, quite overweight, and I have a great looking, thin boyfriend. So not all guys out there are shallow. You just have to wait for the right guy that will like you for who you are. And don't lower your expectations, you shouldn't settle. You, as well as all women, deserve the best and deserve to be treated like the most beautiful girl. Just be yourself and be confident enough to talk to guys and show them your amazing personality.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|UcWA30y9aa	It could be that you are approaching them in a wrong manner or it could be that you are trying to hard or looking in all the wrong places.  You will find that perfect someone for you one day!!  Tell your friends to be completely honest and open with you and give you suggestions about what they think could be the problem.  Try to lose a little bit of weight so you will be more confident in yourself if you aren't already.  If you don't love yourself ~ You may be showing that unconsciously!  You need to have confidence!|`|9MoytEURaa	Girls are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. The boys dont want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead they just get the rotten apples from the ground that arent as good but easy. So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them when in reality they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right boy to come along, The one whos brave enough to climb all the way to the top!<br>  <br>  <br>  so dont worry (= and im not lying about this .|`|HUrLVofYaa	Why would you want to?

It will happen one day.<br>  <br>  You know what they say about a watched pot...|`|cuGYuz1Oaa	Well you can't always count on guys to make the first move. Someone could like you but he's just too shy. So pick out a guy that seems cool and just ask him out. You've got nothing to lose and the worst a guy can do is say no. ^^|`|fqcvNut3aa	Did you ask someone else? Or are you waiting for someone to ask you?<br>  <br>  Ask them first!<br>  <br>  Or if you got rejected, then you don't need a boyfriend. Wait til you're a adult and you want a proper relationship.|`|SDP4qopIaa	I don't think it's a matter of you not being able to get a boyfriend.  I think you just havn't met the right guy yet.

Pretending to listen will only make her think it doesn't bother you.|`|GeTuH9edaa	no you're not mean, this is completely understandable if shes saying something you don't want to hear about your own mother.<br>  If it upsets you, just ask her nicely to stop and if she cared for your feelings, she'd stop!!|`|FwJLD1uDaa	tell your mother - your not mean. that is mean of your grandma to talk about her like that!|`|XX9pFFCZaa	colala29... is right
2LDGlA1Paa	Rule number one:  She has a boyfriend, which makes her off-limits no matter how she responded to your inappropriate behavior.  <br>  <br>  Think about this ... if she'd cheat on her current boyfriend, what makes you think she wouldn't cheat on you in the future?  Why on earth were you out dancing with her anyway?  Was that a "date"?<br>  <br>  Lack of trust isn't the foundation of a good relationship.|`|569a7cb7c1da8cc36ac60e88ef7c900baa	moonshine is right. she'll probably play you out in the end if you do try to hook-up with her and she might play you for the guy she's seeing now. She has already shown that she has you under her control. She led you on and teased you and you don't even know it. You're still fantasizing about another guy's girl and she's probably laughing about it to her friends.<br>  <br>  And I'm not hatin'. I'm just saying "peep the game" and don't get caught-up in some BS with a hoodrat. It's not worth it!|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	Yeah. I would just leave her. If you really want the best for her thats what you'll do, you've probably caused her a lot of stress.<br>  <br>  But if your bent on being with her, I suggest making your feelings known by being friendly but wait until she ends it with her boyfriend before really making a move because making her a cheater will make her sick with herself.|`|AA11376151	are you trying to die!!!! boy! if she likes you she'll brake up w/ her boyfriend and go for you<br>  if you really like her you'll learn patience and wait<br>  HOME WRECKER!!|`|BbRewQjQaa	Leave this girl alone before her boyfriend finds out and kicks your @$$|`|DwiQ66qyaa	hmmm|`|RoS6E0NQaa	i think you should play it cool. dont rush into it.if u like her thats cool but the only way you will know if she really like you, is if she goes out her way and come to you. you see she is already in a relationship and if you start telling her how you feel about her it will only leave her feeling confused and not knowin what to do but if you feel that you need to let her know a little of your feelings just come straight at her and say i know you got a man but thats not stoppin how my heart feels and tell her if she ever needs someone that you will always be there and if she allows you to you can love her better than he can. if she rejects you dont get all emotional just tell her that you had to let her know how you feel about her and that you still will be ok with being her friend. GOOOOODDDDD LUCCCCKKKKK|`|QyRBZ33zaa	It's obvious you like this girl, but if she's cheating on her boyfriend with you, then chances are if she dumps him she won't get that same daring thrill that you give her now and eventually move on just like she's doing with her boyfriend. Not Worth It. Sorry. :(|`|ZJB24VtRaa	Dude let her go. She has a boyfriend. If she liked you she would break up  with him for you. Don't come between them or you might lose her all together.|`|aSdxepyIaa	if she let you kiss her on the neck and stuff...thats practiclly cheating. Imagine what she would do if you were her gf....dont waste your time.|`|w7HWpFxjaa	dont mess with it if she likes you she will break it off and go out with you.|`|pNcVWxMKaa	Leave her alone... if she is already with someone, she is not for you!
XH2o1MM6aa	.Catch her off guard and ask her.
rurfFLDkaa	hes just tryin to rub that he has a girlfriend in ur face. he might still like you but i doubt it. he most likely sees u as a friend now
abpMkRREaa	You defieninitley have to just go for it, if you dont it will eat at you for the rest of your life, and who knows what will happen. maybe he feels the same way and is afraid of rejection. just be open and honest.|`|13efe42c1b43aea736580b4a5176e231aa	Well first off, it's hard to turn an "fb" situation into a real relationship, cuz he may look at you differently than he would look at another chick simply cuz of the terms of ya'lls situation.  Honesty is always the best policy, but if he's bi and hasn't come out yet then he has a whole other list of things on his mind that most likely don't have anything to do with something other that fb-ness.  I think you should let him know how you feel and expect the worse.  Not saying that the worse will occur but it would be better for you to prepare yourself if he's not interested in you like that, or if he doesn't want to go there anymore because you took it to another level.  Also, if you know he's bi, then what is the point in being anything other than an fb because at the end of the day your kind ain't all he's into, which means he most likely wouldn't be faithful... unless ya'll had a kind of open relationship but that is whole other question.|`|1pLm9AE0aa	let him know how you feel. you deserve someone that will see you as more than just a fb and will treat you as such. if the feelings are reciprocated, great. but if not, move on; at least you tried and you won't be stuck wondering "what if". good luck.|`|AA10831821	Just ask him.  You said that you think he has feelings for you too.  The worst he can say is no.
AA11155064	So ... it's difficult, but is it a problem?<br>  <br>  You are anti-romantic which explains the why you are like this -- but should it be a problem for you?<br>  <br>  Many are those who wish guys said it more often, and gals less often.<br>  To many males, the word "love" and expression "I love you" are rarely used, even studiously avoided. The reasoning is simple: the terms have a sacred specialness not to be used lightly. Too, once uttered, males fear being rendered vulnerable to the emotional manipulation that too often follows.<br>  Females, on the other hand, seem to apply both the word "love" and phrase"I love you" to everything that is not nailed down -- and to a lot of things that are. Breakfast, parties, dresses, sunsets, TV programs, events, flavors ... ALL seem to qualify for the descriptors readily. This tends to cheapen the value of the words in the eyes of those not as effusive. <br>  Maybe be it is just a male/ female difference thing: a genetic gender trait.<br>  <br>  By your avatar alone I assume you are a gal; there is no other indication by Handle or question context. You do mention "guys/girls I feel intimate with or are dating". If this means you have actual or quasi bi-gender emotions, perhaps in this instance, you are tending more to the male style of communication and emotional expression? <br>  If so, this needn't be a problem unless you want to see it as so. <br>  <br>  As a guy, I just welcome the more restrained use of the hallowed terms. :)|`|J14tPA9Eaa	you answered your own question..|`|13efe42c1b43aea736580b4a5176e231aa	Well at some point the honesty and trust should turn into romance and loovoweee.  there is nothing wrong with not being able to say you love someone.  It's actually a good thing because that means your not one of those people who just say it and don't mean it.  When you do fall in love where theres honesty, trust, romance and loovoweeee you shouldn't have any problem.|`|eBt2wwkFaa	How long have you dated the people you can't say I love you to? When I first started dating my current boyfriend (5 years ago) I had a hard time saying I Love You for the first month, then after making myself say it often, it just came naturally.|`|Y5uF2Jhwaa	yes, i agree.<br>  may be you are not like to be romance but it is  a very nice feeling <br>  may you must to try it.....|`|iJbslaQNaa	i agree|`|H1fw9xEZaa	Yes, I agree with you with the whole saying, "I love you!" phrase. But. If this is a problem saying to a person you are intimate with, how will you truly let them know that you actually love them? Maybe it will take you time? Maybe you don't want to say I love you, maybe because you know that they're not the one? Just be out there, and don't be afraid to love! It's spreading, and it's a wonderful thing, and all I am saying is to not be scared!|`|d40698db86744e2b8d4067b5798f110aaa	I believe the word comes with time and you are one of those people that has to show that someone is really in Love with them before you just use the word love. I am the show way . I believe love comes with time and understanding. You just don't use it when ever.
FzS3aphWaa	In . . . out<br>  Repeat, if necessary|`|pPZv2tTQaa	Ok for technique there are hours on hours of opinions.  The simple part of it is.  The guy has a penis the girl has a vagina.  The guy puts his penis in the vagina and moves it in and out.  That's sex.  Now there is usually allot of other stuff going on. Kissing for one.  <br>  Really though.  If your asking this question you shouldn't be doing it.  If you don't know what you are doing the girl will get pregnant.  If she is too young she could die.  Also diseases are a problem.  Then there is emotional health.  People who start having sex too young always end up being messed up in the head.  They don't lead happy lives.  Don't think your better then other people. Having sex at too young of an age will mess you up in the head.  <br>  As for pics and videos....

She wants your attention and she knows just how to get it.  I know you don't want to hear this but you are going to have to let her go.  She didn't want the relationship to continue, she has someone else and she loves that she has you wrapped around her finger.  It's pretty upsetting to hear you say that even though you believe she has a boyfriend, she gets angry  with you for certain things.  This means she wants to have her cake and eat it too.  You will quickly learn that women love attention, that doesn't mean they necessarily love you.  She made the choice to drift from you and break it off and now she has to live it with it.  I strongly suggest you start talking with other girls and quit giving into her childish games.|`|DwiQ66qyaa	don't give up<br>  <br>  let her chase you. backaway for a while. girls are weird like that sometimes. trust me. i'm one<br>  <br>  someone help me please <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aubj.960j_UpwCDoEdyhgKnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309224237AAESNIU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4tuT0YLhaa	She still likes you or she is just playing hard to get..not sure..maybe because of her past relationships is making hard for her to commit...

K1UicE7kaa	Look... all friendships evolve and need to be redefined.  You are tormenting YOURSELF.  Not all relationships can continue or grow as you want them to.  You can never force them either.<br>  <br>  I am sensitive to you because I had a similar thing happen when I was your age.  My friend and I had been neighbors and best buds for long time.  As we got older... He turned into a jock and I turned into an academic type.  Gradually, we got involved in different circle of friends and interests.  You are right it is very complex... I couldn't see the forest for the trees and didn't realize what was happening at the time.  Looking back on it...I fully understand now. <br>  <br>  It was very painful at the time.  We even got into some arguments when I tried to control the situation and maintain it status quo.  As we get older...our personality and interest become more defined.  It is normal to gradually grow apart in some circumstances... but many times it comes back around.  We are now friends years later as young adults and have new same interest plus memories of what we shared as teenagers to enjoy.<br>  <br>  Try to broaden your friendship base some.  Realize that jealousy is not a healthy thing... often it has to do with your own self esteem (suffering some).  Balance yourself some... start a new connection with someone that looks up to you some.  That would help your self esteem and counter the jealous feelings some.  Might be time to explore having a female friend... not a serious relationship ...just a friendly one.  Find someone that could use a friend like you.  They might be having the "same problem" with their girlfriend???<br>  <br>  One thing to learn in relationships... save out a piece of your own heart/soul so you have something to regenerate from... don't sacrifice your whole person to any one person or friendship.  Or you risk feeling abandoned, angry, frustrated, stressed, despair, hurt, used, manipulated... the list goes on and on.  You have to be your own best friend and look after yourself.  You risk pain if you expect others to be there for you...even if you are for them.  It doesn't work like that.<br>  <br>  I can tell by the way you write... you are psychologically minded and very smart.  You are very insightful... so I know you will ultimately work through this...But, it will be uncomfortable for awhile...expect that!  You sound like a really caring person and worthy of being a great friend.  You will also see in college it is less complicated than in high school to have many friends of all types and kinds.  So make some good grades while you are at it. That will be a healthy distraction and benefit you now and down the road.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|aWa5yBeUaa	i don't think its that complicated. tell how u feel and hope 4 the best|`|XCk0IOQIaa	tl;dr<br>  <br>  Get off the internet and make new friends.|`|vj3hmaflaa	wow, i know exactly how you feel. this whole question is how i feel alot of the time.

It's hard also on your husband in that he has to accept taking his medications has to be a lifestyle choice, along with recognizing when he's slipping.

Don't stay up late when you feel like this.  It is a sign that you are tired and worn down.  Go to bed; few things feel as hopeless in the morning as they do the night before.<br>  <br>  2. Find avenues to interact with the people you know.  I'm assuming if you are sending this question out to the internet then you don't feel you have anyone to talk to (or they are all in bed, in which case, go to bed).  My guess is that you probably have someone that would be willing to listen.<br>  <br>  3. Meet more people that you can build friendships with.  Church. School. Clubs.  There are a number of places that people congregate in with the intention of building relationships.  Go to those places.  No one will find you sitting in your room on your computer late at night.<br>  <br>  4. Relax.  In my experience (and I'm married with 2 kids...so I've at least been here a little while), we tend to take ourselves too seriously.  My guess is that your situation is not as bad or as hopeless as you have described.  Breathe.  Stop focusing on these things that are tearing you apart.<br>  <br>  5.

FzS3aphWaa	Tell us why you are still her boyfriend?  I cannot understand why you would stay with someone that blames you for her inaction.  She is rude to you and can't be bothered to keep her promises.  That sounds like she is telling lies when she says she will do something.

Not hard. Just enough to shock her, and have her ask you why you did that, and then you can say "You motivated me."|`|XKhNw221aa	You, my friend, have developed B*tch Dependency, look it up and follow A Pimp Named Slickback's advice.|`|KIaZ0Z2laa	someone like that it seriosuly not worth it. dump her! if you cnat, try talking to her about it but if it continures, then dump her! if you let this continue it will only make you both unhappy.|`|lISrOzyraa	dump her if she's being rude to you, unless your you know whooped. Why are you frusterated? both of you should not promise things to one another, it sounds to me like she's being childish|`|vaZ2qMQ7aa	Find someone better.  Any wench who will not take responsibility for her actions deserves to be alone.|`|cEMH6xGPaa	Get a new girlfriend. It is NOT YOUR responsibility to make sure that SHE keeps HER promises.

0dab405207bbcabf7450d3b041683118aa	It sounds like she likes you and thinks you're a cool guy and everything...when she smiled and said oh my gosh when you asked her out, and then she asks for your number, that is for sure a great sign.  From the sounds of it though, it doesn't sound like she's ready to start dating anyone at all or anything.  It's nothing personal against you, but maybe she just got out of a long term relationship and she doesn't want to get into another one or something.  It could very well be that.  Also, she could be playing hard to get.  It also could be that.  I would try and talk to some co-workers and maybe set up a group outing and invite her along.  If you can arrange a group outing then that would be a good setting where she might feel more comfortable and you two can get to know each other outside of work.  Best of luck!
03rggPF2aa	yes!|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	yes it's so beautiful!<br>  <br>  if a guy wants to win me over, wow - that's how he'd do it.<br>  <br>  seriously yes!|`|dAyf0MJUaa	I'm a guy<br>  I think theyre stupid.
