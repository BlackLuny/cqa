DICAS PARA ACABAR OU ESPANTAR OS INSETOS      1) Mate as baratas com a seguinte receita:  100 gramas. de cido brico (compra-se em farmcia); 1 cebola bem picadinha e 1 colher (sopa) de farinha de trigo.

A formiga n?o suporta cheiro de caf e v?o deixar sua planta em paz, pode colocar no jardim tambm.  3) Espalhe cravos-da-ndia no armrio da cozinha e espante as formigas.  4) Peda?os de lim?o murchos espalhados pela casa fazem as formigas desaparecerem.  5) Bolas de naftalina colocadas perto do lixo eliminam o mau cheiro e afastam os insetos.  6) Para espantar moscas e mosquitos, corte lim?es ao meio e espete vrios cravos, e espalhe pelo ambiente.  7) Para espantar as tra?as, espalhe pelos armrios e gavetas um pouco de pimenta-do-reino em gr?o ou naftalina.  8) Para acabar com as formigas de cozinha, espalhe fumo nos lugares mais freqentados por ela. coloque peda?os de lim?o murcho nos cantos dos armrios e da pia.

Make it big enough and water it as it seems to need a lot of water.     Try a corner of your sitting room near the windows where they get light and some warmth.     Go get a gardening book and see how it survives your climate. I live where my hydrangeas are in pots, outdoors, the whole year round. They're lovely!|`|910d6400e3adf163ae9d125e2113cf7eaa	I have had mine for about that long and put it in the pot and set it outside under a robellini palm.  Seems to be doing fine.

AA11474133	That can vary so much that I can't give an average.  You can probably find a typical rating of different appliances.  But one thing you can count on, if it plugs into a normal 15A 120V outlet, it will be under 1 HP.  Appliances are not necessarily marked with the motor HP, and it can be confusing because things like shop vacs and air compressors especially are have advertising of "peak" horsepower or some such, which is maybe the power right before the motor stalls or something and not the motor's rating.|`|96754efc18bee4c1541fcfda876960a1aa	none there about 1/16 of a hp|`|00c97740c9d17b016428e87f1e2dac6baa	what he said !!!!!!!!

If you are concerned about pockets deep in the forms that might not fill, you'll need to use a concrete vibrator to cause local liquefaction so that the air bubbles rise to the surface. |`|AA11900069	The typical lorry carries 6.5 cubic metres, doesn't it?

Have it checked to make sure you don't need a liner for safety reasons.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	As somebody who has had both kinds, I would recommend that you keep your gas fire.  The real fireplace would be expensive to put in, it will burn cardboard or wood, which makes more smoke and causes respiratory problems for susceptible people, and, in the end, will probably create more problems for you.  These kinds of chimneys sometimes have fires inside them, catching houses on fire in the United States.  You are more likely to get a spark that flies out of the fireplace and lands on a rug or something in the room, again starting a fire.  Houses burn down in the U.S. all the time because of things like this.  That kind of thing almost never happens from a gas fire.  Also, little children sometimes put either their hands or their toys (or whatever their little fertile imaginations come up with) into fireplaces, and this leads to all sorts of minor disasters.  We even had a bird that managed to come down the chimney once and burned up in the fire before we got it out!  How horrible that was!  Keep your nice gas fire, my dear, and count yourself very lucky not to have to deal with all those yucky ashes, or those half-burned logs that somehow won't finish themselves off, or those special logs that do light up nicely but then send out horrible fumes that stink everybody out of house and home, or the little friends who decide to see whether their latest Christmas present will burn (when your back is turned) and yes, it does burn, but it too sends out toxic fumes and blue smoke, and then the neighbors call the fire department...oy vey!|`|AA11283926	I dont know how to to do it but REAL beats fake anyday.

AA11474133	60 watts for 24 hours is 1440 watt-hours, or 1.44 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.  Multiply this by the kWh cost for your utility.  If it is 10 cents per kWh, then it would be 14.4 cents per day.    If you are really concerned with accuracy, note that voltage variations will cause the lamp to consume a different amount of power.

You should take this idea, but just get a bag of quickcrete and mix it with some water until it is soupy and pour it into the holes left by your dogs. If you leave 2-3 inches below the soil level, you can cover the concrete with dirt after it cures (1-2 days) and regrow grass if you want.|`|AA11736670	Layer the outside fence with railroad ties,nail the fence into the ties with fence nail holders.To heavy to move and dig under.|`|AA10092567	put some paver bricks in there|`|c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	Large rocks, left over bricks from a construction site.

You would probably not have put concrete in the crevices in the first place since it will always crack over winters and with time. You would have been better off just filling the crevices with heavy sand.|`|c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	You'll have to do it in sections because you will have to add or remove  the base material as required and reset the pavers. Actually, I can't  believe some one would go through the time, trouble and expense of  installing paver walkway and leave stones sticking up. Maybe the base is  settling. I think the real problem is tree roots growing under the pathway  and pushing the pavers up - I've seen it 100's of times. Do you have trees  nearby? If so, I don't think you can do much about that.
c3ad288725e89e6df16d12e392e5789baa	Wish I knew what area you live in. I live in South Texas and all I do is cut  them back to about a 4" stub and let them winter over and they always come  back. If you live in an area with a more severe freeze problem - throw 4"-6"  of mulch over them. Hay will work too.|`|0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	In England they keep them though snow etc by cutting the taller bit off to a more manageable size and put hay around and over and wrap wire netting around to keep the hay in place making  what looks like a  a tall wire cylinder about 3 to 4ft wide and 4 to 5ft tall filled with hay.

This a natural sollution of using stormwater that would just go down a drain and never reach any plants.    It is also a way of improving water quality in the area since the storm water just picks up any pollution off the streets along its way to rivers or lakes.    A pretty neat idea!

Rain Gardens are an infiltration technique - water is captured in a garden that features native plantings, and the water has a chance to slowly filter into the ground rather than run off into the storm sewer. It is a popular way to reduce nonpoint source pollution and has been popular along the East Coast for a number of years.|`|AA10341144	A rain garden is planted with native/wild plants and is designed to collect rain water and/or runoff water so that the water can be filtered before it goes to the water table.  Native plants are used because they have long, deep roots that can tolerate large quanities of water and also they don't dry out like grass does when there is a drought (grass has very shallow roots - so do trees!)

f66138921a229556904f2868c4198731aa	Well it sounds like you have hot weather and may have problems watering.  With that in mind, I would plant portulaca because it grows in containers, likes the heat, and doesnt require much watering.   Or you could plant geraniums with dusty miller--also add polymers/gel.  They sell these crystals that when water is added they retain the water to help the plants so they wont dry out.   Also make sure there are drainage holes--if no drainage holes, either drill holes, or put small  rocks at the bottom for drainage.  This pot will dry out easily in the heat so you may need to water more frequently.  Also, make sure you use liquid fertilzer.|`|JNqswNPqaa	If you want to use herbs, you could plant oregano.  If you would like flowers, wave petunias are great.  You could also plant geraniums with some vinca around the edges of the pot--it takes some of the height away and looks very finished and pretty draping out of the pot.|`|b3baee7b0a2713d86bae78181f187850aa	That depends on where you live! Those on this website are from all over the world. I was going to suggest beans, but you already had them there. How about veggies like lettuce or spinach?     We have long plastic pots too: three feet by ten inches by ten inches. It did a round of beans, then okra, aubergines, then marigolds, then at present it has some relative of the sugarcane plant in it. Other similar pots have got dianthus, torenia, tall bunches of dill, or just seedlings.    If you live in a cool climate, I would suggest begonias, and maybe strawberry plants. If you live in a hot tropical climate, it would be good to have bouganvillea or cannas. Have fun!

AA11474133	Doesn't look like anyone helped you to actually figure out what is wrong.  There are many places that explain how to wire it which would show you have power coming in to the "common" terminal of one 3-way, the other two terminals (the travelers) connect the the 4 way.  The light is connected to the common of the other 3 way, with the travelers connected to the the 4 way.    First you need to make sure the common wire is connected to the common of each 3 way.  If you disconnect all the wires from the switches, the common that is the power will have voltage and the common that is the light will have continuity to ground (though the light bulbs, assuming they are installed).  No other wire in the 3 way boxes should have voltage or continuity.  Connect those commons to the common of the 3way.    At the 4 way, the two pairs of travelers might be obvious (because they come from 2 different cables), but if you need to check them, look for voltage and continuity to ground with the 4way switch removed, and flip the 3 way switches to test both sides.  This should tell you which travelers go to each 3way.|`|7tJZ4mp2aa	Those answers should get you going, but I think your problem was in assuming that the positions of the screw connections on the new switch were the same as the old switch, which ain't necessarily so.    Taking a 3-way switch as an example, with 3 screws, usually 2 of the screws will be one color (well really just a different shade of copper) with the remaining one different than the 2 others.    Match those colors regardless of physical position on the switch and there ya go.    The sorta nice thing about working on 3/4 way circuits is that although you can easily screw up the connections, because there is no neutral line involved you aren't at much risk of shorting things out or creating a hazardous situation, just one that doesn't work.|`|Jh7CmSa8aa	People really confuse themselves on 3 way switches and 4 ways switches.  My community college students were always amazed at how easy they really are.    A 4 way has nothing on it but the travelers from the two three way switches. Forget hots, neutrals and all of that.  If you have two three ways, then the travelers run from one to the other and no where else.  A 4 way just simply splits those travelers.  You can add 10 4 ways in if you want, and it's just as easy for every one.    This guide will help you understand.  http://www.wfu.edu/~matthews/courses/p23...    Good luck!    http://www.rickdoan.com|`|VUNTunxiaa	If you really think about it, you could not possibly have put all of the wires back in the exact same places, or the light would work just fine.    If you have a home wired with Type NM Cable ("Rope" or Romex - which is really a Trade Marked Brand Name), you should indeed have a red wire in each box, along with a black and a white. One box will have an additional conductor of a color other than white, or wrapped with phase tape that is any color other than white or gray.    First, make sure that you have the two 3-ways in the correct place on the lighting control circuit. You will probably have 2 locations with 3 conductors; 2 "travelers" for the switch legs, and one hot. The "hot" goes to the single terminal, the travelers will each be terminated below one of the screw-posts at the opposite end of the switch. (Picture the letter Y, the hot conductor goes on the bottom, the travelers on the top.)    The 4-way goes in the center, where you will find 4-conductors, all will be travelers for the switch leg. Nothing should be "hot" in this box unless one of the 3-ways is closed.    Use different colors of phase tape to ID the different conductors and keep playing around with the configuration until you get it right.    In the time it will take you to figure it out, you could have paid for a licensed electrician to do it without mistakes. Even simple switching circuits can be problematic if you don't know what you are doing.    It's a good thing there was only one 4-way in the set up; you can only use two 3-way switches, but can add as many 4-ways as you want.
AA11474133	You removed a light fixture, right?  What was connected to the white and black wires of the light?  That should connect to the fan.  If you disconnected other connections in the box, I can't help you and you probably need to get an electrician.  One of the white/black pairs is probably for the switch and the other 2 are power, unless there is another light on the same switch.    There is no such thing as a 2 way switch.  Do you mean you have 2 switches for the light?  If so, they are 3way switches (I didn't make up the terminology).  That either has nothing to do with your fan wiring, or you have red wires in the ceiling that you didn't mention.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Here is the answer to your question see the lowes web site on how to hook up a ceiling fan   http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=ho...
AA11474133	You are talking about a box to mount the fixture, that would be a fixture box, not the ones the other answers talked about.  Plus being in Chicago you'll need a metal box.

VUNTunxiaa	You must contact the Manufacturer and install conductors and over-current protection per their requirements. HVAC equipment will sometimes require wiring that does not conform to NEC Table 310.16, and breakers that are standard, per 220.6, but not standard when it comes to supply houses keeping them in stock.    Installing the wrong size conductor or over-current protection will void the listing of the product, making it impossible to prove that it is "safe" without paying big bucks for a "Field Evaluation".    Regarding installing a sub-panel (Feeder Panel is what it is referred to as in the NEC):    When more than 2 circuits are provided for in a feeder panel (sub-panel), the smallest over-current device that you can use for the feeder panel is 60 Amps; unless your terminals are rated at only 140 degrees F, you must use  6 AWG conductors to the feeder. If the terminals of the over-current protection device are rated at 140 F, you must use  4 AWG conductors.    If you use a Main Lug Only load center as a feeder panel, and decide to "back-Wire a 60 AMP Double Pole breaker as a disconnect at the feeder panel, you must obtain the "bolt-in" kit to prevent that breaker from accidentally being knocked loose.    Any Sub-panel you install must have the Main Bonding Jumper removed.    You sound confused enough that you should really think about hiring a professional Installer and a licensed electrical contractor.|`|Rh2th9zqaa	Use a 30 Amp breaker and 10 AWG wire for both runs.

9oiZ6Rmbaa	It's not confusing, I know exactly what you are talking about.  I had the same problem and found a simple solution by being a little creative.    Using some flexible wire, I created a holder with a loop a little smaller than the wide part of the cone, and a base wide enough to snap into a bottle cap.      You can put the cone in the loop pointy side down and it is suspended over the bottle cap.    Just light the point end and the whole thing burns from the bottom up.  Ashes don't usually fall off, but if they do they fall in the cap.    Hope you understand what I am trying to describe.

NJULnXiyaa	Tulips are usually propagated by dividing up bulb clusters. A bulb will produce bulblets at its base which will grown bigger and then can be divided off (after a couple of years). They can also produce seed and can be either self or cross pollinated. New hybrids are developed through controlled cross species/variety pollination.  An interesting side note - during the 1600's the Dutch tulip market went wild and new, rare varieties were getting big bucks. Eventually, the tulip market crashed and many of the rich tulip brokers went broke (very similar to the stock market biotech and internet company bubbles of the 1990's).  You'll have to do your own homework for the rest.    -Brian|`|sq9AtIRHaa	I'm pretty sure tulips are asexual.  http://www.botanical-online.com/flortuli...
ZA18KoC9aa	I think the chores should be divided equally between you and your brother. Its unfortunate being the oldest (especially if you are a girl) as you are expected to do a lot around the house while the younger siblings (especially boys) have little or no work to do at all. I have a brother who is your age and he hardly does any work at all, while I'm (at 20) expected to help out with the laundry, vacuuming, cooking etc!    For your last two questions I believe each person is responsible for making his/her bed and putting the laundry in the appropriate place at home.|`|NuvKPl3naa	my children do not go in my room to clean. i think there should be a schedule and every day have a chore that needs to be done. that is life everyday there is always something to do. they should help.|`|AA10097817	Okay, parents both work, but your brother is home schooled...by whom?    You are 17. Sounds like you are working for your room and board. Not horrendous, but not fun.    Soon you will be 18. Start planning. Actually, you probably don't need to wait, but to be safe, you should.    Do you plan to go to college? I'd look into that.|`|4MYJpkZcaa	I think your brother is old enough to do his own laundry. At my house we have a policy do your own laundry and dishes then if mom/dad asks for help you give it. That's not saying much though seeing as I'm an only child. Personally, I think your brother should pick it up a little bit; having school is no excuse and he's home-schooled so that cuts out travel time and getting up super early to catch the bus.  His perspective might be different I bet he makes a big deal about you not having a job... :p Regardless of that I think he should do a bit more- that's just my opinion though.  Do you plan to go to college?
H5DdF6V9aa	Use a sanding sponge to sand down the texture where the boarder will be. Lightly moisten the sponge to keep dust at a minimum and be accurate with your sanding- sand too low and you will be able to notice the missing texture, even after paint touch-ups. Good luck with your project.l|`|KT8RatG1aa	It would be best to use wall cloth first. Paste it with wall paper paste and apply to wall and let it dry.Some wall cloth comes pre pasted.

Use a wet sponge over the wall paper first and then apply the wall paper paste.

VUNTunxiaa	7 hours without water can hardly be classified as anything more than a slight inconvenience; especially when you were probably asleep through almost half of the shutdown.    A landlord or property manager can hardly be expected to maintain the property without having shutdown a system for repairs every now & then.    [With 30 days in a month, you have 720 hours. Divide 7 by 720 and you will see that a fair amount (from your point of view) would be a reduction of .9722222%. If your rent were $1,000.00 per month, it would save you around $9.72; hardly enough to be worth arguing over.]|`|AA10097817	No, things happen.

TXddP0uxaa	Generally, vinegar is a great way to kill mold.  It works like a charm on laundry that the kids leave wet in the bottom of the hamper.  However, with carpet, I'd be afraid that the damage got down into the pad and the subflooring.  You might want to call a cleaning service to assess the damage and see if the carpet is salvagable.  At this point though, you should probably count on having to replace it.  Check with your home owners insurance, they may pay for repair and or replacement.|`|FzyMni8caa	Try using an antifungal spray on it, you can get one at most hardware stores. Be careful how you use it though, maybe spray the back of the carpet. in any case the carpet needs to be lifted as mould will grow on the floor below.|`|PgJcYuYvaa	I am a master floor installer and been certified in mold and sick home syndrome.If it smells after water damage you probably have mold growing.If you do research you will find for your safety you might want to replace.Blue and black mold is deadly with no symptoms.
VUNTunxiaa	There is a bit more involved in this than simply opening up the framed wall in the front and installing a new overhead door.    If there are any recessed lights in the ceiling, they must be removed, or otherwise dealt with to reestablish the required "Fire Separation" between the garage and the habitable space. The same would apply to any ducts for conditioned air (heating or cooling) and for return air.    The door between the garage and the house would possibly need to be changed back to a listed fire-rated door; and if the house had had any other remodeling done along with the garage conversion, you may have to correct things like not entering a bedroom directly from the garage.    Call your local Building Department and ask to speak to an Inspector. They probably won't be able to give you too much info right away, as that generally requires that you file a "Freedom of Information Act" request form, and pay whatever fee is required to process your request. It can take up to 3 weeks to get this info (a home inspector should ask for this info, anyway).    You can talk to your realtor regarding an offer contingent on the house not requiring repairs to other than the overhead door; then you will be able to make your offer and wait to see what the Building Department file says about the property. You can make a final decision based on the amount of work needing to be re-done to make the garage Code compliant.    You should also check the Zoning Ordinance regarding what type of Business Equipment you are allowed to store in a Residential Garage; some towns have very tight regulations regarding that, others have none.|`|944iJNAdaa	This won't be particularly hard.  A large part of it will involve how expensive of a garage door you want to put back in.  Since you aren't actually going to be parking inside, I wonder if you could just add an entry door instead, but you don't mention how large the stuff is you need to store.  I would think $1000 labor might cover this job plus materials.|`|H5DdF6V9aa	I'm sure the overhead door framing is all still intact and ready for a new door. The biggest hassle will be finishing the exterior. Even vinyl siding will need a tear down and rehang after the door is trimmed out. Still, this project can be done over a long weekend and can be kept under $500, even much less depending on size/ quality of overhead door and weather you will be buying an opener or not. Wood and siding trim will cost you a Cnote or two. Good luck with your project.
05bV2GuFaa	You can have the African theme, get some orange and green into the room. Plants is a great way to bring in colors, and pillows for the seating area, of course, a nice picture behind the sofa. Get some ethnical type of vases, wood carving for the decoration on the wall.

If it,s more than three hours and your garden is,nt shady, then most of the plants will grow. Since you are new to this so instead of getting into perennials, annuals stuff. Here are few common names. Roses, Jasminium, pansy, petunia, phlox, lilies,dahlia, forget-me-not. There are lot of other plants but i named few common ones  But if your garden has partial shade or less, then your choice of flowering plants is limited.

vF3vnFU8aa	Nails are not the best (or even a good) solution to your problem. I suppose you could place a 3rd board alongside these two, then nail these two to that 3rd board. Not knowing what part of the desk you are intending these boards to become is a hindrance.    A better, and fairly simple, solution would be to place a few marks on the end of each of these boards, so the marks line up when placed end to end, and drill corresponding holes into the end of each board. Then cut some short pieces of dowel and glue them into the holes on one of the boards. Apply glue to the edge, and to the dowels, then slide the pieces together. Clamp and promptly wipe off any glue that escapes the joint.    http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l125/s...    Pretty sure this method has a name, I just can't think of it right now.|`|ANZzSYU6aa	do you have to connect like that or could you use a longer board?

I bought a whirlpool set about 5-6 years ago, the cheapest set they had at Lowe's.  I do at least 5 loads of laundry a day, between clothes, sheets, bath towels, kitchen towels, and everything else.      Some of the front load washers take forever to wash clothes.  Another thing you may want to look at is the Energy star rating when you buy.     I think loading the washer too full can be a problem, and it will wear out quicker because it is working twice as hard- it's not so much the brand.    I don't plan on replacing my washer and dryer until I have to; however I plan on buying Whirlpool again.
944iJNAdaa	I always make birdhouses out of old recycled, unpainted lumber.  Birds prefer weathered lumber to new lumber, and my houses almost always attract birds, too.

07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	One other trick to try is to look at the rotating spray arm and see if the holes in it look clogged. Sometimes little scraps of chicken bones or pieces from a broken glass get in there and stifle the water flow. If you see that in there try removing the rotating arm and flushing it out by running water into the holes and trying to shake out the debris. Some may also come out by pulling it through the holes with a tweezers.|`|cplaV2KWaa	On some models there is a filter on the flush side. Changing or deleting this filter may help. Rinsing agent is a must.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	We do not know the root cause.  However here are things you can try    1.  Remove hard water deposits - These deposits will block the orfices through which the wash water is directed to the dishes.  As the orfices constrict, water flow is diverted elsewhere.  Vinegar may do the job but you will probably be better served with a specially designed formulation for removing hard water build up in dishwashers.  Usually you put this powder or tablet in the dishwasher's detergent container and run a long wash cycle with no dishes inside.  If things are still visibly hard water fouled, repeat the process with new hard water remover.    2.  Some models have filters that collect insoluble foods that are in the water before the water is pumped back onto the dishes.  If you have these filters, you must remove, clean, and replace them.  Usually they are a fine screen and need to be back washed.  If worn badly, replacement is required.  To keep this from happening in the future, rinse and remove food residue (by hand if needed) prior to putting dishes in the washer.  A little precleaning before inserting makes a major difference in dishwasher performance and in maintenance avoidance - however most people will not do this and pay the price in unclean dishes, prolonged wash cycle need, and higher maintenance.

You could also only remove the paneling from 4.5 feet up to the ceiling, add chair rail and paint the wall one colour and the paneling white.    It can't hurt to try this first- if you hate the results, you are only out of a little time and a gallon of paint and you can still remove and sheetrock the wall.|`|V0PDyZDfaa	If Money is the deciding factor, fill, and paint with Kilz Paint, you will not need to prime.

With a straight edge and carpet knife cut 4 inch squares make sure you have square corners.  Now just peel the back and stick to wall behind sink creating a pattern you like.  Total price not including your labor is only a few bucks these tiles are 2 or 3 dollars each and if your area is small even better.

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	Well, probably the same reason you don't see Peter Pan Peanut Butter commercials with babies in ICU on oxygen from eating their peanut butter and crackers.  I use bleach and while I can sympathize with you and your family having asthma, I know lots of people, including myself, use it with no ill effects.  I understand you are not one of them.  We used the solution for disinfection of all our churchs childrens toys and surfaces in the childcare/nursery and we haven't had ANY complaints of children having any breathing issues and my church has over 3000 followers.  But if we did, I am sure we would find some alternative.  Of course, no one sprays the stuff while the kids are present usually, unless a diaper change has taken place, but the child is placed back into the mix of kids while the diaper area is cleaned, too.  Don't know if that make a difference.  I am going to address this with our childcare ministry, as I know we do have children in there with serious health issues, and we certainly would not want to compromise their health in ANY way!  The only time I ever had a vapor emergency with bleach, I mixed in some bleach with another cleaner (years AGO) and got a small that stayed with me for days.  I felt I had been vaporized!  But I do know bleach can had serious sides effects mixed with other things, or used straight.  I am VERY careful with it now, but rarely use it too much.  Just the same, it is in my cleaning arsenal.  Nothing I have been able to find to replace it bleaching ability to remove stains, to restore whiteness and to disinfect, all in one.  I have other cleaners that work at these, but none to the degree that bleach does.  But I do keep it for backup only.  I will try other things before reaching for the bleach.  I do know peanut allergy info is on EVERYTHING that might have come in contact with a peanut, but how many people actually have such dire peanut allergies?  Enough that they put it on anything that even came close to the peanut!  What else can be done?  Be an aware consumer, which you are, be a pro consumer, which you are and you don't allow it in your home, which you can do.  Are we missing some other part to this?  Do you think they are misleading the public in some way?  Because I am not sure from your question what you think they are advertising incorrectly?

Several years ago, Consumer Reports warned that the new highest-efficiency furnaces contained a component that would get ruined if chlorine bleach fumes came into contact with it.  Since many furnaces and laundry areas are together in basements, people should research this before buying such a furnace.

FlsrXuJOaa	pansies and violas are very close to each other. They are both cool weather plants that thrive in the spring and fall, but tend to "poop out" and die when the hot summer hits. the main difference between them is that violas have smaller flowers, but there will be way more flowers on one plant.     petunias come in two different types. some that grow bushy and upright and some that spread and will drape over the side of a pot (wave petunias and supertunias). The only problem with petunias is that they definitely attract a few types of pests so spraying for bugs is a good idea.     all of these flowers are lovely and come in many colors. Also they all have a light scent that is really nice. hope this helped!|`|wKQbNvm9aa	Pansies are really violas.  They are in the violet family.

Oq5a5hRhaa	Use organic cotton.    Hemp is the strongest, but it will absorb odors, and can be rough.    Bamboo will prevent odors, and is soft, but it is a very delicate fabric. Your rats will probably destroy it within a day. Bamboo is actually rayon (from bamboo), which is extremely delicate and usually dry clean or hand wash.    Cotton is stronger than bamboo (but not as strong as hemp), and neither prevents nor creates odors. It will also be soft.

ghItgMZxaa	its losing prime, getting air in the suction line before the pump. check the lines for cracks or holes!!!|`|AA10010182	What kind of pump? What application?|`|AA11616515	Bad check valve, possibly|`|vEsSIGfYaa	All previous answers could be correct, BUT  there is another possibility.    IF you have a thin water table, OR the bottom of your well foot valve is only a few inches below the top of the water table, and the flow rate of surrounding water into the small cavity at the base of the well, then...    It's possible that your pump is "outrunning" the ability of the well to provide enough water flow.    If that is the problem then the solution to the problem would be to enlarge the cavity at the well bottom, or to drill a few to several feet deeper to provide a larger containment vessel in which the ground water can pool.
jWtquDVUaa	No, you would have to pull the top up, there is usually two spring clips in the right, and left top corners between the top and the front panel. You would need to push in on them. A putty knife works well. The other way is to remove the 2 screws at the very bottom of the front panel. Either way don't forget to remove the wires for the door switch. Then you will be able to get to all  3 of the thermostats/thermal fuse.

Jh7CmSa8aa	Good Lord...I'm not even going to say anything...    Standard appliance ratings allow for a 10% +/- on voltage.  This means, something that is rated to run on 240 volts can run on 10%, or 24 volts in this case, more or less.  240 - 24 is 216, obviously not within the 208 volts you say you have.    208 volts does come from a three phase system.  However, just because that is the building supply doesn't mean you have three phase in your apartment.  Oft times, three phase power is brought in in order to run mass quantities of motors more efficiently.  You still only have 2 phases in your apartment which may give you 208-215 volts.    Will the oven run on it?  Yes.  Will it slightly reduce the output of the burners?  Only a little.  Will you notice it?  No.    Hope this helps.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Yes it will work and it will operate properly.  The 120/208 is a 3 phase Y configuration from the transformer.  The voltage will impact the heat of your unit.  An engineer could explain why the phase angle of the voltage causes the differences between 208 and 240 volts.  It is explained in the trig functions of how the voltage is generated.  Good luck, have fun.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	"I am lectfrxion"    OMG, LOL.|`|VFmmVHGVaa	Never heard of 208 volt system ,where do you live, you sure its not 220, if it is its ok  t|`|dip4oxB5aa	Optimally you want two 110 hot leads entering the stove totalling a 220 service.  The breakers should be 20 amps each for each 110 hot lead to the stove.  I see two 15 amp breakers used alot in older homes running the two 110 hot leads to the stove.    I dont see a problem with it. What you want is a dedicated circuit where your two 15 amp breakers control only the stove and not anything else in the home.  That way you dont overload the line.    For example you dont want your stove and hot water heater on the same 15 amp breaker.    Your 208 supply is simply two 104 volts hot leads running the stove.  That should be enough to power the stove if it is a dedicated circuit.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	Your living in an apartment building where everybody has a stove.

If you have access to under  your flooring have some one walk above as you try to place shims in between the joists and the sub floor and then a bead of construction adhesive a long there.  Some times the flooring will make noise and baby or talc power spread and "dusted" in the joints helps .  And maybe there wasn t enough cleats or staples used to secure floor..  Was there a tar or rosin paper used between the 2 floors? This is done so that the two wood don t come in contact w/ each other and squeak and also as a moisture barrier protecting the new wood.

yHI6rfeUaa	If you have a 120 V pump, the feed electrical cable should include a ground wire (bare copper or green), a 120 V wire (black), and a neutral wire (white).  The green or bare ground wire should be connected to the ground in the breaker box or fuse panel.  It should also be connected to the metal housing of the metal pump.  If you do not have a ground feed wire, it can be added as either a bare or a green wire from pump to the ground at the breaker box.  It is not considered proper to ground the pump to a secondary ground and often this is a code violation.    If you have a 240 V pump, you should have a black (120 v), red (120 v 180 degrees out of phase with the black), and a green or bare for ground.  In many cases, especially in older installations, electricians used 2 conducter romex with ground and in these cases the white wire is substituted for the red (and in principal the white should be wrapped with red tape near the end to alert you it is not neutral).  Either way the grounding is done as mentioned for the 120 V.    I must stress that it is not good practice and often it is a violation of code to use a secondary ground at the water pump.|`|3W18HDxxaa	a ground wire from the  motor to a ground,    so if there's a short it will take the path of least Resistance to the ground|`|LJM0zMNPaa	The wires going to the pump also have a ground lead in them. That set of wires is typically grounded at the point where they leave the building.  (I'm assumong you are speaking about a well)  Usualy there is a control box for the pump, it is grounded back to the circuit breaker box and in turn the pump wires are grounded thru it.  Eric

Without soundproofing all of these areas you are not likely to be successful.  Nothing inexpensive would work and since it is a rented unit, you are not likely to be able to make the modifications needed.    Were it my unit, and I felt like spending the funds and had the approval, I would use blown in insulation in all walls that face neighbors, the floor, and the ceiling.  After that if noise is markedly still entering via the windows, I would install storm windows.

They also do a powder for desperate measures, but advise to follow with this product, but I can't be buying two when one will do.  Probably find it in your local wash-vac stall in the market.|`|3W18HDxxaa	HOB =stove in the usa    use warm soapy water,|`|YfTk9f56aa	my mum uses flat cola on hers.

Jy15drCtaa	Before toothpaste contained whiteners (peroxide based) this was a decent suggestion. As all toothpastes contain a type or form of silica (a minor abrasive) prior to the introduction of the peroxide (a bleaching agent) this was not a bad route to take. Things have changed since that time.     The best, and only real method, you can safely employ is pumice.  Purchase finely ground pumice from your local hardware store. Lightly dampen a cotton rag and  in a slow circular motion buff the affected area. Do this process in small steps so as to ensure you do not remove too much, if any, of the underlying finish. This will result in a restored finish. You should then reseal (poly/lacquer) the affected area after you are sure the entire surface is dry and clean.|`|VS4C6mChaa	The problem that you describe is not on top of the finish, it actually is moisture trapped below the finish.  You could buff it all day and it wouldn't fix it until you actually too the finish all the way off.  The only way to remove the white stains is to take a rag with some denatured alcohol on it and quickly wipe it over the stain.  What this does is soften the finish just enough to allow the denatured alcoholl to "grab" the moisture under the finish and take it out.  As far as the difference in the sheen level is concerned, this is where you may want to use the pumice or rotten stone rubbing process.  I use rubbing oil and pumice and it gives a nice finish.
UpPWXRK4aa	Omg I don't know if you mean green as in green, environment happy etc, but I had this hippy teacher that told us how he had a "green home" and it sounded incredibly expensive. Everything they did was "green" and it was ridiculous. It sounds nice but if you don't have the money for it I would think it would be difficult. Kind of like eating organic, but on a much, much bigger scale haha.

59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	There are a lot of fig tree varieties that we plant lovers have in our home. Each one of them has different technique to grow.    Here's what you do. I want you to experiment. This is the fun part. Cut one and follow the instruction of the first answer. Cut one more and and put it in a bottle with water in it and put it in your south facing window for more lights. If you noticed the water goes down from the rim of the bottle top it up with more water. Cut a third and stick it directly in a little pot with growing soil on it. You don't need a growth hormone on this one. Keep the soil moist only not soggy wet. Also place it on your south facing window.    On the one you put on water, if you noticed a jelly type or slimy substance coating the soaked portion in the water don't be alarmed. That's normal as long as the water won't get smelly. If some of the leaves fall out that's normal too. It will only keep enough leaves for it to survive. If the water get smelly then it's not good, it got contaminated.Pull it out gently then wash it with running water but don't touch it and then change bottle. If you are successful, you will see at some point some white color break out on the skin under water and soon you will see some new roots coming out. When the roots reach an inch in length then it's time to transplant. You can start in a small pot. Put an inch soil on the bottom of the pot, pull out the plant from the bottle gently then stand it the way you want it and then pour the soil around it gently. Don't tamp the soil there's a chance you will force the soil on the roots and cut them accidentally. Don't stick it on the soil either you will destroy the new roots system just the same. Water thoroughly and then add more soil when the soil settled. There you have a new and fresh plant.    The one that you directly stick on the pot if you are lucky it will continue growing once it stablishes new roots system. It stay dormant for a while though until the roots comes out. It will take a while, so patient is a virtue.. Same thing, at some point it losses some leaves and maybe some part of the branch depending on what you have. It always retain some, and sometimes the whole goes bare but as long as the branch is alive, it's still be okay. If you are successful it will give you new shoots and then more leaves. With all these methods, one way or the other you will get new plants. If you won't get a good or successful results, do it again and again. That's how you learn.    Why do I know these things? I've been doing it for a long time. Actually right now I have a new shoot of a rubber tree sitting on water on my window sill right now. Have fun and good luck.|`|AA10409603	the best way to plant more figs is to cut off the last 8-10 inches from a branch,,  these should under go about 80 hours of cold!!  If it is not too cold where you live you need to put them in the bottom of the fridge for a couple of months,, wrapped in damp news paper!   in the spring you can dip the ends in rooting powder or liquid and plant,, i prefer pots until they get about three feet tall!|`|6uCCu1R3aa	Those shoots (suckers) can be rooted.  Figs don't have rhizomes however.   If the sucker is near or below the soil line, it may develop its own roots. If it is just above the soil, you could try mounding some soil around it for the remainder of this year to see if it roots on its own. Then remove from the parent plant with its roots and plant next year.    If the sucker is growing away from the main trunk of the tree, it may have its own roots you can remove with it.  If you can't get it to root in place use a rooting hormone on the cutting and plants it in a pot with soil mounded slightly.

9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	Based on your question, this is a finished basement.  From that, I assume it will have zero exposure to the elements.  PVC will not conduct heat/cold the same way that copper or iron pipes will so you're really not at risk. Also, remember that basements are typically below the ground level which means its usually several degrees warmer than the outside temperature in the winter.  Your main concern should be those areas where the pipe will penetrate the exterior walls.  If that is not going to happen, you should be in good shape.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	PVC doesn't sweat like copper  so really there is no need to.  On the other hand, if you use a lot of cold water in the summer, watering lawn, filling a pool, for the small expense you should insulate the cold water pipe.  You know the saying, better safe than sorry..|`|vEsSIGfYaa	IF either hot or cold pipes will be exposed to freezing temperatures then both types should be insulated.    If the basement will not be allowed to develop freezing temps then it is not necessary to insulate.    On the other hand, IF you insulate the hot water pipes then there will not be as much heat loss while the water is traveling through the pipe from the water heater to the point of use [shower, lavatory, sink, etc.].|`|hOC1Wrbhaa	if the pipes will be inside the finished portion of the basement, insulating them is not needed.  if they are outside your finished area, then i would insulate them from the water heater on, both hot and cold...

Please Add more details to confirm and I will get back to ya PDQ.    As far as making a decorative guitar I have a few Ideas:    make a skeleton out of popsicle sticks:  for the bottom, lay them out on a table flat and in a vertical position and kinda make a barcode picture of sticks in the outline of a guitar. next hot glue two rows of sticks ~1" away from each other and keep going to form the bottom of the neck. next out line the edges in sticks (or whatever). Brown cardboard backing. Do the same for the front, but with a sound hole. Add decorations as needed. to give it some width, go to Lowes and get a few slats of white pine 1" thick.  I'm sure you have a saw. Cut the boards into 1" sections (doesn't have to be exact). glue, with elmers school, in areas to the bottom about every 3 inchs. Let glue dry for 4-ish hours. place glue on tops and lower top on. Put a book on top for pressure. let dry. use cardboard or whatever to enclose the sides. for the wire, you can actually buy guitar strings or while you're at Lowes pick up some copper wire.    That took too long to type so you'll have to ask for more ideas.      EDIT: I like the cigar box guitar. do that.

If I can't open a jar, I'll usually tap the lid lightly on the edge of the counter top.    However, to get back to the physics of your original question...  Assuming its a metal lid, you don't want to use cold water.  Cold makes metal contract.  So even though you wouldn't be able to see the difference, the metal would contract and get even tighter around the lid of the jar.  Conversely, hot water should make the metal expand ever so slightly and (theoretically) make it easier to open.      Safety note:  Be sure to use a towel on the lid after running it under hot water. 1) You don't want your hand to get burned; and, 2) You can't twist a wet lid.|`|bSEuEvCSaa	it is supposed to be under warm water.  i always hit the lid in about 3 spots with the back of a spoon.   works every time :)|`|hOC1Wrbhaa	just take a knife edge and slide it under the lid, that will pop the seal...

58029617786d57a90a92287b80d7824baa	The first thing you should do in turn off the electricity on the line by flipping the circuit breaker.  Remove the plate from the receptacle.  Remove the two screws thal hold the receptacle to the box.  Pull the receptacle out of the box as far as you can.  there should be three wires attached,black,white and bare copper.  Note the way and where the wires are attached (on older receptacles the wires are wrapped aroun a screw,on newer ones they are just plugged in the receptacles ).  Disconnect one wire at the time and attach it to the new receptacle.  Plug a lamp and flip the circuit on.  If the lamp light up,disconnet the breaker again and reattach the receptacle to the box.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Turn off the power to the outlets, remove the old ones, install the new ones in a neat and workmanlike manner.  Then turn the power back on. Simple and easy if you know enough.|`|owMQ8jTcaa	First things first you need to plug a lamp or something into the outlet, then find the breaker that controls that outlet and turn it off. Once you are sure that the correct one is turned off you can proceed with removing the cover plate. Under the cover plate you will find 2 screws, one at the top and one at the bottom, remove them. Carefully pull the outlet out of the box, pulling the wires with it. The wires will be either screwed to the side or pushed into the back. Compare the outlet that I assume you have already purchased to be sure that it is an equivalent replacement part. Now it is just a matter of swapping wires from one outlet to the other. If the wires are pushed into the back you will more than likely have to cut the wires and re-skin it. If the wires are screwed to the sides just loosen the screws enough to get the wires out. If you have more than one wire at each connection point it may be less confusing to move the wires from the old outlet to the new outlet one at a time. When that is done, don't forget to connect the ground wire to the outlet. This will be the bare wire. It is very important that the outlet is grounded. Be sure that all your connections are tight and carefully push the outlet back into the box. Screw the outlet back down, you may not have to screw it all the way down, it is normal for it to sit somewhat loose in the box. Put the cover plate back on. When all this is complete, turn the breaker back on. Test the outlet. Good Luck!|`|AA11621776	turn off power at breaker and remove x-2 making sure that the black are on the right [ small side of plug] whites on the left [ larger side of plug]|`|C5UUltHtaa	Yes make sure power is off to the receptacles. Can be a pretty shocking experience.  Best way to do it is remove cover and then the 2 screws holding the receptacle and pull it out as far as you can without disconnecting the wires.  Next take your new receptacle and remove one wire from the old one and install it on the new one one the matching screw. Do one wire at a time so you have it connected exactly the way it was before. You may see 4 wires connected to one receptacle and the other only 2 (not counting the bare ground wire) because it may feed other receptacles in other locations.  The thing to note here is the white wire should connect to the silver colored screw and black to the brass colored. Polarity is important for safety reasons.  Make sure connections are tight then push the new receptacle in place making sure it's centered good and replace screws and cover.  Sorry, I don't mean to write a book about it but I'm trying to make this short without forgetting anything.  Hope this helps.
