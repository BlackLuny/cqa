Erst dann gebe ich die Gewürze dazu, weiters eine Zitronenspalte und eine Orangenscheibe und gie?e mit hei?em Wasser auf. Es ist auch wichtig, das Paprikapulver nicht anbraten zu lassen, da es sonst bitter schmeckt. Nachdem ich mit Wasser aufgegossen habe, stelle ich den Topf mit Deckel ins Backrohr und lasse es dort noch eine Stunde langsam k?cheln. Das gibt immer eine wunderbare Sauce. Willst du die Sauce noch etas s?miger machen, kannst du gegen Ende der Kochzeit einen L?ffel Maisst?rke, den du mit etwas Wasser anrührst (damit es keine Klümpchen gibt) nachhelfen.|`|sNKIgEnjaa	Das Fleisch sch?n lange anbraten.<br>  Danach das Fleisch rausnehmen und viele Zwiebeln (ich nehme soviel Zwiebeln wie Fleisch - gibt auch eine leichte Bindung, wenn sie verkocht sind) in dem Bratensatz anbraten.<br>  Danach (eventuell Karotten ) und  unbedingt Tomatenmark dazu und weiterr?sten.

N53iI8weaa	Out of the eight questions, I'll answer only one and that's only fair!    Plain water or add dilute juice: I would have thought adding dilute juice to water would end up with something tasting like nothing only more so - a rather pointless exercise - or did you mean add a cordial to dilute it IN water....|`|a76b38d0164ef927c918e56023d08abeaa	In the UK all of the tap water is safe to drink and dose not need to be filtered and is just wonderful, it is safer than some bottled water. You should drink a minimum of 2 pints a day.|`|HKaMsKltaa	water is the best just and it is the best drink for u !!!|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	All right, I'll have a go at your list!  - It's personal preference, plain or with a little juice.  The juice will add calories, but also sometimes nutrients (depends on the juice).  - Many or even most of tea's health benefits are negated by adding milk.  Maybe try to find a tea you can drink without milk.  As to whether hot water and milk is good... I don't know, if you like it I guess it's fine.  - Studies have shown that filtered water is healthier than tap, it really depends on your region, and you probably can't get a straight answer from anyone.  Most of the water I drink I make into tea, and it's been boiled.  I make my juice concentrate using water that's been boiled and cooled.  If I could afford a reverse-osmosis water treatment, I'd probably have one.  But for a healthy person, tap water is probably fine.  - when they say 8 glasses of water a day, they mean 8 oz. glasses.  But most doctors are saying that's too much, particularly for smaller people.  You get a fair amount of water from foods and other liquids.  I would think that 4 8 oz glasses (or cups of herbal tea or something) would be plenty if you're eating a regular diet.  But check with your doctor.  - If a particular area says the water is unsuitable for drinking but you can wash in it, then obey the restrictions.  I would think the reason would be obvious:  something has to have a higher purity level to be taken internally.  - If the water doesn't clear up in a minute or two, don't drink it.  Sometimes water is cloudy at first because of tiny air bubbles, but if that's the case it will clear very quickly.  - Yes, the water sources change within our country.  They are local to the area and there are differences from region to region.  The tastes do change.  All should be safe, however.|`|BGIsuNMTaa	If possible just have water as it has no added sugar, no calories and is healthier for your body and your teeth.   By not adding a teabag, you're just watering down your milk and it will curdle.   Water is better as this helps your body function and wash toxins out but you need to have a glass of milk a day as well for calcium which helps your bones.   half a pint is the reccommended amount when reffering to 8 glasses, so 4 pints.  Sometimes this is because that is what the religion and culture believe.Others may be because the water is dirty  Cloudy water indicates dirt so ensure when using tap water, you run it a little first then fill your glass/bottle up.   Yes, some water in other countries is not filtered and clean like in england so will taste different and be quite dirty which is why it is advised to buy bottled water abroad.  In england water may taste different in different areas as a result of more alkaline or acid in the rainwater that is collected.|`|vw7ebwgnaa	Milk gives you calcium (which helps your bones) and water helps keep your body hydrated. So you really should have some of each! Drinking water straight out of the tap is fine, as long as where ever your water comes from has no known contaminates in it. When they say 8  glasses, I assume it means eight regular sized kitchen glasses (when you have a set, not the little ones but the next size up). Cloudy water seems a little bit sketchy to me...I'd stay away from that...|`|iFCBEZW7aa	Plain water is better, however dilute juice is fine.  The tea bag makes the flavour.  No water is better, health and i dont like plain milk.  Tap water is fine, but filtered can taste better and more filtered. Tap water is filtered lots anyway, just depends on the condition of your taps.  1.8 litres of water per day, not sure what size glasses though.  Well cleaning yourself isn't letting the water into your system, because sometimes the water isn't filtered enough to drink.  Cloudy water is not great for you, filter it.  Yes, some places have softer or harder water, some may tell the difference, i can't though.    Hope i helped you out!|`|bbn2YvrKaa	wow, that's a lot of questions! I'll do my best!    - plain water is just fine- some people like to add flavour to it but it's just as good for you and you don't get the extra sugars and calories from the flavourings  - people enjoy tea, so they use the teabag.   - milk has calcium, which is good for you, but you really just need about 3 servings of milk products a day- so some milk is fine but water is good too.  - most cities have excellent quality water from the tap, but some people prefer to filter it for taste reasons.  - a glass is usually considered 8oz  - in some places the water is not good for drinking, but using externally is fine (washing, cleaning, etc.)  - depends what is making it cloudy... not usually a good idea to drink it if you don't know.  - water tastes different based on the natural minerals in it, as well as what is used in the purification process (ex. chlorine)    Hope that answers some of your questions about water!|`|RJpekNPfaa	Plain filtered water is best. Add a slice of lemon or lime for an extra zest is fine.    Water from the tap is normally foul, so I filter all my water through a Brita jug first.    Hot water with the juice of a freshly squeezed lemon is very good for you first thing in the morning upon rising. This is recommended by naturopaths the world over.    No, milk is not better than water:    http://www.notmilk.com    Eight glasses of water normally means two litres of water  250ml glass X 8.    You can normally purify most water by boiling and then cooling it and people often take water purifying tablets when they go camping into the wilds.    Often water in cities is hard water and water near pristine mountains is soft water. The taste is very different.     The best water I have ever drunk was soft water in the Scottish Highlands. The worst water I have ever drunk was hard bore water in the Australian outback.     .|`|qcyFExz9aa	Im not 100% sure if they do this where you live, but most tap water everywhere has been fluoridated.Which is poison. www.flouridealert.org . Don't use tap water. If you're going to be using water, use only water that has been through reverse osmosis.  Not all milk is good for you. Depending on where it is coming from. If the milk you are drinking comes from a cow mill, it's likely you will be drinking a lot of really disgusting stuff you don't even realize. For example, in cow mills, the cows are not treated humanely. They are pumped full of steroids and chemicals to induce more milk production. Causing them to become ill often, leading to them being given antibiotics. So, for starters there will be chemicals, steroids and antibiotics in your milk. Secondly, they machines they attach to their udders are often uncomfortable and rough on the skin. Due to prolonged use their "teets" will often become cut and infected, leading to pus.. in your milk. Not a pretty thing. BUT, good news is not all grocery stores get their milk from mills. I know in the US that is mainly where they're getting it from, however in Canada, there are very few. In the UK, I would imagine the same.   Cloudy water (unless you mean bubbles) = foreign somethings in your water. Don't drink it.    Before you thumbs down me for this answer research what I've said, there's a wealth of evidence.

qzWBykzgaa	Cooking causes foods like fruits and vegetables to lose some of their nutritional value (vitamins, etc. ) The heat destroys many of the valuable nutrients, so yes, it is better for you to eat raw vegetables and fruits.

Vegetables are a raw food, what category of raw are you talking about?    Okay you have defined it a little further. As you know things like carrots, broccoli, cabbage, tomato etc etc you can eat raw, cooked processed. When you come to your Swiss chard, and other deep greens, best steamed to retain the nutrients, same with potato, parsnips and alike. So what I am saying to you they are okay both ways in essence.

Put one half circle on each end of the square cake so you have a long oval.  Frost green all over, then brown for the track on top, pipe white icing around the inside and outside edges of the track.  You can easily find other racetrack type decorations (like flags, etc.)  for the cake at a cake decorating store.

Three of my fav's:    Recipe  1  Roast Beef Pinwheels  4 large slices medium-rare roast beef  1/2 cup cream cheese  1-2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, or to taste    Whip the cream cheese with a fork until soft. Stir in the horseradish. Spread the cream cheese mixture evenly over the slices of roast beef. Starting at a narrow end, roll each slice tightly and wrap individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. To finish the Pinwheels, unwrap the rolls and slice into 1/2 slices. Arrange them on a serving platter. Makes 36 to 48 appetizers.   Notes:   1. Using horseradish sauce in the Roast Beef Pinwheels recipe, rather than straight prepared horseradish, cuts the zippiness but, also, the flavor of the recipe a bit.     Recipe  2  This one is even easier and very good.   2 pkgs of cream cheese  1 can or Rotel  1 pound of spicy sausage browned.    Place all ingredients into crock pot ( do NOT drain the Rotel) and melt. Serve with tortilla chips. Transport after melted in crock pot, reheats quickly at the party.

Then when you go to recook it , it' s mush . Everything else freezes very well and recooks nicely .|`|zawmsUO1aa	These don't freeze well:    Greasy foods (They just become greasier.)  Cake icings made with egg whites  Cream fillings and soft frostings  Pies made with custard or cream fillings  Fried foods (They tend to lose their crispness.)  Fruit jelly on sandwiches may soak into the bread.  Soft cheese, such as cream cheese (can become watery)  Mayonnaise (It separates; use salad dressing instead.)  Sour cream (It becomes thin and watery)  Potatoes cooked in soups and stews (They become mushy and may darken. If using potatoes, cook until barely soft and still firm; then freeze quickly.)      These change during freezing:    Gravies and other fat-based sauces may separate and need to be recombined by stirring or processing in the blender.  Thickened sauces may need thinning after freezing; thin with broth or milk.  Seasonings such as onions, herbs and flavorings used in recipes can change during freezing. These are best added during reheating to obtain accurate flavors.  Vegetables, pastas and grains used in cooked recipes usually are softer after freezing and reheating. (undercook before freezing, or add when dish is reheated)  Heavy cream can be frozen if used for cooking, but it will not whip after freezing.  Some yogurts may suffer texture changes.  Raw vegetables lose their crispness, but can be used for cooking, stews, etc.  Many cheeses change texture in the freezer. Most hard cheeses turn crumbly (which makes them okay for grating, but not for slicing)      More tips on freezing food and frozen assets can be found here, you'll have to scroll down:  http://www.stretcher.com/menu/topic-g.ht...|`|OROx5M5laa	Vegetables and meat typically freeze well. And you are right, things with eggs in them won't reheat well. Beans also come back to life well after frozen, as does rice. Usually noodles don't reheat well after frozen unless its a lasagna or something where the noodles are covered.
52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I would prefer it!!! It's nothing to stop by a store and pick up a bottle however, to have some that he spent time and trouble to make it would be much preferred. You should have tried some of my uncle's.. He grew muskidiines (sp) special for it. BTW he grew the first seedless watermelon and all sorts of things. He ran the UofA experiment station  His tasted great and had a serious kick.. .  I know that Belle would have liked it. It's very Southern...|`|k6CSa9caaa	No, its cool. Can we all have some? lol|`|QvF8dR7Taa	no its about one of the best gifts you can give,if the wine is as good as you say.i have had wines made by a lot of different people and it seems they use better stuff than a regular winery does,almost all of them didn't have that bitter after taste that commercial wines do,that's because commercial winery's squeeze the seeds and that's where that bitter taste comes from|`|AA12064771	Not at all tacky. Free aclhool? Im there!    My anniversary is tommorow. Send some over!      =D|`|AA10834367	Absolutely not...homemade spirits like wine, beer, cordials and others make excellent gifts. I too make wine. I grow my own grapes (Catawba, Niagara and Concord) and so far, I have been VERY pleased with them. I also make several fruit wines. I would have to admit that a strawberry-rhubarb wine I make is defiantly a hit with the kin folk. I've been making wine for about 5 years and I am still mixing and matching fruits. Every batch is different, and that's what my family like about it. I also make beer, and a big hit in the fall is my pumpkin ale. People often ask me..."How do you know if your wine is good enough to give out". I always tell them..."If it's so good I can get drunk on the stuff, and not get a hangover, then it's good enough to give out".|`|E2Bdez4Iaa	No.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	Absolutely not. Today's marketing tricks try to make us think that only hicks give homemade things as gifts. I say homemade things are the nicest gifts that can be given. Maby not a homemade TV you see, but something made with your hands is a wonder full gift!|`|sKDje0osaa	so long as it tastes good|`|vppuNux4aa	no at all it is a gift from the heart anyone can buy a bottle of wine   the true gift is the giving of yourself and every bottle has your hubbys gift in it|`|zawmsUO1aa	Homemade wine is an excellent gift.    You could run into trouble if you tried selling it, but giving it away is perfectly legal.

AA12307584	This is the one my family loves.    3lbs beef sliced thin  1 large onion sliced thin  1 green pepper and 1 red pepper sliced thin  2 cans mushrooms   drained  1/4 cup soy sauce  1/2 Tablespoon granulated garlic  1 box broccoli cheese rice    cook meat in a little oil about 10 minutes, add onions and peppers cook on low heat another 15 minutes or until veggie are tender, stirring often. add mushrooms, soy sauce and garlic. simmer another 5 minutes.   Cook rice as directed on box. Serve stir fry over the rice|`|2b7ErdOqaa	This is the standard information I generally give for my stir-fry recipes. The sauce is what does the trick and the rest is up to you.    Most fresh veggies will work well in a stir-fry. Here are some simple combinations that always go great:    Onions  Carrots  Celery  Pea Pods  Bean Sprouts  Broccoli  Cabbage    You can get creative and add things like    Bok Choy  Savoy Cabbage  Bamboo Shoots  Mushrooms  Water Chestnuts  Zucchini    And the list goes on.    The meats are also up to you but chicken and pork always go well together. You could use in your stir fry:    beef strips  pork strips  chicken strips  shrimp  scallops    Any leftover meat you have that you can slice would work in there. Just add it at the end.    And, if you want to make the best sauce, here's what to use:    1/2 cup boiling water with 1 tsp chicken base (like a bouillon cube but moist)  2 "glugs" of soy sauce  2 "glugs" of oyster sauce  1/2 tsp ground ginger  black pepper to taste  5 drops sesame oil    Mix all that together and sprinkle it on your veggies as they cook. Remember not to overcook the veggies. Always start with the veggies that take the longest to cook. Things like pea pods and bean sprouts are always the last to go in.    Once all the sauce is added, to thicken it, mix 1 tablespoonful of cornstarch with some cold water - enough to make a thin paste. Move the veggies over and add a little to the broth in that area. It will start thickening up pretty quick. Stir it around and do it in another area until all the sauce is glossy and coating the veggies (don't do too much, though). Be sure to cook your noodles until el dente in a separate pan and add just before adding the cornstarch.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Prep Time: 10 minutes  Cook Time: 10 minutes  Ingredients:  4 cups cold cooked rice  8 ounces cooked chicken (or substitute cooked turkey, etc.), chopped  2 eggs (more if desired)  1/2 cup green peas  1 medium onion, diced  1 green onion, diced  Seasonings (add according to taste):  Light Soy Sauce  Oyster sauce  Salt  Pepper  Oil for stir-frying, as needed   Preparation:  Beat the eggs lightly with chopsticks, add a dash of salt (Add a bit of oyster sauce if desired).    Chop the chicken meat and dice the onion and green onion.    Heat wok and add oil. When oil is ready, pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the wok and cook over medium heat, turning over once.  Cook the other half the same way.  Cut the egg into thin strips, and save for later.    Stir-fry the onion on high heat for a few moments, remove and set aside. Do the same for the green peas.     Add oil, turn down the heat to medium and stir-fry the rice.  Add the soy sauce, salt, pepper and oyster sauce.  Add the chicken, onion and green peas and combine thoroughly. Serve chicken fried rice with the strips of egg on top and the green onion as a garnish. (Alternately, you can mix the green onion and egg in with the other ingredients).
0af16f1ee8293214149e5b2f3b51184eaa	People always think souffles are super delicate, but that isn't really true. Like a sudden loud noise will deflate it or opening the oven will deflate it, which isn't true.  You can open the oven maybe like once or twice. But souffles take 20 min tops and it will be done baking.    The reason why it could be collapsing is because...  You didn't butter the ramekins enough. It should be buttered inside and the rims.  You didn't rest your base long enough in the fridge   Or you didn't whip your egg whites to stiff peaks or you over folded it.    Here's my recipe   http://www.grouprecipes.com/86310/liqueu...    good luck. :)|`|FegAXbgiaa	I found this site that gives great advice on how to stop your problem : )    http://almostvegetarian.blogspot.com/200...    from this site    Make sure you whisk your egg whites to a good, stiff peak to create lots of air bubbles. Arm tired from all that beating? A copper bowl, a pinch of cream of tartar, sparingly wiping your bowl with a bit of white vinegar can all help. So, too, can a patient husband with a strong arm. Or a KitchenAid. And make sure to fold, not stir, those egg whites into your batter so as not to deflate the air bubbles you worked so hard to make.  Pay attention to the heat of your oven. Ideally, get a few oven thermometers and place them around the interior of your oven. This will help you to tell what is really happening in there (I always have to set my temperature 5 or 10 degrees higher than the oven indicates because my oven runs cool). Souffl are like fussy children: Not warm enough, or too warm, and they dont cooperate.  Pay attention to the cooking time. Not long enough, and you have soup. Fallen soup. Too long, and you have a dry and flat dessert. Which, too, will be fallen. You can tell if a souffl is properly cooked if a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (just like with a cake) and the top is lightly golden brown.|`|2b7ErdOqaa	Just wanted to clarify something.  When you make a souffle (one you eat hot - not a dessert souffle), it must be served immediately from the oven - no delay.  If you wait 10 or 15 minutes before serving, it will definitely fall flat.  So make sure everything else is ready before you take the souffle out of the oven.    Now if you're saying it falls flat while still in the oven, then your other answers may be more of what you are looking for.    Learned from experience.  Also, souffles are a little difficult to make.  I've heard people say one time it comes out great and the next time it's not right - with the same recipe.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	You have to open the oven door REALLY slowly. Sudden cold will deflate it.|`|XAAF7R23aa	you must be opening the oven to check it to soon.|`|fBW54cAraa	Go to YouTube and search for "Quantum Foam" to view the Good Eats episode on souffles for a complete tutorial.  Here's some tips.    1. Use the right container for baking    The best baking dish is a round ceramic one which will radiate the heat slowly and evenly into the souffle, so that the eggs don't set too soon or too late.    2.  It needs something to climb.    Your souffle needs something to grab onto so it can rise properly.  Use room-temperature butter to lightly coat the sides of your baking dish, then spread a rough-textured ingredient over the butter, such as grated cheese for a savory souffle, or cocoa powder for a sweet one.  Then cover with plastic wrap and stick the dish the freezer for 5 minutes.    3. Be careful with your eggs    Over-whipping or under-whipping the eggs can cause problems.    Oh, and everything everyone else has said so far about keeping it warm is right.  Never open the oven door while it's cooking.      Here's Alton Brown's recipe:    http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton...|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	I believe a pinch of cream of tartar helps stabilize things - did your recipe call for that?|`|YQTBQ5xyaa	Maybe you are not folding in your egg whites correctly.  Did you let them whip to stiff peaks?|`|YVSidhrfaa	You have not got the temperature high enough, and on taking it from the oven it should not be in a cold draught. From oven to table in a warm room. Perhaps you are using a small fan assisted electric oven...always a pain because although it can deliver heat to the food, as soon as the door is opened it disipates. Back to cast iron gas!

k5zvA1X9aa	Whiskeys I recommend on the rocks or neat:    Bourbons: Wild Turkey (way better than Jack), Buffalo Trace, Bulleit Bourbon, Stranahan's, Makers Mark.    Scotch: Bowmore, Glenlivet, Glenfiddich, Balvenie, Macallan's, Speyburn.    Pretty much any barrel aged bourbon or scotch is going to be decent. With Scotch most of the time, but not always, age improves quality. Single Malts are better. With bourbons teh big names (i.e. Jack Daniels, Wild Turkey, Jim Beam) make craft batches for the connosieur.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	hmm..jd is the only good whiskey. my friends that liked jd also used to drink a lot of SoCo, Jager, and captain morgan. :3  they used to drink a loooootttttt|`|CGnL2nS0aa	Wild Turkey is several stops BELOW Jack Daniels.

SHRKIJxkaa	to make it http://www.geocities.com/bhenwood_2000/r...     preserve it  * You can sterilize jars by putting them in your dishwasher on the "hot" cycle.  * Rings and jars may be reused. Sealing lids must be replaced, since the soft sealing compound deforms with use.   * Discard any rings that are dented or overly rusty.   * If you're reusing older jars, visually inspect them for cracks or chips. Run a finger gently around the rim to make sure it is smooth and undamaged.   * Keep jars sterile until they are filled by placing them in a 300*F oven on a baking sheet lined with a terry-cloth towel. Remove one at a time as needed.   * "Open-kettle canning," a once-popular method of sealing jars by inverting them so that the hot contents create the seal, is not considered safe. Paraffin methods are also questionable. It is best to use metal lids and process the jars for the recommended amount of time in a boiling water bath.   * Home-canned foods can harbor deadly diseases if they spoil or are mishandled. Always process foods for the recommended duration, clean and sterilize jars properly before use, and discard any jar of food that is not sealed. Also discard any jar with contents that smell wrong or appear moldy or discolored.   * Avoid placing cold glass into hot water or vice versa. Sudden temperature changes can shatter the glass.   * Do not attempt to double the recipe for jam or jelly. If you have multiple batches to do, do them separately. Doubled batches may not set properly.   * While you might save jars from purchased products that fit a canning jar ring, real canning jars are best. They are designed with thick enough glass to withstand repeated processing and hand canning. Use those saved jars to store dry goods or your penny collection, instead.|`|pdQwQ6X3aa	Go to cookingnetwork.com and search home made jam and if that does not work go to google.com

Price fluctuations in the market for marshmallow as a cow feed haven't been tracked since the original Mickey and Minnie Mouse went into retirement.  They vary far to much between the opening and the closing of the bell, plus there isnt any after hour trading here in the United States.  The only place that I know of that currently is placing marshmallow in dairy milk is Marshmallieu, France.  My sources tell me that investing in French marshmellow futures isnt a good thing though, as the cows are beginning to die off of starvation.  It seems as though French cows are not able to chew marshmellow very well and it sticks to the walls of the cud.  Plus their utters get clogged and require consistant human intervention to suckle them open again.  The French Embassy in Washington tells me that because of better Health Care in the Middle East, that the elder humans that use to be toothless to do this job, are now getting dentures at a government subsidized lower deductible and consequently are retiring earlier than forcasted.  Alas, we American marshmellow addicts would do just as well by eating MilkyWays to alleviate the painful withdrawal symptoms associated with mallow addiction replacement therapy.  That product combined with an ongoing counciling (ie; 12step) has been shown to have positive results in Phase III trials on Monkeys.  No human testing has been done yet, therefore there is no conclusive evidence that either pregant mothers or those lactating will not harm babies....cj|`|gMYYzLP4aa	good question.

cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	This is a cream tomato soup recipe. I use canned tomatoes (as per the recipe), but you could probably use your roasted tomatoes if you add a little tomato juice (as the canned tomatoes should not be drained).    Ingredients:        * 4 tablespoons butter      * 1/4 cup chopped onion      * 1/4 cup chopped celery      * 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour      * 3 cups milk      * 2 teaspoons sugar      * 1 teaspoon salt      * 1/4 teaspoon (scant) ground black pepper      * 2 cans (14.5 ounces each) diced tomatoes, undrained      * chopped basil leaves or fresh grated Parmesan, optional    Preparation:  In a large saucepan, heat butter over medium-low heat. Add chopped onion and celery; cook, stirring, until tender. Stir flour into the vegetable mixture, stirring until well incorporated. Gradually stir in milk and add the sugar, salt, and pepper. Continue to heat, stirring, until the mixture thickens and begins to boil.    Dice tomatoes smaller or puree in a blender or processor, if desired.

Plain and simple.|`|2b7ErdOqaa	My hubby eats low carb so I make Mock Potato Casserole with the cauliflower - kind of like a variation on Twice Baked Potato Casserole.    1 head cauliflower - steamed until tender  1 lb bacon - diced and cooked or cooked and crumbled  1 c shredded cheddar cheese  4 oz cream cheese  2 T butter  1 stalk green onion - diced    Mash the cauliflower and add the cream cheese and butter.  Mix well.  Add the cooked bacon, cheddar cheese and green onion and mix well.  Cover and place in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight to meld the flavors.  Bake in a 350o oven for 35-40 or until the cheese is bubbly.     I serve it every Thanksgiving and my son and his family will eat it over the mashed potatoes and gravy - saving the spuds and gravy to take home.  They don't get the Mock Potato Casserole because hubby refuses to part with those leftovers.  He'll even give up the turkey but not the cauliflower.    Enjoy!|`|dSkQkIS6aa	I love roasted cauliflower.  It really brings out the nutty flavor and you won't believe how delicious it is.  Here's the simple recipe:    http://www.youvegotsupper.com/recipes/Ro...
Ny79udz1aa	Lazy way to cook pork(and lamb). Crackling; very important. Score with a really sharp knife, right through the rind every 1/4". Rub in some salt and sugar, and put into the roasting tin on a bed of thickly sliced potatoes, some sliced onions, and a few garlic cloves in their skins. Tuck some sage leaves under the pork roast, splash the whole lot with a wee drop of olive oil, and put into an oven preheated to 230c for 15/20 minutes. That gets the crackling going. Now turn the oven down to 150c, and go out for a few hours. Come back when you like, and it will pull  apart with a fork. You don't need to do the 230c bit with lamb, just 150c and go out for the afternoon. (I forgot, and my son and I did that very thing. We came back, expecting the worst and the house wasn't full of smoke, and the leg of lamb was perfect. Since then, pork too works just as well we've found).|`|hKlsJgVSaa	I make up a rub of seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, tiny bit of cumin, and chili powder. And soemtimes a bit of brown sugar.    Rub into the meat very well. and slow roast at no higher that 325, no lower than 275 for a couple of hours until it is fall apart tender.    Or try this recipe. It is pretty darn good.    Heavenly Harvest Pork Roast:    1/4 cup pomagranite juice  1/4 cup sugar  1 tbsp salt  1 tbsp granulated garlic  1 tbsp steak seasoning  1 tsp black pepper  1 pork roast (4-5) pounds  2 pears, cored peeled and sliced thick  1/2 ornage peel on, sliced thick    Heat the pomagranite juice and sugar until the sugar is dissolved, pour into the bottom of the crock pot.    Mix the salt, granulated garlic, steak seasoning, and pepper. Rub all over pork, then lay the pork on top of the juice in the pan. Turn once so that it is coverd in the juice.    Cover the pork with the pears and oranges. Cover and cook on high for 6-8 hours or until tender. Serve with juice and fruit slices.|`|xdUjRxKzaa	Great - open it up and stuff with bread crumbs, lightly fried shallots and sage. Truss it up with string and roast on high for about 30 mins and then turn down the heat to around 200. The temperature and the timing depend on the weight of the joint. Serve with apple sauce and whatever else you like but if you like potatoes dauphinoise go onto James Martins web site he has an absolutely fantastic recipe for this which you 'pan fry' and it takes less than 30 mins and tastes like heaven!

0HfhltzZaa	240 f? Are you sure that's the temp? Most glass bakewares are safe to temperatures up to 450 degrees (check with individual manufacturer's recommended guidelines). The only time these aren't safe is when these dishes go through temperature shock. Like, for instance, taking a casserole dish straight from the refrigerator or freezer and sticking it straight into a hot oven. The rapid temperature increase cracks glass and when it's extreme, can shatter pretty fast. Here are some safety tips from pyrex.com:  NEVER use on top of the stove, under a broiler, in a toaster oven, or place over oven vent or pilot light.   AVOID severe hot to cold temperature changes, including:   DO NOT add liquid to hot dish   DO NOT place hot dish or glass cover in sink   DO NOT immerse hot dish in water   DO NOT place hot dish on cold or wet surfaces   Handle hot ovenware and glass covers with dry potholders   ALWAYS add a small amount of liquid to the vessel prior to baking foods that release liquids while cooking.   DO NOT overheat oil or butter in microwave. Use minimum amount of cooking time.   DO NOT use or repair any item that is chipped, cracked or scratched.|`|OROx5M5laa	I've never heard anything bad about baking with glass, I've only heard negative about baking with plastic.

Pyrex is the best.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	Double check that 240F isn't 240C. If it is F, then no it isn't safe.  Cakes want temperatures of 350F-375F (180C-190C)    240F wouldbe for warming something, not cooking.    If it C, you could cook almost everything in it.  240C = 470F|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Glass/pyrex is safe to 400; but I never use it above 375 anyways:) ... However, glass conducts heat differently than metal.  You usually need to lower the oven 25 degrees from the temp that the recipe calls for.

m1cEbzBcaa	its a tough one  even wikipedia doesn't have any listing of a history of it    likely nobody knows
ToztjpAsaa	There are some great traditional British dishes that would easily stand alongside the best of continental cuisine.  All those pies and puddings, though, can be a bit stodgy.    The problem, I think, is the standard of cooking in the average home which, in my view, is very poor.  Look at the proliferation of ready meals in supermarkets.  This sort of thing would be unheard of in the equivalent French supermarket.  It seems nobody cooks anything from scratch any more.  We kid ourselves that pouring a jar of artificially coloured and flavoured gloop over a packet of frozen stir fry vegetables is cooking.    Perversely, our TV screens have never been more full of celebrity TV chefs showing us how to construct the widest possible variety of meals from quality ingredients.  Yet hardly anyone ever bothers to try and cook them at home.|`|6PQOjBrYaa	concerning traditional british food ,it certainly is. overcooked ,no spices or salt. every bit of taste gets killed with vinegar or tomato sauce. ham and bacon is way to salty. food is a necessity not a pleasure thing on this isles. the entire range of english food is entirely there to make you miserable. happy rich english people wont touch it . every restaurant tries to come up with some version that combines exotic seasoning with  a batch of traditional cousin.  well there is always the indian,chinese,thai,turkish etc food readily available.  i happen to like spicy food.|`|AuGE08Rjaa	no it is the opposite, i have live in the UK for 14 years now and the food is of a much higher standard than it is in the states|`|pSNex1a1aa	British food is good for your info.

The food is wholesome and just what it should be for the weather we have.  It basically needs more care in preparation and adding a few spices and herbs to lift the traditional fare to its utmost best.  I am British but not English/Scottish/Welsh or Irish.  I still cook traditional British fare my husband is English    Although there is a lot of criticism of our cuisine our deserts are famed throughout the world particularly our puddings|`|YVSidhrfaa	In Britain it is possible to source extremely good food at very low prices but not from the ubiquitous supermarkets. The Supermarkets are feeding the public tortured chicken fed on dubious diet, yet from any shoot in Britain you can buy, in feather, pheasant, duck, partridge for less. I buy large cock pheasant plucked, gutted and delivered for 3.50!  The quality compared to a "chicken" is astounding. Similarly for duck, rabbit, hare,and partridge.  Scotland is lousy with red deer, absolutely free-range and economic.  (just go for the shoulder not the haunch.)  So it is for fish...Britain is surrounded with showls of mackerel and herring, any small fishing village is happy for you to take them away. So too are the hedgerow full of blackberries, sloes, damsons, crab apples, wild garlic, sorrel, wild fungi.... the beaches covered in delicious seaweeds, mussels, limpets, wild oyster. You can live as a King!  Because of urbanisation the British feel food comes in packets from supermarkets. Not so in Eastern Europe, France, Italy, Spain, Greece. So in Britain there is wonderful food...but the British don't eat it! Discerning educated ladies prefer the FARMERS' MARKET to walking the countryside with a basket and taking natue's bounty!  My tip: contact the secretary of your local Farmers Union and ask where is the nearest shoot, the secretary and phone number. Drive to you nearest seaside and discover the pub of the inshore fishing boats. Fraternize and buy pints!   Buy a fieldguide to wild edible plants of Britain.  Good luck, and eat extremely well, healthily and cheaply in Britain!|`|9XZ67Umcaa	Well I have no idea how it tastes...............but who in there right mind would want to eat something called.............................drum roll....

I could go on..and on...  What's so awful about them? Some of the best chefs and cooks in the world are British and generally the standard of British cooking is pretty good.  And may I ask why you think "extremely dubious cafes and restaurants" are particularly common in Britain? All places where food is prepared and served are subject to regulation and regular inspection so I would think standards of hygiene and cleanliness are probably better than many places in the world.

oBXiigEoaa	I recently found this website on Youtube, and I have yet to make any of his recipes, but they look legitimate and very good.     http://www.youtube.com/user/vahchef
WVP1v18Raa	The following is a recipe for making "Challah", the bread that is used on the Sabbath and at most festivals. You would make two loaves before the Sabbath would begin. This is because there is to be no cooking on the Sabbath, so one loaf is for Friday and the second loaf is for Saturday. If you are going to have guests over, then you may need to bake more, or use this for the ceremony. You can also freeze this bread ahead of time, but be sure to wrap several layer's of foil and plastic. It heats up nicely in a microwave for about 20 seconds, and my husband loves the French Toast from it! You need about four hours in the refrigerator or until the bread rises to the top of your large bowl. I usually make my bread on Thursday night just before I go to bed. Then when I come to the kitchen at 3 p.m., it is ready to braid. If I don't need two large loaves of bread then I will sometimes turn the extra dough into a wonderful pizza dough! If I am using the recipe for only pizza it will make three large pizzas that are delicious! I usually top with Monterey Jack cheese, Mozzarella cheese, bell peppers, and Vadalia onions! You will love this sweet pizza taste! Oh, yes! My husband loves it when I make the cinnamon rolls for Saturday morning out of the recipe, too, instead of the second loaf of bread!<br>  <br>  2 cups warm water or milk<br>  <br>  2 pkgs dry active yeast<br>  <br>  6-7 cups bread flour<br>  <br>  1/2 cup sugar<br>  <br>  1 t. salt<br>  <br>  1/4 cup oil<br>  <br>  1 egg<br>  <br>  Directions for my challah bread:<br>  <br>  1. In large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water (careful of the temperature or it won't rise. You can use a thermometer to check the temperature. You want 75-120 degrees.) Stir in sugar and salt. Add 3 cups flour and mix well. Add oil and egg and mix well. Then add remaining flour. (The dough will be a little sticky but don't add more flour.)<br>  <br>  2. Wet a clean dish towel and ring it out. Cover the bowl of dough with the towel. Put the bowl in the refrigerator and let stand overnight.<br>  <br>  3. When dough is doubled in size braid as follows:<br>  <br>  Divide the dough into 3 pieces. Cut 1 piece into thirds; with your hands roll each piece into a 16 inch-long rope or snake. Place ropes side by side and braid as you would hair.<br>  <br>  Pinch ends of braid to seal. Place on cookie sheet the bottom loaf. Repeat with another piece for another loaf. Cut remaining dough into 6 pieces; roll each into 17 inch-long ropes. Braid each set of three ropes as shown in figure; pinch ends to seal.<br>  <br>  Place each smaller braid on top of a large braid; tuck ends of top braid under bottom braid stretching top braid if necessary.<br>  <br>  4. Arrange loaves at least 5 inches apart on oiled or greased cookie sheet; cover and let rise in warm place until doubles in size. (Depending on your house temperature. Find a warm place.)<br>  <br>  5. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cook bread for about 35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven and brush top and sides of loaves with butter. Let cool on wire rack.<br>  <br>  Too busy for all that? Then read this Super Jiffy 2 hour method that I discovered: *If you are like I was, you have a problem with finding a nice warm moist place to get the dough to rise. One day I even tried the inside of my dishwasher! (Don't try it, okay?) BUT the best idea that I have found is the microwave! Here's what I do. I make half the recipe at a time, okay, if I use the food processor. The trick is to really dissolve the yeast - so I use my mixer or food processor and beat it until it foams up tall. Then I add the sugar and mix it well until I know that it is dissolved well. The mixture is VERY foamy by this time. Then I add the ingredients until I have a stiff dough (I have bread hooks on my mixer, and use the cutter down in the bottom of the food processor) When I am ready to let it rise, I take a wet towel and put it in the microwave to heat for about two minutes. MAN! It is hot when you take it out! Then I put it across the top of the dough bowl, and set the bowl in the microwave with the door shut for 30-60 minutes...just long enough to rise up to the top of the large bowl. Works great! Then as I begin to braid the bread I turn on my oven to 350 degrees to warm the top of my electric stove (those of you with gas stoves have a pilot light for this purpose). I place my cookie sheets (I love my airbake cookie sheets for this project!) on the top of the electric burners (they are not turned on!), braid my bread, and heat another dry towel in the microwave to go across them while they rise again. My bread is huge and beautiful! Just remember that the secret is having a nice moist place to raise the dough.

Whatever you're doing, if you don't know it, you will either end up failing out or being fired from a job so keep that in mind whenever you ask for help -- it really is asking for someone to help you understand something, not for the answers.

C] converted to sugar, then ferented into alcohol    See how yeast have to convert sugar into alcohol via fermentation, the starch from barley needs to be converted to sugar first.

A five ounce glass of red wine has the same alcoholic content as...  B] 24 ounces of beer    Since 2.5 ounces of 80-proof spirit is the same straight and in a cocktail, this makes choices C and D the same. Thus you cannot pick either one.  By default this must be choice B, although even 24 oz of light beer will have as much alcohol as 8oz of wine.    14. Table wines have an alcoholic range of ____ percent.  B] 8.5 to 17  --Just kind of learn this.  8.5% is common for a Rieseling.  17% is common with red Zinfandel, maybe some Cabernet Sauvignons.    19. What's the difference between brandy and whiskey?  D] whiskey is distilled from grain; brandy is distilled from grapes  --Scotch comes from Scotland.  American whiskey includes Jack Daniels, and every bourbon.  It also includes the less popular rye whiskey.  Brandy is distilled wine, whiskey is closer to a distilled beer made without hops (though in bourbon, the "beer" is actually made from corn, which makes it nothing like beer so we call it a "mash").

This is palette-inspired, and American styled.    I remember a very, very crisp pear that was pealed and cored.  Rice (seasoned) is traditional, and it compliments the rice that you may be using in the sushi.  Use some leafy vegetables for both aesthetics and tastes, but not something like cabbage or lettuce.  A meat like steak, sauted and tender (but a little tough, just a little), in strips, will give a nice accompanying texture and flavor, and give a nice contrast to the bundled soft sushi (unless you're talking about the soup).  It also gives a nice aroma, if you know how to dress it.  Add in some nice wine (depending on your and your company's tastes), a juice or tea, and for desert have a (visually pleasing) custard or pudding.    Here's what I'm working on for my wife for Valentine's dinner.  I have a friend (Brady) who is a professional culinary master!  Seriously, this dude rocks.  Anyway, here's my (so far) line-up.    Beverage-  A fine wine which fits the dining party's palette  A sweet juice (mango, peach, pear, apricot)  A white or green tea, slightly sweetened to the party's palette  Main course-  Sushi (wrapped, seaweed or whatever)  Peeled and cored pears in some sort of finely served form (with a dressing basically)  Steak strips, saute`ed, tender but with a /slight/ bite necessary  Bowl of seasoned rice  Egg drop soup  Leafy vegetable (not cabbage or lettuce, aesthetics mainly, but edible)  Desert-  A custard or pudding with a nice visual appearance  Music-  Soft ambient tones with a slight nature noise in the background  Lighting-  Visible lighting, white and peach tones, green accents      That, Ma'am, is my recommendation if you're looking for a nice night of fine dining, using sushi, but not completely limiting yourself to traditional roles, and thus limiting your palette.    My best advice is to find a professionally trained chef who has attended a good institution and ask for advice.  Brady will be advising me on my selections to refine them better later.

Jvx5I6ADaa	No. What it means is that it makes veggies taste better. You just don't eat the whole thing of dressing you eat veggies with it. So it helpstowardd your five a day portions of veggies.|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	I don't think it would count as 1 whole serving, maybe just half a serving.     ? CupCake ?|`|LLBxpMc7aa	I don't think it would count towards an entire serving of veggies. But, its tomatoes, so I'm sure it does help|`|bLlV8k19aa	I am pretty sure it doesn't count as 1 of your 5 a day, because Heinz would write one of your five a day, obviously to make more people buy the product. So they can't lie, so it must count towards your five a day.
UoGFo3Dhaa	It doesn't have Red Wine in it...  It is Red Wine.  It is a longer process.  Grape juice is left to ferment.  You get wine.  Continue the process it becomes vinegar.    Like apple juice, to apple cider, to apple cider vinegar.|`|FpT7x2VVaa	yes, it is actually wine allowed to become vinegar. as in everything, there are good ones, really made the old fashioned way, and cheap mass produced vinegars, which have undergone a highly industrial process, rather than slow fermentation in barrels.   there are wine vinegars available which compete in price with the high end wines.|`|bC0KRacHaa	Nope, but it was made FROM red wine.  The only vinegar that wasn't produced from a consumable alcoholic product is balsamic vinegar.  But vinegar of all types is non-alcoholic.|`|UY2MJtfGaa	No, it is *made* from a red wine.  The fermentation process is allowed to continue past the wine stage to the vinegar stage.|`|CKfU6etmaa	Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine. so red wine vinegar definately has red wine it it!  also, the longer the red wine matures, the better tasting it will be!
AA12094101	Try replacing red meats with fish like salmon or steelhead trout, ground beef with turkey, white bread with whole grain bread, whole or 2% milk to 1% or skim milk, a less sugary breakfast cereal, and supplement this with a more active lifestyle. Any type of crash diet at your age could do serious harm to your growth hormones.  Also, drink more water and cut soda and most juices from your diet.|`|NkN4HoFpaa	Try to eat pineapple and watermelon,they are natural diuretics.Eat salad with low fat dressing,drink lots of water,drink green tea(it speeds up your metabolism).And invest in some apple cider vinegar tablets,they help you lose weight,and they are safe to use.|`|480a2d1883220b8938b7bad7068d460faa	SLIM-FAST  is a good source of  VITAMINS, CALCIUM and NUTRUITIONS  a growin' body needs.|`|2177c3b6a733d6203b3b437576a129eeaa	DONT EAT|`|AA11871235	For breakfast have cereal,egg on toast [1 slice] always have something for breakfast.

AA10133345	When I quit smoking (three years ago) I realized that the hangovers I had always(?) gotten were from the cigarettes...on a typical night out, I would smoke 1 + packs(!) a night...and a bad hangover was always inevitable....I hads always assumed that it was the alcohol, but once I quit smoking, the hangovers (for the most part) disappeared!|`|HcIgpJMtaa	Yes definitely, I used to get them all the time before I quit smoking. I think that most of the hangover effects were caused by too many cigarettes rather than too much beer.  I still drink and I don't feel nearly as bad the next morning now that I've quit smoking.|`|26b8dd547ab70bedaa82eb8a867cc12daa	Thats too long for a cig hang over. Before I quit in December it did happen occasionally but from lack of sleep.|`|SOpFKoImaa	Yeah.. weeds give a hangover!|`|9ee31f6ad55abff4de3f8f5aaae5508daa	Sounds like you nearly OD from too much nicotine.   You might even be allergic to it as well.    A friend of mine is allergic to tobacco only when she smoke a cigarette, she is not bother by the cigarette smoke itself.      She said that when she used to smoke cigarettes she didn't understand why she was always sick and she said she would get some really bad headaches.|`|364ac5f499e2d1255dfd719a0c565db2aa	Totally agree! That was me NYE. I went 3 days without a ciggie but then fired up another.....|`|4ddf617539dcc969339e71f2d7531b26aa	ahh a few drinks and too many cigs, remember those  younger days very well. I do believe that cigs can attribute to the crappy feeling you have the next morning, and too much nicotine will cause a headache.  I have gone a whole day without smoking when this has happened to me. Now that you have gone this long, it is a good time to quit.

Clases de caviar    Beluga: huevos grandes de color gris claro - negro, frgiles y bien separados. Son del pez de agua dulce de gran tama?o (8 metros y 1 tn de peso ) que lleva su nombre. Es el ms caro.    Osetra: huevas de menor tama?o que el anterior de color amarillo dorado tirando a marrn de sabor afrutado. Este caviar es un poco ms barato que el anterior.    Sevruga: huevas peque?as y de un color gris claro - oscuro de textura cremosa. es el ms abundante y el menos caro.    Espero te sirva la informacin.

El esturion es un pez que se encuentra, sobre todo, en los mares del norte. Es caro porque como buen pez, nada ms tienen crios una vez al a?o, entonces es dificil de recolectar, ya que unicamente el esturion hembra, (evidentemente) es quien lleva en sus entra?as la hueva y hay que capturarlos antes de que deshoven, desgraciadamente el pez cuando le extraen la hueva, (caviar), muere.

Mix it with some club soda (in the spirits/wines/beer section, not soda section of the market) or sparkling water. It won't be as sweet, but you can still bring it back. Tastes great too! Soda is already too sweet anyway.|`|AA11560792	No ..but try some selzer water... i dont know if it works but hey you cant hurt already flat soda so give it a try  ....Good Luck..

Finely dice the jalepenos. Mix everything in a bowl and let sit in the fridge for about an hour to let the flavors meld. If you like it creamier, put it in the food processor. I personally like it chunky. You should put one of the avacodo pits into the bowl also. It will help prevent the avacodo from turning brown.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	mash the avocados with lime or lemon juice and a bit of salt! That is the simplest of guac recipes. (lime or lemon juice prevents the darkening of the avocados)    You can then add garlic, salsa, tomatoes, or whatever else you want to make it more interesting.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	I just take 4 avocados, and mash them.

Add in with 2-3 ripe avacados mashed a little lime juice and seasoned salt. Delish!!!|`|FcZU29W6aa	Mash 2 avocados.  Then mix in 8 ounces of cream cheese -- have the cheese at room temperature and it will mix easier.  It is best to just keep mashing this mixture with the back of a fork.  It won't all be completely blended and you'll have small white pieces but this actually tastes very good.  If you want it completely blended, use a blender.  After you've mixed it to your liking, add a pinch of salt and a small pinch of garlic powder.  Mix that in and refrigerate or serve immediately.  |`|hHCdXq0Naa	Just mash some ripe avocados, and add a little salsa to it (fresh or jar).....

It has a rooster on the bottle)  You could also use Tabasco or whatever pepper sauce you have on hand.    Add a small squirt of lime juice    Adjust ingredients to taste after everything is combined if need be and serve.

uh8DTrIpaa	Definitely you need to start with meal planning.      A good way to do this is to write down what you have for dinner every night, even if you eat out.  That will give you some idea of the kind of thing you want to make.  Ask your husband to tell you some things he likes that you make.  Don't worry about being creative, just get a week's worth of meals on paper.    Next, you need to make sure you are buying real food, not convenience food.  Whole veggies not pre-chopped, no meal kits, none of the prepared foods from the deli, etc.  You need to cook from whole food ingredients like veggies, fruit, pasta, meats, and stuff like that.  One thing you can do to make that easier is make a few things ahead on the weekend, like tuna salad for lunches, or side dishes, or chopping veggies for use later in the week.    You can look at sale flyers from the grocery store before you plan your menu.  Then you pick recipes based on what is on sale.  If you want to stock your freezer, you will certainly want to do that based on the sale flyers.  You are stocking ahead, so you can wait until different things go on sale and buy a bunch then.    Make sure you keep a list of what you have in the extra freezer, so that you don't forget and end up with 40 pounds of hamburger and nothing else.    Try to plan breakfasts and lunches, too, although you don't need to be as elaborate on that.  Also, try to cook so that you use up what you have--shop in your pantry before you make your grocery list.  Be especially careful with fresh fruits and veggies, you don't want to be throwing food away.  Frozen veggies are a good, cheaper choice, too.  They are just as nutritious as fresh, but they are often cheaper, and you don't have to worry about using them as quickly.    But menu-planning is the big key.  If you know what you are making, you don't buy a bunch of extra stuff.  That and not using convenience foods.  Good luck!|`|14K1Vt3Paa	It's a good idea to watch the newspaper ads from local super markets. The specials vary between stores and you can realize some real savings by picking up one or two extras of groceries for your freezer or cupboards. |`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Interesting Question!! I go online to each of my grocery stores and stock up whatever is on sale that week!! $300 is alot!!! Wow!!! I though $75 a week was high!! LOL    Online -printable coupons. I print them every week and stock pile everything too, LOL Especially search for those brands that you DO use, most of them have coupons!!! |`|byScRN6baa	buy in bulk when you can and from wholesalers  buy sale items even if you dont need that week  use coupons (i dont) but you could save alot of money  if supermarket has savings club card get one - i save about 40-50 weekly    find coupons online for baby products|`|ScaWGPFSaa	plan your meals for each day of the week before you go to the grocery store. then only go to the store once a week and buy everything for the entire week then. when you go more than that, your tempted to buy more than you need. My family and i go to the store once a week using these methods and only spend about 210 a week to feed 5 adults.     Another tip is to NOT buy the most expensive food.. my sister inlaw spends about 400 a week on food for her ,and her 2, 11 and 1 year old becuase she buys organic everything.. |`|1en1Jtp4aa	brian and then ben franklin|`|YpbK15yZaa	I found a helpful article...hope this is what you're looking for...    http://lifehackery.com/2008/10/09/life-1...|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Mikki  Here are a few ways to save money.

AA10418424	Sometimes you can get them from the company that makes the bread maker either by contacting a sales representative, email or 1800 number. If the product is old they might be able to tell you where you can find parts to it. Beyond that, if the product is old or out of production then you are on your own. Sometimes you can find these things at garage sales, craigs list or some other affair.|`|Jvx5I6ADaa	Have you tryed Willams and Sonoma? They have a bunch of cooking utensils and alot of machines like a bread maker. Also you could try bed bath and beyond but i am not sure you could find one there. You also could just search it up and find one on the internet.
CXOs4mAEaa	I cant find anywhere,except for restaurants...
5zNwBQZHaa	Of course they aren't still good.  Throw it out.    Unsafe food is not easy to detect by appearance and smell alone.  By the time food looks or smells spoiled it is WAY past the safe time to use it to eat.    We can't see or smell things things like e.coli salmonella and listeria - common bacteria that can be on foods that make us sick - so you can't tell if meat is bad just by looking at it.    This is why it is important to monitor the temperature of food that is stored and keep track of how long it has been there.    Food in the fridge should always be kept at 40 degrees or less.  Holding times vary from food to food but the FDA recommends that beef cuts be kept in the fridge no more than 3-5 days.   After that - toss it out.    Here are some videos on food safety: http://www.ific.org/videos/askanexpert/b...    Here are the FDA recommendations for how long to keep food in the fridge: http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/fttstore.h...

LLeQyWGcaa	i would say 3 cups|`|hmKEHofzaa	well the way i figured it out was    1 1/2lbs=24 ounces(16 oz in a lb 8 oz half pound)  1 cup=8 oz  24/8  =3 cups|`|N53iI8weaa	In American theory it's three cups - but cups are a measure of VOLUME not WEIGHT which is what YOU want !|`|36a3ynpJaa	2 and half to three cups depending on how much fat is in it.  It will be more in volume with more fat since fat is not as heavy as meat.  I'd say 3 cups for 70% and 2 and a half for 90% meat.
Ht0oAffsaa	what we do sometimes is cook different things. sometimes its fun to get your friends over, or go to the store and get stuff together for a dinner. any kind of chicken is pretty fair priced, and usually pretty easy to fix a TON of different ways. that would still let you all hang out, have a few drinks while everyone is helping to cook, then you could do your movie or have your night or whatever. pastas are good too, and are quick and easy to have.    good luck!!|`|ygimTNzoaa	I guess KFC. That's all I can really think of though. I get their honey drenched honey BBQ popcorn chicken. But you litterally pretty much have to take their hand and show them how to do it because they CAN honey drench popcorn chicken with no problem, but I guess no one asks for them so they always give me the sauce on the side which sucks. I WANT HONEY BBQ DRENCHED. Maybe it's to much trouble lol. Sorry. I like the Jalipeno poppers(cream cheese) in the frosen isle in the store they're great and never to hot. I'd get a bunch of thoes guys like thoes too.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Order Chinese.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Chinese food  Pizza Hut has Pasta  Make your own pizzas  How about making dinner?

bbn2YvrKaa	if they don't contain meat, then they would be ok as far as i know.    they probably contain various chemicals and herbs and spices that imitate the meat flavour.
DFXS4SB4aa	If there are, I'd love to know...It would be a lot nicer than just having to scrub them with steel wool and AJAX...those were some awful days at culinary school...But we got those nasty looking pots and pans to sparkle...we were just covered in the grease and in pain.
cGYJq3Udaa	CHICKEN CARBONARA  Grilled Chicken Breasts, Alfredo Sauce, Bacon Pieces, Pasta    Alfredo Sauce is a white creamy sauce:  You can buy a jarred sauce of it at the market  A packaged Mix----Mccormick Creamy Garlic Alfredo (very good)    or from scratch:  These recipes are very good and easy!!!

Add butter.      STIRRING frequently, cook on medium heat until sauce comes to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Sauce will thicken upon standing.) Serve over pasta.     Chicken Carbonara: Stir 1? cups cooked chicken strips and 1/4 cup crumbled cooked bacon into prepared sauce.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Saute whatever veggies you have in olive oil with garlic and oregano, basil, rosemary, salt & pepper. Toss with the hot pasta ... you can add Parmesan cheese if you like|`|wgJDkQhTaa	Add some Pasata to some mince and season it with a bit of salt and pepper. Pasata on its own is awful, very tomatoey. But the addition of salt and pepper makes it quite nice.    My favourite is Carbonara. Creme Fraiche (or either single or double cream), some bacon, onions and mushrooms, and a dash of white wine makes it a lovely meal.|`|AA12065689	Mushrooms, all the peppers, onions , tomatoes, some spices, olive oil, and any pasta sauces , green chilies.single cream   put oil in the deep pan , put dry coriander once the oil is slightly hot , than when you have chopped onions put the onions in, than cut to motes and put that in mix it well. start putting all the ingredients in the pan and mix it than put other spies inside once you have done that  get your pasta ready , once you think ever thing is ready mix ever thing than pour the cream inside and cook it gently  don't forget too add salt and pepper .    hope this helps,    enjoy and think about me whilst you are eating|`|iEsICA3Maa	You can make Ham Carbanara  Just cook up some Penne pasta, and put it in a large bowl.

Mushrooms seriously ruin this dish.    Ok you've got your cooked spaghetti.  Whisk up some eggs add them to the spaghetti, stir over a very low heat to cook the eggs through a little.   Then add some cream (single or double depending on how healthy you wanna be really).  Add bacon (fried or grilled again depending on how healthy you're being)  Add italian herbs, pepper and salt.  Add plenty of cheese (I think cheddar is best but you can go stronger if you like).  Make sure it's warmed through enough, and you're done!  Serve with salad.
C3LiKhm8aa	First, make sure you are filling the cup measure for the flour properly.  The proper way to do this is to fluff the flour with a fork, then gently ladle it into the cup.  A cup of white flour should weigh around 4 3/4 ounces.  The most common mistake that new bakers make is to pack the cup of flour, which gives them entirely too much flour in the recipe.  If you have a scale, use it.    Second, make sure you follow the instructions carefully, especially to make sure you have it set on the proper sequence.    The proper proportions for French bread are that the weight of the water should be about 62% of the weight of the flour.  The weight of the salt should 2% of the weight of the flour.  The weight of the yeast should be 1% of the weight of the flour.    Unless you've had the yeast for long time, the yeast shouldn't be a problem.  What you described is a typical result of too much flour for the amount of water.    There are two sources, one for French bread and one for troubleshooting your bread.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Try adding a half cup of mashed potato flakes to the recipe.  The water has to be warm like bath water.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Use milk or powdered milk - 1 tablespoon of powdered milk for every 3 cups of flour makes a huge difference. Also, the recipes that come with bread machines are generally not that great.     Here's a recipe I"ve made 3 times since November - makes good loaf-bread and good buns for hotdogs or hamburgers. (use the dough setting, let rise 1 hour. Shape into buns, let rise again and bake. Yum)     http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/Reci...|`|bbn2YvrKaa	did you measure your ingredients exactly? sometimes that makes a difference. too much salt can make it tough. too much flour can make it dry and dense. not enough water can do the same thing.    was your yeast fresh? dead yeast will not rise.    did you use bread flour?    if it's still not turning out, you can try adding a little bit of gluten flour to help make it more elastic. (just a little, like a teaspoon or less)|`|BhFeii5Xaa	http://www.hillbillyhousewife.com/breadm...    This lady has some really cool suggestions on how to use your bread machine to best advantage.
l2BjWA5Baa	Yes! That would be pretty cute :]  Be super careful that you don't fill it more than 2/3 full or it may overflow during baking, and check on it every couple of minutes because it'll cook way faster. It's done when a toothpick comes out clean and it's spongy to the touch. Oh, and don't forget to grease the pan well.|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	Yes, as long as it is oven proof. I cook little chocolate fondants (which are basically cake on the outside) in ramekins. It will work just as well.|`|bbn2YvrKaa	definitely. it will probably bake a little quicker though so keep a close eye on it.
m1cEbzBcaa	looking on their website, and wikipedia, and google shopping, i can't find any US location that seems to have it.    I would say its doubtful its available in the US... likely its either not exported, or at least not imported to the US.
