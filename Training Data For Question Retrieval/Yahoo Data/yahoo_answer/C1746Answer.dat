Just think, soon after 911 the controversial film about Arnold going into Colombia came out.  Pretty cathartic remake of "Let's Get Harry", a late seventy film about a soldier left behind.  <br>  The Bush policy was pretty gun ho, mission accomplished and all that.  Public sentiment for the war began to wane after the casualties kept mounting, the poor armor came to light, and the issues of torturing were brought to the forefront.  <br>  Don't get me wrong were there are constrained films there are good films.  For example "The Bourne Ultimatum" sheds a lot more light on how to go about proving things yourself than "Fahrenheit 911" (Both Good films).  <br>  However this transcends into all media.  I used to be able to call into CSPAN out of Bridgeport,CT and get on with relative ease.  However after my journal and album were put in the hands of the media I've heard bash songs from the likes of Sante Gold and I have not had one successful attempt to get on CSPAN since.  It rings and rings and I am sure they have caller ID.  That program concept was created in 1979 by media outlets to provide viewer interaction with issues of the day.  However if you really closely monitor the programming it is actually more cathartic mixed with swallow your medicine.  <br>  Like my friend told me if you want to lie to them show them the lie in plain media and they will absorb it.  We all absorbed the huge impact of 911 and despite the tangible proof for reopening the case everyone seems pretty complacent. <br>  Shows like 24 make us seem pretty capable fighting terrorists when the actual realities are that home advantage and superior urban guerilla tactics are exploiting American soldiers.  Why did the media not mention the inter-operability problems between the global hawk and the predator missile system, to mention two.  The valuable time loss provides insurgents a modicum of time to escape or hide in tunnels.  I recall getting on Cspan during 04-05 to discuss that. <br>  I will leave you with this, during 1987 the movie "Predator" came out.  That same year the basic current platform of the Predator missile system was brought to production.  How does the media influence the way we think?  I wonder...
aLNLl482aa	Do you know what I think Gillon? i think it's up to 'us' and no-one else to tolerate this sh1t.<br>  <br>  If 'we' as a community refuse to tolerate users who are malicious then what can they do? They lose all their potency.<br>  <br>  I have witnessed the most appalling accusations and slander directed at someone who I am close to. Up until this point I am heartily ashamed to say I just ignored the majority.<br>  <br>  I hope legally there is some redress for people, How does anyone know the mental state of those they bully and harass? I am NOT talking about Oms here but how does anyone know if your hounding and defamation won't drive someone over the edge?<br>  <br>  The other aspect I would like to raise is some bullying towards Oms was very subtle and 'behind the scenes'. Sly digs but a building attack. Many maybe only saw his final reaction to all of this when he reacted to all the personal comments directed at him...to view that episode or any of his knee jerk reactionary comments is GROSSLY UNFAIR.<br>  <br>  All the people who I thought were worth a carrot have come out tonight and spoke up against all of this....for weeks I have sat back and watched the injustice of all of this and been made to feel like some sort of deluded person. The main perpetrator was just accepted and carried on regardless. Going by the mails I have received tonight MANY felt the same as I. <br>  <br>  <br>  IF you know someone is capable of continued and sustained attacks on individuals then YOU SPEAK OUT. Arguments and run ins are totally different - yes they can smolder for weeks. But to set out to target someone for no reason other than your own pleasure...what is that if not a bully?<br>  <br>  So just for my own personal take on recent events and what I know now....NOTHING anyone can say to me will ever change my loyalties once they have been won because I don't give them easily. Omstarts is one of the brightest, funniest and loveliest blokes on this entire site- that he didn't handle the full on assault of his character and name is of no detriment to him.He's worth ten of all those who attacked or doubted him.<br>  <br>        “That laughter costs too much, which is purchased by the sacrifice of decency” <br>   Quintilian quotes <br>   <br>  <br>  Sorry to use your Q as my final swan song on this matter Gillon...Haz is now officially putting all of this crapolla to bed.

The people or persons creating all the grief need to realise that what they are achieving is a bad reputation and ill feeling for themselves.<br>  <br>  Being bullied is never a good situation to find yourself in, whether that's online or in real life.

I sometimes wonder the age and mentally of some who persist in such attacks on others.....is their life that sad that the only enjoyment the get is to bully people who go on a website out of personal choice. As for the age well SADLY and this is VERY sad, the majority that do it are ruddy adults!!!|`|OWIiJMLqaa	First off, cyber-bullying is nothing more than words on a screen and the "victim(s)" inability to deal with it. You put it in the perspective of the atrocities that occur daily around the globe, and you soon realize that their are much bigger fish to fry. There can never be true legislation for anything that takes place on the global scale, who would enforce it? Any law enacted would be a toothless tiger. It is up to the individual sites to police themselves, and ban offenders. This is what's happening now, and for the most part it works. Hackers are criminals and are subject to prosecution, but the vast majority of bullying does not involve hacking systems, so it should be a provider/user relationship. Ask the kid in the Sudan who had his parents murdered in front of him how well international law works., the UN might care that user X is harassing user Y, but they can't prevent or even punish mass murder so what makes you think there is a solution to the relatively minor problem of cyber-bullying, beyond what is being done already.

The film tells the story of the violence and blood shed that can be expected when civilized society is deprived of necessities such as food, water, or energy supplies.  It is an orgy of violence and bloodshed that present day  Californians should be thinking very seriously about.<br>  <br>   A January 17, 2009 story in the Los Angeles Times  by Evan Halper and Patrick McGreevy is headlined “California controller to suspend tax refunds, welfare checks, student grants.

0JL3Mg78aa	A "paycut" won't help some of these companies but it's an important symbolic gesture (and they all have taken cuts).  It's not the company itself but the economic impact a shutdown would have--the automakers are just TOO big and affect at least 10 million jobs directly and indirectly (the auto workers have buying power and the companies that depend on that buying also go under).  Also, the industry is concentrated and too much of a shock overall. <br>  <br>  I don't think anyone likes it, but the US has chosen to focus on the financial services industry, which in part drives the US economy.  Allowing THAT sector to fall would have a ripple effect and truly drive this country into recession, probably taking many of our allies down as well.  <br>  <br>  I personally think that all these big companies should be broken up and allowed to rebuild--instead the banks are trying to consolidate even more.

The USSR and the USA!<br>  But something changed all that when the USSR went to war with Afghanistan.<br>  Eventually it left the country broke, and they went into a deep depression that taxed the people to their limit and the death and  carnage left them without any respect for the government who sent those young men to die.<br>  <br>   Some small municipalities decided they wanted no more of the government tax and spend on a war which they did not want in the first place.  So a civil war broke out and some of these places succeeded from the Union.  Some of them are now small countries with their own government, who never fully recovered from the poverty that was brought on by that war.  Today there is no more USSR and it is a nation in poverty hardly a major power as it once was.<br>  <br>   They just keep picking away, with a terror attack here and one there. until they destroy a nation.  They are relentless, because it only takes one man to keep a bunch of women pregnant and raising men to fight and that frees the rest up to continue the battle.  Which they have so successfully done for at least the last 2000 years.  Then there is Africa?  The Islamic forces marched down from the North and have pretty much killed anyone in their path.  Africa has seen the worse genocide in the history of the world.<br>  It makes Hitler look like a peaceful man.  Have they stopped?  Not anywhere in the world.  They have a civil war going on in Pakistan, India and between Israel and surrounding nations.  <br>  <br>   So when we are all Muslim then the war will stop and only then?  Not hardly during the 1980’s they had a ten year war between Iraq and Iran in which over a million died and billions in property damage.  Both sides were Islamic.  Hussein gassed the Kurds who were the same religion.  It is very hard to fight a religion that tells a man and convinces him that when he dies in this war he goes to heaven to have 70 virgins forever.  The best thing to do is leave them alone.  Let them kill each other.<br>  <br>   Now we face some important facts in the USA, it is going into a very deep depression due to the economic drain of the war.  Which has been very unpopular.<br>  People have lost sons and daughters and husbands and fathers to this war which seems to never end.  Some states cannot pay their bills and are about bankrupt and the other states are not anxious to bail them out with high taxes and government spending.  Texas has declared it wants to succeed from the Union and Louisiana wants to join them.  Saying we do not want stimulus money but we do not want to pay taxes to pay for this either.  Oklahoma and New Mexico will go along with anything that happens in Texas.  They are basically all the same state.<br>  <br>   You have to wonder when Louisiana Republican Governor says it is a land in chaos that means it is in chaos. When they do not want any part because it is to wild that is like the governor of Indiana saying that man is to corrupt for Chicago.<br>  You know that man is corrupt.  They have even elected a president Chuck Norris is going to be their new president.  Imagine that guys they are predicting the new battle ground will be fought in Arizona and they will become their own country.<br>  Texas isn’t kidding.  It has always been thought of as its own country.<br>  So the war in Iraq has delivered us to what Russia faced a few years earlier.<br>  So should we stay until the civil war breaks out here or get out of Iraq?

The fundamental moral and philosphical basis for the support is explained very well in the article A Nation Like Ours: Why Americans stand with Israel by David Gelernter, referenced in the Sources section at the bottom of the page. On a practical level, the following sections review various dimensions of the US support.<br>  The US was the first country to recognize Israel, only minutes after it was officially created in 1948, consistent with a 1922 Congressional resolution backing the League of Nations mandate for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Since then, the two countries have developed a rock-solid friendship that does not depend on the parties in power either in Washington or Jerusalem. While there have certainly been ups and downs, the basic bond between the US and Israel, the only country in the Middle East that resembles the US in its values and democracy, is very strong. Both countries have long-recognized that their mutual interests of deterring war, promoting stability and eventually achieving peace are only possible if the United States continues to stand firmly behind Israel.<br>  In the United Nations, the United States did not cast its first veto until 1972, on a Syrian-Lebanese complaint against Israel. From 1967-72, the U.S. supported or abstained on 24 resolutions, most critical of Israel. From 1973-2000, the Security Council adopted approximately 90 resolutions on the Middle East, again, most critical of Israel. The U.S. vetoed a total of 33 resolutions and, hence, supported the Council's criticism of Israel by its vote of support or by abstaining roughly two-thirds of the time. The United Nations has been generally hostile to Israel and often the US was her sole defender in the world body. Israel has returned the friendship by voting soldily with the US on virtually all issues.<br>  After Israel became an independent country in 1948, the United States joined an embargo on weapons sales to Israel, the 1949 Tripartite Agreement on weapons. Although the US sold hundreds of millions of dollars in weaponry to Arab states during the 1950s and early 1960s, there were no sales to Israel until 1962 when the US agreed to sell to Israel its first significant American system, the HAWK anti-aircraft missile.<br>  American military involvement with Israel remained sporadic until the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Following an Egyptian refusal to accept a cease-fire and a Soviet military airlift to the Arab states, the Nixon Administration sent a United States airlift of weapons and supplies to Israel enabling her to recover from earlier setbacks. Starting on October 14, 1973 US Air Force "Operation Nickel Grass" flew resupply missions to Israel for a full month.<br>  As a direct result of the Yom Kippur War, the United States quadrupled its foreign aid to Israel, and replaced France as Israel's largest arms supplier. The doctrine of maintaining Israel's "qualitative edge" over its neighbors was born in the war's aftermath. This was based both on US appreciation of Israel's role as a defender of Western values in a generally hostile region, and also on the Cold War calculus of opposing the Arab client states of the Soviet Union.<br>  In the following decades, Israel and the US worked together to counter the greatest threats to American interests in the Middle East. These threats include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by rogue regimes; state-sponsored terrorism; the potential disruption of access to Middle East oil; and the spread of Islamic adicalism.<br>  Cooperation has extended to programs for sharing cutting-edge technology and valuable intelligence; conducting joint military exercises; researching and developing new weapons; establishing joint anti-terrorism strategies; and pre-positioning materiel in Israel for use in the event the US ever needs to respond quickly to a future Middle East conflict.<br>  In the 1990s, Israel and the US collaborated on a theater ballistic missile defense system, the ARROW, vital to Israel to defend against missile from nearby hostile Arab countries. Israel's missile defenses were integrated with US capabilities, including enhanced interoperability and upgraded regional early warning systems.<br>  Economic Cooperation<br>  In 1951 the US provided the first aid to Israel, $65 million to help Israel take in Holocaust survivors and endangered Jews from Arab lands. Within 3 years, Israel's 650,000 Jews absorbed 600,000 refugees from Europe and the Arab nations.<br>  There has been economic aid to Israel every year since 1949, with the amounts fluctuating, generally increasing as the cooperation with Israel became closer or in years when Israel was forced to fight defensive wars or terrorism. From 1960 until 1985, there were no grants; aid consisted largely of loans, which Israel repaid, and surplus commodities, which Israel bought. The reference "U.S. Assistance to Israel" gives a table of annual amounts. The aid to other countries in the region has also increased and is similar in total amount. Much of the aid to Israel is for defense and the money is actually spent with U.S. suppliers so it recycles back to the United States.<br>  Israel is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. Several binational programs allow American companies and universities to benefit from Israel’s expertise in agriculture and high technology, while others aim to break down barriers to trade and cooperation between the two countries to make collaboration easier. Israel was the first country to sign a free trade agreement with the US, which has resulted in a quintupling of trade between the two countries. The US-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has served as a model for other trade agreements including the October 2000 FTA between the US and Jordan.<br>  For many years Israel received US financial and military assistance in a combined total of about $3 billion, divided into $1.2 billion in economic assistance and $1.8 billion in military aid. As the Israeli economy grew, and Soviet-era refugees were absorbed, the need for the aid package decreased. In recent years the economic aid has been reduced, while the military package has grown a little since the start of the al-Aqsa intifada.|`|WETYSQcfaa	Well Israel is a very determined and rich nation. It's army is marvelous. I believe that in a way Israel is trying to defend itself. But in this process a lot of unnecessary damage has been done. I think it should know its limits.

First it gives Israel $3 billion a year with no strings.

The film tells the story of the violence and blood shed that can be expected when civilized society is deprived of necessities such as food, water, or energy supplies.  It is an orgy of violence and bloodshed that present day  Californians should be thinking very seriously about.<br>  <br>   A January 17, 2009 story in the Los Angeles Times  by Evan Halper and Patrick McGreevy is headlined “California controller to suspend tax refunds, welfare checks, student grants.  It tells the story of  California’s ongoing financial crisis, brought on by years of liberal and Democratic dominance in California politics.<br>  But more importantly, it provides a chilling glimpse of what is in store for the people of America if  Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi are permitted to impose their ideal of what America is all about from their respective perches in Washington.<br>  <br>   According to the Times, State Controller John Chiang said he had “no choice but to stop making some $3.7 billion in payments in the absence of action by the governor and lawmakers to close the state’s nearly $42 billion budget deficit.  More than half of those payments are tax refunds.”  The state expects to be $346 million short of funds in the month of February, and by March the state could find itself totally insolvent.<br>  <br>   The controller anticipates that the suspended payments could be “rolled into IOU’s if California still lacks the  cash to pay its bills by March or April.  In a most unfortunate  choice of words, the controller said that it pained him to  “pull this trigger “ but that it was a “critically necessary action.  California officials have already designed an “IOU template” and are now negotiating with banks to determine whether taxpayers, students, and welfare recipients would be allowed to cash or deposit them, if and when they’re issued.<br>  <br>   Just ask yourself…Who  but a  bunch of liberal Democrats would even dream that  banks would exchange  cash for a worthless piece of paper that is  backed  by…nothing?  If you think that’s a good idea, you might also think it would be a good idea to elect a young inexperienced , radical leftist of questionable  citizenship as President of the United States.<br>  <br>   The times tells us that, “the payments to be frozen include nearly $2 billion in tax refunds; 300 million in cash grants for needy families, blind, disabled; and $13 million in grants for college students.”  The state will continue to pay more than $6.6 billion in school and healthcare bills.<br>   In the face if this looming disaster, the governor is asking for tax increases, spending cuts, the relaxation of some environmental regulations and legislation to allow some government  construction.  The governor has ordered non-essential state employees to take two days off each month…without pay …and most state offices, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, is to close on those two days.<br>  <br>   If you’ve never lived in California and have never visited a DMV office to acquire a drivers license or car tags, you have no idea what that means.<br>  According to the Times, the state has also stopped payment of bond money covering more than 5,300 public works projects in progress.  276 of those projects have been exempted because they are nearly complete and the cost of shutting them down would be greater than the cost to finish them.  In the meantime, contractors are warning of the unintended consequences of stemming the flow of public works funds, suggesting that such action would be taken at significant cost.  <br>  <br>   Caltran s Director Will Kempton estimates that the state would incur an estimated $350 million in legal costs, breach-of -contract claims, and expenses for securing dormant construction sites.<br>  To say that California is a state teetering on the brink of anarchy would be an understatement.<br>   What happens when welfare checks and student aid funds are cut off and public works projects are suspended.  Democrats in Sacramento will almost certainly find a way to ram tax increases through the legislature and the governor, threatened with another kind of “ cutoff” by his liberal Democrat wife, will sign them into law.<br>  <br>   But tax increases are exactly the wrong prescription.  As corporate taxes increase, businessmen across the state will react.  Some will lay off workers, increasing the ranks of the  unemployed, while others will simply close their doors and announce a move to Arizona, Texas or Oklahoma.  College students from San Diego to Sacramento will stage violent protests, shutting down most colleges and universities and over taxing police and National Guard forces.<br>  <br>   Taxpayers due refunds and public works contractors demanding payment for work already accomplished will clog the courts with lawsuits.  California will become the first state in the nation to experience a shortage of lawye|`|SahUDTLnaa	Yes you can darling. and the Truth has set you free , you go guy.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	No.<br>  <br>  Anything else?|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Bush lied?

It's a tradition that surely can be modified however.  And, I'm sure this would apply to other countries as well.  Take a look at England's royalty.  Bet they could cut back a tad also.

bl8co4hUaa	Nothing. I have a steady job, own my home, and have little debt.<br>  <br>  I also believe that the news media is blowing things out of proportion. Yes, there are some economic woes worldwide and nationally. Yes, unemployment has risen. But it is not AS BAD AS THEY SAY IT IS. We seem to be a nation built and raised on fear and panic. We accept that things are horrible, get scared and anxious, and withdraw, which by the way does create and compound the economic problem. Jobs laying off people? They're panicking, those companies, believing all the horrific news, and thus they lay off workers and compound the problem. It all comes full circle.<br>  <br>  There are some bad situations, worse in some places than others, and there is a lot of work and clean-up ahead. We are Americans. We will persevere and survive. But it is not so terrible that we are in dire straits, every single person.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, I'm not going overboard on spending, but I am absolutely shopping for gifts, necessities, and luxuries, thus doing my small bit for our local economy, as well as online shopping, too.

American is the home of capitalism and where, as we say, 'money talks', and the almighty dollar rules.

You just have to know where/how to look.  This probably isn't the right section to be asking these questions in however.  If you want to see what proof other people are using, then research into "Christian Apologitics".  I highly recommend Josh McDowell.  He spent years researching the "proof" and trying to disprove the Bible to a bunch of college Christians.  All of his research has been chronicled in a book called "New Evidence that Demands a Verdict" by Josh McDowell (about 500pages).  It's a really long book, but it's categorized.  He ended up proving to himself that there is sufficient evidence.  It's an interesting story and it will at least answer your questions for you.  If you want the short version of the book there's a short book that tells his story called "More than a Carpenter" by Josh McDowell.|`|s8nPN7pVaa	Simply ...........

jsW45ETkaa	I am sitting in USA, but answering from Australia where I intend to<br>   ask them a question. According to the question I clicked right under my profile, it comes from my newest lady contact, junkmail. BUT, on<br>  clicking to answer an apparent blank MALE avatar with a diff. display<br>  name appeared.  However, the question is the same and chance is<br>  virtually nill that 2 would ask the identical question, but I hope this gets to you.<br>  I in fact have the same question and no time to check for sure.  All I<br>  am absolutely sure of is that I have quite a few golds for the short time I have used Y/A. THE STAR DOES NOT MEAN BEST ANSWER.<br>  If you get a B.A. it shows up by your avatar and total points as a percentage, plus the total # of B.A.s is under the left bar graph on your profile page. The actual words "best answer" are printed when you<br>  select the green ANSWERS tab under your profile and find the question you answered to earn B.A. You will see the asker's dis.name,<br>  best answer in tiny almost un-readable gold letters and "junkmail"<br>  NOW, WHEN AN ASKER OR A VOTE CHOOSES A BEST ANSWER<br>  THERE ALSO APPEARS THE ADDITIONAL CHOICE of checking<br>   1/2/3/4 or 5 ((( STARS !!!!)))) indicating just how much best the best was. For example, I entered a quest. only to realize how to find the answer myself so I wasted 5 points. I got only one answer and though not exactly what I asked for she was the only person, including the original person who gave me the lost info, to make an effort. BUT I only<br>  checked 2 stars so I think her profile shows best answer under my<br>  question and a BLUE STAR with a 2 next to it.  FINALLY MY ANSWER / GUESS #1. IF I HAD CHECKED 5 STARS WITH HER B.A., THERE WOULD NOT BE A BLUE STAR & 5, BUT RATHER A<br>  GOLD STAR WITH NO # (ie. 5 is assumed).<br>  ANSWER/GUESS #2 isn't so wordy. Under your posted question is<br>  a blank white star outline...with..."Interesting?" and I think you earn <br>  points for being first to click the question as interesting. ONCE CLICKED THAT STAR TURNS GOLD, but this gold star is under your<br>  own question, NOT one you answered for someone else. I also noticed a 2 beside an "interesting question" gold star, so the computer tracks how many found it interesting.  I think my account<br>  settings allow only my contacts YOU to see my Q&As. Click on my<br>  BURLY avatar to jump to my profile. Scroll down to the green tabs<br>   ANSWERS / QUESTIONS / STARED QUESTIONS / WATCHLIST.<br>  Maybe you can by looking where my gold stars are ANSWER FOR<br>  YOURSELF ((((AND)))) FOR ME, TOO !!!!  <br>  NOTE; IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO LOOK FOR YOU AS GOING<br>  TO MY PROFILE (unless minimizing would hold this answer box) without loosing this box amongst 1000 others.<br>  NOW AS FOR THE THUMBS. I was eager to reach Level 2 so I could<br>  VOTE thumbs up or down. Repeating, I can't look now but check-out whether the thumbs are under questions, answers or both.  I AM SURE THEY ARE ONLY UNDER ANSWERS.  I don't know if the <br>  "answers community" is a select group or if all member / users are<br>  part of the community.  But, IF THE ASKER DOES NOT CHOOSE<br>  A BEST ANSWER, THEN IT GOES TO A "COMMUNITY VOTE"......<br>  AGAIN THE WORD "VOTE".  So, though those thumbs do indeed<br>  appear to do nothing, maybe it is your access or ballot (if LEVEL 2 or higher) TO MAKE VOTES +/- AND HELP CHOOSE A BEST ANSWER.|`|wdyf1sueaa	Stars, really good question<br>  Thumbs, Down=stu.id answer, Up=good answer<br>  <br>  Psychological bla bla thing.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	They illuminate the night sky.|`|RKUrIHI5aa	Stars are given by your mates or by people who enjoy your question and think it worthy of a star.

DphUE9tbaa	Channel 4 , the tabloids and the trashy supermarket mags can pay for it - they've foisted all this on us.  They may as well stick a camera in her coffin so her decay can be televised.  I blame the media more than I blame Jade herself.  She is a stupid and ignorant woman who hit on a way of making cash through having no dignity and she is pursuing it to the bitter end.  She might as well.  The rest of us should feel grubby that we have watched a private tragedy being displayed as a form of entertainment.|`|1d9d18f50c6ae9c10d7d5de30675bb13aa	Im not a fan of Jade but i cant imagine what she's going through , I feel so sorry for her boys having to grow up without their mother .

I would have done the same thing in her position. But I do think the media have monopolised on the situation too, of course they will do.

With that kind of money her kids will see no need to work and will probably end up in jail like her vile, money-grabbing husband anyway! Don't get me wrong, I feel sorry for the girl, it shouldn't happen to anyone!

(this may have changed, if yr library collects royalties to be sent to the copyright holders, in which case you read it or pay about as much as for the online article)

My Daughter went there      and after twelve months when her contract was over she found another post, but was treated like a skivvy and her boy friend at the time found her scrubbing the kitchen on her day off. He made her get up pack her case and told the Lady of the house that she was overstepping the mark. Anyway he took her to his Home and after a couple of weeks she came back home.He came over to see us after a month and asked us if he could marry her. Well they got married and he took her back with him. They both came home after a month and after a quick run around they got married in her own Church and then went back to live there. That was over 40yrs ago and she has a great life.

That ultimately could have led to sanctions.<br>  <br>  Due to a lack of time, the panel ultimately referred the matter to the inspectors general at the Pentagon and Transportation Department. Both are preparing reports, spokesmen said this week.<br>  <br>  "Fog of war could explain why some people were confused on the day of 9/11, but it could not explain why all of the after-action reports, accident investigations and public testimony by FAA and NORAD officials advanced an account of 9/11 that was untrue," the book states.<br>  <br>  The questioning of Giuliani was considered by Kean and Hamilton "a low point" in the commission's examination of witnesses during public hearings. "We did not ask tough questions, nor did we get all of the information we needed to put on the public record," they wrote.<br>  <br>  Commission members backed off, Kean and Hamilton said, after drawing criticism in newspaper editorials for sharp questioning of New York fire and police officials at earlier hearings. The editorials said the commission was insensitive to the officials' bravery on the day of the attacks.<br>  <br>  "It proved difficult, if not impossible, to raise hard questions about 9/11 in New York without it being perceived as criticism of the individual police and firefighters or of Mayor Giuliani," Kean and Hamilton said.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  In their book, which goes on sale Aug. 15, Kean and Hamilton recap obstacles they say the panel faced in putting out a credible report in a presidential election year, including fights for access to government documents and an effort to reach unanimity.<br>  <br>  ..."|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Those who spout a conspiracy theory have low self esteem.

I think he tries to call it as he sees it.  I do agree with you that a good American will back up his President, but only as long as he is following the United States Constitution.  Glenn Beck believes in the Second Amendment for all the right reasons (that is one of the reasons I like him) and President Obama wants to mess with the Second Amendment.  That, in itself, was enough to tip Glenn Beck over and as it should all Americans.  I think Glenn Beck presents some strong points on many issues including that one.  I will not follow a President who tries to take my constitutional rights away and Glenn Beck won't either.  An honorable Patriot does not allow a President to take away our constitutional rights and Glenn Beck uses his radio show to make people aware of what he sees is happening.  Granted, radio talk show is also an entertainment product so he would add his own gimmicky (sp) things like those you mentioned above.  Being a jerk sometimes gets people higher ratings.|`|U0QsRoiSaa	I think you're forgetting why we are Americans.  Way back 200 years ago we fought for freeom- of everything.  That includes freedom of speech and freedom to disagree.  And a good American will back up presidents who back up the people who pay taxes, not tax them double to pay for abortion clinics in third world countries.  Good Americans realize we employ the government, and we surround them.  Honorable patriots don't let themselves be brainwashed by idiots in the cabinet who don't pay taxes (tim geitner, the head of the IRS? kinda scary don't you think?)  I'm only 19 but I'm not going to agree with the government just because they are the government, I have the right to disagree and rich "pigs" as you call Beck are usually hardworking people who have a right to their money.  Others who steal it and tax the rich to give to the poor deserve to be put in jail.  So in conclusion, I respect the fact that we disagree, because I live in America and that's our right.|`|OsnCPSsoaa	I like Glenn Beck.  I do not always agree with him and sometimes I do disagree with him but he seems to be the fairest of all the people who do what he does.  I can understand and see why you do not like him.
CL5kLE2paa	YES, Israel did use disproportionate force|`|FO1XCZc4aa	Obviously...as well as indiscriminate|`|RKUrIHI5aa	Simple question, simple answer: Yes.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	No. They needed to damage Hamas fighting capabilities. Now the UN is admitting that some of the accusations against Israel were wrong. Originally news agencies were reporting that Schools in Gaza were being attacked, and that citizens hiding in these schools were killed. Now the UN says this is not true. How do we know that the reports of 500 children being killed is true? I mean, if they will lie about schools being attacked, won't they lie about how many civilians were killed?|`|GOifC7i3aa	if hamas was interested in the lives of gazans it would not provoke wars with israel<br>  <br>  and no israel used enough force to show it was sick of the rockets being fired at it's towns<br>  <br>  you might think that israeli lives are worth more than palestinian but your arithmetic is way out<br>  <br>  if hamas was able to kill more israelis it would ....would that make you feel better?|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	No,the response of Israel to the continuous rocket attacks from Gaza was very proportionate.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	simple answer yes|`|ECbyFWLCaa	The Arab countries has to accept Israel exists, and treat the Palestinians like other arabs. As it is now, they are held in poverty so everybody is to see how mean Israel is. But if you understand it's the Arab nations not accepting their loss - or "loss", Israel belonged to the jews before the arabs took it, so the arabs have just lost land they had stolen, like Spain was taken back from them- this will not work on you. Imaging all the arabs expelled from Spain living in eternal and miserable camps in the northern Morocco while everybody tried to make it look like the Spaniards was incredible evil to have retaken their land- it would have been the same thing. The only reason this is happening, is the Arab nations think they can convince the world into thinking Israel should be destroyed. The solution is to make the arabs accepting their loss, and accepting the palestinians into Saudi-Arabia, Jordan and Egypt as citizens. As it is now, there are laws against giving the palestinians citizenship in those countries, because it would harm their claim of getting "back" Palestine! So the arabs hates Israel more than they love their own people. No other tribe has ever treated their own people this bad.<br>  <br>  The arab deaths are a result of the Arab nations using the Palestinians as expendable pawns in a chess game. So your question is based on an incorrect view of the entire situation.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	1300 Palestinians dead (500 children)<br>  <br>  Israel did not use disproportionate force in the war against Hamas during its recent combat operation in Gaza.<br>  <br>  Consider the Urban combat zone. Consider the tragic outcome normal to civilians caught in such a situation. If you need an example see Dresden. <br>  <br>  Consider how many of the dead were armed militants (including the children). Consider how there are many reports of Hamas using sites near concentrations of civilians for the purpose of fighting. <br>  <br>  Consider how Hamas was not permitted to enter into ceasefire agreements by its masters in Damascus; its plain that Iran was hoping Israel would be forced into committing an atrocity.<br>  <br>  My intuition tells me that Israel used extreme care and restraint to minimize civilian casualties.<br>  <br>  1300 Palestinians versus 13 Israelis. I would call that natural selection. Stupidity has always been a capitol crime.|`|ZJ3D377qaa	I think the figures speak for themselves. They knew they could get away with it as usual so they deliberately killed hundreds of innocent people. And for some reason they do seem to think palestinian lives arent as valuable as theirs. Lets hope that they realise what hypocrites they're being. They cry over the jewish holocaust yet think nothing of trying to do the same thing themselves.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are begging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>       Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2   Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace will be so far.  ><br>  >>> But The Palestinians should be allowed to get armed, to be able defending themselves against racist terrorist criminal organization called "Israel" which is duly supported by :<br>  > The US and Most of European countries.<br>  >> Double standards of the UN organizations-such as Security Council.<br>  >>> The black VETO right of the US.<br>  >>>> The racist Zionism lobby in The US and Most of European countries.<br>  <br>  Map of Palestine<br>  <br>  www.countryseek.com|`|2d4d4d8f449f8266d3033948651354acaa	disproportionate force - yes.

Was that disproportionate? - Yes, Justified under the circumstances? - Yes.|`|Kggz7Eyiaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Also, Israel broke the ceasefire. Not Hamas. They did this on 6th November by murdering 6 Palestinians.|`|9GbPZUTXaa	Not forgetting they flattened the place like Dresden I'd say they did, and they timed it for the last days of Bush so they knew they'd get away with it.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Is the Pope a Catholic?|`|oLz4jYXqaa	It is always the case that when you send out a force to tackle someone who is trying to kill you, you have to send out a superior force if you can afford it. So if a gunman is shooting at people from a building, you have to send in as many police as you can muster. To send in one against one may happen in the movies, but it's just plain dumb and irresponsible. To expect Israel to use 'proportionate force' would be to tell it to send in a few dozen soldiers armed with home-made rockets and AK47 to match Hamas. Unfortunately many civilians were killed in the action, and that's something Israel will live to regret because it will haunt them. Some of the soldiers were clearly out of control and there was evidence that indiscipline and carelessness had crept into the forces. Let's hope the powers that be will learn lessons and not let it happen again.|`|QoFpoeuWaa	No.On the contrary,Israel used LESS force than she had to use.It′s a pity.And your statistics are a lie.Of 1200 arabs killed,730 were Hamas militants.Others are considered "civilians" only because they did not wear the Hamas uniform and had no weapons when the were killed.It does not make them civilians.<br>  Children were killed because Hamas used them(as well as women) as human shield.It′s recognized by the UN,ny the Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.|`|JH8lpdKiaa	disproportionate is not about who is stronger. it's about what is the appropriate response for shelling israeli towns. from every aspect of international law, this is a cause of war. and israel is stronger than hamas hence the number of casualties.<br>  <br>  rules of war is not about making things even or else wars will go on forever. 8 years of shelling only shows how patient israel has been before starting this war. <br>  <br>  if the UN really wants to do its job, then they should have intervened BEFORE a war starts to prevent it from happening, not when things already exploded.|`|WE6ziBrdaa	No they did not<br>  <br>  fact is hamas fired over 6000 missiles into Israel, each of these missiles where designed to kill<br>  <br>  hamas by firing missiles from schools hospitals built up areas committed war crimes as laid down in the fourth protocol of the Geneva convention and must take full responsibility for all civilian deaths, and that is the law btw<br>  <br>  <br>  please notice not a single attack was made by the IDF into the west bank, therefore that is proof their action s where not disproportionate but where acts of self defence|`|xKtNnlMZaa	I don't believe they did, They were under attack from rockets fired randomly into their country. <br>  The terrorists that control Gaza used the likes of hospitals and schools to do this from knowing that when Israel returned fire it would result in a large and tragic loss of life.|`|URl4r7N1aa	Absolutely!!!!<br>  And once more for the poorly educated Israeli apologists who have so much trouble understanding the truth, It is not Israel, it is illegally occupied Palestine!!!!!<br>  GET OFF MY LAND!!!|`|9Vrrj0otaa	simple <br>  Israel: Democratic country<br>  Hamas: terrorist|`|fUuYe7onaa	Of course not!Number of losses used as a criteira of who was right in the confict,what a stupidity!|`|BOeCGLACaa	You already know the answer.........yes they did.....
e802de1531bba8087cb150cd1a050d61aa	Cold hearted people that do not deserve the title of being called parents!!|`|Uaoep16Qaa	im not saying its right, but its easy to sit in your nice comfortable houses with luxuries most of the world doesnt have, the internet too, and judge. <br>  -maybe these ppl were dirt poor, told by some missionaries not to use birth control, or how abortion is so horrible, and ends up having a bunch of kids they cant support. so sure maybe it is for monetary gain for them,...but that means that the ppl who gave them the money, obviously have money, so the kid would maybe have a better life anyways|`|bxxwhP04aa	Horrible isn't it ?   Just about the same as abortion, the way I see it.|`|5nPUDEcvaa	Few people sell theirs to good parents for better future of thier babies as they may nor be able to do so. But majorities do it for money and their comfort. Once this business has started, only few genuine cases excercised this way. Majority is exploiting the web system for their hunger for money or revenge. How can this be stopped. People need strong educationn and basic needs of their life.|`|zAhlNl6oaa	Well, it depends who sells their child & why?....A couple may have 5 or 6 children in some poor Asiatic country, now if they are in utter poverty, and hungry every day, and no work available for parents, then they must decide if it`s better to sell one child(daughter) and preserve lives of other 5 children, or watch all 6 children starve slowly?...Now mind you in many countries there is no public welfare system as in U.S. and there is no help to poorest of the poor-they are on their own. And I am sure each of those parents who in such situation are forced to sell one of their children are struggling very desperately with their decision.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	My God.  Every day now, it seems, there is yet another story in the news that makes your hair curl. Why do these selfish people have children if they don't really want them? So many people out there are desperate for a child and can't have one and then you get the likes of this carry on. I despair at this world sometimes, I really do.|`|80fWQyDnaa	They are not selling their babies for holidaying or for buying expensive valentine gifts ! This is acute poverty as well as their selfless love to their baby. Atleast the baby will be survived. And they themselves will be alive for some more days.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Selfishness, cold-hearted, whacked out on drugs or alcohol, greed, sick in the head. I am so thankful I don't know people who would do such a thing. Can you imagine, finding out that your parents tried or did sell you? What a sick world.|`|O0ojUIfvaa	it depends on the people who sell the babies and why they do it. mostly they do so due to poverty and their inability to bring up the child.|`|PfXHhp3Haa	You live in India? Whoa that's crazy...you guys are a day ahead...it's barely Wednesday 4rth<br>  and you...<br>  Thu, Mar 5 03:41 AM<br>  <br>  weird...|`|L6JUVtGZaa	people who sell their babies aren't parents, they are just vessels used to carry a child. A parent would never do that. Probably a lot of them are addicts who need the cash. Sick...|`|P9IvPEfkaa	Love will be there but with that they cannot live ok but the childs should not think there bad luck|`|c78f02a587cab0827d22e1e69eb0e066aa	these ppl have body, not souls.
AA10199189	1,  lead - just the most salient point(s) (with/out a catchy phrase)<br>  2.  para's with most important details (with/out quotes)<br>  3.  more info but organized in such a way that it only fleshes out the article more, in case it needs to be cut from the bottom (never from the top. when you are pasting the page together you may find you had 13 column inches of copy and only 7 of space, so the article must read correctly even after it has been cut.)
1FxFistFaa	have you thought about seeking mental help - that was just toooooooo boring to read - i just read your last sentence
AA10199189	it's a typo|`|XpnnNLkOaa	Yep.  Someone's trying to look smarter than they are.  "Describing" or "detailing" would work much better.|`|4rFCesSsaa	It also can mean to publish

My God, is this woman for real?! She is completely crackers!|`|vnCqJHS7aa	I believe that in addition to the link, to the actual recording that Jezabel Princess posted - McCons are now placing it in all of their toilets/rest-rooms speaker systems, as cold-comfort music.<br>  <br>  Duh! She should have stayed on - if she had received them, the call was already through.|`|d3E1Dedoaa	If you want to listen and somewhat see, here's the site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-au&brand=ninemsn&vid=c530cb5d-5b40-4248-8fa0-ebf76d12fcc0&from=&fg=rss" rel="nofollow">http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-a...</a>|`|p65mPSozaa	I read about it and heard she got arrested.

Y46YE1e2aa	I think it is what, or who will grab the most attention for the media e g. viewing/ or  newspapers|`|YJrrZo9jaa	In terms of entertainers, its when their publicist or agent wants them to be interviewed, say to promote a movie or book..  In "regular" life I think looks have somewhat to do with it, depends on the subject matter, some people may seem more approachable than others, and I think they would be more likely to be chosen.  Try it out next time you're people watching, you can almost spot from a distance who would likely stop and talk to you if you were to approach them.
FhrCLLzFaa	They all suck.|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	I feel bad for all those that have lost jobs and lost their homes.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Another poster just asked why everyone is complaining about being poor!! He obviously lives at home with mommy and daddy. It ticks me off, how some folks are oblivious to what`s going on around them.|`|4cc90baba09d87b1eabfc0d310d19e15aa	I am starting to get quite worried about the state of our<br>  <br>  financial affairs here in our country.  Too much spending and<br>  <br>  just hope we don't end up even worse than the days of the<br>  <br>  great depression.  Most of us have not lived through a depression,<br>  <br>  although if you lose your job and home, you are in the midst of one.|`|iy9xz6oNaa	This bothers me<br>  <a href="http://www.politicalarticles.net/blog/tag/sean-hannity-commits-treason/" rel="nofollow">http://www.politicalarticles.net/blog/ta...</a>|`|EVFbElUYaa	What is the point in being bothered.  i cant do anything about any of it|`|hFfcf6Szaa	The economy, government, lack of respect for the environment, pollution, and general disregard for human life that we are seeing everyday makes me very sad and worried.  I feel helpless.  I think the only thing we can do is change.
75f32164f497824aa7a40d166ac823faaa	I agree with you its a lot of BUFU.|`|AA12066574	I don't know what BUFU stands for, but the protests I've seen are mostly against the ridiculous so-called stimulus bill that was pushed by Pres. Obama. There are large numbers of people who know that putting the govt. further in debt solves nothing.|`|98a17cb4f1cc266cc52d47121beff3c1aa	British Taxing the Tea imported

I also like to see him stop blaming G.W.BUSH for the problems. He knew what he was getting into in the first place...so its either put up or shut up and if you can't handle the heat then get out of the kitchen.|`|AA11403313	The actions of Him and the congress only confirmed my belief both of them were incapable of handling reality. The throwing away of our economic future by careless spending while pushing for more taxes and restrictions on the average taxpayer  was expected but not this fast.|`|f5gT8Apiaa	Not at all, didn't trust him then and still don't trust him now.|`|Uj6sVcJKaa	Nope. Still dont like him.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	No. Still don't like him
OA3Mgsuaaa	The cartoon showed 2 cops with guns drawn and a shot chimp llaying on the ground with bullet holes. It was a reference to the Chimp mauling in Ct the week before.<br>  the caption read " I guess they are gonna have to find somepne else to write the next stimulus bill".<br>  Critics felt that was a sublime reference that Obama was a "chimp", a racial slur. The Post and the cartoonist claim they were merely stating that the bill, not written by Obama, but by Nancy Pelosi, was written by someone with the mental capacity of a monkey.<br>  Either way, the Post apologized if they offended anyone, and assured their readers it was not their intent to mock the President.
