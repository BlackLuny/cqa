xyIZv6iiaa	How would we know?<br>  <br>  edit:  lol sorry rk|`|jdRKZe18aa	First of all "perfection" is an eternal pursuit not one reached by anyone just because they've DIED or anything and no one but God & Christ have reached perfection or godly status.<br>  <br>  And insofar as Joseph Smith - unless you have some HOT LINE to heaven that we don't - I don't believe ANYONE knows exactly what his current status is except Heavenly Father.  BUT it's safe to say he's also in paradise with all who have died and is awaiting the resurrection too, as are all who have died too.....|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	That is not for us to know.  <br>  What we do know is that in the D&C, the Lord promises Joseph that his calling and election is made sure.  That means that he was accepted into exaltation in the Celestial Kingdom.  The logical extension of that calling and election is that he will be blessed to be like Christ and the Father, to become one with them, to be an heir in the Father's Kingdom.  <br>  In other words, yes, he will become an exalted being, attaining godhood.  However, the timing of that event is in the Lord's hands and we have no idea when that will take place.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	I can't remember where I heard this, but I think Joseph Smith may have said that Abraham has progressed to the point where he is now creating his worlds, and also Noah. I have heard that, but I don't know if it's accurate. It's definitely not taught in Sunday Schools.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Probably not.  Eternal progression is an ongoing process and, like the name says, it's ETERNAL.  He hasn't had eternity yet so I doubt it.  I'm sure he has learned quite a bit though.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	How should we know?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  lol.  Great minds phrog...great minds.  ;-)|`|9qSD385Paa	Joseph Smith restored God's church (from a Mormon point of view, no negative anything meant towards other religions) and sacraficed his own life to ensure it's survival. He will absolutely become like God. From what i understand, he does have to wait for Christ to come again before his body and his spirit are reunited and made perfect, but i have no doubt that Joseph Smith will be ushered into the courts on high and become as God.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	Mormon doctrine does not teach that they will become "like" God. Mormon doctrine teaches that will become actual gods able to create and rule over their own worlds.  <br>  <br>  "THE STRAITNESS OF THE WAY. Mortality is the testing or proving ground for exaltation to find out who among the children of God are worthy to become Gods themselves, and the Lord has informed us that "few there be that find it." Church Prophet Joseph Fielding Smith Jr., Doctrines of Salvation, Vol.1, p.69 - p.70<br>  <br>  "ALL EXALTED MEN BECOME GODS. To believe that Adam is a god should not be strange to any person who accepts the Bible. When Jesus was accused of blasphemy because he claimed to be the Son of God, he answered the Jews: "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?"<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith taught a plurality of gods, and that man by obeying the commandments of God and keeping the whole law will eventually reach the power and exaltation by which he also will become a god." Joseph Fielding Smith Jr., Doctrines of Salvation, Vol.1, p.97 - p.98<br>  <br>  But to answer you question, no, Joseph Smith has not become a god.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Joseph Smith is just a man he is not like god He is just another false prophet

(philosophy of finding your self in nature etc... can be summed up by the american writers hawthorne, Thoreau, Melville, poe, dickinson, etc.) i dont think that it has effect the mormon religion in any significant way. this can be supposed because their general basis concerning nature or individuality is taken from their founder joseph smith which, to no offense, was a theocracy marginalized by the early christian politicians and leaders thus having to move into the "wilderness" by necessity not by choice..|`|xyIZv6iiaa	you mean like any system of philosophy emphasizing intuition and spirituality above the empirical and material....kind of what it's all about isn't it?  now whether the affect came from there, or whether it is just inherent within spiritual endeavors.....?

UWlRLXvRaa	It means to surrender our own plans for Christian-selves. We are those who have seen our need for Him. We have seen that we are fallen and broken and cannot fix ourselves.  We cannot put ourselves back together again. That's why we came to Christ. We finally gave up trying to save ourselves. We are like the person in the water who can't swim and Jesus jumped in to save us. We fought Him in our panic and He waited until we finally gave up the fight and let Him rescue us.<br>  <br>  This verse is a reminder that we didn't start our faith. Christ did. And we cannot finish our faith, apart from Him. Why? Because we can't! Salvation isn't the idea that some have - God wiped clean the chaukboard of their lives and now they're gonna prove to Him that they were worth saving. They think they can prove to Him that they weren't really that bad and yes, they can do it- they can save themselves. They just needed another try. Paul addressed this issue with the Galation believers. (Gal. 3:1-3, especially verse 3)<br>  <br>   NO! Apart from Him we can do nothing. Nothing! And that includes finishing this Christian race! Yes, we'll finish the race by His grace but we are not the author and completer of our faith. He is. He sustains us. He help us. He enables us. He causes us to believe and desire and do.<br>  <br>  There are times when we fail and fall down. We can beat ourselves up for it or make promises to try harder but neither produce good, lasting results because that is the way of the flesh. We are as depedent upon Jesus to finish the race as we were when we began it. And that is humbling.<br>  <br>  Some boast of their great faith. They have forgotten that the faith they have was a gift from God. Eph. 2:8 tells us "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—" <br>  <br>  The gift isn't just grace. It's "grace...through faith" The faith part is just as much a gift as is the grace part.<br>  <br>  See our dependency upon God is great! We must depend on Him for the grace to do and even the faith to believe in Him. Many of us evangelicals have forgotten this. Many of us have condemned atheists for not having faith. Many of us have condemned other believers for not having as much faith as we do or think we do. Which is to say that faith arises within ourselves. But that isn't true. Faith - Biblical faith is a gift from God.<br>  <br>  Like a seed, it is in the process of growth and immature at first. But God knows how to bring our faith to maturity and completeness. He works in us and through us and with us to finish what He started. The minute we start trying to finish our faith in and of ourselves, we are chosing to walk apart from Him. We fall from grace and are not walking by faith (in response to God) or in fellowship with Him. (Many backsliders can be found in church 3 times a week!)<br>   <br>  Jesus finishes it. We are who we are because He is who He is. And we will be who we will be because He is who He is. Yes, we have a part to play. Christians aren't passive in this process. But He is the One who began us and will finish us. <br>  <br>  That revelation leads to rest and confident action. It also brings glory to Him, not ourselves. <br>  <br>  So when we notice the parts of us that are undone and incomplete; when we struggle with sin; when we feel the pull back to trusting in ourselves;  when the flesh rises up and fights the Spirit; when the devil attacks us with his lies that tell us we'll never make it to completion, when our own hearts condemn us...we look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. We trust in Him because we are His job and He'll get the job done! Hallelujah!|`|nqfgt0BRaa	There is a race set before us to run,it is tough and stiff,the winds of resistance are so thick,but the rest of chapter eleven speaks of people like us who ran and reached the finnish line.in that regard as we start or somewhere in the middle of the race,when the run course begins to take its tall on us,and the feet give-in to the friction of the run-way,and the heart feels like succumbing to the exerted pressure of despair,then we lift our eyes , and focus the finishing line,(Jesus) and joy of celebration, there after.I watched the Olympics last year, and saw mr. Bolt do 100m, the way he starts, the intensity of concentration,mid way,the calculated steps,the breathing system,to absorb pressure and I said yes this is how I should run this race.|`|gLyD1CiIaa	The less of my own self ego in this cup, the more Christ fills me.<br>  <br>  Before a man is born again, the image in the mirror is the reflection of himsel. <br>  <br>  When a man is born again, that image becomes foggy, unclear. <br>  <br>  Yet, as the man grows in Christ by faith, the image begins to become clearer and clearer over time until the image is of Christ Jesus. <br>  <br>  So remember, that Jesus is the beginning and the finishing of our faith. He was there when we first believed, becoming born again. He was there carrying us when we were at our weakest. He will be there at the resurrection when we are called home. <br>  <br>  Praise God. Come Lord Jesus Come.|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Hi Jimmy, "Jesus is the author" because he was there in the beginning. He knew what He had to do and He did it. He is our Faith. He is what carries us through our daily living. He is what we hold on to and the hope we have in one day standing face to face with Him will be the end of our faith. Therefore, He also is the "finisher" of our faith. <br>  Imagine Jimmy, one day standing physically next to Him.<br>  Remember 1 Cor. 13:13. And Now abideth faith, hope, charity(love), these three; but the greatest of these is charity. We will need faith and hope no more when we are with Him. <br>  Praise God and God Bless. :)|`|px2TpM9qaa	i means you look into his eyes as he looks into your and truly say "i love you." and if he says "i love you too." then it's right.|`|EnSJnaHEaa	To depend on Jesus for everything. to follow Jesus faithfully.|`|xkSwcCW1aa	It means never give up on the  free gift which God has given us through His son Jesus Christ which is your salvation.|`|qnaGMFAGaa	I know I probably sound broken record. but, I am quite new to this revelation of grace. I remember a Pastor who had been introduced to this revelation of grace about 8 years ago, Shared  that, when he was First introduced to the Revelation of God's grace,  all He said was " The devil is defeated at the cross & he is not a problem" :) <br>  So,  forgive me  me if I sound a bit  repetitive.:) <br>  <br>  Any way, to answer your question, It means to look to  Jesus faith not our faith. as he is the author and finisher of "FAITH". not our faith. <br>  <br>  <br>    I heard some one said this...<br>  <br>  " .When you ask yourself, “Do I have enough faith?” you have already put faith as a hindrance between you and Jesus’ finished work. The more you focus on your faith, the more faith slips away. But if you focus on the finished work of Christ and see God’s grace towards you, God sees that as faith! Without realizing it, faith is there in your heart to believe that you will not die of what Christ has already borne away for you completely, and you will see your miracle manifest!"  Yes Jesus is the outer & finisher of our faith. Let us keep resting in His finished work of the Cross.:)<br>  <br>  God bless you Jimmy.:)|`|XiITTg3waa	HE IS THE ONLY DEITY TO PUT OUR FAITH IN CAUSE HE IS THE CREATOR OF THE TERM !!<br>  <br>   WITHOUT HIM ,,FAITH DOES NOT EXIST !!<br>  <br>   JUST LIKE EVERTHING ELSE ...|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	It means to believe the word of God -1corinthians 14:34-35 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.<br>  <br>  35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.<br>  <br>  instead of context and tradition.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Turn to Jesus and turn your life over to Him by way of repenting of your sins and becoming a Born Again Christian.

Hallelujah : )<br>  <br>  The Christian life involves hard work. It requires us to give up whatever endangers our relationship with God, to run patiently, and to struggle against sin with the power of the Holy Spirit. To live effectively, we must keep our eyes on Jesus. We stumble when we look away from him, at ourselves, or the circumstances surrounding us. We are running for Christ, not ouselves and we must always keep him in sight|`|r8rykCkGaa	It means basically to trust him humbly like he is your daddy, at least this is the feeling I get on this.

Let's be honest, the only way she could be famous is to be super controversial otherwise nobody would care to here what some dumb blonde has to say about subjects she knows nothing about.|`|kM4D8e4Aaa	She does not have any facts, and if you did you wouldn't agree with her. She gets off on making controversial statements and passes it off as "telling it like it is" when she isn't well-informed on any of the issues she attacks.<br>  <br>  Not one time has any of the three mentioned insulted their white mothers. NOT ONCE! And they are seen as black regardless of being biracial because people focus on appearances, and for all appearances they are black.|`|PvPPivLJaa	Bottom line: You can't deny the truth. The truth is our American society was constructed in a way that forcibly refused blacks entry into most mainstream sects, including film and government.  The truth is our American society chose for generations that those who aren't fully white, are black. The truth is, there was never an Oscar winner with a black parent (and as mentioned earlier...society created the one-drop rule) before Halle. There was never a President who had a black parent.  The denominator is black...or maybe white...but this has always been the case and you ask me why this is? You must know this is not my doing.  Blame whoever made up the asinine one-drop rule.<br>  <br>  So, yea, Ann Coulter, once again has shown her flawed logic.  Blaming biracials for a system created by her own people. Rewording the acknowledgment of these facts as "playing victim." Nice.|`|AA10866651	The same thing I think about any of the rest of the filth that spews out of Tranny Ann's crazy vicious pie-hole.

Her column is good for lining bird cages, and not much else.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	I think she is some what of a radical, she is complaining about things that she knows absolutely nothing about.She is saying that because someones black father abandoned them that they shouldnt embrace their black side. She is basically saying that if your father abandoned you early in life therefore you should not claim your black side based off of one person in the black community. She needs to do more research. If that the case then I should hate ALL white people for what was done to my fathers side of the family even though the present whites did nothing to him. I should hold a grudge against the entire white community. If I was too think anymore about her my IQ would become significantly lower.<br>  <br>  EDIT:: lets be serious for a moment, if Halle, Alicia Keys Barack Obama etc never mentioned that they had a white mother no one would have ever known they were mixed. So what does it matter. Her facts are 100% WRONG, her thoughts and opinions are ignorantly rooted and its sad that she has viewers that follow her uneducated thoughts|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	The one thing I don't agree with is that she said that a child will automatically become a social outcast or criminal if they were raised by a single mother. I'm 100% white and I was raised by a single mother who is mentally ill. I'm doing fine- at university hoping for the best and brightest future. <br>  <br>  I guess Ann just says what she wants to say and doesn't care who she offends. I'm not offended by what i read but I did notice that a lot of mixed celebs will say they are half black. they should also say they are half white for the sake of their own white mother's pride. But there is nothing wrong with sayng they are half black. <br>  <br>  I don't think most people would agree with you. You need to realise that just 100 years ago that if you were mixed or black it was hard to succeed because of social barriers. There are some black and mixed celebs and successful people who did get to the top based off of merits

tYqUutidaa	According to ancient Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman, created on Zeus’ orders as a punishment for mankind. Her “box” (actually a sort of jar) contained many evil things, such as toil, illness and despair, but it also contained Hope. When the jar was opened, these evils as well as Hope were released into the world.<br>  <br>  In the early days of the Olympian Gods, Zeus, Lord of the Gods, jealously guarded his secrets. He had ordered his cousins, the Titans Epimetheus and Prometheus, to bring gifts to all of the animals on Earth. When he got to Man, Epimetheus found he had nothing left. His brother Prometheus, who had the gift of foresight, stole fire from the Gods by tricking Zeus and smuggling fire away from him inside the hollow stalk of a fennel plant. Prometheus then gave fire to Man, and warned Epimetheus not to accept any “gift” from the Gods, as it would be a trick.<br>  <br>  Zeus was furious. He decided to punish both Prometheus and Man for the theft of fire. Prometheus was bound, and every day an eagle ripped out his liver and ate it. Titans are immortal, so the liver grew back every day. As for Man, Zeus’ punishment was more devious. He ordered the Gods to create Pandora, a comely woman who looked like the Goddesses of Olympus. Craftsman Hephaestus molded her from clay, Aphrodite taught her how to be feminine, Athena taught her crafts and weaving and Hermes was ordered by Zeus to teach her to be deceitful as well as curious.<br>  <br>  Pandora was given a pithos, a large jar or urn. Inside were other “gifts” from Zeus, such as toil, hardship and illness. Hermes took her to Epimetheus as a gift. Forgetting his brother’s advice, he accepted. Pandora, curious, opened the pithos, allowing all of the evils inside to escape, and they have plagued mankind ever since. The pithos also contained Hope, however, and this, too was released (although in some versions of the legend, such as Hesiod’s, Hope did not escape the pithos because such was Zeus’ will). Pandora herself felt badly about unleashing the evils and tried to close the pithos, but she couldn’t close it in time.<br>  <br>  The legend of Pandora and her “box” have caught the imagination of countless artists. Pottery and carvings from ancient Greece show the legend, as do classical paintings and sculptures. Poems have been written about the story and it has been made into a movie. Recently, “Pandora’s Box” even made an appearance in the movie Lara Croft Tomb Raider: the Cradle of Life, where it is depicted as an ancient relic.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <br>  Classical Gods and Heroes: Rhoda A.

Each bestowing a gift of some sort to her overall creation. She opened a jar, and released all the evils in the jar out into the world. When she stopped the jar up all that was left inside was hope. It is unknown if she released the evils on purpose or if it was an accident.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora</a>|`|IeLBIACaaa	In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman.

How can you like somebody you don't understand? That doesn't make any sense.  Anybody can have a sexy voice. Anybody can speak sweet nothings into your ear.  Why does it have to be a guy who doesn't speak anything you know. What a dreamy relationship, but an illogical one if that.  Go and find somebody who can speak the works you want to hear, not some guy you picked up at school, because he was available.  That's why he's available for you.  He doesn't want you, he wants what you have to offer.  Talk to any guy of his culture or his language, and they will ask you why you are with him, if you can't understand him, and you'll notice that all of his friends have a girl from their and your boyfriend's culture, and your boyfriend just wants something out of you.  If he wanted to just hang out and communicate with you, he'd do that with somebody of his own culture and wouldn't have left his country.  He obviously wants you for something, and you are falling for it blindly.  GET REAL! Tell him to get a life, and then, you two can talk.  Don't ever let your guard down to him, because the girls of his culture are just waiting for you to be a dumb American so that they can move their stuff in.  You are not a girl standing outside of a 7-11, who any guy can put his hands on.  Treat yourself as such, and tell him to get a life, before he even speaks two more words to you.  You are not stupid.  DON'T BE SO NAIVE. Don't be a playdoll for other cultures.  You are not their toy.  You are smart.  So, start acting like it.|`|uLiZcKmYaa	i am with someone ,and when we met i felt the exact same way u do now, i felt insecure about our relationship. but we have been together 5 yrs.- at times we still have moments where one of us doesn't understand the other...but there are also times that we finish each others sentences. i think what really matters is whether or not u really connect, have the right chemistry, and our sincere...if thats there the rest will fall in place...trust me u will get used to the accent :] i did..besides there are couples that speak the same native language and have problems communicating...as far as the womanizer worry, thats possible with any guy...i don't really think it's just a cultural thing' goodluck...i hope this helped in some way.

xkSwcCW1aa	Life is a journey. You have to walk with God and His son Jesus Christ to reach your destination|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	The perfection of existence is through life. Rather, the true existence of existence is through life. Life is the light of existence, and consciousness is the light of life. Life is the summit and foundation of everything. Life appropriates everything for living beings; it is as though it makes one thing the owner of everything. Through life, a living thing may say: “All these things belong to me. The world is my house. The universe is my property, given to me by my owner.”<br>  Just as light is the cause of things being seen, and, according to some, of the existence of colours, so is life the revealer of beings; it is the cause of their qualities being realized. Furthermore, it makes an insignificant particular general and universal, and is the cause of universal things being concentrated in a particular. It is also the cause of all the perfections of existence, by, for example, making innumerable things co-operate and unite, and making them the means of unity and being endowed with spirit. Life is even a sort of manifestation of Divine unity in the levels of multiplicity, and a mirror reflecting Divine oneness.|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	Matthew 10:39<br>  Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.|`|2vf6tu8Oaa	Life is challenges, temptations and desires while none of them would embrace ppl to have best thoughts, feelings and courage.

hceNM6Uxaa	Your confusion is in assuming that being Jewish is a matter of 'blood'.  It isn't and it never has been.  It is a matter of religion and tradition.  Quite why Koestler got himself into such a twist about all of this, I don't know, but he talked complete nonsense, which is a shame for such an intelligent man.  <br>  <br>  We do know that men with the surname Cohen, throughout the world, have genetic markers linking them to a distant ancestor.  But of course, this merely tells us about the passing on of tradition and the emphasis laid on marrying within the community . This isn't a racial matter.  If you are an inheritor of the Jewish tradition, it is of course up to you whether you choose to be a practising Jew.  I'm a convert. with a father who acknowledged his Jewish heritage (the family can be traced back to the 15th century) but was adamantly not Jewish by religion - but never converted to another one, as he was an agnostic/atheist.  I'm just as Jewish as he was.  <br>  <br>  Trying to find prophecies about the fate of the Jewish people is a remarkably Christian approach to the Tanakh.  It's certainly not central to Jewish tradition or faith.|`|x3EPqezJaa	No, there's no truth to Koestler's thesis. That is, the Jews today show all evidence, biologically, genetically, somatically of having been descended from the ancient Hebrews of Judea--WITH lots of intermarrying with the local populations. The Jewish Khazars were wiped out.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	Koestler's book was a highly controversial thesis. Koestler stated that his intent in writing "The Thirteenth Tribe" was to defuse antisemitism by undermining the identification of European Jews with Biblical Jews. <br>  <br>  Ironically, Koestler's thesis that Ashkenazi Jews are not Semitic has become an important claim of many antisemitic groups.<br>  <br>  It seems like you are confused about a few things, so I'll try to clarify. <br>  <br>  There is no such thing as being Jewish by blood. Judaism is a religion NOT a race. Jewish people come in ALL races, ethnic groups and backgrounds. We are all people united under the religion of Judaism.<br>  <br>  I am assuming that you are referring to Beta-Israel: They are not believed to be the 13th tribe but the tribe of Dan actually. <br>  <br>  Most of the Ethiopian Beta Israel community have emigrated to Israel under its Law of Return. In 1973 Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, then the Chief Sephardic Rabbi, based on the Radbaz and other accounts ruled that the Beta Israel were Jews and should be brought to Israel. He was later joined by a number of other authorities who made similar rulings including the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Shlomo Goren.<br>  <br>  The Israeli government mounted rescue operations during Operation Moses (1984) and Operation Solomon (1991) for their migration when civil war and famine threatened these populations within Ethiopia. <br>  <br>  In the 1970s and early 80s the Beta Israel were forced to undergo a modified conversion ceremony involving immersion in a ritual bath, a declaration accepting Rabbinic law.  With the consent of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Rabbi Amar ruled that it is forbidden to question the Jewishness of this community.<br>  <br>  Judaism is and has always been a very diverse religion: After the Diaspora people moved to very different regions. This is why there are Ashkenazic (European), Sephardic (Spain/Portugal ) and Mizrahi (Middle East/North Africa) Jews. <br>  <br>  Smaller groups include but are not restricted to: <br>  <br>  Indian Jews (Bene Israel, Bnei Menashe, Cochin Jews, Bene Ephraim) the Romaniotes (Greece), the Italian Jews (Bené Roma), the Teimanim (Yemen and Oman) and Chinese Jews (Kaifeng).<br>  <br>  NONE of this makes anyone MORE or LESS Jewish. What you can say however, is that ALL Jewish people are a family.<br>  <br>  Take my family for example: We were expelled from Spain in the 13th century then went ahead and moved to Syria until this century, when we fled to the US.<br>  <br>  Reading the Tanach is not cut & paste -- There are a lot of things that go extremely in depth. This is why we have Rabbis and the Talmud.|`|CEwivM9naa	I agree with Queen Ahuva, I find it amzing that the only ones who got thumbs down were her and the people who supported this womans discovery. The ones who held to the traditional views got all thumbs up. So much for "tolerance" and "Acceptance" I find it very very sad..... I study history and in my research I found out that the Germans were experimenting on black people for almost 50 years before they carried out the Holocaust in Germany. In fact, one of Hitlers 1st orders of business was to force black germans to be sterilized so they could not reproduce. The books I discovered this information in is called "Hitlers Black Victims"  By Clarence Lusane and Germany's Black Holocaust 1890-1945 by Fripo Carr for anyone who wants to read the books for themselves. Much of history like this I found has been very well hidden. It is like people only want to view history a certain way....I think that what this jewish woman discovered could be possible, but many refuse to accept any truth but what supports their long held beliefs and they never want to entertain the fact they could be wrong or what they have been taught to believe about themselves and others could be a lie.|`|OiK7brCoaa	First of all as a white Jew in heart(Romans 2:17-29) I will address you with scripture such as the real Israelites of blood and of heart. Secondly being a Jew by blood does matters their is power in the blood and that blood is spiritual and also physical--the Word came down in the flesh. <br>  <br>  This truth is a need to know since if you are of the Hebrew bloodline and you were commiting sinful acts against YHWH in ignorance, this would cause you a perpetual life of experiencing the curses of Deuteronomy 28. <br>  <br>  We know that the gentiles are blessed in thier fullness and control the banks, media and the beast(government) as well as the world--go look it up for yourself. That being the case does explain why the majority of the Tribe of Israel are still cursed to this day (Romans 11). Now if they are cursed then they would also be led captive around the world not by thier own free will. Blacks were the only nation scattered and led captive against their will via the slave trade (Luke 21:24--Isaiah 5:13--Deuteronomy 28:68). <br>  <br>  I can see why majority of gentiles would keep the blacks from knowing the truth although many blacks(Hebrews) die from thier own lack of knowledge. Many of these blacks will protect the lie they have been fed directly and indirectly for many generations. Many don't even know why they can't be successful as the gentiles, so they blame it on the so called "White Man" but its not a white man keeping them in bondage its "YHWH" keeping them back due to thier lack of knowledge. The only way for many to come up financially is to turn full-heartedly to a life of sin. <br>  <br>  Its funny to know that gentile church's send money to israel and believe they will be blessed when they send money to the wrong Iraelites. The only one who can save the true Iraelites is YHWH, but the majority of the jew-ish have already saved themselves.  <br>  <br>  If any knowledgable Black(Israelite) reads this please know that speaking the truth from the spirit and not the soul does payoff but only in love. So remember there are more cornelius's out there who have already joined this battle with you and some will join in the future. Remember that your focus should be on Israel first!<br>  <br>  As long as blacks remain in ignorance then the gentiles will continue to rule them, and be blessed before them. <br>  <br>  The curses are meant to only bring you(Blacks) to the truth of who you trully are(Israelites). Intolerance of your presnt creates your future.|`|s5AeSQrfaa	Regarding "Q"'s comments first of all do you have documented proof that the Khzars were wiped out, in other words, back up your statement. Before you dismiss Arthur Kostler's book as not being true, Do you live in Israel? Have you expereinced what he expereinced when he was alive or are you dismissing it becasue (gasp!) it just might be true?  In answer to your question dear jewish lady if you read the curses in Deuteronomy 28 and ask yourself, what group of people have been sent into slavery by ships?  (Deuteronomy 28:68) Had their children sold away?  (Deuteronomy 28:32,41) Have the lowest success rate (Deuteronomy 28:29) and the list goes on. IF you read the curses as they are in deuteronomy 28, you will see what race of people FIT the curses to the letter! Here is one thing to consider as well. Moshe  (Moses) passes as Pharoh's grandson for 40 years. The egyptians were a dark skinned people. for Moses to pass as pharaoh's grandson, he had to look like them. You cannot hide a white baby in a black neighborhood. The people who will protest responses like mine simply refuse to belive that the people of Israel can be anyone but them.  But if you look at hisotrical facts and not what you have been taught to believe, you will see  even without arthur Kostlers book that what you have found in your research is true. You may not accept it.,or people may respond to this blog and assure you that your discoveries are false, but it does not make it any less true even if you have a million people say otherwise. If you also notice the  responses the people who agree with your discoveries got thumbs down while the ones who support the traditional and widely accepted views got thumbs up. These people giving the thumbs down  <br>  just refuse to receive the truth. Soon Yah himself will reveal the truth and I dare them to disagree with him! Bless his Holy Name!|`|tfZkjf9Xaa	Shalom.   I'm a Hebrew Israelite that lives in the United States of America,  but am thought of as African-American by European scholarship,  and interpretation of my original identity.  I have the book "The Thirteenth Tribe"  by Arthur Koestler,  but haven't read it in it's entirety.   But I will answer you to the best of my ability,  and in the things the most High has revealed unto me concerning this topic.   It is true that the original descendants of Jacob,  son of Isaac,  who was the covenant son of Abraham are not originally associated with the Greco-Roman culture,  and political systems as are the European Jews.   These original Israelites (Blood descendants of Jacob) are thought of by the most High in scriptures as being like the Ethiopians (Amos 9:7),  they associated themselves with another Hamatic people called Egyptians (Mizriam),  and spent their earliest years as a people guests to this nation.  They spoke,  two Afro-Asiatic languages after the Babylonian captivity (Hebrew,  and Aramiac).   And the physical features of this people biblically,  as well as in archeology show them to be African in features and characteristics.   Most of these people fled the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman general Titus around 70 AD,  and went away from the Roman Empire as much as they could.  They fled into Egypt!.   From Egypt they migrated south,  and westward across Africa.  This is how the prophesy by Moses in Deuteronomy 28:68 was fulfilled in bringing these people back unto Egypt again in ships.  But these original Israelites have a brother/sister nation called Idumea.  This nation (Idumea) has also claimed the identity of Israel,  and this is where the confusion comes from.   The nation of Edom are mostly those of European history that claim to be 'Jews'.  The Edomites were in the land at the time of Yahsua Ha Mashiach (Jesus Christ),  and were the ones that mainly persecuted him (king Herod and also the Scribes, Sadducees, and Pharisees),  eventually having him put to death!  The prophesied Elijah will arise out of the original black Israelites scattered into the western nations being called African-Americans to prove the true covenant peoples.  Also,  Edomites/Idumea are descendants of Esau, Jacobs brother,  but they are not Israel which are the descendants of Jacob.<br>  True,  the curses described in the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy give us the signs of who the true people of Yah really are,  because they would loose their culture in the latter days ("And thou, thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage  that I gave thee;  and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies  in the land which thou knowest not;  for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger,  which sall burn forever"  Jeremiah 17:4).   But the most High has allowed Edom to become a part of the nation of Israel (Deuteronomy 23:7-8) by being able after conversion to enter the congregation of Israel after the third generation.  This happened in history after the Babylonian captivity during the Maccabean period under John Hyrcanus.  But the Edomites eventually took over the political systems of Israel forming covenants with the Greco-Romans,  and causing the original blood descendants of Israel (which were the black descendants of Jacob) to go into captivity in their own land.  Yahshua (Jesus) was rejected by the ruling authorities of his day because he represented these original Israelites,  and posed a threat to the Edomite powers that had usurped the power over Israel because of Greco-Roman favor,  causing the "lost sheep of the house of Israel" much suffering.  This same thing has been happening ever since the time of Messiah,  but is prophesied to end,  and the original descendants of Jacob to get their kingdom back in the latter days  (Book of Obadiah).<br>  <br>  Shalom,<br>  <br>  Melekh

5vYyIflCaa	There's been so much speculation as to the anti-christ's identity through the ages!<br>  <br>  The best way to recognize the counterfeit is to know the truth.<br>  <br>  A personal relationship with the living Lord of the universe will ensure you won't be fooled by any deceiver.<br>  <br>  Jn 10:27 -- My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. 29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. 30 I and my Father are one.<br>  <br>  1 Jn 2:18 -- Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.<br>  <br>  1 Jn 2:22 -- Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.<br>  <br>  1 Jn 4:3 -- And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.<br>  <br>  2 Jn 1:7 -- For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	1 John 2: 22-23<br>  Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist—he denies the Father and the Son. No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.<br>  <br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>
MirV9kSsaa	Salam<br>  <br>  after Istikhara,you should follow the decision that u are strongly inclined to. If u feel no such inclination, then you should choose one of the options; u can rest assured that Allah will guide ur steps.<br>  <br>  ppl misunderstood this prayer,It is NOT at all necessary for a person to have visions or dreams following Istikharah. However, if a person does experience a vision or dream, and he feels strongly about it, he should follow it.<br>  <br>  You may repeat the du`a' of Istikharah several times if you are still hesitant.<br>  <br>  It is reported in a Hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:<br>  <br>   "O Anas, when you intend to do some important things, then seek the good (seek Istikharah) from your Lord seven times and then do that to which your heart (or mind) is inclined, because the good is in it."|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	An-Nawawi holds that "after making istikharah, a person must do what he is wholeheartedly inclined to do and feels good about doing and should not insist on doing what he had desired to do before making the istikharah. And if his feelings change, he should leave what he had intended to do, for otherwise he is not leaving the choice to Allah, and would not be honest in seeking aid from Allah's power and knowledge. Sincerity in seeking Allah's choice, means that one should completely abandon what one desired oneself."|`|g2CZi00Uaa	Apparently you dream the answer or if its a choice you have to make there and then, the choice you make will inshAllah be correct =]|`|pRDKYYV5aa	sleep.<br>  and try and see if u have a dream..i never got any dreams..but my dad gets lots of them after isti5ara! :D|`|mOa7cGlAaa	i don't no if i get the point 'Istikhara", bcs every one say sleep?? is Istikhara mean something other asking god for the best chose??<br>  <br>  my answer<br>  after the prayer Allah give you the power to what you should do.<br>  may the first thing your hard think of it its the most one good for you.<br>  you should accept that this is the best choise.<br>  - and i don't know if we must to do thus or not after the prayer.|`|add7f345d0cac75a0babb600633b560baa	Tell Allah what the problem is. And then you may stay in of Dikr and then go to sleep or do something else.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Don't talk to anybody, make wudhu, engage in Dhikr of Allah and then sleep|`|4aveC2aaaa	sleep<br>  <br>  then you are to dream and interpret your dreams ^_^|`|8FbJjRpwaa	Wait for your answer
qMcTeBavaa	I tend to get even by playing their own game. In your case, I'd go ahead and have a meeting with the head teacher. What I'd do is call and ask for a time when the teacher that dislikes you can be present.<br>  <br>  If he's given your tests and paper back to you, take those with you. The presence of your parents could be helpful. Then you start asking questions that your teacher can't answer. <br>  <br>  Your initial question should be why you're there. Next question, he needs to explain how in an open seating classroom, you adversely affected your friend's score. Then you need to ask him what evidence he has of that. Then you need to ask how he thinks that you caused the death of your friend's stepfather, resulting in her absences.<br>  <br>  And logically, although I know that parent's don't always respond to logic, if you explain it to your parents, they've gotta back you up. If your dad opens the meeting with "Why the hell am I here? Can't you idiots do anything right?" It'll definitely help your case. <br>  <br>  The head teacher will see someone he can't fool with, your teacher will see someone he knows he doesn't want to mess with, not just a teenager that can be brushed under the rug.<br>  <br>  You'll have to apologize for losing your temper and arguing, but I really don't think your teacher is going to be as keen to make your life hell afterwards. And you get to feel smug.<br>  <br>  D|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Maybe you simply need to mature a little and stop disregarding him in class. This means that if he tells you to do something, DO IT instead of ignoring him as you apparently do. Start showing him that you're able to act like an adult who deserves respect, and he might start showing you some respect. Just an option, but it's better than quitting the class isn't it?|`|ssV4NDUVaa	Not at all! Fight for it! You spent so much energy and mental frustration at the guy, don't let it go to waste. You said it yourself that you're "good at it."<br>  <br>  You can lay low for a while, and get high grades to shut him up. For the meantime that is... >:)|`|gqaZP4R3aa	sum of my teachers hate me. if they tell me 2 do something i dont do it and i said i hated u 2 one of my history teacher 2 hahah idc.|`|r5BB6CwGaa	Well i think you should respect your teacher first off, bit i uinderstand you dilema, next time bring it up with the higher autority first instead of cursing of arguing, thats what i do, and as long as your justified and organized when you approch your principal or offical they should be more than happy to listen and resolve the problem, sorry but in your situation just kiss ***, next time play your cards better.|`|uvo24D2gaa	lool i had the same problem with my maths teacher  <br>    just do your work and show it to the head <br>  ur teacher is a bored person and just wants to argue get all your class m8s and ask them to back you up and complain bout that teacher if you want things to really improve|`|QZvvHp3iaa	Screw him, when I was in school there was this one teacher who just couldn't stand the sight of me. Advanced spanish....grr I was really good at it but I dropped it for drawing, I met the best people in my life there. I didn't regret it one bit, Adios Puta!|`|ogZJhGX5aa	report this a---h--- to the school board|`|VgpQMDpjaa	wow ummm that girls answer is rude... what a b*** ... you need to fight|`|gKrcJyoxaa	you should tell your head teacher everything you just said here and hopefully then it will be sorted out. <br>  <br>  teachers aren't allowed to show favoritism in front of their students, and it is a VERY serious offense if a teacher is purposefully picking on a particular student for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  saying this, maybe you should evaluate how you work in the class, are you a distraction to that girl? if you find that you 2 are always chatting and joking around then it is in your best interest to sit away from each other so that you both work better (to be fair though, in your position there is no way i would move and i would tell the head teacher)|`|aPcw0sz7aa	I would just be a big suck up to him. Just listen to everything he says, start to ask him how his day is and stuff. Eventually he will start to be cool and then thats when you can get away with some things lol|`|LURqbzoZaa	Aww. Well i wouldnt quit the class if you like it and are good at it. Dont let him win.
hL5Kjdk8aa	Depends on if they knew they had it or not and if I really loved them. I'd just get me some valtrax and hope that I dont have a bad case of them. Could be worse things out there.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	I'd leave him...because I would know that if that were the case that he had cheated on me.<br>  I would also tell everyone that he has herpes! And then when they found out that he gave them to me...well...I guess I'd play victim. <br>  <br>  Yeah...I guess I'd just move away...hell I don't know what I would do.|`|5tY3eZcoaa	Sorry but if not protected(always am) we both are getting tested. If I were to catch Herpes, can't do anything foolish that would have me in jail.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hey disagree, maybe some of you should stop being so naive, and worrying about breaking it off with people so much, doing it raw, then regret once the consequences are you have a disease.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Some of these answers disgust me but I can understand.<br>  <br>  I personally would be so pissed that I would go into a rage but I wouldn't physically assault anyone, the relationship will be over and I co sign ceasaria I would try and sue and get back at them as much as I can.<br>  <br>  Interesting fact Zoe, I hope some of these people up in here know this Lol.|`|Thw2IgxQaa	If my boyfriend gave me herpes best believe my foot would be up his as s. I may not win the fight but please believe I'm gettin some punches in. lol. If it was curable then I wouldn't be so bad but you can't get rid of that.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	lol johnnys wifey, johnny not throwing down in the bedroom correctly or what ?|`|ugdutKAnaa	I'd press charges with attempted murder ...I'd try anyway to alleviate the pain.|`|pfke6Jieaa	i would break up with her on the spot to be honest. but it would be hard if im married.|`|XcNpRYqtaa	well for one you need to consult your doctor immediately and have him prescribe something to suppress the virus and protect you from break outs. remember herpes cannot be cure but doesn't mean you cant continue living. You should try talking to the person who u suspect gave u the virus and have them see a doctor for treatment.<br>  the only safe sex is abstain from sex itself and no method is 100% effective.|`|5pxZfnjMaa	I would try my best to give them Cancer or Small Pox, maybe I would take responsibility for being a whore.  GOD, why are we as a people so ignorant.  We have no one to blame except ourselves for anything bad that happens.  Just grin and bear it baby, you asked for it.  I smell something sizzling, oh that's her pus.....LOL.  Like lil weezy said, "I'm not sick, I'm ill."  PEACE and chicken grease.|`|npTZTzWRaa	what I would most likely do is illegal and would result in life in prison if I got caught, one would have to have connections who are heavy in the streets to have the means  to get away with what I would do|`|oHvmqpxmaa	Fun fact: Knowingly passing on sexually transmitted diseases <br>  is a crime in most states in America.<br>  <br>  You can go to prison if you are found guilty of this. <br>  I consider it a heinous crime.|`|cdy5uIE5aa	Sorry to hear that.  Sucks to be you.|`|bpr0ONbAaa	Divorce them or break up with them. Put a poster on their back saying "SHE IS SLUT"|`|ka6lb9nXaa	punch them in the face !<br>  and pass it on to their friends and family :)|`|DhffKJreaa	I'd be pissed|`|pDmTRG82aa	Cuss her out and call her a slut. I still wouldnt do anything like what Chris Brown did to Rihanna|`|JTQOTrrFaa	give it back.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	Married or not that relationship's over.|`|PvPPivLJaa	I'd sue because i'm assuming he knew he had it. Michael Vick got sued for this very reason: <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0405051vick1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/040...</a>|`|WAoNhHB1aa	If there was a possibility that they may have herpes, I probably wouldn't be having sex with them in the first place...<br>  <br>  Also, what lover?  My love life sucks and my sex life doesn't exist.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Not possible because I always practice safe sex.|`|JO8YzDNVaa	I'd say no thank you, and hand it back.
9XJLlPaEaa	Legally, no, that argument is not a legal argument.|`|93r3nCM1aa	That's a pretty weak argument.<br>  <br>  American psuedo-democracy is filled with people making decisions for other people.<br>  <br>  Just look at the presidential election...when you vote for president, you're making a choice based on what YOU think is best for the country...and other people who didn't vote for your candidate have to live with yours (and others) vote.<br>  <br>  Even though gay marriage doesn't affect those people in a literal sense, I don't deny that homophobes are deeply perturbed by gay marriage...so technically it DOES affect them.<br>  <br>  But what it comes down to is, regardless of who it affects and who it doesn't affect, is the vote constitutional.<br>  <br>  Is it constitutional to remove the civil liberties of a minorty group of people simply because YOU personally find it reprehensible? NO!<br>  <br>  Edit: actually, polygamous marriages ARE your business, especially when it comes to the polygamous couples/families receiving extra tax credit simply for having an extra wife. That's an entirely different matter. Gay marriage still only involves 2 people...but polygamy starts really complicating taxes, benefits, etc. I don't care if people want to be in polygamous, non-marital RELATIONSHIP, but I maintain that it should remain illegal to have more than 1 spouse.|`|2RzEaod9aa	You have a very good point. Bring it up to a California congressperson.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Hey george,<br>  <br>  Your bigotry is showing yet again.<br>  <br>  I am certain that comment is inaccurate and simply filtered through your bigotry.<br>  <br>  Blessings!|`|g0lKlQGnaa	I would argue that no group of people has the right to vote on the rights of an exclusive minority group.  Every single right should apply to all peoples<br>  <br>  Thus if 'A' can marry, then 'B' can, and 'C' can.....etc..|`|AA10067344	From a legal standpoint, no that argument does not hold up.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Welcome to the world of rationalism. Too bad christians don't live here too.|`|AA11506647	That is not a constitutional argument. The motives of the voter are irrelevant.<br>  <br>  One could make the same argument about any sort of victimless crime including drug use, prostitution and suicide. Are all the laws against these behaviors unconstitutional as well?<br>  <br>  Don't ge me wrong, I think gay marriage should be legal. However, that is not what the voters of California decided. If the supreme court simply overturns laws because they disagree with them then we loose all moral claim to be a democracy. That and nothing less than that is what is at stake.|`|AA11946554	I'm with you on this. It's none of my business and the people who vote against are too *bleeping* blind to see their own hatred. As far as I'm concerned, Prop. 8 IS unconstitutional anyway b/c it threatens a person's 'pursuit of happiness'...I am aware that murder or child molestation violates others rights but any sexual act between two consenting adults should be allowed. It is, as far as the Constitution is concerned.<br>  Ugh. I am so tired of the extremely ignorant who are able to vote. There should be a reading comprehension test to get a voting license!|`|FhHklqkhaa	smrtblndie - separate isn't equal plus why would people in a same-sex relationship or into the same-sex wanna marry someone of the opposite sex? you are discriminating plus it is about rights<br>  the bigots are arrogant and want to be in control and let anything they hate happen<br>  I still think the majority voting on rights is wrong<br>  plus the judges are there to uphold the laws and they should vote against this as it is very unlawful I think, would it be ok to deny straight couples marriage?<br>  edit: Jim who owns a house is not decided by sexuality, it's free to anyone who can afford it, people though are not houses and are meant  to be equal under the law with the same rights|`|AA11989999	Whether some law affects some voter or group of voters is irrelevant. Thus an Equal Rights Amendment is not voted on solely by women. In a democracy, except for fundamental rights and freedoms, the majority is always affecting the minority--just as a narrow majority who were pro-Iraq War decided it for everyone else. <br>    I  agree that it's a matter of marriage being both civil and religious in nature, while a "civil union" can only be one. And I resist the notion that insurance and other benefits should decide things. The tax code is written AROUND and CONSIDERING society as it is, not vice versa. And just because said code has some benefits for homeowners or other groups, does not mean everyone has the constitutional right to own a house.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	That actually is a god argument, just not worded well. Perhaps there was more said around it that I'm missing. basically, what they're saying is that the vote took away a legally recognized right from a minority group. Since those voting the right away had no vested interest in the right, they had no right to vote this right away from those who did have an interest in it.|`|aogwoFKJaa	I hear Ellen is very upset about this.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  This is the equivalent of saying 'you are the minority, and we mean for you to stay that way'.|`|2e32cb845aff394a45c9eb8c88a2793aaa	you could use that logic for a number of things...becareful what you wish for you just might get it...|`|AA11937917	It makes sense from the point of view that anyone not gay, who would not be participating in gay marriage, would (and should) have no standing to participate in any action against it.<br>  <br>  I have no right to sue against Bob because Bob wrecked your car (hypothetical situation, of course), but you do - because you are affected. I have no standing; I was not harmed - it was not my car, I was not a passenger or witness, nor did it damage any of my property or family.<br>  <br>  Same thing... except states with referendum laws can leave themselves open to 'mob rule' mentalities like was saw with Prop H8.<br>  <br>  To be fair, Cali and similar states should now hold a vote for gay people to decide if straight marriage is allowable.|`|DFkoruA6aa	Here's the crux of the matter. <br>  <br>  'Marriage' is a religious function.<br>  <br>  A 'Civil Union' is not. Some one remind me at which point we made it okay for the government to dictate (based on popular vote or not) how religions can be practiced and which religious functions apply to which people. The law is unconstitutional because it addresses religious matters. Screw everything else.|`|DlK8XEJRaa	Jesus Christ most of you people are so fricken emotional about this issue you've lost all sight of legality.  Any man, gay or not, can marry any willing woman. ANY man, gay nor not, is prevented from marrying another man. There is zero discrimination.  All legal benefits of marriage are available in a domestic relationship.  It's all about a title, and that is not, not, NOT a fricken right or civil liberty.<br>  <br>  Just that fact alone negate your entirely inane premise.  I completely believe you watched it live, I just think you completely misunderstood the argument.<br>  .|`|mFGyonmTaa	You know something some fundie said once hit me as interesting...<br>  <br>  He said that polygamy does not directly affect people in America, yet we illegalize it...<br>  <br>  I got to thinking that polygamy, well, I personally feel it is unecessary and "morally" incorrect...<br>  <br>  And if a man next door were living with 18-20 wives I'd be kinda disturbed...<br>  <br>  So, am I being hypocritical when I agree with you? I'm just wondering...<br>  <br>  (Like is polygamy WRONG? Homosexuals aren't "wrong", they're just unique people...)<br>  <br>  Edit: but what if...never mind I'm gonna make this an actual question...|`|NXCMRb8waa	Prop 8 was a disgrace to America and everything it was based upon. It's a shameful display of ignorance, bigotry , intolerance, fear, lies and religious aggression.|`|fc9oxG8iaa	Welcome to democracy. Asking you for what doesn't apply to you, and ignoring you when something does.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	My rights should NEVER be put up for a vote!  It's pissing me off more and more!|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	You watched it too, eh? Wasn't it just painful? :|<br>  <br>  It makes perfect sense. Unless they have friends and family who are gay, then it's really none of their business... And honestly, if they have friends and family who are gay, they should be SUPPORTING the right for gays to marry. :/ Not rallying against it. Legal crap aside, it's just unethical to deny a group of people their rights because they're not like you, especially if what they want to do doesn't hurt you at all.<br>  <br>  All it is, is a vicious, small minded attack on a group of people the majority dislike for whatever reason. It doesn't affect these people either way-- they'll still be able to marry who they like. Yet they choose to be hateful and vote against gay people just because they don't like gay marriage.<br>  <br>  Here's to hoping the CSSC listened and overturns Prop 8... :/ <br>  <br>  I wish Obama would just legalize gay marriage federally and get it over with.
R5UIMBvcaa	Think what case the long a's make those two nouns.  Now just look very closely at the verb--tense, mood, person, number--and be sure you're giving it the right subject.  What's it's object?  And how could "fierce fame" fit into that picture?  Suppose the phrase were genitive rather than the case its in--would that help?|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	I suppose you could observe it. ∠°)|`|icEMyJBoaa	Hate to burst your bubble, but if it's a take-home exam, you shouldn't be asking other people for help....

lvBUl3Zdaa	Find a way to get used to it. It's always been that way. There is nothing you can do to change it. But if you feel people bring up religion too much around you, perhaps you are unwittingly starting the discussion yourself. ∠°)|`|67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	I'm on the same page with you as far as the tolerance issue. I'm a pagan and I don't care if the Ten Commandments are openly displayed in a court of law. I have no problem with calling the Winter Solstice Christmas. I will bow my head while someone is praying out of respect.<br>  <br>  Actually I think that's the key word-- respect. No one has any respect for others' boundaries much less their spiritual persuasion. I do get angry with people blindly bashing people like me and saying I'm going to go to hell or that I "worship the devil". Hell, I don't even believe in the devil...but my point is, I don't think anyone needs to bash someone else over a force, entity or other manifestation (real or imagined) that you can't even see!<br>  <br>  I am tolerant to all religious factions as long as they aren't violent. I just don't understand how I am a pagan and follow the teachings of Christ moreso than His own self professed flock of sheep. That kinda makes me wonder....actually no, it doesn't.

Sadly, even in this multi-faith society, not everything seems to be what it is. Yes, there are people who think they're above others. Yes, we live in a high, middle, and low class society. I can only imagine why we are taught to adhere to certain standards in society, just because everyone else is doing it. <br>  <br>  But when it comes to religion, it is one that is truly spiritual. And as much as people will say their religion(s) is/are better than others, they uphold that belief and value strongly. And there's nothing much you can do to bypass that 'strong belief' without having them disciminate you. <br>  <br>  A sad world, indeed.... it is a very sad place to be. I guess what separate us from everyone else are simply....'individual differences'. You have right, left, liberal, conservatives, christians, buddhists, muslims, high class, low class, doctors, lawyers, janitors, etc. The list goes on and on. <br>  <br>  I have a brother who is studying in medical school. I'm an architect, by the way. It seems, as though, my parents value his hard work more than mine. And in some cases, my brother expresses too much pride in going to one of the most well known medical schools. He upholds this knowledge that he is 'above' others and 'knows everything.' I'm more passionate and don't really see others as low or high as me. <br>  <br>  You are a victim of religious discrimination. No doubt. You have taken it personally and it has affected your self esteem. Even worst, you are angry. But what purpose does it serve to be angry? My point is, don't take it personally. You are your own person. <br>  <br>  Remember, it goes back to how we're all different and stick with our own kind. I guess everyone does that out of 'fear'. They often fear the unknown. They are afraid that people unlike them can't understand them. And as far as I'm concern, this has been going on for centuries. <br>  <br>  But what I find most interesting..... is why and how we are raised to be this way. As adults, we realize that there are forces at work that separate a variety of people. And I'm not sure if this world can truly exist without all the bloodshed, discrimination, and hate that are so evident in this society today. <br>  <br>  I guess when you open up and teach people something they don't know, you just have to 'hope' they'll learn something from you and respect your differences. <br>  <br>  WE all could use a little more respect these days.... and I honestly think that is what we need to work on. However, I don't think a lot of people can because they're victims, like yourself. Everyone's a victim and there's some serious damage to our self esteem going through that. All it takes is to grow out of it... to love yourself... and to forget and forgive. <br>  <br>  Good luck and god bless....|`|5hD0alFyaa	Why not?

Televangelists often ask viewers to pray a Sinner's Prayer with them, phrase at a time, to become a Christian. Quite commonly, such a prayer appears at the conclusion of a tract and is recited in a religious service or other public service as an invitation for congregants to affirm their faith, sometimes as part of an altar call.<br>  <br>  There is also no such thing as "once saved, always saved".  I hear people say this a lot, but the Bible does not say that.|`|qOGh6ODLaa	The Sinner's Prayer:<br>  "Modern apostasy and false teaching that prevents men from being saved."<br>  The earliest notion of sinners prayer is less than 500 years old. It wasn't formalized as a theology until around the time of Billy Graham.<br>  <br>  No one in the Bible ever prayed for their initial salvation. They did however believe, repent, confess Jesus and be immersed in water for the forgiveness of their sins. The sinners prayer is a an innovation that thwarts God's plan of salvation. First they replaced believers baptism by immersion with infant baptism by sprinkling. Second they later replaced baptism altogether with the "sinners prayer" so that baptism is no longer even part of the plan of salvation. If you prayed the "sinners prayer" for your salvation, you are still lost in your sins, because it is not what God said to do.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Who cares who wrote it and preached it, according to these fools it is the only way to be saved.

If you prayed the "sinners prayer" for your salvation, you are still lost in your sins, because it is not what God said to do. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Sinner's Prayer<br>  <br>  C.S. Lewis used the term "a great cataract of nonsense" to describe how people use a modern idea to construe Bible theology. One such example, perhaps the best example, is a conversion method called the Sinner's Prayer. It is more popularly known as the Four Spiritual Laws. <br>  <br>  Lewis used this term to describe what happens when someone looks backward at the Bible based only on what he or she has known. Instead, an evangelical should first discern conversion practices from Scriptures and then consider the topic in light of two thousand years of other thinkers. As it is, a novel technique popularized through recent revivals has replaced the biblically sound practice.<br>  <br>  Today, hundreds of millions hold to a belief system and salvation practice that no one had ever held until relatively recently. The notion that one can pray Jesus into his or her heart and that baptism is merely an outward sign are actually late developments. The prayer itself dates to the Billy Sunday era; however, the basis for talking in prayer for salvation goes back a few hundred years. <br>  <br>  Consider the following appeal: <br>  <br>  "Just accept Christ into your heart through prayer and he'll receive you. It doesn't matter what church you belong to or if you ever do good works. You'll be born again at the moment you receive Christ. He's at the door knocking. You don't even have to change bad habits, just trust Christ as Savior. God loves you and forgives you unconditionally. Anyone out there can be saved if they ... Accept Christ, now! Let us pray for Christ to now come into your heart." <br>  <br>  Sound familiar? This method of conversion has had far-reaching effects worldwide as many have claimed this as the basis for their salvation. Yet, what is the historical significance of this conversion? How did the process of rebirth, which Jesus spoke of in John 3, evolve into praying him into one's heart? I believe it was an error germinating shortly after the Reformation, which eventually caused great ruin and dismay in Christendom. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bible.ca/g-sinners-prayer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.ca/g-sinners-prayer.htm</a>

AA12181796	If you think that ridding your son of "abominable thoughts" should be higher up God's list of priorities than curing someone of cancer, you are seriously selfish and messed up.<br>  <br>  Of course, the real answer to your question is that there is no God, so he cannot answer any prayers. Getting cancer is unlucky, not due to sin, and your suggestion that she deserved it is disgusting. Likewise, getting through cancer is lucky and due to the hard work of doctors and scientists, not prayer.|`|WalnRzfGaa	maybe because there is no God and your son with think what he wants and the atheist lady had good doctors.<br>  <br>  you know what else is an abomination according to your beliefs?

AA11374522	Research backs up the idea that gays and lesbians can make fitting parents. A 2003 study by Golombok and a 2006 study by Patterson found that the adjustment and mental health of children in lesbian and gay families are no different from those of children in heterosexual families. Research regarding gay and lesbian parents is young, but from what we've seen homosexuals are every bit as qualified in parenting ability as heterosexuals.<br>  <br>  As far as concerns about peer relations goes, there is also research that indicates that children with same-sex parents are similar in social behavior and receive as much social acceptance as children with opposite-sex parents.|`|0wTzlG2haa	The reality is that studies have been done which show that there is no difference in the psychological makeup of children raised in families with heterosexual parents and children raised in families with gay parents.<br>  <br>  That said, I have two personal experiences to share. The first is a colleague that I worked with for a few years. She and her siblings (a sister and brother) were raised in a home with two moms. I've met all of them at some point or another. All are well-adjusted, happy adults. Only her sister is gay. She and her brother are both straight.<br>  <br>  The second personal experience is that my partner and I have twin sons who I carried and my partner was later able to adopt in a "second parent" adoption. They are preschoolers now and are very polite, respectful and caring kids. They hold their own in school but psychologically and intellectually. We are constantly being told by their teachers and people at our church was well behaved, and great kids they are. They have plenty of male role models so I'm not at all concerned about them having a "balance" in their lives.

More than half of the children born to a "stable" married couple wind up living with just one parent before they are 15.  While living with both both parents imagine the rough years the children lived through before the final divorce.  <br>  <br>  Normal straight is just as oxymoron a statement as  normal gay. <br>  <br>  In my gay community there are many friends and a good portion of my natural family which acted in the office of the other spouse.  My first lover had always wanted children and was a great "uncle" to my two under 12 year olds.  He died suddenly of a heart attack.  Four years later I met my present partner (more than a lover!) and he "adopted" my two teenagers.  Even now after 20 years he has a wonderful relationship with OUR children.  In fact, the kids, now in their 30's, have a much better relationship with him than with their natural mother who they choose not to see for years at a time!!!<br>  <br>  AS for men and women complimenting each other - that generally is not what I see today.  Husbands and wives actually seem to live two separate lives and only return as a couple periodically. So many of the straight folks I know even take separate vacations.<br>  <br>  My partner and I really do get along so much better than other couples we know.  and they hold us up as examples of what any good relationship should look like.  I am lucky to have such a great man in my life.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend that there is no guarantee who will be a good parent, or even what a good example of a committed relationship looks like in either the gay or straight community.  And he is stereotyping people without any proof of what he is say actually exists today.  There are good people who make great parents who never get married (straight/gay).  And there certainly on whole bunches of people who are legally married who never should be allowed to even babysit children of any age.<br>  <br>  Happy arguing.

No one ever in history ever claimed that God wrote the book but I do believe that people who believed in him believed they were inspired by God to write the bible. Considering the span of time in which the bible was written (yes I have studied biblical theology) it has a surprising amount of cohesiveness and I'm talking about the Greek/hebrew based bible that has little influence from the roman catholics. <br>  <br>  As far as believing in the bible, I find that an odd question. I believe that it is a guide book for our lives, since it has good morals and ethics that many people should live by in my personal opinion. However I don't believe that it should dictate our lives. My biggest problem lies with churches but that's a whole other topic. <br>  <br>  <br>  Side note: If you want to people to take your question seriously I recommend not writing so much shorthand in your question. It doesn't sound serious in the least.|`|zAzZ3xcOaa	That must be the oddest thing i have read but i am afraid you are right. God did not write the Bible...

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	God suspends His omnipotence in deference to our free will.  That is the honor and responsibility that we get as His children.<br>  <br>  His  only plan laid out for us is for us to use our free will wisely and to love one another in thought and action.<br>  <br>  I know that many people, for many centuries, have said that God has a plan for everybody and that nothing happens outside of His agency.  To me that is a basic, callow theology.  It is similar to the same kind of superstitous thinking that says God hardens people's hearts then punishes them for it, or that God can see into a future that hasn't happened yet.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	You are thinking on the wrong level.

Because you know you don't really want to hear the truth.  Because you mistakenly determine that the two explanations you gave contradict, you really believe that there is no viable response?<br>  <br>  It's pretty evident that we do have "Free Will" in life.  You have the right to  either consider yourself a homosexual or an adulterer, or a thief or you have the free will not to commit those actions.  Either way, they all come with a cost! <br>  <br>  God's plan for my life was laid out long before I began planning it my ownself,  Each time that my ideas and plans didn't coincide with God's thoughts and wishes for me, I hit those walls or barriers or saw no or little success.  Each time that I applied my "free will" and didn't fight my intuitions ( which are really God's wishes for us) and stayed on the path God wanted for me, I noted it much easier and seemed to be smoother sailing than what I thought was best for my life.  <br>  <br>  Let's look at it in the larger scheme of life.  Let's look at the U.S. in all its confusion.  Many say we are copying Europe's agenda almost exactly and all we have to do is look at their failures to see what we can expect of our own future.  It is beginning to come to past.  <br>  <br>  Let's suppose God has a different plan for our country and its peoples.  I have to believe HE has since before there was America, we were looking at many communities of countries who wanted something better than what they were having; where most came from Europe, (sound familiar) and wanted to begin a life and government of their own.  Now we see ourselves molding and rescending to the errors of the same countries and peoples who we originally left from the start of this Country to begin with.  <br>  <br>  All to say, We have the same "Free Will" as a nation and a World, NOT to repeat the same mistakes that our predicessors made, if we adhere to the "will" or "intentions" that our Lord God has for us.  <br>  <br>  The longer you live in denial, the longer it will take our people to see that God has the better plan for His people.<br>  <br>  P.S. I noted a gentleman (bixxb) has called me to the carpet and called me a "Liar" before you.  He pretends to be an atheist, but my guess is he himself gave up on God at some point because God did not grant him 3 wishes that he may have wanted in his life.  That seems to be the story of many atheists across the board.  <br>  <br>  In response to his calling me a liar when I noted that God has "warned" man about sin and the occurrances in the U.S. on many occasions, he remarked that I was lying, and that God has not made any statements in the past 2000 years.  Well, if you choose to believe that God does not know the past, present and future , then that would probably be correct or perhaps NOT.  But God DID in fact make note of "warnings" and you only have to search your index in any Bible or even on any web site , and search "warnings from God" and to your amazement.....there it will show that I in fact , am NOT a liar.  <br>  <br>  Mr. bxxb,  is attempting to confuse and cast his demons on our work, and God simply will not allow it !|`|XxWovDNCaa	When a being says "you have the freedom to love and worship me or burn in hell forever" that's not free will. That's blackmail.|`|X1jupF0paa	just because he draws you a map doesn't mean you have to follow it.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	It doesn't seem to me that there's anything particularly complicated about this.  From what I can tell, we have free will, and that means that we can and do make choices about all kinds of things in our lives, both big and small, and that includes whether or not we believe God exists.  The idea that God is somehow limited by a certain set of rules or whatever is a human limitation that many people want to attribute to and blame on God, and it says more about the people putting forth those viewpoints than it says about the nature of a Supreme Being.  In your mind, this may be a contradiction, but maybe there are some things in our lives that are not about making "either/or" choices.  Best wishes to you!|`|BIcwYuLBaa	the idea is that God gave everyone freewill so that we could make our own decisions, i.e. we can do whatever we want including sinning but we are also free to choose to follow him. he also has a plan for our lives but if we want to we can choose not to follow it. Providence only works if you try your hardest to follow Gods will.<br>  <br>  God Bless<br>  L|`|03rOCajTaa	Ya I'm just wondering how many paths is written.... ok?....<br>  God knows each path we would take....crap<br>  I don't know the whole bible thing is confusing..double standards, contradicting<br>  <br>  its written bye man so that explains it all so don't take it to personal I guess<br>  I'll just do whats right in my heart and try to do no wrong and love people of all nationalities and faiths|`|ctOge9SLaa	In this universe there are only three wills.<br>  God's will<br>  Satan's will<br>  Man's will<br>  <br>  Two were already in effect when man was created. Yet, in all fairness to man, God created him, not as a robot, but with the ability to choose.  You have exercised that very will to post this kind of question and every day you and I continue to display the ability God has bestowed upon each person.<br>  <br>  Unlike us, God looks on into the heart of men and women.   He sees things from a perspective that we can never begin to see.  We see things outwardly, even are limited by time and space. God sees things from the heart first, then the actions, He sees things from eternity past to eternity future. <br>  <br>  There is actually no contradiction, the contradiction comes only because we have yet to understand God's mind.  We are finite persons, limited by many things.  So where on the one hand God may seem like He has mapped out everything, on the other hand, we say that He has given us a will to choose.  The thing is, both are very accurate.  He can't help being God with the ability to see into the future, He knew that you would make the choices that you do each day. He also knows whether you would be one to side with the will of Satan or with the Will of God. In this life there are only two options for man. He is the middle " will' betwixt these two strong wills. <br>  <br>  I am just glad that God has looked into my own heart and saw that there was some kind of desire for Him.  That in time, I did have a response to Him inspite of my stubbornness.  Each day, I want to ask Him to strengthen me to choose Him.  I don't want to fight with Him and debate so much that I miss the point of my existence.  I just want to love God and live for Him.  I also know what it is like to be bullied and taken advantage of by satan.  He does not offer anything lasting. He tempts us , misrepresents himself, puts questions in our mind, messes with our thoughts and in the end, chews us out and spits us out and then says" Here God.. see what You can do with her!"<br>  <br>  No more of that for me.

AA10066367	First, the Church has admitted that she was wrong, just not on matters of Doctrine or Dogma - on those she is infalliable.<br>  <br>  Secondly, and to answer your question, before the formal canonization process began in the fifteenth century, many saints were proclaimed by popular approval. This was a much faster process but unfortunately many of the saints so named were based on legends, pagan mythology, or even other religions -- for example, the story of the Buddha traveled west to Europe and he was "converted" into a Catholic saint! In 1969, the Church took a long look at all the saints on its calendar to see if there was historical evidence that that saint existed and lived a life of holiness. In taking that long look, the Church discovered that there was little proof that many "saints", including some very popular ones, ever lived. Christopher was one of the names that was determined to have a basis mostly in legend. Therefore Christopher (and others) were dropped from the universal calendar. <br>  <br>  So yes, some Saints have been removed.<br>  <br>  If, however, there are miracles associated with them, and the process was followed - then they are to remain a Saint.  Look at St. Joan d'Arc.  She was hardly a model of Christian ideology (killing how many in war), but still a Saint.|`|8f4f74b888ea52c3281d7e660fc03550aa	Does anybody still pay attention to that stuff?|`|AA11439912	One the Catholic Church does not admit errors and two if they did most saints would have to be "de-canonized"|`|fa0fa5ff3aeece2e81ca180577667838aa	The Catholic Church would have to admit that they were wrong to canonize those people.

The lives of the saints was about the only part of Catholicism I like long ago.  They were lovely stories.  <br>  I believe old John Paul II abolished the office of Devils Advocate (yes it was real) that was supposd to argue evidence against the canidate's sainthood.  John Paul II loved saints and would cannonize at the drop of his big ol pointy hat.  And he would drop the hat.   In 25 years he may have cannonized more than any other pope.<br>  Bennedict the XVI likes saints too<br>   But the Rev. C. John McCloskey, pastor at a Washington D.C., Catholic outreach center, likes to quote the pope's confidante, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger: "When someone complained the pope was naming too many saints," he recalls, "Cardinal Ratzinger replied, 'There cannot be too many saints.' " After all, McCloskey says, "making saints is the purpose of the church."|`|AA12328811	I would presume so.

And Santa is nowhere to be found in the Bible.<br>  <br>  The only thing that has any mention in the Bible is Jesus' birth.  However, that story indicates that Jesus was born in the spring, and it was written decades after Paul wrote about Jesus.

d4e173ca2aeaa15a3cdcfd9288ac3f68aa	Your boss is silly, a bad Jew, and is ranting about a half remembered custom because he's forgotten all the rest.<br>  <br>  Here's how it works: When somebody dies in the family, the custom is to cover all mirrors in the house for 7 days. This shows that the feeling of loss has replaced any concern for personal vanity.<br>  <br>  Some people, not knowing the reason for the custom, took to covering photographs at this time too. There is no reason for this in Jewish Law. It's a silly custom, or minhag shtoos, if you want to know the technical term for such a custom in Jewish law. (Remember it, you can tell him.)<br>  <br>  Now here's the real kicker: Ikher Halakhah, the basic Jewish law, forbids photographs of human beings that show more than half the person, or images of the face except for profiles. It's considered idolatrous. You can find this law in Shulchan Aruch, Yorah Deah, Hilchos Avodah Zorah. (Remember that, you can tell him.)<br>  <br>  Tell your boss you covered the pictures to honor his faith as you knew from the COde of Jewish law in Shulchan Aruch, Yorah Deah, Hilchos Avodah Zorah that Jewish law considers an image of the human face except in profile or with a detail missing idolatrous.<br>  <br>  Also tell him that saying the Fword is considered "Nivul Peh" and Jewish law maintains that "Nivul Peh" (bad language) leads to the death of children.|`|7faa6c450d7756c69dcba5b22f24a4d2aa	Not against the religion, but custom states you only cover pictures when some one dies.

The issue lies with thier religious leaders and the indocrination techniques they use on the younger generations. If you grow up being taught to hate, when you have matured, it seems the right thing to do. Violence also works as a excellent medium for them to convey thier message because it grabs headlines and scares people. People will always respect one thing: FEAR. If they can keep thier followers cowed and subdued, they can continue to spew this vitrolic from thier minarets. It is not to hard to take a uneducated individual, who already has a bleak picture in front of him/her and offer them a way to "change" it. In the minds of these lost souls, violence is the end to all means, and whatever thier Imam says, is the one true way to fix their bleak world. The word of man (The Iraqi Government) cannot compete with the word of god (Violent Islam). You should watch the movie "Syriana".

All Muslims know, if you make fun of either Islam, or the Prophet (Mohammad), you have a big problem. An Associated Press article on Thursday September 21, 2006 reported on a meeting of about 1,000 Muslim clerics and religious scholars in Eastern Pakistan. The clerics had met in response to comments made by the Pope. The scholars said, "Infidels, should know that no Muslim, under any circumstances, can tolerate an insult to the Prophet (Muhammad)." They went on to say, "If the West does not change its stance regarding Islam, it will face severe consequences." What do these Muslim scholars mean? <br>  <br>  Most non-Muslims are unaware of how important this issue is. But to Muslims, it is a fact of life. If you some how insult Islam, in any way, shape of form, there is a good chance that some unseen, deeply devout, Muslim believer will come out of the woodwork and kill you. It's that simple. These devout killers are simply a fact of Islamic life. As a result, inside Islamic society, virtually no one freely criticizes Islam. That's what the scholars meant.|`|e946eb2cd6ce2ec8ba1b6ba12a0b08cdaa	because they are barbarians and think like cowards.  they do not know any other way and should be erased from the earth.  than we can all live in peace.|`|fdc452f3b6c298df75d098dcc6971315aa	I am Muslim, and I could care less if you believe what I tell you.

There ARE muslims out there who think that no matter what, they HAVE to change the world, right now, and they are the ones to do it, and I dissagree with the fighting and bombing, as do almost every single Muslim I know of, so stop lalbeling us ALL together, just as MUSLIMS, and talk about THE muslims who are doing bad things, not the ones who are not...

ONLY.<br>  <br>  i can't really make a call on the women there. they seem to show a range on television from the burly outdoors woman to the fragile thin rich daughter HOWEVER none of them show that stupidity that a/b women showcase on a daily basis like jessican simpson, paris hilton, britney spears etc etc etc. <br>  <br>  of course under it all, i feel there isn't much of a real difference. but that's why they call it a stereotype.|`|4b04ef6464f88b95de18c6aada332187aa	I just think of you as having an accent and living on beaches, and being laid back, I don't think of you guys of being serious all the time, well I dont think of anyplace being serious all the time but, you guys just seem very calm and nice, and I think of kangaroos when I think of Australia because they're my favorite animals.|`|7faa6c450d7756c69dcba5b22f24a4d2aa	Well, judging from the Aussies I've met, there is no typical Australian.

Supper and dinner have, in modern times as people have migrated off of the farm and into the city, become somewhat interchangeable, especially in the urban centers.<br>  <br>  The etymology of the word "lunch" is interesting:<br>  lunch·eon  (lnchn)  n.<br>  1.

The word retains this original application with those who use dinner as the name of the mid-day meal; with those who ‘dine’ in the evening, luncheon denotes a meal (understood to be less substantial and less ceremonious than dinner) taken usually in the early afternoon.<br>  <br>  Dinner: The is the chief meal of the day, eaten originally, and still by the majority of people, about the middle of the day, but now, by the professional and fashionable classes, usually in the evening; particularly, a formally arranged meal of various courses; a repast given publicly in honour of some one, or to celebrate some event.<br>  <br>  Tea: A meal or social entertainment at which tea is served; especially an ordinary afternoon or evening meal, at which the usual beverage is tea (but sometimes cocoa, chocolate, coffee, or other substitute). Now usually a light meal in the late afternoon, but locally in the U.K. (especially northern), and in Australia and N.Z., a cooked evening meal; in Jamaica, the first meal of the day.<br>  <br>  Supper: The last meal of the day; (contextually) the hour at which this is taken, supper-time; also, such a meal made the occasion of a social or festive gathering. Often without article, demonstrative, possessive, or the like, esp. when governed by a prep. (to have supper; at, to, for, after supper).<br>  <br>  Formerly, supper was the last of the three meals of the day (breakfast, dinner, and supper); now applied to the last substantial meal of the day when dinner is taken in the middle of the day, or to a late meal following an early evening dinner.

The Druze community can be found primarily in Lebanon in West Beirut, the Shuf Mountains, the Al Matn district and the regions around Hasbayya and Rashayya. <br>  <br>  Shiite Muslim <br>  a member of the branch of Islam that regards Ali as the legitimate successor to Mohammed and rejects the first three caliphs. <br>  <br>  Sunni <br>  This is the name for the larger of the two major divisions of Islam.

The Shias are numerically the smaller of the two major branches. According to an estimate in the website IslamForToday.com, about 10 to 15% of the world’s Muslims are Shias. The essential difference between the two branches is on the question of who are the rightful successors of Prophet Mohammad as the spiritual head of the Islamic community. <br>     Following the death of the Prophet, Abu Bakr became the first Caliph and was followed by Umar and then Uthman. After Uthman’s death in 656, Ali, the Prophet’s cousin and son-in-law, became the Caliph. Sunnis recognise all of these as righteous Caliphs. Shias, however, believe that Ali should have been rightfully the first Caliph and was chosen for that role by Mohammad himself and that Abu Bakr was a usurper. They, therefore, do not recognise any of the first three Sunni Caliphs as Caliphs. In fact, the term Shia is from the original Shiat Ali, which in Arabic means Party of Ali or partisans of Ali. <br>     According to the website shia.org, Shias believe that the only people with a divine right to act as Imams (guides) are 12 people from the lineage of Prophet Mohammad: They are Imam Ali; Imam Hasan, son of Ali; Imam Husain, son of Ali; Imam Ali, <br>  son of Husain; Imam Muhammad, son of Ali; Imam Ja’far, son of Muhammad; Imam Musa, son of Ja’- far; Imam Ali, son of Musa; Imam Muhammad, son of Ali; Imam Ali, son of Muhammad; Imam Hasan, son of Ali; and Imam Muhammad, son of Hasan. Shias believe that the last of these Imams is still living, but in occultation. <br>  <br>  Q:What’re the major Shia sects? <br>  <br>  A: The most dominant Shia sect is the Ithna Ashariya (also known as the Twelvers because they acknowledge the 12 Imams). There are also the Ismailis, a sect that, according to Merriam-Websters Encyclopaedia, came into being after the death of the sixth Imam, Jafar. A minority of Shias at that point of time accepted Jafar’s eldest son Ismail as his successor. The third major group are the Zayids or Zaidis. They are also known as the Fivers, since they do not acknowledge the last eight of the 12 Imams. <br>  <br>  Q: In which countries are Shias in a majority? <br>  <br>  A: Iran is overwhelmingly Shia. Azerbaijan and Yemen are two countries in which the Shias form a majority of the population. In Iraq, they constitute 40%. <br>  Q: Are there many Shias in India? <br>  A: They are sizable though a minority of Muslims in India. According to the Penguin Dictionary, there are over 50 million Shias in India. All three major sects, Isna Ashari, Zaidi and Ismaili, exist in India. <br>  <br>  Q: What is the significance of Karbala to the Shias? <br>  <br>  A: Karbala in Iraq is the place where Imam Ali’s son Husain was martyred while fighting Yazid, who had been appointed by his father Muawiya to succeed him as the Caliph. The Shias mark this martyrdom with Muharram.|`|8bb5034ba304f878c28d08b497ed978caa	as long as somethings fighting for good why try to seperate it . get in where you fit in .|`|AA10026403	besides the heafty information everyone else will provide you.

ceb16f840e65f504a04160992a9e8736aa	Some people can trace their lineage back to a specific area of africa (not most american black people can for obvious reasons).  <br>  <br>  Most people don't really consider that as being of different races though.|`|JYXDj402aa	no, differint cultures/herritage/nationality. not race. <br>  <br>  just liek all whit e people are the same race.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	oh, that is not a racist question at all actually.  ok so here is the thing.  lots of people like to say that all people who are black do not necesarily have ancestry in africa but they do.  the reason there are people who are black heavily populating the caribbean is because of the slave trade.  they cannot trace back their ancestry to all of the different african countries because the slave trade totally screwed their ability to trace back their heritage up. and also the boundries did not exist in the country before the slave trade, so they developed after many africans had been exported.  its actually really sad for people of black ancestry and their inability to trace their heritage because everyone has a right to have knowlege about themselves|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Yes, there are three races of Black People.<br>  <br>  The Capoids, the West Africoids (The correct terminology is censored on this site) and the Khoisians. The "West Africoids" are the people native to West and Central Africa. Since most slaves were taken from this region, most African Americans would be considered "West Africoid". The Capoids are the people native to the eastern and southern parts of Africa. The Khosians are a race of people located in southern Africa.<br>  <br>  Almost ALL of the slaves taken to the America's were from West and Central Africa.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	hmmmm.... Asians and Europeans, specific origins ... AFRICA.<br>  <br>  In paleoanthropology, the recent African origin of modern humans is one of two hypotheses of the origin of anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens. The theory is known popularly as the (Recent) Out-of-Africa model, and academically also as the recent single-origin hypothesis (RSOH), Replacement Hypothesis or Recent African Origin (RAO) model. According to the theory, anatomically modern humans evolved solely in Africa, between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, with members of one branch leaving Africa by 60,000 years ago and replacing all earlier human populations such as Neanderthals and Homo erectus. The hypothesis originated in the 1980s based on a study of present day mitochondrial DNA, and its proponents have since presented evidence based on physical anthropology of archaic specimens.<br>  <br>  The recent single origin of modern humans in East Africa is currently the near mainstream position held within the scientific community.<br>  <br>  Alternative scenarios claim a multiregional origin of modern humans, including claims of interbreeding of Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals or other earlier hominids (e.g. Homo erectus, see Hybrid-origin). Some of these claims push back the original "out of Africa" migration to 2 million years ago.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_Afri...</a>|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Different cultures yes.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	They can be traced to the West Indies<br>  but I'm guessing that goes back to Africa<br>  I didnt quiet understand your question but if a person is half indian and half black then they can be traced to both africa and asia and if they're black and white then they can be traced to europe and africa , but theres always some africa in there.<br>  But if you mean to ask the question can African American people come from any other continent besides Africa <br>  then no , and thats why they are called African.<br>  And dont pull Egyptians into this because they're not considered African , they just live on North Africa , but most have light skin and are considered middle easterner.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	There are different tribes in Africa with different genetic make-ups. With a DNA test, you may be able to tell where in Africa you come from. People's DNA changes due to their environment. Africa's environment is not consistent throughout the continent.

As a result of slavery, many of african americans' ancestors were stripped of their national identity and due to lake of technology at the time and the inability to poor people (white or black) to have the resources to record such things it is almost impossible if not completely impossible for many african americans to trace their ancestry back to specific countries in africa.|`|oBesPS6Uaa	STOP<br>  <br>  The proper social/historical definition for African American ancestry group refers to the descendents of Americans slaves and free American blacks who trace their history, heritage, and culture to the United States.

Its common for black immigrants to refer to themselves by their national origin.

CSysSbnlaa	Vampires are real. I'm a Vampire. We don't bite, though. Your either born a Vamp or have to be Changed. If you were born a Vamp you have to be Awakened. To be Awakened is when you realize your a Vamp. If your Human, then you have to be Changed by a real Vamp or do a Witch spell. To get changed by a Vamp, you need to drink their blood, not recommended, you have no idea where that bloods been. To do a Witch spell is easy. You can email me for the spell. Good luck!<br>  ~Midnightrose|`|mjQhyQktaa	I wish Lord Bearclaw of Gryphon Woods would go jump. Honestly. It's getting boring (I'm your downratey stalker, if you're reading this).<br>  Vampires are popular atm. Are you a Twilighter or something? Ugh.<br>  I mean, it'd be awesome to be a vampire, but whatever. If I was a Twilight vamp, I'd kill myself. Well, maybe not, but whatever.<br>  Anyway, re "real" vamps. It's not like there are many, or that biting transfers vampirism (that would mean that everyone in the world'd be a vampire by now). And if they are real, why would one bite you? Humans aren't exactly the best species ever. (No offense, guys, but I hate humans. Sorry!)<br>  So, basically, I hope they're real, they're probably not.<br>  I'm excluding sanguinarians/energy vamps, they're just humans with energy deficiencies.<br>  Also, what type of vampire? Traits? Just wondering if we're even on the same page here.|`|6q2Uyb1Baa	Real vampires are very different from what most people think of when they think of vampires.  We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.  <br>  www.sanguinarius.org<br>  www.slad.net<br>  www.vampirecommunity.com|`|FB596WDCaa	Absolutely.  My ex-wife's lawyer is one.|`|thmLcDVKaa	no,. this question always comes up here.|`|AGpKSCxiaa	no|`|0qG9y7t1aa	I agree with Lord Bearclaw. Why waste your time pretending to be a vampire?

It's far too dangerous, and leaves the donor open to all sorts of infections. And being bitten won't make you a vampire anyway.|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|anfhcnWeaa	if you think vampires are real do your research, don't expect to get an answer from YA! you won't get the answer your hoping for and you'll get a butt load of people telling you vampires don't exist and that anyone who claims to be one is loony. also i am not saying they do not exist because the truth is they do but there is no way to be changed into a vampire you are either born a vamp or your not, and if some one who claims to be a vamp who tells you they will bite you for a price is full of crap they are not vamps at all so don't fall for their scams. <br>   now the people who are born vamps don't know they are till they awaken the awakening is the term for becoming aware of being a vampire. the process of awakening starts between the ages of 17-24 years old.|`|DIxbib1paa	They are not real but count dracula was from Transylvania, he liked the taste of blood and didnt like the smell of garlic, i cant expand on the matter but its something along them lines.|`|y3jD0DDpaa	lord bearclaw has it right im sorry but the only people who mark him down are saddows who want to beleive vampires are real...

There, judgment will be passed upon each individual. Some will be rewarded with heavenly bliss, and others will be condemned to eternal torment. However, the Bible paints quite a different picture of this period of time. God’s Word portrays it, not as a terrifying time, but as a time of hope and restoration.<br>  <br>  Jehovah God is the ultimate Judge of mankind. However, he delegates the actual work of judging. According to Acts 17:31, the apostle Paul said that God “has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed.” This appointed Judge is the resurrected Jesus Christ. (John 5:22) When, though, does Judgment Day begin? How long does it last?<br>  <br>  The book of Revelation shows that Judgment Day begins after the war of Armageddon, when Satan’s system on earth will be destroyed. (Revelation 16:14,?16; 19:19–20:3) After Armageddon, Satan and his demons will be imprisoned in an abyss for a thousand years.  Judgment Day is not some hurried event lasting a mere 24 hours. It lasts a thousand years.  During that thousand-year period, Jesus Christ will “judge the living and the dead.” (2?Timothy 4:1) “The living” will be the “great crowd” that survives Armageddon. <br>  <br>  But on what basis will all be judged?<br>  <br>  According to the apostle John’s vision, “scrolls were opened,” and “the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.” Are these scrolls the record of people’s past deeds? No, the judgment will not focus on what people did before they died. How do we know that? The Bible says: “He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.” (Romans 6:7) Those resurrected thus come to life with a clean slate, so to speak. The scrolls must therefore represent God’s further requirements. To live forever, both Armageddon survivors and resurrected ones will have to obey God’s commandments, including whatever new requirements Jehovah might reveal during the thousand years. Thus, individuals will be judged on the basis of what they do during Judgment Day.<br>  <br>  Judgment Day will give billions of people their first opportunity to learn about God’s will and to conform to it. This means that a large-scale educational work will take place. Indeed, “righteousness is what the inhabitants of the productive land will certainly learn.” (Isaiah 26:9) However, not all will be willing to conform to God’s will.  These wicked ones will be put to death permanently during Judgment Day.<br>  <br>  By the end of Judgment Day, surviving humans will have “come to life” fully as perfect humans.  Judgment Day will thus see the restoration of mankind to its original perfect state.  Then a final test will take place. Satan will be released from his imprisonment and allowed to try to mislead mankind one last time.  Those who resist him will enjoy the complete fulfillment of the Bible’s promise: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” (Psalm 37:29) Yes, Judgment Day will be a blessing to all faithful mankind!|`|AA11413851	Judgemet Day is the end of the world, basically!

During that period Satan and All his demons will be locked up so as not to have any influence over humans during this period. At the end of the 1000 years Satan and his demons will be let loose for a little while and they will tempt the human race again, but with little sucess. Those that disobey will then be destroyed along with Satan and his demons-this is the second death mentioned at Revelation 20;7. This will take place here on earth-but in the end heaven and earth will be united to form God's kingdom-Revelation 21;1-27. God views 1000 human years as one day to him, hence judgement day....KECK

The myth of Pandora is very old, appears in several distinct versions, and has been interpreted in many ways. In all literary versions, however, the myth is a kind of theodicy, addressing the question of why there is evil in the world.: Hesiod, both in his Theogony (briefly, without naming Pandora outright, line 570) and in Works and Days, ca. 700 BC, has a very early told and literary version of the Pandora story.

AA10897347	There are very few cases when hearing voices is not delusional.<br>  Saints, for example, including prophets, were so spiritualized that they could hear God. There are still some saints nowadays, but very few.<br>  For other people, hearing God happens very rarely, usually around the time of their conversion. They don't hear this voice a lot of times, but it's a sort of a one time thing, that points them toward true faith. And from there, they become normal Christians living in the Church.<br>  Hearing voices can also be a trick of the demons, who want to delude Christians into having a high opinion of themselves or even, as time passes, to instill some false truths into their mind.<br>  <br>  Something about spiritual deception in this article (someplace around the middle):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/frseraphim_charismatics.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/fr...</a>|`|0f6e689ca163b3e9e96f10ab64bf3abcaa	When u hear voices|`|223c35364e843915ff8547458e351277aa	When a man wanted to sell his house, he did not go through agent.

2f170fed7b99a4e91335fc9023a803caaa	Fascism is rearing its ugly head again in the world.  Please read Wikipedia's entry for fascism and how it relates politically to events occurring today. It's important to know about that. Very. But, political agendas that use fascism are only part of the problem today.  Today's wave of instability in the social contract is also related to a global economy and a world of people and cultures and tribes and nations and notions no longer separated by distances. With modern communications, television, the Internet, air travel and intercontinental missiles, we are all bumping into each other and there's no new frontier to escape to. We are bumping into each others languages and spiritual beliefs and customs and notions. There's bound to be instability and confusion as the world makes this adjustment. The real offense to the dignity of humanity, though, is not so much the pathetic hatred and ignorance and confusion and even bigotry of average people. It's the morbid political agendas of greed and plunder and deliberate attempts to put asunder the social contract, agendas including fascism and propaganda. That is the BEAST. Read more about this.  What is happening today will so destroy YOUR age-group's future that you will never know the same freedoms and quality of life that proceeding generations have enjoyed if you go along with it blindly.<br>  <br>  Here is Wikipedia's entry for fascism. Note especially Prof. Paxton's inclusion.

In English, you would be referring to a skullcap.<br>  <br>  Jewish men wear these as a sign of respect for their version of a a supreme being.  It's also worn because men are required to cover their heads when in prayer, and in judaism, one can pray at any time and just about any place.<br>  <br>  Married jewish women cover their heads to signify both their marital status and their fidelity<br>  <br>  Then again, traditionally, christian women cover their heads when in a church, and in many religions, men routinely cover their heads at least when they pray.|`|AA11929231	To show their respect before THE GOD.<br>  <br>  They keep their head covered.|`|53508c26f5cd4045c5bf39c8169c3ffcaa	to make you ask questions. <br>  Works pretty good HUH?<br>  (my uncle is jewish and that was HIS  answer to my 6 year old coz asking the same  question)|`|8c6862a271d7f95609a6595669ffda82aa	no|`|d4e173ca2aeaa15a3cdcfd9288ac3f68aa	The story of the origin of the yarmulke, pronounced yamaka, comes from the Talmud, Shabbos 156b.<br>  <br>  It happened that there was a Jewish woman <br>  who was getting ready to have a baby during the Mishnaic times. (Around the times of Jesus.)<br>  Roman astrologers ran up to her and told her that the baby would be a thief. The woman went to the Sages and asked them what to do, and they said, "Cover his head so that the fear of heaven will rest on him."<br>  <br>  She did, and the baby grew up to be a leader of the Jewish people, Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak. The Jewish people, seeing that it worked, took on the custom of covering the head of boys so that they would fear G-d. (The word yarmulke is an acronym for Fear the Kingship of G-d.)<br>  <br>  In Judaism it is believed that prophecy was taken out of the world after the prophet Malachai, but that a vestige of it exists with Jews who keep the Sabbath collectively. What that meens in practical terms is that if all the Jews who keep the Sabbath start doing something, it becomes legally binding on the Jewish people like a decree from the Prophets. This is one of those things.<br>  <br>  What about little girls? Little girls can't cover their head because in the Bible, in the section in numbers about the Woman who's husband is jealous and fears she committed adultary, when he takes her to the temple for the test to be administered, one of the things the Priest does is uncover her hair.<br>  <br>  Jewish tradition learns from this that a married woman or a woman who has had relations with a man must cover her hair.<br>  <br>  SIngle girls can't cover their heads because it would imply they are promiscuous. The Magen Avraham, a famous Rabbi, suggests that instead of covering their head, they should braid their hair tightly, and it will have the same effect. This is the custom among traditional Jerusalemite families, and many Hungarians.

The Lord Jesu Christ told Hia 12 apostles that He was going to be killed and rise again but they understood nothing He said. Luke 18: 31 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.

I assked him what was wrong but he didn't reply, so i called an ambulance straight away. He was in hosoital unconsious and had to be put on life support, he had meningitis. If i wasn't there he might not be here. I was going to go shopping with my mum and sister but my intuition told me not to.

AA10181777	Who else? You even quoted a verse to support this. Your question is actually one of the following: (a) WHY does God create all the evil and disasters in the world, or (b) Does God EXIST such that He would create all the evil and disasters in the world. Once you accept God's existence, He has to be responsible for all the evil and disasters - otherwise He would not be God.<br>  The first question is the harder one; see the Book of Job - at the end, his "answer" seems to be just the Majesty of God. Some explain this that God is so, for lack of a better term, brilliant/genius, that He has a grand plan for the world that will end up with the best for everyone, and mere mortals usually cannot understand how this specific "bad" effect is actually good. One example that some noticed: On September 11, 2001, a number of people (not just one) left something very important at home or missed the plane. Naturally, they were quite distressed - until they heard what happened to the plane. Other people were laid off on September 10. Their place of work - the World Trade Center.<br>  As for the second question: Maybe, according to some, you could say that the creation of life and all the "coincidences"/Murphy's Law/miracles are just random acts of chance and we just "happen" to live on a world where the quantum particles interact in this manner, but the chances that life formed is greater than an ant walking around a piece of paper with ink on its feet and writing a dictionary. Frankly, if this were a horse race, I wouldn't bet on those odds. Plus, if you have faith, you believe in God.|`|23c33d933cf10ad465c4da514031c508aa	try reading Job....|`|8BBvzs9Jaa	Believe God, he is a good God. He wants to bless you. He wants to give you the best. All the diasters and evil that you may read in the papers are all the works of devil. However, sometimes God let it happens. He let it happen is not because he wants to punish you. But what comes after the diaster is something far much better than before. Sometimes is to train a person, a nation or to bring up a nation. <br>  <br>  My pastor once said this, the devil will look signs and hints of what God is doing and tried to destroy his plan. However he will never knows what God is trying to do. God of course knows what the devil is up to and planned his involvement to achieve something better. Therefore, to know what God is doing, just look at what the devil is doing and think of the opposite. Then you will be able to understand the good intention of God. <br>  <br>  I shared the same sentiment for all the evils and diaster on earth. However, I trust more in God and his way. <br>  <br>  In Isiah, the evil mentioned in there is not the evil of sin. (God is not the author of that) but the evil of punishment.|`|b607b1db41b4adaa4648d581e7c17da5aa	Lemme guess- "no, that's the devil"|`|66f7d16654ff94ccefd47a36ca5c5efaaa	Yes he does! <br>  <br>  This proves that he is sovereign and in complete control of everything.

When that odd guy walks pat you and the hair on the back of your neck stands up or the dog consistently barks at that one strange lady that sells bibles door to door.  It is a feeling of something not quite right with you, I just can't put my finger on it until I get to know you a little better. Then, run like the wind!|`|490e5641a5761909b8eeceed31a548ecaa	well its the softer whisper in your ears and you easily ignore it|`|e3b5fb4c3b0b1f53173bf382245aab25aa	Many times your first feelings are correct.When I need to make a decision I ask myself the following:<br>  1.Have you prayed about it? Prayer was never intended to be a fourth-down punting situation in which we ask God to bail us out of our hasty decisions. It was intended to be a first-down huddle. We aren't supposed to ask God to bless our plans; we're supposed to ask God for His plans. <br>  2.Is it consistent with the Word of God? In our culture, ignorance of God's Word is no excuse since resources abound. I believe that every home should have at least a concordance, a Bible dictionary, a topical Bible, a good commentary, and a study Bible with notes. Most pastors would love to share what God has to say about a given matter. If they wouldn't, you have called the wrong pastor! <br>  3.Can I do it and be a positive Christian witness? A seminary student stopped by my office and told me about a job he had been offered. It would take care of his financial needs, but he had some reservations concerning the sales pitch he was required to use. I asked him if he could use the sales technique and be a positive witness for Christ. He didn't take the job.<br>  4. Will the Lord be glorified? Can I do this and give glory to God? In doing it, would I be glorifying God in my body? Am I seeking the glory of man or the glory of God? Am I doing this to be noticed by man or am I seeking to please the Lord? <br>  5.Am I acting responsibly? God doesn't bail us out of our irresponsibility. But when we are faithful in little things, He will put us in charge of greater things. Don't get ahead of God's timing or you will be over your head in responsibilities. Seek to develop your life and message, and God will expand your ministry.<br>  <br>  This helps me. I hope it helps you. Good luck.|`|3f2cb2c7b16a25969c81fa7c08a3214baa	You gotta believe in yourself to just know...Go with it!!|`|4798eafe385a2dd3a58c247394a4ab81aa	It is not a thought it is adrenalin, it is thought that triggers the adrenalin gland, and  that becomes a gut feeling or hunch.|`|a7b5fe516bba426ffbcc23e1640c8556aa	That is hard to explain, Mr Data.|`|AA11621783	I think a gut feeling/hunch sticks with you.

These days we can eat the food of Jewish people but not Christians because most Christians eat pork which is forbidden for Muslims. Jew also dont eat pork so it makes it easier. It does not refer to vegetables. Jewish slaughter of meat is somewhat similiar to the Muslims.. What is kosher to Jews is halal to Muslims. Therefore if a Muslim does not have halal food available, they can eat kosher food. However, the Christians dont normally used the kosher way. Since I myself adhere to the rule of halal meat if I am eating Mc Donalds, Burger King or KFC, I would not eat the meat, only vegetables. Seafood however is exempted. We can eat seafood anywhere. We are also asked to take precautions about any food mixed with pork or other meat. Like marshmellows they have pork gelatine. That is a no no for me. Twinkies has animal shortenings, something I avoid. But I dont mind eating food from the Kosher section. The rule of eating halal does say that if you dont have any choice you could eat the meat but no pork.

a763cb1d1c1e24d6690f01f3355254d1aa	The Islamic religion encourages its followers to take shower every day if possible. However Islam is also a practical religion and it has never been a teaching in Islam to ask its follower to take showers every time after using the restroom.<br>  <br>  In Islam there are at least three (3) main types of taking showers, namely:<br>  (1) Optional shower;<br>  (2) Encouraged shower;<br>  (3) Obligatory shower.<br>  <br>  Optional shower:<br>  <br>  Optional shower is the ordinary shower we take. We can take shower as many as we like based on convenience. Muslims in South East Asia normally take shower twice a day; one in the morning before going to school / work and another in the evening.<br>  <br>  Encouraged shower:<br>  <br>  There are many situations that Muslims are encouraged to take shower. For example: Muslims are encouraged to take shower before going for Friday Prayer. The basic rational is to avoid any unpleasant smell (body odor) when praying with other people in a mosque.<br>  <br>  Obligatory shower:<br>  <br>  This is a must-to-do shower. Muslims must take shower in certain circumstances.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  It is a religious obligation to take a shower after husband and wife finished having intercourse.<br>  It is also a religious obligation for Muslim women to take shower after their menstrual periods.<br>  <br>  In short:<br>  Muslims are encouraged to take showers every day but not to the extent of taking showers  every time after using the restroom.|`|4292023207258dd5028fb2a277c98356aa	No, Muslim don't shower after they use the rest room, they just wash there anus with water.

AA11984278	Seem like you got a pretty good system going already.  I would recommend that you seek the Lord's guidance and He will direct your path.  I'm a witness because He done  it for me!<br>  <br>  You may not believe this but back in during the early "1990's" I prayed to the LORD about reading the Bible from cover to cover and went on a three day fast to seek his instruction.  After I'd  came out of my fast I started my journey and read a few books daily.  The project started on March 1st and was completed on March 15th of that same month.  <br>  <br>  I considered it a miracle because that was the first time I'd ever read the Bible from cover to cover and finished it in (15) days! <br>  It was so exciting, and adventurous and it seemed like I was in a movie because the pages seemed to come to life.  I couldn't wait each day to continue where I'd left off from reading.  It was truly incredible.  I took notes, and related back to what I read to discern the preached Word over the pulpit, and Sunday School class assignments, etc.  <br>  <br>  Peace,<br>  <br>  Hope

a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I grew up with a faith different from my parents.  They started to practice Christianity when I was around 11 years old, but by then I had already formed my own neo-pagan beliefs and practices.  Since they felt that they were commanded to convert me, we had many issues.  But once I left home, they felt that their job of raising me was finished and they respected my beliefs.  I am now in my forties and am still neo-pagan and my parents are still Christian.  We respect each others beliefs and even encourage each other to follow the path that is right for us.<br>  <br>  Generally (especially in countries without exposure to various religions) a person will follow the religion that they were raised in (if any).  For example, the concepts of Catholicism would be very foreign ideas to a Hindu that was raised in rural India---in the same way that Hindu beliefs would be quite odd to someone who has only been exposed to Christianity.  Our religions are entertwined with our cultures and the history of our individual cultures.  That Hindu would have a different outlook towards life and their role in it, and they would believe just as strongly in their beliefs as anyone else.<br>  <br>  World religion is a very interesting subject and if you have the chance to take a course in it--or even pick up a dictionary of world religions at the library--you may find it fascinating.  It helps to understand people from their point of view rather than from our own.

However allow me to explain, assuming that such a term exists.<br>  <br>  I do not have to discuss the meaning of the word atheist. I assume you know what the word means. Now, what is "fundamentalist"? Fundamentalist is a word composed of a main part and two suffixes (fundamen + al + ist).<br>  <br>  Fundament: 1. an underlying ground,  theory or principal. 2. buttock, anus, part of the land tha has not been altered by human activities.<br>  <br>  Fundamental: adding the "al" suffix change the word into an "adjective".<br>  <br>  Fundamentalist: adding the "ist" change the word into a "noun", meaning someone who adheres to the underlying ground, principal, theory regarding a specific thing. Fundamentalism is a movement, dogma, belief.<br>  <br>  There is a wide misconception about the word "fundamentalist". People normally make it synonymous to rigidity, narrow-mindedness and restricted-thinking; all negative words which might not be the actual case. Personally I do not find anything wrong with being fundamental. One can be fundamintalist along with being a free-thinker.  the two words may sound contradicting on the surface, but a deep understanding indicates otherwise.<br>  <br>  So your answer can be reached by you, putting  your understanding  and the two words "fundamentalist" and "atheist" all together, regardless such a term exists or not.|`|AA11247030	Someone who must really believe there is no god?<br>  <br>  Wait.... isn't every atheist like that?<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "Fundamentalist Atheist", because there is only one "fundemental" principal to atheism; god does not exist.|`|AA11812186	That's new for me, but sounds very illogical.|`|a6ce596155aa57dea3dda35221bc57c3aa	It means that the "fundy" is too closed-minded to even think about the concept of a higher being.<br>  Fundamentalists of any sort will not change their mind about their fundamental belief. To me, that just seems ignorant.<br>  I'd say - always keep an open mind.

Honor your father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; That it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.  And you, fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord"  Ephesians: 6:1-4<br>  <br>  "Study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman that need not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."<br>  2 Timothy: 2:15 KJV<br>  <br>  "Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth."  2 Timothy: 2:15 NIV<br>  <br>  "Train up a child in the way that he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."  Proverbs: 22:6 KJV<br>  <br>  "But he said, Leave the children alone! allow them to come to me, and do not forbid or restrain or hinder them, for of such [as these] is the kingdom of heaven composed."  <br>  Matthew: 19:14 AMP<br>  <br>  "A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in his time."

And just so every thing is straight, I would like to explain where that statement originates from. Thomas Jefferson wrote several  letters, one of which was called: "A letter from my head to my heart" in that letter he used the phrase, "Separation of Church and state", the reason that Thomas Jefferson wrote these letters was because he was in love with a women who was married, but he couldn't stop himself from falling in love with her, and thus he wrote those letters, to him self, in order to convince him self to not do something very foolish.|`|dc43db5e92751847442461def2bd0d26aa	what are you talking about?

AA10251718	In the beginning was the word. This translates to logos which means the Thought of God which emanates from God but is not God. <br>  <br>  The only way we can know God is through His Spirit contacting us. In order for that Spirit to contact us, from time to time there is a person born with what we call the Holy-Spirit. This Holy Spirit is able to receive the logos-the logos is the thought of God. This person who has the Holy Spirit expresses God's thoughts in words, in a Revelation.<br>  <br>  We can't know God in His essence—only through His logos or thought—the Revelation of God. The logos descended upon Moses in the burning bush. The spirit of God descended upon Jesus as a dove when He was baptized by John in the river Jordan. The logos descended upon Muhammad in the cave of Hira. The same happened with the Bab and Baha'u'llah. These are the Great Divine Manifestations. And the only thing we can ever know of God comes from the Manifestations.|`|948df6b28864c8fd96464f423b8731bfaa	the logos is a greek word for( The written word of God.)|`|c7da0c8f1c2be61f59895b51f5f80ce8aa	It's Greek for the Word.<br>  <br>  G3056<br>  λο?γο?<br>  logos<br>  log'-os<br>  From G3004; something said (including the thought); by implication a topic (subject of discourse), also reasoning (the mental faculty) or motive; by extension a computation; specifically (with the article in John) the Divine Expression (that is, Christ): - account, cause, communication, X concerning, doctrine, fame, X have to do, intent, matter, mouth, preaching, question, reason, + reckon, remove, say (-ing), shew, X speaker, speech, talk, thing, + none of these things move me, tidings, treatise, utterance, word, work.<br>  <br>  God is eternal having neither beginning of days or end of life, a Spirit fire or light called life. The Word begins with thought from conscious awareness I am, acquiring wisdom to reason thought to self with the Word. The Word was with God and the Word was God. This wisdom of thought with words is not any substance or matter but Spirit, the Holy Spirit. God is One, by Himself or alone with His Words the Holy Spirit. This timeless existence of reasoning wanted company and God’s thoughts turn to creating company or sons. Sons to behold, abide with, and communion with. God discovered love, not of the thought, but of the sons He envisioned. God felt this love, the magnificence of it and wanted His sons to love Him. God realized He could not create true love or forced it upon a being, but true love would only manifest in sons of freewill. The wisdom of God also knew it would be necessary to govern sons of freewill by laws that are fair and righteous, to hold them accountable. God was willing to risk rejection and rebellion against the law. Sons of freewill could choose not to love Him but must obey the law. The sons would need a place to abide, explore, and grow. God created the heavens and the earth, His kingdom.<br>  <br>  Then, God the Father created all souls with intellect within a spirit body and with freewill. The law/s of this kingdom is unknown, but God is King and this was His dominion. One of God’s sons with freewill named Satan rebelled against God and the law. One third of God’s children followed Satan. God sentenced Satan to perish. The soul that sins shall die. Satan accused his followers of his same sin. Satan has the power or legal right, to accuse one third of the sons of God. God loved His children and could not destroy the one third. Instead, God destroyed that earth age. The earth became waste and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.<br>  <br>  The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Now in this earth age, sons of freewill placed in flesh bodies, are born innocents through the womb. With no knowledge of events of the rebellion are free to choose to follow God or Satan, a choice of eternal life or eternal death.   <br>  <br>  Satan and his close followers continued to rebel. God allows Satan and his followers some headway. Using this as the negative part of His plan, this is ultimately positive.<br>  <br>  God’s plan forasmuch then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood. He also Himself in the Son Jesus Christ likewise took part of the same. That through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil or Satan. Delivering them whom through fear of death was all their lifetime subject to bondage. Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son and the express image of God’s person, God with us, became legal inheritor of the kingdom. Paid the price for sin, for the life of the flesh is in the blood. God has given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls. For it is the blood, that makes atonement for the soul. God made Christ to have dominion over the works of His hands and has put all things under Christ’s feet.|`|AA10260693	The name (or, perhaps, title) “the Word” (Joh 1:1) apparently identifies the function that God’s firstborn Son performed after other intelligent creatures were formed. A similar expression is found at Exodus 4:16, where Jehovah says to Moses concerning his brother Aaron: “And he must speak for you to the people; and it must occur that he will serve as a mouth to you, and you will serve as God to him.” As spokesman for God’s chief representative on earth, Aaron served as “a mouth” for Moses. Likewise with the Word, or Logos, who became Jesus Christ. Jehovah evidently used his Son to convey information and instructions to others of his family of spirit sons, even as he used that Son to deliver his message to humans on earth. Showing that he was God’s Word, or Spokesman, Jesus said to his Jewish listeners: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me. If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality.”|`|4e1b2eaf97f033fd20db1a0fa3c6abbbaa	Anywhere you see the word "word" in the Scriptures, the Greek underlying it is "logos." It literally means word, speech, utterance, meaning, etc. It had overtones from its use in Stoic philosophy, where it indicated the principle giving order and structure to the cosmos. <br>  <br>  The Johannine writings identify Jesus as the incarnate Logos of God.

In fact, the first decision you have is to take the first breath or not to take the first breath. If not good bye Charley. The role of Satan comes in to test us on our belief in God, to make sure that we do not stray. Plus Satan was cast out from God, but just like a Human repentance works on angels as well. God loves everything that He creates. Just like a father would never (if he is a good father) abandon his son when the son rebels and gets himself into trouble. The why should God turn his back towards Satan. There is this hope that Satan will to repent. There is no such thing as a bad person, there are only people who made wrong choices.

AA10022437	Hi!, here's what Bnei Baruch (a non lucrative organization that is dedicated to spread the wisdom of Authentic Kabbalah) have to say about kabbalah's new popularity, "it is written in The Book of Zohar, that  at  the end of the twentieth century humanity will start  asking about the meaning of life, and that the answer to this question, hidden in  the  ancient  science of Kabbalah, can only be revealed in our time, precisely because of these challenging circumstances.<br>  <br>  The science of Kabbalah has been concealed over millennia for this very reason. People were not ready for it, and did not need it. But in recent years its appeal has risen dramatically. Many have taken up Kabbalah studies, curious as to what it can give them. Once a person realizes that Kabbalah answers the question about the meaning of life, he or she no longer feels intimidated by it, and begins to actively engage in studying it.<br>  <br>  Ideas that Kabbalah is about magic, miracles, red strings, and holy water are gradually dying out. People can see that these are merely psychological phenomena.<br>  <br>  The demand for true, authentic Kabbalah is growing. In other words, there is a growing demand for that which will allow us to sense the greater universe, eternal existence, and the higher governing forces. People want to know why our world and our lives are unfolding as they are, where we came from and where we are headed.<br>  <br>  In our times, many people from around the world have developed an interest in that question, and this is why the science of Kabbalah is gaining widespread popularity. As this earthly existence seems all the more dissatisfying and limiting, more and more people seek to associate themselves with something beyond this world.<br>  <br>  Thus, today people are ready for the science of Kabbalah. It welcomes all those who truly seek to discover the meaning of life, the source of our existence, and offers a practical method of attaining it."<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more about Kabbalah, visit Bnei Barcuch's site at: www.kabbalah.info, or send me an email I will be glad to answer any question you have (my mail: bbjuanjo@yahoo.com). I study Kabbalah at Bnei Baruch|`|f9d348d2a0331e6d260ac81abc7c24a2aa	Depends on which one you get caught up in. I have seen some paganism things thrown into the mix and cvalled Kabbalah. The one taught by Berg (who Madonna follows) does somethings which in Jewish law make no sense at all. Biggest one being, having non Jews do Jewish rituals. Those laws aren't meant for non Jews.|`|8f1f86b132a30996692387313df426f3aa	Traditional kabbalism is based in Orthodox Judaism, thousands of years of tradition and writings, coupled with a mathamatical system applied to the scriptures in order to gain secrets or revelations.<br>  <br>  The new Kabbalah is a bunch of bullshit for celebrities and wealthy Californians, who have a spiritual vaccuum they want to fill.  But of course it has to be something trendy and original because Christianity and Islam are too stale and have negative connotations, in the view of cool people like Californians.  So they make up bullshit religions like Scientology and new Kabbalah which has rituals and purifications to make the believer feel good, while negating the aspects of other religions that condemn misbehavior and sin.  Therefore, the celebrity can still do whatever the hell they want, without feeling guilty, but can partially fill their spiritual vaccuum with ridiculous rituals.

5e1149257e927cd2ec8f3ef8b006f753aa	You are beginning to discover your identity and explore your ethnic orgins. You are curious about your roots. There is no wrong in that--if anything, this is only good. It broadens your intellectual spectrums and makes you more accepting of others.|`|76255ecc584cd1006f1116e750d7ba6eaa	No,it's not wrong to feel like that,in fact,it's perfectly natural that you would be curious about your own heritage.

Good luck!|`|f4fb7d65e0dfd5898923f7623ab4284baa	It's perfectly normal. All I can say is that the only people that matter are your parents who have loved you and cared for you. Don't put too much emphasis on what others think or how they perceive you. It is of no consequence in your life- but if you let your mind make it more important than it is, you will create issues with the family that loved you! Be strong and stay focused!

But let's go on anyway.<br>  <br>  "I prayed One time to LEARN how to pray."<br>  If you prayed, then you already knew how to do it.

Does God hate them?<br>  <br>  "but there are those things that cannot be explained."<br>  Right. You just insert *GOD* when that happens, and POOF, there's your explanation. Sorry, skippy... that's not the way a rational mind works.
tsA5b2yzaa	Yes. Years back when someone admitted to being gay, it was shocking, and most likely it got them beat up. Being gay is becoming more and more acceptable, and I do think it has a lot to do with more people coming out about it. Seriously, if you look just a few years back compared to today then you will see a major difference, and I doubt the progression is going to slow down. Eventually, being gay will be accepted worldwide.|`|Dl7xtjH9aa	No, if they all came out at once it would freak people out. they'd be surprised at the number and those who see homosexuality as a threat will see it as more of a threat.

People will mistreat each other, and children won't respect their parents, and the leaders of the Jewish people will be corrupt.<br>  <br>  Then this leader will come who will be over 80 yrs old and teach the Jews to repent. ELijah the prophet will appear and reinstate the Sanhedrin, and they will declare the 80+ yr. old man the King of the Jews.  He's the Messiah.<br>  <br>  The hearts of most of humanity will change and people will become naturally good. SOme people will be so wicked that they remain wicked.

T4jm1U95aa	Jean - you post lots of questions worrying about what people think of you and your tattoos.  Sounds like you should not have gotten the tattoo you got.  Look into tattoo removal. or a good cover up job of it.<br>  <br>  I love tattoos...but you should think LONG and HARD about a tattoo before getting one<br>  <br>  It is your own fault if <br>  A) you put something permenant on your body that you now dislike, it shows you did it without thinking about it and each time you post the same question, over and over...it just shows the rest of this community...and yes this answer site is a tattoo community, that you made a bad decision.<br>  or<br>   B) You care WAY to much what other people think...Grow up, be a big girl...if you like your tatts...ignore the ignorant.|`|4bfacf743830a81b96da83d19bf8b779aa	girl your family is crazy...your dad getting drunk and telling everyone about your tats, and now this?  <br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are,  you seem like a nice girl, I think maybe you obsess alittle on what your family thinks about you.  I know family is very important.<br>  <br>  Your family should take your word and respect you unless you have lied and deceived them over and over again.<br>  <br>  All you can do is make your case and leave it at that.  You owe nobody and explanation nor an apology.|`|3e69419f16ea9b496a02d60d82563bdcaa	As long as you know the truth, it should be okay. If your family has it set in their mind that you have had the relations, then so be it. Just tell them truthfully, and if they don't believe it. O well. People have a tendency to believe what they want and that includes "Family".|`|Tz3A02Zzaa	Whether you did or didn't is irrelevant. Your question is how to convince someone that you didn't. The more you say you didn't they more most people will assume the opposite. So just say, <br>  <br>  "Yes I did. But now and then everyone makes of fool of themselves. If you are no better at making love than he is, its a wonder he exists at all."|`|fKwUDb7Iaa	If you've proven to your parents that you can't be trusted (ie, getting tatoos behind their backs), then they'll find it very hard to believe you when you say you didn't do something wrong. Unless they have some real serious problems of their own, however, I believe your parents and family really want to believe you. Give them time and be patient with them as you gain their trust again. May take a while, but it's worth it for your family.

During the summer I took my son to the swimming pool. In the evenings a lot of television shows were watched and we listened to the radio a lot. I remember doing some science experiments at home too. Making a volcano out of playdough and filling it with baking soda and vinegar. What fun!  ( We didnt get a computer until 2000 and didnt even know much about them and didnt even care about having one until it seemed everyone we talked to had one and we felt left behind in the world of technology)........Edit: Lots of people went for sunday drives, went out for ice cream , sat on front porches and  visited with friends or neighbors or prepared baked goods for church potluck dinners. I asked my  older sister (born in 1945) and some had hobbies they did like painting pictures,taking drives in the country, knitting, sewing and going to visit relatives quite often .

AA10744085	Absolutely! We believe each generation has a fixed number of righteous men who go around the world moving in the prophetic, in blessings, cursings, the miraculous.<br>  Remember, G-d said He would never leave us.<br>  As Jews, we believe in what are called Tzadikkim; men of righteousness who live in humility & travel the world teaching by example; not men of fame or recognition, but of a genuine closeness with G-d. These men are specifically for the people of Israel, but will reach out to any person genuinely seeking truth.|`|7109620c4225f326f10bda246dd6079daa	I have a follow up questions for sawyer - must those prophets necessaily be jewish ? and if so why? how can they be prophets to the many many parts of the world  where jews dont live?|`|d4e173ca2aeaa15a3cdcfd9288ac3f68aa	Wow, we get into the fun of people with no possible way of knowing the answer answwering.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Judaism believes prophecy was taken out of the world after the prophet Malachi because G-d desires to maintain man's free will. If he has as obvious a proof of his existence as prophecy in the world, he puts in the world a disproof just as strong so people can chose to do right or wrong. If people knew 100% G-d existed they couldn't chose to do evil for the same reason you can't chose to steal if you know the shopkeaper sees you and has a loaded gun.<br>  <br>   Man came to a point though where the evil counterfit was so strong, that there wouldn't be any believers left, so G_d took it out of the world, and took prophecy too. <br>  <br>  So we don't believe there are any prophets after those mentioned in Tanakh. There were many many more during the times of Tanakh then just the few mentioned, as the Tanakh itself says. This fellow hid some prophets from Ahab, Saul went to Ploni place and met some prophets. They were around.<br>  <br>  The Talmud is 1500 years old about. In its present organization with standardized type face, and page numbers, it is about 300 years old. The Talmud is the most standardized religious text in the world, so that if you take page 9 in the first Tractate in any Talmud, count five letters over, it is the same in every talmud. THis system was developed in the Russian city of Vilna maybe 300 years ago.<br>  <br>  About those other people, we have a tradition that there were only a few prophets among the nations: Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem, Bilaam and Job. Of those, Bilaam had the highest revelation, though he was the most evil. The Talmud says he was the equall in prophecy to Moses.|`|AA11929231	No.<br>  <br>  All who tell of the Prophetic Word are prophets!<br>  <br>  ""could prophets like lord kirhsna of hinduism and the buddha been prophets?""<br>  <br>  NOPE!

9fad2ef913287d4c8f7e5228a8f16bf7aa	bad idea.  If it's true that this guy does in fact have a girlfriend, and he is indeed flirting with you, what does that say about him?  If you were able to "steal" him away, it would only be evidence of how fickle his affections are.  And then, how could you ever feel comfortable?  You'd always be worried that there's other girls who want him, and there probably will be.  It'll only be a matter of time before something else new and exciting captures his attention.  <br>  There's plenty of fish in the sea!  The only thing that can get int he way of finding a quality guy that you deserve is lowering your standards and accepting a guy and a situation such as this. Let it go, conduct yourself with pride, and keep your eyes peeled for better prospects.  They are out there, and you'll be saving yourself a lot of heartache.|`|2RJZys3qaa	You sound young.

How do you know that he won't do the same thing to you? Not to mention how his current gf might react. How would you feel if some tramp was flirting with your man behind your back, and then stole him from you? I don't think you'd be all that happy. Find someone else honey, this one will only lead to hurt feelings.|`|awzl6Ewfaa	I don't think "stealing" him or trying to is a good idea because even though you might get him, it will only wind up making you look bad to others once they find out what happened. Besides, if he really does have a girlfriend and he's flirting with you, who is to say that if you wound up with him, he wouldn't flirt with somebody else when you aren't around? I'd let this one go and wait until a nice guy that was only into me, and nobody else, came along. You'll be much happier in the end.|`|29ef030b104cd08e1d4756f0e42c9decaa	before you do something like this you should ask yourself "If I could so easly get this guy to dump or cheat on his girlfriend for me, what's to stop some other chick from doing the same thing while you are with him"

God will not stop a person from killing themselves.  Suicide is a sin.  God will not stop a person from committing sin.  Each person has the responsibility not to sin.  I am not trying to be cruel or judgmental, for I know that this is a difficult time for you and you are asking yourself many questions, all of which start with Why?.  Whatever God does or whatever he allows he does so that he might receive the greatest amount of glory and the we might receive the greatest amount of good. I cannot see any good in suicide, but then I am not God.  My evaluation of good and evil is very limited because as a human being I am a very limited creation.  She is in God's hands now and what becomes of her soul is up to him.|`|AFkZQi7kaa	yes He really exist. I am very sorry for your loss. The bible does say that suicide is an abomination against God but I am still learning the bible myself. We dont know what went on in your friends mind before she did this to herself.  In my mind if she asked forgiveness then she is saved. I would study the bible and come to my own conclusion. When you begin to seek the truth about God you will begin to see in your everyday life how real He is.|`|b9b0ee4dee3513860da35d94752971f1aa	“Suicide is not chosen; it happens<br>  when pain exceeds <br>  resources for coping with pain.”|`|d9fb1dd645e4f5559a0eee63dd4ba255aa	I know it's shocking to hear such news.  It doesn't mean that God doesn't exist, though.  There are so many cases where people are saved as if by a miracle, so maybe you could reason that he knew best.<br>  <br>  People who commit suicide are usually depressed and have lost all hope.  God doesn't judge people and send them to hell for that, I'm absolutely sure, even though I don't think the Bible directly states what happens to them.<br>  <br>  It's so sweet of you to have prayed for someone you don't even know.  I'm sure God will bless you for your attitude!  :  )|`|fPbv0qvfaa	It's pretty much mum. Touchy subject for me. She chose her own path, her own way.

Some have quoted references to "thou shalt not kill (murder)" but I have not decided for myself if those verses apply to suicide.  <br>  <br>  Yes God exists and He loves us enough to give us all free will (otherwise we'd be robots).  Unfortunately, your friend used her free will and chose to take her own life.  I'm very sorry that your friend chose to do this terrible thing.|`|AA12295759	That's very sad. Yes, God really exists, and He is love. I guess she couldn't take the pain, but God would have helped her if she'dreached out to Him. Your prayers cannot force an issue if the person refuses to open to Him.<br>  <br>  I believe you can still pray for her. If you want me to explain why, e-mail me.

Fanatics of all flavors from atheists through Veerashaivas try to force their beliefs on other with tragic consequences.<br>  <br>  The thought that what is perceived true is true has been used in special interest movements since the 1950's in the US.  "I perceive that you are insulting me therefore you are".  This only works for philosophical or "make believe" situations.  "I perceive that I will die if I shoot myself in the head" with this high powered pistol is irrelevant.  The fact is that it will come to pass whether you perceive it to be true or not.

A aucun moment le nouveau testament ne fait mention d'un quelconque prophète qui viendrai après Jesus. Les musulmans sont obligés de reconna?tre Jesus si ils veulent que leur prophète ait une once de crédibilité, mais les chrétiens n'ont aucune raison de reconna?tre Mohamed.<br>  De nombreuses analyses ont été faites sur de nombreux sites donnant la parole aux croyants de ces deux religions, va t'y faire ton idée.<br>  <br>  <br>  ps : lol sheryo arrête ton prosélytisme stp :) les musulmans ont détourné le mot paraclet (avocat) du texte original pour y trouver periclet (consolateur)...

jdwd3kgJaa	I too am well versed in the reasons why racism exist(and not because I have a sociology degree) I have the experience of the subject that you studied from some books! I remember going to the stores downtown with my parents as a little girl, needing to go to the restroom and the "colored restroom" was occupied, so I chose to use the "white one" I saw the fear on my parents face! Yes I could very well be called a racist!!!! I remember going to the drug store on a hot day and sitting down to have an ice cream cone,of course I was given the cone, but had to stand and eat it, Yes, I could very well be called a racist!!! I remember my mother ironing all night long for mrs. white lady, and the next day her 16 year old daughter would come to pick up her articles, and when I answered the door she would ask for my mother using only her first name, while my mother would say yes mam to this child, Yes, I guess I could be called a racist!! I can remember going to the movies on saturday with my friends, paying the same amount as everybody else, but having to enter the side door and go upstairs to the "Buzzard Roof", I even remember the rides on the back of the bus, and standing if all the seats were taken, so yes I guess I could very well be labeled as a racist!!! One hot summer day, I was thirsty and made the mistake of drinking from the "white" water fountain and then being escorted from the store because I had gotten out of place!! As I sit here, I could go on and on, but don't feel it necessary: I am sure you have gotten at least some understanding as to why I would be a bit racist! It was true for me, children do learn what they live!!!!|`|RG82u6Aeaa	So what if someone is?

If you deny it you are only trying to appease to another race, but behind there backs you aren't afraid to laugh at racial jokes..<br>  Stero types are there for a reason, most likely because that's what people have come to expect from the "Majority" of that race. Some are true while others are exagerated. The biggest misconception of Racism is that if you are racist you are full of hate for that race, that's not true at all..<br>  <br>  Now about the last comment that you left on my question, calling me unintelligent. Sweetie you don't have any idea how smart or dumb I am, it's only stupid to assume  you know. A great scholar once said "A wise man knows that he knows nothing", So you can have a degree in anything you want it doesn't mean that you have common sense or intelligence in every matter that comes to hand. When you get a little older and grow wiser, you will begin to understand this. Don't feel sorry for my kids, they are extremely smart. My 14 year old has aspirations to be a politician someday and can debate politics with adults and win.. I've seen her do it. I teach my kids to stay open minded and learn from example of others, I don't force anything down their throats. God gave us Free will and I intend for them to use it. And as for you degree, I read some of your past questions and if you have such a degree why are working at a Resturant? And by some of your other questions you don't journey to far out of you comfort zone. I don't care what others think or say about me, I'm proud to be who I am. You should be to!! I am not the smartest person in the world I admitt that, but at least my mind isn't consumed by what's popular in the world today, I dare to go out side the main stream and make decisions based on my own common sense.|`|Dl7xtjH9aa	They admit it because they see it as valid and see themselves as having a right to express their beliefs. neo-Nazi groups members are often proud of that membership.

f6b4ed1d7a49654fea30f1a9d16900a1aa	The spirit is perfect but far from being complete.  To achieve the state of completeness the spirit seeks every opportunity to fuse with material energy.  You're right, It is God innate nature to create or  be in touch with His physical side.  Wholeness is the name of the game.  The spirit is part of the whole, matter is the other part.  Jesus came back for his mangled body.  Why do you think it was necessary for him to do that if body is not important for the spirit?  Get my point there sis?|`|b5b3a78cd70d9312849f0cb75028d94aaa	All desires are not bad.

It might actually tell me stuff that wouldn't help me a bit, it would only make my existence more bitter. In the movie, the "truth" was indeed preferable to the blissful lie, but then the truth was also not *that* shocking, and knowing it might have meant being able to make a difference. So if I had some guarantee that knowing the truth would be actually useful, I'd take the red one. With no guarantee, however, my choice would be simply random.|`|nO4HtPeraa	I would rather know the truth. those who live in ignorance are a slave to ignorance and therfore limited. Those who know the truth are not bound by ignorance but are able to rise above it. Just as Nemo walked among all those living in ignorance after he took the red pill. he also saught out those who knew the truth, to find more truth.  truth sets us free and we are not restricted by it.  The power we have is within us.  Jesus said that if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed and say to the mountain "move" the mountain will move. Nothing shall be impossible to you. Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall Make you free.  And remember :"There is no spoon"

4a038898128194be10cac6fb2a7df7a5aa	She probably doesn't like the idea of being the submissive or receiving one in the relationship. She could be used to her role and doesn't like anything that makes her question it. If this change is sudden there might be an outside cause. It's amazing how many people will overcompensate when they start comparing themselves with others. Seems kind of immature but she might have shared it with a someone and got mocked or overheard someone talking about roles and felt insecure, but that's just purely speculation on my part.<br>  <br>  She needs to be sympathetic towards your sexual needs, and yes reciprocation is a need for many people. Let her know that you don't always like to be on the receiving end of everything and that you'd occasionally like to switch roles.

Let's explore this cause i was through teh same thing with my chick.<br>  <br>  Obviously it's something that you did-- or did NOT do. Could you have been lacking in intensity? Did you get to her clit and work on that? Did you unplease her somehow by overdoing it? (which is possible)? Did you watch and listen for signs of what SHE wants satisfied orally, and where she wants it?<br>  <br>  basically i've found that girls tell you things in their own language and you need to understand and pick up the clues and the cues.<br>  failing to do that can produce a negativity in a certain area, and in this case, she doesnt want you really going down on her. forget that she wants it around her strap, thats not going down on a chick.<br>  <br>  what can you do? well, you turned her off so now its up to you to turn her on again. my advice is to tell her how much you want to do it and please her, and ask why the sudden change. unless you can figure out whats gone wrong or where you made your mistake(s) and can try to correct it subtly. i found out what i did wrong myself-- she wanted me eating her out and using my finger in her a---hole. how in the world would i guess that? so she told me to stop going down on her. and i did, but i listened and listened and tried this and that till i hit it. and boy did she love it, all the way to orgasm city!!<br>  <br>  you'd be surprised how easy it is to make someone happy again and get what you want--to have your mouth in between her cheeks-- if you just play the game the right way. LISTEN and LISTEN to your partner!<br>  <br>  good luck and let me know how it goes, it'll all work out for you im sure if you just make her happy and listen to her needs, wants and dislikes.

While in in the Hebrew bible the Elohim still refers to the one G-d, grammatically it's plural. Could be a relic of a time that Jews weren't quite so monotheist, or a reference to the many parts of  the one God. I'm sure a better rabbinical scholar would have a better explanation of why it's written that way.|`|AA10527916	The word 'Eloha' means God, and its plural 'Elohim' means 'gods'. <br>  Elohim is usually translated as if it meant 'God'.|`|AA11056912	The Hebrew word ’elo·him′ (gods) appears to be from a root meaning “be strong.” ’Elo·him′ is the plural of ’eloh′ah (god). Sometimes this plural refers to a number of gods (Ge 31:30, 32; 35:2), but more often it is used as a plural of majesty, dignity, or excellence. ’Elo·him′ is used in the Scriptures with reference to Jehovah himself, to angels, to idol gods (singular and plural), and to men.<br>  <br>  When applying to Jehovah, ’Elo·him′ is used as a plural of majesty, dignity, or excellence. (Ge 1:1) Regarding this, Aaron Ember wrote: “That the language of the O[ld] T[estament] has entirely given up the idea of plurality in . . . [’Elo·him′] (as applied to the God of Israel) is especially shown by the fact that it is almost invariably construed with a singular verbal predicate, and takes a singular adjectival attribute. . . . [’Elo·him′] must rather be explained as an intensive plural, denoting greatness and majesty, being equal to The Great God.”—The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Vol. XXI, 1905, p. 208.|`|AA12327242	There is a difference. Eloah, is the name that only pertains to the One True God we see that from Prov 30:4-5"..." Every word of God [ELOAH] is flawless:..."<br>  <br>  The meaning is singular or one. Today, we know Him as God.<br>  <br>   The name is not plural, and it cannot be conferred or applied to more than one being. It only applies when referring to the Lord God, the Almighty. No one else can use it other than Him.<br>  <br>  Where as the word elohim is different. The word Elohim can refer to God or subordinate beings. It is interchangeable. Example. We know that Abraham was met by three elohim (Gen 18:2). One of those elohim was Christ. He stayed with Abraham while to other two elohim went down to Sodom (Gen 18:16) and were met by Abrahams nephew, Lot (Gen 19:1). <br>  <br>  If God Almighty is referred to as elohim, which is possible, a distinction is always applied. Example. <br>  <br>  Mar 12:36 For David himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, said, ‘The LORD said to my Lord, Sit in honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.’<br>  <br>  The translation here is "...The Elohim" said to "my elohim", Sit in..." We see two distinct beings. One is God (Eloah) and the other being is Christ. David recognises as Christ as an elohim, and that God, (The Elohim) is greater. <br>  <br>  See the link, it explains it in more detail.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.logon.org/english/s/p003.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.logon.org/english/s/p003.html</a>

Burger King here won't bother to do that because they don't see a financial incentive in it. But Burger King in Muslim countries will always be halaal because they have a financial incentive there as Muslims won't eat if otherwise. Although this is not a rule per say because it also depends on the franchise owner, he can go out of the way to make the meat halaal.

There are many similarities, despite the various tangents and divisive beliefs. All seemed to be attempts to reach out, to find God or enlightenment. <br>  <br>  Confronted with Jesus saying that he is the way, truth and life, it seemed his was similar to other claims. The exclusivity required, as other paths had, that I believe basic tenets of the belief to prove their validity. I decided to take him at his word, to consider the possibility that he may have been God incarnated as a man, and that his sacrificial death was required to bring mankind back into a relationship with God. Several other spiritual aspects experienced to this point in time, as well as research into the writings of Christian mystics and the bible fueled this desire to know the truth. I figured that if I did not agree, I would simply return to my previous beliefs.<br>  <br>  What I found was more than I could ever imagine. The truth was that God is a living and dynamic entity. The simple belief brought me to a place where God reached out to me, accepting me just as I was... touching my heart, mind and soul. My life completely changed from that experience. The amazing thing is that the experience does not end. It continues to grow and evolve over time, with a growing respect and love for Him.<br>  <br>  I had many strong beliefs in previous journeys along other paths.  All pale in comparison of coming to truly know the living God. I have had spiritual experiences with and through Him that you would simply not believe if I shared them. I agree whole heartedly the Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah. That He is indeed the only way. This truth is absolute, not vain imaginings or hopeful presumptions. God is alive and wishes that all would come to know and experience His great love and mercy that He has for us. My life has changed in such wondrous and amazing ways, that I have no desire to go back to the way I previously lived my life. My life in now one with Him, and I have full assurance that I will have eternal life with Him. It's not about religion or man's interpetations... it's about being and living with God.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you to understand what true Christianity is about. It seems to me that all the paths have lead me to here. Sadly, we do not all get there. Life here on this earth, as God intended it, is ours for the asking. We must ask and believe of our own free will. God is love, and this seems to be the common thread of all the paths. It is because we were made to love God. Only in Christ have I found God, who completes us and makes Himself real, to all who will believe. It is not the end of the journey.. it's the beginning.|`|ed0421b043032f615fb52c7e61381de7aa	There is only one way to get there.

Islam says that Jesus was just a prophet, and not the only way to God. Christianity says that there is a personal God, and that the only way to Him is through Jesus (John 14:6).

We believe  Loshon HaKodesh, the holy dialect of Hebrew, is the language of Heaven. To my humble knowledge, Muslims believe the same thing about Arabic.<br>  <br>  We have a tradition that members of the great Sanhedrin were able to speak in every language in the world, but I believe that was supposed to be an academic rather than spiritual achievement. It could also be they were helped along by the great spiritual holiness they had.

Well, I'm not sure, but I doubt it.  <br>  <br>  Pat Robertson was also supposedly told that a tsunami would hit the US in 2006, which obviously didn't happen, but could have, given the turmoil of a hurricane season we had in 2005.<br>  <br>  I personally think Pat Robertson makes likely predictions of what can happen, and when they are fulfilled, he expects us to be full of awe, and when they don't, he wants us to just brush them off.  I have no clue whether some or all of Pat Robertson's predictions are because he hears them from God or whether he makes all or most of them up, but I see no reason why anyone should treat each of them as absolute truth when it is shown that his predictions are not always correct.  I think they are purposefully ambiguous, while also leave room for catastrophic possibilities.<br>  <br>  For instance, this "mass killing" the US can expect in 2007, could easily be considered as fulfilled if just 10 people die, but also leaves room for the possibility that can include hundreds of people.  It is probably all a ruse to get people riled up.|`|120e161334f999f228fde5b57c40591aaa	No I think that Pat Robertson is just a big jerk who uses his ability to tell really incredible lies to scare his blue haired audience into signing over their social security checks to him.|`|7c53db50473719d5ce5cac583eca7ffeaa	I think He probably yells at Pat to stop annoying Him.|`|7e8e5a92bdab021065f74f6ee1873570aa	yes why not .....the mental patent that i pass on my way to work everyday tells me he speaks to him all the time|`|8a8345deabd705efa71a49527745033eaa	you are just weird|`|9ee5baef2985ff7f63cad211f730cf4faa	I think he speaks to himself<br>  Little questions like how can I strengthen my political alliances and make loads more money<br>  Though I understand that a lot of Christians would think that he talks to god.

Deueteronomy 18:21,22<br>  <br>  Pat admits he is sometimes wrong and according to scripture if a man claims to be speaking from God and those things, yes it means all things do not come to pass, then that man is not from God.

By your question you premise that God is and by being a god he is fully capable of shutting Pat Robertson or anyone else up that is contrary to his will.   The Bible is full of patriarchs that made mistakes and were in their moments of human leading in error and wrong but God used them anyway  -- as the scriptures put it He places heavenly treasures in earthen vessels and using the small things to confound the mighty and the foolish things in the eyes of men to undo that which seems wise in the eyes of men.<br>  <br>  If Pat Robertson or any person produces fruit/works  and speaks words that are congruent with the mind and will of God manifested in the Bible which is God message to man then do they not hear from God?  <br>  <br>  Other than that , again, God is quite capable of raising Pat up or bringing him down  and needs no human inquisition to defend his words from those that claim to speak for him for as the scriptures say he makes all things to work for good  -- even the words of Pat -- toward those that are called according to his purpose.  <br>  <br>  So the question, are you called according to his purpose and walking in his covenant and gathering for Him is the better one and in the affirmative works all things even he words of Pat to your benefit either by their contrast or their compliment.|`|cf8a2673835ac187668dd5e3c24213d2aa	God speaks to us all...

1fed4a470ce857eb2b8ac16ef8dd4db2aa	In states ruled by Islamic law, jizya or jizyah (Arabic: ?????; Ottoman Turkish cizye) is a per capita tax imposed on free non-Muslim adult males who are neither old nor sick nor monks known as dhimmis, in exchange for being allowed to live, practice their faith, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy as well as being "entitled to Muslim protection from outside aggression and being exempted from military service".  In return for the tax, those who paid the jizya were permitted to keep their non-Muslim religion. They could not serve in the military or bear arms, but their community was considered to be under the protection of the Muslim state, subject to their meeting certain conditions. Non-Muslims were also exempt from zakat, or mandatory charity paid by Muslims. If someone refused to pay the jizya, he could be imprisoned, according to Abu Yusuf.<br>  The prophet of Islam said: “Whoever hurts a non Muslim, I shall be his complainant and for whoever I am a complainant, I shall ask for his right on the day of Resurrection.” (Hadith)<br>  He also said: “ Whoever persecutes a non Muslim or demands work from him beyond his capacity or takes something from him with evil intentions, I shall be a complainant against him on the day of Resurrection.”(Hadith)  Prophet Mohammed said: “ One who hurts a non-Muslim, he hurts me and one who hurts me, hurts God.” (Hadith) <br>  Qur’an says: “… and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious.” (16: 125)<br>  <br>  Again the prophet said: “ Whoever relieves a human being from a grief of this world, God will relieve him from a grief on the day of judgment.” (Hadith)<br>  <br>  So, Islamic teachings concerning social responsibilities are based on kindness and consideration of others. Muslims and non-Muslims alike have the right to live in peace and harmony hence the Islamic constitution ensures justice for all.<br>  <br>  Freedom of religious practice, conscience, association, citizenship, law, are some types of guarantees that should be given to the non-Muslims and to minorities living under the protection of an Islamic state.<br>  A great deal on the rights of the non-Muslims has been emphasized in Islam to be enjoyed without any interference, so that any Muslim who violates these rights is considered to be wrong.  Moreover, a Muslim is allowed to marry a non-Muslim, Christian or Jew, and should give her the liberty to practice her religion without interfering or questioning her going to the church or to synagogue or drinking alcohol or practicing any other customs.<br>  In addition to that, non-Muslims living in the Islamic states have the right of practicing their own customs such as eating pork and drinking alcohol, which are forbidden to Muslims.<br>  <br>  Islamic teachings instruct the Muslims to respect and cooperate with the followers of other religions and treat them equally provided they reciprocate the same feeling.|`|873600a579b41132ecb67c4dfa0414a9aa	there are no non muslim s in Islam>Islam is the faith Muslims are the people|`|8fc0f29e5f684e0f05232b5edaa74fb6aa	what do you mean a non-muslim in muslim?    give an example.

Allah's Apostle said, "Do not kill him." Al-Miqdad said, "But O Allah's Apostle! He had chopped off one of my hands and he said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?" The Prophet said.

(John 8:57-59)<br>  <br>  "I and the Father are one." The Jews took up stones again to stone Him. Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?" The Jews answered Him, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God." (John 10:30-33)<br>  <br>  And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me does not believe in Me, but in Him who sent Me. And he who beholds Me beholds the One who sent Me. I have come as light into the world, that everyone who believes in Me may not remain in darkness." (John 12:44-46)<br>  <br>  And so when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and reclined at the table again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you? You call Me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet." (John 13:12-14)<br>  <br>  Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through Me. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have seen Him." Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."

This isn't true. Like all Jews, Ashkenazim claim descent from Jacob. Of Noah's three sons, they are descended from Shem.<br>  <br>  So why are they called Ashkenazim. It was believed in Judaism, that the original peoples of Europe were descendants of Japeth, and the original tribes of Germany were descendants of Ashkenaz. Because of this belief, the word for Germany in Loshon HaKodesh (the Holy Dialect of Hebrew in Judaism) is Ashkenaz. So Ashkenaz is both the name of Japeth's one son, and the name of Germany in Hebrew.<br>  <br>  The Jews who settled in  Germany were given the name Ashkenazi by their fellow Jews - meaning German, in Hebrew. It is derived from the place name, not the name of Japhet's son. <br>  <br>  (BTW, Ashkenaz is the word for Germany in Loshon HaKodesh, the Holy dialect of Hebrew; but in Ivrit Tzioni, the dialect used in Israel, its name is Germania, with the G hard like in Good. Interesting fact.)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

It is evil to the core, and nothing more. Be it Catholic, Jehovah Witness, Islam, Mormon, or a denomination spinoff saying "you have to do this to be a church member here, but not there"....it's crowd manipulation, heart tearing, and pure evil masked.<br>  <br>  Christ died FOR your sins by shedding God's perfect blood as a sacrifice, a substitute for me and for you and for ALL. He willingly laid down his life and allowed himself to be crucified to a cross. <br>  <br>  Believe in his shed blood as a once and final payment for your sin debt unto God, and put no trust nor faith in your "good deeds", deep thoughts, religion(s) or religious dogma, world or personal circumstances, philosophy, lifestyle, education, evolution, your senses, church attendance,religious attitudes, feelings, family traditions, supposed "holy or religious saving" laws or ordinances, self serving prayers, etc.<br>  <br>  Christ alone went in your place as your substitute to pay for the sins you've already done, the one's you're currently doing, and all that you'll do in the future.

(Acts 16:31) God will judge you to be whole and sinless in his eyes, imputing Christ's righteousness unto you; Christ's faith unto you; and you in Christ. <br>  <br>  You won't feel it based on experience; you'll know it based on the word of truth.

Their unity is absolute.  God, the Creator, saith: There is no distinction whatsoever among the Bearers of My Message.  They all have but one purpose; their secret is the same secret.  To prefer one in honor to another, to exalt certain ones above the rest, is in no wise to be permitted.  Every true Prophet hath regarded His Message as fundamentally the same as the Revelation of every other Prophet gone before Him.  …<br>      The measure of the revelation of the Prophets of God in this world, however, must differ.  Each and every one of them hath been the Bearer of a distinct Message, and hath been commissioned to reveal Himself through specific acts.  It is for this reason that they appear to vary in their greatness.  …<br>     … God’s purpose in sending His Prophets unto men is twofold.  The first is to liberate the children of men from the darkness of ignorance, and guide them to the light of true understanding.  The second is to ensure the peace and tranquility of mankind, and provide all the means by which they can be established. …”  -Baha'u'llah|`|bfa75d96961fa09394073134fb6e8bdfaa	Because of religion....other countries wanting to be better than others....many other things.|`|c05f7a109f1963d254a25f83a1ecf0ebaa	evry religious people see their religion the best and the only religion to follow other by marginalising other religions.this led the hatred against other religion and when any religion face the problem of hatred and marginalisation then this led the war in term of jihad,crusade etc.|`|smjh95bpaa	because of the Abrahamic three, they want to take over the world with thier religions.

6a13e6e342d67f323794868e0525a75faa	The Bible was written over a period of 1500 years--off an on until about 100 a.d. Numerous men wrote portions at different times on scrolls as God, through the Holy Spirit, worked in there lives. The ten commandments were the only thing carved in stone--the rest was written on scrolls.|`|31d59c172cb148cec827c08b541ea8b6aa	The stories of the Old Testament were told orally until about the sixth century B.C.  Then a scribe, possibly Ezekiel, wrote them down.  About 400 years later Ptolemy was building the greatest library in the world at Alexandria, Egypt.  Since there were many Hellenistic Jews in Egypt who could not read Hebrew, Ptolemy wanted a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures for his library.  So, he petitioned Judea to send scribes to Egypt to translate the scriptures.  They went, made the translation and it is called the Septuagint (Greek for seventy, after the traditional seventy scribes).  The Septuagint quickly became the most widely accepted translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (Jesus and the apostles used it).  Then after Jesus died many of the apostles wrote down what they had learned from Him in stories, synopsizes, letters, apologies (explanations), etc.  These writings, as well as others (Clement's letters to the Corinthians, Barnabas, The Shepherd Hermas, etc.) began to be regarded as equally scriptural as the Hebrew Scriptures.  There was more than a little disagreement about which writings were 'inspired' until about the turn of the forth century A.D., when the Bible took the form that we have today.<br>  <br>  ***Alternate Ending***<br>  In the sixteenth century, Martin Luther rejected several books from the Old as well as New Testament cannons, because they were too difficult to reconcile with his new form of Christianity.  The German royals who were protecting Luther from his many enemies put pressure on him to put the New Testament books back into his version of the Bible.  He eventually gave in, but still added the word "only" to his translation of a key verse in Romans.  Subsequent followers of his revolt removed the imprudently inserted word, but never restored the Old Testament books that Luther removed.

It's rare that any of them show up on this plane, but I have had some glimpses. <br>  They are large enough, they're about 1.25 times the size of a lion. Some species have wings, others prefer to live without them. The number of legs also varies. They live together as loose packs. Alone, but not apart. They're varying as far as personality traits go. They're a bit like horses, in that respect. Some dragons can be quite mean, and don't like to be messed with, whereas others are kind and friendly.

The dragon represent the Yang in the Taoist religion and it is balanced with the Chinese Phoenix. In fact, the representation of the emperor is the Five clawed dragons. In Meso-America religion, we have Quetzalcoatl, or the feathered serpent. He was the patron gods of the priests. When Cortes, first encountered the Aztecs, the Aztecs thought that Cortes was Quetzalcoatl. <br>  In the west, the dragon is associated with the Devil ( Most likely because of the garden of Eden story where the devil Came to Eve as a serpent). They are there for the saints  and knights to overcome (please see: St. George and the Dragon; Saint Martha  and the Tarrasque). or in Norway during the time of Ragnarok (the twilight of the Norse gods) the midgard serpent is suppose to kill Thor (the God of thunder) .|`|hwZ4zKfBaa	A Dragon can be an evil entity such as the devil.<br>  <br>  O yea Dragons have wings.<br>  <br>  "Quack" says the German "Quack".

Have a prayer time with her family. From that moment on, they would not work until Saturday 6 pm. Everything was prepare before hand. They don't believe in Resurrection the same way other Christians do. They believe we will resurrect only when Jesus comes back. They don't eat pork. Somehow, Saturday is more important than Jesus. At least that is what I felt.|`|AA11472749	Adventist believe some very strange things!!!  One of the worst is.... they believe the first test for salvation is believing in Christ and the second test is: keeping the Seventh day (Saturday) Sabbath.  If you reject the second test or you fail to keep it....you will go to hell regardless of whether you believe in Christ. <br>  <br>  They do not believe in the rapture.  They do believe in resurrection.  At death they believe your body, soul and spirit lie dead in the grave until the time of Christ's return.  They laugh hysterically at funerals when people of other faiths pray and talk about their loved ones being in heaven or with God.  <br>  <br>  The basis for all their doctrines comes from a woman named Ellen White.  She would faint, remain in a rigid state, sometimes for hours before she would arise to say, "God has shown me........"    <br>  <br>  God showed her there was life on Pluto and that the door of salvation was shut in 1844 (meaning if you weren't saved at that point then you couldn't be)....after it became obvious that babies were being born and couldn't be saved because God had closed the door on salvation then she had another vision were "God showed her.....something else to cover up the mistake he made for telling her he had shut the door of salvation.. "   This is the pattern for many of the believes....ever changing to cover up the errors without admitting they are wrong.   <br>  <br>  My point is...the woman was 'shown by God' many things that never took place and she is clearly a false prophet, however, the group of believers tenaciously hold on to her words as the "light" from God. <br>  <br>  Beware of the adventist...........|`|2170e13a94378004c164387255e5ec4daa	Their policy on what subject?<br>  <br>  Go to their website:<br>  <a href="http://www.adventist.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adventist.org/</a><br>  <br>  Under the "Adventist Beliefs" tab on the left of the menu bar, see their Fundamental Beliefs, Official Statements and Guidelines.|`|90ac9d9efdf7e4e91de271eb3726a5cbaa	The opinion of the Seventh Day Adventist church is they have the TRUTH. Therefore if you do not believe as they do you do not have the truth. Guess that means your religion is a lie. Actually most of them do believe your religion is a lie.  <br>  <br>  They also believe they have the SPIRIT OF PROPHECY.  They use Revelation 19:10 (last part) to determine that those who have the truth have The Spirit of Prophecy so they have a group of books Titled Testimony’s to the Church  (they also call you guessed it THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY)written by a devout woman Ellen Gould (White) who they claim was a prophet. James white used his wife’s probably catatonic episodes to claim she was in vision.  She would then say pretty much what he told her under hypnotism. <br>  <br>  Ellen had been seriously injured as a child by being hit in the face with a rock and was not ever able to return to school past third grade. <br>  <br>  However she was a devout God Loving Christian. When she began to criticize the actions of the church leaders they exiled her to Australia with a secretary (keeper) who edited (censored) all her further communication.  By the way the Spirit of prophecy series has been edited several times even once that I know of in the last 60 years and the book The Great Controversy has had a chapter removed because it was not considered politically correct.

They believe in the Resurrection, the 10 commandments, basically everything in the bible. They believe that you have to use more than one scripture when you search for answers in the bible. Yes, they also believe Saturday is very important, no not more than God, but important none the less. It is because Saturday is the seventh day of the week, and according to the 10 commandments, we are to rest on the seventh day, to be able to learn about and praise God.

They are stuck in a car in the traffic, with pollution and noise everywhere, and the father shouts "I wanna get outa heeeeeeere". Next scene you see is the rocky mountains. What a contrast! They move there, build a cabin and have to fight wolves, bears and cheetahs. Well, you don't have to go to that extreme, but I guess the closer we live to nature (for example, in a village), the more "natural" the rythm is to man, and the easier it is to bare.

3f38df35eb4b54f5105aa2da08a818fdaa	Zorastriansim is an ancient religion that was initially followed in Iran. Today its followers number in the thousands. It is the fastest dying religion. Followers of this religions are called Parsees. There is a significant minority in India. Ahura Mazda is probably their God. They do not bury or cremate the dead.

Mazdaism is the religion that acknowledges the divine authority of Ahura Mazda, proclaimed by Zoroaster to be the one uncreated Creator of all (God).<br>  <br>  As demonstrated by Zoroastrian creed and articles of faith, the two terms are effectively synonymous. In a declaration of the creed — the Fravarānē — the adherent states: "…I profess myself a devotee of Mazda, a follower of Zarathustra." (Yasna 12.2, 12.8)<br>  <br>  Zoroastrianism was once the dominant religion of much of Western- and Central Asia but as of 2007 practiced only by fewer than 200,000 worldwide,[1] with its largest center in India.
3f38df35eb4b54f5105aa2da08a818fdaa	well one difference I know is the Christian takes place in the church mostly. They ask the bride and groom whether they accept each other.

d82fcb6de9ce28d93513b91d4bdf93b2aa	Frankly, the main thing that you'll get out of participating here is an understanding of how poorly developed most people's religious side is. <br>  <br>  I've learned that faith is largely absent from religion, at least among the believers here, as most insist that they have evidence or even proof for their beliefs. There's a fair amount of mental illness here among believers as well, and it has become more clear to me as a result of participating that religion persists largely because of its strong appeal to desperate people who cannot cope with their place in the real world. <br>  <br>  I am sometimes dismayed at some of the juvenile insults that come from people on my side of the fence as well, and I probably excuse those more than I should. I'm also amazed at how many nonbelievers get excited about "Biblical contradictions", as though what's wrong with religious belief is that there are some errors in the details. <br>  <br>  I've also learned that many people - both believers and agnostics - mistakenly believe that being an atheist means claiming to be 100% certain that there is no god. Obviously such a claim would be wrong, but you don't have to claim 100% certainty to say that you don't believe that there is a god, or even to say that you know there is no god. That point is lost on many believers, which isn't surprising, but I am surprised to find that it's also lost on many agnostics. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of good answers though from atheists, and sometimes believers manage to come through with good posts as well. In this environment, I find that very impressive: there are certainly some good ones out there.|`|d18a7c1a67198c269bf100c4f1e7500caa	This site is meant to ask and answer questions.

Religion is no deferent than old times politics seeking control and power at the expanse of ignorance and naiveté. On the other hand, spirituality and faith are exclusively personal qualities that have absolutely nothing to do with organized religion(s). <br>  <br>  So, if you really want to get closer to God, you must use your own personal spirituality and/or faith to accomplish that. The hypocritical baselessness of any religion won’t do that for you or anyone else. Joining any religion and expecting to get you closer to god is like joining a political party to get you closer to a truly constitutional democracy.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA12392758	I'm not sure.

"Although what you see is not dissimilar to art, 'experience' is really the only term that can quantify what Hell.com really is." <br>  <br>  <br>  Hell.com's second so-called experience, skinonskinonskin, a poetic multimedia documentary of a real-life love affair between two members of Hell.com, launched 13 May for private guest preview only. Notable Web developers Michael Samyn of Zuper and Auriea Harvey of Entropy 8, designed <br>  it. <br>  <br>  Nonmembers of Hell.com can join the skinonskinonskin email list of 50,000 "guests," if they can find their way through a series of ominous black screens at the Hell.com home page. It isn't supposed to be easy: a pop-up window proclaiming "No entry" greets you, only to be followed with a black screen bearing the word "no." <br>  <br>  <br>  "The attitude is huge when you first try to get onto Hell.com. You feel like you're waiting outside a Manhattan club waiting to be picked for entry," says Jon Winet, a new media artistwho teaches at the Center for Digital Media at the San Francisco Art Institute. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Once inside, you discover an elegant aesthetic, and the designers whose work is presented are obviously very respectful of bandwidth and are thus <br>  not elitist."<br>  <br>  (End quote)<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this post was July 1999.

Pin the edges all around. draw a human type figure. Then pin around it so it doesnt slide. Using a scissor cut out the figure. Sew all except the bottom. Stuff the doll with either cotton or any other natural material. Get an item from the person such as a strand of hair , nail , saliva or anything that once was a permanent part of that person and either stuff it in the doll or attach it to the doll with glue, tape etc.Then sew the bottom shut. You can draw or sew items for the face, hair etc. Best if it looks like the person your intent is for.

Of course God did not want me dating and I knew it but fooled myself into thinking it was ok that I made Du'ah about it!!! Now your relationship with the Muslim, was also terrible and it sounds to me that if he mistreated you so harshly he couldnt be very good a muslim at all!  Make du'ah that you will find a way out make it with pure heart, and firm belief that anything you ask of will be granted, make all your salah withought skipping one, and try your best to live halal you will see how God will answer! Insha'allah you will find guidance in my words, for I too have been down this path.<br>   As a revert myself I can honestly say that after your family sees how much of a better person you have become for the sake of God, they will indeed take you back , and after you have your witnesses to testify for you about the abuse, and you go to a sheikh to go on with the divorce, your family will indeed take you back, trully God does not leave his sincere followers behind!!|`|f2c85836d5efc6cff05b8647d6dfa2aaaa	Dear Muslim..I am at your service...plz wait and dont feel depressed I will answer ur question...few minutes plz.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NEW:<br>  <br>  Ok lets see here. First of all what kind of abuse does he do??? Anyway // no kind of abuse is allowed in Islam..So if he has been abusive for 3-4 years thats enough. Now lets see what can be done.. You dont know how to cook even?? Where do u live? Is it possible that u get a job at a safe place as a cook..like someones place..I see u are having a hard time and My GOD I hope Allah subhanawatAllah is pleased with u since u still love Islam by Allahs grace and u see since it was ur assosiation with God that made ur parents disown u Allah will inshAllah help u since u did it for his sake.. I will inshAllah mek loads of DUA for u and in the mean time try earning some money behind ur husbands back like by sowing clothes of neighbours and then u could open a small account in the bank or pay in cash to an online course like embroidry or some other skill like learning simple WEB SITE DESIGNING...infact website designing is so so simple and its available for free!! I u need any help contact me ok! Im a Bachelors in Information Technology! and then work online for many companies that pay u upto 100 dollars for 1 to 2 hours work!! se now we are getting somewhere sister.. dont get depressed...inshAllah a solution is coming forward! while ur hubs at work u can earn money. While u do anyonline JOB u can also ask the employers that you need a certificate for all the time u work.  Then when u get enough money  and a 6month to a years experience and u have a certificate in hand u can go and ask any place to help u find a job like a newspaper agency or go directly to a firm that does computer operation...u type well honey...<br>  So first u need a rope to hold onto before u leave and say good bye to ur husband. Make sure u find a job..some cash and an apartment or a room in a safe environment before u leave ur husband and keep all this secret and only reveal it on the last day when u leave. If possible also talk to police department on phone about custody of children and also free education incase ur husband is abusive ..which ofcourse applies to u. <br>  <br>  Ok , now u have to contact me and feed back me at what u think of my plan...Even if it is 10% possible. I will help u make a new plan. I can help u inshAllah! Help me help u..<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS YOU.<br>  <br>  OK MORE:  <br>  <br>  <br>  If u are in an arab state...maybe the mutawwa will be the best person to contact of the imam of a mosque..he will surely keep ur situation a secret aswell. In Saudia Arabia the mutawwas would be kind hopefully.<br>  <br>  If ur husband says stuff like the police will take both of us he is a biggest liar! Saudi Police would not let him free unless they really got all the sence into him..They would not take his ****!

All news networks have people behind them secretly pushing their agendas, so as long as there's diversity and equal opportunity, then it's fair. I don't tend to believe anything too seriously I hear on any show, since I know none of them are objective anyway. Most of it is designed to be inflammatory, to promote one point of view anyway.|`|KZQqsim0aa	I've given up watching television a few years ago but I've seen plenty of FOX News and don't particularly care for it however I hate CNN and some of the others just as much. I can't stand Bill O'Reilly but don't have any major problem with Sean Hannity except that I just don't agree with him on some things as he's too conservative for me. I can't say I consider FOX any worse than anything else but I just disagree with them for their overt conservatism whereas I disagree with the others for either being too liberal or other miscellaneous stupid things. <br>  <br>  You have to keep in mind that something like CNN has different versions so even if you like it in one country doesn't mean you would like it in another. Most of the American news here is so focused on celebrities or the latest young woman to go missing and they'll spend weeks and weeks reporting on the latest updates of where this woman you've never heard of might be located or and who might have done it or their overt obsession on the hippest democratic candidate and the whole political rat race, etc. There is almost nothing in the way of foreign news or even much outside the NYC, DC, L.A. triangle. I've given up on this and mostly read international news online now although I won’t say that is perfect either. One thing you have to understand about O'Reilly is that I read somewhere the median age of his viewers is over the age of 70 (some of his competitors are pushing 60 or more though). A lot of younger people like myself have tuned out and just read the news off the Internet OR watch something like satire/comedy (like the Daily Show or late night comedians) talking about the news and in the latter case it's sad because it's not the news of course and leads to ignorance- to say nothing of what I consider a lot of silliness as well.|`|Zte3iIBlaa	Im a Brit and watch it sometimes and think O`reilly is so up his own **** and hannity is also it beggars believe.
Md7y5KSYaa	The role of Muhammad was simply to purify Gods message on Earth therby establishing *Islam in a pure form. Since the Bible and the Old Testament had ben changed through translating, and purposeful manipulation, God sent Angel Gabriel to reveal the pure message to muhammad simply that God should be whorshipped as one and one alone, like Abraham did, and that Jesus(pbuh)was the messiah but not gods son nor god himself, as that was an impurity introduced into religion through Paul, and others. Muhammad(pbuh) and his followers faced attacks bu many surrounding people, and God told Muhammad(pbuh) he must defend himself as Joshua(pbuh) of the old testament did, In doing so Muhammad(pbuh) gave people the choice of Following God in Islam instead of diying in battle, unlike Joshua(pbuh) who simply killed his enemies with out giving them an alternative, in doing so he gained many followers, and also gained many followers from people who gave him assylum from those who persecuted him. The king of Ethiopia became a Muslim after hearing about Muhammad, as did many other people around him. As the final prophet of God Muhammad(pbuh) established the pure religion on solid ground, and had thousands of believers douring his lifetime.|`|f4fb7d65e0dfd5898923f7623ab4284baa	Besides being the Author of Islam you mean?|`|AA10896378	I think thats where they started their "Bible"<br>  Not back to Jesus.<br>  <br>  But don't quote me.|`|EGCHpApIaa	beware of muhammad the robber, raper, murderer, pedophile, false prophet of doom, jesus wannabee.<br>  <br>  John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>  <br>  yah, muhammad is in the bible.......<br>  <br>  this one best describes him....... and evil islam<br>  Matthew 7:15 (Whole Chapter) <br>  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:11 (Whole Chapter) <br>  And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:24 (Whole Chapter) <br>  For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. <br>  <br>  Mark 13:22 (Whole Chapter) <br>  For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. <br>  <br>  Luke 6:26 (Whole Chapter) <br>  Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. <br>  <br>  2 Peter 2:1 (Whole Chapter) <br>  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. <br>  <br>  1 John 4:1 (Whole Chapter) <br>  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.   <a href="http://bible.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bible.com/</a>|`|OGYKwNU3aa	he made peace treaties when he was in positions of weakness then broke them when he gained enough political power.

He at first was friendly toward the Jewish faith but later became more hostile to it.

Today most Christians in Islamic countries live under persecution and thousands are martyred, particularly right now, in the Sudan, Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia.|`|Yeek5s2kaa	Although the Brophet (Bbuhhhhhhhhhhhh......) in his latter days orders the unruly Arabs to stob fighting he did show them the way how to sbread Islam.

It was done by destroying their blaces of worshib, converting them to mosques, burning ancient libraries, and declaring any blace Muslims steb on as Muslim lands for eternity.

The Navajo people still have a mystical bond to this redstone canyon that cuts an almost tropical path of trees and flowers through the desert. Canyon de Chelly is home to several periods of Indian culture dating from 350 A.D. to 1300 A.D., and the 26-mile canyon's sheer cliffs range from 30 to more than 1,000 feet, providing a spetacular backdrop for hundreds of Anasazi ruins, as well as modern Navajo homes and farms. The visitor's center offers details and maps to all of the canyon's many world-famous sites, including Spider Rock, White House Ruins and Canyon del Muerto. From the sandy canyon floor by all-terrain vehicle, or from the rim on a self-guided tour by car, Canyon de Chelly is one of Navajoland's most popular all-day adventures.

Good intentions can have either positive or negative responses because we do not always know what is BEST and RIGHT.  I serve my fellow man through my conscious, the Bible, and the Spirit of God.  Because I am an imperfect creature, there is no way of knowing if I am making the BEST or RIGHT choice based upon my intentions.  As far as forgiving people that wronged you, you should ALWAYS forgive them.  Unwillingness to forgive the person who offended you doesn't only keep that relationship soiled for as long as it takes to forgive that person, it also becomes a cancer to your soul.  It starts as anger, then bitterness, and then hatred.  It is like having a rotting corpse chained to your back (all your thoughts will be on revenge, you will have no peace, and even your sense of smell and taste will be affected).  Have you ever wronged someone else?  Yes, it is called sin.  In the same way you judge others, you too will be judged.  Forgive and you will be forgiven.  How can you forgive others if you first haven't been forgiven?  Ask God to forgive your sins.  Jesus Christ took the punishment for ALL of yours and mine.  He died and rose from the dead.  All you need to do is turn from your sins and ask Jesus Christ to forgive you.  If you do this, you will have a true relationship with the living God.  He will then live in you by his Holy Spirit.  He will make you into a new creature and lead you into all truth.  You will have eternal life.  As far as war and politics are concerned, they exist because we live in a world where there is evil.  You cannot understand this without first knowing God.  It is only through Jesus Christ.  You cannot earn salvation; it is a gift.|`|ODiPnIlCaa	While people following good intentions is good, it doesn't mean everybody should follow their personal intentions. One, too many people have different standards of what is "good." Two, don't do something that you think is good to everybody else. How you act should be based on how others will react. Every action requires thought. Think about the repercussions of your actions, and how people affected will think of it. Unfortunately, not very many people follow this (including me, I'm not saying I am the one with the truth), so you must learn to forgive others, even if their intentions were not good. Three, if people followed their good intentions, then some would say killing others is good (Hitler) and others would say politics and government control are good (Bush). It depends on personal belief and upbringing in the world. Following good intentions would not solve problems in the world.

I have noticed as well that is the way things are... and it makes absolutely no sense.  The only way that race makes a difference is if someone is being racist/prejudice.  If someone thinks the only reason that they can't pursue a relationship with someone is because they are black, then that person is either racist themselves or has been dragged down by the absolute idiocy of racism.<br>  <br>  I will NEVER understand why people have so much hatred in them.

Zal, which is the same thing.<br>  <br>  The last two are used only for famous sages though. Alaiv Hashalom is the most common. It's usually slurred to ALava Shalom.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	I would also add "zichronam tzaddikim livracha", abbreviated ztl, which means "may the memory of the righteous be a blessing"; this is said just prior to reading the list of names of those people who have passed away during a particular part of the worship service.|`|tR5XJljGaa	It seems to be a Christian phrase.

My girlfriend and I went on an Olivia cruise to South Africa. Absolutely breathtaking. Extremely fun (and expensive) but we started preparing for it a yr in advance so we made monthly payments and paid the total price off in installments. We were never bored. There was truly sumthing for everyone on that ship. Dancing (all typed of music), excellent food buffets ( i gained like 5 pounds), games, nitely shows that were awesome. We made a few friends that we still keep in touch with and they are flying out to California to visit this summer.|`|AA10663644	Craven buddy, you can cruise for me anytime!

They are lots of fun.  My suggestions -<br>  <br>  1) Take a cruise that docks somewhere, not just an ocean cruise.  This means that you can actually get OFF the ship and see something.  My cruises have been in the S. Mediterranean and Western Mexico.<br>  <br>  2) The less formal, the better.  Ask the line if there is a night (or more than one) with a dress code.  This means more things that you have to pack.<br>  <br>  3) Don't overload yourself with activities off the boat.  And there will be LOTS of activities on the boat as well.  Heh heh.  No, I mean like tea dances, jogging, swimming, entertainment, trivia, etc. (dirty mind!)<br>  <br>  4) Book WELL in advance to get a good cabin selection, and get the travel insurance.  Try to get a balcony room if you can afford it (you have a place to sit outside, and to dry clothes).  An "ocean view" room = porthole.  The cabins may seem tiny, but you're not in them a lot anyway, even when at sea.<br>  <br>  Have fun!  Good luck!

He is very intelligent. He can seem very cool. He has been deceiving people for millenia. He tells you you'll have fun, but he won't tell you there are consequences. Example? Sex. If you have sex with a guy, it may be fun and feel great. When he has sex with someone else, it doesn't. STD's don't. Jealous boy/girlfriends or spouses don't. Especially if they come after you. Satan only paints the positive, and whitewashes the negative. Drugs? Self-explanatory. Ever lied to someone, and they found out later? I bet that wasn't a pleasant experience. Look at all the relationship problems we have because of lies and sex. Countless. People get hurt and killed over those things. Satan will never tell you those things could happen, but they often do.|`|fPbv0qvfaa	Yea, yea. Satan's cool.

If it was on a mass scale people would be in outrage; Non- muslim Indians Hindus, Christians, Atheists,Jews, etc... will not like it especially if muslims wanted more spaces to do whatever else.<br>  <br>  It is silly to give a group of people (in this case Muslims) a 'different room for prayer' just to make them feel at home... next we'll leave the room if they enter because we're eating pork. I don't see Christians, Jews and even Atheist of late wanting soo much consideration for their belife / unbelief...In fact its taken outside of the work place, classrooms etc. they live side by side. If you ask me, Muslims wanting this, is because they don't want to intergrate - but seperate.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	weird where i am we have a multi-faith room which any religion can use, and before that nothing!!<br>  <br>  me thinks your just trying to stir up hate|`|QVKWVValaa	Sigh...<br>  The schools are accommodating of the students faith. The schools are not teaching the faiths doctrines. There is a huge difference.<br>  No one, not one single liberal, is trying to stop the practice of a persons faith. Liberals are trying to stop the establishment of one religion's doctrinal practices and beliefs as dominant over all others. Again, that is a huge difference.<br>  That these Muslim students get their own prayer room is a clear indication of the liberal agenda: give all people the chance to practice their faith, as long as it isn't forced on others.<br>  Got it?|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Separation of church and state doesn't mean to me that people must abandon their beliefs when they enter school grounds or the Senate. It means to me that the government cannot promote or deny religion.<br>  <br>  Christian prayer is informal, but Muslim prayer is said daily at set times. Accommodating such a formal practice is appropriate. In fact, I don't see why the same rooms wouldn't be allowed for prayer and meditation for anyone.<br>  <br>  I often hear the same misunderstanding on the prayer in public school issue, that some people believe people aren't allowed to pray in school. That's not true. What's disallowed is the school mandating prayer.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	I'm just glad they do it in a separate room.

It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith. 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law"<br>  <br>  Amy, Jesus taught all about the things you are asking. In Matthew 11:25-30 <br>  <br>  25At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.<br>  26Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.<br>  27All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.<br>  28Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<br>  29Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<br>  30For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. <br>  <br>  Jesus spoke clearly about the reality of the coming judgement in Matthew 13:19-50:<br>  <br>  19When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.<br>  20But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;<br>  21Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.<br>  22He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.<br>  23But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.<br>  24Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:<br>  25But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.<br>  26But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.<br>  27So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?<br>  28He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?<br>  29But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.<br>  30Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.<br>  31Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:<br>  32Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.<br>  33Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.<br>  34All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:<br>  35That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.<br>  36Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.<br>  37He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;<br>  38The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;<br>  39The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.<br>  40As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.<br>  41The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;<br>  42And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br>  43Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br>  44Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.<br>  45Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:<br>  46Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.<br>  47Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<br>  48Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<br>  49So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<br>  50And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. <br>  <br>  Jesus also answered this question very clearly when he confronted the chief priests and elders in Matthew 21. They sought to accuse Jesus and condem him because they were jealous of him and his following. But he spoke this parable to them:<br>  <br>  "28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.<br>  29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.<br>  30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.<br>  31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.<br>  32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him." <br>  <br>  You see here - Jesus, talking to the chief priests and elders of the people. He said that the publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before them, because the preists and elders refuse to repent and believe. He also spoke another parable about Himself:<br>  <br>  "33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:<br>  34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.<br>  35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.<br>  36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.<br>  37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.<br>  38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.<br>  39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.<br>  40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?<br>  41They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.<br>  42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?<br>  43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.<br>  44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.<br>  <br>  Jesus Himself represents the Son of the housholder who was put to death. God sent Jesus, His Son into the world, and the world rejected Him. Jesus is the "stone which the builders rejected," and it is He which is become the "Chief Cornerstone." <br>  Finally - to show what is needed for salvation, we have the example from the crucifixion of Jesus, of the thief on the cross in Luke 23:39-43<br>    42And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.<br>   43And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.

No harshness to it.<br>  <br>  Some of the language must've derived from arabic, because if you look at old Persian handwriting, it looked more like Greek than arabic. But I'm not sure.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	Farsi over Arabic any day. Arabic is so guttural it sounds like Klingon and the women have dreadfully shrill voices.<br>  <br>  Arabic is a Semitic language, Farsi is an Indo-European language, the two are no more related than English and Hebrew.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	Farsi cause I can speak and understand a little.

Of course and whats worse since I live in a Moroccan/ North african Community mostly at my Masjid, most people will instantly switch between Arabic/French/ and english, lol I only got a C in standard french I'm doomed. hehe<br>  <br>  Actually farsi is a mix, I think, and i believe Arabic is a semetic language just as Hebrew is,hold on a sec let me check, It's a central semetic language kind of related to Aramaic.|`|56146831de8554dae4dcf87338fa89e5aa	A) Although Arabic is the most accurate language itself but I do choose the Persian language since Persia is the cradle of the most prominent muslim thinkers ever ; Like Molana,Sa'di,Attar etc. btw I know Arabic as my second language.<br>  <br>  B) Lebanese Accent sounds lovely.<br>  <br>  C) No, they just Borrow some particular words from each other and it's common between languages. We can also find some Persian words in Holy Koran : "Estabragh" , "Barzakh" , "Borhan" etc. That's why some people accused The prophet(pbuh) of getting the Koran verses from Salman Farsi and you know Koran answers them in Surah "Nahl:103".<br>  <br>  It is also good to know the earliest grammarian of the Arabic language was a Persian linguist , known as "Sibawayh" . As Wikipedia confirms , his phonetic description of Arabic is one of the most precise ever made; He greatly helped to spread the Arabic language in the Middle East. <br>  Miss "Ranoush", do you mind if I rectify your opinion of Persian?  Persian language is much older to be mixed of any younger language; Some particular Arabic words you might have seen in Persian is owing to the religion of the nation; you know the vast majority of Persians are muslims.<br>  <br>  I apologize if it's too long but hope you read. <br>  Stay safe.|`|BOxqd0lXaa	A) Farsi :D<br>  I'm half Iranian, so I'm biased.<br>  BUT I also dearly love the Arabic language, I'm starting to learn it.

The Arabic that Prophet Muhammad spoke was different from the Arabic that we speak. This means that Arabic changed slightly and could have had a beginning, like all religions...<br>  <br>  Through Linguistic research we can trace Arabic back to a language spoken by the people of Sham, who are also decendants of many Arabs. <br>  <br>  Remember nowhere in the Quran does it say that Arabic is by any means superior to any other language. That is wrongfully perceived by muslim cultures as the best of Languages, even though God did not mention it. God gave equal opportunity to everyone. Arabic is indeed a beautiful language but to say that it is better than all languages just because the Quran is written in it is semi-blasphemous.<br>  <br>  Dont forget the fact that God sent messengers to EVERY nation and race in the past. Moses (pbuh) did not speak Arabic to the Jews when he gave God's message to the Judean tribes, neither did Jesus (pbuh) speak Aramaic to the Anatolian people to whom he preached.<br>  <br>  I urge this "preference" of languages to be only at a playful level.<br>  <br>  And BTW to everyone who thinks Farsi is a mix of many languages, no its not. Persian Grammar has nothing in common with non Indo European languages. A few loan words does not make a language a mix of others.<br>  <br>  @Blazer, 60% of Farsi came from Arabic language? Hardly 10% in my book. Again Farsi is an Aryan language... not a semitic one|`|YU5ke1fOaa	Arabic, yemeni <br>  <br>  <br>  60% of persian language came from arabic.|`|RVWyPicKaa	Boy don't I love the egyptian accent?! <br>  <br>  i just love the g's.|`|4aveC2aaaa	a- arabic<br>  <br>  b- my accent, the palestinian. i also love the syrian accent<br>  <br>  c- not sure

QUwkeeyAaa	"I believe the earth is billions and billions of years old as is recorded in the original Torah."<br>  <br>  I would be interested to see where that is, can you point me towards it? As for the rest of your questions, I feel no shame in saying I don't know. All I know is that it would have been an exceedingly simple life form, lungs and gills would be a later development, and sexual reproduction didn't happen until way later.<br>  <br>  And yes, there are many unknowns that remain. However, you make some false statements.<br>  <br>  "an abundance of transitional fossil records to show, exactly the transition from one cell creature to man"<br>  <br>  Not every creature fossilizes. It is a big planet. You can't expect to dig down somewhere and find a neat layer of stacked bones. and ps. bones were a later stage in evolution, The first creatures would definitely not have a bone structure. Vertebrates took a while to take the stage.<br>  <br>  About brains, it is not the size that matters. We know where our brains differ from other animals. I'm too lazy to dig out the link right now.<br>  <br>  Finally, if we can explain 95% of the universe both in spatial and temporal terms as a function of natural processes, is it more natural to assume a supernatural being did the rest, or that natural processes (even if not currently known or understood) is responsible for the rest?|`|825953318303d03d2a0b5c5c512b8f40aa	It was a cell that divided.  Of no sex.|`|AA11254914	It was small enough that it got all the oxygen it required through simple diffusion though its surface membranes. The largest you can get with this type of gas exchange is a few centimeters long and very thin, some sea worms use this method of gas exchange.<br>  <br>  Meiosis is the method by which gametes are produced in sexually reproducing organisms, it involves halving the amount of chromosones in a normal cell to produce a gamete which fuses with another game to create a zygote with the fully number of chromosones. It is impossible for an organism to reproduce by meiosis alone. The first organisms reproduced by mitosis, which is simply cell division; the DNA is replicated, then segregated, then cytokensis takes place and one cell splits into two. Later, organisms reproduced asexually, and finally sexually when the exchange in genetic information brought around more variation and more opportunity to create offspring with an advantage. It also reduced the degeneration of DNA [which is why inbreeding in humans is illegal and leads to severe problems].<br>  <br>  Fossils can occur only in very specific conditions where by organic matter is replaced with minerals. The method of fossilasation involves a quick burial in mud or sand and a lot of pressure. The fact that soft tissues do not fossilise very easily, if at all, means that the only fossil records we have are of those animals with bones, whereas even today there are many animals that do not have bones [sea sponges, jelly fish, slugs, worms].<br>  <br>  Regards intelligence the key seems to be brain size to body size ratio. Besides, in humans there is an amount of variation in cranium capacity but the correlation to intelligence is non-existant. In a few million years I expect some animals will have developed the level of reasoning we have now, and humans will be even more intelligent than we are today. We just happened to get the cleverest the quickest. Some primates are extremely intelligent and many show signs of empathy [ability to lie], self awareness [recognition of themselves in the mirror], the foundations of logic [if you hide food under a cup they will look for it there, most animals would think it just didnt exist anymore]. They are also able to change their behaviour very rapidly in order to meet new circumstances. This example shows how intelligent some of them are:<br>  <br>  "Macaques live all over Japan. Take Koshima- an offshore island, they're isolated and so are different than the mainland macaques. Scientists wanted to study them. To entice them out, the scientists began offering them sweet potatoes. One female began to take them to a pool and wash them. Then her close family began doing it, and now all the monkeys on the island wash their sweet potatoes. Then they all began to wash them in the sea, even when they were already clean. Only the old didn't do this new behavior; The young learned from their mothers while clinging to their backs, but the old didn't pick it up. The scientists really wanted to study the monkeys, but every time they gave them sweet potatoes, the monkeys ran off to wash them. So, they offered rice, figuring the monkeys would take a while to pick it up off the sand, but the same girl grabbed big handfuls of rice and sand and took it down to the water. When she threw it in the water, the rice floated and the sand sank, and she skimmed the rice off the surface of the water. Soon all the other ones began to do it too. Although usually a term reserved for human societies, this is a shared culture. "<br>  <br>  Ice ages have been known about for a considerably long time now, and while it is impressive that its in the Torah, I imagine there is even more things that aren't, and many things that the in the Torah that aren't true.|`|DnWNwjhMaa	You again...You’re like a wood cutter who searches the forest for fallen trees. You’re alone so even if you could bring down a standing tree, it would be far too much work to chop it up and bring it home. So instead, you concentrate on fallen trees; the ones standing proud and erect simply don’t catch your attention. Fallen trees are quite rare in a forest of large trees but after much painstaking search, you find the remains of an ancient one near the edge and you dance and caper about thinking that because you’ve found one measly fallen tree, the rest will fall. This belief makes you happy and makes you feel superior to the people who come to admire the large trees and you try to convince them of your belief that because one old tree fell some time ago, all the other trees will fall too. The people just shake their heads and look at you with a mixture of pity and contempt.|`|ae84e79b36a331301de9b2c763e823a2aa	No speculation?

5f9b5c0ebaeb020369c8bd71ab8196ddaa	Are you actually serious?  "The Fall" is a figurative expression.  It does not refer to anyone actually falling down, as a result of a banana peel or anything else, tho I am told that a "serpent" caused the first man and woman to fall into "sin", as a result of partaking of "forbidden fruit".  I doubt that it was a banana tho.  I have heard that it was a pomegranate.  Most think it was an apple.  I heard that some believe that it was a fig.  I think it was probably equally figurative, along with the serpent, etc.|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	Careful.

Jesús nos lo demuestra con su ejemplo de entrega y aceptación.Nadie puede no sufrir jamás, y el sufrimiento bien llevado,entregado a Dios de corazón, nos hara más maduros en todo sentido.El Espiritu Santo, consolador,nos ayuda a sobrellevar el sufrimiento con alegría, porque su presencia le da sentido a todo, hasta al mismo dolor angustias, enfermedades, persecuciones, etc.Y si sufrimos por algo, es muchas veces una ayuda haber experimentado eso para no volver a caer en lo mismo.|`|d5ec9153972f31d5751bf6129a83dda0aa	En Salmo 82: 1 y 2 dice que Dios está en la “reunión” de los “dioses”, y en medio de ellos “JUZGA”. Cuando Dios habla de una REUNIóN es aquí la tierra, porque habla de los IMPíOS (verso 2). Además, los dioses somos nosotros (versos 6 y 8). Somos hijos del Altísimo. Si usted es un hijo de Dios, es un dios; que es nuestra verdadera identidad espiritual.<br>  Dios se levantaría en medio de nosotros y JUZGARíA la tierra (verso 8), ya que ese es un RUEGO de los elegidos. Hasta ahora, nos han JUZGADO las religiones. Pero ya Dios se levantó, y si Dios se levantó, ?cuál es ese JUICIO? Según Romanos 2: 16, Pablo, dice que un DíA, Dios (el otro) juzgaría, haciendo eco a lo dicho por el Salmo 82: 8. Pero, ?Quién está haciendo eso hoy con el evangelio de Pablo? Solo Jesucristo hombre, Apóstol José Luis De Jesús Miranda, El Anticristo, el OTRO. <br>  No se juzga con los escritos de los apóstoles judíos (la circuncisión) ya que es un juicio incorrecto, sino con el evangelio de Pablo (la incircuncisión), esa es la clave.<br>  Jesucristo hombre JUZGARíA con estas claves: Primero, edificaría encima del fundamento de Pablo (1a a los Corintios 3: 10). Algo que los apóstoles no hicieron, al contrario, trataron de invalidar sus cartas. Pero el fundamento de Pablo nos presenta sin pecado (Hebreos 9: 26), perfectos para siempre (Hebreos 10: 14), completos (Colosenses 2: 10), sin diablo (Hebreos 2: 14)…<br>  Romanos 14: 9- 12, dice que el que juzgaría, murió, resucitó, y volvió a vivir para ser Se?or de vivos y de muertos. Todos compareceremos ante el tribunal de Cristo, ya que ante él se doblará toda rodilla y le confesará.<br>  2a a los Corintios 3: 13 al 18 dice que el primer paso para juzgar la tierra, es que Dios (Cristo) nos quitaría el VELO (Jesús de Nazaret). Moisés, es también un velo, que se mezcla con el VELO Jesús de Nazaret, ya que él le puso fin a la LEY.  Por eso Jesús no fue cristiano. Hay que quitarle los ojos a la iglesia de Jesús en la carne porque él no vendrá más (Juan 16: 10). Cuando usted se convierte al Se?or, el velo se quitará, ya que él es el Espíritu (segunda a los Corintios 3: 16- 18).<br>   Entendemos que Moisés, “el dios de este siglo”, cegó el entendimiento (2a a los Corintios 4: 4, 5). Pero llegará un día que toda rodilla de doblará y confesará al Se?or (Isaías 45: 22 y 23).|`|d8XvfEwQaa	NO ES NI LO UNO NI LO OTRO<br>  <br>  NO ES JUSTO EL SUFRIMIENTO<br>  <br>  ES PARTE DE éSTA VIDA PERO NO ES POR VOLUNTAD DE DIOS, EL SURIMIENTO ES CONSECUENCIA DE LA DESOBEDIENCIA A SUS JUSTAS LEYES<br>  <br>  PODEMOS AGUANTAR EL SUFRIMIENTO PERO NUNCA ACEPTARLO, PRECISAMENTE POR QUE NO ES JUSTO<br>  <br>  PERO NO DESESPERES PRONTO MUY PRONTO ,DIOS ACABARA CON EL SUFRIMIENTO PARA SIEMPRE, LAS COSAS ANTERIORES SERáN COSAS DEL PASADO<br>  <br>  DIOS ES UN DIOS DE JUSTICIA|`|k81sdsGVaa	PURIFICASION!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  en esta vida va a ver dolor, trizteza, alegria...de todo....<br>  realmente dezcansaremos en la vida eterna, cuando estemos en la Presencia de Dios<br>  Jesus sufrio porq nosotros no??|`|naUxp9SWaa	el dolor es inevitable, el sufrimiento es opcional.|`|rbKSM4aMaa	no es un castigo pero si te purifica en el espiritu pues te hace mas fuerte, nada de lo que nos pase es un castigo de Dios|`|vSgC7LgKaa	Aprendizaje.

A lot of Americans share the same culture even though they are from different races|`|iFRTWg9Jaa	Absolutely they're different.. Your question is a bit confusing to because in your question you ask if there is a difference between racism and culture, but in your explanation, you tend to lean toward the idea of a difference between RACE (not racism) and culture.<br>  <br>  Racism itself is a way of belief I think.. It's when someone believes that an entire group is the same just because they are of the same race, etc.. <br>  <br>  Race is based on where you and your ancestors are from, etc.. Your skin color, etc comes into all this of course.<br>  <br>  Culture is based on upbringing... You can be one color and have a totally different upbringing of others of your same color too.. It's how you're brought up.. Things you're taught.. Things you do.. Foods you eat, etc.. <br>  <br>  So, as you can see culture is totally different from those other two things.. There is nothing the same about them.. <br>  <br>  The only way that I can see people comparing them at all is if people suggest that "in general" people of a certain group may have a similar culture.. but then.. once in the Western World.. that tends to change a lot anyway.. Especially in places like the USA.. because people tend to become "Americanized" .. Their cultures lean more towards American things, etc.. <br>  <br>  Just thoughts :)

He may not agree with what they do, but I believe he still loved those that sinned.  I could be wrong, but I thought the bible said that he walked among the sinners, etc.. He didn't walk around telling them that they were 'scum' and stuff like that.  He treated sinners as people that he felt were doing something wrong, but were able to be loved and forgiven.<br>  <br>  Besides.. it's not our place to decide who is doing right and wrong, it's Gods.<br>  <br>  God may not agree with homosexuality, but I don't think he would agree with being rude and nasty to those that are homosexual either.<br>  <br>  As some people say, "Love the sinner, hate the sin"..

Anyway, sinners will live as they do, but the love for them should not change - Jesus demonstrated this with people He associated with.<br>  <br>  Change the name?  Well, as one comedian so well put it, "They got ya fooled at the country clubs - pig slop is still pig slop whether it's on a paper plate or a silver platter".  You can rename it, repaint it or rearrange it - the act, lifestyle or choice remains the same.  But, God's love never changes and we should represent Him.<br>  <br>  Shame on any Christian who shows hatred toward anyone.
LVkbcQR9aa	Bonsoir Bleu_lagon,<br>  <br>  Le Christ avait une mission à accomplir, mission que son Père lui avait confié. Tout comme un fils obéissant à son père, Jésus a obéit à Dieu.<br>  <br>   “Le Fils ne peut rien faire de sa propre initiative, mais il ne fait que ce qu’il voit faire au Père. Car tout ce que fait Celui-ci, cela le Fils aussi le fait pareillement.” (Jean 5:19, 30; 7:28; 8:28, 42). <br>  <br>  “Ainsi fit-il, exactement”, déclarant: “Je suis descendu du ciel pour faire, non pas ma volonté, mais la volonté de celui qui m’a envoyé.” (Jean 6:38).<br>  <br>  Les pensées de Jésus étaient continuellement dirigées vers l’accomplissement de la volonté de Dieu. Grace à son excellente connaissance des écritures, il était en mesure de répondre en les citant (Matthieu 4:1-11; 12:24-31).<br>  <br>  “Afin que le monde sache que j’aime le Père, oui, comme le Père m’a donné ordre de le faire, ainsi je fais.” (Jean 14:31). <br>  <br>  Voici quelques expressions utilisées par Jésus pour montrer qu'il obéissait à Dieu par Amour.<br>  <br>  N'aurait-il pas été narcissique, s'il était Dieu, de s'obéir à lui-même par amour de lui-même ?|`|7cc4cf368edc21880b7b8aaa2bbfa3c3aa	il n'y as pas de trinité, dans ce verset on voit bien que Jésus a d? apprendre l'obéissance par le moyen de la souffrance c'est-à-dire qu'en offrant sa vie parfaite sur la terre, il a d? souffrir aux mains d'être qui sont des humains imparfaits. Par exemple, il a d? (être très humble pour répondre a ses insultes en toute humilité) et tout les autres qualités qui avait de toute fa?on. Il a été tout a fait éprouvé; il a subit toute sorte d'opposition, de persécution et pour finir une mort ignominieuse.|`|a40pC6kHaa	Désolée mais cette histoire de trinité ne me rentre pas dans la tête! J'adore un seul Dieu, le seul l'unique, notre créateur et protecteur, Salut.|`|ktCErqSkaa	je me demande comment peut on croire a ces aneries de trinité?|`|seWZxCFSaa	L'obéissance est souvent mal comprise, en aucun cas elle est aveugle. C'est une union de volonté. Qu'il y est deux, trois, dix; un milliard de personnes le principe est le même. On conna?t la volonté d'une personne(ou d'un groupe de personnes), on la reconna?t comme bonne(il faut exercer son intelligence) et on est d'accord. De ce fait on va agir en conséquence, mais en fonction de ce que l'on est soi même, avec son caractère et, surprenant, avec une liberté totale. L'obéissance comprise comme cela est une expression de l'amour.|`|ZhH1bQ22aa	Dieu n'a rien à prendre mais si le fils a appris l'obeissance c'est qu'il possédait en lui cela depuis et cela est un reflexe pour lui donc je voudraos te dire que Jesus qui est aussi Dieu connaissait sa mission avant de venir sur terre donc in est appellé à obéir à Dieu car dans les cieuxau moment où la voix fut entendre dans les cieux de savoir qui je vais envoyer ainsi Jésus qui était en cemoment au ciel où il y avait le silence absolu s'est dit me voici seigneur send me et tout ceci dans l'obéissance.|`|bd3e3e47b8caf155dd81762e84c2588caa	Enfin une vraie question sur la religion ! <br>  Il ne faut pas oublier que selon la foi des chrétiens, le Christ est vrai Dieu et vrai homme, sans séparation ni confusion des natures.<br>  Du point de vue de la nature divine, le Christ ne peut rien apprendre, car il est déjà parfait comme Dieu.<br>  Du point de vue de la nature humaine, le Christ a choisi de se faire homme en toutes choses, excepté le péché. Il a donc voulu apprendre... il aurait pu savoir tout dès le commencement de sa vie humaine, mais il a choisit de ne pas tout savoir, et d'apprendre petit à petit, pour faire l'expérience intégrale de la nature humaine. Son pouvoir divin peut aller jusque là, car rien n'est impossible à Dieu. C'est ce qu'on appelle effectivement le mystère de la Kénose.|`|j6qsQzJHaa	à coups de ceinturon !!!|`|kAxe8WLyaa	C'est le mouvement de la Kénose, le dépouillement du Christ.<br>  <br>  Pour la théologie catholique et à partir des Ecritures, le Fils s'est dépouillé de tous les attributs divins qui l'empêchaient d'être pleinement homme.<br>  <br>  C'est la condition de l'incarnation complète du Christ : il n'a pas fait semblant. Il est vraiment mort.<br>  <br>  L'autorité suprême de Dieu est une des choses qu'il a lachée. Il est entré dans l'obéissance amoureuse à Dieu, la soumission filiale, qui est dans la nature humaine.<br>  <br>  Il a laché la souveraineté, l'autorité, pour rejoindre les hommes,en s'en remettant entièrement à son Père, pour ramener chacun de nous dans l'amour de Dieu.<br>  <br>  C'est dans cet abandon, ce lachage, qu'il devient vraiment le Sauveur et qu'il a la victoire sur la mort et la péché.<br>  <br>  On peut complèter ta citation d'Hébreux par l'hymne des Philippiens (2; 6-11), un des textes fondateurs pour ce mouvement de kénose.<br>  <br>  " [..] lui qui est de condition divine<br>  n' a pas considéré comme une proie à saisir d'être l'égal de Dieu<br>  <br>  Mais il s'est dépouillé,<br>  prenant la condition du Serviteur<br>  devenu semblable aux hommes,<br>  reconnu à son aspect comme un homme <br>  <br>  il s'est abaissé,<br>  devenant obéissant jusqu'à la mort,<br>  à la mort sur une croix.<br>  <br>  C'est pourquoi Dieu l'a souverainement élevé<br>  et lui a conféré le Nom qui est au-dessus de tout nom,<br>  afin qu'au nom de Jésus tout genou fléchisse,<br>  dans les cieux, sur la terre et sous la terre,<br>  et que toute langue confesse que le Seigneur, <br>  c'est Jésus-Christ, à la gloire de Dieu le Père".<br>  <br>  Cordialement,<br>  <br>  Baran<br>  <br>  PS Décidemment, y a pas pire sourd que celui qui ne veut pas entendre ! ;)) Tu me renvoies ta question comme si tu n'avais pas lu la réponse. Encore alors, au cas où : le Fils de Dieu est accompli par son Incarnation. Il est entré dans l'histoire, il a sauvé l'humanité par sa mort. Autant de choses qui n'étaient pas accomplies avant sa venue dans notre chair.<br>  <br>  Ce qui défrise beaucoup de gens, c'est que ce soit dans cet abaissement du Fils en Jésus que cette gloire na?t. C'est insupportable de voir que la faiblesse et la mort peuvent mener à la vie, d'accepter dans notre foi et dans notre vie, cette puissance de la résurrection. <br>  <br>  L'amour de la Trinité s'est mis en action dans l'incarnation du Christ, de manière encore plus forte que lors de la création du monde. Le Christ a abandonné, abandonné (tu comprends?) toute sa puissance, son rang, c'est le sens de l'hymne de Philippiens. <br>  <br>  Et c'est pour cet abandon, cette perte, qu'il a été élevé dans sa Résurrection plus haut que tout, lui avait déchu du rang de Fils de Dieu à la dernière place ! Parce que l'amour qui l'a fait choisir cet abandon est la nature même de Dieu, et la puissance n'en est qu'un attribut.<br>  <br>  Que l'Esprit nous éclaire, que la Parole nous guide !|`|ql9xXcfAaa	Bonsoir Bleu Blagon<br>  <br>  considérons les déclarations inspirées de l’ap?tre des nations rapportées dans Hébreux 5:8, 9, nous remarquerons qu’il utilise des expressions qui, à première vue, paraissent étranges et difficiles à comprendre. Puisque Jésus était le Fils parfait de Dieu, envoyé des cieux, “loyal, innocent, sans souillure, séparé des pécheurs”, comment peut-on dire qu’“il a appris l’obéissance par les choses qu’il a souffertes” et qu’il a été “rendu parfait”?? (Héb. 7:26.) Pourquoi cela était-il nécessaire dans son cas?? N’était-il pas toujours obéissant et parfait?? Pour nous aider à acquérir le point de vue exact et une bonne intelligence de ces questions importantes, nous considérerons l’ensemble du sujet pour ainsi dire à travers les yeux de Paul en nous rappelant qu’il fut particulièrement béni par l’esprit de Jéhovah.<br>  <br>  Sa fidélité jusqu’à la mort a exalté le nom de Jéhovah. Elle a également permis à Jésus d’offrir la valeur de sa vie humaine parfaite en ran?on pour l’humanité, donnant ainsi à ceux qui exercent la foi en lui la perspective de la vie éternelle (Jean 3:16). Parce qu’il est resté fidèle dans l’épreuve, il est maintenant notre Grand Prêtre et notre Roi intronisé. —?Hébreux 7:26-28?; 12:2.
oAs0SDpmaa	Thanks for clearing that up I was really confused.|`|5308ab964dc585e2779ee9c4de92d391aa	Child of God and his dear Son Jesus the Christ and soon coming King<br>  The Kingdom of God is righteous, peace and joy in the Holy ghost|`|oXypvgK7aa	Great answer! What was the question?|`|4bf6fc8fb1cce3ab2092d525a3c2efbdaa	Overview of the Names of God in Scripture:<br>  <br>  (1) Elohim: The plural form of EL, meaning “strong one.” It is used of false gods, but when used of the true God, it is a plural of majesty and intimates the trinity. It is especially used of God’s sovereignty, creative work, mighty work for Israel and in relation to His sovereignty (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 32:27; Gen. 1:1; Isa. 45:18; Deut. 5:23; 8:15; Ps. 68:7).<br>  <br>  Compounds of El:<br>  <br>  El Shaddai: “God Almighty.” The derivation is uncertain. Some think it stresses God’s loving supply and comfort; others His power as the Almighty one standing on a mountain and who corrects and chastens (Gen. 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; Ex. 6:31; Ps. 91:1, 2). <br>  <br>  El Elyon: “The Most High God.” Stresses God’s strength, sovereignty, and supremacy (Gen. 14:19; Ps. 9:2; Dan. 7:18, 22, 25). <br>  <br>  El Olam: “The Everlasting God.” Emphasizes God’s unchangeableness and is connected with His inexhaustibleness (Gen. 16:13).<br>   <br>  (2) Yahweh (YHWH): Comes from a verb which means “to exist, be.” This, plus its usage, shows that this name stresses God as the independent and self-existent God of revelation and redemption (Gen. 4:3; Ex. 6:3 (cf. 3:14); 3:12).<br>  <br>  Compounds of Yahweh: Strictly speaking, these compounds are designations or titles which reveal additional facts about God’s character.<br>  <br>  Yahweh Jireh (Yireh): “The Lord will provide.” Stresses God’s provision for His people (Gen. 22:14). <br>  <br>  Yahweh Nissi: “The Lord is my Banner.” Stresses that God is our rallying point and our means of victory; the one who fights for His people (Ex. 17:15). <br>  <br>  Yahweh Shalom: “The Lord is Peace.” Points to the Lord as the means of our peace and rest (Jud. 6:24). <br>  <br>  Yahweh Sabbaoth: “The Lord of Hosts.” A military figure portraying the Lord as the commander of the armies of heaven (1 Sam. 1:3; 17:45). <br>  <br>  Yahweh Maccaddeshcem: “The Lord your Sanctifier.” Portrays the Lord as our means of sanctification or as the one who sets believers apart for His purposes (Ex. 31:13). <br>  Yahweh Ro’i: “The Lord my Shepherd.” Portrays the Lord as the Shepherd who cares for His people as a shepherd cares for the sheep of his pasture (Ps. 23:1). <br>  <br>  Yahweh Tsidkenu: “The Lord our Righteousness.” Portrays the Lord as the means of our righteousness (Jer. 23:6). <br>  Yahweh Shammah: “The Lord is there.” Portrays the Lord’s personal presence in the millennial kingdom (Ezek. 48:35). <br>  Yahweh Elohim Israel: “The Lord, the God of Israel.” Identifies Yahweh as the God of Israel in contrast to the false gods of the nations (Jud. 5:3.; Isa. 17:6). <br>  <br>  (3) Adonai: Like Elohim, this too is a plural of majesty. The singular form means “master, owner.” Stresses man’s relationship to God as his master, authority, and provider (Gen. 18:2; 40:1; 1 Sam. 1:15; Ex. 21:1-6; Josh. 5:14).<br>  <br>  (4) Theos: Greek word translated “God.” Primary name for God used in the New Testament. Its use teaches: (1) He is the only true God (Matt. 23:9; Rom. 3:30); (2) He is unique (1 Tim. 1:17; John 17:3; Rev. 15:4; 16:27); (3) He is transcendent (Acts 17:24; Heb. 3:4; Rev. 10:6); (4) He is the Savior (John 3:16; 1 Tim. 1:1; 2:3; 4:10). This name is used of Christ as God in John 1:1, 18; 20:28; 1 John 5:20; Tit. 2:13; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:8; 2 Pet. 1:1.<br>  <br>  (5) Kurios: Greek word translated “Lord.” Stresses authority and supremacy. While it can mean sir (John 4:11), owner (Luke 19:33), master (Col. 3:22), or even refer to idols (1 Cor. 8:5) or husbands (1 Pet. 3:6), it is used mostly as the equivalent of Yahweh of the Old Testament. It too is used of Jesus Christ meaning (1) Rabbi or Sir (Matt. 8:6); (2) God or Deity (John 20:28; Acts 2:36; Rom. 10:9; Phil. 2:11).<br>  <br>  (6) Despotes: Greek word translated “Master.” Carries the idea of ownership while kurios stressed supreme authority (Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev. 6:10; 2 Pet. 2:1; Jude 4).<br>  <br>  (7) Father: A distinctive New Testament revelation is that through faith in Christ, God becomes our personal Father. Father is used of God in the Old Testament only 15 times while it is used of God 245 times in the New Testament. As a name of God, it stresses God’s loving care, provision, discipline, and the way we are to address God in prayer (Matt. 7:11; Jam. 1:17; Heb. 12:5-11; John 15:16; 16:23; Eph. 2:18; 3:15; 1 Thess. 3:11).<br>  <br>  Sometimes we humans make things more complicated than they really are.  Father God only wants a relationship with us - father/child relationship.  We can either accept it or deny it. <br>  <br>  The God who is powerful enough to use human writers for the Bible is the same God who is powerful enough to work through translators to insure that what we read is accurate enough for us to find Him.  If He didn't do that then the sacrifice of His son Jesus Christ on the cross would have been in vain.<br>  <br>  God is my Daddy.  I talk to Him the same way I talk to my earthly Father.  He hears me & He answers my prayers.  That's good enough for me.|`|AA11984278	So what is your question?|`|AA12273565	We are all children of God . Children of God are the believers . They are obedient to God's command. We could loss that state of being children of God by alienating ourselves from HIM by chosing a sinful life.

DFVodnbRaa	They were probably giving tribute to pagan gods, which goes against Commandment #1: "I am the Lord your God, you shall not have other gods before me". And to answer your second question, that incense that is used during the mass is offered to God, and not some pagan deity, and the big ornate ball of incense is called a censer, sometimes called thurible, and think of fumigating the hall as a sort of blessing.|`|499d4d229a4bf3b0c9a7647292f5e613aa	Incense is made from dried dung.<br>  <br>  If you read about what God considers sweet-smelling, you'll find that it is praise and prayers of the saints, not incense.|`|AA10452279	Do you have a specific scripture?  I've seen many instances to incense in exodus but none of them were rebukes.<br>  <br>  The few references I did find God was angry about the burning of incense to other gods and also for their blasphemies and iniquities (I guess they were offering sacrifices/incense without a sincere heart).|`|uvKU4ol3aa	Because Orthodox are wrong. God does not want offerings or sacrifices. He doesn't need anything. He wants us to obey him! He is not pleased by rituals, or ceremonies. He is pleased when we do what he asks.|`|AA11077623	I think it refers to offerings made to idols...not specifically the incense itself, just that was the most common offering at the time.|`|ASYjwLbcaa	God wanted to "smell" incence that was pleasing.

Questo tipo di satanisti non adorano nessuna divinità e satana è usato solo come simbolo contrapposto alla visione cattolica dell'uomo. Per altri è una vera e propria religione in cui si accetta l'esistenza del diavolo biblico e lo si adora al posto di dio seguendo rituali e stili di vita in contrasto con gli insegnamenti cristiani. Altri adorano divinità pagane ma vengono definiti comunque satanisti. In ognuno di questi gruppi possono trovarsi persone che praticano rituali magici ma non è un imperativo. Ti lascio un link per maggiori approfondimenti.|`|VE4UTbzraa	sono persone che molto spesso nn hanno alcun problema al mondo, e dato che si annoiano con una vita senza problemi, vorrebbero complicare la propria esistenza e quella di chi gli sta intorno. <br>  p.s. lasciali li dove stanno, nn entrare in quel mondo .|`|DGGqvGXyaa	I Cattolici credono in Dio mentre i Satanisti credono in Satana o altre divinità malefiche.<br>  <br>  Loro vogliono ottenere soldi, potere, pregi e molte altre cose in questa vita perchè vogliono stare bene, ma non sanno che fare questo significa "vendere l'anima al diavolo".<br>  Non credo che ci siano correnti sataniste ma credo che fanno messe sataniche o di culto per diversi motivi: lussuria, superbia, accidia e molti altri...dipende dal loro obbiettivo.<br>  <br>  Poi ci sono dei personaggi pericolosi che praticano la magia nera e invocano demoni dall'aldilà. Loro vogliono il potere di Satana che lui dona ma che alla fine se lo riprende con interessi.<br>  <br>  Questo è quello che penso io poi cosa fanno realmente non lo so e spero di non saperlo mai.|`|barcnq3Vaa	Il satanismo è un culto che prevede l'adorazione di Satana (o di qualche altra entità superiore considerata negativamente dalle religioni tradizionali) o il ricorrere all'archetipo di Satana quale fonte di ispirazione per la vita dell'individuo. Comunemente viene associato a simboli come il pentacolo, il caprone e il numero 666 e ne esistono diversi movimenti e interpretazioni.<br>  <br>  Movimenti satanici<br>  <br>  Secondo alcuni, il satanismo non può considerarsi una religione in senso proprio poiché nella sua essenza non potrebbe esistere se non come negazione del cristianesimo. I tentativi di far risalire la sua esistenza all'adorazione di un dio caprino (Pan) e/o fallico si sono dimostrati storiograficamente inconsistenti. Il satanismo esiste quindi come "forza resistente" al cristianesimo e in sua funzione. In realtà la questione non è così semplice, dato che con questa etichetta vengono indicati movimenti molto eterogenei:<br>  <br>      * Satanismo "razionalista" - pur non credendo in alcuna divinità all'infuori dell'uomo, adotta il nome Satana in contrapposizione a un sistema millenario che ritengono oscurantista, e che sottometterebbe l'uomo togliendogli ogni valore.<br>      * Satanismo "occultista" o "tradizionalista" - si accettano gli assunti di base della Bibbia, ma ci si schiera "dall'altra parte". Nasce in occidente in età post-medioevale (XI - XVI secolo). Alcuni satanisti non approvano tale scelta, sottolineando come ?un individuo che crede nel Diavolo biblico, non dovrebbe essere identificato come Satanista, ma meglio come un "cattivo cristiano"?: ?si arriverebbe?, sostengono, ?al fanatismo da entrambe le parti?. Tra i rappresentanti si ricorda "Il Tempio di Set", fondato nel 1975 a San Francisco da Michael Aquino.<br>      * Satanismo "acido" - gruppi satanici che prediligono le azioni violente, l'uso di droga, le orge. Non possono essere definiti gruppi strutturati e organizzati. A questi gruppi si ricollegano attività di profanazione e rituali sacrificali e sono fortemente osteggiati da altri satanisti. Tra i rappresentanti può essere citato il gruppo "The Family" di Charles Manson.<br>      * Il Luciferismo - satanismo di orientamento manicheo. Venera Lucifero, ma non lo considera il principio del male, bensì il ribelle contro Dio creatore o un principio necessariamente complementare a Dio.<br>  <br>  Al giorno d'oggi vi sono diverse sette, diffuse in tutto l'occidente, che praticano questo culto. Negli Stati Uniti i satanisti hanno ottenuto che gli fosse riconosciuto lo status di religione e un cappellano nell'esercito.<br>  <br>  Il successo di questa pratica deriva forse anche dalla sua associazione a forme di protesta sociale e di liberazione sessuale (almeno per alcuni tipi di satanismo), in questo senso viene spesso citato come padre del Satanismo contemporaneo - secondo taluni travisando il suo insegnamento - Aleister Crowley, il quale assunse come motto la frase: ?Fai ciò che vuoi: sia questa tutta la legge?.<br>  <br>  Satanismo "ribelle":<br>  <br>  I membri di questo gruppo hanno accettato il dogma cristiano secondo cui Satana ed i satanisti sono intrinsecamente malvagi. Non stupisce quindi che i membri, da soli o radunati in piccoli gruppi, facciano parlare di sé nelle cronache per atti illegali più o meno gravi.<br>  <br>  Anche se molti "ribelli" sostengono di ispirarsi ai lavori di Anton Szandor LaVey, pochi conoscono a fondo questo autore, e la maggior parte di loro ha un'idea di Satana che deriva più da fantasie letterarie o da testi di critica rivolti contro le posizioni dei cristiani più osservanti. Principalmente la loro idea di Satana riflette una chiara matrice cristiana.<br>  <br>  Gli altri satanisti chiamano i membri di questo gruppo gli "adoratori del Diavolo" (in senso dispregiativo), la maggior parte dei moderni studiosi di satanismo concorda nel vedere in questi gruppi una minoranza di scarso rilievo.<br>  <br>  Satanismo "religioso":<br>  <br>  I membri di questa categoria credono nell'esistenza di una divinità personale, il Principe delle Tenebre, a cui rendono culto.<br>  <br>  Il gruppo più conosciuto è il "Tempio di Seth" (Temple of Seth) fondato da Michael Aquino ed altri membri della Chiesa di Satana (vedi oltre) dopo la loro fuoriuscita dalla Chiesa nel 1975. I membri del Tempio sostengono di adorare l'antico dio Egizio Seth.<br>  <br>  [modifica] Satanismo "filosofico" o "moderno"<br>  <br>  La più grande organizzazione di questo tipo, e quella dotata di maggior visibilità, è la Chiesa di Satana fondata da LaVey, che ha esposto la filosofia alla base del movimento nel suo The Satanic Bible ("La Bibbia satanica"). Dopo la morte di LaVey, il gruppo è andato incontro ad alcuni fermenti interni e varie riorganizzazioni.<br>  <br>  La designazione di satanisti "moderni" riservata a questo gruppo sottintende che il satanismo religioso risalga a tempi più antichi, ma c'è chi fa notare come il termine "Satanismo" fosse raramente usato da qualche gruppo prima della comparsa della Chiesa di Satana. Per questo motivo, i membri della Chiesa di Satana rivendicano per sé l'etichetta di "Satanisti", riferendosi agli altri gruppi come "pseudo-satanisti".<br>  <br>  Nonostante la maggioranza dei satanisti moderni considerino sé stessi dei filosofi, e molti si professino atei, alcuni studiosi, pur consci del fatto che i satanisti moderni non credano nell'esistenza di Satana in quanto essere personale, li classificano come satanisti religiosi per il fatto che praticano la magia (requisito sufficiente per catalogarli come "religiosi" secondo alcune definizioni).<br>  <br>  Esistono anche Satanisti che non si riuniscono in gruppi, non praticano la magia e vedono nei culti creatisi sulla scia di LaVey associazioni che travisano l'intento principale della filosofia Satanista.<br>  <br>  Costoro pensano che il cammino di perfezionamento personale sia una strada che debba essere percorsa in solitudine, alla ricerca continua di nuove esperienze e conoscenze che possano completare la propria esperienza di vita sul cammino della verità. Questi studiosi solitari credono che il fatto di riunire la propria filosofia in gruppi religiosi o associazioni simili che riconoscono una autorità come "capo spirituale" o "maestro" sia un grande errore. Significherebbe andare contro il principale concetto del Satanismo, cioè la ricerca della libertà individuale. Seguire un capo, per quanto illuminato possa essere, è contrario a questo importante precetto, anche se egli potrebbe essere stimato.<br>  <br>  Nei confronti del divino, una piccola parte di questo tipo di Satanisti si considera atea, anche se l'agnosticismo è la posizione più diffusa.<br>  <br>  Spesso i praticanti di questa versione di Satanismo scevra di componenti religiose e di rituali magici viene ignorata dalle statistiche e dagli studi degli esperti. Questo succede principalmente perché queste persone sono molto schive e temono di presentarsi come Satanisti per colpa dei pregiudizi della gente, che associa immediatamente tale definizione a "messe nere" e sette di carattere violento e antireligioso. Inoltre il rifiuto tassativo di riunirsi in gruppi fa ovviamente in modo che le loro credenze abbiano minore impatto e vengano considerate più delle bizzarrie che elementi di una solida filosofia moderna.<br>  <br>  Satanismo "tradizionale":<br>  <br>  I membri di questo gruppo sostengono che l'idea di satanismo vada molto al di là del semplice principio della gratificazione dei propri piaceri personali: il satanismo è un percorso arduo che richiede autodisciplina ed autocontrollo per raggiungere una saggezza universale. è una concezione prettamente pragmatica di satanismo, che pone l'enfasi sulla crescita dell'individuo che riesce ad attraversare reami oscuri e pericolosi con atti di forza, resistenza e a rischio della propria vita. Inoltre, il satanismo tradizionale cerca di indurre un cambiamento, se pur da un punto di vista satanico, nella società.<br>  <br>  La più grande organizzazione di questo tipo è l'Order of Nine Angels ("Ordine dei Nove Angeli").<br>  <br>  Altri gruppi:<br>  <br>  Presso alcune sette gnostiche il serpente viene elogiato come "portatore della conoscenza" (come accade per Satana, nella sua veste di Lucifero, il "portatore di luce"). Alcuni gnostici sostengono che il dio della Bibbia, da loro chiamato "il Demiurgo", sia in realtà Satana stesso. Ad alcuni dei primi gnostici vennero addossati ogni genere di atti criminali, ed essi furono accusati di propagandare ogni tipo di atto malvagio quale via di liberazione della sofferenza del mondo, ma questi resoconti sono poco attendibili dato che provengono soprattutto da autori impegnati nell'attaccare lo gnosticismo in quanto forma di eresia.<br>  <br>  Guarda qui per maggiori info: <a href="http://www.bambinidisatana.com/chi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bambinidisatana.com/chi.htm</a><br>  <br>  Io cmq ti sconsiglio di entrare in questi gruppi dopo fai come vuoi...|`|nXqfAofMaa	Sinceramente non sono informata su queste cose, allora tu ti chiederai ma perchè allora mi rispondi?? bene lo faccio perchè credo che queste cose è meglio lasciarle al loro posto, nel senso che in troppo interessamento e l'eventuale ricerca ti portano a voler provare ed ecco che quando meno te lo aspetti sei dentro!!!|`|viqFWweqaa	Mi fai pena!!!<br>  Spero che tu ti renda presto conto di quello che dici, prima che  tu lo faccia per davvero!!!<br>  Abbandona quest'idea ti può portare solo male e tanto dolore fisico e morale!!!<br>  Pensaci mille volte e non farlo mai....|`|5a3b34ea18a07d4fc0284bc4607fd24faa	alla fine sono una religione come le altre, se non facessero sacrifici umani, o altri reati non ci sarebbe nulla di cui accusarli legalmente.<br>  a me fanno abbastanza pena.|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	vorrei risponderti ma non so proprio dirtelo.

Non seulement, cela, en glissant, je tombe et mince une grosse merde de chien, j'en avais plein le dos en tombant.<br>  croyez moi, je suis repartie, chez moi, écoeurée, pour me nettoyer.<br>  et repartir au travail, évidemment j'ai été en retard de 2 heures.<br>  Et devinez, tous le monde au boulot, le savait déjà, un de mes collègues m'avait vu, marrant de me dire que l'on était le vendredi 13, je n'avais pas remarquée, il vaut mieux en rire.<br>  cela était la seule fois, alors de dire que cela porte malheur, je ne crois pas, juste une fatalité à une date.|`|7QDWXXbpaa	non|`|84f9f684ca57ea88af8d7bbc2d588f74aa	Du tout !<br>  <br>  Pas plus que je ne fuis les chats noirs, ramasse des trèfles à 4 feuilles ou jette du sel par dessus mon épaule.<br>  <br>  A :)|`|GOlc2GzQaa	ouicar j habite au13 et on peut pas dire que j ai de la chance|`|KiAfQyJIaa	la vrai question est croyez vous a l'arithmosophie? les chiffres influencent-ils notre destin.Le 13 porte chance  mais  en realite a chacun sont chiffres porte bonheur|`|b647Roleaa	pour moi non|`|fUEwzVk7aa	non je crois que tout porte "bonheur" ou "malheur"  du moment qu'on veut y croire !|`|fhCSpKHdaa	Ma petite nièce est née un vendredi 13 et tous va bien pour le moment! elle vas avoir bientot 5 ans et elle est toujours en vie et en pleine forme!!!|`|t7Yy8Wp4aa	Bonjour …<br>  <br>  Le chiffre 13 me laisse assez indifférent…<br>  Il y a eu des bons jours 13 dans ma vie…<br>  Il y a eu des jours 13 où j’aurais mieux fais de resté couché…<br>  <br>  Dans certains pays, les chambres 13 sont retenues longtemps à l’avance !!!!<br>  Dans d’autres, il n’y a pas de chambre 13…on passe du 12 au 14 !!!<br>  <br>  Bonne journée.|`|da3c1a3e6e6a6ffd29819b3832af687eaa	Comme dirait Kévin: "Ca m'fait rire!" Non je ne suis pas superstitieuse...|`|9501cfd81eb5152ada0a5b6dbeb90a8faa	pour les croyants s?rement !!!!!Dans la religion chrétienne, cette superstition vient du fait que Jésus et ses ap?tres étaient treize à table, et qu'il fut trahit par judas!!!! la superstition liée au vendredi 13 vient également du vendredi 13 octobre 1307. Ce jour-là, tous les templiers de France sont arrêtés, sur ordre de Philippe le Bel. D’après la légende, le grand ma?tre Jacques de Molay aurait proféré sur le bucher : "vous serez tous maudits, jusqu’à la treizième génération". Une succession de malheurs s’abattit ensuite sur la famille royale.<br>  Cette histoire fut popularisée par Maurice Druon dans son roman "Les Rois maudits"... pour moi le chiffre 13 n'est  qu'un chiffre ......|`|259bcb099a7fd7500a1e4cbe77a76136aa	Je n'y crois absolument pas. Bisous. :)|`|9gF0VZLDaa	le 13 ne porte pas malheur bien sur, pourkoi si ce vrai, alors les 12, 11 ou même 9 ne porteraient pas malheur. ce n'est juste qu'une tradition. mais libre a ki veut y croire. en tt cas moi je ne crois qu'a ce que je voit (mis a part, la religion ou je crois en un Dieu que je n'ai pas vu et l'histoire)|`|C2TQ4fSxaa	C'est une pure invention, je n'y croit pas aux sornettes !!!<br>  <br>  .|`|WQqtYb3Gaa	Si  vous croyez réellement que le chiffre 13 porte malheur, vous vous trompez .En effet, je suis né la journée du 13, et je suis porte bonheur pour beaucoup de gens.

Il y a presque autant de vendredi 13 dans une année que de vendredi 14 ou de vendredi 20 :)|`|QaBWEs9Naa	non, pas du tout !! C'est un jour comme un autre...et mon fils est né le 13 décembre, alors, c'était plut?t un beau jour non !!!<br>  Et puis, comme on dit : il ne faut pas être supersticieux, sinon, ?a porte malheur !!! lol|`|ZhH1bQ22aa	Non car ma foi que j'ai en Jésus n'a pas de barrière et rien ne peut l'arrêter.|`|aqyFTKvWaa	pour moi c'est une croyance idiote, je suis née un vendredi 13, et depuis 56 ans cela m'a plut?t porté chance!!!!!

C'est une illusion de liberté...<br>  <br>  Même chose pour le destin des autres. Si on intervient dans leur vie c'est qu'il était écrit qu'on devait intervenir...|`|Gq4C2HyQaa	Totalement, toute nos actions, nos choix vont influencer notre vie et celle des autres...|`|ZUmA6qq8aa	Je ne pense pas!|`|4v7mtgm6aa	L'homme n'a pas de destiné, les choses qui nous arrivent arrivent par hasard ou par la complicité des autres mais jamais parce que Dieu à décrété que tel homme est fondamentalement bon et que tous ce qu'il fera sera positif ou que tel homme réussira toutes les choses qu'il entreprend. Il faut assumer ce que l'on fait rien ne sert de dire " ah si cela m'arrive c'est parce que c'était ainsi" Non!|`|KqcGAiWNaa	biens?r que oui|`|SC02RnXCaa	Le destin conduit celui qui consent et tire celui qui résiste. "|`|UYprqICVaa	Absolument! Si t'es sincerement croyant et tu es convaincu de tes actions tu peux changer le cours des choses........  c'est juste mon modeste avis!|`|WwXFAwHhaa	oui ! le destin est tout tracé mais parfois faut savoir y mettre un bon gros coup de pouce !|`|ebIQJsHsaa	Un homme, je ne sais pas, mais une femme, c'est s?r.|`|n5AmZu2Vaa	L'homme digne de ce nom, ne doit pas croire au " destin " il doit au contraire essayer de diriger sa vie selon ses aspirations et ses ambitions... Bien sur, s'il peut aider les autres à diriger, ou a changer le cours de leur vie en bien il doit le faire.....  Mais n'est ce pas le destin qui lui fait faire tout cela ?|`|ygnKEPDuaa	d'une certaine fa?on oui si on peut dire quand on prends certaines décisions on change son destin pas toujours dans le bon sens et parfois on change celui des autres qui vivent à vos c?tés mais je ne sais pas si c'est le destin ou si c'est seulement la Vie qui change hélas pour moi j'ai changé mon destin et celui de mon compagnon pas forcément dans le bon sens, je devrais dire en ce qui concerne le mien j'ai fait une erreur me acculpa hélas.... et pour lui bonne chance et pardon...|`|r9g7Mbs9aa	Sincerement persone ne peut changer son propre destin et changer pour l'autre. C'est DIEU seul qui change le destin de l'homme.. Comme le dit la bible: l'homme propose mais DIEU dispose...|`|vW6adIzPaa	Celui qui croit au Fils a la vie éternelle; celui qui ne croit pas au Fils ne verra point la vie, mais la colère de Dieu demeure sur lui. <br>  Jean 3 : 36

Ma famille proche (parent et épouse) savent que je souhaite donner mes organes.<br>  Mes motivations sont que je ne vois pas pourquoi, alors que je serais mort c'est à dire plus rien, je ne ferais pas bénéficier quelqu'un de se qui pourrait encore servir sur moi.|`|8ELISIQFaa	Moi je l'ai ! Bien visible dans mon porte-feuilles à coté de ma carte de donneur de sang. <br>  Un mort n'etant pas très utile, autant servir à quelque chose. Et si ?a sert à sauver des vies, c'est encore mieux !|`|JSt2ZB2baa	Oui ca y'est cela fait qql années que je l'ai. et si je le fais c parceque je me dis qu'à ma mort mes organes ne me serviront a plus rien donc s'il sont encore en bon état pourquoi ne pas les donner pour permettre a qqn d'autre de vivre?|`|RvHE3X0Kaa	Oui, je l'ai depuis 1994. <br>  Ma motivation ? Je suis pour le recyclage (lol). <br>  Quand mes organes ne me serviront plus autant qu'ils profitent à quelqu'un. ;)|`|TxFBAkORaa	j'ai  la carte d'organes , j'ai eu des greffes de cornée et je suis très reconnaissante d'avoir re?u des cornées si on en aurais pas trouvé j'aurais perdu mes yeux|`|lk18V20Saa	moi je l'ai depuis 1998 et je ne me suis jamais poser de question s'il fallait la prendre ou pas<br>  une fois mort ?a me serviras plus ,<br>  autant en faire profiter une personne à qui cela est vital<br>  puis un peu de moi vivra encore malgré ma mort<br>  <br>  ma famille est bien sur informer de mon don|`|myiNwcwSaa	je l'ai depuis mes 6 ans, on regardait le téléthon avec mes parent et il y a eu une annonce pour demander sa carte, toute la famille l'a fait. <br>  <br>  Etant donné que ma soeur cadette s'est fait opréré du coeur, nous avons passé beaucoup de temps à l'h?pital. Ma soeur avait rencontré une fille de son age (6 ans à l'époque) qui était en attente d'un donneur pour un coeur. Même si j'étais petite, je me souviens que la famille de cette petite fille vivait uniquement au rythme des examens, des hospitalisations... Je me souviens également la joie lorsqu"ils ont appris qu'un coeur était pour elle. Sans le coeur de cette personne, la petite fille serait décédée peu de temps après.<br>  <br>  Voila pourquoi il est très important d'avoir sa carte et d'en parler à ses proches, on peut très bien avoir besoin d'organes au cours de sa vie alors il faut des donneurs.|`|sF9aIaveaa	Un chirurgien transplanteur m'a dit un jour que la carte de donneur d'organe n'avait rien d'officiel.<br>  En fait il s'agit juste d'un preuve de plus que la personne veut donner ses organes.<br>  Mais si la famille refuse il ne peuvent rien faire.<br>  <br>  La seul liste officiel c'est la liste des non donneurs d'organe.<br>  <br>  C'est pour cela qu'avoir la carte c'est bien, mais il faut surtout bien précisé à sa famille que l'on veut donner les organes.<br>  Ca facilitera la tache des chirurgiens.|`|oPMeW4lZaa	pourquoi ne pas la demander,il me semble que quand on est mort on a plus besoin de nos organe pourquoi pas sauver la vie d un autres seulement par principe de rester integre (les insecte vous mangerond de toute maniere)et puis l enfant de 6 ans ou ladulte de xans attend peut etre depuis 5 ans ou plus un reins ,un coeur ou des poumons donc allez signer

For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."<br>  <br>  It ought to go without saying that modern American "Christians" are about as far from anything envisioned by "Jesus" as you can get; but in this instance, it's ironic that they claim to be obsessed with "family values," when Jesus himself quite clearly insists (in the ordinary way of a Middle Eastern "holy man") that to follow him, one must renounce all such familial ties.<br>  <br>  Yet the Bible is in practice little more than an ink blot test, and "Christians" read whatever they want into it.  And since it's so diffuse and self-contradictory, it's always pretty simple to find a passage that endorses your mood of the moment - and to ignore the one that contradicts it!

1wfLZrTQaa	I'm an American college student and yes, it can get pretty insane here in terms of parties and stuff, but I thought Britain was a party country too so I wouldn't assume you'll get to party more here than there. It depends on what city and college you go to and of course how much $ you have. If you go to a high school than yep, you'll get a prom. But like everything here how much fun you have depends on how much $ you've got. For instance I live in Orlando which is where Disney and about 100 other crazy fun theme parks are, not to mention I'm only like an hour from some of the best beaches in America and my city has tons of clubs BUT with-out $ I can't enjoy any of it.|`|gshzCz0Xaa	America does seem  better im from london|`|0fQk2spXaa	Yep.  It's just like you see on TV.  We all go to the beach everyday.  At school, we party all day.  If we do go to work, we have sex with the pretty girls at the office.  <br>  It's really nice over here.|`|ugdutKAnaa	America is pretty cool. You have a lot of different cultures in one place. I was recently looking at apartments to rent in London, I would like to move there. Do you know anything about the Graphic Design market in London, or the job market period?|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	'American girls seem much more laid back and down to earth.' <br>  <br>  This actually made me laugh. <br>  <br>  College life in the USA is a popularity contest. Americans place far more emphasis on status and appearance then we do here in Blighty. <br>  <br>  It seems like you want to live in an episode of Happy Days. How detached from reality are you? <br>  <br>  You are in for a shock, my young naive friend...|`|ACQNe3Hfaa	We are definitely richer and bigger than Britain.  While the average American works to buy a 42-inch plasma TV, the average Brit works to buy a loaf of bread.  That says enough about our lifestyles.<br>  <br>  As far as American girls go, they're nothing special.  They're just like everybody else.|`|ZFqz2DPRaa	Out here in Cali, we keep it Gd up, an stay true to the game that is...being a playa.|`|7CwFZ9v6aa	American life is a lot like movies, maybe just less exaggerated, but it depends on where you are and who you mingle with. College life, in movies, is often depicted like one big party. But there are actually a lot of very studious groups in reality. Maybe depends what city you're in. The people I work with are typical Americans: fast food eating, overweight, sports buffs, obnoxious, ignorant, arrogant people. I myself, and the people I choose to spend my time with, are not like that at all. Being an American, I often feel very non-American. There are groups of people like me, but I'm the minority. If you think American girls are better than British ones, you're just succumbing to a stereotype. Girls are good in any country, depending on what groups you turn to. When I think of "American girls" I think of our stereotype here: boozing, pompous, popularity-contestants who don't know anything intellectual and who just want stuff to clutter their existence.

JEHOVá es el Creador y con todo derecho el Gobernante Soberano del universo. El nombre JEHOVá es la traducción del tetragrámaton hebreo ( JHVH o YHWH ) que significa "El causa que llegue a ser". <br>  <br>  En algunas Biblias se puede encontrar el nombre de de Dios  en textos tales como ( Salmo 82:19; Isaías 42:8; éxodo 6:3, 3:15; Salmo83:18) tambien se encuentran en muchos otros lugares. En muchos casos cuando no aparece en el texto mismo, lo mencionan en una nota al margen de esos textos o otros, solo por mencionar algunos ejemplos.<br>  En muchas traducciones de la Biblia los traductores han optado por no utilizar el nombre de Dios  por razones tales como: 1) la palabra "Jehová" no representa con exactitud ninguna forma del Nombre que se haya usado en hebreo 2) el uso de cualquier nombre propio para el Dios que es uno y único, como si hubiera otros dioses de los cuales él  tuviera que ser distinguido, fue descontinuado en el judaísmo antes de la era cristiana y  es enteramente inapropiado para la fe univeersal de la Iglesia Cristiana. ( Así, han confiado en su propio punto de vista en cuanto a los que es apropiado como la base para remover de la Santa Biblia  en nombre personal de Autor Divino de ella, cuyo nombre aparece en el hebreo original más a menudo  que cualquier otro nombre o cualquier título. Reconocen que siguen el ejemplo de los partidarios del judaísmo, de quienes Jesús dijo: "HAN INVALIDADO USTEDES LA PALABRA DE DIOS A CAUSA DE SU TRADICIóN". Mat.15:6.<br>  <br>  Puesto que el tetragrámaton todavía se escribía  en las copias de la Biblia griega que componía las Escrituras de la iglesia primitiva, es razonable creer que los escritores del Nuevo Testamento, al citar de la Escritura, conservaron el tetragrámaton en el texto bíblico. Pero cuando fue removido del Antiguo testamento,griego,  fue removido  también de las citas del Antiguo Testamento en el Nuevo Testamento. Así pues, para algún tiempo al principio del siglo segundo el uso de reemplazos ( sustitutivos  para el nombre de Dios ) tiene que haber desplazado al tetragrámaton en ambos testamentos.<br>  <br>  Muchos escriturarios favorecen la grafía "Yahweh", pero hay incertidumbre, y no existe acuerdo entre ellos. Por otro lado, "Jehová" es la forma del nombre que más rápidamente se reconoce, porque se ha usado en espa?ol por siglos, y cuando se escribe con "h" final, al igual que otras formas, conserva las cuatro consonantes de tetragrámaton hebreo.<br>  <br>  ?Tiene usted una relación íntima con alguien cuyo nombre personal desconozca? Para las personas que creen que Dios no tiene nombre, a menudo él es simplemente una fuerza impersonal, no una persona real, no alguien  a quien ellas conozcan y amen y a quien puedan hablar desde el corazón en oración. Si El es real para usted y reconoce y accepta que El existe, podrá entender y agradecer que Dios tenga un nombre, JEHOVá.|`|Lng4W0aXaa	TU DEJA QUE SIGAN CREYENDO EN CUENTOS, NO TE MOLESTAN EN NADA DEJALOS CON SUS COSAS <br>  <br>  TOLERANCIA|`|4M9bjeK4aa	?Y qué sentido tendría que estuviera tranquilito?<br>  Además, los hebreos (israelitas) habían sido escogidos para predicar y ser un ejemplo a las otras naciones.

Fueron perseguidos durante muchos a?os, hasta la llegada del Emperador Romano Constantino, cuya esposa había abrazado el cristianismo y entonces decidió oficializar la religión cristiana. Así nació la Iglesia Católica con sede en Roma. Al pueblo romano lo convencieron adoptando sus dioses en forma de santos, por eso en el nacimiento de esta nueva religión, comenzó la adoración de ídolos, que originalmente estaba prohibido para los cristianos (era la única forma de unificar la religión romana y la cristiana).|`|31150628de1eb58bbfa39d9b866db34baa	La Iglesia Católica fue fundada por el Espíritu Santo el día de pentecostes en el a?o 33 d.C. en la persona de San Pedro, a quien Cristo le había previamente encomendado la misión de dirigir y cuidar de su Iglesia.<br>  <br>  El día de Pentecostés del a?o 33 fue el día que por primera vez se manifestó un grupo seguidores de las ense?anzas de Cristo al mundo.  En esos días se hacían llamar "Seguidores del Camino".  Posteriormente, en Antioquía, empezaron a utilizar el término "Seguidores del Mesías/Cristo" es decir, Cristianos.<br>  <br>  En la Iglesia del siglo I, siempre estuvo presente la universalidad de la salvación, la necesidad de proclamar el Evangelio de Cristo a todas las naciones y a todas las creaturas.  Fue en comienzos del siglo II, cuando San Ignacio de Antioquía comenzó a utilizar el término Iglesia Católica, es decir, Iglesia Universal.<br>  <br>  Todos los apóstoles, discípulos, incluso los judíos y los paganos reconocieron a San Pedro como líder de los cristianos y por eso, después del incendio de Roma, San Pedro fue de los primeros en ser martirizado.  Si vas a estar en contra de un grupo, seguramente al primero que buscas es al líder.<br>  <br>  El Pontificado de San Pedro duró del a?o 33 al a?o 67, inmediatamente la comunidad, consiente de la necesidad de mantener un líder que los guiara y que contara con los carismas de San Pedro, escogieron como sucesor a San Lino de Toscana, desde entonces a la muerte del pontífice, el Espíritu Santo, por medio de la comunidad, de los obispos y actualmente por medio de los cardenales, elige a quien deberá ocupar el lugar de San Pedro.  Esta sucesión a sido ininterrumpida durante 2000 a?os.<br>  <br>  La sede de la Iglesia Católica es la ciudad del Vaticano, fundada sobre la colina del mismo nombre y en la cual fue crucificado y sepultado San Pedro.|`|81c2eb4412288b62d2a6dd68ca648a56aa	Supongo que tu pregunta se refiere a los inicios Historicos, no?, entonces así la voy a contestar. Historicamente hablando, es un error pensar que Jesús fundó la iglesia cátolica. Jesús creo una filosofía en donde imperaba el amor al projimo y nos mostraba una Dios misericordioso y amoroso que contrastaba mucho con el Dios enojado y vengativo de la época del antiguo testamento. El verdadero creador de la Fe cristiana (no catolica) fue Pablo, quien con sus interminables sermones y viajes la propagó en el mundo pagano y gentil (obviamente motivado por las ense?anzas de Jesus), algo que los apostoles no querian aceptar, porque según ellos, las ense?anzas de Jesús solo eran para los Judios y por ende para los circuncidados. Pablo pasó por alto todo esto y al final se salió con la suya. De acuerdo a muchos historiadores, la fe cristiana pudo haber exisitido aún sin Jesús, pero nunca sin Pablo, ya que para la época del mismo Jesús, existian algunas filosofías que en una forma u otra manejaban las mismas ideas de tolerancia y amor hacia el projimo e inclusive rechazaban la esclavitud como institución (algo impensable para la época)<br>  <br>  La religion catolica no nació en la epoca del emperador Tiberio, ni siquiera en la época de Nerón con todas las matanzas que realizó sobre los cristianos (no <br>  los catolicos) que aunque mucho lo afirmen, no fue por un asunto religioso (los romanos eran sumamente tolerantes con las religiones de otros) sino politico. Era tan simple como el hecho de que los Romanos no podían entender una religión que hablara de paz y amor y que prohibiera adorar a otro que no fuera su propio Dios (algo sumamente raro en esa época) y que por ende no aceptaran al Emperador Romano en turno como el supuesto Dios que era (idea heredara de Oriente desde los dias de Julio Cesar).<br>  <br>  La religión Catolica o fé catolica (es decir universal) nació en el Concilio de Nicea convocado por el emperador Constantino (quien, a diferencia de su madre, nunca aceptó la nueva religión hasta su muerte) debido a las numerosas discrepancias de creencias teologicas que habían surgido a traves de los a?os. Ahi fue cuando se adopotaron los canones, ritos y doctrinas de fe que rigen la actual Iglesia catolica, cuya cabeza principal, era el Patriarca (o papa) de Constantinopla y no el Papa (o patricarca) de Roma como la misma Iglesia catolica Romana nos ha hecho creer.<br>  <br>  Fue a raiz del celo que existia entre estos dos personajes y sus sucesores, el de Roma y Constantinopla, que despúes de varios siglos de pugnas y ayudado por la toma de la ciudad de Roma por los barbaros y por ende la caida del Imperio Romano de occidente, que ambas iglesias se separaron creandose en oriente la Iglesia Ortodoxa a la cual despúes se le llamó griega y en occidente, la Iglesia Catolica Romana quien por su influencia en los diferentes reinos de occidente como Italia, los francos (fundadores de Francia y Alemania) e inglaterra, fue la que prevaleció.

Sachant que notre santé et notre bonheur dépendent de notre condition spirituelle, il est logique que nous nous demandions?: ‘?Où trouver une direction spirituelle digne de confiance?? Nous trouverons celle-ci dans un livre La Bible, mais gra?e à notre foi & la connaissance de ce livre, nous entretiendrons notre spiritualité.

Como se ha comentado antes, no podemos dar por sentada su existencia, ya que si lo hiciéramos podríamos dar por sentada la existencia de un Dios, 2 Dioses, 3 Dioses, los duendes mágicos o las súper-moscas extraterrestres todos ellos sin ningún fundamento.<br>  <br>  Los creyentes han escogido como cierta una cosa (a Dios) de entre todas las cosas que podrían existir, pero que no han sido percibidas de ningún modo.<br>  <br>  De ahora en adelante, denominaremos SUPERCONJUNTO a "el conjunto de cosas que podrían existir pero que no han sido demostradas".<br>  Dentro del SUPERCONJUNTO están incluidos los 2 conjuntos siguientes: <br>  Cosas que no existen           (luego no se han demostrado) <br>  Cosas que existen (pero no se han demostrado) <br>  Las "cosas que no existen" es un conjunto infinito (creo que esto es evidente).<br>  Las "cosas que existen" es un conjunto finito (también evidente).<br>  Estos son dos axiomas sobre los que se edifica la argumentación. Si alguno no fuera cierto, el razonamiento perdería todo su fundamento.<br>  <br>  DESENLACE:<br>  Los creyentes han elegido el elemento "Dios" de entre todos los elementos del SUPERCONJUNTO, con la esperanza de que esté incluido dentro del subconjunto "cosas que existen" y por tanto fuera del subconjunto "cosas que no existen".<br>  Resumiendo, han escogido un elemento de un conjunto formado por 2 subconjuntos: uno finito y otro infinito.<br>  <br>  ?Qué probabilidades hay de que el elemento escogido esté dentro del subconjunto infinito? <br>  Según la teoría de probabilidades, es fácilmente demostrable que el elemento escogido pertenecerá al conjunto infinito con un 100% de probabilidad.<br>  <br>  Por tanto, existe un 0% de probabilidades de que "Dios" pertenezca al conjunto "cosas que existen". Es decir, una persona que afirma que "Dios existe", se equivoca con toda probabilidad.<br>  <br>  Matemáticamente, Dios no existe.<br>  <br>  Este ensayo no trata de demostrar la inexistencia de Dios, sino la inexistencia de cualquier cosa elegida de forma totalmente aleatoria, fruto "puro" de nuestra imaginación. Lo que demuestra es que al dar por existente algo, debe hacerse en base a algún indicio o prueba. De lo contrario se tratará de una elección al azar entre cosas existentes y cosas inexistentes, y, si la elección es totalmente aleatoria (y este es el 3er axioma), con toda seguridad pertenecerá al conjunto de cosas que no existen.<br>  El creyente negará (entre otras muchas cosas) la veracidad de este 3er axioma, afirmando que la elección del elemento Dios tiene algún fundamento. Desde el punto de vista del autor, no existe tal fundamento, es una elección totalmente arbitraria de un producto de la imaginación, y por tanto pertenece con toda probabilidad al "conjunto de las cosas que no existen".<br>  En todo caso, este artículo no debe interpretarse como una demostración pretenciosa de la inexistencia de Dios, sino como un artículo curioso que ayuda a ver el tema desde un punto de vista distinto y nuevo, que intenta trasladar la discusión sobre la existencia de Dios a la discusión sobre la veracidad de los axiomas. Si tales axiomas se consideran ciertos, el razonamiento es impecable.|`|3qKCVs5Oaa	que enredo!!!|`|55f48c77fcbd3a7d9750371b082ff627aa	Si.|`|SSlRnE6Laa	Es facil y dificil. <br>  Facil te digo que si existe porque creo en él <br>  Dificil porque al no verlo visto nunca de que fundamento me baso para decir que existe <br>  Es como los ovnis no creo en ellos porque no los he visto entonces Dios es lo mismo aunque si creo en él<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|f804bfb1511966ada814cdca105ee997aa	es una res′puesta facil decir  si <br>  pero es una pregunta dificil  llevarla acabo  y realmente creer en el y cumplir al pie de  la letra|`|naUxp9SWaa	si, y hay quienes lo confirmaran|`|qOIfGpFzaa	SI, aun sin entrar en el debate de si existe o no dios, es más facil, creer en una imagen suprema, todo poderosa. Es la respuesta a la pregunta del principio y del fin. Es la salida, màs rapido, es lo mas facil cuando no sabes porque existes, ni porque vives.<br>  <br>  Sip, creer en dios es la respuesta más facil para todas las preguntas.|`|BRVKaPAQaa	sería lo más fácil SI, ya que lo difícil es pensar que existe un dios y que deja que pasen todas las barbaridades que pasan el la Tierra. Personalmente no creo que existe nadie ahí arriba excepto algún extraterrestre lejano.|`|HXFFVyBlaa	Claro que si.<br>  <br>  Toma por ejemplo la creación del universo. Se supone que Dios lo creo "de la nada". Así, sin mas. ?Eso es una explicación?????. Si digo "la Gran Cafetera Cósmica creo el universo de la nada", esa es una explicación de la misma categoría.<br>  <br>  Otro ejemplo, la diversidad de las especies. Eso está perfectamente explicado por la Teoría de la Evolución. Pero la respuesta científica no es "la evolución lo hizo", sino que se plantean montones de mecanismos (mutación, cruce, deriva genética, mutaciones neutrales, genes, cromosomas, especiación por aislamiento, etc. etc.), es decir, se hace un análisis detallado. Frente a eso "Dios lo hizo" no es una explicación.<br>  <br>  Un ejemplo mas concreto: las ballenas tienen aletas, si, pero la estructura osea de la aleta consta de dedos. También, a diferencia de los peces,  las ballenas respiran aire. ?Y porqué?. Respuesta del creyente "Dios lo hizo". Respuesta científica: aunque la ballena vive en el mar como los peces, es un mamífero y procede de mamíferos terrestres, y por tanto tiene características comunes con ellos.<br>  <br>  Otro ejemplo: es posible inducir a las gallinas a que desarrollen dientes. Es decir, es posible activar ciertos genes de las gallinas, para que desarrollen dientes. ?Y porque tienen las gallinas genes para producir dientes, si siempre están inactivos (las gallinas NUNCA desarrollan esos dientes)?. Respuesta científica: porque su antepasado si tenía dientes, solo que en el curso de la evolución, las gallinas dejaron de necesitarlos (pero el código genético para formarlos sigue dentro de ellas). <br>  <br>  Decir "Dios lo hizo" es como no decir nada.|`|TRvS8DcYaa	Creo que es una pregunta dificil|`|d61277949d1e9ec721a1751a2680e5efaa	Creer en Dios es algo necesario, pues no hay humano con todos sus defectos y demás que pueda crear lo él a creado, Todo el Universo y todo el Infinito...|`|nXINJKGaaa	DIOS SI EXISTE, lo dificil es creer, xq hay muchas doctrinal falsas y sectas y religiones q distorsionan la realidad al hombre. Facil es creer, la misma palabra lo dice, es creer solamente, lo dificil llega al hacer la voluntad de dios, sino conoces a dios ni as tenido un encuentro con el (espiritualemnte hablo eh!) pues es ahi cuando llega lo dificil, Lo q nos falta es fe, y la fe se consigue poko a poko, es la fuerza q te da dios para q sigas en sus caminos.<br>  <br>  <br>  " Que si confesares con tu boca al Se?or Jesús, y creyeres en tu corazón que Dios le levantó de los muertos, serás salvo. Porque con el corazón se cree para justicia; mas con la boca se hace confesión para salud. Porque la Escritura dice: Todo aquel que en él creyere, no será avergonzado."<br>   (romanos 10;9)|`|s7bkR7PCaa	Creer o no creer en Dios no es una pregunta ni una respuesta es mas bien una decisión, decidirse a ser perdonado de corazón y regresar al camino de vida y verdad que él te ofrece, eso es lo difícil pero no imposible.

Nunca he visto que alguien abra el mar, nunca he visto que alguien reviva después de muerto, nunca he visto a un ángel (o cualquier otra criatura milagrosa). Tampoco creo que, cuando cae un árbol, por ejemplo, y no mata a nadie, se pueda considerar un milagro. Eso fue pura suerte. <br>  <br>  Esto no quiere decir que no pueda maravillarme en la naturaleza, en su fuerza, en su suavidad, en el nacimiento de una peque?a ni?a o una flor. Todo eso es increíble, y me puede llenar espiritualmente si lo deseo. Y de ahí viene la espiritualidad, de mi mismo. No necesito de algún otro ser que venga y diga "mira lo que puedo hacer" para sentirme ...........?Cómo lo diría? .............. Conectado. Con el universo si es lo que deseo.

Esta comprobado, que si no estas bien preparado, con estudios superiores, se hace muy difícil alegar o defender cualquier problema de las minorías de todo los tipos en estos países, con los gobiernos que "dan gusto"y que se llenan los bolsillos entre ellos, así que te digo, los derechos los defiende cada cual, y con mucha dignidad, sin empelotarse, para mi es patético.

Celle-ci était achevée, il n'y a pas eu évolution des espèces.<br>  Ce n'est que par la faute de ces premiers humains que la mort est entrée dans le monde. Donc avant qu'ils ne désobéissent à Dieu, il n'y avait ni souffrance, ni lutte pour la survie, ni mort ou disparition d'une espèce.<br>  <br>  Si la mort est toute naturelle pour permettre l'évolution des espèces, nous n'avons pas besoin d'un Christ sauveur, aussi toute l'histoire qui nous est racontée dans la Bible serait un mythe.<br>  <br>  Chose que je ne peux pas envisager.|`|FikZqBoFaa	ce qui est sùr ce qu'il n'etaient pas homosexuels<br>  savez pourquoi Lido ?|`|GfDMCmBpaa	Les premiers qui ont mis des habits...(Dieu les habille de peaux de bêtes avant de les chasser)<br>  <br>  ... peut-être des néanderthaliens ?!<br>  <br>  Personnelement je penche quand même pour la représentation symbolique du premier couple de sapiens, car quand Ca?n est chassé pour avoir tué son frères, il y a sur la terre des "gens" susceptibles de lui faire du mal (des néandertaliens?!)<br>  <br>  @ Blue : à mon avis penser qu'une théorie exclue l'autre et implique un choix de croyance est une fermeture doctrinale : Nul ne détient toute la vérité, mais elle apparait souvent, au contraire,  des recoupements de choses qui ont l'air opposé au premier abord...|`|SC02RnXCaa	c'etaient des denosaures!!|`|eF4QafmGaa	J'ai des pbs avec les coucheries de leur descendance...

Ces personnages font en effet partis du récit biblique, récit qui parle de la création de ces deux personnes par Dieu, et non de leur apparition par un quelconque processus évolutif.

Par contre l'humour sur les religions est parfois la cause de grandes crispations (cette rubrique en est la preuve) qui montre souvent la limite de l'humour de certaines personnes religieuses. Dans ce sens, l'humour religieux peut être considéré comme un oxymore, même si je reste persuadé que beaucoup de gens religieux peuvent avoir du recul et de l'humour sur leur propre religion... mais ils ne sont peut-être pas les plus bruyants ici..|`|GfDMCmBpaa	Suivant avec quelle religion tu tentes l'humour, tu risques de te retrouver occis-mort !|`|e70614d349cdfc5b2b5738f4ab859bcdaa	veux-tu être occis? <br>  c'est plut?t de l'humour garcimore .... la religion !

VhGUnSEcaa	OK, you do need to calm down. It never helps to think about the past as a huge block like that. You are not all that different to anyone else, despite what you may think. Calling yourself a loser isn't going to get you anywhere, so stop thinking in those terms and please change the name of your avatar. <br>  <br>  I don't know exactly what has happened to you in the past but you've given us a fair idea. My teenage years were pretty grim too but there's nothing you can do about the past now. You have to find people you are comfortable with and you aren't going to do that by feeling sorry for yourself and standing still. If you are nervous or angry, people will sense that and perhaps that's why you find it difficult to maintain the friendships. Nobody wants to hang around someone who is miserable either.<br>  <br>  Nothing you have listed is insurmountable. You don't have a life threatening disease, you just lack confidence. Join clubs to make new friends or do something proactive. You have to be positive. You're a virgin at 19, so what? It's a better situation to be in than those guys who slept around in their teens and contracted STDs or got a girl pregnant. Personally, I find it endearing but maybe you would rather be cool than appear nice. You will meet the right girl and it will be special, unlike with most people. Don't just sleep with a random girl to get it over with. Treat yourself with respect and try to relax and enjoy life. The only thing you lack is confidence and you can gain that over time. Good luck.|`|f57ccb8a0a87f487c7ea8b4240010025aa	some people are just losers ... sounds to me like you are one of them.|`|3txvE29yaa	I'D  LIKE  TO  BE   YOUR  FRIEND..........A  TRUE  ONE........NOT  KIDDING|`|8zttwBUXaa	wow i went thru, and am going thru some of the things you listed. but you cant down yourself. you can have confidence, and not be popular. come out the shell a bit, and youll notice a difference. not everyone whores around, partyall the time, and has thousands of friends........face it, your unique and youll have to get out to find what your truly looking for *acceptance*. The trick is not to be accepted, but starts accepting some applications of people who meet your standards in honesty, loyalty ect. <br>  <br>  lol jus chill. dont feel bad for not experiencing all the things ppl brag about. ive experienced some and its overrated ;)|`|AA10717095	You have to begin with your best friend -- YOU.<br>  <br>  You have to like yourself, forgive yourself when you make a mistake, develop your skills and abilities, be the best you can be in all things, be the kind of person you, yourself would respect.<br>  <br>  People will be drawn to the confidence you would exude after doing all that.  It will be automatic.|`|CCmhTIujaa	Dude. Chill. You HAVE friends. They DO call you back. Who cares if you go to a white party or have hispanic friends? People are people. Hang out with the ones you click with. Don't stress it.|`|uHUy1FxNaa	maybe they arent your real friends because rather than choosing them based on their characters you emulate them based on what they look like.  besides, if you went to an all white party looking to hook up with a white b*tch, instead of say an asian or a black chick or whatever, you're that much more likely to be hooking up with some distant cousin.  Then, what happens if you guys go all the way, she gets knocked up, and because instead of mixing it up you let your genes stagnate and look, your unwanted kid has down syndrome.  If you want real friends, don't just try to befriend any cracker because you are for some reason ashamed of your indios background-- be proud that only half your ancestors (the white half) spent the last millenia sh*ting in the streets and wiping their asses with the same bare hands that they ate with, becoming diseased and then spreading that disease to the beautiful, hygienic native peoples of this continent (including the indians the mexicans descend from).  Bein' white aint something to be too proud of if you look at our shameful history, and if the gringos whose clique you are trying to join aren't letting you join the club because you are half latino, then, trust me honey, they arent worth your time or concern.  Reality, karma, whatever, will come back to bite them someday.

Quand on va impitoyablement au fond de tout ce que l'on nomme aujourd'hui l'amour, on n'y découvre plus rien d'autre qu'égo?sme, orgueil, faiblesse de caractère, paresse, vanité et sensualité.<br>  Le véritable amour ne se préoccupe pas de ce qui pla?t à l'être aimé, de ce qui lui est agréable et lui cause de la joie, mais il agit uniquement en fonction de ce qui lui est utile. Peu importe que celui-ci y trouve de la joie ou non ! Voilà la vraie fa?on d'aimer et de servir.<br>  Si donc il est écrit : ? Aimez vos ennemis ! ? cela signifie : ? Faites ce qui leur est utile ! ? ? Chatiez-les par conséquent s'il n'est pas d'autres moyens de les faire revenir à résipiscence ! ? Agir ainsi c'est leur rendre service. Mais il faut en même temps faire régner la justice. Car l'amour est inséparable de la justice. Ils sont un !<br>  Faire inconsidérément preuve d'indulgence équivaut à encourager les défauts de l'ennemi, à le laisser glisser ainsi toujours plus avant sur la pente fatale. Serait-ce là de l'amour ? Ce serait au contraire se rendre soi-même coupable.<br>  Par suite des désirs inavoués des hommes, la religion de l'amour n'est devenue qu'une religion de la faiblesse. C'est ainsi que la personne du Christ jésus, Messager de Vérité, fut avilie par la mollesse ainsi que par l'excessive indulgence qu'on Lui prête et qu'Il n'a jamais eues.<br>  C'est justement parce qu'Il était tout Amour, qu'Il fut rigoureux et sévère à l'égard des hommes d'intellect.<br>  La tristesse qui L'a souvent accablé n'était que trop compréhensible si l'on songe à Sa haute mission et au matériau humain qu'Il avait en face de Lui. Cette tristesse n'avait absolument rien à voir avec la mollesse.<br>  Une fois dépouillée de toutes les altérations et de l'étroitesse dogmatique, la religion de l'amour deviendra un enseignement rigoureusement logique. Dans cet enseignement il n'y aura place ni pour la faiblesse, ni pour une indulgence illogique.|`|6e67b2cc7b8c455d337afb9674d9777aaa	Oui sans aucun problème.<br>  <br>  J'ai raconté l'histoire de Jésus qui coule avec les trous au pied.<br>  Celle où il a pas été sage a l'école, et qu'il doit faire une croix sur ses vacances de paques.<br>  Et plein d'autres...<br>  Donc tu vois j'ai aucun probleme a parler de Jésus.|`|80dede5927cb98005c20d06012f132b8aa	Oui je parle de Jésus et de Dieu car je suis Chrétienne mais uniquement si on m'en parle ou que l'on me pose des questions.

Ce qui l'est davantage, c'est de vivre l'évangile de son mieux. Et je préfère cette seconde option à la première... <br>  <br>  En effet, il me semble que la meilleure fa?on d'annoncer la Bonne Nouvelle, c'est de la vivre, c'est de la devenir !!! C'est beaucoup plus parlant, même si ?a se passe de paroles ! ?a suppose aussi de prier, de donner à l'Esprit l'espace nécessaire pour Le laisser agir à travers soi ; ?a demande de mettre de c?té son orgueil de femme ou d'homme qui veut faire sa propre volonté ;  ?a demande de toujours grandir en humilité : pas facile, pas facile du tout !<br>  <br>  Néanmoins, c'est l'option que je privilégie pour vivre cette responsabilité rattachée à mon baptême : l'annonce de la Bonne Nouvelle. Je ne nomme le Dieu de Jésus Christ que lorsque l'on me pose des questions directes. Il  me semble que la vie d'un-e disciple du Christ devrait être interpellante en soi : c'est ce à quoi je tends !<br>  <br>  Bonne route !|`|jGbg64w0aa	Jésus...............|`|5d320d0937c6725cabf1071c3a1c1032aa	Bonjour<br>  <br>  Quand on me le demande oui mais je ne suis pas douée pour argumenter..Le prosélytisme ..c'est pas trop   mon truc à vrai dire..Mes arguments sont ceux du coeur, je n'y connais rien en théologie..J'emploie des mots simples, non pas du par-coeur, j'essaie de montrer ma sincérité mais mes mots sont maladroits alors..<br>  <br>  Nadinenais|`|zbQiQhdLaa	Ne serait il pas mieux de leur dire qu'"on" les aimes ?<br>  n'est ce pas le message laissé par les prophètes quels qu'ils soient?je trouves que c'est un peu déplacé de croire qu'on peu parler au nom de "dieu" non?|`|768JCci3aa	Moi je n'en parle pas spontanément.

Nous sommes dans une période de grande ignorance, ou peu de personne savent qu'ils ont une ame à sauver.<br>  Dire que Dieu "les" aime ne peut porter des fruits que si nous même "les" aimons! Et cette saleté de péché originel, qui pousse à voir les autres ames avec notre  regard, notre vécu et notre connaissance finalement est terrible : c’est un jugement que nous portons !<br>  <br>  Que c’est dur de déceler Jésus Christ en chacun de nos frères et s?urs ! Et de ne pas les juger, mais les aimer!<br>  <br>  Et qu’il est difficile d’?uvrer à l’avènement du Royaume du Fils ! Qu’il est difficile de vivre du Vivant ! <br>  Tout se mélange très vite : Joie mais tristesse (car à cause de nous nombreux sont ceux qui n’ont pas la chance de connaitre cette Joie), Paix mais combat (car pour chaque ame il faut inventer et livrer un nouvelle bataille).<br>  <br>  Aimer Jésus Christ, aimer les ames,  et se battre ensuite pour le salut des ames ! Après, et seulement après notre ?uvre, c’est Jésus Christ qui travaille et qui moissonne.<br>  <br>  Pour parler de Jésus Christ avec facilité, pour parler du Vivant avec facilité, je crois (et je suis sur et certain) que la prière et l'eucharistie doivent être le creuset et le c?ur de notre vie.|`|DkdOnTSzaa	Oui et une facilité très grande vu que tout le monde connait Jésus à tord ou à travers.|`|JW2TXRYxaa	Oui, je parle facilement et avec joie sur Jésus si j'ai des chrétiens autour de moi.

N'a - t-il pas promis de renier ceux qui auront honte de le témoigner? <br>  <br>  Je le présente à mes interlocuteurs comme le bon Samaritain qui est prêt à voler au secours des nécessiteux, il est celui qui essuie les larmes aux yeux de ceux qui pleurent ( comme la veuve de Na?n ), il est celui qui pourvoit aux besoins des affamés, il est celui qui accueille à bras ouverts même ceux qui ont tout gaspillé dans la débauche ( comme le fils prodige), il est celui qui donne de la famille à ceux qui n'en ont pas , il est celui qui mange et parle avec  les bannis de la société et les fréquente ( comme Zachée, Marie de Béthanie, etc. ), il est celui qui ramène à la vie les ossements et les corps en décomposition.<br>  <br>  Quand j'axe mon entretien sur Jean 3:16, je conseille à mes interlocuteurs d'y remplacer '' le monde'' et '' quiconque '' par '' moi '' et '' je '', ainsi le verset devient: '' Car Dieu m'a tant aimé qu'il a donné son Fils unique afin que je crois en lui,et que je ne périsse point, mais que j'ai la vie éternelle ''. En nous mettant à la place du monde et de quiconque, nous ressentons très bien la grandeur de cet amour de Dieu pour nous. Dieu aime même ceux qui nient son existence dans ce site, il aime tout le monde et son amour nous écrase. <br>  <br>  Si je ne parle pas de Jésus autour de moi de qui parlerai-je d'autre? Qui d'autre est capable de livrer sa vie pour ses amis? Même nos parents biologiques ne peuvent pas le faire. <br>  <br>  Songez à ce silence qui avait déchiré le ciel quand on cherchait celui qui était digne d'ouvrir le livre et d'en rompre le sceau. Personne ne peut  rencontrer Jésus et surtout le recevoir dans sa vie comme Seigneur et Sauveur, est demeurer la même!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Parler de Jésus surtout aux personnes sans espoir, aux drogués, aux tourmentés, aux affligés, etc. vaut plus que leur donner des biens et autres trésors de ce monde.

Kids as a rule are curious not scared, they only become scared if their parents make them feel this is a reaction they should have. All it takes is a 2 minute conversation. " Some people are missing limbs, in wheel chairs, blind, deaf etc etc but that's okay."  It's good for children to see disabled people in the same way they would see anyone else. <br>  <br>  I do a lot of work with children particularly in the summer where I do educational presentations to kids groups. I dress how ever I feel, sometimes I'm in pants other hot days I wear shorts or skirts. My leg is a part of me I'm not going to go out of my way to hide it from the public. <br>  <br>  I once had a co-worker make a rude comment to me suggesting that I hide my prosthetic knee ( which is silver and blue) from the public because it will scare small kids. I was greatly offended and reported her to my employer and made a point of wearing shorts to our next kids activity.  One of the smaller kids had taken a liking to me and followed me around all day. When she got a chance she asked about my leg an I explained that I didn't have a real leg anymore so I wore this one instead. At the same time my rude co-worker came up behind me just in time to her the little girl say." That's cool I like it." <br>  <br>  When ever I go out with my leg clearly showing kids love it. No child has been afraid of me. Even at the public pool when I take my leg off to go swimming I haven't seen any kids terrified of a stump. <br>  <br>  Now parents on the other hand... <br>  If looks could kill I would be dead from some of the glances I get from mothers when I go swimming. <br>  When I was a child I used to take my leg off to use the swing set. If I didn't take it off it would fly off. Some parents were not too happy about me removing my leg, but neither I or my mom cared. <br>  <br>  I think it's sad that parents think that by hiding disabilities in every day life they're some how protecting their kids.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	If they only show her face you can't know about her hand, or lack of one.|`|BevylvVSaa	It is discrimination whenever anyone calls into question a person's ability to do something based on a preconceived notion surrounding their disability. The basis of discrimination is to evaluate a person on the basis of one characteristic only - and in this case it is missing arm.<br>  <br>  From what I have read, there have actually been very few complaints (only 9 by phone), but the few that did complain knew how to complain effectively to get the media's attention. The majority were posted to the BBC website and some were so profane they had to be removed - what does that say about the people lodging the complaints?<br>  <br>  It is actually a brilliant way to get attention to this children's programme and some strong disability advocacy related to children's programming in general.|`|iHkbrJF1aa	I am a registered childminder, lately two of my minded children aged 3 and 4 have started watching the programme for the past few weeks and enjoy it. Being their age makes them inquisitive and they always ask questions about everything in life which is normal. <br>  They did both noticed the presenter was missing her lower arm and hand, and all I said to the 2 children was that the presenter was born that way, just as you and I have brown or black or blonde hair, or brown, blue and green eyes. They had no problem with it what so ever, its down to education and awareness, not to explain and teach children about equality is sheer ignorance on the parents behalf. What would happen if they had a stroke later on in life, or had an accident that resulted them being wheelchair bound and was ridiculed by others just because they themselves develop a disability later on in their own lives?<br>  Its so sad to see there are still ignorant people out there in this day and age, they may find themselves swallowing their own words one day! As explained above.<br>  The 2 presenters hosting the children's show are doing a marvellous job, yes they can actually sing, tell stories and relate to children very well.

0ad3a366087503437b7d34f25e153935aa	ORIGEN DE LAS SIRENAS<br>  <br>  Es una buena pregunta pues yo tenia la duda pero originalemnte las sirenas eran consideradas mujeres con cuerpo de aves y con la fantasia de los marineros se dio origen a las sirenas con cuerpo de mujeres y cola de pez.<br>  <br>  Las sirenas (en griego antiguo Σειρ?ν Seir?n, ‘encadenado’, seguramente inspirado en el sánscrito Kimera, ‘quimera’) son seres fabulosos, originarios de la mitología griega y ampliamente extendidos en las narraciones fantásticas de la literatura occidental, cuya función y representación han variado con el tiempo.<br>  <br>  Aunque en su forma original eran seres híbridos de mujer y ave, posteriormente la representación más común, y la que ha llegado a la actualidad, las describe como mujeres jóvenes con cola de pez. Es por ello que en el idioma inglés se hace la distinción entre la siren (la sirena original clásica) y las mermaids (la sirena con forma de pez).<br>  <br>  Difícil es dilucidar el verdadero origen de las sirenas. Dejando a un lado a las antiguas sirenas con forma de mujeres-ave, se dice que la primera mujer-pez conocida fue Atargatis, la diosa de la luna, protectora de la fecundidad y el amor. Atargatis, perseguida por Mopsos, se sumergió en el lago Ascalón con su hijo, y se salvó gracias a su cola de pez. Esta leyenda se confunde con la de la diosa siria Derceto, que también se arrojó a las aguas del mismo lago, después de matar a uno de sus sacerdotes y abandonar a la hija de ambos en el desierto. Derceto recibió la cola de pez como símbolo de su pecado, y su hija, criada por las palomas, se convirtió en Semíramis, reina de Babilonia. <br>  <br>  También puede encontrarse una semejanza con las sirenas en la diosa Afrodita, hija del semen de Zeus convertido en espuma de mar, que fue diosa del amor y protectora de los marinos. Su espejo ha sido heredado por toda la estirpe de sirenas.<br>  <br>  Para buena parte de los sabios griegos, sin embargo, las sirenas tienen por padre a Aqueloo, un río personificado en figura de hombre con cola de pez. En cuanto a la madre, la confusión crece: puede ser la diosa de la memoria, o alguna de sus hijas, las musas. Quizá las sirenas sean hijas de la Elocuencia, de la Danza, de laTragedia o de la Música. Hasta podrían ser hijas de Ceto, la ballena.|`|0e6e5c8ed55ded35a2dc98c38a4c3fd7aa	con cuerpo de pez, con cuerpo de pajaro es mi suegra.<br>  una "harpia".<br>  jejeje|`|4f6f42881fe71b28b49c914b59f4fba2aa	no las sirenas son unas cosas que tienen una luz y que usan los camiones de bomberos y hacen mucho ruido.,|`|748aM4A0aa	Las sirenas son peces con medio cuerpo de mujer.|`|JHUkmvoLaa	mujeres con cola de pez|`|cMBffYWYaa	con cuerpo de pez|`|leuGLptfaa	son mitad mujer y cola de pez|`|rbKSM4aMaa	son mujeres con cuerpo de pez. las que vuelan se llaman harpias. las sirenas cantan hermoso y atraen a los marineros a naufragar. si quieres ver lo mas cercano a una sirena escribe en imagenes google:   sirena de maracaibo|`|8kN85139aa	una sirena es una criatura horrenda deforme con cola de pez enorme su cuerpo es gris o azul por el agua y porque nunca le el sol,<br>  una arpia es una mujer con alas y con garras que come humanos y solo deja su esqueleto, <br>  la sirena es con cola de pez<br>  la arpia con alas de aguila|`|LHJ43bUQaa	Las sirenas son mitad mujeres y mitad pájaros.

Mis compa?eros me dicen que es por la edad, yo creo que no le podemos poner pretexto, pues tengo 17 a?os e intento escribir bien.

0fc31754dfb32443176fd8ebdd1b956baa	First amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The fourteenth ammendment makes this apply to all levels of government, and since public schools are a government institution it applies to them as well. The first part means that the school cannot endorse any religion, and the second part means that they cannot stop students from praying or getting together and studying religious texts as long as it does not take time away from class. Teaching religion in school would inevitably endorse certain religions, since it is impossible to teach all of them, so religion is left out. Many schools do have an optional world religion class where the "big five" (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism) are discussed, but that course is required by law to be an elective...|`|yAvTxh47aa	If it is a secular classroom, religious education has no place in it.<br>  <br>  If religion wishes to be taught in the classroom it must be taught with the same rigour as other subjects and that means equally stated opposing views. (Equal views that meet the same evidentiary standards.)<br>  <br>  Do you really want atheists and Pagans and Satanists to have fair time with your religion in the classroom?<br>  <br>  As a parent, I'm capable of teaching my son religion. I don't see why my son should have to suffer in a class day that ALREADY doesn't have enough time for real learning, like science labs, just because some other parents are too lazy to teach their kids religion.<br>  <br>  And if it's not YOUR kids you want religion taught to, you need to sit down and mind your own damn business about other people's kids.|`|37ab3b548443ae93a5a0b514ffc24bcaaa	Because in most public schools, not everyone in a classroom is the same religion. However, I do believe it should be available as an optional class.|`|710becf5fb1b54fa5caf92a6544c92fdaa	I don't see why it shouldn't.  If a student is willing to learn about Christianity or Judaism or Islam or Scientology then good for them<br>  <br>  You do have a bit of a rough spot between church and state though.  So college is a good option.|`|AA10555973	It depends if it is being preached like in Sunday school, or taught like theology. The teacher could start to preach a certain religion, and that could be bad, especially to younger kids who think it's as well founded as geography. It should be like a college theology class, multiple religions that is, to older students who can think for themselves. The teacher should also be able to teach without preaching. This is the only way it should be done.|`|e95c1e0e0ee652ade5fd8fec476ac4e7aa	You said "thought" but I think you meant "taught". I believe religion should be taught from an objective standpoint. If we do not teach religion in our schools, people will instead learn it from crooks and scam artists who are after their money.|`|MxSYFJCZaa	Because the US doctrine clearly states that there shall be clear & concise separation between church & state. (With exception for those who attend Catholic schools.)|`|dyENQf2xaa	Because the schools need to focus on teaching people like yourself to spell. Or maybe you actually meant "thought"? Yes, religion is a "thought".
K6fasl6kaa	lots about this situation is not fair but you will have to work with it.  were he trying to teach you responsibility, and he doesn't have to be your father for that, would he not have taught you that the responsible thing to do would be to buy the insurance or service plan offered at purchase?  if it was a gift, then there should not be any question about paying him back for it.  we all know that when we give gifts, they are not appreciated or taken care of at times, without saying this is the case here, gift given; done.  don't throw any of what i'm saying at him in confrontation, that would be disrespectful.  it is just my opinion offered to help.  on the other hand, what should you do?  the only decision i see that you need to make is whether you want to maintain a working laptop.  you have the money saved.  even if he can better afford the repair and you have other plans for the money, it's your computer.  you will have to decide between the importance of the trip or the repair.  don't expect anyone else to fix it just because that would be fair and what you want.  if you decide in favor of the holiday, you have the option of offering him the broken computer if he wants to be compensated  for a gift.  welcome to the world of adulthood and all its inconsistencies, mixed motives and unfairness.  and people look forward to it.  its not all bad or good but its life and what we make of it.  i hope you make a wise decision and are happy with it.  shoot me an email to let me know if you don't mind.  if not, ok.  best regards,M|`|paerqxfMaa	Well he paid $900 for something that you're not using.  He evidently thought you needed on and bought one for you.  Now it's been siting unused because you won't pay to have it fixed, so I guess he feels like it was a waste of money.  If you don't think it's important enough to have repaired, he probably feels it wasn't important enough to buy it for you.  Tell him you're sorry for taking his gift for granted, explain that you would like to get it fixed and could he maybe help you out with 1/2 - which you would pay back.  You have to be willing to cough up 1/2 now.  Take $250 from your holiday money - economize a little on your trip.  He will see you are willing to make an effort and he may help you out.|`|LkHzsRcDaa	Why don't you get the computer fixed? I'm sure it doesn't cost $500, but how did it get broken? If it's a gift, then you shouldn't have to pay him back. That was very wrong for him to have asked, and if you don't want to use the laptop, then that's your matter, not his. If the laptop's new, maybe there's a warranty where the fix is free.|`|db9f4e17f5a919d6fbcc6f293a58f828aa	Why isn't the motherboard warranteed? If it were new it should have been. Either way I don't think you should have to pay for this, it wasn't your fault.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Sounds like he is trying to teach you responsibility. Life is not free or a life long holiday. It has its ups and downs and responsibility is a huge one.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	Maybe you can compromise or bargain with her.|`|hxxOIm1Maa	If it was a gift, stuffed him! you don't own him nothing. Go and enjoy your holiday and when you come back start saving to buy a new laptop so he can see you really care, but your priorities aren't the same as his at the moment.<br>  Or maybe he doesn't want you to go to holiday for some reason.|`|6Kq1ExFxaa	You broke it.

xSdnsSojaa	The way I've always heard the expression is woodpile, not woodheap, but essentially it refers to an undisclosed or hidden factor that affects the situation adversely. A monkey wrench in the works.<br>  <br>  I'd guess that the character in the novel used the expression to indicate that, since he'd have no legal standing in attempting to oppose a divorce openly, he instead chooses to sabotage the case by stealth and trickery.

Indeed.<br>  <br>  To those that say that the first miracle was the turning water into wine, I say, read the following and tell me if that is not a miracle (and it comes before the water-wine one!):<br>  <br>  John 1:48-49 . . ." Jesus in answer said to him: "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you." 49 Nathanael answered him: "Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel. . .<br>  <br>  ----<br>  If that doesn't qualify as a miracle, I don't know one when I see it.<br>  <br>  In the Bible I read, the water-wine miracle is called the first sign.

Thus the miracle of far-sight, far-knowledge, that Jesus had was not a sign, but a miracle.|`|onkUcy19aa	Jesus' First Miracle<br>  <br>        The unmistakable miracle recorded in John 2: 1-11 is of great importance for several reasons. This miracle of Jesus turning the water into wine was Jesus' first miracle (Jn. 2: 11). This initial miracle prepared Jesus' disciples for the great work they were to do. As a result of the miracle we read, "…and his disciples believed on him" (vs. 11). The miracle also illustrates the nature of true Bible miracles and can be easily distinguished from the "lying wonders" of the First Century and today (cp. 2 Thes. 2: 9). It is regrettable that this wonderful miracle has been abused to advocate social drinking. Please consider the miracle and then we shall comment on it.<br>  <br>       "1: And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: 2: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.  3: And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 4: Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 5: His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 6: And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 7: Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 8: And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. 9: When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 10: And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. 11: This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."<br>  <br>   "The miracle itself was turning water into wine; the substance of water acquiring a new form, and having all the accidents and qualities of wine. Such a transformation is a miracle; but the popish transubstantiation, the substance changed, the accidents remaining the same, is a monster. By this Christ showed himself to be the God of nature, who maketh the earth to bring forth wine, Ps. 109:14, 15. The extracting of the blood of the grape every year from the moisture of the earth is no less a work of power, though, being according to the common law of nature, it is not such a work of wonder, as this. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood (Ex. 4:9; 7:20), the beginning of Christ’s miracles was turning water into wine; which intimates the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ."|`|z74a7wvlaa	The inspired bible miracle is off course, the water turned to wine. You will be surprised, that toddler 2-yrs old Jesus did perform miracles while in Egypt. There are churches in Egypt that commemorate the flight of the Holy Family; the Virgin Mary, as dispenser of grace in behalf of the Infant Jesus, is big in Egypt, thus the churches were named after her.  <br>  e.g. day 5 - Al Muharraq Monastery which has the oldest altar-stone in history and was built inside the Cave that was used by the Holy Family. This was the resting place of Jesus during the months he dwelt there and has been named by the Copts of Egypt the second Bethlehem.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

AA11047076	1) Thankfully this is not the case in South Africa.  Over here- a jewish education is seen as a right of every child by the community- those who can't afford it are subsidised (and many do get it free).   Of course- this drives up the fees for those that can afford it- and yet many choose to pay the high fees- some who should be asking for subsidies but feel it is their duty to pay the full fees to ensure that other people's children that otherwise could not go- can go, evne considering the financial strain it places on them<br>  2) My children go to a Yeshiva type school- but then my wife teaches there and one of the perks is that they get reduced fees because she teaches there.  What is great about their school is that it offers an excellent Torah education- but also has some of the best matric results of any school in the country!<br>  3) A big issue is the ethos of the schools.  here in Johannesburg it has been an interesting phenomenon in recent years that the schools with the strongest Torah education are gaining the most students- those that only have a nominal Jewish education are losing students to other private schools where parents see the secualr education as being the equal or better than the one in Jewish Day Schools- with the benefit of making contacts in other societies.  A Jewish Day School needs to be Jewish- confusing that identity, diluting it, makes it just another expensive private school- and parents will then choose schools based on criteria other than the espoused (but not followed) religious basis of the school.<br>  <br>  On top of that- the schools need to acknowledge the issue of parents who are not knowledgeable about Judaism- having to cope with children that are more knowledgeable than them.  at my children's school it is a very real issue.  We have families where the parents are non-observant and sending their children their so they will learn about Judaism- but how does a parent who is uneducated in Judaism help a child in grade 5 with Chumash and discussing Rashi's commentary on it- when they are barely able to read hebrew- let alone Rashi script?  As such- there needs to be either a lot of teacher parent involvement- sending materials directly to parents to help them prepare and saty ahead of their children (or at least give them a quick summary of the material so they don't feel completely lost in talking about school work with their children), up to and including adult education classes so that they, too, improve in their knowledge of yiddishkeit and don;t feel threatened by their children's growing knowledge and comfort with it!|`|d2a383c39b3b208bfabae696fef5a7e7aa	if i had kids i would send them to a jewish school in a heartbeat, but in all likelihood i know that any kids i have will probably be going to a regular public school, due to me not being loaded with $$.|`|AA11439912	I have four kids and there is no way I can afford to send my kids. If tuition was free or if I could afford it all my kids would be there as opposed to public school.|`|UIhn5LCHaa	That's just it, there are plenty of motives why conservatives and or reform yeshiva's are not doing so well on one side children pick up on basic jewish culture,  they like there malnourished  jewish identity which they are not getting at home, and find that there Neshama is being awaken and they bring this excitment home with them and their parents don't know what to do with it since they have been so distent from observing their obligations as yid's. Also perhaps since yidim all over are recognizing that there cannot be a contridictive life style, the orthodox way of life or should I say the Torah way of life is based on high demands of moral ethics not what the  world offers should we follow but that of our L-rd whom gave us his word, the blueprint of our lives.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	Wow, great questions!  Although we sent our daughter to a Catholic high school (oy, big mistake, but that's for another time) our son went to a Jewish middle school and is going to a Jewish high school, which he loves.<br>  <br>  So:  1)  Yes, absolutely, it would help if the schools were free.  We're spending about $25 K a year for his education and, while I don't begrudge the money a bit, the overwhelming majority of Jews can't afford this; 2)  Not applicable (see above); 3)  In our community, you have to make it obvious that the school has the same standards as other schools in the area, and isn't there just to teach Judaica and Hebrew.|`|d4e173ca2aeaa15a3cdcfd9288ac3f68aa	Fantastic question. Wow. In the 50s, Rabbi Issac Domb from Manchester predicted that unless certain trends stopped the enrollment in Jewish frum schools would decrease.<br>  <br>   Unfortunately the trends have continued. His suggestions were that it should be realized that a Jewish school will not be able to compete in gashmius with a school funded by every tax payer in the country; thus it must be realized there is a reason such schools are callled Heders. They must have simpler buildings with less insurance and tax overhead, possibly being moved back into people's homes around the community. <br>  <br>  He also felt that the trend to glorify secular higher education as a mark of achievement needed to be curbed; rather secular higher education must be viewed as an annoying necessity for some  that may be required sometimes so that a person incapable of finding sufficient income without it can recieve necessary income to provide his basic needs and  TO FURTHER TORAH EDUCATION. <br>  <br>  Without this schools would come to require more and more money, and thus higher tuitions, in order to teach to prepare for higher education (sic) rather than spending time on the inexpensive Torah education. The Gra method is to teach mathematics and Torah meomorization and thinking. The math helps with Torah and being the only "secular" subject emphasized will be superior to other schools math programs, combined with the advanced logic and  reasoning skills gifted by the Torah, any "graduate": will have no problem competing outside.<br>  <br>  Lastly for this answer, he felt that the gross materialism that has come to plague some needs to be actively countered by the rabbonim. If a person has a luxery automobile, but there are children who cannot afford a Torah education and are being shmadded (yes shmadded) into secularism by Public schools, this is a mark of evil. How can a person drive a car that's price difference between an equally reliable one is the cost of a Jewish soul. Pay some boys tuition instead of getting the nicer car. G-d will make up the difference in the next world. <br>  <br>  He was so ademate about these things he at one point calls cetain people who disagreed with him, "The acclaimed builders of buildings and killers of jews."|`|aYdxvLOuaa	The ultimate answer is that all Jews regardless of background need to start performing mitzvahs and live life according to the Torah and not the reform or conservative movements. They need to stop being lazy and mixed in with the goyim and do what Hashem commands them. If the Jewish people as a whole came together in the service of Hashem you wouldn't have problems of parents being afraid of the kids knowing too much or more than they do. You would have Jews doing what they are supposed to according to G-D's plan. For those who say they can't afford to send their kids, I have to ask: Have you contacted the religious schools for payment arrangements and or financial help? They usually will work with families since a Jewish education is priceless.

For you were bought with a price: Therefore glorify God in you body, and in your spirit which are God's." Much modem evidence shows smoking and drugs to be a health hazard to the extent that each package of cigarettes must by law, bear this message, "Warning: the Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to you health." Obviously, something dangerous to the health cannot possibly enhance, or build up, the body. Smoking and drugs are contrary to healthy practices and acts to weaken or destroy the body which is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Christians do not own their own bodies, their bodies are Christ's, bought and paid for by his death. Christians are not free to use their bodies for pleasure and in any way they choose. They are to glorify God in their bodies and since smoking and drugs do not glorify God, smokers are in violation of this precept.|`|AA10317644	It doesn't.

1Pjra6Rcaa	I don't remember hearing anything that specific.  The counsel is to use the internet judiciously, be careful to avoid explicit chat rooms, and avoid pronographic sites.  As always, you have your free agancy and must choose to do what you think is right.  If you feel that having a myspace is not what you should do, then you shouldn't do it.  You are entitled to confirmation of your decision through prayer and the witness of the Holy Ghost.  Following the counsel of the prophet will keep you on the straight and narrow path, but blindly following his counsel, without prayerful contemplation will not be of great benefit to you. In the future, you might want to do a search on lds.org rather than posing your question to the entire Yahoo Answers community.

6UEK1TPaaa	The doctrine of inerrancy has applied to the original manuscripts, which we do not have... Not to current translations.  What is important to think of in the reading of Scripture is that God has preserved his word faithfully and that if any error of transcription is not going to effect any doctrine of the faith.<br>  <br>  For instance, from the Dead Sea Scrolls to the Masoretic Texts, take Isaih 53, arguably the most Christogenic book in the Old Testament.  Despite a time difference of approximately 1000 years between the translations, the few differences that exist are grammatical in nature, and not one would change doctrine...|`|xPkJdEEYaa	There are many groups out there that have tried repeatedly to make the bible appear as a fairy tale.

There have been many books written by atheist setting out to disprove the bible.

ZuzSUymFaa	I too am a Christian.  All I can tell you about this is that I believe that God forgives each of us if we sincerely ask for forgiveness.  Yes, we are to do our best to follow His commandments and to obey His Word.  We will fail many times, but the thing we ought to do is to try our best not to make the same mistake over and over again.  We can't go around deliberately sinning and then saying "well, God will forgive me if I just ask", because God knows our hearts and our intent.  <br>  <br>  I divorced my husband after 20 years of marriage.  We had a Christian marriage.  Thing is, my ex-husband was very controlling, verbally and emotionally abusive (physically abusive to our kids however), and he was cruel.  He did many selfish, uncaring acts in the name of God and would justify himself by saying that God gave him that right as the husband and head of the family.  He abused the marriage relationship as described in the Bible.  I held firm to my marriage vows and stuck by him despite how miserably unhappy I was.  It wasn't until my father was on his deathbed and I was called to be with him, 1300 miles away in my hometown, that my husband's true character finally became evident after 19 years of marriage.  My son was already visiting family back home and was with my father.  My ex-husband (we were still married then) snuck in the back door of the house and took our daughter from me when I was upstairs and prevented me from seeing her or talking with her on the phone.  He had his mother's help (his father, a minister, had already died the year before) and he took our daughter to his mother's home.  He did this right before my father died.  Because of what my ex-husband did, I feared that he would take my daughter somewhere and I would never see her again.  I therefore decided to take her with me to see my father before he died and figure out what I was going to do from my home state of California.  When I went to my child's school to pick her up and take her to California to see my father, he had instructed her to scream and cry out if she saw me, despite her being a "mama's girl" and very attached to me.  While trying to straighten this out with the school officials who didn't know who to allow my daughter to go with, my ex snatched my daughter, put her in the car without her seatbelt on and sped out of the school parking lot.  My father died the next day, my birthday.  I didn't get to see him before he died.  To me, taking my child from her mother in the manner in which he did, and violating the marriage trust in such a way, was just about the most horrible thing my husband could have done.  My father died on my birthday.  My ex told my then 6-year-old daughter that it was God's punishment to me for trying to take my child to California to see my dad.  I filed for divorce that very day. <br>  <br>  Is divorce wrong when it doesn't follow Biblical reasons for divorce? Yes.  Was this an easy decision for me? No.  As I said, I stayed in an abusive marriage for 19 years before I filed for divorce because I don't believe in divorce.  I was separated from my husband for an entire year while fighting for custody of my daughter.  He kept trying to delay court hearings so that my child would be with him longer and the court would rule that she had adjusted to being with him and not me.  During this time, my ex had many opportunities to apologize for what he had done and try to make our marriage work.  Instead, he professed his undying love for me, all while blaming me for everything that happened.  I felt I had no choice but to divorce him and didn't feel after being treated as cruelly as I was, that God would want me trapped in a marriage to a man I was no longer living with, and never be allowed to find happiness and marry again.  Even till the last moment, if my ex would have just took responsibility for what he did, I would have postponed the divorce and gone through counseling in an attempt to save the marriage.  He refused.  The divorce went through and the judge awarded me custody of both kids and my ex to take parenting and anger management classes.  <br>  <br>  I believe I sinned by divorcing my husband because while he did cheat on me in my 3rd year of marriage, that was not my reason for divorce.  I also believe that God saw my heart and my motives and knew I did my best to be the best wife and mother I could be.  God knew that I would not have gone through with the divorce if my husband had shown any indication that he truly cared enough about our marriage to take responsibility for his part in the failure of it.  God knew how much I suffered, for 2 months after my father died, my Down's Syndrome brother died suddenly.  The following month, my mother's elderly dog fell in the swimming pool and my elderly mother was too weak to pull the dog out before the dog had a heart attack and died.  This happened on my mother's birthday.  5 months after that, my own mother died unexpectedly.  While all of this was going on, I was in a horrific legal battle in an effort to get custody of my daughter (my son was already back in California with me since my father died - I only left my daughter with my ex because the court wouldn't allow her to leave the state to come with me until custody was established, and my ex kept having custody hearings postponed - it was agonizing for me, but I left my child with him so that I could fight my ex-husband with family support - I was all alone in Washington state, where I had been living).  <br>  <br>  God saw my pain and hurt and not only allowed me to have custody of my daughter, but He worked it out so that 1 year to the exact day that my ex took my daughter from me, she was ordered to be returned to me.  Despite repeated attempts on the part of my ex to have court hearings postponed for his own advantage, these repeated postponements ended up making the final hearing - or trial as it turned out to be, such that my child was ordered to be returned to me on the exact date that she was taken from me to begin with.  If that is not God's hand,  don't know what is.  God forgave me for my sin of divorce.  I didn't enter into divorce lightly, and God knew that.<br>  <br>  Fast forward to today.  God has since given me a wonderful man who is kind, thoughtful, sweet, loving, respectful and helpful.  I married him last weekend.  He treats me with the sincere love and respect I never had with my ex.  I couldn't be happier.  I don't believe that I am committing adultery by marrying again after divorce because I believe God forgave me and I have seen His hand in the selection of my new husband, and have experienced His blessings in my life. <br>  <br>  We should do our best as Christians to follow all the commandments of the Bible and to hold fast to the guidelines contained therein.  Still, when we make mistakes, I believe wholeheartedly that God will forgive us if we sincerely ask and we try not to sin in the same way again.  Christ died to forgive us of our sins.  If our sins could not be forgiven when we sincerely ask and try not to make the same mistakes again, then Christ would have died in vain.  Sorry for my very lengthy answer, but this is something I feel passionately about and I wanted to address your very good question with a lot of serious thought.|`|9yLTvbgraa	I'd never say people are better at something than God is.

God is way better then a church and besides without God  church would be absolutely nothing. and besides a church is God's second house 1 counting as heaven and 2nd counting as churches.all you have to do is ask for Gods forgiveness whenever you do wrong and admit your sins to God and accept jesus as a friend and a saviour.|`|897bed937a1c363c649000f755b6d09daa	I think churches are no where near as forgiving as God is.  If God was not a forgiving God there would not be a single soul on this earth.  God gives us chances every day to ask for forgiveness.  It's our choice to decide we want it.  When we ask for forgiveness God does not throw it back in our face if we sin again.  Whereas, humans are always on the look out for a person to go back to there old ways.|`|60e5cb843bb6487d500ee715c0a8a09caa	You answered your question in part by referring to a modern perversion of the bible. Does that sound harsh? The NIV is used to undermine the most foundational beliefs of the Christian faith. Verses that teach us that Jesus is God, that he was born of a virgin have been changed. Verses about the blood have been omitted. These changes to the word of God have had the effect of making the truth of faith in Jesus Christ relative to each individual. The double-mindedness of the world has come into the church. This should not be so, but in Revelation 18:2 we are told what has happened to the church that the world has come into, and what we are to do in verse 4. It says: 2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.<br>  <br>  If we stay in a church where there is double-mindedness and sin then we are disobeying God and we are putting ourselves in danger of being turned over to a reprobate mind, of losing discernment and of not being able to fight the devil.

I'm sure many would love it if they were, but seems to me that most school kids don't worry about religion like that.  It's the parents that cause the trouble when it comes to that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Example: My son wore a pentacle to school.  It wasn't until some of the other kids in his classes told their parents that any trouble was started over it.  Parents raised hell with the school, using the idea that the pentacle is a gang symbol (probably because most schools don't want to touch the religion thing).  The school contacted me and told me their concerns.  I sent emails to his teachers, the principal and his counselor showing them that the most popular gang symbol is the cross.  After one meeting with the principal and counselor, the "charge" was dropped and never brought up again.<br>  <br>  School kids are mainly worried about what brand name is on their clothes and where their friends are going to be this weekend.  Most of them don't care what religion the other kid is.|`|a27323f83f883a798e36d714e72969feaa	No. It's not.|`|b12943cba4f67f7831f04b85091f69fdaa	WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GET THAT INFORMATION?

Honest, I don't!<br>  Let me explain if they say three in one , I think it is not right because Jehovah God is ONE! No, body else can be God but you will have to remember Jesus is Son of God ,for that reason God has made Jesus then how can they become trinity? IMPOSSIBLE!<br>  One is true is Jehovah God and he is all over power to earth and even out of space he is God read in Plasm 83:18 and it will tell you. Remember Jesus is Son of God.<br>  Jesus already told in the Bible he said "Father"( he was talk to his Father) and "Father , is greater than I am" so how in the world can they be trinity?<br>  Trinity is myth! You will never find a word TRINITY.<br>  I hope this help.|`|4hsl2toNaa	The best and truthful explanation is, it is a false teaching.  Jesus never taught it, nor did the Apostles or the early Christians.   The teaching was adapted by the Catholic Church long after Jesus died and exists today.  It is not in the bible.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	You're explaining God through hair and eggs??<br>  I don't mean to be offensive, but I've heard this 'explanation' before(I've asked a question on the trinity and no one could explain it), and what I don't get is why an example needs to be given when describing a religious aspect.<br>  I also find it surprising that you need to ask everyone if your description is correct. Do you yourself know what the trinity means? Again, no offense, just my thoughts. :-)|`|AA10671142	there is no place in the bible that teaches the Trinity. Matthew 26 verse 39.

The Father is not the same person as the Son; the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as Father. They are not three gods and not three beings. They are three distinct persons; yet, they are all the one God. Each has a will, can speak, can love, etc., and these are demonstrations of personhood. They are in absolute perfect harmony consisting of one substance. They are coeternal, coequal, and copowerful. If any one of the three were removed, there would be no God.|`|K2nbcyKSaa	That is a hard question and I have a thought that might be wrong also but look at Ephesians 5:21-32. I believe in Genesis it speaks of a man being joined to his wife and the two becoming one flesh. Jesus Christ and his church and believers becoming bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. This is a mystery so the Trinity is a mystery. The husband and wife are one flesh so the spiritual Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit can be together in a wonderful perfect God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. The Trinity is a wonderful doctrine for me because I feel safe and do not worry ,too much.  Our union with God is not perfect but the church in heaven is the best church, and with Jesus.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	Argh humans do not have a spirit/soul!!! the bible says man came to BE a soul - the word spirit often means breath (in the original language) so its not the spirit going back, it is the life force - since God created life, the life goes back to him<br>  his purpose was to have humans live on the earth, not go to heaven, so there was no need for a soul!<br>  ecclesiastes says the dead know nothing - and that we will die and return to dust, also the "soul that sinneth will die"<br>  and because "all have sinned" and man BECAME a soul - this leads you to conclude<br>  we don't have an immortal spirit!<br>  <br>  i have an illustration you may want to apply in a different way<br>  say america go to war - they can fight in the name of the president, the american citizen, and democracy - as all these are part of the american system - BUT they are separate things, and one isn't even a person! you can quite easily fight for an ideology<br>  and although the president and the citizen are american, they are separate people<br>  <br>  so apply this now....<br>  you have an almighty God (YHWH) and his Son who are both spirits (i.e. americans in the analogy) but one has ultimate authority - and they are separate beings<br>  <br>  edit* also, can i just say the hebrew word elohim is in plural form because of a hebrew grammatical technique - it is called the Plural of Majesty - because their language is different (duh) and they have different rules, and the words that we have to explain things that they didn't - so rather than implying multiple gods, it implies the importance of the one who the term is applying to|`|hms0bSiaaa	One God in three Persons. Just like time: past, present and future. God chose not to reveal fully the mystery of the Trinity.  God the Father is the Truth, Jesus is the Truth, Holy Spirit is the Truth. God the Father is the Creator, Jesus is the Creator, the Holy Spirit is the Creator. How can we comprehend the meaning of this?  Anyway, none of us can really rightly and exactly explain Trinity. Good try.|`|CjJKUMl8aa	Trinity is a theological term to explain about GOD the Father, GOD the Son and Holy Spirit. It's not found in the Bible because it's a term use by theologians.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	you are finding it hard to describe because it does not make sense. the bible does not teach a trinity|`|AA11719394	The Trinity is a concept that is impossible for any human being to fully understand, let alone explain. God is infinitely greater than we are, therefore we should not expect to be able to fully understand Him. The Bible teaches that the Father is God, that Jesus is God, and that the Holy Spirit is God. The Bible also teaches that there is only one God. Though we can understand some facts about the relationship of the different persons of the Trinity to one another, ultimately, it is incomprehensible to the human mind. However, this does not mean it is not true or not based on the teachings of the Bible.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind when studying this subject that the word "Trinity" is not used in Scripture. This is a term that is used to attempt to describe the triune God, the fact that there are three coexistent, co-eternal persons that make up God. Understand that this is NOT in any way suggesting three Gods. The Trinity is one God made up of three persons. There is nothing wrong with using the term "Trinity" even though the word is not found in the Bible. It is shorter to say the word "Trinity" than to say "three coexistent, co-eternal persons making up one God." If this presents a problem to you, consider this: the word grandfather is not used in the Bible either. Yet, we know there were grandfathers in the Bible. Abraham was the grandfather of Jacob. What should be of real importance is that the concept that is represented by the word "Trinity" does exist in Scripture. With the introduction out of the way, Bible verses will be given in discussion of the Trinity.<br>  <br>  1) There is one God: Deuteronomy 6:4; 1 Corinthians 8:4; Galatians 3:20; 1 Timothy 2:5.<br>  <br>  2) The Trinity consists of three Persons: Genesis 1:1; 1:26; 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8; 48:16; 61:1; Matthew 3:16-17; Matt 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14. In the passages in the Old Testament, a knowledge of Hebrew is helpful. In Genesis 1:1, the plural noun "Elohim" is used. In Genesis 1:26; 3:22; 11:7 and Isaiah 6:8, the plural pronoun for "us" is used. That "Elohim" and "us" refer to more than two is without question. In English, we only have two forms, singular and plural. In Hebrew, you have three forms: singular, dual, and plural. Dual is for two ONLY. In Hebrew, the dual form is used for things that come in pairs like eyes, ears, and hands. The word "Elohim" and the pronoun "us" are plural forms—definitely more than two—and must be referring to three or more, in this case Father, Son, Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  In Isaiah 48:16 and 61:1, the Son is speaking while making reference to the Father and the Holy Spirit. Compare Isaiah 61:1 to Luke 4:14-19 to see that it is the Son speaking. Matthew 3:16-17 describes the event of Jesus' baptism. Seen in this is God the Holy Spirit descending on God the Son while God the Father proclaims His pleasure in the Son. Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 are examples of three distinct persons in the Trinity.<br>  <br>  3) The members of the Trinity are distinguished one from another in various passages: In the Old Testament, "LORD" is distinguished from "Lord" (Genesis 19:24; Hosea 1:4). The LORD has a Son (Psalm 2:7, 12; Proverbs 30:2-4). Spirit is distinguished from the “LORD” (Numbers 27:18) and from "God" (Psalm 51:10-12). God the Son is distinguished from God the Father (Psalm 45:6-7; Hebrews 1:8-9). In the New Testament John 14:16-17, Jesus speaks to the Father about sending a Helper, the Holy Spirit. This shows that Jesus did not consider Himself to be the Father or the Holy Spirit. Consider also all of the other times in the Gospels where Jesus speaks to the Father. Was He speaking to Himself? No. He spoke to another person in the Trinity—the Father.<br>  <br>  4) Each member of the Trinity is God: The Father is God: John 6:27; Romans 1:7; 1 Peter 1:2. The Son is God: John 1:1, 14; Romans 9:5; Colossians 2:9; Hebrews 1:8; 1 John 5:20. The Holy Spirit is God: Acts 5:3-4; 1 Corinthians 3:16. (The One who indwells is the Holy Spirit - Romans 8:9; John 14:16-17; Acts 2:1-4).<br>  <br>  5) The subordination within the Trinity: Scripture shows that the Holy Spirit is subordinate to the Father and the Son, and the Son is subordinate to the Father. This is an internal relationship and does not deny the deity of any person of the Trinity. This is simply an area which our finite minds cannot understand concerning the infinite God. Concerning the Son see: Luke 22:42; John 5:36; John 20:21; 1 John 4:14. Concerning the Holy Spirit see: John 14:16; 14:26; 15:26; 16:7 and especially John 16:13-14.<br>  <br>  6) The tasks of the individual members of the Trinity: The Father is the ultimate source or cause of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; Revelation 4:11); divine revelation (Revelation 1:1); salvation (John 3:16-17); and Jesus' human works (John 5:17; 14:10). The Father initiates all of these things.<br>  <br>  The Son is the agent through whom the Father does the following works: the creation and maintenance of the universe (1 Corinthians 8:6; John 1:3; Colossians 1:16-17); divine re

One of the major theologians of the Church (I can't remember which one - possibly St. Augustine) said that if you live like there is a God and you're wrong, you didn't lose anything.. But if you live like there is a God and you're right you've won everything.<br>  2. If you believe in Karma, how do you explain how bad things happen to good people?<br>  3. There's so much proof that Christ actually existed. He was written about by people who believe in Him and people who didn't. (For example: Cornelius Tactitus and Josephus - both secular Roman historians, Thallus and Phlegon - Roman historians who talked about Jesus' crucifixion. Then of course you have the gospel writers - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.) Jesus existence and life is actually well documented. There's historical proof for a lot of what people argue over - the Last Supper. It actually happened. There was an empty tomb.<br>  4. Once you accept the fact that Jesus existed - there's only two options. Either he was crazy and he was telling the truth.<br>  5. God doesn't give us false hope. God gives us true hope - that there's something greater than just this life. So when there's greed, war, etc. we're not left to wallow in misery. Christians are called to live their lives like Christ did - that includes suffering like he did. ("Whoever wishes to be like me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me." - Luke 14:27) But the good thing is that we see the light at the end of the tunnel - that at the end of this suffering is the resurrection and we rise to eternal life with God. That's hope. Hope in a love that is greater than any love we could ever imagine. <br>  <br>  Hope that answers some of your questions/points.<br>  God bless.|`|J6InMmqIaa	The whole political system is Religious, I mean If today an atheist is running for puppet president, people wont vote.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	RAmen.

However, by denying Hell, the unbeliever is giving the lie to One of infinite dignity, pride, and glory, Who is sublimely and infinitely powerful, and is accusing Him of impotence, lying, and powerlessness; he is insulting His dignity and offending His pride terribly. He is rebelliously causing affront to His glory.

AA11263450	Small town living in the Midwest will always be more restrictive, because everyone knows everyone, it's very clicky and usually religious based by the local church of the area.  However the bigger cities are quite different.  Here in Wisconsin,  cities like Madison, Milwaukee and Oshkosh you can see openly gay people out at events.  I live in Oshkosh and there is a quietly thriving gay lifestyle here.  It can be seen through our artists, book stores, natural food stores and new age shops.  We've only ever had one gay rally here since I've lived here and that was lively, but nothing compared to many I've heard about.  Sit on State St. in Madison during college and the summer.  There you will see all kinds of diverse peoples, so many it makes my head spin.  They have the best shops there for the alternative lifestyle.  We try to visit twice a year.  I am not unhappy about the "general" tolerance of my state, even if they did ban gay marriage this last November.  It was a poorly written addendum which confused the older demographic of voters.  Ah well, life goes on.|`|b70599a0829dd4deed571c9132f73590aa	It really depends on where you live.

But, in the larger cities (KC and, where I live, St. Louis), there are pretty large gay communities....AND we can register for domestic partnership (which my partner and I have done).  Of course, even in the big cities, there are still plenty of bigots....but a lot more people who are accepting.

I'll give you a little real-life perspective if you care to read it. I lived in a rural town in southern Oklahoma for five years, and homosexuals were highly marginalized. Bear in mind that I am very effeminate/camp and quite obviously homosexual, my gay best friend and I both led fairly hassle-free normal lives there but homosexuals were expected to never actually verbally confirm that they had a preference for males or disinterest in females. Anyone who did so was completely disowned by local culture, there was no such thing as an openly gay person in that area. There were maybe one or two who dared, and they were considered by literally everyone to "have a sickness" or "just be very depressed and lonely". They were a great curiosity to the entire community and heavily scorned.<br>  I have since lived in north Dallas for 3 years. About 5 out of 40 employees at my work are openly homosexual, the other day a guy I work with was telling some heterosexual co-workers the story of how he met his partner right out in front of the customers. I don't work in the "gay part of town" or anything like that. If I had to estimate based on all the people I've encountered and dealt with since being here, I'd say about 50% don't really approve but don't treat me any differently, 35% truly don't care a bit or even approve of it, and 15% are openly hostile or give the evil eye / cold shoulder.|`|b8d71f8fc9db48f4ed898eecf1794bf2aa	Much of the mid west is the called to as the "Bible Belt"  there is little tolerance in small towns for those who are gay.

AA11645770	Try a google search.<br>  <br>  Satanism, the kind practiced in America and the English speaking world, is based on the works of Anton LaVey. LaVey founded the Church of Satan in 1966 to cash in on the occult craze of the 1960's. LaVey's philosophy is one of hedonism and "free love" (hardly news for the 60's), and featured rituals with his nude wife and bare breasted female followers, which shows why males would want to join...even at the cost of $20 per meeting back then. LaVey didn't live up to his claims nor did he follow his own creed. Even though Satanism eschews charity of any kind, LaVey and his family lived on welfare and handouts during the late 70s-80s. Even though LaVey claimed Satanic magic could give "mastery of the earth", he still died bankrupt in a house he didn't own. LaVey lied about his accomplishments in life (i.e., an oboist for an orchestra, lion tamer, criminologist, etc.)and was in fact, just a high school dropout. While LaVey claimed he tried to "keep the nuts out" and disavowed criminal activity within his Satanic church, he admitted in several writings of engaging in a "cannibal feast" and forced females followers into prostitution...beating them when they did not bring back enough money. In the 1980s his common law wife Diane left him and sued, claiming LaVey beat her all during their relationship, which is confirmed by LaVey's children. LaVey claimed Satanists did not believe in harming children but according to his daughter Zeena, he was the passive witness to the molestation of his grandson Stanton, by a Church of Satan member. LaVey would reverse himself on many issues over the years. At first, the church of Satan welcomed gays and lesbians, but when LaVey saw the only people he could attract were mostly Neo-Nazis, his later writings gave hints of racism and of being anti-gay. After his death, the truth about him came out, but people still plunk down $7.95 for his "Satanic Bible", which is mostly plagiarized from other sources (Atlas Shrugged, Might Is Right, and the writings of Aleister Crowley) . <br>  <br>  If you want to be a bankrupt pimp, cannibal, wife beater, and liar, perhaps Satanism is for you!|`|9yLTvbgraa	I didn't read this but, this is what I found. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.versionist.com/provocative-heathens-secular/474-satanic-bible-book-review-pt-1-a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.versionist.com/provocative-he...</a>|`|AA10452279	Try a Google image search.

Debido a que todo esto ha sido tradición humana y habiéndose apartado por completo de la verdad , ahora se encuentra la religión con una posición incómoda con respecto al limbo. El artículo que te envío esclarece el origen del limbo, las consecuencias y el porqué no tiene base biblica.<br>  ?Debe usted bautizar a su bebé?<br>  <br>  El bebé difícilmente parece un pecador. Sin embargo, el propósito de este antiguo rito consiste en lavarle de sus pecados. El padrino renuncia tres veces a Satanás y sus obras. Luego, el sacerdote toma una peque?a vasija y derrama agua tres veces sobre la cabeza del ni?o, diciendo: “Yo te bautizo en el nombre del Padre y del Hijo y del Espíritu Santo”.<br>  <br>  POR casi dos milenios se ha bautizado a los infantes según esta ceremonia. Puede ser que los padres consideren que es una experiencia profundamente conmovedora. Sin embargo, ?se origina esta práctica de la Palabra de Dios? Los teólogos católicos reconocen que no. (Véase la New Catholic Encyclopedia, tomo?2, página?69.)<br>  <br>  Sírvase leer el libro bíblico de los Hechos e inmediatamente verá que entre los cristianos primitivos se bautizaba a los que podían ‘oír y prestar atención’ con entendimiento y ‘arrepentirse’. (Hechos 2:14, 22, 38,?41, Nácar-Colunga.) ?Estas son cosas que un bebé difícilmente podría hacer! Es cierto que la Biblia menciona a familias enteras, como la casa de Cornelio, que se bautizaron. Pero aun en tales casos, el bautismo se ofreció a quienes “oían la palabra”, no a los infantes. (Hechos 10:44-47.)<br>  <br>  ?Una tradición de Dios o de los hombres?<br>  <br>  El Vaticano, al ser incapaz de apoyarse en un precedente bíblico, dice: “Se considera que la práctica del bautismo de infantes obedece a una norma cuya tradición es inmemorial”. ?Estableció Jesucristo esa tradición? No, porque el bautismo de infantes no llegó a ser una práctica popular sino hasta algún tiempo después de la muerte de los apóstoles. Hacia fines del siglo segundo, uno de los padres de la iglesia, Tertuliano, dijo: “Dejen que [los ni?os] se hagan cristianos cuando puedan llegar a conocer a Cristo”.<br>  <br>  No obstante, el apóstol Pablo advirtió que vendría un tiempo “en que la gente no soportará la doctrina sana”. (2?Timoteo 4:3, Nueva Biblia Espa?ola, edición Latinoamericana.) Después que murieron los apóstoles, no pudiendo obrar ya “como restricción”, se empezaron a introducir en la adoración cristiana prácticas que no tenían respaldo bíblico. (2?Tesalonicenses 2:6.) Entre estas estaba el bautismo de infantes. Pero esta práctica no llegó a ser norma sino hasta el quinto siglo. En aquella época tuvo lugar un fiero debate que transformó para siempre la fisonomía de la cristiandad.<br>  <br>  Todo empezó cuando un monje de origen británico llamado Pelagio hizo un viaje a Roma. Horrorizado por la corrupción que vio entre los llamados cristianos, el clérigo se propuso incitar a los hombres hacia un “esfuerzo más moral”. Pelagio decía que el hombre no podía disculpar sus debilidades con el ‘pecado original’. “Todo bien o todo mal?[...] lo hacemos nosotros, no nace con nosotros.” El pelagianismo pronto llegó a estar en boca de la cristiandad.<br>  <br>  Pero no por mucho tiempo. Los líderes eclesiásticos interpretaron el abandono del concepto del ‘pecado original’ como una herejía. Pero, inconscientemente, Pelagio les hizo el juego al favorecer lo que para entonces era una costumbre popular: el bautismo de infantes. Agustín, uno de los padres de la iglesia, vio en esta postura de Pelagio una inconsecuencia manifiesta. Arguyó que, ‘si los infantes deben ser bautizados, ?qué ocurrirá con los que no han sido bautizados?’. La conclusión aparentemente lógica fue que tales ni?os sufrirían el fuego del infierno por no haber sido bautizados. Establecida esta premisa, Agustín propinó el golpe mortal: Siendo que los infantes no bautizados sufrirían condenación, ?qué otra razón explicaría la causa de esa condenación sino el ‘pecado original’?<br>  <br>  La doctrina de Pelagio se derrumbó. Posteriormente, un concilio de la iglesia, celebrado en Cartago, declaró heréticas las ense?anzas de Pelagio. La doctrina del ‘pecado original’ llegó a ser tan católica como el confesionario. La iglesia estaba ahora encaminada hacia la promoción de conversiones masivas —a menudo forzadas— para salvar a la gente del ‘fuego del infierno’. El bautismo de infantes pasó de ser una costumbre popular a un instrumento oficial de salvación, un instrumento que el protestantismo heredaría.<br>  <br>  ‘Al borde del infierno’<br>  <br>  La doctrina de Agustín suscitó algunas preguntas que, por su dificultad, resultaban embarazosas: ?Cómo podría un Dios de amor hacer que bebés inocentes sufrieran en el infierno? ?Es que iban a sufrir el mismo castigo que pecadores empedernidos los bebés que no habían sido bautizados? Responder a estas preguntas no ha sido nada fácil para los teólogos. El sacerdote católico Vincent Wilkin dice: “Algunos han entregado a los bebés no bautizados a la furia incontenible de las llamas del infierno; otros han creído que no es que las llamas del infierno les fuesen a consumir, sino que serían calentados a una temperatura verdaderamente incómoda de soportar; aún otros han dicho que la incomodidad que sufrirían en el infierno sería la más mínima posible?[...] mientras que hay quienes los colocarían en un paraíso terrestre”.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, la teoría más popular de todas ha sido la que afirma que las almas de los bebés no bautizados se recogen en el limbo. Esta palabra literalmente significa “el borde de una cosa” (como el borde, o dobladillo, de un vestido), y se alude con ella a una región que, supuestamente, está en las inmediaciones o al borde del infierno. El limbo para los teólogos es un concepto muy conveniente. Al menos, suaviza la imagen horrible de ni?os que están siendo atormentados.<br>  <br>  Como toda teoría hecha por el hombre, el concepto del limbo tiene sus dificultades. ?Por qué no se menciona en las Escrituras? ?Pueden los bebés salir del limbo? Y, después de todo, ?por qué tienen que ir ni?os inocentes a un lugar como ese? Es de entender que la iglesia insista en que el concepto del limbo “no es una ense?anza oficial de la Iglesia Católica”. (New Catholic Encyclopedia.)<br>  <br>  El debate se aviva de nuevo<br>  <br>  A través de los siglos, los católicos se adhirieron a los puntos de vista agustinianos e hicieron bautizar a sus hijos como un medio de protección ‘antilimbo’. Pero, desde la década de los cincuenta ha habido un reavivamiento dramático en cuanto al debatido tema del bautismo de infantes. Escriturarios católicos han expresado serias dudas acerca del fundamento bíblico para esta práctica. Otros han dicho que no pueden aceptar ni el concepto agustiniano sobre el infierno ni el limbo.<br>  <br>  Al principio, los líderes eclesiásticos conservadores rehusaron ceder. En?1951 el papa Pío?XII dirigió la palabra a un grupo de comadronas. Reafirmó la creencia de que “el estado de gracia al momento de la muerte es absolutamente necesario para la salvación”, y animó a las comadronas a efectuar el rito del bautismo por sí mismas, si al ayudar a dar a luz veían que el recién nacido estaba en peligro de muerte. Las instó, diciendo: “No dejen de realizar este servicio caritativo”. En?1958, y en términos parecidos, el Vaticano promulgó una seria advertencia que decía: “Los bebés deben ser bautizados lo antes posible”.<br>  <br>  No obstante, después del famoso concilio Vaticano?II, estalló de nuevo la controversia. En una operación inesperada, la iglesia trató de conciliar ambas posiciones, la conservadora y la liberal. El concilio afirmó que ‘el bautismo es absolutamente necesario para la salvación’. Aunque, curiosamente, dijo que la salvación también era posible para aquellos que “si no conocían el evangelio de Cristo, no era por alguna causa imputable a ellos”.<br>  <br>  En consecuencia, la iglesia entonces revisó el rito del bautismo de infantes. Entre otras cosas, un sacerdote tendría la opción de rehusar bautizar a un ni?o si los padres no se comprometían a educarlo como católico. ?Se había apartado por fin la iglesia de la doctrina agustiniana? Hubo quienes pensaron que sí y empezaron a poner en tela de juicio la necesidad del bautismo de infantes.<br>  <br>  Entonces, el Vaticano promulgó las “Normas para el bautismo de infantes”, en las que dice: “La Iglesia?[...] no sabe de otro camino, aparte del bautismo, que garantice la entrada de los ni?os a la felicidad eterna”. A los obispos se les instruyó que “trajeran de vuelta a las prácticas tradicionales a quienes?[...] se habían apartado de ellas”. Pero, ?y los bebés que habían muerto sin bautizarse? “Lo único que puede hacer la Iglesia es encomendarlos a la misericordia de Dios.”<br>  <br>  Su hijo y el bautismo de infantes<br>  <br>  Sin duda, hay muchos católicos sinceros que están verdaderamente perplejos por todo esto. Y quizás haya otros que piensen que, a pesar de lo que la doctrina católica diga, el bautismo al menos le da al ni?o un buen comienzo en sentido religioso. ?Es esto cierto? Una madre católica dijo: “Tengo dos hijos muy jóvenes, ambos bautizados de peque?os, y no veo en ellos una pizca de gracia divina. De hecho, es todo lo contrario”.<br>  <br>  El que se bautice a un bebé no contribuye a que él se desarrolle en la fe. Esto es en sí una violación del mandato de Jesús: “Vayan, por lo tanto, y hagan discípulos [o, “hagan aprendices”]?[...] bautizándolos”. (Mateo 28:19.) El bautismo no tiene significado alguno si la persona no tiene edad suficiente para ser un discípulo. Es cierto que existe una ‘tradición inmemorial’ en apoyo del bautismo de infantes. Pero, ?no condenó Jesús a quienes ‘invalidaban la palabra de Dios a causa de sus tradiciones’? (Mateo 15:6.)<br>  <br>  Por consiguiente, la Biblia anima a los padres a entrenar a los hijos “desde la infancia” en las cosas espirituales. (2?Timoteo 3:14-17.) En armonía con esto, los testigos de Jehová toman a pecho el consejo bíblico de criar a los hijos “en la disciplina y regulación mental de Jehová”. (Efesios 6:4.) Por lo general, esto se lleva a cabo por medio de un programa de estudio bíblico de familia. Los padres ense?an a sus hijos a asistir y participar en las reuniones cristianas. (Hebreos 10:24,?25.) Les animan a hacer “declaración pública” de su fe. (Romanos 10:10.) Con el tiempo, sus hijos estarán en posición de hacer su propia dedicación a Jehová Dios, simbolizando dicha dedicación por medio del bautismo en agua. Este procedimiento tiene base bíblica y es mucho más significativo y satisfaciente que presenciar el rito formal por el que se hace pasar a un bebé que es incapaz de comprender lo que sucede.<br>  <br>  Si el hijo de unos padres cristianos muriera antes de bautizarse, sus padres no tendrían por qué temer que el ni?o arda en las llamas del infierno o vague por el limbo. La Biblia ense?a que los muertos están inconscientes. (Eclesiastés 9:5,?10.) Los padres cristianos hallan consuelo en la promesa de Jesús cuando dijo que “viene la hora en que todos los que están en las tumbas conmemorativas oirán su voz y saldrán”, con la perspectiva de vida en el Paraíso restaurado. (Juan 5:28,?29; Lucas 23:43.) Esta esperanza, que se basa en la Biblia, tiene un efecto mucho más consolador que las cambiantes y confusas tradiciones humanas|`|bbttBTjWaa	Y que carajooo importa el limbo, tengo demasiados problemas para preocuparme antes que de si un un gordo vestido de blanco elimino un lugar que ni se si existe!|`|c3NQzfOlaa	quien lo puede hacer ...solo dios... eso digo yo....|`|cqG61u8Taa	no se puede eliminer algo que nunca existio porque segun los catolicos el limbo es la marada de los muertos cuyas almas estan excluidas del cielo por faltas que son suya  pues claro de quien van hacer esas faltas si no dde cada quien  nadie va a pagar por faltas ajenas  verdad  solo que no tiene logica lo de el limbo ahora la biblia claramente lo dice que al morir tu entras en un estado de inconciencia que tu ya no sabes lo que pasa contigo  ni con las personas que se quedad aqui en la tierra  eso de limbo lo inventaron los altos clericos para asustar ala gente y siempre tenerle la pata en el pescuezo hay perdo es en el cuello|`|fJx8A1j2aa	?

The lesson that one action is benevolent or malevolent to oneself and others. Or that a certain benevolent action is pleasing to the divine.<br>  <br>  What other people ( believers or heathens ) choose... whether it is right or wrong in OUR eyes.... if God and his angels don't stop such an act, what right have we to interfere? We as friends/family/loved ones of course can only do our best to advise for or against an action, but here is where TOLERENCE comes into play, to allow the individual to make their own choice, learn their own lessons and advance spiritually in their own time and way<br>  <br>  Neither the Bible nor the Quran, even the Hindu scriptures nor the Buddhist Sutras, Shastras and Tantras...NOT even the Taoist classics say that we are to be MEDDLESOME in the lives of others...

What most people don't realize is that by restricting the rights of certain groups, we aren't ensuring our own rights.  If we restrict the rights of homosexuals and we set that precedent, what's to stop a different leader from restricting the rights of heterosexuals in the future?  If we make a law preventing any Wiccans from practicing their beliefs, what's to stop another leader from making that same law in reference to Christians?  To protect the rights of others is to protect your own, also. <br>  <br>  Personally, I hope that God is happy in the way I follow his commandment to "love my neighbors".  I'm never rude or condemning of anyone because of their race, religion, sexual orientation ... any group that they might fit in.  <br>  <br>  We are all humans, and we all deserve the same basic rights and respect.

If we can do something unique with it, yeah, but it is really an early exploration of that in my head...I'm thinking 'how can we incorporate this without damaging what happens in the game -- without having it feel silly -- where it's just like we threw two Kratoses in there and now you can run around through the world.'

The passage regarding food is clearly regarding *permanent* prohibition of certain foods - i.e. Jewish dietary laws.  Notice also the word "forbid".  Clearly, it is NOT a sin to voluntarily adopt Jewish dietary practices.  It is only a sin to insist that it is a prerequisite of Christianity (as addressed in Acts 15).<br>  <br>  The same applies to "forbidding marriage".  The Roman Catholic Church certainly does NOT forbid marriage!  However, anyone who *voluntarily* chooses not to marry - and promises not to marry - is allowed to do so.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|z74a7wvlaa	The first christians were catholic.<br>  St Paul was instructing Timothy, 1st bishop of Ephesus, regarding the duties of the bishop; esp good morals on candidates; <br>  Duoauy Rheims version: 1 Tim 4: 1-4<br>  1 Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the last times some will turn away from the faith by paying attention to deceitful spirits and demonic instructions <br>  2 through the hypocrisy of liars with branded consciences. <br>  3 They forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. <br>  4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected when received with thanksgiving, <br>  Notes: [1-5] Doctrinal deviations from the true Christian message within the church have been prophesied, though the origin of the prophecy is not specified (1 Tim 4:1-2); cf Acts 20:29-30. The letter warns against a false asceticism that prohibits marriage and regards certain foods as forbidden, though they are part of God's good creation (1 Tim 4:3). It refers to the gnostics, the marcionites, the manicheans, etc who condemned marriage and use of all kinds of meats; cus they pretended that all flesh was from an evil principle. <br>  <br>  Conclusions: St paul cannot be against his own religion, catholicism.|`|K2nbcyKSaa	1 Timothy 4:2 <br>  I think that you are sinning by shooting out the lip and not even thinking things through thoroughly. We need to study railing and learn to think. It is not fair to anyone to condemn Catholics who Christ died for. What is your angle and do you worship God that is in you and desires to be a part of your life.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	No.  Did you know that the Bible came from the Catholic Church?<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|AA10239241	Nope.  First of all, look again....it is not Timothy who is writing -- it is Paul's letter TO Timothy and he is giving Timothy advice.   Taken in proper context (rather than reading into it something that is not there), Paul is advising timothy about those in the church who are following the false teachers (Judaizers and gnostics) who come around and are unqualified in their teaching.  We, the readers, are merely peering over Timothy's shoulder as he reads this.  <br>  <br>  So...if you can't even determine that it is not Timothy who is the one who has written this, shouldn't you brush up on the biblical basics?  The letter is rightfully called "the First Letter OF Paul TO Timothy"....how can you then claim that Timothy wrote it?  <br>  <br>  We just dicussed this at our Bible study the other night...how many Protestants just focus on what they want to and forget about reading the text within its prper context?  They are more about eisegesis (making the text say what they want it to say) rather than exegesis -- what is actually says!|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	The Catholic Church considers marriage a sacrament - an efficacious sign, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church by which God shares His divine life with us.  How can you say that the Catholic Church forbids marriage when we consider it a sacrament.  <br>  <br>  Catholics abstain from meat on Fridays not because we do not see meat as good but as a practice of self-sacrifice similar to the way Jesus fasted.  Are you saying that Paul is criticizing Jesus for fasting?|`|pjYn6PbCaa	The scripture addresses the contentious man as well and say's we should avoid him.

8cb8912fd33cd93322ea14941b07b1f3aa	Apart from philosophyangel, you've so far received a lot of uninformed and unkind answers. <br>  <br>  There are many meditative techniques and many different experiences that can come up doing any one of them, especially if you have been meditating for a relatively short time.<br>  <br>  I've done meditation a long time. My advice would be that you not get too attached to any particular experience that might come up, to take what comes with a kind of attentive acceptance and to let it go again. <br>  <br>  I would also recommend continuing to learn more about meditation, and to consider finding a center or meditation teacher where you can ask questions and get feedback.<br>  .|`|SsB7aRExaa	A state of deception.

This is what meditation is supposed to feel like: the mind is calm and clear and a feeling of "luminousness" or "expansiveness';may be present, the body is in a proper posture but is relaxed and the mind is detached from the body so that you may feel like you can't move or open your eyes ( but you can). In very deep states of meditation, you may seem to completely lose the sense of yourself and be absorbed in a nondual state. This is different from being asleep or not conscious and it is not that common (except in very advanced meditators). You will not get "lost" in these states. They are self-limited. You naturally come out of them back to normal consciousness.<br>  <br>  There is a stage of meditation that occurs for some people in which they feel energetic movement in the body and the body may move. Movement may include glossolalia, or affective symptoms such as laughing or crying.  This occurs in esoteric forms of Tantric meditative practice, although some Tantric groups discourage it. It is believed to be the movement of prana or kundalini that is working through psychodynamic blockages. the same phenomenon occurs in shamanic mysticism and it infact occurs in Pentecostal type Christianity.   It may have a root in neurological and psychiatric processes since the movements can resemble epileptic or moreso, psychogenic seizure activity. When the activity occurs during meditation  or in the context of a spiritual practice (such as with Pentecostals) it is usually controlled and self-limited, and has a beneficial effect on the practitioner; when it occurs in other contexts in non-meditators, it is often a sign of pathology.

Ask her opinion. And if she doesn't want to do team work let her know that you really appreciated all the input she can bring to the job, so she can feel you are there to do your job, not to steal hers. Good luck.|`|paerqxfMaa	She could be insecure, she could be going through something in her personal life.  Don't take it personally, just bide your time.  Once things settle down for her - either in her personal life, or once she realizes that you are not out for her job (in this economy, everyone is a little paranoid) - she may turn around.<br>  My friends and I have come up with a thing when we have to ask somebody for something that they may not want to do, we always compliment them on "how nice that color looks on you" or "what a nice blouse/outfit, etc. you have on" - we laugh because now it's become our catchphrase among ourselves - but be very careful, in this time of sexual harassment, you don't want your compliment to come off wrong - you can always just be cheerful and say something like "and how are you on this beautiful day".

o8TGZ8szaa	Abbastanza complicato, ma provo a spiegarti...si tratta di slang, linguaggio da strada, prevalentemente americano ma usato anche in UK. Shizzle ha due significati: "sure" (sicuro) o "****" (m***a, ma anche qualcosa di terribilmente bello). Rizzle significa "real", vero, reale. In questo caso "the shizzle fo' rizzle" potrebbe essere traslitterato in inglese comune come "the **** for real", il cui significato equivale a " (è) una cosa davvero bellissima/avanti/ è davvero una figata/ grandioso!"

Afro-Mexicans do exist.<br>  <br>  i do spend time in the Houston area and have not encountered any situations like that.<br>  <br>  All that it counts that theres love between you, your significant of other and your child. Don't worry about the rest of the world.|`|7ea0f535da29e086ec521fc829e3bb33aa	Don't generalize all Mexican people, just because your husband's family does not want to accept your child.|`|ix6DrRJjaa	Not many Blacks live in Mexico. They were probably all chased away, or more to the point, the Mexicans themselves were the slaves, so no one saw any need to import Africans. They paid a huge price not to have to live amongst Blacks, and were thus thankfully spared the horrible social disorder that we have over Black/ and White. Then they come to America and there it is.<br>      If you really want to try, you can probably win them over somewhat, but don't ever expect them to treat you  like they are colorblind. They probably have enough problems not to deserve having you thrown into the mix as well. How I'd see it anyway.|`|3NyntyI0aa	I was watching Tyra the other day, and they had different women of culture on there and each one was explaining about their thoughts on women of another culture:<br>  <br>  For instance the woman of color was giving her thoughts on the white woman, the Asian woman, etc..    Sadly, it was an equal consensus through all of the panel guests that when you are of a mixed race (regardless) and your skin happens to be darker then what is socially acceptable, that you tend to not only get rejected by your own race, but by other races as well.<br>  <br>  My nieces are mixed (black and white) one niece is very dark brown- with ethnic hair, and the other is very light skinned with fine hair - and I can HONESTLY say that in public, the lighter skinned girl gets all of the attention, although to me the darker skinned girl has all of the personality...<br>  <br>  It's bad enough that your child will be exposed to experience racism from strangers, but when his own family doesn't want to accept your child because of the color of his skin, or his African American heritage - <br>  <br>  I'm sure that this will ruffle some feathers, but I have always thought that Mexicans, were very racist, even quick to separate themselves from Spainish (spain)- or Cuban, or Philipino... there is nothing wrong with beign proud of your heritage, until you hurt a childs feelings for having different heritages...|`|AAtIPOUAaa	Any thinking adult that does not love a grandchild unconditionally, their own flesh and blood, has problems deeper than racial issues.<br>  Bless the innocent child.

Imagine you have an electronic device, how are you gonna use it without a manual. The same thing here, we believe that Allah (God) who created us gave us the manual (The holy Quran) as a guide on how to behave in this life, it contains not only spiritual beliefs and set of moral structure but a legal system as well which is very similar to the OT but with a broader horizin.<br>  <br>  remember that prophet Jesus (Peace be upon him) was a spiritual leader ONLY, he didn't set any laws.

That information is public record.<br>  <br>  There are usually laws about animals and also disturbing the peace. Most places have specific ordinances about dog barking and howling. A lot of times you need a petition (a couple other neighbors to sign) or you need proof. Video evidence with sound is going to be the best way to prove it to the county or city.<br>  <br>  If you live in apartments or condos, or if the neighbors are renters, you can also go through the apartment manager, condo association or home's landlord. The last one is kind of a longshot, though.<br>  <br>  I linked a site that has some info from California. There are other link on the site to some specific incidents and ordinances from various places. You have to scroll down a ways to find them.<br>  <br>  I also linked specifics from the ordinances in King County, Washington (Seattle area) which has some easy to understand guidelines, although every city and county will have different codes.

Chaque renaissance, dit-on, ramène l’individu dans le même système de choses, où il subira de nouvelles souffrances et finalement la mort. Le cycle des renaissances serait virtuellement sans fin. Est-ce vraiment ce qui vous attend? Certains croient que la seule fa?on d’échapper à ce cycle consiste à faire taire tout désir pour les plaisirs physiques. Dans quoi se réfugient-ils? Dans ce que d’aucuns qualifient de vie inconsciente.<br>  <br>  Je crois dans la Bible: D’après la Bible, l’ame est la personne tout entière. Même à celui qui a pratiqué le mal par le passé, pour peu qu’il se repente et change de mode de vie, Jéhovah fait miséricorde (Ps. 103:12, 13). Rien ne survit à la mort de l’individu. La mort ressemble à un sommeil profond et sans rêves. Toutefois, il y aura une résurrection. Différente de la réincarnation, la résurrection est le retour à l’existence de la même personnalité (Actes 24:15). La plupart des humains jouiront d’une résurrection terrestre.

And not too many people have the stomach to do it.<br>  <br>  So please, show me your source.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	Hunting is a minority activity which is perceived, these days, as something that only "privileged" or "rich" people participate in. There seems to be a level of envy involved in its condemnation.<br>  As to butchery, most people are meat eaters, and I cannot see, nor have I heard of, any denigration of butchers. <br>  I do know 2 butchers.<br>  Both have been working in that trade for many years. Neither dislikes their job, and neither is a serial killer, unintelligent, criminal, grim or ugly.<br>  IT and office work are, comparatively, easy skills to learn and there is a high demand for people with those skills. That is why they are promoted at careers fairs and in schools. Careers officers do not like to be faced with awkward choices like "I would really like to be a bee keeper" - such a preference would require them to do some hard work.<br>  For myself, I have no problem with butchering a carcass but am not allowed to do so, legally, because regulations say I cannot. I am a meat eater, make no apology for it, and, if it were needed, would be more than content to butcher any animal you might bring to me for my consumption. Heck, I'd even let you have anything that was surplus to my needs.<br>  As it is, I go to my butcher for my meat, and he does a very good job.|`|9EgXeA2waa	I believe animals should be killed for eating.. its nature<br>  <br>  BUT<br>  <br>  i want the animals i eat to have a long joyful life.. it sounds weird but slaughtering is cruel because theyre are innocent but without meat it would be hard to find protein etc.<br>  its proven that meat eaters are healthier then vegetarians!!!|`|PsWzUuTtaa	So what? It is not a pleasant thing, slaughtering any life is not a pleasant thing but apparently you're either a kid or a very naive person. This world is built on an arbitrary foundation in which things are frowned upon but relativism prevails (more so now than ever). Slaughtering of human beings is the greatest of all "sins" yet we praise soldiers for murdering for the cause of freedom, love of one's country etc. I won't even go into the hypocrisy of religion since a lot of people here apparently know about them. The same thing is with hunting and the slaughtering of animals. It is disgusting and out right unethical but because of the way in which the world is structured, opposing this in any absolute way is impractical.<br>  <br>  Hey the person above me: Where did you get ur information from loll. Meat eaters have the highest cancer rates and cholosterol and heart disease levels in America. I'd love to see your source.
zJXCbrjyaa	Is she actually gay? If she is:<br>  1) Let her know that you support her, and that there is nothing wrong with her sexuality. <br>  2) Stand up for her whenever you see people harassing her. Let other people know that you think it's unacceptable for people to be treated that way.<br>  3) Let a teacher, counselor, principal, or someone like that know what is happening. It's not acceptable.<br>  4) If the school won't do anything, try contacting an organisation like PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) for some advice. I've added the link below.<br>  <br>  If she ISN'T gay, try steps 2 and 3.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!<br>  |`|SfYMpnEnaa	I don't want to be a downer, but sometimes administrations don't do a lot... on anything really... sometimes students and parents go to principals and they don't do ****... I mean, they refer you to someone else to solve the problem. Just keep searching for someone that actually pays attention and have interest in the issue.<br>  Also, schools aren't always the best people to go to about gay/lesbian issues. Because my friend Jaron wanted to bring his boyfriend to the freshman semi-formal and he asked the administration and they denied it, he didn't say why but that pissed me off... but I read somewhere else that this girl fought to bring her girlfriend to the prom at her high school and won, so it's possible to gain attention...<br>  And another thing, yeah, we have harrasment at our school... but it's not violent... and even verbal is apparent, but not really heard of. And at our school the senior/upperclassmen horror stories are just myths. We don't have senior jocks throwing kids into trash cans and we don't have people getting stuffed into lockers...mostly because they're too small and jampacked with books and binders and stuff. So... yeah...but we did have a bf and gf get caught having sex in the library once last year... and I didn't see it, but I knew the person and it did happen. And they got suspended for it. I mean, at least do it when no one is there, or somewhere you won't get caught, I mean seriously...<br>  And the horror stories you see on tv about the goths getting harassed, and people doing drugs in bathrooms, and cutters in the bathroom... doing you know what... we don't have that here... we have a resource officer with a drug dog and our drug rate has gone down noticeably. But as for weapons and knives... we don't have metal detectors, because only a few kids (meaning less than 20) are actually stupid enough to bring knives and razors to school... And we have over 1500 students at my school.<br>  <br>  Totally got off topic, but... mostly pay attention to the beginning... that's my answer.|`|4sVB0efkaa	Well stand up for her...but don't resort to violence, you don't want to be as low as them...Tell the high school principle, or someone like that, and they'll take proper action.|`|vvgmyX04aa	OK, if the harassment has gone to the point where it's physical violence, it's at the point that the school administration needs to be made aware of the situation. This is not At All aceptable in school, and your friend deserves to be safe!<br>  <br>  Here's what I would do. I would first ask my friend if she wants to talk to the principal about what is going on and offer to go with her for support. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't want to go, that's understandable but not good because it is best if the principal is told of specific things from someone who is dealing with them. Try to talk to her and tell her that it will Not get better if she keeps quiet about it and she has 4 years of this hell.<br>  <br>  But no matter what, you can make an appointment with a counselor or the principal and tell them what is going on. But they have to be told about what is happening because it is their responsibility. Then it's on Them to deal with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If she is in a seperate part of the school, that sucks because it's hard to have her back but try to tell your friends what's going on and ask them to look out for her when and where they can. You know, like at lunch time and after school. That way it's you And your friends sticking by her.<br>  <br>  <br>  But again, this is harasment and violence and it is something for the school administration. If it doesn't look like they are doing anything about it, then take it to the school board.  <br>  <br>  Good luck. Please feel free to email me if you like. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|2XQstX3xaa	Damn, that sucks big time. It's great that she has you to be her support while all these closed minded *** h*les tease and hurt her. Always be there to lift her up after they've torn her down. Since it's gone as far as physical violence I'd go to an authority figure first and if it doesn't stop. I'd teach her how to fight a little and watch out for them teasing her and then both of you just kick the s*it out of them. I've always been very much against violence but my sister taught me that sometimes that's all that will help. I had three guys tease me at school and I did what my sister said and just went totally crazy on them screaming and punching and clawing, it scared the crap outta me but they never even looked at me again. I only did this after teachers didn't step in to help. I got into trouble at school but it didn't last long but the peach and confidence I got from it did. My dad and my sister where both very proud that I stood up to myself. I'm not saying fighting will solve everything but it will show them that they don't have the right to touch her anytime they want. That's just wrong and if I ever saw it I'd kick there tails myself.|`|rl0Zq1gvaa	You may want to include whether you are a boy or a girl. The advice would be different depending upon whether she is a victim of prejudice because she IS a lesbian, or whether she's just the victim of stupid teenagers calling her names even though she's straight.|`|aQEwfIRWaa	it seems like the only thing you can do is tell the principal or a teacher..it could help, or it could lead to more harassing. if it gets much worse, you could sue|`|7QtYINwFaa	If you see any of the people that did this to her, beat the crap out of them.<br>  <br>  It's about time we of the LGBT community grew a pair.

Are. @$$HOLES!!! and this is my own grade.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it's verbal harassment like what i get [*shrugs*], i'd encourage her, but it's not something to 'tell' about, ya know?<br>  PHYSICAL like that though, TELL THE PRINCIPAL. you don't have to tell her you're her girlfriend, or that's she's even bi. because kids will harass for no reason.|`|Fu4yKd5aaa	it is horrible but it is reality there is not much you can do about it but talk to her she should stand up for herself ya know she should be proud of who she is|`|kK9peR4Iaa	She needs to tell someone, or you need to. It's one thing is the harassment is verbal but it's become physical so the legal system/school needs to step in.
m9LNP93jaa	Hahahaha, that is perfectly normal for your age. Unfortunately there is no way to stop it. Your body is going through normal hormonal changes and they won't stop for a while yet. The only thing that I can think of that MIGHT help is if you masturbated before going to school to relieve sexual energy before you got to school. Now, I have heard no research to support this but it is just a thought, I mean it makes sense. If you have less sexual energy when you go to school then when things like that happen you will be less aroused. Maybe relieving sexual tension after school so you don't carry over so much to the next day? I'm shooting in the barrel I'm just not sure there's any fish. |`|bYXz6xJcaa	I think you are lucky to be out and feel free.  I admire that.

At first I got caught starting and i complimented her on her undergarments then i became aware that i couldn't stop looking at her and that no one would understand so I started telling everyone that it was agents my religion to show anyone my bare skin out of wedlock so that i could go dress alone and not be the pervert that stares at my friends boobs and butt.|`|2a31fdee1fddb6a3055ca7fae75fc902aa	*edit*<br>  <br>  Don't be ashamed, it happens to all of us.

Reportedly, Villa had purchased firearms but on receiving them, discovered that the weapons were outdated and not what he had paid for. Villa gave the dealers the choices of refunding his money or giving him the weapons he had bought.<br>  <br>  Others believe that the raid was conducted because of the U.S. government's official recognition of the Carranza regime and for the loss of lives in battle due to defective bullets purchased from the United States.[6] They attacked a detachment of the 13th US Cavalry, confiscated 100 horses and mules, set the whole town on fire, and killed 84 persons. This was the second time U.S. land was attacked by another country. Pancho Villa's righthand men Charlie McEvoy and Ari Najarian infiltrated all of the enemies' ports and were key in his raids across the land.

zPfgFXU5aa	The way it worked in Biblical times was: <br>  <br>  The parents, or a confidential friend, of the bridegroom chose the bride (Gen. 24; 21:21; 38:6). <br>  <br>  The parents' consent was asked first, then that of the bride (Gen. 24:58). T<br>  <br>  he presents (dowry) to the bride and/or her parents are called "mohar", those to the relatives "mattan." The dowry could take the form of service instead of material goods (Gen. 29; 1 Sam 18:25). <br>  <br>  Between betrothal (engagement) and marriage all communication between the couple was carried on through "the friend of the bridegroom" (John 3:29). <br>  <br>  They were considered to be married to a degree, so that being unfaithful was punishable by death (Deut. 22:23-24) — as it was for any marital unfaithfulness, but they were not yet living or sleeping together.<br>  <br>  If the bridegroom did not want to go through with the marriage, he could divorce her ("put her away") by a bill of divorcement (Deut. 24:1; Matt. 1:19). <br>  <br>  No formal religious ceremony completed  the wedding; but a blessing was pronounced, and a "covenant of God" entered into (Ezek. 16:8; Mal 2:14; Prov. 2:17; Gen. 24:60; Ruth 4:11-12). <br>  <br>  The essential and distinguishing part of the ceremony that made the couple fully married was the taking of the bride from her father's house to that of the bridegroom or his father  followed by consumation of the marriage.<br>  <br>  Joseph had not taken Mary from her father's house at the time the Angel Gabriel visited Mary and, as the Gospels record, Joseph wanted to cancel the engagement as he thought she had been unfaithfull,  but agreed to go ahead with the marriage when God revealed the truth to him in a vision.|`|Jyxi74x0aa	She was betrothed, not married. At the time betrothals were taken very seriously, which is why Joseph spoke of divorcing her. To break a betrothal was considered divorce. But the marriage was not complete yet so they were not permitted to consummate it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Fathers would sometimes arrange marriages, but this is interesting--the woman was allowed to refuse the offer. She was given a cup at the betrothal ceremony and if she drank from the cup her answer was yes. If she did not drink, the answer was no. Lots of pressure on the woman, but she had the final say.|`|cz4mpWucaa	Because the story-tellers back then weren't smart enough to realize that people in this era would be able to discern the inconsistencies in the story.<br>  <br>  She wasn't a virgin mate---hell, she might be myth too :)|`|DN2Qmikwaa	I see you've never been married sir.<br>  <br>  Speaking as a husband, if you want sex, marriage is the last thing you'll want to do.|`|AA11227341	whoa, did you forget?

Funny how you consider every other answer but the Catholic one, which makes the most sense.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	She was not completely married.  She and Joseph were engaged, promised to one another in other words, but had not yet come together.  He found out she was pregnant and was going to "put her away" in the words of the King James Version, which is the engagement version of divorce.  The system allowed for this because the assumption was that the bride would be a virgin on her wedding night and if she was pregnant, then she couldn't be a virgin, could she?  But then he had a dream that he should NOT set her aside, but should go ahead and marry her as planned.  He did this.  That's always how it was done in traditional societies.  Nobody just up and married somebody in settled areas.  There was always a lot of negotiation between families, because a woman didn't just pick go out on a date with a man back then.  There was no dating.  It was a property settlement between two families, normally between the parents (usually the fathers, that is) of the young couple.  The bride wasn't just marrying the groom, either.  She was entering his family, becoming one of them, in effect.  That's why there were things like dowries and bride price.  In the first of these, the bride is, in effect, getting her share of the inheritance when she leaves her father's house.  In the second, the groom is essentially compensating her father for the loss of his investment in this young woman for so many years.  He's losing the labor of a considerable portion of his family when she marries, you see.  So, there was always -- and still is -- a certain period of time during which it is understood that bride and groom are going to be married, and goods are going to be exchanged, but not all the property has yet changed hands and the ceremonies haven't yet all been performed.  Those ceremonies had to be done at the proper time, too.  You couldn't just run off to Vegas whenever you wanted!  No, the season has to be right, the priest had to be arranged for, etc., etc.  There was a lot of planning!  There still is, even in the Near East!|`|Q4SnXeQwaa	She was not married when Gabriel came to talk to her. She was betrothed. That is similar to an engagement.

Man disobeyed God and fell to the evil that came through the woman.  It's called original sin.  It's a weakness every man and woman come into the world with.  Every man that puts a woman on a pedestal worships her instead of his God, and that's the downfall of humanity.  Few have the spiritual maturity to see the game being played and the devil in the middle laughing up his sleeve.  The natural spiritual order should be God over Christ over man over woman.

She was created by God as a spouse for Adam so that they could live in the Garden together. They were warned not to approach a certain tree. This tree had a very sweet smell, the best in the carden, called qamh. Eve was tempted by Iblis, who had become her friend by his glib talking, to eat from the tree fruit. Only by eating its fruit, he told her, would she be able to have children. When Adam learned what she had done, he followed her example, though more hesitantly, because he knew she would be cast out of paradise and he wanted to protect her against the hard life on earth.<br>  <br>  Earth in those days was a bleak place, nothing but rock and thorn bushes. Eve learned to make a fire and to cook the food which Adam brought home: animals he had hunted (later they received cattle) and grain he had cultivated from which Eve baked bread.<br>  <br>  Eve gave birth to forty children, twenty sets of twins, each set a boy and a girl. Her eldest son Kabil (Cain) later slew his younger broter Abil (Abel). In this way Eve was punished for having eaten the forbidden fruit. <br>  <br>  In ancient Persian mythology|`|253e6b2bad99caee34d55cd7b6a38ec0aa	God created the universe  and man before Mythology was written.

We are all related this is a fact, regardless of your belief.<br>  <br>  I find it very sad that the most divisive comments are from the "followers" of God. <br>  <br>  In my belief Love is the whole of the Law.  All else is commentary.  To reject someone because you don't agree with them is never going to bring reconciliation and never bring them over to your way of thinking.  If you believe you are right shouldn't you reach out to others and try to help them see your side of the story instead of call them names (sinners) and cast them from you?  You will never get someone to listen if you start casting them into hell.  At least that's when I stop talking with the Christians, when they start telling me I'm going to some mythological place I don't even believe in.<br>  <br>  I send love and blessings to all, even if they don't agree with me.

Many faiths see His differently because of Traditions. But there is only one God.  I am Roman Catholic, a very strict religion. Yet myself and others I know are very open to learning about other faiths and we respect them all. We just aren't going to convert to them.  I don't ever put myself first. God is first, my son then, my parents, my brothers, my friends, and strangers all come before me. Of course I would believe everything Jesus did and said. It's part of my faith and now that I'm 35 & have read many books on my Catholic faith, I love my my faith and openly accept it. If I didn't, I would then probably convert to something else or leave God behind all together. It's a personal journey.  Homosexuals exists. They have been around since the biblical ages to present. Heck, they are all around me! I respect them as people. I just believe what God said about homosexuality because He is God and I would never tell God that He is wrong. I am female. I've never come 2nd to any man. If I have, then I've done it to my own accord. Adam was created first. Men are the dominant ones, 'king of their castle". If a woman doesn't like that, then don't marry him. But it was Jesus that selected His 12 apostles (all men) and Jesus selected Peter to be the head of the Church (a man). etc. It's in accord with the Holy Word of God. Many women are housewives and stay-at-home mothers and are completely happy with that role. I think it's a very important role in the family household. The man might bring home a paycheck and mow the yard, but it's usually the wife that keeps the family together. She is the glue that binds them all. Active homosexuals are active sinners. They can't become priests and still have an active gay sex life. That's be hypocritical of the Church and of God. Priests use to be married up until 400 yrs ago. The Pope is considering this to change sometime. Soon I hope, because many married men would love to serve the Lord and have a church and parishioners and still be a husband and father. I think this will change within the next 10 yrs. or less.  The Vatican is separate from outside laws. I believe it was the liberals that forced the church and state separation thing yrs ago. So that's why priests are punished within the Church and not outside the Church. Talk to the liberals on that on.  If you are no longer a Christian, then that means you no longer believe that Jesus is our Messiah, Son of God, second Godhead, our Redeemer and Saviour. I'm sorry you've changed your mind, but you have the right to do that.  It wasn't the Church that changed, it was you. Are God's laws too demanding on you?|`|AA11466759	Most Christians I meet are extremely loving, kind and accepting people.  They mind their own business and do not preach.  Their arms are always open and their generosity pours out from there.  There is always a joke, and everyone has respect for everyone else according to their station.  When you are around them, you feel balanced and ...free.  This is true of the Sikhs I've met, of the Muslims I've met, of the Buddhists I've met.|`|AA10253745	Not all of us.|`|AA11263795	Lets see if I can take this in order...<br>  1)Some christians are blind and unaccepting, those are called hypocrites.<br>  2)I am open to the idea of everyone having a right to "pick their own poison".<br>  3)homosexuals exist, they are sinning against God. But then again so are the rest of us almost as soon as we set foot on the floor in the morning. There is not one of us that is perfect, so homosexuals should not be judged or condemned for their sin, it will be between them and God. I simply do not want to hear about it 24 seven and be told I have to like it. Accept it I grant, like it I can't.<br>  4)Women are not 2nd. Obviously you have not read about Rachael, Mary, Elizabeth, Pricilla, Esther, etc. They were extremely influential women in both the Old and New Testaments.<br>  5)Times cannot change because God is the same today as He was yesterday  and will be tomorrow.<br>  6)Any pedophile should be in jail regardless of religious affiliation and should not be able to hid under the Pope's skirt.<br>  <br>  Okay....next question?|`|fa6688428d72c93b68f0eb0ad311f085aa	You are judging the whole group by  the deeds of a few.

We were out on a ranch outside just drinking when we (me and about 5 friends) saw this huge ball of light floating up over the horizon. I mean it was huge!! The size of the moon to the naked eye.

4a82252f380573f92eb2ac8bdbd8b46baa	Sì, è vero, non vi è nulla come la sofferenza che spinga l'uomo a guardare dentro di sé, svelando a se stesso il proprio sentimento e a trovare in esso consolazione e rifugio. Succede persino che qualcuno trovi così consolatorio questo sentimento intimo che gli piaccia dolcemente indugiare nella propria sofferenza. Ma succede anche che guardando dentro di sé scopra che non c'è nulla e allora scatta prorompente la più tremenda follia distruttiva che altro non è se non un grido di inconsolabile e disperatissimo dolore.|`|1343c0ed2a12055d6a533d44f2f1a4caaa	Non solo la sofferenza spinge a guardarsi dentro,mi sembra limitativo e leggermente masochista...Si può guardare dentro a se stessi senza passare sotto le forche del dolore,anche se è inconfutabile che quell'occasione aiuta l'avvicinamento.Personalmente spero di non arrivare a quello...|`|8PZ11adcaa	Credo le due cose siano complementari... una senza l'altra non porta da nessuna parte...|`|c2bcacc85f41a94aa996cf8a8d2dcddfaa	La frase di Kierkegaard è molto vera, l'introspezione è diversa dall'apprendimento sul mondo circostante e scaturisce quando l'uomo è sottoposto a stimoli di tipo negativo.

NWopkX4baa	Well, women would have the power if it wasn't for the devil! |`|W0rcm3awaa	If God exists:<br>  <br>  God doesn't need to reproduce - he is everything. We only refer to him as he because its generic not because he has a penis or because he is male. So technically speak God is neither he nor she.<br>  <br>  Also its not feminists who do that, its actually pagans - wiccans who refer to god as goddess. And its men and women who do that and actually most of the people who are feminists dont refer to god as female. I'm serious about this.<br>  <br>  Feminism is a movement for equality between the sexes not 'women are better than men' or 'women who hate men' there are a lot of male feminists. I'm not saying there aren't a few who hate men or think women are better, but overall the movement is not based off of those people.<br>  <br>  No i dont think our lives would be easier God would just be female. Thats like saying if mars was the blue planet instead of the red planet wouldn't we all get free pizza? It's far from us it doesn't affect us.<br>  <br>  Also it hasn't even been 100 years since women had the right to vote in america, and for a good chunk of that time they were dissuaded from doing so by their families and husbands. So women aren't entirely equal just yet. Women still make on average 70 cents to every dollar a man makes, this is true. I dont hate men i'm just saying everything isn't turning up daises just yet. I mean remember how african americans got the right to vote in 1860 (or around there) and in 1960 they were still rioting for freedom, 100 years isn't even enough. There is still racism today.<br>  <br>  Change doesn't just happen in an instant it takes a long time to do.|`|9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	I'm male, and I do not consider myself a man or a woman.  Why?  Because that very physical part is kept away from the brain.  The mentality is neither male nor female in my opinion.  I, therefore, do not consider myself either in mind but can be swayed just like everyone else (also in my opinion).<br>  <br>  Within the context of "beauty" in this realm of sight, we are ugly creatures in our minds.  We also do not conform to the same size and shape, since our brains don't actually touch blood and muscle.  The context of christians seeing visions of these angels and demons in the shapes of humans is mere dreaming, daydreaming, and having personal nightmares.  These subtle inconsistencies, easily attainable through "learning", get by them, but we shouldn't hold them in disgust for it, especially if they were born into the brainwashing.  Hey aren't the ones holding humanity back; religion is.  This is merely an example of brainwashing in the form of "not knowing".  Nothing new to religion.<br>  <br>  Take, for instance, the Family Guy clip where Peter is running from big dark turban guy (a scene similar to Indiana Jones movie where Jones reaches for his gun and it's not there).  In order to slow his progress, Peter shouts, "Hey look!  There's a woman learning!"  While the show makes no reference to religion, it shows a detailed example of a religion-based culture in the evidences of appearance similar to that of muslim and jew.<br>  <br>  Why does it seem like we are our bodies?  Because our nervous system works so well that it gives us the sense that we are actually performing basic motor skills when we are merely inside our brains sending out signals to the nerves in our bodies.  It happens so fast that we think we are actually moving limbs.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as 100% or 0% in sexuality.  There can't be because that would imply perfection. It is god in his christian bible that says he would rather you be, "..hot or cold than lukewarm, else [he] will spew you out of [his] mouth.."  here, he is demanding perfection.  Also, I don't know about you, but I know how to keep warm.  This business with keeping warm the way Luke Skywalker ("luke" warm) does is beyond me.  They never mention anything about it in the movies..<br>  <br>  The amount of male hormones within would be drastically reduced if a man were to lose that source.  If a woman were to gain the male source, she would need to take medication to increase the amount of testosterone her body makes.  If a man wanted "pritties" he would have to take meds as well; however, should he continue without them, he would be the one who experiences loss while the female remains near the same.  This analysis does not take into reference the anterior pituitary gland and its role in producing hormones.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it is with this level of logic that I conclude that the female is of a higher build, NOT a weaker one!  Ladies, can't we agree that the female does more than the male in the sexual process that produces life?  None of this "we're pregnant" brainwashing.  The man could take off at any moment leaving a woman to fend for herself.<br>  <br>  While there is no higher "power", there is a higher "intellect" that has to be female.  Why?  Because life is "urge through sex", humankind follows this order of urge from birth to death, and the female bears the burden of continuance therein.<br>  <br>  While there are many examples to many different things within nature, one that I consider closest to this is the Preying Mantis.  In order for the male to complete his sexual process, the female must kill him by ripping his head off.  Evolution has dictated that instinct is fully available for the needs of the preying mantis.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	Because She is female.<br>  It's men's freewill that makes it tougher for us|`|rl0Zq1gvaa	I've upset many of my fellow believers for saying this but...<br>  <br>  "Do you really think if you sneaked a peak up God's robe, you're going to find man parts?"<br>  <br>  Women's roles biblicaly and historically have been limited largely due to human and cultural regulations, not  because God said so.

XN0cYCATaa	The curious as well as the critics of Christianity ask this question. If God is all-powerful and all loving, then why does He permit evil and suffering in the world? Various answers have been given but permanently settling the issue is impossible because so many of our answers raise further questions. Nevertheless, our lack of ability to answer the question perfectly does not mean that we cannot offer solutions. Of course, I do not assume to be able to answer these questions definitively, but I can offer some solutions.<br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/questions/suffering.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/questions/suffering....</a>|`|atAZlwGdaa	I believe we will have a day of judgment.

Sin and people, let people suffer.  God does know that some suffering is good because it makes us stronger.  A baby's suffering must be the sins of the ancestors or parents.  A baby does not sin, but the sins of the forefathers can be passed down to the fourth generation and in some cases even further because the curse is never broken.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 26:2 "....a curse without a cause does not come."   The curse causeless does not come.<br>  <br>  Man cannot curse those whom God has blessed.  God can remove His blessing.<br>  <br>  God gave us the Word of God, the Holy Bible, and Leviticus and Deuteronomy are full of God saying "If you will do this then I will put none of these curses or disease or problems upon you."<br>  <br>  Jesus is returning soon and then He will fix every one's problems and wipe out the devil.  Until He returns, read the Word of God, the Holy Bible KJV, and stop the suffering.<br>  <br>  Man does not listen to God.  Therefore, man suffers and his family suffers.

If you were God would you take away all human suffering?  Before you answer too quickly think about what we can gain as humans from suffering and why God would allow it.  How can suffering bring us closer to God?  What can the suffering of Jesus teach us about our own suffering?  I encourage to think about suffering in a different way.|`|7178e20a3678c4210fe9d3bc2e2ab936aa	I'm sorry for some of the previous answers.  If you are truly seeking an answer, then they probably depressed you.  <br>  <br>  First, there is a God.  Just because there are people who don't believe in Him doesn't mean He is not real.  Some things are true whether you believe in them or not.<br>  <br>  Think about this.  What if God stopped all bad things from happening?  How would we learn and grow?  It's important to remember that God does not cause bad things to happen, but he does permit them.  Every person has agency, or the ability to choose right or wrong.  God cannot interfere with our agency.  It is a gift to each of His children.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are evil people out there who will make very wrong choices and sometimes the innocent are the ones who suffer. But Heavenly Father promises us that we will not go through anything that we cannot handle and He will be there to strengthen and support us. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Keep the faith.<br>  <br>  |`|bnpJQGt3aa	God gives people choices. He loved us so much that he let us make our own decisions. Leaders make bad choices every second. People hurt others. This leads to people suffering. This is the reason God promised us heaven. A place where no one will suffer. He hates to see people suffering even more than you do. He gives people the choice to be free of it by letting us go to heaven.|`|ozNFdz6Paa	It all started with Adam and Eve.  When Eve got tempted by Satan, she took a bite of the forbidden fruit on the forbidden tree; then Adam ate the fruit; then the suffering began for ever.  That is called orginal sin.  That is why the babies are baptized a few months after they are born to get rid of Original sin and then it's the parents job to make sure they grow up like Jesus and follow the ten commandments or they run into sin and sufferring again.  It is mostly the Devil's work when there is suffering; but if its a baby at 7 months old, and being beaten, cut, broken, and torn; he is with God already; because he is so young.  If God would just step in and remove it all, it would be breaking the law he made for Adam and Eve after they ate of the fruit.  God will come back and take over again, but it could be soon or it could be a little later in life. |`|aXvh8ke5aa	Then there goes free will if God came and fixed everything.

We humans don't want bad things to happen and we want someone to blame when they do, and the easiest is to blame God. Why?  Because to live the life that God calls us to means sacrifice. It means no longer doing things "my way" but yielding to God to do things "His way". But there are good reasons for suffering, including Christian suffering. It is our response to that suffering that will change our life. Without bad how would we really know just how wonderful good is? What would be your guage?<br>  God is our creator and He does know what we need, better than we do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a site that can answer many questions:<br>  <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/innocent-suffer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotquestions.org/innocent-suf...</a><br>  Question: "Why does God allow the innocent to suffer?"<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>   In answering this question, the first thing to consider is whether such a thing as “the innocent” even exists. According to the Bible, “the heart is wicked and deceitful above all things” (Jeremiah 17:9), and “all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23). Therefore, no one is innocent in the sense of being sinless. Sin entered the world when Adam and Even rebelled against God in the Garden of Eden, and mankind has been in rebellion ever since. Sin’s effects permeate everything, and the suffering we see all around us is a direct result of that sin.<br>  <br>  But God did not leave us here to suffer pointlessly. Our loving and merciful God has a perfect plan to use that suffering to accomplish His threefold purpose. First, He uses pain and suffering to draw us to Himself so that we will cling to Him. Jesus said, “In the world you shall have tribulation” (John 16:33). Trials and distress are not something unusual in life; they are part of what it means to be human in a fallen world. In Christ we have an anchor that holds fast in all the storms of life, but if we never sail into those storms, how would we know that? It is in times of despair and sorrow that we reach out to Him, and, if we are His children, we always find Him there waiting to comfort and uphold us through it all. In this way, He proves His faithfulness to us and ensures that we will stay close to Him. An added benefit is that as we experience God’s comfort through trials, we are then able to comfort others in the same way (2 Corinthians 1:4).<br>  <br>  Second, He proves to us that our faith is real through the suffering and pain that are inevitable in this life. How we respond to suffering is determined by the genuineness of our faith. Those with faith truly from God, “the author and finisher of our faith” (Hebrews 12:2), will not be crushed by suffering, but will come through the trial with their faith intact, having been “proven through fire” so that it “might be found to praise and honor and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 1:7). Those are the ones who do not shake their fists at God or question His goodness, but instead “count it all joy” (James 1:2), knowing that trials prove that they are truly the children of God. “Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because having been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him” (James 1:12).<br>  <br>  Finally, God uses suffering to take our eyes off this world and put them on the next. The Bible continually exhorts us to not get caught up in the things of this world, but to look forward to the world to come. This world and all that is in it will pass away, but the kingdom of God is eternal. Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world” (John 18:36), and those who would follow Him must not see the things of this life, both good and bad, as the end of the story. Even the sufferings we endure and which seem so terrible “are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed in us” (Romans 8:18).<br>  <br>  Could God prevent all suffering? Of course. But He assures us that “all things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose” (Romans 8:28). So even suffering is part of the “all things” that God is using to accomplish His good purposes. His plan is perfect, His character is flawless, and those who trust Him will not be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Recommended Resource: Disappointment with God by Philip Yancey<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|8UtYmKfMaa	The question is rather, why does God not let every one suffer all the time!? The main reason God made people, his number one command, is for them to love him with all their heart. He gave humans everything they have! And this is what God built humans to do - to love him and obey him. <br>  <br>  So if someone is not doing that, why should God give them anything but suffering? Why is he so good to sometimes give them happy times and laughter? <br>  <br>  To me it's like nursing some near-dead stranger back to life and bringing him into your home and giving him food and shelter. And then one day when you come back from work he's stolen your stuff and defecated on your carpet.<br>  <br>  |`|uN6LqACHaa	God doesn't "let" people suffer. There is good and evil in everything, there has to be a balance. It is our choice to be good. People get hurt and have pain and ailments because we are human and have feelings, just like every other warm blooded being. Some things you just have to trust and believe. If more people did that, and respected others and their beliefs, there would be much less suffering in this world and much less killing.|`|63c0a157955b9d4eae3b08eafe1d1e26aa	The Christian Bible does not say that all sufferings are caused by the devil. The Christian Bible says that the Christian God allows people (even His people - Christians) to suffer; because with suffering, people will know what they can achieve. Check this out:<br>  "He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver."<br>  How does one refine gold? By smelting it - putting it on high heat and skimming off the impurities.<br>  <br>  For the benefit of the world, God did not let His only begotten son, Jesus, turn away from suffering even though He did not deserve it; but after the suffering (re: Mel Gibson's Passion) Jesus was exalted to the highest possible position. [<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:8-9;&version=31;]" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  Just like a wise parent would allow a child to experience the consequence of a bad decision, instead of cleaning up the mess immediately; the Christian God (who claims to be the Creator) also allows people to experience the consequences of their own decisions. Unfortunately people (like children) don't accept that they don't always make good decisions.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|64d77l4qaa	Assuming the Christian version of God is true?<br>  <br>  Well... why do people let people suffer?

Infact, we wouldn't be able to do whatever we wanted because some of what we would do would cause suffering to other people.<br>  <br>  So by preventing suffering, we would have to have our free will taken away. The Christian God seems to want humans to have that free will.|`|AA11938016	I dont know why god lets people suffer your right he or she is god and they should have the ability to just have it all stop, and some times I dont understand why he lets good people suffer so much.<br>  In my life I have had a lot of things go on, my son had to have a kidney transplant but threw out his life he had kidney problems and I questioned it too, but when he had his transplant there was a nun at childreens hospital who came to sit with me at that moment I didnt want any one around me, and when I asked her why god was letting this happen, she said to me god didnt do this we all have free will and things happen, but god places people in our lives to help us get threw things and some times things dont always come out the way you want them and it's easy to get mad and blame god, but god is there and helps us get threw it she said she didnt understand the reasons but didnt want to belive that god would hurt people on pourpose that there are so many people that god cant fix every one there are so many people asking for help so that is why he places certain people in our lives to help us threw things and that every thing we go threw is for a reason.<br>  <br>  So I guess you just have to keep beliving and keep the faith, :)|`|slTDYbeaaa	Lots of folks might say that He has a "plan" or something like that, but I choose to not believe in God.

How could it be that God can let people suffer? Sounds like a cruel God. But if we can understand some truths about the position of the souls in this material world, what is their relationship to this world and God then we would have a better understanding. To love God is our ultimate goal in life and is not such a cheap thing that simply by lip service saying "I love God" will this mean that we really do love God. <br>  <br>  First of all, the nature of love is that it must be voluntary, otherwise there is no question of love. Out of God's causeless compassion and mercy He gives us minute independence to choose who we want to serve: God or His illusory energy, which is called maya in Sanskrit. <br>  <br>  The illusion is to think that we are this material body and the purpose is only to serve and enjoy through this body. But the soul is actually our real self and this body is only a temporary vehicle for the soul. Our real purpose is to serve God and give all happiness to Him. Then we will be happy. Just as if you water the roots of a tree then the trunk of the tree, all of the branches, sub-branches, leaves, twigs, flowers etc are all served and all parts are satisfied.<br>  <br>  When we misuse our minute independence than we have to reap the results of our karma (activities). Thus we suffer or enjoy the results of bad or good karma. <br>  <br>  This suffering can be compared to a child, who is determined to touch fire. The parents warn him about the consequences, but the child is determined to touch the fire saying, "Oh I want, I want, I want." So the parent knows that the only way to teach the child is to allow the child to do it and then he will learn from his bitter experience. So when the child touches the fire he then screams "Awwwww!!!!" He never will do that again. Similarly God has laws and He gives instructions throughout the world in different scriptures, which are written according to the level of the students, time, place, circumstances etc, but the essence is the same. <br>  <br>  If we are sincere by trying to understand God and what is our real purpose in life then we will be open to follow the laws of God. As a result, all of our problems will go away. This is a fact. However the problem is that most of us are like the child, who has to learn the hard way by first eating the bitter pill of experiencing suffering, but ultimately we may hopefully come to the correct conclusion of turning to God, by associating with those persons whose only business is to love God.<br>  <br>  Your question show some very good intelligence on your part. Thank you.|`|FRKCrLNSaa	Good question, I'm not sure how to answer it though, I think God can't help everyone at all times, if there really is a God!|`|AA10493307	Suffering has a multitude of causes.  <br>  <br>  Time and chance happens to all (Ecclesiastes 9:11).  <br>  <br>  In regard to Christians, God is the ultimate Father.  He allows his children to start making mistakes, just as an earthly father who sees his son becoming an adult will have to acknowledge his son will have to make his own mistakes and learn through experience and no longer have the protections of childhood.  We have decisions to make.  God is not going to force us to make the right decisions.  And, making wrong decisions will cause us to suffer.  <br>  <br>  Life is a test.  We cycle through the sin-suffer-repent cycle until we develop holy righteous character.  <br>  <br>  Along with our trials and temptations (tests) God will provide a way of escape (1 Corinthians 10:13).

When I hear something stated as truth, I get in touch with how that part of me feels about it and accept or pass on it based on that.  Most of all, I accept and enjoy the fact that my way is just that; my way and I don't require a church, a book or a legion of followers to be happy with it.

This is applicable whether one defines God as Everything Existing or Everything Existing plus Everything Beyond That (lol). That is the (key) difference between Atheists and Theists - the being guided or not.<br>  <br>  I am a Naturalistic Pantheist. If I were to play the concept saying that I believe in God but not follow a Religion, I would mean that Religion takes (is taking) us to our Destiny; toward God is All is God. We are guided by forces of Collective Unconsciousness we are barely aware of, aren't we? Thus, we should not abandon the Spiritual. We are yet so far away (immature) from abandoning Mother Earth anyway.<br>  <br>  Religion is not something you believe in or not, but a path within the realm of Maturity.<br>  <br>  Whatever it is, it is subject to too much rationalization, specially in YA :)<br>  <br>  The key question is if Rationalization, which gave birth to God - Human Form and took us away from the Spiritual toward Science, has given our Civilization a "positive Destiny"(?) Otherwise, we carry the gene of self destruction and the abandoning of YA :(<br>  <br>  I've gone a bit away from your question.

LDL5rlapaa	Even before Jesus died on the cross, God desired obedience over sacrifice, <br>  1 Samuel 15:22, And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.<br>  Once Jesus died for our sins on the cross the need for sacrifices was over, animals are not perfect and that is why God wanted obedience of his Word. Animals could never cleanse our hearts, it took the pure blood of the messiah to do that, today if you are saved the kingdom of God is within you, becoming a born again Christian, accepting Jesus into your heart as Lord and Saviour allows the Holy Spirit to live permanently in your heart, and seals your soul until the day of redemption. A short Sinners Prayer can change your life today, if you are sincere, Just humbly bow your head and ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins and come into your heart and save you,,, Ask Him to make you a child of God...Thats all this is to it, the perfect blood of Jesus that he spilled on the cross will wash away all your sins forever. He was perfect and died once for all mankind. Praise the Lord.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That is forbidden. Jesus nullified the sacrifices<br>  |`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Still?

True believers sacrifice themselves daily.  It is called dieing to sin, or not giving in to ones sinful nature.  Every time a Christian denies his or herself by not doing something which he or she knows is not pleasing to God, he or she is in effect self sacrificing or dieing to sin which is pleasing to God.  Both the Old and New Testament call for this kind of sacrifice.  God Bless You!|`|35f2da7c740a0f3e3966c1c27cb00175aa	I'm an atheist, just so u know.<br>  <br>  though the mainstream Christians shy away from that kind of thing, I am positive there are still some minor cults of Christianity out there that still do that kind of thing. these would be the same ones that also hunt witches and do daily exorcisms. |`|746e4e8740cfe51a1fcd21aa7cde424daa	Christians do not sacrifice animals to God that was done in the Old Testament the new Teatament Christ was the sacrifice. |`|V9HzFHodaa	Those were old testament rituals, mainly before Christ.

XAkzG13gaa	no one knows what you're talking about. |`|Du8h3uKJaa	I encourage everyone (esp. Christians) to watch this movie called “Halloween- Trick or Treat”<br>  <br>  It traces Halloween’s pagan origins and history. The Pagan/Occult calendar of Druids, Witches, Pagans and Satanists marks Halloween as one of their highest “holy days.” The video uncovers the mystic Druidic rites and ceremonies with which “Samhain” (Halloween) was originally observed thousands of years ago. The modern-day occult rituals seen in the film are real and not re-enactments.<br>  <br>  All the seemingly innocent symbolism of Halloween — black cats, snakes, broomsticks, bonfires, “trick or treat,” jack-o-lanterns, apple dunking and Halloween costumes — has its roots in Sorcery, Witchcraft and Satanism. Parents' responsibilities are challenged to decide whether to allow their children to participate in celebrations which glorify Pagan Occultism.<br>  |`|h2GN2A8Iaa	What, you think Christians have not ALREADY done that?

AA10311549	Some Christians are ALREADY doing that because of their irrational beliefs!<br>  <br>  I worked as a nurses's aid in a Pediatric Ward of a hospital and I saw several cases where children died because parents "prayed" for their child's recovery and ignored what God had ALREADY given them to help their child -- good medical practice.<br>  <br>  I admit this is not a common factor but it does happen.  I also saw two cases where Social Services had to intervene and take children away from their parents because their health and even their very lives were endangered because of their parent's irrational "religious " beliefs.<br>  <br>  But dangerous and abusive behaviors toward children due to irrational religious beliefs are more common than you might realise.<br>  <br>  Look how many teens are still being tossed away by their parents and families because they are gay!<br>  <br>  Look at the teen suicide rate because of the intollerance of family and society and alienation gay teens experience.  Gay teens have 4 times the siicide rate than straight teens and the intolerance of religion is one of the main causitive factors.  Too many parents are "loving" their children to death, because their interpretation of love is so faulty and rest on irrational beliefs and unreasonable expectations.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	No, I wouldn't.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  I wonder if the people saying yes think that Andrea Yates should have been found innocent.<br>  <br>  I bet those who say they would also believe that even though Satan is the great deceiver they can with absolute certainty tell that a demand to kill comes from the God who doesn't like killing rather than the deceiver who wants to see people suffer.|`|yuOuoCfDaa	and so what are you sane--- for asking this question|`|wU3mgjAKaa	No, I personally do not believe in God.

God told him to sacrifice his son and he was willing to do it to please the Most High.  It may sound cruel but if you understood his love for his creation, he was testing his faith and that is why Abraham is known as the father of the faithful.  He is also the reason why the Most High made promises and why we are inheritors of his kingdom.  My point is that if the Most High asks something of us, we should do it no matter how cruel it may seem.  Obviously he tests our faith in him and there is an underlying message in what he requested of Abraham.  As for myself, I don't know what I would do since I haven't been put in that position.|`|HBL42Yqoaa	NO. I've thought about this sort of thing for years.

He had just one son who he loved dearly with all his heart. And he was also a man of God. One day God told him he had to make a sacrefice (as God-fearing people often did before Jesus came along) which he assumed would be a goat, but God told him he had to sacrefice his son because this would show his loyalty to God. So Jacob took his son up the hill to the place where they sacreficed Goats. Just as he was about to do it, God stopped him and told him that his intentions were enough and that by following God's instructions he had shown his faith. <br>  <br>  The point I am making really has nothing to do with whether you would kill a child or not. Its more to do with the fact that as a Christian, you not only pray to God, but you can and do hear from him. Its not a voice, but I experience it as a feeling, like something in the back of your mind. Some people call it your inner voice. <br>  <br>  And sometimes what he seems to be saying really doesnt make sense at all, but its what needs to occur because ultimately he has a great plan for everyone, better than we could ever imagine or hope for  :)<br>  <br>  But yes I would agree that it is never right to kill anyone!! If you think God is telling you that then you are really not right. Please notice that God did not allow Jacob to kill his son ;) x|`|NXWoxV2Caa	This question is stupid.

Il processo di Oslo rischia il collasso definitivo.<br>  10 Giugno: muore il Presidente siriano Hafez El Assad. Gli succede suo figlio Bachar.<br>  11 Luglio: si apre a Camp David tra Arafat, Barak e Clinton la conferenza per lo statuto finale di Cisgiordania e Gaza. Il vertice si chiuderà senza nessun accordo e senza dichiarazioni congiunte. <br>  Fonti giornalistiche imputano il fallimento della conferenza alla questione di Gerusalemme e dei luoghi santi, in realtà mediatori palestinesi riferiscono che non c'era accordo quasi su nessun punto in discussione.<br>  28 settembre: in un clima di forte tensione, per le commemorazioni dei massacri di Sabra e Chatila e per l'ennesimo blocco degli accordi di pace, Likud Ariel Sharon (uno dei responsabili del massacro di Sabra e Chatila) si reca in visita, con un folto seguito di poliziotti, alla Spianata delle Moschee. Esplode la seconda Intifada detta “di Al Aqsa”. Ne seguono gravi incidenti, il giorno seguente l'esercito apre il fuoco e uccide 7 palestinesi, nelle settimane successive i morti saranno oltre cento. Gli scontri si estendono anche ai villaggi palestinesi all'interno di Israele e ai confini con il Libano dove gli Hezbollah fanno prigionieri tre soldati e un alto ufficiale israeliani.

Nell'attacco perdono la vita anche due donne palestinesi che si trovavano casualmente nei pressi della zona dell'attacco.<br>  E' il primo attacco diretto ad assassinare i leader della nuova intifada.<br>  Con il fallimento degli accordi di Camp David e la mancata applicazione degli accordi di Sharm el-Sheik l'Autorità palestinese continua a controllare solo il 20% di Cisgiordania (13,1%) e Gaza (70%). I territori occupati nel '67 sono divisi in zone a diverso statuto:<br>  ZONA A - Sotto il controllo dell'Autorità palestinese, ci sono fondamentalmente i grandi centri abitati. (17,2% secondo Sharm el-Sheik)<br>  ZONA B - In queste aree la sicurezza resta nelle mani degli israeliani che vi mantengono quindi esercito e polizia. (23,8% secondo Sharm el-Sheik)<br>  ZONA C - Sotto il totale controllo israeliano. (59% secondo Sharm el-Sheik) I nuovi coloni israeliani insediati nei territori in violazione degli accordi di Oslo ammontano a 78.500 con 11.190 nuovi alloggi e gli insediamenti sono passati dai 122 del '93 ai 141 del 2000. Viceversa i palestinesi senza casa a causa di demolizioni amministrative sono dal '98 ad oggi 13.000.<br>  Sempre con provvedimenti amministrativi sono stati confiscati 35.000 ettari di terra, il più delle volte per la costruzione di strade che collegano gli insediamenti dei coloni e che spezzano ogni continuità territoriale dell'ipotetico stato palestinese.<br>  Infine, da Oslo ad oggi, i palestinesi hanno subito 331 giorni di chiusura delle frontiere anche questo impedisce la mobilità intera dei palestinesi che non possono passare da una zona all'altra proprio a causa di quella divisione in zone dovuta al processo di pace. <br>  Dicembre: Estremo tentativo a Taba (Egitto) di riannodare il negoziato. Il primo ministro Barak si dimette dopo aver tentato di varare un governo di unità nazionale, Israele va verso nuove elezioni.<br>  ?<br>  2001<br>  Gennaio: Tutti i tentativi dell'amministrazione Clinton di varare un nuovo accordo di pace falliscono.

Con una vasta operazione, durata più di cinque ore, distruggono almeno 25 palazzine e baracche. Gli israeliani giustificano la prima azione militare diretta dentro le zone dell'autonomia palestinese con la necessità di difendere l'insediamento di coloni di Gush Katif e in risposta ai colpi di mortaio che da qualche giorno vengono diretti sulle colonie israeliane. <br>  14 Aprile: scontri tra israeliani e guerriglieri Hezbollah nella zona delle "Fattorie Shebaa" tra Libano e alture del Golan, occupata dagli israeliani nel '67 e ancora sotto il loro controllo.

Vengono colpiti posti di polizia palestinese e basi di Forza 17, occupata la zona di Beit Hanoun e il territorio della striscia di Gaza viene diviso in tre settori con barriere dell'esercito israeliano.<br>  L'invasione israeliana provoca la reazione americana, il segretario di Stato Powell giudica l'azione israeliana "eccessiva e sproporzionata". E' il primo intervento diretto della nuova amministrazione Bush.<br>  Durante la sera del 17 l'esercito israeliano si ritira dalle zone occupate. <br>  Le fonti militari dichiarano che tutto si è svolto secondo piani già stabiliti, ma i media israeliani concordano nel ritenere le pressioni americane come la vera causa del rapido ritiro dell'esercito dalle zone occupate. <br>  18 Aprile: Ancora colpi di mortaio su colonie e territorio di Israele e nuova incursione israeliana all'interno della striscia di Gaza, nella zona di Rafah, i militari israeliani distruggono un posto di polizia.<br>  19 Aprile. Arafat da' ordine alla polizia palestinese di impedire tiri di mortaio verso le zone israeliane mentre l'esercito israeliano smantellale barriere che dividevano in tre settori la striscia di Gaza.

Resta alta la tensione con la Siria che torna a minacciare ritorsioni per l'attacco subito il 15 aprile.<br>  In Israele il Parlamento vara una commissione di inchiesta sull'operazione"Giorni roventi" che ha portato l'esercito ad occupare le zone dell'autonomia palestinese e sul precipitoso ritiro che ne è seguito.      1 Giugno: Attentato suicida di Hamas a Tel Aviv in una discoteca, 21 morti e 100 feriti.

Forse perché rappresenta la persona che "dovrebbe" portare la pace universale, la rappresentazione del Cristo vivente e poi la Sua parola arrivare in ogni angolo del mondo.<br>  Hai mai visto fermare una guerra con la sua presenza?<br>  No.<br>  Hai mai visto i popoli della terra cambiare perché Lui si é recato a visitarli oppure perché parla dal balcone di S.Pietro?<br>  No.<br>  Cristo in terra é esistito e ritornerà ma non sarà nessun uomo a rappresentarlo con tanto di mantello e tunica bianca, e scarpette rosse con un baldacchino portante.....il mio Gesù era umile portava una veste sdrucita e sandali ai piedi.<br>  Gesù era il Figlio di Dio, la Sua rappresentazione era questa.<br>  Semplice fra i semplice, umile tra gli umili.<br>  mi sono fatta capire spero Grazie|`|561e6af41bd94581f539e204d8079a05aa	Perchè si portano i paraocchi e il cervello lo si manda in letargo...

Dar peso alle sue parole è come dar peso alle parole di Gesù stesso. è il capo delle Chiesa intera e persino i politici possono trovare dei suggerimenti dalle sue parole, come faceva Giorgio la Pira, un politico santo.<br>  <br>  Al contrario, non dar peso alle sue parole può portare a disastri immensi: si pensi a quando Giovanni Paolo II tante volte si era pronunciato contro un eventuale guerra in Iraq, ma il signir Bush incurante prima diede l'ultimatum e ora sta ancora facendo una guerra irrisolta con numerose vittime anche tra innocenti|`|5f8e55024f3a55f30ce55e2fd371a959aa	Per noi cattolici il papa è il Vicario di Cristo e il capo dalla Chiesa, non riteniamo, come te, che sia stato eletto da cardinali corrotti, ma che l'elezione sia guidata dallo Spirito Santo e non lo baciamo o osanniamo come una reliquia, ma ne seguiamo i dettami perchè lo consideriamo dotato di un'autorità che gli viene da Dio. Dalla tua domanda presumo che tu non sia cattolico, quindi non vedo cosa ti debba interessare di quello che noi facciamo o diciamo e di quello che noi pensiamo della nostra guida o del fatto che lo seguiamo, ogni gruppo ha le sue regole e chi vuole stare nel gruppo le segue, altrimenti, visto che l'associazione è libera, faccia quello che ritiene meglio per lui.|`|94055ed0ecf727e77e84acf7c707dd57aa	Ma perché? Strapparsi i capelli, urlare, piangere x toccare una parte del corpo di un cantante tipo marilin menson ti sembra + giusto?<br>  Io non capisco xkè ce l'avete coi Cristiani e col Papa.<br>  Ditemi la verità. I Cristiani, il Papa, che male fanno al mondo? Chiedono di ammazzarsi di sacrifici? Chiedono di dedicare 20 ore al giorno alla preghiera? A me sembra di no. Cosa dice il Papa? Le stesse cose che diceva Gesù. Amare Dio e amare il prossimo. Queste sono le cose + importanti. A me non sembra sbagliato seguire questi valori. Il Papa influenza la tua vita con quello che dice? Non credo. Ogniuno è libero di fare quello che vuole.<br>  Se io ascolto quello che dice il Pontefice, (perché anche secondo me è giusto) io dico... ma alla gente che glie ne frega? Ma x quale contorta ragione mi devono giudicare? E fate attenzione, la Chiesa non giudica nessuno! La Chiesa ribadisce solamente quelli che sono i dogmi, appunto della Chiesa.<br>  A me sembra che invece che tu hai giudicato. Hai detto che i Cardinali sono corrotti. Ma xkè? Li conosci? Li hai visti forse? Hai un documento segreto che lo dimostra? Allora perché dici che sono corrotti? Lo sai x certo o l'hai sparata lì solo perchè ti stanno antipatici (non so come mai) e speri davvero che siano corrotti così che un giorno potrai dire: "Avevo ragione!!" Fatti una settimana di ritiro in preghiera in Vaticano e poi dimmi se la gente che c'è fa davvero così schifo.<br>  Lo disse già Gesù ai suoi tempi: "Come hanno perseguitato me, così perseguiteranno anche voi" è proprio quello che sta accadendo e che anche tu stai contribuendo a fare.<br>  Ti da noia quando il Papa è acclamato? Gelosia forse. Dimmi, cos'è che tu fai e che invece il Pontefice non fa? Sei così tanto superiore? Preferiresti qualcuno che sia pronto a giudicarti e a menarti di botte dopo ogni tuo errore o preferiresti quacuno che sia sempre disposto a perdonarti e a darti conforto e consiglio?<br>  Rifletti (seriamente) su ogni domanda che ti ho fatto.|`|LkdDxMeaaa	be', siamo nel "paese della chiesa"!<br>  l'italia è stata e sempre sarà succube del papa e della chiesa cattolica... <br>  certo, penso sia meglio di questa che di altre confessioni magari ancora più brutali ed invasive...|`|b2Y4StA2aa	Sinceramente non mi è proprio piaciuti il tono con cui hai rivolto questa domanda! MOLTO probabilmente non sei cattolico.<br>  E' la testimonianza di Cristo in terra, il successore di Pietro:<br>  "Tu sei Pietro, e su questa pietra edificherò la mia Chiesa e a te darò le chiavi del Regno dei Cieli" disse Gesù.<br>  Io non condivido tutte le polemiche del papa di questo periodo, però non lo denigro così! C'è molta gente che crede davvero in lui e lo seguirebbero in capa al mondo!! Hanno una fede molto forte e non devono essere trattati così. Perciò vedi di modificare il tono la domanda.<br>  Ps: i cardinali eleggono il papa grazie all'intercessione dello Spirito Santo.<br>  <br>  Ti rispondo: Dio è Trino e unico. Detta in termini semplici Dio consta di tre persone che sono però la stessa cosa: Padre, Figlio e Spirito Santo.<br>  Lo Spirito Santo indica la potenza divina che riempie gli uomini di ragione e senno con i suoi sette doni (<a href="http://spazioinwind.libero.it/ivipdidio/Preghiere/HTM/sette_doni.htm)." rel="nofollow">http://spazioinwind.libero.it/ivipdidio/...</a><br>  non sono in contatto diretto con Dio, è Lui che li aiuta nelle decisioni e nelle scelte più importanti. Per questo si riuniscono in conclave. <br>  Questo è almeno quello in cui crediamo noi cattolici, perciò non ritengo che il conclave sia composto da un gruppetto di cardinali corrotti.<br>  Ricordo inoltre che queste mie tesi valgono per chi ha fede, è naturale che chi non crede, trova queste cose a rigor di logica assurde.<br>  Inoltre a me papa Ratzinger non piace: è un fascista (ormai lo chiamo Natzinger). Amavo moltissimo Papa Giovanni Paolo II.<br>  <br>  Scusa per il tono mio, ma mi ero un po' alterata.

Bah...troppa libertà di pensiero rende folli...ti fa uscire dalla retta via senza che te ne accorgi. In fondo, se il Papa dice quelle cose non lo fa per puro divertimento. Ha un senso ciò che dice, poi se a te non piace o semplicemente non condividi alcune cose che afferma sono affari tuoi. Lui è il pastore che deve guidare il gregge presso l'ovile.

(le suore che non possono accedere alle gerarchie ecclesiastiche, non possono fare messa, i gay che non meritano rispetto ecc..)<br>  Insomma.. Si prende tutto quello che ha detto e fatto Gesù, si fa il contrario e tutto questo in nome dello stesso Gesù.<br>  La formula funziona!<br>  Non sono appartenente a nessun credo, non sono nemmeno ateo e questo mi permette di guardare le cose con oggettività, cosa che molti cattolici plagiati sembrano non poter fare..|`|eImBfeWIaa	è il vertice di un'istituzione millenaria, volto della fede di milioni di persone sparse per il mondo...

When John the Baptist was asked by soldiers what they should do in response to his preaching on repentance, He had the perfect opportunity to tell them to lay down their weapons BUT he went for their heart and told them not to take more than their wages.

From what I notice they are given wrong information from people and they just go with that.  Instead of doing what is in their heart, not be driven into temptation.  I think the biggest mistakes that people make these days is to impress people, or make someone else happy.  Instead of doing something that will make them happy.  Because how can you make someone else happy if you are unhappy yourself.  The only way you can truly learn something is thru someone else.

You can't make him be a Christian or respect your values, but he will be able to see the impact being s woman of God is on your life, and that alone will be enough to make him change his mind about the Lord (even if he doesn't show it).

Go through the Church to find a marital retreat.|`|SeKR3zncaa	Everyone's different and everyone needs to find their own way to connect with God. While church works for a lot of people, it may not work for your husband and he may need to find another way to feel spiritually connected. Before you and your husband go soul searching to try and reaffirm his faith, you definitely need to sit him down for a talk because the way he mocks your efforts to practice God's teachings is a mark of disrespect.

This means study and worship with a church that preaches the gospel according to the revelation of the Mystery of God, that the risen Lord Jesus Christ gave to the Apostle Paul.<br>  If you will learn about God correctly, then you have a firm foundation to build on, since you will not be wasting time studying a mixed doctrine.

You are sincere about your faith, but it's hard to be faithful when you're put on the defensive.  Especially when it's someone so close that is doing it.<br>  <br>  First, it would be healthy spiritually to forgive your husband for being this way.  It frees you from the pain of the hurt done.<br>  <br>  Seek God with all your heart by reading the Bible and praying all the time.  It will take time, and you will eventually see some changes coming about in you.  You need to make up your mind that you will hold yourself responsible to God despite your husbands provocations.  You can seek to please God and aim high in your efforts to grow and mature spiritually.  <br>  <br>  A note:  Be sure to study the Bible to make sure that what ANYONE is preaching is scriptural. (Acts 17:11) Many are mistaken and some seek to deceive.  Too many people have been blindly misled by people who do not teach the Bible, but rather teach their own opinions.|`|YPAD85FUaa	sounds like your husband is only going to church to humor you and that he doesn't really believe.  also, it sounds like he is trying to manipulate you with your beliefs.  try talking to him and if he won't give you a straight answer then tell him you need marriage counseling.<br>  you could just tell him that he doesn't have to come to church with you if he doesn't believe in it, but i don't know how you'd feel about that.  it seems like the best course of action to me.|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	Wow, that's a tough situation where I could see how you could be torn. Instead of acting out in anger towards your husband explain to him how you are taking this seriously and if he's not then ask him to stop mocking your efforts and start respecting your decision whether he complies or not. In the end, you can't uplift or help someone else if you don't feel strengthened yourself. So continue with your efforts to do what you feel is right and it will be rewarding. He has to account for himself. It can be hard to do it alone, but as you exercise your faith, you will be rewarded. This is just another hurdle to get over. Keep forgiving your husband. |`|DeZfdcNhaa	Talk to your church about small groups. They are for a group of people around the same age range or a group of people at the same stage of life. It may help your husband to see others around him feeling and doing the same thing. It also will allow you to talk to him on a more one-one basis about God and have others directly talking to him, not just a paster talking to hundreds.

You can't make anyone believe -- there's an expression that goes something like this:<br>  <br>  For those who believe, no explanation is necessary<br>  For those who don't believe, no explanation is possible<br>  <br>  It sounds to me as though your husband doesn't yet believe.  We all find our faith in different ways and at different times.  I really do think that the best way you'll influence him is just by living your faith and letting him see what a positive effect it has in your life.<br>  <br>  Does your church offer any ministries that the two of you could join?  Bible discussions, etc that would get him to focus on his commitment outside of services?  What you're asking is that he become more than a Sunday Morning Christian.  He may not be ready for it but joining a ministry will be an excellent way for you to continue growing in your faith.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think he's baiting you, which is very disrespectful.  You're right that he's mocking you and he needs to understand how hurtful it is.  If he doesn't want to participate, fine, but his shoddy treatment of your beliefs could drive a wedge between you.  <br>  <br>  God has touched you and gotten your attention.  Don't turn away, just make yourself open to the lessons He is sending (even when you don't realize it).<br>  <br>  Blessings!<br>  <br>  |`|GlCZL753aa	Personally, my wife and I really get a lot out associating with other couples who are spiritually strong.  We get to see how they have cultivated the fruitage of God's spirit in their lives and how they work together.  Sometimes seeing how they interact makes us a little bit jealous, and we want to be a little more like them.  Marriage is a three fold cord according to the Bible.  A husband, a wife, and God.  And when all three strands are strong, what a marriage you will have.|`|OAjN34M4aa	Don't forget about God, because he is your husband's hope as well as your own. You can't make your husband love God the way you do or respect your beliefs. But you can pray for him and ask God to do a work in his heart to reveal Himself. The Bible actually states that a believing spouse can sanctify a nonbelieving one in the eyes of the Lord.<br>  If your husband doesn't want to go to church, don't try to make him. It will be hard to be unable to share something with him that is this important to you. But just keep praying for him. I have prayed for people for years and thought I would never see any result, only to be surprised when God moves in them at last.<br>  Remember: nothing should ever come between you and God. He is more important than any spouse or family member. But when you place God first, He will bless all the rest.<br>  <br>  edit: One more thing. Are there any men in your church that your husband can get acquainted with or do things socially with? Men he likes and respects? Another man who is a Godly influence may work wonders.|`|OkFNZuBhaa	If you can, have him read Revelation, that is one of the best chapters in the Bible, it talks about all the signs that shows that the end of the world is near and the rapture. It talks about a man that will come that will be a muslim, he will be in his mid-late 40s and will not believe in God, he will rise to power and everyone will like him except for Christians. Does this sound familiar to you?? That is in Revelation, I don't know the exact verses but it is there if you read it. It tells you everything that will happen before the rapture, and it is all currently coming true right before our eyes, that alone is proof enough that God is real.|`|b6078ba6f0b709ecba50385ae93287b2aa	Some Christian men like to abuse certain parts of Christian Scripture in order to get their way in the home. The problem with this is that marriage is a two-way street, and this is outlined in various passages in the Bible. If Christian men make demands and dominate their wives, they are doing exactly the opposite of what they have been commanded to do (ex: ''Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself up for Her'' Ephesians 5:25 (NIV) ). If your husband is to live out his role in accordance with Scripture, he'll have to stop thinking in terms of ''what's in it for me,'' and start thinking ''what can I do for her?'' You may want to have a discussion with him and bring this up in a calm, patient, and dispassionate way. I'll include a link to an article on the topic that could be helpful for you. Although I've since chosen a different branch of Christianity and now have many disagreements with this site (I wouldn't give you a link to this particular article if I disagreed with what it teaches... in your case, you could probably skip down to the third paragraph), the articles published there helped me out quite a bit, as far as understanding basic Christian morality is concerned, when I became a Christian. As far as helping your husband to believe in God more strongly is concerned, I would suggest that you try to make an agreement with him on some kind of ''prayer schedule,'' a small portion of everyday set aside specifically for prayer (remember to bring this up calmly and dispassionately, rather than going with the ''do this or else'' approach). If you'd like suggestions on what to pray, feel free to email me through my profile, and I'll describe to you my daily routine. <br>  <br>  Peace,<br>  Drew|`|bqIrBR6kaa	Communicate. It is always better to just tell your husband what you are saying now. then tell him that you are trying to develop you spirituality, that it is not instantaneous, that you need his cooperation. Even saints make mistakes. If you do, apologize. Knowing others is wisdom. Knowing yourself is enlightenment. Examine why you react that way to your husbands actuations. Then let it go. Ask him to help you with moral support and not play devil by preying on your guilt.|`|rl0Zq1gvaa	I can't say this from personal experience, as my wife and I are both pretty much on the same page with our spiritual lives and our commitment to our faith, but I would suggest one possible way would be to make a conversation about it.  Perhaps after church, ask him questions about the sermon.  "What did you think about point x?"  or "I'm not sure I agree with when the preacher said (fill in the blank)" and actually talk to him about it.<br>  <br>  If he again starts "throwing the elbow" and saying, "Well, I think YOU should be paying attention to (fill in another blank)," don't be afraid to turn it back and say, "But what about YOU?  Do you feel like you are exactly where you need to be spiritually?"  This has to be done with a lot of sincerity and sensitivity.  It can't be done in such a way where he feels like you're trying to corner him, but we as fellow believer need to be able to "Speak the truth in love" (Eph. 4:15) to one another to help each other grow.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Ephesians  5:25  " Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"<br>  Colossians  3:19 " Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them." Stay in the Word together , pray together, ask him at times ( when he is being a jerk ) Are you forgetting God now ?  Or when he asks you are you paying attention , ask him " are you ?"  |`|flrOp5YLaa	I would pray for God to help you find the words to talk to your husband about what is bothering you.  It is hard to have a personal relationship with God when your hubby is constantly judging you (which, according to the Bible he is not supposed to do).<br>  <br>  Just keep praying!  God will guide you.

Questo perchè la chiesa cattolica classifica troppo spesso gli agnostici come degli inetti.<br>  Il vero problema è che molti non arrivano nemmeno alla lettura del Vangelo, io che non sono credente ho letto Vangelo e parti della Bibbia (che tra le altre cose sono letture belle da leggere) e conosco decine di "credenti" che non hanno mai preso in mano ne vangelo ne bibbia, e si accontentano delle parti selezionate che vengono lette in chiesa.|`|4BbkGVXYaa	La sofferenza, non guarda alle religioni, ma unisce tutti gli uomini.

Almeno ho letto con attenzione la Bibbia e il Corano, ho guardato e guardo cio' che tali religioni fanno nella storia. Questo tuttavia non mi permette di avere che una vaga idee di tali religioni e mi chiedo come e' possibile che a me per capire che non fanno per me ci sia voluto piu' tempo e sforzo  di quanta ne serva a loro per crederci.

Il mondo però è questo ed è composto da credenti, assolutamente stupidi e maleducati e di scarso profilo intellettivo così come ci sono non credenti pieni di talento e altrettanti degni di tornare all'epoca delle caverne. <br>  Che ci vogliamo fare? Generalizzare, come spesso succede, è sintomo di superficialità per la quale, ahinoi, non c'è cura perchè per curarsi bisognerebbe essere, almeno, mediamente  intelligenti.|`|823f4785f6def1289429b70a6bb4c539aa	Io sono buddista. Ciò in cui credo non trascende l'uomo, ma è dentro di lui. Chi pratica il buddismo non vuole dimostrare nè negare l'esistenza di Dio, ma cerca dentro di sè la risposte che cerca, affidandosi alla pratica quotidiana (che per un cattolico praticante è come andare in chiesa la domenica). Se dovessi spiegare la pratica buddista e i presupposti filosofici e storici su cui si basa, avrei bisogno di un blog.|`|866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Se Dio è in tutti sta anche nei pedofili quando abusano nei bambini, preti compresi.|`|9c8824a8ab1a5e5e18bab88daccecb8caa	Io sn atea e sn pienamente daccordo cn te...io fino all'anno scorso credevo, certo nn ero informatissima sulla mia religione e alcune cs nn le accettavo, infatti poi pensandoci e risolvendo a fondo il problema ho capito di essere atea.<br>  Ora io cerco di informarmi ancora + d prima sulla religione cattolica, x sapere cm ttt i miei compagni di scuola alle medie credono e si sento bn nel vedere un dio k, a mia opinione nn fa nulla o (+ probabilmente) nn esiste.<br>  Il risultato è k nn se lo kiedono, anzi fnn d peggio, loro nn credono, sn cattolici sl xk in italia è normale esserlo ma nn hnn mai ascoltato 1 messa o 1 lezione d religione, bestemmiano e sn totalmente incivili e irrispettosi del prossimo...io nn credo k oramai qst persone saranno mai veri credenti.<br>  Io per lo meno lo ammetto di nn credere e anzi penso d interessarmi + io d scoprire se dio c'è e cosa fa piuttosto k  loro...<br>  TUTTO QUESTO E' GIUSTO??|`|e855599e3cb6ff96d617e5c785648ac2aa	Nessuno è escluso dalle sofferenza che sia credente o no.<br>  <br>  Devo soffermarmi a lungo sulla  mia sofferenza e sui pericoli della vita?<br>  No, perché insisto sui mezzi della sicurezza: La potenza di Cristo come Salvatore, la fedeltà dello Spirito che dimora in me, la certezza delle promesse divine e l'immancabile efficacia della preghiera. Il Nuovo Testamento insegna una vera "sicurezza eterna" assicurandoci che, nonostante la debolezza, le imperfezioni, gli impedimenti e le sofferenze esteriori, il cristiano può essere sicuro e vittorioso in Cristo, e posso esclamare come l'apostolo Paolo: "Chi ci separerà dall'amore di Cristo? Sarà forse la tribolazione o la distretta, o la persecuzione, o la fame, o la nudità, o il pericolo, o la spada?...Anzi, in tutte queste cose, noi siamo più che vincitori, in virtù di colui che ci ha amati. Poiché io sono persuaso che né morte, né vita, né angeli, né principati, né cose presenti, né cose future, né potestà, né altezza, né profondità, né alcuna altra creatura potranno separarci dall'amore di Dio, che è in Cristo Gesù, nostro Signore."<br>  <br>  Cordialmente, ti saluto.<br>  <br>  PS. Essere Cristiano credente non significa per forza essere cattolico.
6nC1rGgeaa	Most people use this thinking that they can prove taht Africans didn't have it harder than anybody else. Since "everyone else had slaves, the enslavement of Africans isn't more important."<br>  <br>  Most of them don't understand the distinction between slavery in the East and West.<br>  <br>  Also, most people have been conditioned to be against convicts, period. So most of them could probably care less if prisoners were enslaved or not.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|DgqHqNeGaa	some of the points you make are valid, however, the fact still remains that yes, africans were involved in the slave trade of their own peoples before and during the official slave trade with the usa and britain.|`|f6Qad0usaa	Are you serious?<br>  <br>  Ok for starters here you go:  <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20061101faessay85609/ethan-b-kapstein/the-new-global-slave-trade.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20061101fa...</a><br>  <br>  Do you know the difference between "truth" and facts?|`|tEDuNc71aa	Africans did participate. In fact, they often were the ones that caught the slaves and brought them back to the ships for money. Didn't you ever watch Roots?|`|vcPyxYJSaa	why cant african accept at least part of the blame and acknowledge history and stop blaming poor old whiteman for everything|`|M70m0tfiaa	Internal slaving in Africa existed long before the atlantic trade, but additionally, in order for the Triangular slave trade to work there had to be depots of slaves at the ports. <br>  <br>  These slaves arrived there through being 'sold down the river' (which is where this expression comes from) by either the more powerful local tribes or by their own tribes and villagers if, for example they were criminals or trouble-makers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrikan_involvement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.africawithin.com/kwaku/afrika...</a><br>  |`|ridu0Rtwaa	No matter how long you rant about it trying to deny african slavery is a waste of time!!<br>  <br>  It is well documented and the vast majority of those capturing slaves in Africa to sell to the white countries were Africans!!<br>  <br>  This preoccupation with such old events holds everyone back and promotes the victim mentality which holds people back!!<br>  <br>  Surely it is time to move on and start living as an individual,  Especially when so many black and coloured people are now so big in government, industry and commerce and we even have a black president elect!!|`|TasLY97jaa	Because they did.<br>  <br>  I will not elaborate, cause we all know it doesn't matter.  I've researched the matter to death, and am open to any sources and/or research you have that suggests thousands of historians are lying.  The only people that suggest otherwise are those with a 200% obvious agenda to spread victim mentality propaganda.  Whatever makes you feel better.<br>  <br>  The sources backing me up are everywhere.  That's like asking "Where is your source that the pyramids are in Egypt?"  But I'll humor you a bit and let you in on those I've found the most interesting and colorful.  Peruse some historical newspapers/letters/documents from the early 1800's, after England and the U.S. ended the importation of slaves - yes I know your question was not about the Atlantic Slave Trade, but the documents I'm referring to go into much detail regarding your subject matter.  Historians and propaganda artists reflecting on the events of yesteryear do not even come close to painting the same picture.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	If you're going to ask questions with such authoritative sureness of your view, at least do a little research.<br>  For example:<br>  Google "African Slavery" - there are in excess of 21 MILLION references.<br>  The internal and external slave trade of Africa goes back to ancient times, and is still being practised.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	That's a very good question. It's easy for the media and politicians to throw around all sorts of accusations relating to slaves in Africa and what not but usually they do not give out the facts and fabricate stories just for the sake of it. |`|DSp8azw7aa	Of course it has and it still goes on in Africa, the only country I can think of outside of the white slave trade or the sex trade.<br>    Which has gotten even worse now, because of child porn or kiddie porn. |`|xf1I0vbZaa	First of all, slavery has existed everywhere in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas. It was a common practice.<br>  <br>  People don't understand the slavery that was practiced here in the States was unique, because it was based on skin color. A brutal system that was only practiced here in the States. Prior to this, anybody could be slave. Even white people used to be slaves around the world.  <br>  <br>  White people were used as slaves in the U.S. Yes, white people were working next to Africans. What happened was the church in England and white slave traders did not like the fact that white and black slaves were bonding together. They were getting married and having mixed children (polluting white blood) and fighting together to end slavery.<br>  <br>  The church and white slave traders put an end to this by letting the white slaves go free and made them feel good about being white although they were just as poor as slaves. This attitude persisted even until today. It is better to be poor and white than black and poor. <br>  <br>  You can't ignore history. Black people and people of color have never had chance to succeed in this country until very recently when you consider how long this country has been around.<br>  <br>  P.S. Practically every country on earth practiced slavery and modern slavery still exists today. Even in the U.S.<br>  What matters is that we face the legacy of slavery here in the U.S, because for the first time in history (that we know of) slavery was based on skin color. As you can see, we still discriminate each other based on race. Although race is only a social concept. Race is NOT real.<br>  <br>  More info about the social concept of race:<br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_...</a>

Q0aF0Fdmaa	Un villageois marche dans la pénombre au milieu d’une forêt. Devant lui une forme noire sinueuse. Il pense aussit?t : ? un serpent, (sarpa), vite, il faut partir ?. Le voici rentré au village où il explique son aventure ? n’allez pas sur ce chemin, il y a un énorme serpent ?. La rumeur se répand bien vite : là bas un serpent ! La rumeur amplifie aussi. Avec le temps, cela donne  : ? il y a là bas un monstre de douze mètres de long qui a tué des dizaines de personnes ? ! ! !<br>  <br>  Voici pourtant qu’un étranger se rend un jour sur le chemin. Il n’a pas été conditionné par les on-dit de l’opinion. Il se penche à l’endroit en question et trouve... une corde qui a été abandonnée là ! L’étranger revient au village et dit : ? voilà ce que vous avez pris pour un serpent. Le serpent, il n’existe que dans votre esprit ?. <br>  <br>  Que s’est-il passé ? L’illusion s’est produite au sein de la perception. L'illusion individuelle se produit quand le sujet de la veille surimpose à l'objet une forme contenue dans son propre esprit : la corde (=perception), le serpent (=image). Il a vu le serpent là où il n’y avait que la corde. En réalité, il a cru voir mais c’est cette croyance qui a donné lieu à l’expérience. Une fois la peur engendrée, c'est une vraie peur, elle est à même de se répliquer indéfiniment, surtout si la terreur s’empare de la pensée commune. Ce sont cent villageois qui verront le monstre ! <br>  <br>  La racine de l'illusion est dans une projection du couple désir/aversion à l’intérieur des représentations de l’esprit.

Q0aF0Fdmaa	Les "ruminations" font actuellement l’objet de nombreuses recherches scientifiques, elles font partie du style psychologique des personnes anxieuses ou dépressives. <br>  <br>  Elles sont définies comme des pensées déclenchées par les événements de vie, anticipations ou ressassements, qui tournent en boucle sans jamais offrir de solution (à la différence des réflexions volontaires de la résolution de problèmes) ni avoir de fin claire. Toujours présentes, au moins en arrière-fond de nos pensées conscientes et délibérées, elles prennent de la place et consomment de l’énergie mentale inutilement.<br>  <br>  Parfois, elles masquent des inquiétudes plus profondes (de la maladie, de l’abandon, de sa propre mort ou de celle d'un enfant ou d'un proche) qu’il faut aborder en psychothérapie.<br>  <br>  Ta maman a traversé une lourde épreuve, sans peut-être se rendre compte que ses autres enfants pouvaient en souffrir.<br>  <br>  C'est à ce titre -et je pense que tu l'as bien "intégré"- que tu dois lui offrir ton pardon, car quoi qu'elle ait pu dire ou faire, elle n'a pas agi avec l'intention de vous nuire, tant son chagrin devait être important.<br>  <br>  Prendre conscience de ses souffrances est une bonne indication  pour une pratique méditative, où l’on apprendra, comme une hygiène quotidienne, des exercices dans lesquels on s’efforcera de garder son esprit dans le moment présent (en se centrant sur sa respiration, ses sensations corporelles, les bruits environnants) pour peu à peu arriver à prendre du recul envers ce murmure confus de notre ame que représentent les affects liés à celles-ci.<br>  <br>  Dans l'unité.|`|5311bdec444be8fef842e9361cd25b8daa	C'est très délicat comme question et cela n'est qu'une simple hypothèse mais une possibilité est qu'elle le disait pour se déculpabiliser de son désir de ne plus avoir de filles mais d'avoir des garcons ?|`|db7d324289b504f86560139b93d14bdcaa	Juste qu'elle était malheureuse d'avoir perdu sa fille, et qu'elle n'a pas su surmonter son chagrin, même par amour pour ses fils.... Même les parents sont faillibles, ?a ne vient pas de sortir, même si je comprends que ?a ait du te faire souffrir.

Ce sont plut?t des indices qui parsèment son enfance et son adolescence : des attirances pour tel professeur ou tel ami de la famille du même sexe ; une fascination pour tel personnage public homosexuel… Des émois qu’il ne s’explique pas tout à fait, parce qu’à son age, la sexualité et, plus encore, l’homosexualité, ne signifient pas grand-chose pour lui. Ou parce que dans son environnement familial et social, ? on ne parle pas ? de ces attirances-là…<br>  <br>  Pour autant, la plupart des homosexuels s’en doutent depuis l’enfance. Souvent dès l’age de 5 ou 6 ans, c’est-à-dire dans la période de l’?dipe, où se fait le choix de l’objet sexuel. Trois cas de figures sont alors possibles : l’?dipe ? classique ?, qui se porte sur le père dans le cas d’une fille, sur la mère dans le cas d’un gar?on ; l’?dipe inversé, donc homosexuel ; et ceux qui ? balancent ? et qui, bien souvent, deviendront bisexuels.<br>  <br>  Comment expliquer, dès lors, que certains la vivent sur le tard, après des années de vie hétérosexuelle ? <br>  D’après la psychanalyste, ceux-là ont, en réalité, toujours ? su ?, mais ils ont refoulé leur homosexualité pour répondre à la norme sociale.<br>  <br>  ? Elles ont rencontré un homme ou une femme “bien”, elles ont fait des enfants et ont adoré leur maternité ou leur paternité… <br>  Les femmes ont davantage de “facilité” que les hommes à refouler leur homosexualité ou leur bisexualité. ? Jusqu’au coup de foudre : la rencontre avec une personne du même sexe a alors servi de ? déclencheur ?. <br>  <br>  C’est ? ce jour où ils ont su ?. Une étape périlleuse, au vu du grand nombre de désistements familiaux  et publics. <br>  Preuve qu’aujourd’hui encore, il ne suffit pas de ? savoir ?, ni même de ? faire savoir ? pour assumer définitivement. Et sereinement....<br>  <br>  La plus grande preuve que l'on aime un proche, est de le voir heureux et certainement pas en ayant en exprimant tout jugement que l'on pourrait avoir sur sa vie, de surcro?t privée...<br>  <br>  Excellent W.E à tous !!!
Q0aF0Fdmaa	Nous avons tous subi ce qui nous semble être des injustices de la part de nos parents, frères et s?urs, amis, professeurs et plus tard d’un patron, collègues et même de voisins. <br>  <br>  C’est plus ou moins grave dans certains cas, mais dans d’autres nous avons la mémoire longue.<br>  <br>  Puis, avec le temps on en vient à oublier quasiment la cause du désaccord, du ressentiment, pourtant la rancune reste, elle est tenace. Le phénomène est inévitable puisqu’au point de départ, l’être humain est binaire. Il se définit par le moi et le non-moi.<br>   <br>  Pour vivre en harmonie il lui faut faire un effort,cela n’est pas un exercice naturel. Il doit se travailler car l’acceptation de la différence n’est pas nécessairement innée en lui. L’ouverture à la diversité est pourtant essentielle sinon elle cèdera la place aux jugements intempestifs, à la négation face à tout ce qui n’est pas pareil et la conséquence sera inévitablement le rejet et/ou le conflit. <br>  <br>  Bref, s'il n'est pas de tolérance facile, c'est en somme parce qu'il n'y a pas lieu de parler de tolérance là où il n'y a nulle différence, nul risque d'interaction, nulle menace donc de changement. La tolérance est une notion qui définit le degré d’acceptation face à un élément contraire à une règle morale, civile ou physique particulière. Plus généralement, elle définit la capacité d’un individu à accepter une chose avec laquelle il n’est pas d’accord ou qui diffère de ses valeurs. <br>  <br>  Elle est associée à la notion absolue du bien et du mal (dualité). Elle s’exerce lorsqu’on reconna?t qu’une chose est mal, mais que combattre ce mal engendrerait un mal encore plus grand. <br>  Etre vraiment tolérant, c'est d'abord admettre que chacun puisse exprimer sa pensée et agir selon ses convictions, pour autant que cela ne porte pas atteinte à la liberté et aux droits d'autrui. Mais être tolérant, c'est aussi reconna?tre à chacun la liberté et le droit de dire pourquoi il n'est pas d'accord avec telle orientation, tel enseignement ou telle pratique, et de prendre les décisions que lui dicte sa conscience.<br>  <br>  Je viens de décrire notre ?tous les jours?, celui de personnes issues d’une même famille, d’un même groupe social, d’une même cellule professionnelle, etc. <br>  <br>  En définitive, qu’on le veuille ou non, nous sommes tous confrontés à l’intolérance, d’où que l’on vienne, mais à quel degré ?<br>  <br>  C’est le fanatisme qui est le contraire de la tolérance. Qu’en acceptant difficilement la différence chez les autres, on risque d’être discriminatoire et méprisant.<br>  <br>  Et si : <br>  - chaque fois qu’on s’apprête à médire, à juger sévèrement, à blesser ou à rejeter, on se rappelait une expérience similaire vécue ! <br>  <br>  - on se mettait à la place de celui qui va subir nos foudres, serions-nous aussi virulent ? Comment réagirions-nous ?<br>  <br>  Bonne journée à tous !!!|`|lYBZLQ7Caa	oui j'y crois !<br>  l'intolérance amène la tolérance parce que l'on ne fait pas aux autres ce que...<br>  mais on peut être tout aussi tolérant là où on n'a jamais souffert, c'est comme être humain dans son comportement, ?a s'apprend, par l'amour de ses parents, par la connaissance...|`|6l5r778Laa	Même pas , voir au contraire il se venge sur les autres.<br>  Je connais des personnes qui ont subi des remarques blessantes sur leur physique (et qui les ont donc blessées) et bien ?a les empêche pas de faire la même chose, au contraire ils se défoulent!!!!|`|6uWyVRUaaa	pour une intolérance donnée:<br>  tout dépend du "stimuli" qui à provoquer cette intolérance et de comment cette intolérance à forgé l'esprit petit à petit.<br>  <br>  il faut avoir compris ce qui a provoqué l'intolérance pour espérer l'adapter sur d'autres schémas "stimuli / intolérance".<br>  <br>  donc, c'est possible mais pas évident du tout, en gros :)|`|T85gY2ilaa	Malheureusement, non.<br>  <br>  Souvent, c'est même l'inverse. C'est un peu comme une vengance... On a souffert, donc on doit faire souffrir.<br>  <br>  (Ca me fait penser à un interview d'un electeur Arabe de Dieudonné que j'ai vu et qui m'a choqué:<br>  -Pourquoi votez vous Dieudonné?<br>  -Pour ce qu'il dit sur les Juifs<br>  - Mais ca n'a rien d'un programme présidentiel<br>  - Oui, mais comme on insulte les Arabes à longueur de temps, je voie pas pouquoi on pourrait pas faire la même chose avec les Juifs)<br>  <br>  Désolée pour cette histoire vraie et triste, mais je trouve que ca illustre ta question.|`|n5fHOSM2aa	L’intolérance : ce n’est pas de réfuter l’idée de l’autre ; ce n’est pas de refuser d’adhérer aux conceptions de l’autre; ce n’est pas de combattre et résister à l'opinion de l’autre : c’est de ne pas accepter qu’un autre puisse avoir une idée différente de la sienne. C’est exiger que l’autre ait de gré ou de force les même idées que soi-même.<br>  <br>  La pensée est la seule chose au monde qu’aucune dictature <br>  religieuse ou politique ne pourra emprisonner, la notre est tout ce qui fait un chevalier au noble c?ur, et nous désirons transmettre à tous, un message de liberté, d’amour et de paix.

wJznp3xlaa	Comparable je pense.<br>  <br>  Les homos n'ont pas attendus des lois pour avoir des enfants, ce phénomène concernent des millions d'enfants de part le monde (je pèse mes mots). Des études ont été faite sur le sujet depuis 30 ans et démontrent que les enfants élevés par des homos ne se portent pas plus mal que les autres.<br>  <br>  Je ne dirais pas POINT FINAL, car il reste bien des questions à se poser, mais je pense que c'est bien de commencer à signaler cela.|`|5C2wRCZraa	Bonjour<br>  Sourires amusés...<br>  Les homos sont des hommes et des femmes comme les autres, à part cette orientation sexuelle.

Un enfant n’a pas à faire plaisir à ses parents il a à vivre et lorsqu’il fait ce qu’il faut pour s’adapter c’est dans le but d’apprendre à vivre sa vie pas pour compléter la vie de ses parents. Et ?a ,qu’on soit homo ou hétéro c’est une réalité à assumer ,parfois,pris dans ses rêves d’enfant idéal on ne le voit pas venir . <br>  <br>  Dans un coin de nos rêves on a un enfant idéal, de nombreux humains l’ont .Alors on veut un enfant pour prolonger ce rêve parfois l’enfant qui na?t ou qui vient est très différent de cela et il faut s’adapter .Certains n’y réussissent pas non pas parce qu'ils sont homos ou hétéros mais parce qu'ils ont rêvé un enfant mais que la réalité ne correspond pas à leur fantasme . .Et derrière les mots de trasmission,de social etc dont tu parles moi je vois ce rêve,peut-être mal exprimé mais toujours ressenti,ce rêve d'enfant c'est beaucoup plus onirique que social le plus souvent ,et parfois mal préparé  .<br>  Pour ma part je crois que c'est cela le point principal à travailler dans le désir d'enfant.|`|R1y7DCi9aa	Oui je pense que c'est comparable bien que certains hommes hétéros le font par "obligation" de devoir le faire, sans y reflechir avant.<br>  <br>  En tant qu'homo je pense qu'on a la possibilité d'y reflechir car pour nous avoir des enfants n'est pas quelque chose de "tracé" et cela permet de plus reflechir et de plus s'investir aussi.<br>  <br>  C'est toujours un désir de pouvoir transmettre ses genes, sa culture, de donner un petit(e) fils(le) a ses parents, d'avoir un heritier, seulement je pense qu'un homo y portera plus d'attention (en général) et ne fera pas ca parce qu"il faut le faire".<br>  <br>  @ Julien: Si tu ne veux pas enfreindre les lois de la nature alors vis en foret a poil et sans rien d'autre (Si c'est pour toi "naturel").<br>  <br>  TOUT est naturel chez l'homme ou RIEN n'est naturel chez l'homme.|`|Mv1ubx8vaa	Je pense que le seul " hic" dans cette éducation est le regard des autres, des moqueries de l'enfant une fois qu'il sera à l'école, ...<br>  <br>  Les homos ne sont pas different des hétéro, l'éducation de l'enfant est la même, et je pense que l'enfant aura une plus grande ouverture d'esprit et sera beaucoup plus intelligent que certains!<br>  <br>  Un désir reste un désir, qu'il soit chez l'homme ou la femme ...|`|S0t9gYrnaa	Tout ceux qui pense que s'est maaal de jouer avec la nature, ou qui sorte des connerie sur l'évolution de l'enfant ou PIRE: sur la Mode homo,<br>  2 chose a dire: <br>  1: informez vous<br>  2: si vous pensez toujours la même chose après un minimum, mais alors la un tout petit minimum d'information sérieuse, aller vous pendre, le monde s'en portera mieux, et le QI general va sérieusement monter...<br>  <br>  une derniere chose : etienneitoto tu est un idiot sans education qui crois en avoir une.

Mi risulta che la nostra Costituzione parli d "famiglia fondata sul matrimonio", intendendo quello disciplinato dal Codice Civile.  Ed era cosi' in tutta Europa nonche' negli USA. L'accettazione verso le unioni gay e' un fenomeno molto recente e non fa parte della tradizione culturale europea (attenzione: non sto esprimendo un giudizio, sto solo facendo una constatazione di carattere storico). e poi anche la terminologia ha la sua importanza. Per "matrimonio" si e' da sempre inteso quello tra un uomo e una donna. Pensa che perfino in Inghilterra, dove esiste la "civil partnership" per i gay che e' in tutto e per tutto uguale al matrimonio, compreso il diritto di adottare, non se la sono sentita di chiamarla "matrimonio", perche' questo termine indica tradizionalmente l'unione etero!

Si tratta di una spiegazione umanissima che riguarda l'incapacità di molti credenti di affrontare un discorso logico e razionale iin merito al loro credo. Succede anche per molti cristiani che vivono una fede semplice, con un fondamento di tipo emozionale, sentimentale. Se li porti a discutere di qualcosa di più approfondito li spaventi, ma non devi far loro una colpa. Hanno soltanto quei talenti e quelli usano. <br>  D'altronde è abbastanza usuale trovare tra i testimoni di Geova persone di cultura media, se non bassa quindi non potrai mai avere con loro un dialogo e un confronto che si basi sulla ragione. <br>  E' capitato anche a me di discutere con qualcuno che bussava alla mia porta, ma ad un certo punto ho lasciato perdere perchè mi facevano pena e mi sono detta che il coraggio con il quale si buttavano nella mischia tentando di portare acqua al loro mulino andava premiato con un po' di compassione. <br>  E' facile in un dialogo a tu per tu metterli con le spalle al muro, ma serve? Io non credo perchè di persone con poche barriere intellettive ce ne sono molte e se non saranno preda della loro setta, lo saranno di altre perchè è di quello che hanno bisogno e convertiranno soltanto altri come loro, transfughi dal cattolicesimo, che non hanno capito, come non capiranno niente della dottrina dei testimoni di Geova, ma la seguiranno perchè un pastore qualsiasi per qualcuno è sempre meglio che essere pecore solitarie in mezzo ai lupi dai quali non si saprebbero difendere.|`|872793a648c9d44a8318bb3f3e3cd5d0aa	meglio cosi' stagli lontano|`|gFgbzux4aa	Caro Giuseppe, sono pienamente in accordo con te.

Io personalmente non chiedo mai a nessuno se è deluso della chiesa cattolica. Mi limito a esporre i fatti chiaramente insegnati nella Bibbia. Torno a visitare solo chi mostra un certo interesse. Se da te non sono tornati più, evidentemente questo interesse non l'hanno notato. Noi evitiamo le polemiche e i discorsi vuoti che non portano a niente, come dice <br>  2 Timoteo 2:24-25  “...Ma lo schiavo del Signore non ha bisogno di contendere, ma di essere gentile verso tutti, qualificato per insegnare, mantenendosi a freno nel male, istruendo con mitezza quelli che non sono favorevolmente disposti,...”<br>  <br>  <br>  Inoltre voglio dirti che se uno si converte, a noi non ci viene in tasca niente. La nostra opera è motivata soltanto dall'amore per Geova e per il prossimo. Se predichiamo la Buona Notizia del Regno è perché questa è un'opera che Cristo ha comandato.

67a63154ad765390dfa605efa98acc3daa	Hai ragione. <br>  In effetti i sacramenti, che sono il segno della volontà di vivere all'interno della propria fede, dovrebbero essere impartiti quando uno è in grado di esercitare la volontà. <br>  Vi sono ragioni storiche che hanno portato alla consuetudine di battezzare i bambini piccoli (Sant'Agostino), ma pian piano le cose stanno cambiando. <br>  Si tratta comunque sempre e soltanto di "segni" che manifestano l'appartenenza alla propria confessione religiosa. A volte si compiono anche in ambito laico, come certi rituali di iniziazione presenti in tutti i clan o club o tribù.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. Per Devol: parli di abusi intellettuali sui bambini. Vorrei farti osservare che i bambini possono anche essere abusati intellettualmente quando li si educa, per paradosso, al tifo per una squadra così come ad amare le rape che al bambino non piacciono, oppure ad andare in bicicletta quando il bambino preferisce il go-kart. Quando sarà adulto sceglierà la Juve al posto dell'Inter, le carote al posto della rape e, senza più sudare in biciletta, andrà sul go-kart. E si dimenticherà, volontariamente e liberamente, dell'abuso subito da piccolo.|`|ad6559518ee7ea2663bbb774b8106390aa	Riti religiosi: abusi intellettuali sui bambini<br>  <br>  E' difficile immaginare quante religioni attualmente in esistenza nel mondo sarebbero sopravvissute e tramandate secolo dopo secolo se fosse stato proibito d'insegnarle prima del 18mo anno di eta'.  <br>  <br>  Non esistono neonati cattolici, protestanti, mussulmani, buddisti, ebrei, eccetera, esistono adulti che inevitabilmente inculcano le loro tradizioni ai loro bambini dal momento che sono nati.  La religione, come la lingua che parliamo, ci viene imposta.  Non la scegliamo alla nascita.  Mentre imparare a parlare con la stessa lingua dei nostri genitori e del Paese in cui viviamo e' una capacita' essenziale per comunicare efficaciemente nella comunita' in cui viviamo, la religione ha la sola funzione di indottrinarci in certi pensieri filosofici mistici e di farceli accettare prima di svilluppare in pieno la nostra capacita' critica, che nel bambino e' sempre sottosviluppata.<br>  <br>  La facolta' critica del cervello umano e' quella di distinguere concetti contraddittori da quelli logici e risiede nel lobo frontale.  Il lobo frontale ha un lento periodo di sviluppo nella nostra specie.  Prima di raggiungere la completa maturita', infatti, questa parte del nostro cervello impiega circa 18 anni!  Ecco perche' in genere una persona non viene legalmente riconosciuta un adulto fino al raggiungimento di questa eta'.   Alcuni ragazzi maturano prima, altri un po' dopo, ma il globo frontale non e' mai maturo durante l'infanzia.  <br>  <br>  Ma e' proprio durante l'infanzia e l'adolescenza che le religioni vengono impartite come se fossero dei linguaggi ed il loro successo si trova proprio nell'approfittarsi di questo periodo di debolezza della mente.  Mentre il linguaggio non ha bisogno di passare attraverso la critica logica perche' e' un metodo convenzionale per formare i concetti e quindi da apprendere per via della memoria, i pensieri mistici religiosi dovrebbero essere valutati per decidere se sono veri o falsi.  I concetti mistici delle religioni descrivono cose che il bambino non puo' ne' capire, ne' farne esperienza.  Per esempio, gli adulti non possono dare al bambino ne' l'esperienza di Dio ne' la spiegazione logica della sua esistenza e il bambino e' costretto o ad evitare di pensare a cose che non capisce, o a chiedere spiegazioni e dimostrazioni piu' concrete.  In genere, i bambini vengono intimiditi e subliminalmente forzati ad accettare e conformarsi a tutti quei riti che gli adulti gli fanno fare.  Una volta memorizzate le parole ed i riti, anche senza senso reale come fanno i pappagalli, la gran parte dei bambini ha accettato implicitamente le convenzioni della religione che gli e' stata imposta, come ha accettato implicitamente la validita' di parlare italiano invece di russo.<br>  <br>  Questo e' un processo simile al lavaggio di cervello, solo che coi bambini e' piu' facile perche' non c'e' niente da "lavare" -- il cervello e' nuovo di zecca e ricettivo a qualsiasi cosa gli mettiamo dentro.<br>  <br>  Un giorno, quando l'umanita' sara' piu' evoluta intellettualmente, trovera' la pratica dell'indottrinamento della fede nei bambini (anziche' della ragione logica) una pratica primitiva, immorale e crudele, perche' insegnare ai bambini di credere senza evidenza sensoriale e senza prove logiche significa diminuire il valore del ragionamento e della capacita' della mente umana e quindi ritardare lo sviluppo del lobo frontale.|`|bead712ea7609b905511890ea80ffbbdaa	Non capisco dove sta il problema se sei ateo, non hai nessun sacramento secondo il tuo pensiero, perciò al massimo ti sono entrati dei regali poi siete andati al ristorante, adesso sei libero di fare quello che vuoi, il resto è stata una rimpatriata, con pranzi o cene.|`|e855599e3cb6ff96d617e5c785648ac2aa	Gesù disse "Chi avrà creduto e sarà stato battezzato, sarà salvato; ma chi non avrà creduto sarà condannato" (Marco16:16)<br>  Giustamente, come fa un neonato a credere prima di essere battezzato?<br>  E come si fa a sapere che un neonato non ha creduto e di conseguenza è condannato?<br>  Boh! saranno i misteri della fede?<br>  Credo che il battesimo si debba fare in età di ragione per rendere più coerente le parole di Gesù!|`|8vKIOXjwaa	concordo in pieno con quanto hai detto,  anch'io mi sono beccata battesimo-comunione-cresima contro la mia volontà, ma essendo atea quel po di acqua che mi hanno versato in testa non mi fa ne caldo ne freddo. l'unica cosa che veramente mi secca è che essendo battezzata rientravo nelle statistiche come cristiana-cattolica, così ho fatto una cosa molto semplice: mi sono "sbattezzata" ...ho chiesto, cioè,  al parroco di cancellarmi dal registro dei battezzati e adesso sono a posto con me stessa e con il mondo intero...|`|AecTXnM0aa	Io credo che se sei ateo e non credi in quello che ti gira nell'immanente, come potresti credere il trascendente? cmq segui il consiglio di Aliènor.

Nella mia parrocchia puoi cominciare a frequentare il corso di preparazione solo a 14 anni compiuti e puoi cresimarti all'età che vuoi tu, anche un anno prima del matrimonio.

RNyEQUQDaa	Yes, its 1 of many wherever our real God isnt being properly pursued thru His Son, Jesus Christ. Neither a label, title, name, its history, size of membership, amount of time it existed or claims made about them means anything (u can name anything anything). Its whats practiced that makes them either the whole truth or a lie. A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God's full definition or usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). 4 example, neither Jesus nor the Biblical prophets were ever muslims no matter whats claimed regarding an islam definition application 4 the word muslim (calling a dog god doesnt make it God).<br>  <br>  The real Jesus Christ (was never a muslim) is the only true way 2 salvation (Acts 4:12 - on an individual level) not Islam (God never sent Muhammud - no new prophets after Jesus, who cancels out the need 4 new prophets). Islam has nothing 2 do with knowing God. Its a man-made religion (only obvious 2 those who know the real Jesus Christ). Wrong teaching comes from false prophets, cancelling out anything they claim. When u dont know the real Jesus, accepting His death & resurrection & true position/Biblical teachings, the result is false teachings that kills u & ur offspring - theres many ways that seem right 2 men but its end = death (u cant worship in truth & in error - error cancels all u teach).<br>  <br>  The crux of the problem 4 most humans is man (having limited knowledge) tries 2 understand who God is by imposing human limitations 4 understand things 2 God's abilities. Muslims make the mistake of believing the Bible has many errors or is rewritten, that the koram is "the" perfect holy book). The Bible is only full of errors if u dont accept Jesus as God's real Son & if u r determined 2 make errors ur focal point so u can dismiss the Bible as the true word of God. God will give u what ur looking 4 in ur heart. Many r determined 2 dismiss God & will b given over 2 their hateful hardened heart. Muslims say the Qu'ran is perfect but it contains blatant fatal errors -<br>  <br>  The problem is theres many religions with different varieties/offshoots. 1 day I realized they cant all b right (ie. theres 1 Bible, why so many interpretations? - II Pet 1:**19-21). Most religions came thru people who thought up things 4 a God they & others liked. Some realized religion could b good 2 control the masses & 4 other agendas. Religion wont teach u much about God (they cant teach what they dont know). Who knows more about a house the Builder or he who moves in later?<br>  <br>  Religions made many fatal mistakes. However, do u think God is all knowing & there4, would fully understand His purpose, including 4 Jesus Christ? Many miss this - Jesus is the only 1 in history whom said He's "the" way, "the" truth & "the" life & NO 1 can know God except thru Jesus (Jn 14:6 - ref Acts 4:12; Jn 5:39; 10:1,7). This means "the" whole truth was complete & there4 finished thru what Jesus taught & did or God doesn't know what He's doing & cant b God. The truth is either fully true or its a lie. The full truth cant contain a lie & is the absence of any lie.<br>  <br>  Either Jesus is the only full truth or theres no actual truth & there4 no God (God would have 2 know what Jesus was going 2 do). This means Jesus is whom He says He is or He's just another false prophet among many, whom should b disregarded. If He's the actual truth then theres no need 4 any NEW teaching. This means any so-called new teaching & any other religious beliefs &/or from self-proclaimed prophets or teachers r invalid, null & void & cant lead u 2 our real God.<br>  <br>  ***If Jesus came from God as His only Son as stated in the Bible then the Quran (doesnt agree with the Bible), the Book of Mormon (no such thing as "another testament), JWs (rewrote some Bible verses - New World Translation) & other religions r wrong about Jesus b/c they demote Jesus 2 just a prophet or good man. If Jesus Christ isnt God's Son (false prophet) then the Bible & all others r wrong. We cant have it 2 ways. Theres only 1 Jesus & there can only be 1 true Gospel (II Cor 11:4; Gal 1:6,9; I Tm 6:3). If Jesus is whom He says He is then Muhammad (muslim follower of Islam), Joseph Smith (Mormon = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints), Jahovah's Witnesses (JWs = Watchtower), Most Catholics, many Protestants, Ellen White (7th Day Adventists), Mary Baker (Christian Scientists), the moonies (Unification church - Rev Moon), Church of Scientology (Dynanetics - L Ron Hubbard), Buddhism, Hinduism & others presenting other teachings & practices r the false prophets & teachers & should be disregarded. But I can assure u the truth is in the Bible (where Jesus was coming from in everything He did & said).<br>  <br>  [Many (see above par.) claim they believe Jesus is the Son of God (however, even the devil knows Jesus exists) but having read the entire Bible (some parts many times) I state with authority that many dont know God or Jesus. If ur foundation of teaching is wrong it cancels out all other claims u make = house built upon sand. Claiming Jesus is the Messiah doesnt mean u know the real Jesus Christ]<br>  <br>  Jesus couldnt have done nor said all thats written in the New Testament unless He fully knew the entire Old Testament (the NT didnt exist while Jesus was on earth). Jesus couldnt have known the entire OT unless God was with Him. & the Apostles couldnt remember & write down all thats in the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & understand what He was here 4 (Lk 24:25-27,45). Not possible unless an incredibly Intelligent Being caused it.<br>  <br>  But no matter how much many well-meaning people (religious or not) read the Bible they cant find Jesus Christ without going directly 2 Jesus thru His Biblical instructions (Jn 5:39; 10:1,7; 3:3,5). But God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant b properly understood without Jesus (Jn 14:6; II Cor 3:14; Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish people cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all the gentiles cant). Thats why theres so many interpretations & why many think its all fairy tales/a delusion (Jesus came bearing the sword of division).<br>  <br>  God doesnt compromise the truth - if u do u cancel out ur being a follower of the real truth & in turn that cancels ur place in Heaven.<br>  <br>  voyc4rmwldrns|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yes<br>  ___|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Cristians,Muslims and Jews all worship God just in different ways.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Nope,<br>  <br>  Satan knew that the true religion of Islam was coming, and to interrupt it, he staged Christianity because he knew millions could easily be deceived with it.<br>  <br>  Islam is the true religion and Christianity was the fake one.|`|IIhiSprlaa	...and what makes christianity so lovely?<br>  get the holy stick outta...<br>  nevermind.<br>  <br>  your religion is no better than mine, or anyone else's.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Any side that sees war as a solution is wrong.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	I find it unlikely|`|WdAuncq9aa	islam is peace but the media made him devil as you say i don't blame you if you keep watching CNN FOX NEWS  etc. you will hear only bad news about Islam<br>  <br>  for you Information 20,000 American convert to Islam every year most of the are very educated read quran them judge may Allah show his way Amen <br>  <br>  Successful indeed are the believers, (1) Who are humble in their prayers, (2) And who keep aloof from what is vain, (3) And who are givers of poor-rate, (4) And who guard their private parts, (5) Except before their mates or those whom their right hands possess, for they surely are not blameable, (6) But whoever seeks to go beyond that, these are they that exceed the limits; (7) And those who are keepers of their trusts and their covenant, (8) And those who keep a guard on their prayers; (9) These are they who are the heirs, (10) Who shall inherit the Paradise; they shall abide therein.

You will also find out which countries allow the death penalty only for "ordinary" crimes and which for things like treason.  You will also find the number of executions in the nations with the most executions. England does not allow the death penalty for any crimes.<br>  <br>  I am opposed to the death penalty on pragmatic grounds, based on looking at the death penalty system in action, in the US.<br>  <br>  130 people on death rows have been released with proof that they were wrongfully convicted. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. If someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. No reliable study shows the death penalty deters others. Homicide rates are higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. Life without parole costs less than the death penalty.<br>  <br>  The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, mostly because of the upfront costs of legal process which is supposed to prevent executions of innocent people. (upfront=pre trial and trial level)<br>   <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are not unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.<br>  <br>  Problems with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.njadp.org/forms/signon-survivor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.njadp.org/forms/signon-surviv...</a> for statements of victims’ families|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	no...England does not allow it thank goodness.  too many cases of corrupt police stitching up people & other miscarriages of justice have happened here for it to ever be allowed to return...and it truly will never return to the UK.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	2 helpful sites:<br>  <br>  www.deathpenaltyinfo.org<br>  www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  My own view, held for as long as I can remember, and certainly going back to the early 1960s, is that the death penalty is just plain wrong, and totally indefensible in any kind of civilised society.|`|vQi6HCMzaa	USA for sure<br>  Kill and u be killed<br>  Electric chair, death injection<br>  England doens't do it|`|tV3qgBLcaa	USA......TOO MANY....<br>  its wrong and murder...

TagWsrrsaa	Je suis chrétienne et praticante et je peux t'assurer que mon option est la troisième! Dieu permet la maladie parce que justement, c'est un moyen de se rapprocher de lui et de lui permettre de prendre concience qu'il est plus proche de nous quand on souffre. Son fils est mort pour nous sur la croix et cette souffrance est autant physique que psychologique et il l'a fait parce qu'il nous aime, faut pas juste regarder la maladie comme souffrance mais comme sens, c'est ce qui me dit que la maladie a un sens pour moi. Quand je suis malade, je vois un sens large de ce que j'ai, car je sais que je ne suis pas toute seule à souffrir et la souffrance a une source de joie.<br>  Et elle ne sert pas à rien pour un croyant, elle peut servir à plusieurs occasion d'aimer les autres autour et de leur dire leur importance.|`|seWZxCFSaa	Bonsoir Moustique!<br>  La maladie n' épargne personne et bien des raisons sont évoquées pour tenter de lui donner une signification.<br>  Biologiquement parlant la maladie survient quand nos défenses immunitaires sont débordée ou pour des raisons de dérèglement de l'organisme.

Il ne va pas permettre le mal non plus ce serait un non sens. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui révolte certain et avec juste raison. Alors comment trouver une réponse satisfaisante à la maladie mais plus largement au mal dans le monde.<br>  Le réponse me semble se placer dans le domaine de la philosophie car avec notre raison nous pouvons seul trouver une réponse intelligente et donc humaine.<br>  La souffrance la maladie, le mal existent et en eux même n'ont aucun sens et sont même une aberration. Cependant par la révolte bien naturelle qu'ils provoquent en nous ils nous placent dans une situation de le combattre et la fa?on la plus efficaces est de pratiquer la bonté. Et en cela il y a la une chose extraordinaire, c'est que toute personne humaine , croyante ou non, enfant,grandes personnes, homme ou femme, instruite ou non, peut pratiquer de ces geste de bonté <br>  comme donner un verre d'eau, aller voir un malade, donner à manger à un affamé, consoler...........<br>  Je te souhaite une très bonne année à toi, à tous ceux et celle que tu porte dans ton coeur avec de la joie et du bonheur!|`|aee1a8786622b773591b68bce59b64f0aa	Je dirai la 3.

Job supporte avec résignation la perte de ses biens, de ses enfants, ainsi que les souffrances de la maladie. Puis il supporte de même les réprimandes de trois de ses amis, sans renier une fois son Dieu.

Qu'il s'agisse de l'une ou de l'autre forme, Dieu est le Jéhovah Rapha pour guérir ( Psaumes 103:3; Esaie 53:3-5).

I feel the same way as you do.  |`|lklwmGh6aa	Maybe they cant afford a costume, give the kids some candy gimmie a break.  |`|Xtqq71KGaa	i totally agree.  it's even worse where i live.  i had 3 teenage boys show up- ONE of them had some makeup on his face- and none of them even had a bag.  they stretched out their shirts for me to drop the loot!  i told them that was what i considered begging.  i also had LOTS of adults with no kids anywhere in sight- some of the adults at least had costumes tho.  but there was one adult, no costume, and she had at least 7 plastic grocery bags.  they need to call it solicitation without fear of prosecution night instead of trick-or-treating.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	you  are  right  in  principle<br>  <br>  but  a  "no costume  no treat" policy  has  an implied consequence<br>  <br>  the  TRICK portion  of  "trick or  treat" <br>  <br>  it  is  a tradition of  older  kids  to  "t.p." or  "egg"  a house  with  unfavorable  treat  policies.  or  worse  the  "flaming  bag  of  poo"<br>  <br>  i'm  not  encouraging  it  but  it  is  the  way  of  things.<br>  <br>  you  need  to  know  this. beeing  a  hard@$$ for  the  sake  of  some  extra candy is  not  worth  that. <br>  <br>  either  suck  it  up  and  buy  tons  of  cheaper  candy or just  decide  to  be  out  that  night|`|f6YsGOynaa	My 13 year old son wanted to go trick or treating without a costume and I told him NO WAY.  He stayed home and handed out candy instead.  <br>  <br>  When the older kids come by without costumes, I ask them where their costume is.  If they have a creative answer for being dressed in every day clothes, I'll give them candy.  If they just stand there looking stupid, I will give them something small and yucky that nobody likes.  I save the raisins just for these kids. <br>  <br>  "I'm an honor student, but just for the day," or "I'm a lazy teenager" will even fly with me, as long as it makes me smile.  <br>  <br>  The whole game is "trick or treat" so if they want a treat, make them do a trick.
XN0cYCATaa	This question is logically problematic. If everything needs a creator, than no matter what exists, it must have been created.  Furthermore, to be created means that someone or something had to create it.  But then, who created the creator and so on?  Logically, this would mean there would be an infinite regression of creators and we would never be able to find the first, uncaused cause since, by definition (the questions says that "everything needs a creator") there wouldn't be any uncaused cause.  This would mean that the sequence of creations is eternal.  But, if it exists that there is an eternal regression of creators, then who created the infinite regression of creators?  Remember, the question presupposes that all things need a creator -- even the eternal sequence of creators -- which becomes logically absurd.  Furthermore, if there is an eternal regression of creators that are eternal, then the question is not answered.  In fact, it cannot be answered since it weakness is that "all things need a creator."  Of course, this only begs the question in that how did the process begin? Therefore, the question only raises the same problem it asks and it is a question that, by its own design, cannot be answered.  Therefore, it is invalid.<br>       The question is better phrased as a statement: "Everything that has come into existence, was brought into existence by something else."  This is a more logical statement and is not wrought with the difficulties of the initial question.  In the revised statement "Everything that has come into existence," implies that the thing that "has come into existence" did not already exist. If it did not already exist but then came into existence, then something had to bring it into existence because something that does not exist cannot bring itself into existence (a logical absolute).  This pushes the regression of creators back to what we would call the theoretical "uncaused cause" since there cannot be an infinite regression of creators as discussed above and since in infinite number of creators would mean there was an infinite number of creations and created things including things that cannot be destroyed since they would constitute things that exist.  If that is so, then the universe would have had an infinite number of created things in it and it would be full.  But it is not full.  Therefore, there has not been an infinite regression of creations.<br>        By definition, the Christian God never came into existence; that is, He is the uncaused cause (Psalm 90:2).  He was always in existence and He is the one who created space, time, and matter. This means that the Christian God is the uncaused cause and is the ultimate creator.  This eliminates the infinite regression problem.<br>       But some may ask, "But who created God?"  But the answer is that by definition He is not created; He is eternal.  He is the One who brought time, space, and matter into existence. Since the concept of causality deals with space, time, and matter, and since God is one who brought space, time, and matter into existence, the concept of causality does not apply to God since it is something related to the reality of space, time, and matter.  Since God is before space, time, and matter, the issue of causality does not apply to Him.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	The Metagod|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Men. <br>  <br>  Why do you think religion is so male orientated.|`|vddPsXzIaa	The idea of God is inherent in people. Psychologists have proven this. We know only a few things about God. One of them is that nobody crated Him. He has been forever. You can see that nowadays people are loosing faith and the world is sinking into chaos and anarchy.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Nobody created God. He was there from the beginning - well, before then, actually.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	who creates time and space.. It just was and is,, God  is not a person, he is not created...|`|cIPziIdnaa	Yes, He sure did.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	This question which you have asked is inherently false and self-contradictory. If we were to say – for the sake of argument – that someone created God, then they would ask you, Who created the creator of the creator? Then, who created the creator of the creator of the creator?! And so on, ad infinitum. This is irrational and impossible.<br>  <br>  All of creation goes back to the Creator Who created all things. No one created Him; He created everything other than Himself. This is what makes sense and is logical. This creator is God, may He be glorified and exalted.<br>  <br>  We know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)<br>  <br>  With regard to what our religion tells us, the Prophet (peace and blessings of God be upon him) told us about this question, where it comes from, and how to respond to it.<br>  <br>  Muhammad, the last Messenger of God (peace and blessings of God be upon him) said: “The Satan will come to one of you and say, ‘Who created such and such?’ until he says to him, ‘Who created your Lord?’ When it reaches that stage, let him seek refuge with God saying (I seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Satan) and stop thinking about it.” [Allah means "The God" in Arabic].<br>  <br>  The Messenger of God (peace and blessings of God be upon him) said: “People will keep on asking question until someone will say, ‘Allaah created the universe, but who created Allaah?’ Whoever encounters anything like that, let him say, ‘Amantu Billaah (I believe in Allaah).’” <br>  <br>  In these sayings of the Prophet we see:<br>  <br>  Where this question comes from – from the Satan;<br>  <br>  How to deal with it, which is:<br>  <br>  to stop pursuing these thoughts and these tricks of the Satan.<br>  <br>  to say, “I believe in Allaah and All His Messengers”<br>  <br>  to seek refuge with Allaah from the Satan.<br>  <br>  3. With regard to the prior existence of Allaah, our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us about this, for example:<br>  <br>  He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Allaah, You are the First and there is nothing before You; O Allaah, You are the Last and there is nothing after You.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2713)<br>  <br>  He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah existed when there was nothing apart from Him.” According to another report: “There was nothing before Him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari; the first report 3020; the second report 6982).<br>  <br>  This is in addition to what is stated in the verses of the Qur’aan. The believer believes without a doubt, the non-believer denies and the hypocrite doubts. We ask Allaah to grant us sincere and certain faith with no doubts. And Allaah is the Source of strength.|`|ccOJn7q8aa	ajmustee said "God is what we consider to be the creator of time and space.

bYXz6xJcaa	I was best friends with girls all thru school, and I remember taking showers together even at your age, but it was never sexual.  Girls often are touchy feely, even into high school, doing each other's hair, etc... but they may not be thinking about sex.  This girl doesn't sound like she is thinking sex, she just sounds like a typical junior high school girl, and if you admit anything to her, you might risk being rejected or worse.  I'd wait to say anything until you have more facts that point to her being bi or les, but that's just my thoughts.  Good luck!|`|grYkoDaraa	eye contact could mean anything.  she could like you but she could also not.  things just get so confusing in 8th grade because most people don't know they are bi/gay until they are older.  i think it could go either way but unless you are willing for the whole school to know you are bi then i wouldn't say anything because in school news travels fast.  |`|tV3qgBLcaa	youre way too young to be making such decisions....please get some counseling from a priest or minister....|`|lM1XPoYPaa	ok; you are way too young to know if youre bi or not. maybe you just really want to be this girls friend. you need to wait until your older to be thinking about this stuff.|`|AA10428869	you are in 8th grade enjoy the friendship|`|ruiF2vxEaa	I think she smile at you just for good manners.

Tml8ARwGaa	Yo tengo muchos amigos y familia que son Testigos de Jehova y lo que ellos creen respecto al tema de los cielos, vida eterna e infierno es el siguiente:<br>  <br>  Hay unos textos biblicos que hablan de que un grupo de 144,000 que es el rebano pequeno, es que ira al cielo.<br>  <br>  Hay otro grupo que es una gran muchedumbre, que son los que viviran para siempre en la tierra. Que Dios quiso un paraiso en un principio y que de el no salen palabras sin cumplirse, asi que la tierra sera un paraiso y que la gran muchedumbre vivira en la tierra hecha paraiso.<br>  <br>  El infierno como un lugar de tormento eterno no existe. Que Satanas como el primer pecador, tambien sera destruido en el futuro junto a todas las demas personas, o sea que no hay un infierno de lamento eterno sino que solo son destruidos y ya. Que la confusion de el infierno con llamas viene del pasado, que muchos traductores confundian las palabras de Seol y Hades con Gehena, que fue un lugar en las fueras de Jerusalem donde siempre habia fuego y alli tiraban las cosas para destruirlas, pero tambien cuando habia un criminal, lo mataban y sus restos los tiraban en ese lugar llamado Gehena porque un criminal no tenia derecho a una "Santa Sepultura", para que no descansara en paz, por decirlo asi. <br>  <br>  Se que a algunos no onos parecen algunas creencias actuales sobre ellos, pero mi opinion es que es interesante investigar todo tipo de religion para sacar conclusiones y las creencias que tienen los Testigos de Jehova usualmente tienen una investigacion profunda. La creemos? Talvez no, pero si es interesante leerlo todo profundamente. <br>  <br>  Yo a pesar de no ser Testigo de Jehova, si concuerdo con ellos de que no existe un infierno de fuego, para empezar si Dios es un Dios de amor, el no permitiria que hubiera un lugar tan sufrido como el infierno. Ademas eso le daria vida de por vida al diablo para hacer lo que el quiere y realmente si el peco ante Dios, entonces el tambien deberia ser destruido.<br>  <br>  Para los que creen en el infierno, solo les invito a que sigan investigando del tema, no solo de los libros de su religion, investiguen mas temas, incluso en enciclopedias que tienen un punto de vista laico.<br>  Saludos,|`|41fc7f1fd75de3804683f56d513c55a4aa	Es buena tu pregunta, pro no se trata de lo que nosotros creamos, si no de lo que dice la biblia al respecto, y es algo totalmente sencillo de entender<br>  <br>  1oCuando la pra pareja pecó, el castigo fué ...muerte.ausencia de vida . fin de todo.<br>  <br>  (Génesis 2:16-17) .?.?.. 17?Pero en cuanto al árbol del conocimiento de lo bueno y lo malo, no debes comer de él, porque en el día que comas de él, positivamente morirás”.<br>  <br>  2oCristo vino a saldar esa deuda que teiamos con el,y con el obtuvimos la esperanza de la resurrección para todo aquel que le siguiera, incluso a fieles siervos del pasado<br>  <br>  (Juan 5:27-29) .?.?.. 28?No se maravillen de esto, porque viene la hora en que todos los que están en las tumbas conmemorativas oirán su voz 29?y saldrán, los que hicieron cosas buenas a una resurrección de vida, los que practicaron cosas viles a una resurrección de juicio.<br>  <br>  Claramente dice donde están los muertos, en las tumbas,<br>  cosa que corrobora .<br>  <br>  (Eclesiastés 9:5) 5?Porque los vivos tienen conciencia de que morirán; pero en cuanto a los muertos, ellos no tienen conciencia de nada en absoluto, ni tienen ya más salario, porque el recuerdo de ellos se ha olvidado.<br>  <br>  Alma somos nosotros mismos, no "algo" que tenemos dentro<br>  <br>  (Génesis 2:7) 7?Y Jehová Dios procedió a formar al hombre del polvo del suelo y a soplar en sus narices el aliento de vida, y el hombre vino a ser alma viviente. <br>  <br>  Todas las almas o vidas que no sean dignas del reino, simplemente no resucitarán y el castigo no es más que la muerte eterna.<br>  <br>  La biblia dice que Dios es Amor ?seria compatible con un Dios de amor calcinar eternamente a aquellos que no fueron capaces de obedecerle? además ,el concepto de alma que tienen muchas religiones es algo incorporeo , inmaterial, el fuego no lo es.?podria arder?<br>  <br>  Mira lo que piensa Dios mismo de esta practica pagana :<br>  <br>  (Jeremías 7:30-31) .?.?.. 31?Y han edificado los lugares altos de Tófet, que está en el valle del hijo de Hinón, a fin de quemar a sus hijos y sus hijas en el fuego, cosa que yo no había mandado y que no había subido a mi corazón.’<br>  <br>  ?ves? ni siquiera subio a su corazón llevar a cabo semejante atrocidad.<br>  <br>  El alma (o nosotros)muere :<br>  <br>  (Ezequiel 18:4) 4??Miren! Todas las almas... a mí me pertenecen. Como el alma del padre, así igualmente el alma del hijo... a mí me pertenecen. El alma que peca... ella misma morirá.<br>  <br>  Además cuando morimos ,con nuestra muerte pagamos nuestros pecados<br>  <br>  (Romanos 6:7) 7?Porque el que ha muerto ha sido absuelto de [su] pecado.<br>  <br>  Unica esperanza verdadera resurrección en la tierra, a una vida que verdaderamente lo es, la vida que Jehová quiso desde un principio y que Satanas frustro por un poco de tiempo.<br>  <br>  (Revelación 21:2-4) .?.?.. 3?Con eso, oí una voz fuerte desde el trono decir: “?Mira! La tienda de Dios está con la humanidad, y él residirá con ellos, y ellos serán sus pueblos. Y Dios mismo estará con ellos. 4?Y limpiará toda lágrima de sus ojos, y la muerte no será más, ni existirá ya más lamento ni clamor ni dolor. Las cosas anteriores han pasado”.<br>  <br>  Ch|`|3dIaiV3Eaa	Por que soy testigo de Jehova, soy adecuada para responderte a tu interesante pregunta. <br>  <br>  Ezequiel 18:4 dice que toda alma que peca, ella misma morirá. Es decir, que el alma muere junto con el cuerpo, el alma no viaja a ningun lugar. Cuando Dios creó al hombre, en Genesis 2:7  se dice que el "hombre vino a SER alma viviente" . No dice que TUVO un alma.  Lo puedes comprobar en tu misma Biblia, no importa que traducción tengas.<br>  Cuando morimos, todos vamos al "Seol" segun Ecleseastes 9:10. Se menciona que es un estado de inexistencia e inactividad. Seol es lo mismo que infierno. La palabra "infierno" sustituyó a la palabra "seol" en la King James version Bible. Siendo así exactamente lo mismo.<br>  <br>  El espíritu, no es lo mismo que el alma, el espíritu es la fuerza de vida, por así decirlo , y este le da vida al alma. El espíritu regresa a su fuente, a Jehova Dios, según Ecleseastes 12:7. Te vuelvo a mencionar, puedes buscar las citas bíblicas en tu propia traducción de la Biblia.<br>  <br>  La Biblia promete una resurreccion de justos y de injustos en Juan 5:28.29.<br>  Me encanta tu pregunta, puedes ir a www.watchtower.org O puedes perguntar a los testigos que visiten a tu casa, preguntales, puesto que es un tema muy extenso.

Y hay que irse haciendo a la idea y dejarse de fantasías multicolores.|`|S9NBHmKjaa	Cuando Jacob estuvo lamentándose por su amado hijo José, a quien creía que habían matado, dijo: “?Porque en duelo bajaré a donde mi hijo, al Seol!” (Génesis 37:35) Sin embargo, aquí la Versión Valera de 1934 traduce la palabra Sheol como “sepultura,” mientras que la Versión Douay, una versión católica en inglés, la traduce “hell,” que sería “infierno.” Ahora, deténgase un momento y piense. ?Creía Jacob que su hijo José hubiera ido a un lugar de tormento a pasar la eternidad allí, y deseaba entonces ir allá para encontrarse con él? ?No era, más bien, que Jacob simplemente creía que su amado hijo estaba muerto y en el sepulcro y que Jacob mismo quería morir?<br>  <br>  8 Sí, la gente buena va al infierno bíblico. Por ejemplo, el buen hombre Job, quien estaba sufriendo muchísimo, oró a Dios: “?Oh que en el Seol [sepulcro, Versión Valera de 1934; infierno, Versión Scío de San Miguel] me ocultases, . . . que me fijaras un límite de tiempo y te acordaras de mí!” (Job 14:13) Piense ahora: Si Seol significara un lugar de fuego y tormento, ?hubiera querido Job ir a aquel lugar y pasar su tiempo allí hasta que Dios se acordara de él? Está claro que Job deseaba morir e ir al sepulcro para no sufrir más.<br>  <br>  9 En todos los lugares donde se menciona al Seol en la Biblia, jamás está asociado con vida, actividad ni tormento o tortura. Más bien, suele estar relacionado con muerte e inactividad. Por ejemplo, piense en Eclesiastés 9:10, que dice: “Todo lo que tu mano halle que hacer, hazlo con tu mismísimo poder, porque no hay trabajo ni formación de proyectos ni conocimiento ni sabiduría en el Seol [sepulcro, Versión Valera (1934); “hell” o infierno, Versión Douay], el lugar adonde estás yendo.” De modo que la respuesta queda muy clara. Seol y Hades no se refieren a un lugar de tormento, sino al sepulcro o sepultura común de la humanidad. (Salmo 139:8) Tanto las personas buenas como las malas van al infierno bíblico.<br>  lo DE ARRIBA ES NUESTRA OPINION SOBRE EL INFIERNO...<br>  sobre las personas que no seah como dices merecedoras..pues seran destruidas..osea que  moriran..y en la Biblia dice que los muertos estan en el seol..o infierno..que es el sepulcro comun de la humanidad|`|SrHxNDRkaa	Todo son chorradas, con todos los respestos hacia los creyentes por supuesto, para mí no existe, ni Dios, ni Alá, ni Jehová, ni Buda.... y por ende ni cielo, ni infierno. Todo esto es cuestión de lo que se nos inculca desde peque?o, por educación y cultura, pero en realidad cuando morimos, simplemente dejamos de existir, desaparecemos, pasamos al mismo estado que teníamos antes de ser concebidos, es decir la nada absoluta, ?Alguien recuerda algo de su vida antes de ser un espermatozoide?, pués ese mismo estado  va a tener cuando se muera. El ser humano cree en esto por que no tiene razón de existir por si mismo y por tanto el ser superior que da razón de existir a los seres humanos es "Dios" o como quieran llamarlo.

Este nombre se deriva del heb. ge?(ben)(b?ne?) hinnoμm, valle (del hijo/de los hijos) de Hinom, valle cercano a Jerusalén (Jos. 15.8; 18.16) en el que se sacrificaban ni?os pasándolos por el fuego como parte de ciertos ritos paganos (2 R. 23.10; 2 Cr. 28.3; 33.6; Jer. 7.31; 32.35). Su derivación original es oscura, pero es casi seguro que Hinom fuese el nombre de alguna persona. En escritos judíos posteriores gehena llegó a significar el lugar de castigo para los pecadores. Se lo describía como un lugar de fuego inextinguible; la idea general del fuego como modo de expresar el juicio divino se encuentra en el AT (Dt. 32.22; Dn. 7.10). La literatura rabínica contiene diversas opiniones acerca de quién sufriría el castigo eterno. Era común pensar que los sufrimientos de algunos terminarían mediante la aniquilación, y que el fuego de la gehena en ciertos casos era un purgatorio. Pero los que sostenían estas doctrinas también ense?aban la realidad del castigo eterno para ciertas clases de pecadores. Tanto esta literatura como la apócrifa afirman la creencia en una retribución eterna.<br>  <br>  La ense?anza del NT apoya esta antigua creencia. El fuego del infierno es inextinguible (Mr. 9.43) y eterno (Mt. 18.8), y su castigo es lo opuesto a la vida eterna (Mt. 25.46). No se supere en ninguna parte que los que entran al infierno volverán a salir de allí algún día. No obstante, el NT permite la posibilidad de que, si bien el infierno como manifestación de la ira implacable de Dios contra el pecado es infinita, puede no serlo la existencia de quienes sufren en él. Resulta difícil reconciliar el cumplimiento final de todo el universo en Cristo (Ef. 1.10; Col. 1.20) con la imperecedera existencia de los que lo rechazan. Algunos entendidos han afirmado que castigo eterno es el que lo es en sus efectos; de cualquier manera, eterno no necesariamente significa que no tendrá fin, sino que quiere decir, "larga duración que se extiende hasta el horizonte mental del escritor". Por otra parte, Ap. 20.10 indica un tormento consciente y sin fin para el diablo y sus agentes, aunque en un pasaje altamente simbólico, y algunos hasta afirmarían que un fin semejante espera a los seres humanos que en última instancia se niegan a arrepentirse. De cualquier modo, no debe permitirse que nada desmerezca la seriedad de las advertencias de nuestro Se?or acerca de la terrible realidad del juicio de Dios en el mundo venidero.<br>  <br>  En Stg. 3.6 la gehena, como el pozo del abismo de Ap. 9.1ss; 11.7, aparece como la fuente del mal en la tierra.<br>  <br>  Las metáforas neotestamentarias sobre el castigo eterno no son uniformes. Además de fuego, se lo describe como tinieblas (Mt. 25.30; 2 P. 2.17), muerte (Ap. 2.11), perdición y exclusión de la presencia del Se?or (2 Ts. 1.9; Mt. 7.21–23), y una deuda que hay que pagar (Mt. 5.25–26).<br>  <br>  Solamente en 2 P. 2.4 encontramos el verbo tartarooμ, traducido como "arrojar al infierno", y en otras versiones "arrojar a las regiones inferiores". Tartaros es la palabra clásica para el lugar de castigo eterno, pero aquí se la aplica a la esfera intermedia de castigo para los angeles caídos.|`|SQHLQ0jeaa	Osea ke si dice la biblia hey bola de babosos tirense aun pozo <br>  <br>  Hay van todos los babosos ke leen esa cosa a tirarse al pozo<br>  <br>  por favor vivan la vida, ke si dios nos la dio es para ke la disfrutemos y no estemos ahi de barberos ganandose el cielo o jalada y media <br>  <br>  la vida se vive una vez hay k vivirla almaximo<br>  <br>  aah si se me olvida <br>  <br>  <br>  los TJ aburren =D|`|VSRt2uZCaa	Los TJ's inventan muchas necedades, no te podrán responder nada que pueda tener sustento|`|X7VbzPhTaa	Ellos dicen que Dios es un Dios de amor y que: Como Dios va a mandar a un lugar así a sus hijos?. Luego te preguntan: Tu mandarías a un hijo tuyo a un lugar así? Verdad que no lo mandarías a ese lugar? En fin no creen que hay vida después de la muerte, ya sea en un lugar de tormento o en un lugar de reposo con Dios. Entonces para que vino Jesucristo a padecer y a morir? Si no existiera ese lugar de tormento eterno? Para que salen a vender  o a repartir sus revistas? Alguien de ellos dijo que dice que "el alma que pecare esa morirá" El texto de Ezequiel 18:2 y 3 esta hablando de Israel, no le esta hablando a las demás naciones por que las demás naciones tenían sus propios dioses. El texto completo dice: "Ezequiel 18:4 He aquí que todas las almas son mías; como el alma del padre, así el alma del hijo; el alma que pecare esa morirá."  Ahora dice: en Romanos 3:21-24, 21- Pero ahora, aparte de la ley, se ha manifestado la justicia de Dios, testificada por la ley y por los profetas; 22- la justicia de Dios por medio de la fe en Jesucristo, para todos los que creen en él. Porque no hay diferencia, 23- por cuanto todos pecaron, y están destituidos de la gloria de Dios, 24-siendo justificados gratuitamente por su gracia, mediante, la redención que es en Cristo Jesús."  La salvacion que da Jesucristo es gratis solamente tenemos que creer en el. Bueno las revistas ellos las tienen que pagar y si no las pagan les van guardando su credito hasta que paguen. Ellos(tdj)tienen que hacer horas vendiendo sus revistas de calle en calle o parados en alguna esquina para hacer muchas horas para que Jehova los mire y tenga de ellos compasion y no se queden en el sepulcro cuando mueran como ellos dicen que ahi se termina sus vidas SEGUN ELLOS. Saludos..........|`|b49337d2a07dad2c574653f8add7926faa	Bueno la respuesta tiene en si una cuestion doctrinal basica en esta organización, en primer lugar se divide lo que es cuerpo físico de lo que es cuerpo espiritual , eso es por lo que dice la biblia:"si hay cuerpo físico, tambien lo hay espiritual".<br>  Que quiero desir con esto...?.Bueno me refiero a que la inmortalidad del 'alma ' no es algo ense?ado en esta organización.Aqui se ense?a que todos SOMOS almas vivientes al contrario del concepto popular de TENER un alma.<br>  Se explica que la unión del cuerpo de carne y sangre junto al aliento de vida (el que entra mediante la respiracion desde que nasemos ) nos convierte en criaturas hechas de carbono  <br>  pero con energia de vida , proveniente de Dios claro esta.<br>  Al contrario las creaturas de cuerpo espiritual (Dios , Jesucristo , los angeles y los del otro bando), son seres de <br>  CUERPO ESPIRITUAL  que tambien son ALMAS vivientes pero en su caso enteramente de energia de vida (o energia divina).Es por esta ense?anza doctrinal o biblica (como ellos te aclararían)que no creen en que ningun alma pueda ir a un infierno porque no existen aparte del cuerpo , sino que somo tales durante el tienpo que estemos vivos , por eso la biblia aclara en muchos pasaje ,por ejemplo que sangra. que muere o que sufre, tambien a los animales se les llama en la biblia ALMAS VIVIENTES.<br>  Es por ello , que el infierno no es mostrado como posibilidad <br>  porque en el lenguaje original de la biblia (hebreo,arameo y el "griego Koine")la expresion que algunas traducciones ponen como "infierno", significan literalmente en esos lenguajes sepulcro,tumba,("sheol":hebreo,"ades":gr...<br>  Tambien se habla de una resurreccion de vida y una resurreccion de juicio,no te olvides que Jesucristo hera un judio practicante que aparte de cumplir enteramente con las profecias que hablaban de su venida, Les estaba hablando a una nacion (como la Judia) que no creian en la recompensa celestial sino en lo que llamo la hermana de Lazaro ANTES que fuese resusitado por Jesus :" 'yo se que lo vere en la resurreccion en el último dia' ".Esto te da una idea de que los Judios no creian en un infierno ni en un cielo como recompensa, mas bien esperaban el futuro juicio de Dios en forma individual mediante la futura resurreccion de la que Lazaro solo fue un adelanto o ejemplo de lo que pasaria en el ultimo dia,como dice el apocalipsis:"y el mar entrego los muertos que habia en el y la Muerte y el Hades todos los que habia en ella"|`|efFbHcYwaa	yo cuando me muera me voy a ir a un boliche!! se va a llamar AL ROJO VIVO!! quien quiere venir? tragos gratis|`|kzds9KPSaa	los testigos de jeova? es una religion equibocada|`|oAGWz3n4aa	se supone que en el infierno vivie Satanas, pero Dios destruira  a Satanas entonces sin satanas no hay infierno <br>  <br>  solo habra una resureccion de muertos justos(que en vida demostraron ser fieles a Dios) e injustos (que no hayan oido de jehova) ha estas ultimas se les predicara y si las  personas  no quieran seguirlo simplemente moriran para siempre <br>  no hay tormentos despues de la muerte, como puede creerse eso despues que jehova mismo dice que el es un dios de amor.<br>  <br>  y para quien dice que no sabemos de donde viene la palabra  o que Dios no se llama  Jehova.<br>  <br>  El nombre de Dios y los traductores de la Biblia<br>  <br>  A PRINCIPIOS del siglo segundo, después de la muerte del último de los apóstoles, empezó en serio el apostatar de la fe cristiana predicho por Jesús y sus seguidores. Filosofías y doctrinas paganas se infiltraron en la congregación; surgieron sectas y divisiones, y la pureza original de la fe fue corrompida. Y el nombre de Dios dejó de usarse.<br>  <br>  A medida que este cristianismo apóstata se esparció, surgió la necesidad de traducir la Biblia de sus idiomas originales, hebreo y griego, a otros. ?Cómo vertieron los traductores el nombre de Dios en sus traducciones? Por lo general usaron el equivalente de “Se?or”. Una versión muy influyente de aquel tiempo fue la Vulgata latina, una traducción de la Biblia por Jerónimo al latín de uso cotidiano. Jerónimo vertió el Tetragrámaton (YHWH) mediante el sustitutivo Dominus, “Se?or”.<br>  <br>  Con el tiempo, en Europa empezaron a surgir idiomas nuevos, tales como el francés, el inglés y el espa?ol. Sin embargo, la Iglesia Católica presentó oposición a traducir la Biblia a estos nuevos idiomas. Por eso, a la vez que los judíos, que usaban la Biblia en el lenguaje hebreo original, rehusaban pronunciar el nombre de Dios cuando lo veían, la mayoría de los “cristianos” oían la Biblia leída en traducciones al latín que no usaban el nombre.<br>  <br>  Con el tiempo, el nombre de Dios volvió a utilizarse. En?1278 apareció en latín en la obra Pugio fidei (Defensa de la fe), por Ramón Martí, un monje espa?ol. Ramón Martí usó la grafía Yohoua. Poco después, en?1303, Porcheto de Selvaticis completó una obra titulada Victoria Porcheti adversus impios Hebraeos (La victoria de Porcheto contra los impíos hebreos). En esta obra él, también, mencionó el nombre de Dios, y lo escribió de varias maneras: Iohouah, Iohoua y Ihouah. Después, en?1518, Pietro di Galatino publicó una obra titulada De arcanis catholicae veritatis (Sobre secretos de la verdad universal) en la cual escribe el nombre de Dios Iehoua.<br>  <br>  El nombre apareció por primera vez en una Biblia inglesa en?1530, cuando William Tyndale publicó una traducción de los primeros cinco libros de la Biblia. En ésta él puso el nombre de Dios, por lo general escrito Iehouah, en varios versículos, y en una nota para esta edición escribió: “Iehovah es el nombre de Dios [...] Además, cada vez que se vea SE?OR en letras grandes (excepto cuando haya algún error en la impresión) es, en hebreo, Iehovah”. De aquí, en las versiones en inglés surgió la práctica de usar el nombre de Jehová (Jehovah) en solamente algunos versículos y escribir “LORD” (SE?OR) o “GOD” (DIOS) en la mayoría de los demás lugares donde aparece el Tetragrámaton en el texto hebreo.|`|pdK3iuO8aa	cuando no vas al cielo vas a la cera de los oidos de menem|`|vUnnjQ1qaa	TODA RELIGIóN ES BUENA, EN TANTO Y EN CUANTO NO ESCLAVISE AL HOMBRE.|`|zplFkENFaa	Como dije antes, el infierno es la sepultura común, en ese sentido todo el que muere vá a un infierno.  Lo que pasa es<br>  que en la antigüedad, un Papa, inventó que el infierno era un <br>  lugar de fuego eterno,donde Dios castigaba a los pecadores. Lo inventó así, porque había un se?or hacendado muy  rico, y  muy  enfermo, al cual le dijo que<br>  si él le donaba sus riquezas a los pobres, el como sacerdote<br>  se comprometía a rogar por su alma toda su vida y salvarlo de ir al infierno.<br>  Si analizamos todo este discurso, encontraremos que:<br>  <br>  1o    Mintió.porque el infierno es frío (la sepultura) .-<br>  2o    Mintió cuando dijo que iba a rogar por su alma, porque<br>          no se necesita rogar por nadie que muera, ya que la<br>          Biblia ense?a en Romanos cap. 6: 7, que el que<br>          muere es absuelto de su pecado.-<br>   3o    Mintió y pecó contra Dios al decir que Dios mandaba<br>           a los pecadores al infierno.<br>   4o    Pecó de codicia (Lucas 12:15) al desear los bienes <br>           ajenos.<br>           Bueno para acortarte la historia, el catolicismo es <br>           una ESTAFA ESPIRITUAL  en muchos sentidos, y<br>           sólo logra zafarse de  este embrollo, el que estudia la<br>            Biblia.-<br>  Para cooperarte con otra "perlita" de estos falsos profetas<br>  como los llama la Biblia, podrías entrar en un Grupo Google<br>  donde se cuentan muchas historias de ellos:   Por ej. mira<br>  en : es.charla.religión       Después ubica en el encabezado:<br>  xandas Bolas y cliquea para que veas lo que cuenta...!

LA ICAR TIENE UNA CABEZA QUE NO ES CRISTO ,ES PEDRO Y LOS PAPAS.<br>  1 - Es falso que la Biblia condene las verdades protestantes, pues cuando se escribió la Biblia, el protestantismo no había surgido. ERROR  DE LA ICAR.<br>  2 -Conoces a cabalidad la ense?anza protestante? La has confrontado con la Biblia y no con LAS TRADICIONES Y ENCICLICAS PAPALES? 2 ERROR.<br>  3 - La Biblia dice que no es de interpretación privada, si eso es así porqué la ICAR si la interpreta a su ama?o cambiandole y quitandole muchas verdades que no les conviene o mezclándole ense?anza que la Biblia no respalda?  Ya te lo probaré.<br>  3 -No he escuchado a los protestantes decir que cualquiera puede entender las escrituras menos la ICAR. ERROR.<br>  4 - NUNCA Jesús dijo que su iglesia la edificaría sobre Pedro.(esa es una interpretación acomodada por la ICAR.) Hay que leer el texto y el contexto para no caer en un pretexto. JESUS DIJO: SOBRE ESTA PIEDRA EDIFICARE MI IGLESIA, La piedra eran las palabras que El padre Eterno le revelo a Pedro: TU ERES EL CRISTO, EL HIJO DEL DIOS VIVIENTE, esa es la piedra. ERROR.<br>  5 - Cuando Jesús dijo esas palabras la ICAR NO EXISTIA, esta nació 3 siglos despues en Roma ( ciudad pagana) y fue fundada por Constantino ( lease la Historia de la Iglesia católica ).<br>  6 - Las llaves del Reino fueron dadas a los apóstoles,y luego a toda la iglesia en la Gran Comisión. pero sabes cuales son las llaves del Reino?  te lo dejo de tarea.<br>  7 - Tengo autoridad suficiente para conocer las ense?anzas de la ICAR, por haberlas estudiado por cerca de 25 a?os y haber sido lider mucho tiempo en ella.<br>  8 - Quien dirigió la iglesia despues de la partida de Jesús no fue Pedro, si observa con cuidado, quien presidió este primer concilio fue JACOBO y no Pedro.    Hechos 15:13  Cuando ellos callaron,  Jacobo respondió diciendo:  <br>   --Hermanos,  oídme.<br>  Hech 15:14  Simón ha contado cómo Dios visitó por primera vez a los gentiles para tomar de ellos pueblo para su nombre.<br>  Hechos  15:19  "Por lo cual yo juzgo que no se inquiete a los gentiles que se convierten a Dios,<br>  Hecht 15:20  sino que se les escriba que se aparten de las contaminaciones de los ídolos,  de fornicación,  de ahogado y de sangre. Quien juzgó  sobre el caso Pedro o Jacobo?. Otra prueba de que Pedro no era el lider es que Pablo lo reprendió por comer con los Gentiles. <br>  Gal 2:11  Pero cuando Pedro vino a Antioquía, lo reprendí cara a cara,  porque era de condenar,<br>  Gal 2:12  pues antes que llegaran algunos de parte de Jacobo,  comía con los gentiles; pero después que llegaron,  se retraía. Era Pedro el lider de la Iglesia? NO.<br>  9 - Jesús nunca le dijo a Pedro que estableciera la sede de su iglesia en Roma, ya que su sede era Jerusalen. Porqué la sede de la ICAR es Roma y no Jerusalen y porqué Pedro es el Papa y no Cristo? PORQUE LA ICAR NO ES LA IGLESIA DE JESUCRISTO. Es la iglesia de Pedro y de sus Papas. <br>  10- Muestreme el versículo en que Jesús dió el poder de la infalibilidad a Pedro.y la supremacía sobre los apóstoles. Eso es un invento de la ICAR. <br>  Mat 10:1 Jesús llamó a sus doce discípulos y les dio poder sobre los malos espíritus para expulsarlos y para curar toda clase de enfermedades y dolencias.Hay aquí algún rango especial para Pedro. NO.Lo dijo a todos por igual.<br>  11 - De modo que perdonar es lo mismo que remitir? y eso desde cuando?.miremos el versículo a ver si es lo mismo.<br>  <br>  Juan  20:23 a quienes perdonareis los pecados, les serán perdonados; a quienes se los retuviereis, les serán retenidos." Habla de perdonar y remitir. Lo entiendes o se lo explico. Tienes que usar la Hermeneutica. Este versículo se lo dejo tambien de tarea.<br>  12 - La transubstanciación (sabes eso  verdad?) Pues bien cuando Jesús bendijo el Pan cómo lo bendijo?. Al momento de bendecirlo se convirtió en su cuerpo y lo repartió a los apóstoles? Entonces qué pasó, Jesús desapareció porque se lo comieron en el pan? Jesús siguió vivo despues que comieron el pan? Si se comieron el cuerpo y la sangre de Jesús,cómo pudo ir a morir si su cuerpo se lo habían comido y bebido su sangre? Es lo más ilógico que la ICAR se ha inventado por no querer aceptar que es un SIMBOLO.<br>  <br>  13 -MATRIMONIO DE SACERDOTES: Es un mandato de la Biblia, porqué querer tapar el sol con un dedo? <br>  1Ti 3:2 pero es preciso que el obispo sea irreprensible, marido de una sola mujer, sobrio, prudente, morigerado, hospitalario, capaz de ense?ar;"<br>  <br>  Ti 3:5 pues quien no sabe gobernar su casa, ?cómo gobernará la Iglesia de Dios? Entonces quien tuerce las escrituras?<br>  <br>  14 - IDOLATRIA: Exo 20:4 No te harás imágenes talladas, ni figuración alguna de lo que hay en lo alto de los cielos, ni de lo que hay abajo en la tierra, ni de lo que hay en las aguas debajo de la tierra.<br>  Exo 20:5 No te postrarás ante ellas y no las servirás, porque yo soy Yahvé, tu Dios; un Dios celoso, que castiga en los hijos las iniquidades de los padres hasta la tercera y cuarta generación de los que me odian.<br>  No dices que la biblia no se debe interpretar? aplica este versículo tal y como está.<br>  Una cosa es que se hayan hecho figuras de querubines para adornar el arca y otra cosa es darles honra y veneración, como con la serpiente que despues de cumplido su propósito, el pueblo de Israel pretendió usar esa serpiente para venerarla y honrarla y por eso Dios mandó destruirla. Invocas a la virgen de Guadalupe con alguna virtud, será que ella tiene más virtud que su Hijo Jesucristo? porqué no lo mencionaste a él y sí a la virgen? será por la idolatría?.<br>  15 - Los protestantes nunca han dicho que Jesús ha dejado su iglesia, al contrario creen que Jesús es el mismo ayer, hoy y por los siglos y es la cabeza de ella, no así la ICAR que puso por cabeza a Pedro y los Papas en lugar de Cristo.<br>  16 - la salvacion:  Efesion 2:8  porque por gracia sois salvos por medio de la fe;  y esto no de vosotros,  pues es don de Dios<br>  Efesios 2:9  No por obras,  para que nadie se gloríe.<br>  Si la salvación es por obras, entonces  cual fue la salvación que nos dió Cristo?  Había podido decir: Hagan obras y se salvarán, así yo no tengo que morir.Sí,  hay que hacer obras, pero no para salvarnos sino en gratitud de que ya somos salvos.<br>  Espero que con esta explicación no vuelvas a METER LA PATA.

(II Pedro, III, 16). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes Cualquiera puede entender la Biblia, menos la Iglesia Católica. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or dijo a San Pedro: Tu eres Pedro Y Sobre esta Piedra edificaré mi Iglesia (Mat. XVI, 18) (Pedro - piedra). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Pedro no es la piedra sobre la que edificó Cristo su Iglesia. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or dijo a San Pedro: A ti te daré las llaves del Reino de los Cielos (Mat. XVI, 19). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Cristo no dio a Pedro las llaves del Reino de los cielos. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or Jesucristo encomendó a San Pedro el cuidado de su Iglesia diciéndole: apacienta mis corderos... Apacienta mis ovejas (Jn. XXI, 16-17). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Cristo no encomendó a Pedro el cuidado de su Iglesia. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que nuestro Se?or concedió a San Pedro el Don de la infalibilidad y la supremacía sobre los Apóstoles, encomendándole que les confirmara, diciéndole: Yo he orado por ti para que tu Fe no falte, y tú una vez vuelto confirma a tus hermanos (Luc. XXII, 32). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Cristo no concedió a Pedro el Don de la infalibilidad, Pedro no tiene ninguna supremacía sobre los demás Apóstoles. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante: "Y los nombres de los doce Apóstoles son éstos: el primero Simón, que es dicho Pedro" (Mat.. X). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Pedro NO ES el primero de los Apóstoles. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or dijo a sus Apóstoles: A los que remitierais sus pecados les son remitidos, a quienes los retuvierais les serán retenidos (Juan XX, 23.) (Remitir es lo mismo que perdonar). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes : Cristo no concedió a sus Apóstoles el poder de perdonar los pecados. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or, en la Ultima Cena que celebró con sus Apóstoles, tomando el pan en sus manos, dijo: ESTO ES MI CUERPO (Mal. XXVI, 26, Marc. XIV, 22, Luc. XXII, 19.). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Eso NO ES su Cuerpo. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or, después de haber cambiado el pan y el vino en su Cuerpo y en su Sangre, dio a sus Apóstoles la orden y el poder de hacer lo que él había hecho, diciéndoles: HACED ESTO EN MEMORIA MIA (Luc. XXII, 19), orden que los Sacerdotes católicos obedecen celebrando la Santa Misa. <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Cristo no dio a sus Apóstoles ni la orden, ni el poder, de hacer lo que él había hecho. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante. Que el Sacramento que llamamos ahora Extremaunción o Unción de los Enfermos, estaba en uso en la Iglesia Apostólica, en estos términos:"?Está enfermo alguno entre vosotros? Llamen a los presbíteros de la Iglesia y oren por él ungiéndole con óleo, en el nombre del Se?or y la oración nacida de la Fe, salvará al enfermo y el Se?or le aliviará y si se halla con pecado se lo perdonara" (Sant. V, 14,15). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: El sacramento de la Extremaunción es un invento de la Iglesia Católica.<br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que no conviene que los ministros de Dios se casen, en estos términos: bien le es al hombre no tocar mujer (I Cor. VII, l). "El soltero tiene cuidado de las cosas que son del Se?or, como ha de agradar al Se?or, pero el que se casó tiene cuidado de las cosas que son del mundo, como ha de agradar a su mujer" (1 Cor. VII, 32). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Los Ministros de Dios deben casarse. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Jehová no condena las Imágenes, pues dijo a Moisés. "Harás también dos querubines de oro" (Ex. XXV, 18), y "hazte una serpiente ardiente y ponla sobre la bandera; y será que cualquiera que fuere mordido y mirare a ella vivirá. Y Moisés hizo una serpiente de metal y púsola sobre la bandera: y fue que cuando alguna serpiente mordía a alguno, miraba la serpiente de metal y vivía" (Núm. XXI, 8-9). (Y la imagen de la Virgen de Guadalupe ?no podrá tener alguna virtud? <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: tener Imágenes es idolatría. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante que Nuestro Se?or dijo a sus Discípulos: He aquí yo estoy con vosotros todos los días hasta el fin del mundo(Mat. XXVIII, 20). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: Cristo no ha estado con su Iglesia pues ésta se había corrompido en el siglo XVI. <br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante: " Y si tuviera toda la Fe de tal manera que traspaso los montes y no tengo caridad, nada soy" (1 cor. XIII, 2). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes basta con la fe para salvaras. Dice la Biblia protestante: "El hombre es justificadopor las obras y no solamente por la fe" (Sant. II, 24). <br>  <br>  Dicen los protestantes: basta con la Fe para salvarse, No las obras.<br>  <br>  Dice la Biblia protestante en Mat.

OUSPENSKY<br>  Editorial Ghanesa. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Comentario de Cristóbal Cobo <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Este libro es el relato privilegiado que el más inteligente de sus discípulos –Piotr Demiánovich Ouspensky- realizó de las ense?anzas de Gurdjieff. Ouspensky era ya un escritor reconocido antes de su encuentro con Gurdjieff, con obras como "La cuarta dimensión" (interesante contribución a la teoría matemática), "Tertium Organum" o "Un nuevo modelo del universo", en las que había dejado constancia de su profundidad como pensador y su interés en los problemas de la existencia humana.<br>  <br>  Era pues Ouspensky un honesto y racional buscador de la Verdad. Había recorrido gran parte de Asia en busca de antiguas escuelas iniciáticas que hubieran sobrevivido al discurrir de Cronos, con poco éxito.<br>  <br>  Y he aquí que fue a su regreso a Rusia, en 1914 y recién estallada la I Guerra Mundial, cuando se encontró con un enigmático "profesor de baile", de nombre Gurdjieff, en quien reconoció un auténtico maestro espiritual. En efecto, Gurdjieff ense?aba un complejo sistema iniciático, conocido como el Cuarto Camino, que forma un todo coherente, y que incluye un profundo conocimiento de la psique humana, una cosmología inaudita pero sin fisuras, una serie de disciplinas mentales y físicas, un conjunto extraordinario de danzas sagradas rituales, además de decenas de partituras musicales. Un sistema, en fin, caracterizado por el rigor intelectual, el sufrimiento voluntario como única vía para despertar de la hipnosis en la que vivimos y una ausencia de moralina que es de agradecer. <br>  <br>  Es decir, lo contrario del pensamiento religioso al que estamos acostumbrados en Occidente, por no hablar de las vías de "buen rollito", palabrería vacua y cursillos de fin de semana que propone la New Age.<br>  <br>  En mi opinión, la obra más adecuada para quien se acerca por primera vez al pensamiento de quien ha sido considerado por unos un avatar espiritual, por otros simplemente un mago.<br>  Por Cristóbal Cobo.|`|bo5QTCEvaa	Con un rotomartillo de altas revoluciones en la sien.

Esta naturaleza interna, puesta por el nacimiento físico en un medio favorable para su desarrollo, es lo que modela la vida exterior, que se expresa por medio de pensamientos, palabras y acciones.  Lo primero que hay que comprender bien es que el Dharma no es una cosa exterior, como la ley, la virtud, la religión o la justicia; es a ley de la vida que se despliega y modela a su propia imágen todo lo que es exterior a ella.  A esta palabra, pues, se le han dado numerosos significados, tales como: ley, religión, justicia, deber, piedad, virtud, mérito, condición, atributo, cualidad o propiedad esencial; doctrina, credo; código, derecho; conocimiento, sabiduría; verdad; práctica, costumbre; bien; obra piadosa, etc.  –Dharma es también uno de los nombres de Yama, dios de la justicia.<br>  <br>  Te recomiendo que leas texto teosoficos, por ejemplo puedes empezar con algunos de Annie Bessant, la cual escribió precisamente un libro titulado "El Dharma", y después continuar con Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bye|`|qhty3UTyaa	deberás buscarte un maestro iniciado en la tradición, que pueda dar mínima cuenta de su "linaje"<br>  el unico q yo conozco es Kosen Tibaut, monje del budismo zen soto<br>  suerte!|`|kgd8TZ2naa	Practicando obras buenas, y tratando de ser bueno con el projimo.

mTqbVF5Zaa	I don't have an answer for you exactly, but do know that it can be done.  I have an aunt who used a ouija board safely for years.  She had a small number of spirits she'd talk with.  She did caution me that not all the spirits out there are good and that you have to be careful.  I seem to remember her telling me once that you have to ask them if they mean you harm.  If they say no, they're probably ok, but you still need to lay down ground rules by stating that you'd like to talk with them only through the board, inviting them in the beginning and saying so when it's time for them to leave.  As with any interactions, it's never appropriate to compel someone to your will.  That is, you should never tell them when to come to you / demand their presence.  You should instead invite them politely... "Are their any kind spirits here who would like to talk with me / us?  If so, we'd like to talk with you."  That sort of thing.  <br>  <br>  You should talk with someone who really is an expert prior to actually doing as opposed to someone like me who only remembers a little from childhood.  (I was young enough that my aunt didn't want me to worry about the dark side of it all.  She handled all the preliminaries before any of us kids were allowed into the room.)<br>  <br>  I can tell you that she let me and one of my cousins have a go after her usual spirit had gone.  When we asked the spirit it's name, it answered.  When we asked if it was kind, it bumped the table.  We were seriously spooked at that and, heeding our aunt's advice, shut it down and even left the room.<br>  <br>  Perhaps my answer will tell you some of what to look for and believe in the right answer when you hear it.  You need details though.  Exactly what questions to ask and what ground rules to set.<br>  <br>  Take care, have fun, but be safe.<br>  <br>  Blessed be.|`|ZArXrKJJaa	I'm not sure if i can fully answer your question, but my aunt is a clairvoyant and has been warned plenty of times by her mentor to stay clear of them. Only experienced people can use the Ouija board properly - with the knowledge to close the link- other wise any spirit could come through.<br>  Quite a thew of these attract evil spirits because the person/people using the board doesn't have much knowledge or control over the summoning.<br>  I'm not sure about how you can find out if the spirit you have contacted will turn dark, but i could always ask my aunt. I can assure you that she is the real deal ^^;<br>  I have a lot of history with spirits in my family and it's probably the reason i'm always so freaked out by this stuff.<br>  <br>  If you're really worried about this, see if you can find a medium or clairvoyant who can give you some advice. If they're the real deal you should be able to tell, most fake ones will ask you too many questions trying to see what they can get from you.<br>  There are ways of protecting yourself but i'm not sure on their details yet, i'm still learning my self.<br>  <br>  I hope every one who replies on here has a way to help you x<br>  Hope this helps too x<br>  <br>  Oh and DON'T burn the Ouija board ><;; that does noting but keep the link OPEN.|`|abc845b4d5c10a574c52a8870c89c6e2aa	The thing about ouija boards is that you can't protect yourself with what comes through. It is a portal of sorts, and with no boundaries. I Have had one, and used it a few times, before I thought it best it be put away. You could end up with spirits lingering in your home, or much darker things. Ouija boards are always fun, but risky|`|LfNRJ1sIaa	Here's an idea, don't play with a Ouija board.

And see how most of them would still try to go over the fence thinking maybe there is a much better tasting grass on the other side. That is the reason why oftentimes people are swayed to join another group. Specially if the new or just the other group will have something much humanly easier to believe or to cater to their likings which many thought of being more divine or enlightening. Just take cautions, all that sounds divine or enlightening are like sweet sugar; some sweet thing may lead to death.<br>  Freedom of choice? Yes.

But their are a lot of people who like to do wicked and evil things to.|`|39rXZUeQaa	Every human possesses the ability to use both. There are different theories of human nature. One is that people are naturally self-interested, and that in the state of nature things are savage, wild, and people's lives are short. People in this state have no obligation to their fellow men. Without law, it is argued, their only goal is to maximize their own benefits, at whatever cost. No real value is placed on human life. Lives in this state are violent and swift. At least that's what Hobbes said.<br>  <br>  I don't entirely agree with this view. The other side of humans is true too. People have an inherent sense of fairness, and obligation to help their fellow men. Some people are born without this, but they are sociopaths and there aren't too many of them. <br>  <br>  I think most people are basically good, and really do have good intentions, even if some of these can be minimized by a person's own self-interest. But truly evil people are just as rare as true love. Many believe that there are only evil acts, and that no man is evil in and of himself. I don't know what I think about this. People aren't naturally anything. <br>  <br>  However, this inherent sense of fairness in humans doesn't always prevail. I think very few people are naturally evil. But if an inherently good person's thinking is twisted enough, and their judgment clouded, they can commit acts of evil without grasping the enormity of what they are doing. It is possible, with the right techniques, to stomp out the human core of man. It is possible to dehumanize him to the point where he has a complete disregard for human life. But this is uncommon. And although we'd all like to believe that man will one day rise above all fears and create a world of justice and peace, it isn't likely so. There will always be evil acts. But most people are good, or start out good.|`|JXH9vbs8aa	I think some people are naturally good, and some people are naturally evil... <br>  <br>  I really don't have a positive outlook on society as a whole, as much as i'd like to =\|`|5cCIDpGfaa	WOW, It's history class all over again.<br>  Jean-Jacques Rousseau thought people were naturally good and society corrupted them.

Furthermore, what was "evil" at one time will not be the same as what is "evil" today. In other words, the terms are relative and there's no objective standard of what's good and what's evil. Therefore I think no one is "naturally" either one or the other but come to be considered one or the other by the social groups they are a part of as they age. Neither does it seem likely that more than a few people could ever be reasonably considered totally "evil" and probably none at all totally "good". <br>  |`|IUfAt6C3aa	i think people are born good.  then they exercise their free will and begin making choices.  things like nurturing, environment, and chemical inconsistencies come into play, and people can make bad, sometimes evil, choices.  <br>  <br>  humans are different from animals because we are able to use reason and logic and determine the consequences of our choices. <br>  <br>  but i believe all people start out good.|`|bYXz6xJcaa	I've always thought people are naturally good for the most part.

Un virus ne va pas d'une famille à une autre.<br>  Sauf en cas de mutation.<br>  <br>  Les vaches mangent des végétaux. Cela va définir la nature de leur viande. Les carnivores sont s?rs d'être en bonne santé s'ils mangent des herbivores.<br>  Mais s'ils mangent eux-mêmes des carnivores, ils favorisent le transfert et la mutation des maladies.<br>  <br>  Dans la nature, les lions ne mangent pas d'autres carnivores.<br>  <br>  Mais il existe des animaux comme le porc ou le singe qui sont homnivores.<br>  A la différence des poissons, le fait qu'ils mangent de la viande rend leur viande impropre à la consommation. En effet, le porc est comme une passerelle à maladie.<br>  <br>  Si vous mangez une poule qui a la grippe aviaire, normalement, vous n'êtes pas contaminé.<br>  Mais si vous mangez du cochon malade, il y a de grandes chances que le virus subisse une mutation chez cet animal de transition et que vous soyez contaminés.<br>  <br>  ---------------...<br>  Le Coran interdit de manger des "animaux qui ont les 2 machoires complètement pleines de dents".<br>  Un biologiste vous dira que c'est une description des carnivores.<br>  Le porc est une exception. Il n'a pas les machoires pleines de dents mais il mange de la bidoche !<br>  C'est pourquoi il est nommé si précisément.|`|7NJbjX5Aaa	Je ne sais pas mais c'est triste car c'est trop BON|`|83b822600beccd5e1df3abf939e085bcaa	les chrétiens mangent de la viande le vendredi.<br>  <br>  Si je voudrait faire de la provoc' je dirais qu'ils ne sont pas cannibales, mais je crois que ?a remonte à une légende ancienne, dont je ne me rappelle plus vraiment.|`|BTinz2wAaa	au début parceque le Coran l'a interdit il y a I4OO ans, parce que c'est une viande qui ne peut supporter la chaleur, et être comme le boeuf ou le mouton séchée.<br>  De nos jours parceque leur parents les en ont dégoutés .... mais de plus en plus les musulmans modernes et instruits savent que ce n'est pas parcequ'ils mangent du porc que Dieu va les punir et ils le consomment sans probléme...  Tu sais nous sommes plus lents que vous à nous adapter au modernisme, et notre culture fait que nous devons souvent ne pas faire certaines choses pour préserver nos parents et leurs croyances... et manger ou non du porc ce n'est pas important !|`|GsRVRdlPaa	Parce que c'est prohibé. Une légende soutient que c'est parce qu'un porc a rendu service au Prophet Mohammed( paix et salut sur lui) qu'il a interdit la cosommation de sa chair à tout croyant musulman. C'est comme le totem en Afrique! Tout animal qui a rendu service à un ancêtre devient l'ami de toute la descendance de cet ancêtre. Et on ne fait pas du mal à un ami!|`|db6e0840afa149ff7b8c34a30b9ba094aa	C'est une viande qui mal cuite est a risque.<br>  Entre autre le ténia !<br>  Un principe de précaution.|`|iNx2YQWqaa	quand ils n'auront plus que ca a  bouffer, ils ferons moins les difficiles........LOL..!!!|`|jKxQzJqkaa	Il n'y a pas que les musulmans qui ne consomment pas de porc!<br>  <br>  une réponse pour le con!|`|87675fa2b2a2315dcfca7614f949b7f4aa	En fait, non seulement le Coran interdit la consommation de porc mais la Bible aussi l'interdit. Dans le Lévitique, chapitre 11, verset 7-8, .....il est dit : <br>  <br>  "Vous ne mangerez pas le porc, ...Vous ne mangerez pas de leur chair, et vous ne toucherez pas leurs corps morts : vous les regarderez comme impurs". <br>  <br>  De plus, saviez-vous que le porc ne peut pas être égorgé tout simplement parce qu'il n'a pas de cou ?.....Cela est une caractéristique physique naturelle du porc, de ne pas avoir de cou. <br>  <br>  La consommation de porc est mauvaise pour la santé, quelque soit le produit : c?tes de porc, jambon, bacon, etc.<br>  <br>  L'acide urique est une substance dangereuse pour le corps humain. <br>  <br>  Eh bien il est important de noter que le corps du cochon ne se débarrasse que de 2% de son acide urique, les 98% restants ne sortant pas du corps. <br>  <br>  Ceci explique le haut pourcentage de rhumatismes trouvé chez ceux qui consomment du porc.<br>  Tout ce qu'un porc ingurgite devient graisse dans environ six heures. Pour la vache, cela nécessite vingt-quatre heures ou plus. Le cochon (porc chatré ou castré) possède des vaisseaux situés au-dessus de leurs sabots et spécialement con?us pour la suppuration et régulariser l'évacuation des poisons de son corps. Le cochon transporte certains virus et certaines maladies, y compris des trichines (vers parasites), lesquelles, si elles sont ingérées par les humains, peuvent causer une maladie douloureuse et parfois fatale, connue sous le nom de trichinose. De plus, la chair de porc contient un taux de cholestérol tellement élevé, que c'est l'une des choses que le médecin demande à ses patients qui ont une maladie coronarienne, d'éviter dans leur alimentation.|`|EGS0hnb0aa	les musulmans ne mangent pas de porc parce que tout simplement le coran l'interdit de meme pour les juifs la torah l'interdit|`|HgQiJGa3aa	Les Musulmans ne mangent pas de porc... en effet !<br>  <br>  Les loups ne se mangent pas entre eux !!!|`|Rz0BvqCZaa	Excusées ns,mais ns Musulmans, ns mangions que du bon   et  pa de la merde!!!|`|TmFcgm46aa	car le cochon mange de tout omnivore donc il mange n'importe quoi c'est pour cela que les musulmans n'en mangent pas.|`|lvXpe1fwaa	le cochon c'est de la cochonnerie comme toi et c'est justement pour ?a que les musulmans le bannissent...t'as pigé petit con et cochon qui s' nettoie dans de la merde ?|`|117828ec8d9cb1e66ea09f2f756f211baa	Merci à Rose pour nous offrir l'occasion de rigoler...<br>  <br>  - Le Coran insiste sur le fait que le Cochon n'est pas impur, il est simplement interdit de consommer sa chair.<br>  <br>  - La Bible est un recueil en deux parties : l'ancien testament, dans lequel on interdit la consommation de porc, cette partie est la seule considérée par les Juifs. Dans le nouveau testament, il n'est pas fait état de telles choses, et c'est ce second livre qui est le support de la foi chrétienne. D'ailleurs, dans la foi chrétienne, il est des jours gras, et des jours maigres (en général 3 à 4 par semaine) dans lesquels il est interdit de consommer des subtstances animales et en particulier de la viande... Ca va un peu plus loin...!<br>  <br>  Il faut donc éviter les amalgames.<br>  <br>  Quand à ceux qui affirment que la consommation de la viande de porc peut provoquer des maladies, ils ont en partie raison, sauf que toutes les viandes, animales ou de poisson peuvent provoquer des maladies, elles contiennent toutes des substances toxiques et des parasites. Et il en est de même pour les végétaux. C'est la raison pour laquelle l'homme a inventé la cuisine : une manière de rendre les aliments sains et conservables. Dans le monde moderne, la cuisine est synonyme de plaisir alors qu'en fait c'est une nécessité !<br>  <br>  Manger du poisson cru ou mal cuit peu conduire à une infestation de vers, non pas dans le tube digestif, mais dans toute la chair, et cela n'est pas dans les écritures pourtant (à ma connaissance).<br>  <br>  Au niveau de la "propreté" du cochon, et bien ceux qui disent  du mal devraient un peu aller en voir de près... Les cochons élevés à l'extérieur sont bien plus propres que les vaches ou les chèvres et même les moutons ! Tous les animaux mangent des choses qui nous paraissent "sales"... qu'est-ce que vous croyez ?<br>  <br>  Le problème c'est que l'on ne peut pas vivre sans consommer de substances d'origine animales (viandes, oeufs...). Il faut donc en consommer. Et comme tout, il faut en consommer avec modération. <br>  <br>  Libres sont ceux qui on choisi cette voie, de ne pas manger de cochon, il n'y a rien de mal à ?a !|`|Yjv7Rm2Laa	Une à la con : t'occupes ! ?a nous en fait plus pour nous !|`|yrKxeFKLaa	Parce qu'a l'époque du prophéte les gens etaient atteints de maladies comme le "ténia" qui est transmi à l'homme par la viande de porc !

AA11644082	Yes, and I think mainly because there are a great number of immigrants who have come to the US illegally, more than the number of immigrants who came legally in the early 1900s.

They need to return to Mexico.  When the european immigrants came to this country has no comparison to what's happening with the mexicans.  They didn't come here illegally, expect everyone else to learn their language and not attempt to learn ours.  Expect free health care, welfare and any other thing they could get for free.  They didn't start gangs, terrorize cities, graffiti buildings. walls, train cars and anything else they can get their hands on.  So, is there a difference... yeah, about a 500% difference.....  Their illegal and our goverment and the people of this country need to send them back to mexico.....   I am tried of seeing mexican flags flying in front yards, and hearing Viva la Mexico.....  You want to Viva la mexico, then go there and live.....

Aún si existió y murió cricificado, el significado de su muerte, creo, es en realidad disintinta al que se cree.<br>  Para mí, es mas bien una muerte, un sacrificio, por un ideal, o por sus propios actos, nada más. Esto, porque hay que tomar en cuenta que, su muerte, como rescate (o para salvación de la humanidad) por el pecado de la primera pareja humana, no lo creo posible, primero porque la idea de sacrificio proviene de épocas anteriores, donde por medio del sacrificio se creia obtener el perdón y el favor de los dioses.  Luego, porque el hombre no fue creado, ha evolucionado a lo largo de millones de a?os, por lo que las palabras atribuidas a Pablo (por medio de un solo hombre el pecado vino al mundo y Cristo vino a librarnos de ello) no puede ser cierto.|`|3AQzksNYaa	pues realmente la religion sirve para tener  alas masas controladas y a sus instintos a raya por el temor del castigo divino pero bueno como no existio chucho no le veo beneficio mas alla de lo que te mencione|`|5URcUtm2aa	Ninguno.<br>  Para mi su muerte carece de valor espirtual y no puede salvar a nadie del pecado,lo que si puede salvar son su vida y sus ense?anzas (las cuales muy poca gente ha sabido observar detalladamente).<br>  Eso de que Dios nos ha castigado a todos por el pecado de Adan y Eva y de que solo podemos salvarnos de la muerte que merecemos si aceptamos la redencion de cristo me parece una leyenda infantil,puro cuento fantasioso.La muerte de un inocente jamas ha traido salvacion,sino mas bien todo lo contrario:destruccion.|`|MOSONJrHaa	Ninguna, para la humanidad fue una fuente de inspiracion para seguir su doctrina en base al amor al projimo que profesaba.|`|Zktscdpzaa	su nacimiento, su vida sus obras, su pasion ymuerte y sobre todo su resurrección, es el AMOR TOTAL.|`|dNmhWtenaa	hola amiga paara mi fue un rayo de luz para todo el mundo<br>  en la cual yo me encuentro entre ellos..<br>  asi es un gran beneficios para librarce de carga y estar libre<br>  de toda maldad...<br>  saludos amiga y cuidate|`|dYW0cxgsaa	Simple y sencillamente que gracias a dicho sacrificio estoy con vida y se me promete vida eterna si hago lo correcto y si doy prioridad a las cosas espirituales.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Juan 3:10|`|qqPM1HC5aa	La muerte de Cristo tiene significados  tan fuera del alcance de nuestra razón, y el beneficio para la humanidad es que él fue la propiciación o el pago por nuestros pecados y ahora por la fe en ese sacrificio podemos ser salvos de la paga del pecado que es muerte y cuando partimos de este mundo tenemos acceso al cielo que él ganó por nosotros........

Hitler was a cunning man and he indoctrinated the younger generation when he came to power which is why many of them thought and acted the way they did I have been to germany and it is really nice the people are polite and they are not racist I am black and I didn't feel uncomfortable while i was there. I even made two friends while I was there.<br>  Hitler wasn't German he was Austrian.|`|vszOEaOZaa	i would be able to justify someone hating germans if both people were around during that time.  otherwise, it's stereotyping.  it's like blacks hating whites because of slavery.  it was so long ago no one is still around now that was then.  so basically it's a grudge against someone that wasn't involved.|`|PLDRCAWlaa	im half german and half african nd i don't give a crap lol|`|1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	Yes, especially now. It's wrong to hate an entire group for the actions of just some of them. I would think that most of the Germans from the WWII era are deceased by now.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	It's pretty pointless because most of the ones who lived when Hitler was around will be dead now.  I was born at the end of the war and I am 63.|`|AA12018110	It's alright to hate Hitler I suppose, it was his fault. Germans today however had nothing to do with WW2, they've never done anything to you. |`|c6081a0488969b2a3c00ef2997b6bf43aa	no i find germans very friendly don't tar them all bad because of one crazy austrian who went by the name of hitler|`|WR4cYLd4aa	Of course it's wrong! That's like hating white people because we kicked the Native Americans off our land (which was a bad move... we look like jerks).<br>  |`|GU5R7AhMaa	no way thats the past n hope germans feel the same way.|`|dHymQMe0aa	You know, almost all if not all of those Germans are long dead. We don't hate people for what their ancestors did. I'm not responsible for slavery in the US, so for an African American to hate me would be ridiculous and wrong, and the if you look back at history, every group has been oppressed by another group at one time or another, but it's 2008, time to grow up and live in the present, NOT the past.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	Yes it is. Most of the Germans alive now had nothing to do with it.|`|AA12043226	Well first of there is something questionable as to you asking this question in the first place .because you are half jewish, should i hate you as to what went on during the war.and as this is in the past .would you not want to put this Absolute questionable war and what happened then to the past and leave it there. there are a great many wonderful thing in this place we call home ( meaning the wonderful planet that we live on ) and would you not want the best for yourself and others , to make it a better place for everyone . |`|aN4Xsmtuaa	people shouldn't hate germans - it happened a long time<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. I'm half german|`|WIEPISyeaa	No, I think the only person you can really despise is Hitler and the people who truly enjoyed torturing and killing the Jews.  To hate Germans now for what their parents/grandparents did isn't right.  That's like African Americans still hating whites because of what they did to their grandparents.  (Some do I guess, but they shouldn't, because it wasn't OUR fault our great great grandparents were retards.)|`|2jtRxKOsaa	don't h8 germans, 1 of my best m8s is half german|`|MYjAhq4Paa	Yes, it's wrong.  |`|dEdD8g0Qaa	i dont hate germans either. and yes that would be wrong... very few germans that had an active part in that war are actually still alive, so 99.9% of the germans alive today, would have had nothing to do with the war. even the ones that experienced it, were to young to exert any influence on the outcome.|`|1iHfOeNiaa	ya its wrong<br>  its not their fault for what hitler did|`|klBLBbV3aa	Can't blame their victims, and I don't buy the 'Good Germans, Bad Hitler' theme. They voted him in, loved him, and now feel guilty about loving him. Best thing about Germans? Many are dead.

Those who lost  relations and friends in the fighting or the blitz  might well dislike Germans,    Later generations  do not have these memories   so   probably more readily accept   them   All quite understandable really   |`|XGWFyi3Haa	Yes because most germans these days never even saw world war 2 because they werent born,that like people still hating the british for taking over half the world 400 years before we were even born.Its a bit rediculous,really.|`|7pq4F2Zjaa	My Great grand Father is German American and my Great grand Mother is African American and no I do not hate them but I do hate what they did.<br>  <br>  I'm a ww2 fanatic.|`|FJcatYc8aa	I don't hate Germans, it wasn't their fault a little man called hitler from their country wanted everyone dead.|`|fc6c9ab9b0b38258b3236327d25bd0f3aa	Yes, it is wrong to hate the German people now..but when you watch films like Schindler's List and documentaries on Auswich and all the other death camps, also, when you think about how many people died due to Germany starting TWO world wars... it's kind of hard not to at least dislike them ! I'm being honest and not politically correct .<br>  <br>  I find Germans kind of cold and arrogant so I dislike some of them for that reason more than for WW2  but at the end of the day the answer to your question is  yes, it is wrong to hate the Germans because it was hatred that made them exterminate millions of innocent people and I do not want to hate anyone, it would make me just as bad .<br>  Interesting question by the way :) |`|AA11527539	It is wrong to hate anyone for the actions of their parents.|`|f6Qad0usaa	I'd say the Germans paid up beyond their balance due.<br>  <br>  The atrocities committed against German civilians rivaled anything done to the Jews in the aftermath of world war II.  Unspeakable what happened to them as well as the Jews.  Why is this not discussed like the plight of the Jews?  Is atrocity not atrocity no matter who is doing it?<br>  <br>  Start with Dresden and then look for others.  200,000 civilians killed in one day and there is no rememberence of them...why?<br>  <br>  The starvation under the Morganthsu plan.....the barbarity of the Russians and Czechs toward ethnic Germans is truly horrifying.  Communists love sexual torture the world over. |`|9jI3zfgZaa	Doesn't matter where you are from, it is wrong to hate them|`|AA12069082	HI<br>  certainly , never give them a second chance at becoming a world force , i do believe that a lot more people knew what was going on at the terrible concentration camps ,  rather than denying it altogether.<br>  <br>  Never trust them at saving u a deck chair  at pool or beach , no chance .<br>  <br>  No i dont hate the german nation , but we can not forget the past, can we .We must learn from History .<br>   On a football note who can forget FIVE BLOODY ONE  to England .<br>  <br>  CYA |`|ildDmicCaa	Yes it is wrong, use your brain. You could have easily been born in Germany or at some point migrated there for whatever reason. It's prejudice.

They are no good at war ( they keep losing) but the football, now there's a sore point.|`|AA12292751	Yes, because not all Germans supported the war and the Nazi movement.|`|SYhdxWWgaa	Indians don't hate the british just 'coz they ruled (and ruined) them for 300+ years... they or anyone else should hate Germans..|`|u796ZduHaa	i dont think its right to hate them, its not there fault but i dont trust them...|`|i5vP02qwaa	it depends on how u see it. Some people hate germans but not all people do because they believe that it was really Hitlers fault|`|aIakDSstaa	Yes its pretty stupid, My Grandparents were only teenagers, so what effect does it have on me. Most Germans didn't have much choice to go to war either anyway. I think they've had it hanging over them for to long now, anyone that still thinks that way is faintly ridiculous in my eyes.<br>  <br>  Now if you were talking Football thats a different matter....Only kidding|`|AA11015890	I think it's understandable that some people many feel animosity towards the Germans as a race.  It's just important to remember that it was only a small number of Germans who committed the atrocities, not the race as a whole.  I would only have a problem with Germans who supported the actions of Hitler and his army.  That would be wrong.

8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	There is a difference in my opinion. This stems from the difference between reincarnation and rebirth.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of confusion surrounding the concepts of Reincarnation and Rebirth. At first glance it seems like they are synonyms, but there is a big difference between these two concepts.<br>  <br>  The doctrine of reincarnation, also referred to as transmigration, is taught by Hinduism, Jainism and Gnostic Christianity. It's main postulate is that there is an indestructible, eternal, personal element that travels from one life to the next. This element is called atman in the Hindu religion, jiva in the Jain faith and soul by Gnostic Christianity. Reincarnation assumes identity between the occupant of this body and, when this body dies, the occupant of the following body.<br>  <br>  In contrast, Buddhism teaches the doctrine of rebirth. Between a series of lifetimes there is a relationship of causality, not of identity. To make this more clear, let's use the example of the falling dominos. If I place a series of dominos standing up in line next to each other, and I strike the first one to make it fall down, this causes the second one to fall down, and the next, until the last in line falls down. The fall of the first domino is the cause of the fall of the last one, but there is not a shared identity between the first and the last domino.<br>  <br>  When somebody dies, rebirth is caused by the continuation of the mental processes of the dead person in a new body. The new person however is not identical to the one that left the previous body (a lot of causes and conditions come into play to shape this new being), nor a completely different person (because of causality relation).<br>  <br>  So this shows the difference between Nirvana and Moksha. In Nirvarana the is a realisation that there is no 'I', thus a cesation of being or idividuality. While Moksha is a reunification with God (Brahman), so is more like a cube of sugar being disolved in water.<br>  <br>  The 'I'-ness (or false ego) is lost in both cases but in different ways. <br>  <br>  _()_|`|FCzOjs7Jaa	They are both terms used in Hinduism and Buddhism.  Moksha means you've broken the cycle of reincarnation in Hinduism, rebirth in Buddhism, and once this is achieved, may enter the state of Nirvana, where one realizes his or her true nature and remains there.  The only difference lies in reincarnation, where one has a personal, individual soul (duelism) in Hinduism, and rebirth, where there is nonsoul or nonself, where there is only one soul of which we all are, in Buddhism.|`|2887544a9688b33e1ebb1a4e3397d4e9aa	Siva, excellently explained! - the difference between rebirth and reincarnation.<br>  <br>  Warrior poo flinger - your  "one soul" idea, like the idea of a universal mind, has never found acceptance in Buddhism as far as I know.

The only reason anyone is in hell, is because they are not in a relationship with God via Jesus Christ. amen.  all people in heaven are ex sinning believers. All people in hell are ex sinning non believers.  all in heaven have an active belief in God. all people in hell do not.  your relationship with Jesus Christ keeps you with himself/God - which is heaven and vice versa.  The only hell to pay is the fact that you are obviously mean, ugly, stupid and disrespectful...that is your chosen hell, you will get the consequence no matter what you believe, mostly you should be  feeling pretty dumb|`|Xtqq71KGaa	no, but he is.    not really, there is no hell.|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	I wouldn't think you would go to hell for that but you should reconsider your actions in the future.

So I wouldn't worry about it. |`|BUxHYAbiaa	No need to worry because there is no hell to go to in the first place. Because when you die, you are conscious of nothing. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.|`|wrQ1F5G0aa	if you are save you are not.  thats just a mean and disrespectful joke.|`|kiwB8eTCaa	Only you know if your going to hell or not.|`|Ly4BARegaa	And when he grabbed the hand soap in the bathroom, he smelled it and said "Grannie!"|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Only if god is the pettiest deity imaginable.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	You're not going to hell but you are definitely an orifice.|`|zMcHYQeBaa	no, you are not going to hell

3b8f805c7988647b5a9ca864a23d2a7aaa	The idea of having a universal language, especially if it is arbitrarily chosen or worse, forced (and English would be just one of many bad choices) would be next to useless. There isn't a national language out there that would permit most people to learn it like a native. The deadlock over which language would get ugly indeed.<br>  However, an AUXILIARY language, intended to bridge the gap between cultures by providing an easily learnt method of communication would be the answer. It would open the EU and indeed, the world up to far more in the way of understanding.<br>  Esperanto is making headway in becoming an AUXILIARY language, yet people reject it out of hand because they all fear the loss of their tongue and a single language spoken by all, which of course is exactly what Esperanto is trying NOT to do.<br>  As a common SECOND language you and you and you have no need to sink years into study of a language that you will most likely NEVER fully assimilate like a native. The choice would be yours. With Esperanto you can be comfortable talking to your neighbour in your native tongue and just as comfortable talking to Ming Lu across the waves on an equal footing in this easily learnt language. It's like a neutral handshake, because each participant invested an equal amount of effort to learn this easy language. (16 gramatical rules... NO exceptions!)<br>  Believe it or not, Esperanto represents the best chance for the survival of the multitude of dying languages since it's purpose is to forestall the monopoly of any one National tongue to the disadvantage of another.<br>  So will it some day become universal (which by the way doesn't mean that EVERYBODY in the world speaks it, just those that want it / need it)?<br>  Well, the $600 million+ USD spent yearly on translation services at the UN (six official languages) and a similar amount in the EU says, sooner or later something is going to change, and this is the cheapest and most effective, proven alternative.<br>  <br>  Further, if you don't think Esperanto is making headway, check this.<br>  In a recent reprint of the Unua Libro (first book), editor Gene Keyes said that when he first started the project in 2000, he did a search for Esperanto on Google and it yielded over 1 million hits. At the completion of his task in February of 2007, the same search yielded over 34 million hits. Out of curiosity, after I had read that I did the same search and it yielded over 39.2 million hits. That's up over 5 million in two months. So it's growing. Slowly (or maybe not so slowly!)<br>  Obviously not everyone will find a use for it, and that's fine. However for those that take the time and bother to search out the other users, it's worth it. Of course searching out other uses gets easier with each passing day.<br>  Personally I have friends all over the world. Friends I wouldn't have had with out Esperanto.<br>  <br>  Some have the opinion that the language is Impractical and awkward.<br>  The two million plus (as of 1995) people that use it says it's not Impractical. Two million was considered the functionally fluent level (IE: able to get by in the necessary elements when travelling) in 1995. Since 1995 the Internet has grown by leaps and bounds, and Esperanto right along with it.<br>  As for awkward, well I don't agree, but then anything that you start might be considered awkward until you get the practice in that you need.<br>  Wikipedia hosts more than 250 different languages. Esperanto ranks 22nd in the most numerous articles category.<br>  More than these languages to name a few.<br>  <br>  <br>  23 Slovak<br>  24 Danish<br>  25 Indonesian<br>  <br>  <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_W...</a><br>  <br>  NOBODY has to give up their mother tongue, nor should they.<br>  Esperanto as an auxiliary language however would be wonderful.<br>  <br>  I encourage everybody to research and draw their own conclusions.<br>  <br>  ?is!|`|l2qtG4yfaa	Who decides what is easy though? To English speakers an "easy" language would be different than what a Mandarin speaker might consider it because we use different sounds and symbols.|`|MR1wm6deaa	well, english chinese and spanish are all very quickly spreading languages. americans are the few who arent taught to speak a 2nd language well (many europeans tend to know about 3 languages, taught since grammar school). english is a pretty standard universal language many people speak, but not necessarily an easy one as it has many exceptions. perhaps with our global community where ideas are spread much faster eventually a common language might evolve in several thousand years...|`|JYDIYVozaa	There had been one attempt to do such and that is the creation of the Esperanto language.  The idea at the back of it was having a language that is easily learned by any one in this planet.  It turned out to be quite a fluke, though.

9v3LmoTaaa	You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and you are using it. That in itself will take you farther in life than worrying about what other people think, or tolerating activities that you don't think are worthwhile.<br>  I disagree with "try to fit it and use them as long as you can"<br>  That philosophy will only backfire on you. The truth comes out sooner or later and people will not ever trust you if you let it show that you never really care for them anyway. Trying to fit in and using people is shallow. It takes a much stronger person to be true to themselves, and their own personal values.<br>  Don't let the influence of others determine your course of action.<br>  No one else can decide what is right and perfect for you. Stand up for what you believe in, and be supportive of other decent people. But don't worry about the jokers that don't have anything better to do than be phony and mock others. Their lives are going nowhere.<br>  The only person you have to worry about satisfying is the girl that looks back at you in the mirror. If you're honest with yourself first, you'll have fewer regrets later, even in school. You'll find plenty of other people that you have more in common with. Most people get their attention from negative behaviors & it's your choice to not conduct yourself that way! Be true to you ~ and your beauty will shine through in all you do, all the days of your life. Girl Power! The people you described sound stupid to me.|`|sSmijPSDaa	They're probably all good friends and just happen to be obnoxious. That does not mean they're popular. You can have close friends, enjoy their company and everything but that does not make you popular or well known.  That just means you have a good set of friends.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you need to start hanging with some new friends. People you trust and those who can give you a good laugh. <br>  <br>  You don't need to be an Abercrombie Zombie to have lots of friends or be considered "popular." Lots of people might know how dumb and pathetic you are but that's not really popular in a positive way.|`|rcs9qPX9aa	If you're in 5th grade, you're too young to be on here according to the rules.  But I'll try and answer your question.  Those girls, acting like jerks, talking loud, feeding off each other, do that so they feel accepted and it gives them a sense of belonging and in a way POWER.   The only way the popular crowd remains the popular crowd is to get others to either act the way they act or by making others feel left out.  If you want people to like you, always be clean, confident, kind, polite, and look around for people that behave like you do.  It's strange, but usually a group of about 6 or 7 loud, selfish, jerky, rude people can form a group and somehow make all the others feel inferior. You other guys are the majority.  Form your own group, don't exclude anyone.  30 or 40 kids who accept each other, don't watch the popular kids foolishness, and just watch out for one another can have a lot of impact.  They have power that they never dreamed.  The reason they act jerky and selfish, like they've got some secret popularity, is to have power over the others.  Ignore them, go confidently past with your group of friends, and do your own thing....play basketball, get up a soccer game, enjoy being a kid.  Don't be mean, or try to make them feel isolated, just accept that they are probably just as insecure as everyone else is at 11.  They aren't the fashion police, or the trend setters. They'll probably get worse before they get better.    Go through your life confidently, cause you and your friends are just happy being you.  Smile, you're pretty special to see through their shallowness.  :)|`|26khrXAFaa	They are popular because they are noticable in a dumb way! You're in 5th grade? You're a smart 5th grader. I gotta give you credit. You have realized that material things, and being popular by being silly is not the best way to get noticed. There will always be people who don't like you. You have to accept that. But, you sound like a real smart, and bright person. People will like you. Just be yourself. Don't try to act like these girls to get noticed. Don't be anyone but who YOU ARE. Be yourself, be friendly, and you will see people will open up more to you, and you don't have to be like these girls to be popular.|`|7pcjoED4aa	Trust me sweet cheeks, one day you will be at your job or college, and you won't remember ANY of this.

You have other plans!

They are used mostly as investigative (bullying) tools, not as evidence.<br>  <br>  They can also come out 'inconclusive', even if someone is 100% innocent, leading investigators to assume you must be guilty and therefore STOP looking for the real perpetrators.

Catholics believe that the Eucharist is the living, risen Jesus. It is the same Jesus who appeared to the Apostles (when Thomas was not there). In the words of St. John Vianney, "It's really Him!"<br>  <br>  Catholics also believe in the veneration of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Mary is our most powerful intercessor. Do not people ask their living friends and relatives to pray for them? How much more powerful, then, is the intercession of God's own Mother, who loved Him perfectly during her life on earth, and to whom He remains obedient in heaven. Mary can pray to God more effectively than you or I ever could.<br>  <br>  The Holy Rosary is an extremely powerful prayer when prayed from the heart, when each Hail Mary is prayed with love and childlike simplicity. (Many will testify to this--St. John Vianney, St. Padre Pio, Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta, etc.)<br>  <br>  If a king invites you to have dinner with him, this is a great honor. However, if he calls a gathering of the entire kingdom, and proclaims your greatness in front of them so that they may praise and honor you too, this is an even higher honor. In the same way, Jesus, our King, wishes to honor His mother by making her loved and venerated by all. Jesus was so grateful to the woman who poured an expensive ointment over His Head that He proclaimed "In truth I tell you, wherever in all the world this gospel is proclaimed, what she has done will be told as well, in remembrance of her." (Matthew 26:13) If such is His gratitude for this woman's one act of kindness, imagine then, His gratitude for His mother's entire lifetime of love (Mary's "yes" to God ("Be it done to me according to thy word") despite what it would cost her, her pregnancy at a time when she was not yet married and thus her humiliation before St. Joseph and her acquaintances, her nursing of the Son of God, the way she lovingly held and caressed the Divine Child, the clothes she knitted for Him, the meals she prepared for Him, all that she suffered upon seeing her innocent Son so brutally tortured and murdered, etc.)<br>  <br>  God is infinitely happy. He has no need of human praise, so He lets Mary be our Vessel of Devotion.<br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.<br>  <br>  St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.<br>  <br>  St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary.

But for the sake f argument I will take on this task. <br>  <br>  It depends on the beliefs of the Born Again Christian, if they believe that once they are "saved" then they are saved for life I ask them to refer to the bible and look at when Jesus told his Apostles that what ever sins they forgive he will forgive in heaven an that with sin still in our hearts wee cannot enter heaven since heaven is a perfectly pure place.<br>  <br>  If they believe "faith alone" saves us then Again I refer them to the bible where it clearly states that it is no by our faith alone that we are saved. <br>  <br>  Then there are a hundreds of other things that make them different. A good place to start is an RCIA class at your local Catholic church. RCIA is for anyone interested in learning more about the Church and what it believes. It is also something that converts go through to make sure they understand what they are getting into before getting into it.<br>  <br>  If you really want more answers to this type of question then go there. If you aren't ready to venture off the net to get answers try catholic.org it has a forum that can be very helpful.|`|WhsNMH5maa	A Catholic believes that the bread and wine in Communion are TRULY the body and blood, soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is NOT a symbol. A born again christian has a different view of being born again than a Catholic does. For a Catholic, it means baptism. For a BAC, it means something else, Im not exactly sure what. You can look in the Bible. There is a scripture passage about baptism.|`|axT0Gl0haa	Catholics are not Christians. <br>  <br>  Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works that leads to eternal hell (Galatians 1:6-9). I want nothing to do with the hellbound catholic cult. Jesus hates catholicism and the idolatries of it. <br>  <br>  True salvation is by faith alone in Jesus. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|OR3TIDCeaa	Catholics sprinkle newborns.  This is their so-called "baptism".

Let's take a closer look at your question along with a good answer.<br>  <br>  ------------------<br>  Question: "Where is God now? Where is God when it hurts?"<br>  <br>  Answer: The Bible teaches that God reigns over the nations from His holy throne in Heaven (Psalm 47:8; Isaiah 6:1, 66:1; Hebrews 4:16). Even though we know that God’s presence is in some sense uniquely in Heaven, the teachings of Scripture also make it clear that God is omnipresent (present everywhere at the same time). From the beginning of Scripture, we see the presence of God hovering over the earth, even when it was still formless and empty (Genesis 1:2). God filled the world with His creation and His presence and glory continue to inhabit the whole earth (Numbers 14:21). There are many examples throughout Scripture of God’s presence moving amidst the earth, interacting with His creation (Genesis 3:8, Deuteronomy 23:14, Exodus 3:2, 1 Kings 19:11-18, Luke 1:35, Acts 16:7). Hebrews 4:13 says, “Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must given an account.” Jeremiah 23:24 exclaims, “‘Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see him?’ declares the Lord. ‘Do not I fill heaven and earth?’ declares the Lord.” Psalm 139 is an amazing study in God’s omnipresence.<br>  <br>  Where is God? If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, God is with you, beside you, above you, and inside you. God’s presence and watchful care never leaves you. If you are not a believer in Jesus Christ, God is right in front of you, inviting you, drawing you, offering you the love, mercy, and grace that He longs to give you. If you are unsure of your relationship with God through Jesus Christ, please read our article on how to “Get right with God.” Perhaps a better question than “Where is God?” is “Where are you, in relationship to God?”<br>  <br>  Where is God when it hurts? It seems we desire to know the answer to this question most when faced with painful trials and attacks of doubt. Even Jesus, during His crucifixion, asked, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46). To the onlookers of that time, as well as to those who first read the story, it seems that God did forsake Jesus, so we obviously conclude that He will forsake us as well in our darkest moments. Yet, upon continued observation of the events that unfolded after the crucifixion, the truth was revealed that nothing can separate us from the love of God, not even death (Romans 8:37-39). After Jesus was crucified, He was glorified (1 Peter 1:21, Mark 16:6,19; Romans 4:24-25). From this example alone we can be assured that even when we do not feel God’s presence in the midst of our pain, we can still believe His promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us (Hebrews 13:5). “God sometimes permits what he hates to accomplish what he loves” (Joni Erickson Tada).<br>  <br>  We put our trust in the fact that God does not lie, He never changes, and His word stands true forever (Numbers 23:19, 1 Samuel 15:29, Psalm 110:4, Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 7:21, 13:8, James 1:17, 1 Peter 1:25). We do not lose heart over painful circumstances because we live by faith in every word that has proceeded from the mouth of God, not putting our hope in what is seen or perceived. We trust God that our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs all the suffering that we will endure on this earth. So, we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, because we know and believe that what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal (2 Corinthians 4:16-18, 5:7). We also trust God’s Word which says He is constantly working things together for the good of those who love Him and have been called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28). Even though we do not always see the good ends to which God is working things out, we can be assured that a time will come when we will understand and see more clearly.<br>  <br>  Our lives are like the illustration of a quilt. If you look at the back side of a quilt, all you see is a mess of knots and loose ends hanging out all over. It is very unattractive and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the work. Yet when you turn the quilt over, you see how the maker has craftily woven together each strand to form a beautiful creation, much like the life of a believer (Isaiah 64:8). We live with a limited understanding for the things of God, yet a day is coming when we will know and understand all things (Job 37:5, Isaiah 40:28 Ecclesiastes 11:5, 1 Corinthians 13:12, 1 John 3:2). Where is God when it hurts? The message to take with you in hard times is that when you can’t see His hand, trust His heart, and know for certain that He has not forsaken you. When you seem to have no strength of your own, that’s when you can most fully rest in His presence and know that His strength is made perfect in your weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9-10).|`|Xtqq71KGaa	i heard he had a breakfast date with the muslim god this morning.  try denny's.|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	HE is in Heaven.|`|evBc5X82aa	he will you just have to wait

For example, denying oneself of an extravagant pleasure in order to accomplish a more demanding charitable deed. Thus, self-discipline is the assertion of willpower over more base desires, and is usually understood to be a synonym of 'self control'. Self-discipline is to some extent a substitute for motivation, when one uses reason to determine a best course of action that opposes one's desires<br>  <br>  <br>  ADAPT AND OVERCOME every being has the ability|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	"You know how lazy the average American is?

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	It's amazing how many Americans are in total denial that these tent cities exist all across the United States. <br>  <br>  I was in the USA in 2006 doing a television documentary on the homeless war veterans and 9/11 hero's in the United States and while filming and interviewing. We were invited by the homeless people we met, to see Americas never talked about hidden secret, "Tent Cities".  <br>  <br>  I've traveled all over the world and have never seen anything like them ever even in a third world country. Which many American families with young children were living in these squalid tent cities. Or living in a car with the parts and wheels sold to buy food or formula for infants and young children. <br>  <br>  The people I met all shared the same stories and shed the same tears after of living week to week on one pay check who lost their job and only income to pay rent and ending up living on the street, with no where to turn. <br>  <br>  Or families that had no money to pay off medical expenses for their sick child or a spouse. Who were evicted from their home by a sheriff to sell off all their personal assets and house to pay off the medical bills. Being made bankrupt so they were always knocked back of renting an apartment. <br>  <br>  Also elderly people evicted from aged care homes or a rented apartment when their insurance ran out and had relatives they could stay with living on the street or in a tent city eating pet food. <br>  <br>  All joining returned war veterans and 9/11 hero's who also share tents in these cities along side of these families. <br>  <br>  What really got me was a young four year old girl who was eating a bowl of cereal with water for her dinner. Who's mother told me her daughter didn't even know what milk tastes like. <br>  <br>  Even though I have returned back to my home in Australia. This whole experience still haunts me, especially seeing the current weather conditions in the USA. <br>  <br>  Knowing these families, children, aged, war veterans, 9/11 hero's and others like them are living out in the cold. While more mega churches are being built in the USA, and ignorant Americans complain about the tent cities and people who live in them. <br>  <br>  With how the way things are financially going downhill fast and as more Americans are becoming unemployed. It wont be long before many of these bias opinionated American people end up also living also with them.|`|PKULDaC7aa	They haven't really had to deal with the reality yet. Its impossible for people who have it all to relate to people who have nothing.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	Because they don't know how fragile the economy is.  And they are judgmental.|`|AA10300394	I wonder the same thing. I think they're stuck in the "that can't happen to me" mindset. Who knows.|`|AA11590332	Because tent cities are an eyesore and people are fickle.<br>  <br>   I personally don't like seeing people forced to suffer, neither do many others, so we discourage this behavior and try to ignore that the homeless exist.<br>  <br>  Also, tent cities attract not only people down on their luck, but druggies and drunks. And nobody wants that kind of thing in their neighborhood.<br>  <br>   These people need help, and I personally don't have what it takes to give it to them, and neither do millions of other people. Not being able to help is a hopeless feeling, so I don't like seeing the homeless and knowing I really can't do anything.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	I am with you 100%.  People don't seem to care until it happens to them.|`|oojO4WAraa	Because tent cities are a temporary solution.

Many Jewish Christians ALSO continued to participate in synagogue worship until they were kicked out of the synagogue. <br>  <br>  Paul often did this in an effort to teach Jews about Jesus. For instance:<br>  <br>  Acts 14:1 At Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue as usual. They spoke there with great power. Large numbers of Jews and non-Jews became believers. 2 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up those who weren’t Jews. They poisoned their minds against the two men and the new believers.<br>  <br>  Early Christian writers discuss meeting on Sunday over 100 years before the events Ellen White claims changed Christian worship from Saturday to Sunday. How could they be writing about it over a century before it was "changed?"  The truth is that MS White was very wrong and has led many away from Biblical truth.<br>  <br>  Justin Martyr, 1st Apology, 156A.D. But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Savior on the same day rose from the dead.<br>  <br>  Tertullian, "An answer to the Jews," c.200A.D. "In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practiced circumcision, and were thus rendered "friends of God.""<br>  <br>  In "Ad  Nationes," he says, "Others, with greater regard to good manners, it must be confessed, suppose that the sun is the god of the Christians... because we make Sunday a day of festivity..."|`|79ad59f9f6dc95895d6326a98387b8e4aa	My husband's grandparents were Adventist, very legalistic.

Uhm, hello...drug dealers are in the profession to MAKE money, not give it to government.  Which means they are just going to continue doing their business behind close doors and fight anyone who tries to interupt their process.|`|3b5d9eb668cf839229e6961fc16a8cc6aa	yes we should people do them anyway, the gov't should tax the stuff and have less people in trouble over pot, coke etc.|`|6e7b5e4c09f9e9723975f9066e10a8dbaa	I totally aggree. Legalize and regulate! But this pompous government is too dense!|`|8df11d168accf941bf3130e6f62ef19baa	People/government try to regulate people's morals. If they don't believe it's right for their own lives they try to prevent other people from doing what they want to with their lives. <br>  <br>  I think it would be a good idea, but if addicts couldn't afford the legal version, they'll go back to the black market.|`|ba17ef8658568a16c93852400d7c2a52aa	I think Chris Rock said it best "Because drugs come from countries run by brown people."  In this country you white millionaires who own tobacco and alcohol companies.  Both these products kill thousands of people a day, but the excuse is no on forced these people to use these products.  <br>  <br>  If these so called illegal drugs were treated the same it would probably take business away from these other companies.  Truth is some of these companies might actually start investing in drugs.|`|e28b009c9c725d4a56c72ae1a231a9d5aa	In a way that would be saying drugs are all right.<br>  With a limited dose,but then again drug dealers would just smuggle in more,which would be illegal...
57f0acfb16f577cbf6713186dae0a2eeaa	People who make racist remarks and comments are extremely small and insecure minded people. It is pathetic that people feel that they should judge a person by their ethnicity and skin colour. People who makes racist remarks in the street are disgraceful and one day they will get their commupence. <br>  As I am not of an ethnic background I have never been subjected to that type of remarks but I have had other things shouted at me in the street and I think that the best thing to do is  to just ignore them, even though that can be hard, and do not retalliate as you may end up getting into trouble. Also remember that you are bigger and better than those people and realise that if they have to do such cruel things as shout racist remarks at random people, then they will never be truly happy with themselves and they just really need to grow up!|`|294c186ac5e833f16f63cd9cf88458d2aa	Ignore them.  That's my best advise.|`|AA10262912	Its always best to just keep on walking.  Remember.."sticks and stones.."|`|AA10717095	One should resist the notion that he should respond to every provocation -- racist or otherwise.|`|1oChEEf0aa	If you agree, you should laugh and say, "You're a hell of a chap!". If you disagree you should stomp their f'in face.|`|191f13c7d415060dd58861ae7947eafeaa	Depend on the situation.  If I'm with my daughter, I'll ignore it and explain to my child why we should feel sorry for these people and not get mad at what they say because they are delusional.<br>  <br>  If I'm not with my child and someone says something to me personally, I'd verbally assault them until they felt about as big as a flea, then break them down even more.|`|59b9f44cc97529e1ff460f8518e5b3f9aa	It's best to just ignore it.<br>  <br>  If they're making racist remarks about you, that means they want to engage you.  Don't give them what they want.  They're feeding off of the negative attention.<br>  <br>  Or...<br>  <br>  I like to just come off with something random.  Tell 'em how nice the weather is and to have a good day.  lol  It pisses them off even more than responding the actual racist remarks.  Pisses them off even more when you react to their hatred with kindness and courtesy.

sp6P3e6saa	no creo que sea necesario el llegar en ningún momento a las ofensas y/o agresiones ya que todo se puede resolver por medio de un dialogo ya que si no, entonces es mejor quedarse cada quien con sus creencias y que sea lo mejor.

Yo también lo he vivido, lo relate en otra pregunta, estas cosas fue lo que me sucedieron:<br>  <br>  -Yo tenía 17 a?os, un chico, falso bisexual, un "caza-marikas", habló conmigo, decía ser bisexual, intentaba averiguar quien era para dejarme en rídiculo, me preguntaba quien conocía, de donde era, donde vivía, como no lo averiguaba, se empezó a reir y me dijo "mari-cón" al final de la conversación.<br>  <br>  -Yo tenía como 19 a?os y unos chavales de mi edad parece que se aburrían, uno se hizo pasar por homosexual, quedó conmigo diciendo que tenía deseos de conocer a alguien, y quién sabe si surgiera algo más, yo llegué primero al sitio donde quedamos, hablábamos por móvil(cellular), y para mi sorpresa eran dos chicos, el falso homosexual y su supuesto primo, yo llegué primero y empecé a conversar con ellos, me empezaron a insultar y me dijeron que esperara que me iban a pegar, dije que me iba y que me dejaran, y dijeron que si no les esperaba pegarían a gente de mi familia, mientras huía muy asustado me amenazaron de muerte por ser una "mari-cona".<br>  <br>  -La mas sonada y polémica, yo tenía como 20 a?os, el novio de una amiga se puso muy celoso de mi amistad con su novia, una noche que estabamos de acampada un grupo de amigos, estando a solas me vino preguntandome si estaba viendome con su novia, entonces le confesé ser homosexual para que se tranquilizara y no me viera como rival o que quería quitarle la novia, estaba tan obsesionado que se lo tomó como que yo era un pervertido sexual o algo así, y me dió mucha la lata, me calumnió ante muchas personas y me montó algunas escenitas, se dedicaba a retorcer todo lo que dijera. Se obsesionó conmigo y con el tema.<br>  <br>  -Tenía 21 a?os, quedé con alguien que decía ser homosexual, le dije mi dirección, yo esperaba en el recibidor, llegó un coche frente a mi casa, alguien dió unas fuertes patadas a la puerta y cuando salí no había nadie.<br>  <br>  -Una vez una ni?a me insultó diciéndome mar-icón.<br>  <br>  Y eso es todo, aun asi me parece puntual, no tengo queja y me siento bastante feliz y tranquilo, no considero haber sufrido, lo peor fue con el novio de mi amiga ya que fue un duro a?o, un a?o de obsesiones, criticas, difamaciones, paranoias y porque soy una persona pacífica, si hubiera tenido un minimo de agresividad nos habríamos pegado.<br>  Terminaron la relación porque el chico se descontrolo un monton y he vuelto a saber poco mas de el, es un paranoico, piensa mal de todo lo que ve.|`|1CI5aV3Faa	Yo no pero amistades que tengo si son descriminados por la sociedad Ignorantes que todavia existe en pleno sigloxx y es de dar lastima a esta gente que todavia cre que vive en el siglo pasado y se quedaron con sus Ideales viejos, absurdos,tontos,mediocres,hacia la sociedad pero esa gente es digna de dar lastima,pero amo, respeto,a todos (a) mis amigos(a) con difentes inclinaciones sexuales.|`|7d51bca630be9f92145c58ad25be0b10aa	Afortunadamente no he tenido ese tipo de problema hasta ahora, todos mis amigas y amigos me quieren tal como soy, es mas cuando sipueron que era gay siento que soy mas libre con ellos, y sobre todo que no ahi mentiras y me siento mejor y ellos tambien conmigo|`|eb1b40748de75f20090e5502e099f38eaa	Entre homosexuales me he sentido usado y discriminado.|`|25BcPFXJaa	SI, DEFINITIVAMENTE LA SUFRI UNA VEZ<<<< ES UNA HISTORIA VERDADERAMENTE LARGA PARA CONTAR PERO LA SUPE AFRONTAR MUY BIEN! <<<<br>  Livlu me encantan tus preguntas ejejej<br>  <br>  SALUDOS!<br>  p/d: no creen que todos los Fumanchuuuu!!! se merecen un denunciar abuso o bloquear usuario?|`|5BSB5zMVaa	NO SE SI CUENTE..

Con esa primita vivía yo desde que era una bebita recién nacida, su acusación era mas que enferma y retorcida, me monto un escandalo tal que todo mundo se olvido de que estaban reunidos allí por una persona muerta. Creeme que sus malas intenciones no llegaron a nada, porque mi primita era totalmente conciente y lo acuso de mentiroso ante su madre y delante de todos dijo que era un imbécil y que yo era como su hermana y que lo único que hizo fue dormir, mi compa?ero de apartamento también lo certifico.  De todas formas llore mucho y aun lo recuerdo y me duele, solo espero poder olvidarlo algún día y quitarme el odio que siento por él.<br>  Un abrazo linda.|`|UV9Q9wfxaa	si y lo peor es ke es por gente ke ni te konoce ,,, ke por el solo echo de parecerles homosexual o saber te dicen de kosas y enfrente de quien menos kieres lastimar ... es muy feo ,,,|`|ZJ2brd05aa	No precisamente por homosexualidad ya que soy heterosexual pero si hemos sidos criticados ya que mi esposo me lleva 15 a?os.|`|Zkd9toZnaa	la verdad si con my famili en especial mis primas dicen que no see de lo que me estoy perdiendo. pero noes asi cuando me introdusco entre sus brasos  no nesesito nada mas|`|d68f47debf36cc1d531340657aac15f1aa	Por unos compa?eros del colegio.

En réalité l’analogie va au-delà : nazisme et islamisme sont deux systèmes totalitaires qui présentent des similitudes et des synergies. <br>  <br>  L’islamisme moderne : retour à l’islam conquérant totalitaire Le mouvement des Frères Musulmans a été créé en Egypte en 1928 par Hassan el Banna. Au-delà d’une pratique individuelle de la religion, il s’agit d’un système politique qui affirme (1) la supériorité de l’homme musulman et (2) la nécessité de convertir le monde à l’islam, de reprendre la conquête dans les pas du prophète. La société qu’il préconise est organisée de manière totalitaire. Les régimes qui adoptent la charia comme seule constitution rejettent la démocratie et établissent un système ultra-policier. <br>  <br>  El Banna a défini une stratégie politique par étapes, du ralliement de la communauté de quartier à la grande nation islamique mondiale. L’outil de cette expansion est le djihad, qui est une guerre de conquête. La violence, individuelle ou collective, est autorisée, voire encouragée pour la cause. Hamas et Al Qua?da sont deux exemples d’organisations utilisant la doctrine d’el Banna. Certains leaders actuels estiment que l’Amérique et le Proche Orient tomberont par la guerre et l’Europe par la prédication et l’intimidation. <br>  Empathie entre islamisme et nazisme avant la seconde guerre mondiale <br>  <br>  El Banna avait de la sympathie pour le nazisme : ? Si le Reich allemand s’impose comme protecteur de tous ceux dont le sang allemand coule dans les veines, et bien la foi musulmane impose à chaque Musulman de se considérer comme protecteur de toute personne ayant été imprégnée de l’apprentissage coranique. ? <br>  <br>  Dans un ouvrage paru en 2004, le militant d’extrême droite italien contemporain Claudio Mutti affirme que la sympathie était réciproque : ? Hitler avait un faible pour la religion islamique ?. Cet engouement aurait été partagé par de nombreux dignitaires nazis et il alla, dans un nombre significatif de cas jusqu’à la conversion. Mutti inventorie les sympathies dont jouissait le nazisme dans le monde musulman. Il signale qu’en 1945, ? les Frères musulmans éliminèrent une haute personnalité égyptienne qui s’était déclarée favorable à l’entrée en guerre de l’Egypte contre l’Allemagne ?. <br>  <br>  Islamistes et nazis imposent le totalitarisme et la guerre pour protéger leur homme supérieur (le Musulman et l’arien respectivement) contre une menace extérieure. Islamistes et nazis se sont choisi la même menace : les Juifs. L’un des successeurs de Hassan el Banna, Sayd Qutb (1906-1966), est l’auteur de Mon combat (mein Kampf) contre les Juifs. <br>  La double haine envers les Juifs <br>  <br>  Pourquoi les Juifs ? La première haine des islamistes envers les Juifs est d’origine coranique : le prophète, une fois installé à La Mecque, s’est retourné contre les tribus arabes juives, ses anciens alliés, et ne leur a laissé de choix qu’entre extermination et conversion. Les passages du Coran de la période de La Mecque contiennent des affirmations virulentes contre les Juifs (et contre les Chrétiens, qui ont des pratiques pa?ennes comme la trinité). Ce sont ces passages que les islamistes mettent en exergue. <br>  <br>  La seconde source de haine est la?que. L’ouvrage de référence a été écrit en 1898 : il s’agit d’un pamphlet antisémite, les ? protocoles des sages de Sion ?. L’auteur, Mathieu Golovinsky, un agitateur travaillant pour la police tsariste à Paris, met en scène des leaders de la communauté juive (qui, bien entendu n’ont jamais existé) qui racontent comment ils s’y prennent pour dominer le monde. Depuis 1921, on a découvert que ces ? protocoles ? sont un faux (voir la remarquable bande dessinée de Will Eisner). Malgré cela, l’ouvrage a fait une carrière extraordinaire chez les nazis et chez les islamistes, qui l’utilisent depuis un siècle pour dénoncer le soi-disant ? complot juif ?. <br>  <br>  La charte du Hamas, à c?té de citations anti-juives du Coran (la haine théologique), se réfère aux ? protocoles ? et rend les Juifs responsables de tout ce qui ne va pas dans le monde, depuis la révolution fran?aise jusqu’à Isra?l. Ainsi l’article 22 : ? Depuis longtemps les ennemis [les Juifs] complotent, habilement et avec précision pour réaliser leurs objectifs … Avec leur argent,( ?) ils ont mis la main sur les médias du monde entier : presse, maisons d’édition, stations de radio etc… <br>  <br>  Avec leur argent, ils ont soulevé des révolutions dans plusieurs parties du monde afin de servir leurs intérêts et réaliser leur objectif. Ils sont derrière la révolution fran?aise, la révolution communiste et toutes les révolutions dont nous avons entendu parler. Avec leur argent, ils ont mis sur pied des sociétés secrètes comme les francs-ma?ons, les clubs Rotary, les Lions et autres dans différentes parties du monde, afin de saboter les sociétés et servir les intérêts sionistes. ( ?)<br>  <br>  Avec leur argent, ils sont parvenus à contr?ler les pays impérialistes et à les pousser à coloniser de nombreux pays pour exploiter leurs ressources et y propager la corruption … Ils ont été derrière la première guerre mondiale quand ils ont aboli le califat islamique, réalisant des gains financiers et contr?lant les ressources. Ils ont obtenu la déclaration Balfour, créé la Ligue des Nations pour diriger le monde. Ils ont été derrière la seconde guerre mondiale, à travers laquelle ils ont réalisé des gains financiers énormes en faisant le commerce des armes, et ont ouvert la voie à la création de leur état. ? <br>  Amin al Husseini <br>  <br>  Le personnage qui a beaucoup ?uvré pour le rapprochement entre le nazisme et le monde arabo-musulman est un nazi arabe, Mohamed Amin al Husseini (1897-1974). Amin est issu d’une famille de notables qui s’est enrichie au 19ème siècle sur le dos des paysans palestiniens, juifs et arabes. Grace à leur position de collecteurs d’imp?ts, les notables arabes avaient extorqué la terre aux fellahs, écrasés de dettes. Quelques années plus tard, les mêmes notables revendaient cette terre aux paysans sionistes, en faisant des bénéfices de 4000%. <br>  <br>  Amin se passionne pour l’agitation politique. Il profite de sa fonction de grand Mufti de Jérusalem pour accro?tre son action et crée un ? haut comité arabe ?. Depuis 1921, ce comité a déclenché des massacres de Juifs en Palestine. Le motif avancé pour monter les Arabes contre leurs voisins juifs est régulièrement l’annonce de la destruction de la mosquée de Jérusalem par les Juifs. Comme le note l’historienne Renée Neher Bernheim, ? l’hostilité des Arabes contre les Juifs, qui apparaissait surmontable jusque dans les années 1930, se transforme assez vite en une haine qui devient aussi ? viscérale ? que l’antisémitisme allemand. ? Amin al Husseini joue un r?le déterminant dans la création de ce fossé entre les communautés palestiniennes. <br>  <br>  Amin s’est lié d’amitié avec Eichmann et Hitler. Lorsqu’il visite un camp d’extermination, il presse les nazis d’accélérer les cadences du massacre industriel de Juifs. Après la guerre, recherché par les Anglais pour crimes de guerre, il est exfiltré en Egypte par les Fran?ais qui pensent en faire leur pion au Proche Orient. Il reprend aussit?t son activité anti-juive obsessionnelle et lève des troupes arabes pour écraser l’état juif palestinien qui vient de décréter son indépendance. Les Frères Musulmans mobilisent massivement dans ce conflit. <br>  <br>  Jusqu’à sa mort il n’aura de cesse de recréer des réseaux nazis en Egypte et en Syrie. Il jouera également un r?le diplomatique important dans le monde arabe. <br>  La plate-forme nazie du Caire <br>  <br>  Après 1945 (et plus particulièrement entre 1948 et 1952), des centaines de nazis trouvent refuge au Caire et à Damas. Beaucoup se convertissent à l’islam, voire à l’islam radical. Non seulement les nazis jouissent de l’impunité la plus totale, mais souvent ils sont recherchés comme conseillers des dirigeants syriens et égyptiens. Embusqués aux frontières d’Isra?l, ils peuvent ainsi continuer leur combat contre les Juifs, formulant et diffusant une propagande anti-juive intense. Les observateurs étrangers notaient avec surprise la similitude entre caricatures de la presse arabe avec celles de la presse nazie d’avant guerre. Cette similitude est due à l’influence ? culturelle ? des nazis qui sont sur place. <br>  <br>  Alois Brunner (Ali Mohamed), l’un des adjoints d’Eichmann, met en place la torture en Syrie. Johann von Leers (Johann Omar Amin von Leers, 1902-1965), principal collaborateur de Goebbels, crée au Caire un ? institut de recherche ? sur le sionisme. Leopold Gleim (an-Nasir), ancien chef de la Gestapo en Pologne, forme les cadres des services de sécurité égyptiens. Ludwig Heiden (al Hadj), ancien membre de l’Office central de sécurité du Reich, traduit Mein Kampf en arabe. Ils publient aussi de nouveaux traités racistes, en arabe, en allemand et en anglais : Talmudic Human Sacrifices (1962), The Danger of World Jewry for Islam (1963), Why I hate Isra?l (1964), Sexual Crimes of the Jews (1965). Von Leers a joué un r?le majeur dans la diffusion et le financement de thèses négationnistes dans le monde. <br>  <br>  L’un des coups d’éclat des nazis du Caire fut de mettre en échec le pape dans son propre concile. En 1962, lors du Concile Vatican II, à l’initiative du cardinal allemand Bea, le pape Jean XXIII voulait purger la tradition chrétienne de textes anti-juifs. Mais peu avant l’ouverture du Concile, un ouvrage intitulé ? le complot contre l’Eglise ?, signé d’un énigmatique ? Maurice Pinay ?, parut simultanément en plusieurs langues et fut très largement diffusé dans les milieux chrétiens du monde entier. Selon l’historien Léon Poliakov, Gleim et Heiden se cachaient derrière le pseudonyme Maurice Pinay : ? Ils avaient tiré de leur sac toutes les vieilles ficelles nazies : le cardinal Bea était juif, ses collègues occidentaux avaient été bernés ou corrompus, l’église romaine était entachée de l’hérésie juda?que. Du Moyen-Orient à l’Amérique latine, nombre de prélats se laissèrent impressionner, et au Concile, les protestations et les amendements fusèrent. ? Cet épisode révèle les moyens considérables dont disposait à l’époque la plate forme nazie du Caire. <br>  Islamistes et nationalistes arabo-musulmans : la surenchère anti-juive <br>  <br>  Les islamistes s’opposent violemment aux dirigeants nationalistes des pays musulmans. Ils leur reprochent de diviser ? la grande nation arabe ?, de suivre des modèles occidentaux et d’être corrompus. Renverser ces chefs d’état est l’une des étapes de la prise de pouvoir selon El Banna. C’est ainsi que les islamistes ont tué Sadate, qui avait osé faire la paix avec Isra?l. <br>  <br>  Les dirigeants nationalistes le leur rendent bien et la répression est impitoyable. Mais il y a un terrains sur lequel se fait la surenchère : la propagande anti-juive. Ainsi on distribue les ? protocoles ? dans les aéroports, on les enseigne dans les écoles, des clowns déguisés en savants se produisent quotidiennement sur les télévisions nationales arabes pour fabuler sur le thème des ? protocoles ?, expliquant que la shoah n’a jamais existé, que c’est une invention des Juifs et racontant comment l’Allemagne na?ve s’est fait extorquer des indemnités. Les négationnistes et les racistes occidentaux font fortune dans les pays arabo-musulmans où on les félicite d’avoir eu le courage de ? défier ? le ? lobby ?. <br>  <br>  Le public fran?ais incrédule a découvert ce nouveau racisme en septembre 2001, lors de la Conférence des ONG contre le racisme à Durban : des soi-disant ? anti-racistes ? rendaient hommage à Hitler et voulaient achever son ? ?uvre ? ! <br>  Combattre l’islamisme <br>  <br>  Les sociétés musulmanes sont aujourd’hui déconnectées de la réalité, abandonnées à une propagande raciste qui se propage grace à la surenchère entre islamistes et nationalistes. Le conflit du Proche Orient, réinterprété selon des mythes de complot, est évidemment une manne pour les islamistes et leur discours de victimisation. <br>  <br>  Quel régime musulman aura le courage d’éradiquer la double haine ? Qui soutiendra les intellectuels musulmans qui réhabilitent les passages du Coran de l’apostolat de Médine et les versets positifs ou simplement neutres sur les Juifs ? Qui purgera de l’enseignement les ? protocoles ? et les théories négationnistes ? Cette rupture majeure fera sortir le moyen age des sociétés musulmanes, et leur permettra de s’ouvrir sur le respect -y compris le respect des femmes et des minorités- et sur la démocratie. C’est aussi le carburant intellectuel du terrorisme qui serait tari. <br>  <br>  Paul Foster <br>  <br>  [1] <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islamophile.org/spip/article410.html," rel="nofollow">http://www.islamophile.org/spip/article4...</a> cité par Paul Landau <br>  <br>  2) <a href="http://www.tilsafe.com/libfr/0...-LFI.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.tilsafe.com/libfr/0...-LFI.ht...</a> [2] <br>  <br>  [3] <br>  Notes <br>  <br>  [1] 1) Hassan al-Banna, Ep?tre aux jeunes <br>  <br>  [2] Le site propose nombre d’ouvrages d’extrême droite. <br>  <br>  [3] 3) Pour les nazis, les races inférieures sont condamnées à mourir ou à être esclaves.

Protocoles des Sages de Sion ? ont été écrits à la demande du chef de la police tsariste à Paris. Celui-ci conspirait contre les réformes envisagées par le tsar. Le pamphlet atteindra son objectif puisque après l’avoir lu, le tsar se séparera de ses ministres réformateurs et engagera une politique de répression. L’auteur, Mathieu Golovinsky, pressé par le temps, avait plagié et adapté un ouvrage de Maurice Joly paru en 1871 : ? dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu ?. Maurice Joly, authentique démocrate fran?ais, y dénon?ait le totalitarisme de Napoléon III et expliquait dans le ? Machiavel ? comment l’empereur avait privé les Fran?ais jusqu’à l’idée de liberté. Dans les ? Protocoles ?, Napoléon III est remplacé par une assemblée de ? sages ? juifs. Le Times révélait en 1921 que les ? protocoles ? ne sont qu’un faux, fabriqué en plagiant l’ouvrage de Maurice Joly. Les ? sages ? sont le fruit de l’imagination de Golovinsky.|`|Kz5bAp5saa	Je trouve cela très beau et je te remercie pour ces voeux...Pour moi cela sera plus simpliste, j'éspère juste que tu auras toi et ta famille une belle année 2008 avec pleins de bonheur à partager...<br>  <br>  <br>  Flori@ne|`|Ou1gjf1Eaa	Jésus(salut de Dieu sur lui) n'est pas né le 25 décembre...d'ailleurs les historiens remettent en cause aujourd'hui cette date et le calendrier gegorien. Le 25 décembre été une fête pa?enne, la fête d'un dieu soleil ou un truk kom ca, et les Chrétiens, afin d'attirer vers leur religion les pa?ens, ont adoptés cette date du 25 décembre comme jour de fête.<br>  <br>  Le Coran montre d'ailleurs(depuis 14 siècles) que Jésus n'est pas né en cette période:<br>  <br>  sourate 19(Maryam):<br>  <br>  22. Elle devint donc enceinte [de l'enfant], et elle se retira avec lui en un lieu éloigné.<br>  <br>  23. Puis les douleurs de l'enfantement l'amenèrent au tronc du palmier, et elle dit: "Malheur à moi! Que je fusse mort avant cet instant! Et que je fusse totalement oubliée!"<br>  <br>  24. Alors, il l'appela d'au-dessous d'elle[1], [lui disant:] "Ne<br>  t'afflige pas. Ton Seigneur a placé à tes pieds une source.<br>  <br>  25. Secoue vers toi le tronc du palmier: il fera tomber sur toi des dattes fra?ches et m?res.<br>  <br>  26. Mange donc et bois et que ton oeil se réjouisse! Si tu vois<br>  quelqu'un<br>  d'entre les humains, dis [lui:] "Assurément, j'ai voué un je?ne au Tout<br>  Miséricordieux: je ne parlerai donc aujourd'hui à aucun être humain".<br>  <br>  27. Puis elle vint auprès des siens en le portant [le bébé]. Ils<br>  dirent:<br>  "? Marie, tu as fait une chose monstrueuse!<br>  <br>  28. "Soeur de Harun, ton père n'était pas un homme de mal et ta mère n'était pas une prostituée".<br>  <br>  29. Elle fit alors un signe vers lui [le bébé]. Ils dirent: "Comment<br>  parlerions-nous à un bébé au berceau?"<br>  <br>  30. Mais (le bébé) dit: "Je suis vraiment le serviteur d'Allah. Il m'a donné le Livre et m'a désigné Prophète.<br>  <br>  31.

AZ4eEFSVaa	Mira, para empezar la santa Muerte no existe, eso tenlo por seguro, es una cosa que inventaron los humanos pero no existe. Lo de adorar a los Santos y a sus imágenes esta muy mal, a ellos no los puedes adorar, nadamas a Dios, ese es el problema con mucha gente, que adoran a los santos y piensan que son mejores que Dios, los santos solo son para que les pidas que le digan a Dios hacerca de algún pedido tuyo, nadamas para eso, puedes platicar con ellos, etc., pero siempre sabiendo que Dios es superior y sabiendo que si les pides algo ellos se lo tienen que pedir a Dios y el es quien te lo concede o decide si que hacer con esa petición, recuerda que Dios dice a los pedidos: Si, Todavía no, o No es lo que estaba pensando para ti, nunca te dice que no.<br>  <br>  Las imagenes y las cosas no son milagrosas, nadamas es si tienes mucha fe de que si le pides a un santo o a una imagen de el que interceda por ti. También recuerda que los humanos con la fe, tenemos la capacidad de mover monta?as etc., si tenemos mucha fe en Dios, y sabiendo de que si le pides a el te lo va a cumplir.<br>  <br>  No creas en las cosas que dicen de alabar a las imagenes, etc., eso no se debe hacer.<br>  <br>  Espero que te habrá servido lo anterior y me consideres como mejor respuesta para ganarme los 10 puntos, adiós.|`|537285ddad1057c60fb1746d9a532649aa	hola mira existe la muerte, los humanos le hemos puesto una figura para representarla, y la muerte no es mas que una transición no existe como un ente espiritual sino que simplemente es un paso, ahora preguntate, quien la hizo santa? la canonizaron? la gente en general la santifico por sus buenas obras?, si después de hacerte estas preguntas decides hacerte devota de ella, bien.

b25057d7d25151dd6b6089635baa13c9aa	come direbbe un comico: la domanda è malposta!!<br>  <br>  non ti offendere... pero' io le ho studiate queste cose... e devi sapere che non si può mai parlare, nelle scienze sociali, di relazioni così (diciamo) ben definite... nel senso che le relazioni esatte, come appunto quella direttamente proporzionale, le ritroviamo solo in natura (fisica, chimica) oppure in matematica.<br>  <br>  quindi TU parli della RELAZIONE (senza le parole "direttamente" e "proporzionale") che c'è tra il grado di emancipazione delle donne e il numero di divorzi. <br>  In effetti questa tua considerazione è vera in parte... naturalmente quando è stato dato ANCHE alle donne il diritto (e il potere) di chiedere il divorzio questi sono aumentati....<br>  ma il fatto che le donne hanno avuto questa "scelta" non ti deve far pensare che tutte abbiano optato per la fine del matrimonio (infatti anche mia nonna non ha divorziato, e neanche i miei genitori).<br>  La questione dei matrimoni che non durano più non può essere legata solo all'emancipazione femminile, ma va di pari passo alle trasformazioni/cambiamenti che sta vivendo la nostra società in questo periodo storico.<br>  <br>  non credo vi siano dubbi sul quesito che poni riguardo a quale società sia meglio (quella di oggi o quella di una volta): infatti (ma questa è un'opinione personale, che spero tu possa condividere)  penso che sia meglio vivere in una società in cui le donne sono libere (io penso a mia madre e mia sorella) piuttosto di avere una società dove i matrimoni siano più duraturi che pero' non rispetta le donne (ti ricordo che prima le donne potevano esercitare pochissimi diritti ed ogni loro scelta era condizionata ad un SI del padre o del marito.... non è meglio ora che almeno anche loro possono decidere cosa fare della loro vita?? ma ti immagini se TU fossi nato donna 50 anni fà?? sai quanti sacrifici avresti dovuto fare?? se ci rifletti allora ti sembrerà tutto più chiaro.<br>  <br>  ciao, scusa se sono stato un po' saccente (non so neanche quanti anni hai!) pero' ti posso dire che fai bene a discutere di queste cose (se ne hai voglia) e a cercare un confronto su questi temi così importanti!!! <br>  in bocca al lupo|`|bZTZ9Y80aa	qst è  davvero grossa!! nn avevo mai sentito qst "fatto inconfutabile"!!<br>  secondo me è una grande c*****a cn qlke accento maskilista!<br>  se i matrimoni finiscono nn è certo a causa dell'emancipazione delle donne,ma solo dell'immaturità e dell'egoismo, del fatto di nn sapere affrontare una vita a due e i problemi ke s presentano! è colpa anke dell'estrema facilità cn cui s arriva al matrimonio.....bisogna pensarci bene! anke i miei nonni sn stati sposati tutta la vita (ben 54 anni)  e di certo nn xkè mia nonna nn era una manager!|`|fLoyeLXeaa	L'incremento dei divorzi è ovviamente misurabile in termini matematici mentre l'incremento dell'emancipazione femminile altrettanto ovviamente non lo è. Quindi non si può stabilire una relazione proporzionale tra i due fenomeni. Però il tuo discorso contiene una idea di fondo sicuramente corretta che io esprimerei in questo modo: nella società attuale la causa principale del fallimento dei matrimoni è la giustissima rivendicazione, da parte della donna, di un ruolo diverso da quello tradizionale, che il marito per lo più non è disposto a concederle. Detto in modo estremamente semplificato: una volta l'uomo nel matrimonio era preposto alle relazioni esterne e la donna a quelle interne alla famiglia. Oggi non è più così e i matrimoni che funzionano sono quelli nei quali marito e moglie sono contenti di condividere e di suddividersi entrambi i ruoli, a partire dalle cose più semplici tipo le incombenze domestiche del cucinare, lavare i panni ecc., per arrivare a quelle più complesse del lavoro fuori casa e della gestione dei beni comuni. E io personalmente sono convinto che a queste condizioni si possa ancora credere nel matrimonio.|`|aa2c0c918bb524044497a9ffe6d50016aa	No, non credo che dipenda da questo.<br>  Nessuna donna, anche se lavora ed è indipendente economicamente, affronta con gioia un divorzio.<br>  Forse sono le incapacità di entrambi i coniugi a determinare il divorzio.|`|4e82a3f9fb6b4af93979b884f562c43daa	sono d' accordo con quello che dici!!!!!!<br>  una volta le coppie si sposavano per la vita intera....e superavano le difficoltà assieme...e la parola Divorzio non esisteva...!!!!ed era molto meglio...<br>  ora invece alla prima lite se ne vanno...e il grave é che non pensano neppure hai loro figli....al dolore che gli creano con una separazione!!!!!<br>  ma ora tutti pensano per loro e non gli importa di far soffrire altre persone!!!!<br>  la maggioranza si sposa per fare  apparenza quel giorno da protagonismo e basta!!!!!! ciaoooo

LPLR81t5aa	A ver... ?Que entiendes por travestido?<br>  <br>  Travestido es aquel que se viste con ropas del sexo opuesto. Habitualmente con tintes provocativos, sensuales.<br>  Si no hay tanto travestido en Rusia, será porque hace un frio que te mueres, y no es plan de ir con corto vestido sexy o con minifalda. No existe ropa provocativa femenina en grandes abrigos y gorros que te tapan todo el cuerpo.<br>  <br>  Y aparte, Rusia es un país donde las relaciones sociales están mas relacionado con lo intrafamiliar que la calle y las amistades, debido al terrible frio y tambien debido a que es un pais mas conservador, ve a Rusia a ver cuantos locales y Disco′s ves en comparación con Italia, Grecia, Espa?a.<br>  <br>  En rusia ha habido manifestaciones de homosexuales por sus derechos, pero ha habido contramanifestaciones y ha habido agresiones, si hay problema con la homosexualidad imaginate con el travestismo. Rusia es un pais todavía anclado en un fuerte conservadurismo, no se vive el ambiente social mas liberal de paises del sur.<br>  <br>  Claro que hay travestidos en Rusia, pero se travisten en la intimdad, y publicamente los ves en zonas concretas alejadas de ojos mirones, no los ves por la calle como si tal cosa.|`|413a56caac02651b2f20b234df3a5fd9aa	Por ya hay muchos en Buenos Aires, en Estados Unidos, en...<br>  <br>  Hay en todo el mundo, no hay que discriminar, pero si que haya una zona donde sea solo para ellos y no molesten en la vía pública con sus partes al aire.<br>  <br>  saludos|`|cfbdfab54e3e1042962f6a1437831f82aa	Olá,Sou Brasileiro e Gay,<br>  bem...isso que você falou é um pouco sem lógica.<br>  Você nem está aqui para ver se é verdade.<br>  Aqui no Brasil nao existem tantos travestis como parece,<br>  a maioria dos gays aqui nem coragem de se assumir tem, o preconceito aqui ainda é muito grande, e sim,existem bastante travestis aqui mesmo mas n?o s?o tantos,a maioria deles s?o "garotas de programa", na minha opini?o a maioria dos gays aqui n?o s?o afeminados,a maioria deles s?o machos e muito machos mesmo!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  bjuu|`|fd55ff703f205216e228f04faf22b379aa	No lo sabia, si se que hay gran liberacion sexual... y es que ademas alli tienen unos cuerpos que ....... bueno pero tambien unas caritas medio....... mejor los latinos  mas comunes como nosotros..|`|l0Y0Uriyaa	bueno te cuento yo vivi en brazil, y talvez es porq tienen muchos menos problemas con eso de la vestimenta y todo eso. no era raro ver a una chica en top, y un llorcito, y a nadie se le iva ocurrir  decir algo, no tienen tanto problema con el cuerpo, o porq te crees q son tan deseadas la mujeres de alla.<br>  <br>  besos y chau.<br>  <br>  ???giyi???|`|25BcPFXJaa	PORQUE AMAN EL CARNAVAL Y LAS PLAYAS!!<br>  <br>  viva!! el orgullo gay 2007!!  jejeje<br>  <br>  saludos!|`|weKuNY5uaa	pues de ver tanta vieja buena les dieron ganas de parecerse jaja

oIyHNKTAaa	Mi viene da pensare a Zeus, che nella filosofia greca, da divinità carnale e bisbetica era diventato il simbolo di qualcosa di diverso, sino ad arrivare all'Uno del Neoplatonismo, disincarnato e perfetto. Un Dio dei filosofi, e dei pensatori... a cui tanto la teologia cristiana è debitrice.<br>  <br>  Gli dei sono porte su di un mistero più grande... nascono animali, si tramutano in uomini, diventano figure geometriche... è il pensiero umano che si evolve correndo lungo il filo che porta alla pura astrazione...<br>  <br>  Ma io preferisco le divinità rissose e bizzarre del vero politeismo, l'astrazione perfetta del filosofo teologo rischia di essere intransigente quanto i precetti di una divinità arcaica... la pluralità di un mondo che rispecchia quello umano è senza dubbio più vicina alla mia personale sensibilità. E se da questo ci può essere un'evoluzione... potrebbe essere verso tanti Assoluti piuttosto che uno solo.<br>  <br>  Tanti quanto sono gli uomini, non è vero Lucifero?|`|BW4QAFXIaa	Get a life!!!!|`|cXRzO28Raa	Siamo portati a trattare Dio come un uomo, come uno di noi (tu che scrivi la lettera, come se Dio sapesse leggere, quelli che gli parlano, come se Dio sapesse ascoltare, quelli che dicono che Dio ama, come se provasse addirittura i sentimenti umani - che sono una causa della nostra imperfezione- ecc..).<br>  Questo è normale, perchè la nostra cultura ci insegna che noi siamo fatti a sua immagine e somiglianza, e l'uomo in generale non può (non vuole) accettare di non poter entrare in contatto con Dio.<br>  Io non so se Dio esiste o meno, so però che se mai esistesse non sarebbe di certo un uomo, tanto meno saprebbe parlare, ascoltare, fare progetti, amare, odiare ecc.<br>  Queste sono tutte qualità umane e noi tendiamo ad affibiarle a Dio per renderlo più simile a noi (più umano, appunto), perchè da sempre l'uomo ha paura del diverso e della diversità.<br>  Il cristianesimo, addirittura, identificando Dio in una persona ha toccato il culmine dell'umanizzazione di Dio, e questo spiega in parte perchè questa religione ha avuto così successo nel mondo: c'è un Dio che prova i sentimenti umani più nobili, che addirittura è stato umano, come noi.<br>  Anche alcune antiche religioni avevano capito il trucco dell'umanizzazione di Dio, il modo più semplice, veloce e promettente per garantirsi la credulità di molte genti (vedi gli egizi, che identificavano il faraone come uno dei loro dei, i greci, che addirittura credevano che gli dei fossero così umani da riuscire ad accoppiarsi con noi generando prole ecc..).<br>  Tuttavia la religione greca antica, che dalle tue precedenti risposte e dal tuo nome mi pare tu conosca molto bene (non a caso quella greca, la grecia è infatti la culla della filosofia) ha ipotizzato anche altro: il fato, più potente di ogni Dio, e nella formulazione della genealogia degli dei hanno dato a Kronos (il tempo) il rango di padre di Zeus.<br>  Se proviamo a "prendere" Dio e lo spogliamo di tutte le qualità umane infatti non rimane altro che il tempo.|`|lnjwZSUSaa	Sa caro Lucifero se conoscessi veramente Dio e sapessi la potenza che c'è nel sangue di Gesù non parleresti in questo modo.<br>  Sai stavo per perdere i miei due bambini entrambi x assenza di battito ma ho invocato il mio Signore e loro sono  qui e io posso abbracciarli.. Per chi non crede è impossibile guardare con un altra prospettiva, ma x me che credo vedo il Suo intervento divino in ogni giorno.  Non giudico ma neanche tu puoi  farlo ognuno ha le sue idee io non pretendo che tu creda, ma anche tu non pretendere di cambiare chi crede, perché per chi ha conosciuto Dio in circostanze meravigliose non può dire che Dio è stato solo un romanzo. Lui era il Dio di eri è il Dio di oggi e il Dio di domani.|`|7o8kuvcxaa	c'e' molta profondita' in cio' che scrivi!<br>  <br>  Bella domanda,per chi sa leggere tra le righe..oltre che le righe.|`|8OWEczGZaa	Certo Dio tace con te, una persona che manca di una qualità importante quale è la sincerità, come spera di trovare la verità?<br>  <br>  Dio ti benedica lucifero, demonologo, silvano e chissa quanti altri!<br>  <br>  Voi mi cercherete e mi troverete, perché mi cercherete con tutto il vostro cuore; (Geremia 29:13)|`|rOnOXSiDaa	Io fossi in te scriverei ai capi religiosi Ebrei che tornarono dall'esilio in Babilonia e che per riottenere un lembo di terra che non era loro da secoli scrissero questo bellissimo libro che è la Bibbia.

Ma ci massacra (o ci fa massacrare) come bestie (Gravina docet).<br>  Ha detto "Porgi l'altra guancia". Ma non perdona.<br>  Ha detto "Pregate senza stancarvi mai... Chiedete e vi sarà dato". Ma non mi risulta che qualche preghiera sia stata esaudita.<br>  Ha promesso protezione. Ma il male impazza in ogni sua forma.<br>  E' un Dio che predica bene ma razzola molto, molto male.<br>  Non sono ateo e sono credente. Ho studiato la Bibbia fino al punto di convircemi che questo Dio ci tratta solo come burattini o peggio come cavie da esperimento. Che ne pensi del caso di Giobbe quando tutta la sua famiglia viene stermintata (da Dio), e lo stesso Giobbe ridotto nell'indigenza per una scommessa (squallido a dirsi) con il Diavolo?<br>  Dove era Dio quando milioni di ebrei (il Suo popolo) si avviava allo sterminio pregando il Suo nome?<br>  Dove era Dio mentre i fratellini di Gravina languivano (e morivano atrocemente) in quella cisterna.?<br>  Forse Dio vorrebbe provare la medesima morte (ma tanto sa di essere immortale) poiché ha detto "Non fare agli altri ciò che non vuoi sia fatto a te".<br>  Quanta ipocrisia c'é nella Bibbia.<br>  In quanto a me, so che Dio esiste, ma so anche che non merita neanche mezza attenzione.<br>  E poi la Chiesa, nata in povertà, ma strabordante di lusso e di vizi. Ed ha pure il coraggio di chiedere altri soldi.|`|hLtwdj9uaa	che dire amico,<br>  se il Dio buono e giusto ci fosse davvero<br>  dubito che ci saremmo ridotti così,<br>  direi che razionalizzando sembri piuttosto difficile credere in quel Dio<br>  un tarlo che mi preoccupa di più però ce l'ho:<br>  "la sfiga pare esistere!"<br>  che ne pensi?|`|YokrL0Uqaa	amen

e43po7CRaa	guarda ti racconto la mia esperienza: da piccola dove abitavo io c'era una famiglia di cinque persone, erano tre figli, sempre mezzi dimessi, con le scarpe usate, non avevano giocattoli,quando mia madre ci mandava in cortile a giocare con la merenda, qualunque cosa fosse, ti guardavano con occhi sgranati!, avevano sempre fame, così magari mia mammma faceva due biscotti in più, o qualche panino al cioccolato in più.<br>  un giorno mamma mi ricordo che mi disse che poverini avevano dovuto prendere i libri e i vestiti in regalo dalla parrocchia perchè erano poveri! saranno stati pure poveri ma erano molto maleducati e cercavano sempre di rubarmi i giochi e se nn ci riuscivano cercavano di romperceli,picchiavano tutti ed erano sempre arrabbiati!<br>  sono passati gli anni e verso le scuole medie all'improvviso dall'oggi al domani spariscono...mistero. noi bambinetti non si chiedeva molto ai genitori che bisbigliavano e ci liquidavano con "cose da grandi!"......<br>  l'ho scoperto anni dopo quando una volta mia madre (ero cresciuta abbastanza si vede!) mi raccontò che erano spariti lasciando conti da pagare in tutte le botteghe del quartiere,avevano inoltre scoperto che si erano manomessi il contatore della luce e per anni l'avevano "presa in prestito" da quella del palazzo, e dulcis in fundo uno dei nostri viciniaveva scoperto che si erano messi da parte nel corso degli anni un mucchio di soldi, s'erano comprati un terreno e fatti una bella villona in non so che paese vicino roma....capito i poveretti?<br>  mia madre mi confidò di esserci rimasta malissimo lei e tutte le vicine di casa avevano spesso organizzato collette per quella famiglia, anche con sacrifici....visto che io sono cresciuta in una famiglia "normale" quella di una volta per intenderci, dove a lavorare era solo il papà e la mamma faceva i conti per la spesa!<br>  CON QUESTO NON VOGLIO FARE DI TUTT'ERBA UN FASCIO,perchè purtroppo con l'euro la situazione si è fatta veramente triste......ma bisogna andarci piano, io stessa sostengo quando posso due associazioni, ma sono serie e soprattutto di vecchia data. e si occupano di bambini, una in italia e una all'estero.|`|4b8f512dac968cc22c4661f0a9f1f8ccaa	Purtroppo ho visto le Onlus nascere, gli sponsor per la fame ..ecc..all'estero...ecc...<br>  Lo vuoi sapere dove finiscono al 90%.....pensaci.<br>  Purtroppo non sto parlando per parlare.<br>  Forse qui guadagnano di piu' i maghi, non ricordo i nomi.<br>  Ma anche la carita' e' diventato un grosso business.<br>  Che schifo!<br>  L'unica cosa che alcuni hanno cominciato per interesse, e sembra che oggi lo vivano davvero.<br>  Mas vanitas vanitatis..no!<br>  Di nuovo, che schifo!|`|cXRzO28Raa	Più di 1 anno fa ho fatto un'esperienza per me molto significativa di un mese nel nord dell'Argentina. Ho visto le favelas, ci sono entrato e per quanto mi riguarda, in Italia, esseri umani nelle loro condizioni non li ho mai visti.<br>  <br>  Più in generale, posso dirti che i pochi viaggi che ho fatto mi hanno fatto capire che in realtà gli esseri umani sono quasi uguali tra loro, in qualsiasi parte del mondo vivano, solo che noi, ogni volta che ci relazioniamo con gli altri non mettiamo in risalto le somiglianze (che sono sconcertanti) ma le differenze (che tutto sommato non sono così significative come appaiono in un primo  momento).<br>  Quindi, a mio parere, la beneficenza si può fare a chi si vuole, perchè siamo tutti esseri umani in ugual modo.<br>  Gli italiani ricevono la beneficenza di chi gliela vuole dare, gli africani altrettanto.<br>  Non trovo giusto attribuire agli italiani una sorta di "preferenza umanitaria", magari perchè li riteniamo più simili a noi. Il tempo mi ha insegnato che siamo tutti molto simili. Il fatto che noi siamo Italiani, francesi, Congolesi, Argentini, Cinesi, ecc... è dovuto ad una serie di guerre e giochi di potere. Il caso dei confini geografici africani, poi, tracciati a righello da noi occidentali (con tutte le drammatiche conseguenze che ciò ha portato e sta portando...) è eclatante.... Ma anche l'Italia, che fino alla seconda guerra mondiale era più estesa a nord-est.

Na verdade é necessário saber extrair proteínas e outros nutrientes de insetos, pequenos animais, raízes e plantas, bem como conhecer o que é coméstivel e o que é veneno. Se n?o tiver um GPS e um mapa que dê a localiza??o, convém escolher um rumo e seguir reto, tanto quanto possível, pois se ficar girando em círculo n?o chegará a parte alguma. Em princípio pode-se comer lagartas e frutas que pequenos animais e pássaros comem, com cuidado, pois eles ingerem barro para neutralizar o veneno de alguns. é possível encontrar mel (de abelha, de aripuá, de inchuí etc). é preciso garantir a alimenta??o e n?o se ferir em acidente, sen?o as chances de sobrevivência desaparecem. Se encontrar um curso d′água, siga-o, improvise uma jangada com toras amarradas com cipós, pois certamente chegará a um rio maior e a local habitado. é possível andar, no mínimo, 10 km por dia. Em 30 dias ser?o 300 km. Mesmo no meio da selva amaz?nica se encontrará alguma casa ou povoa??o dentro desse espa?o.

9bd483ed26228f2d38b057882dbdfe6eaa	Onestamente non vedo il collegamento tra il concetto che Gesù sia dio e il fatto che i primi cristiani battezzavano i catecumeni nel suo nome; le prime comunità cristiane -a quanto ne so -non consideravano la Madonna come una divinità, e quindi si potrebbe anche chiedersi, secondo la logica della tua domanda come mai i cristiani oggi la considerino tale. Oppure ci si potrebbe chiedere come mai oggi nessuno prega Iupiter nonostante il fatto che vi era chi lo faceva migliaia di anni fa.<br>  quello che tu hai citato. logicamente, a mio parere non dimostra che Gesù sia un dio; si limita ad affermare che i primi cristiani battezzavano in suo nome.<br>  Se invece quello che tu hai scritto servisse per specificare questioni teologiche -diciamo così -in seno alla comunità dei credenti ( di cui io non faccio parte) allora, il discorso è diverso, e non posso entrare nel merito per ovvie ragioni.<br>  saluti.<br>  <br>  p.S: Noto con dispiacere che è tornato il solito idiota che scrive bestemmie..<br>  Se credessi in dio, direi che quando dio ha distribuito l'intelligenza agli uomini, evidentemente ha scambiato capo svastiche per un batterio..<br>  <br>  Caro Stefano, dal mio punto di vista la Madonna è un quid di divino per un cristiano; infatti viene venerata, e non tutte le donne hanno tale sorte. Quindi è evidente che non sia -per un cristiano - una donna come le altre. la differenza poi tra "adorare" è "venerare" è molto sottile, e comunque questi due verbi sottintendono un concetto religioso, un'idea di fede..se un credente non attribuisse un quid di divino alla Madonna, non l'adorerebbe, o non la venererebbe..mi sembra chiaro. <br>  Per me che sono ateo, la Madonna è una donna come tutte le  altre; per chi crede -al di là delle parole, se debba essere venerata o adorata - evidentemente, non è così.<br>  Saluti di nuovo.<br>  <br>  E noto con piacere che l'imbecille è scomparso,almeno dalla tua domanda..<br>  <br>  Ti consiglierei se permetti di non prendertela con lui più di tanto; non perchè tu sia cristiano, ma perchè tu -a differenza di lui -sei intelligente. <br>  <br>  Compatiscilo. fa pena, in fondo..mostra solo quanto sia idiota.|`|cXRzO28Raa	Gesù non è Dio perchè è stato un uomo come tutti noi, certo un rivoluzionario (come Gandhi del resto), ma sempre un essere umano. <br>  La differenza tra chi crede che Gesù sia Dio e chi no sta tutta nel credere alla sua resurrezione.<br>  Io non ritengo la resurrezione una cosa veritiera e di conseguenza rifiuto di riconoscere in un essere umano il mio Dio.<br>  La trinità è una contraddizione in termini, creata ad hoc e difesa nei secoli per non fare cadere in contraddizione il vecchio con il nuovo testamento.<br>  <br>  Ps: la religione a cui l'utente Camilla quì sopra si riferisce è il culto di Mitra, anche se dire che il cristianesimo è la riproposizione esatta di quel culto mi sembra un pò un azzardo...|`|fnYe0cpsaa	La divinità di Gesù è stata proclamata, se non sbaglio, in occasione del congresso di Nicea, quando sono state poste le basi della religione cristiana e dove si sono scelti i vangeli e i dogmi da propinare alle popolazioni che erano sotto l'influenza dell'impero romano, in modo da aumentare il potere ed il controllo delle popolazioni anche con il potere religioso.<br>  In realtà credere che Gesù sia o non sia figlio di dio e quindi che abbia o non abbia natura soprannaturale è solo questione di fede nella religione che lo afferma. Dal crederlo o dal negarlo poi discendono tutte le altre credenze legate alla sua figura che può essere intesa semplicemente come profeta oppure come incarnazione del dio cristiano.<br>  Molti sono i concetti che si stanno modificando, uno dei quali è quello che la chiesa cristiana manteneva sulla testa degli ebrei, accusati di deicidio e maledetti ( oggi scomparso ), quando i responsabili della morte di Gesù furono i romani e, forse, quattro poveri cristi pagati dal clero dell'epoca perchè insistessero nel farlo condannare, dato che avevano paura delle sue parole.|`|jUZP2QZPaa	...........andiamo sempre sul difficile!!!<br>  posso confidarti che ci ho messo un pò (a suo tempo) a capire esattamente "la Trinità".........soprattutto l'affermazione delle "tre persone uguali e distinte".<br>  Non è un "argomento facile" !|`|5mZFqlr0aa	Gesù è Dio. Gesù e tutt'UNO con Dio .  Anche tutti noi siamo Dio ; nel senso che abbiamo il "potenziale" che ci unisce a Dio. Questo "potenziale" è la nostra anima che ci permetterà di essere tutt'UNO con Dio .

Potenzialmente siamo una "Ferrari"ma occorreranno studi ,ripetute prove, fino a quando il motore sarà montato e provato in tutte le sue parti, allora e solo allora, .....sentiremo la perfezione del "rombo" del motore......!   Gesù disse : - "Io e il Padre mio siamo Uno. Io sono il figlio di Dio, e voi ed io siamo fratelli. " Questo significa che anche noi siamo figli di Dio.

Il figlio sei tu...e' Gesu' che e' riuscito nella sua opera di completamento della Trinita'! certo che Gesu' e' Dio..ma lo e' sempre stato...e non solo lui! <br>  Vedi...i grandi sacerdoti hanno sempre parlato attraverso un linguaggio simbolico che andava interpretato: i semplici, gli ignoranti( a loro detta) non potevano entrare nei segreti di quel linguaggio e cosi' parlando in linguaggio simbolico, hanno impedito a tutti di entrare veramente nella verita' di cio' che siamo! cerca di guardare "oltre": il Vangelo di Tommaso  puo' aiutarti a vedere oltre...ma poi segui cio' che ti dice il cuore! perche' anche se Gesu' non fosse veramente come ce l'hanno dipinto, sicuramente aveva qualcosa di grande da dire a noi..e questo qualcosa di grande, se lo cerchi oltre delle verita' che ti annebbiano la vista, lo puoi trovare!
