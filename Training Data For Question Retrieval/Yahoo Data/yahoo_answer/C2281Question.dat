20090202130450AAmyzM8	Education & Reference;Special Education	Have you ever seen something like this happen before?	There's an NAS (National Autistic Society) for the THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT AUTISM website.  It's a video where it shows two altered versions (like an alternative ending / scene to a DVD).  The first shows what a normal individual would react, and the other on how an autistic individual might react.  These individuals are played by the same actor, and there are altered processes in a specific event.   It's set at a small platform at a train station, the train comes in, stops, and the railway agent (who resembles Dennis Franz from NYPD BLUE) notifies the people on the platform that they will be holding the trains due to a signal failure.  "Doors will open in a couple of minutes.", he says in his british accent.  A man with red hair and a beard, a green sweater, a back-pack, glasses, short, 40s struggles to get the door to the nearest train car open.  The agent walks over and says "Excuse me, sir!  I said it'd be a couple of minutes!".  The man says "WHAT?  Not again!", thinking it's absurd.  He backs away.   That's how a normal individual would react.      In the second version with the autistic personality of the same man with the read beard / hair and the grey sweater, the same process is done, until the man struggles to get the door to the nearest train car open.  This time, the man persistently struggles to open the door.  The agent continues to tell the man that the doors will open in a couple of minutes, but the man insists he needs to get on the train and continues to struggle with the door knobs.  He bangs on the windows.  The conductor tries to tell him about the policy, the man pays no attention and says "I need to get on this train!  I need to get this door open!  I have a valued ticket and I need to get on the train!" Suspicious of the man's behavior, the agent becomes more stern.  "Stop it, or you'll break it!", the agent orders aloud with full authority walking closer to the man, who swats his arm passed the agent's face.  The man becomes more anxious, the agent dispatches assistance.  Other people join in watching the man's suspicious antics , but are puzzled by his antics, and don't realize he's a person suffering from a serious mental disorder.  "I NEED TO GET ON THIS TRAIN!", the autistic man says growing more anxious.  Another agent in need of assistance arrives, ushers the people the back away, and tries to help the man.  The aut becomes seconds close to making a scene, and continues to bang on the doors.  The agents grab hold of his arms, but the man covers his ears, and begins panicking like a victim in distress "NO!  NO!  NO!".  The agents try to escort him out, but the man is recalcitrant and begins acting, moaning, panicking, and whining like a mental patient as his feet become limp.  He is dragged to be held by authorities as he continues to shoot out the unbearable noise of his panicking.        The tag shows that people with autism may find it difficult to deal with everyday situations.  An event as simple as a break in schedule can cause overwhelming panic and anxiety.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6G-OpGgo...

I always type "could have" (or "should have", etc) but I constantly see people online that type "could of".  I always took this to be either ignorance or a typo, until I started reading "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" by Ken Kesey.  He always types "could of".        It seems to me that people are typing "could've" as they hear it, so it ends up looking like "could of".  "Could of" doesn't seem to make much sense to me.  What do you think?      example:      "I could've had a V8!"   vs   "I could of had a V8!"

20090202173027AA2g8oi	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What college will I get into?	Worst case scenario, though very likely, I will end up with a 3.5 unweighted and 4.25 weighted gpa.        Sophomore year - 3 APs and 2 honors, Junior year - 6 APs.        I am also an editor for the newspaper, President of a club, and in top 5% of my school in California.        I will be applying to most of the UCs, Pepperdine, NYU, USC, Vanderbilt, and University of Washington.       I would like to apply to Stanford or some Ivys, but I don't think I can get in :/.        What do you think?        What will I get into, and are those colleges good?      ******I will be moving to Ohio, and going to a new school for Sr year, so I will be compared among that school instead of the one in CA.  My teachers say it will be a lot easier for me to get into a UC, since my  HS is really competetive, and everyone in my HS applies for UCs, but in Ohio, less people will, and the HS may not be as great.  Is this true?      Also, apparently if I only live in Ohio for 9 months, I will not be a resident, so I will be able to pay CA amt for tuition, right?      Bleh.     So much to think about.      Your help is really appreciated.       Thanks 8)

20090202173344AAI3UsL	Education & Reference;Other - Education	What should I do??????????	I'm in high school and am thinking of what to major in college. I really love art. I have taken studio in art, studio in drawing and painting and printmaking /scupture classes in school so far. Next year I plan to take advanced drawing and painting and a portfolio class or photo illustration and graphic design. I especially like sculpture ( working with clay)-but like everything. I'm pretty good, I think. :)  I've also asked my art teacher what career she thought would be a good career for me. She said something like textile designs and that it is so much more than just clothes.     So do you think I should major in art in college? I always hear people say that it is a mistake to major in art because there are not enough good jobs out there. Also, is it difficult to be an art major?   Any advice???

20090202181639AAT5xis	Education & Reference;Teaching	Was my ela teacher at fault here honestly??!!!?	Ok so 2 years ago when i was in the 9th grade i was trying really hard to pass school so i wouldn't have to go to summer school or get kept back. But i had ALOT of absence's so i had to make up all the work in all my classes that i had missed (including ELA) wich was never the less ALOT of work to do. But i still put a great deal of effort into doing as much as i could. But i honestly dont know if everything i had done for my make up work was correct or not. But other then that everything in my ELA class that i was doing at the same time as other students i was doing really good,always getting good grades on my tests and doing my home work good and all that. Even the make work i was getting back were showing that i was getting really good grades. And i even asked my ELA teacher b4 the grades came out what she thought i might get. And she told me probably a "B" or "C" wich might let me be able to pass. And right when she was giving us our grades for the last semester i had really thought i had done all my make up work cause she never told me i had anymore. Then i see that i got an "F"!!!. On my report card not even a D or something. And i confronted her about that. And she told me "Oh well, you didnt do all ur make up work thats why". And you didnt get everything correct on your make up work as well. But i told her then if i did have more work left y didnt u tell me i did and why were u saying i was going to get good grades b4 u gave me my report card,and y did u give me good grades on all my makeup work if i didnt get them all "correct"?. She didnt say nothing and just got defensive and thought i was getting to upset?. and because of her i had to go to summer school and even my teacher in summer school said u got the highest score on ur ELA exam so y are u here?. lol so was what she did right or wrong??? please be honest...   Because that 2 face bitc* really ****** up my school life,and the screwed up part is that my mom believes the teacher over me no matter what i say!!.      Yeah and i pretty much had to repeat my ELA class again because of her!

I've questioned each of them, but I'm still none the wiser. Branson, the butler, said that Smythe, the gardener did it, while Mary, the maid, said Smythe had told her Branson did it. Smythe told me Branson did it, and Wilson, the handyman, said he knew which one was the thief but he did not wish to say." Lady Ashton sighed, then continued, "I've known Branson and Smythe for many years and I've never known either of them to tell the truth."   Sherlock Holmes smiled as he filled his pipe. "Assuming that the butler and the gardener have not changed their ways, and that Mary and Wilson are telling the truth, it is quite a simple task to deduce which one of them is the thief," said Holmes.      Can you work out which one of the staff stole the bracelet?

20090202180409AA4zhNr	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Is this a decent essay?	My bedroom. A place that is all my own, I share it with no one.  The walls are plain, the carpet is plain, the closet doors, the window and bed are all plain. My handmade wood bed. Has held me ever since I was a child. Made by my “paw-paw”.  My warm welcoming quilts made for me by my “maw-maw”.    The closet is full of clothes. Shirts of blues, pinks, and greens. Skirts and dresses for church.  Jeans and t-shirts for my “lazy days” The top is filled with Cabbage patch dolls one of my few collections. The bottom filled with all the many odds and ends of my life.   A computer desk holds my school papers from years past. Books, my love. Not only does the desk hold the books its holds the door to many opportunities reading has in store.  The wall behind the desk yet directly across from my bed is full of the wonderful world of twilight. Posters of the accident. Quotes and the many magazines in which twilight as an article or two.    The wall adjacent to that is lined with all my shoes. All thirty-six pairs. Blacks, whites, blues, browns, and pinks. Just to name a few of the colors of shoes I own. The line of shoes then leads to my bed. My bed is the most comfortable in the house. Its firm yet soft. Piles of pillows and mountains of quilts. All the items a bed needs.    Under this bed are “monsters” some bad memories of school years past. But yet somehow the memories of those years are some of my very best ones. I place the papers there to remind me that in my room I am the one that decides how things are going to be.  That I am free to let go of everything. In my room I don’t have to hold in all my anger and frustrations. I can let of these feelings of madness and chagrin.    My room is my favorite place because it is all my own, I share it with no one. I make the rules and I hold the key to what happens there.    .          i wrote this for school. Is this a desent paper? if not maybe some ideas or tips to make it better?
20090202180431AAPtLyQ	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	College is expensive. Can anyone help me afford to pay for college so i can have a decent education?	My name is Austin H and I am from MN. I am enrolled at a small college in Northern Wyoming. I have been looking for a job but this town is too small and the next town over is 30 miles. Since I am an out of state college student I cant afford to drive 30 miles one way. That is way too much time. I have applied everywhere in the 2000 person town. The Golden Arch wont even take me. I need to make money for my tuition. As of right now I vacuum for my dorm. Nothing special. I only get 7.75 an hour for 40 hrs a month. Thats only 300 bucks a month. I cant live off of that. I have to pay my tuition. I dont even have 2000 dollars. I just spent money on my cars tires so i could go home for Christmas. So i guess i should jump to the point. I am wondering if anyone out there is generous to donate 1000 dollars to a probable cause. I need an education and dropping out does not seem like the way to go. I cant take out a lone because i already have 2 out and my parents dont have money because my dad is out of work. The economy is falling apart and all I want to do is go to school. Is there someone out there that would help me?
20090202180609AAWVAKm	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Why do we learn the things we do in school, when most of it is not even used in life or will just be forgotten?	Most of the things I'm learning and have been learning will be forgotten and completely useless out of college... so why even learn them? For example...in algebra, these complex mathematical equations you'd only need to know as a math professor? And in chemistry, stoicheometry to find how many moles of a substance are in a certain compound?? All this stuff will just be forgotten or remain unused, so why learn them when we can spend time relearning more important things we've forgotten? I can understand learning some of this stuff for training to be, say, a scientist or such. But there are more jobs where you don't need to know stoicheometry than jobs you do need to know it. Please...enlighten me.

20090202190052AAw1Q6o	Education & Reference;Special Education	Is my son Dyslexic? When and where can I get him tested?	I am going to try and get my son tested. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with it.      He is in Pre K and is almost 5. They have been working on writing their names for the last 5 months or so. He consistently writes his S backwards. His name is Bryson. (they write it just as I've written it, Capital B, the rest lowercase).   He also attempts to write it as nosyBr instead.      I decided to give him a little test of my own. I attempted to get him to write a 9.. he wrote a P. I tried to get him to write a d... he wrote a P. I tried a b and again he wrote a P and I tried P and he finally got it right with a P. I know it sounds like he writes everything as a P but he doesn't. I was able to get him to write EAT and Book. So he can write more than just P's. He also writes 3's backwards and n's as u's sometimes as well.  Oh and ALWAYS writes his S's backwards. We've done test after test, trace after trace and he still will consistently write his S's either backwards or sideways (yes, sideways)         I don't just ask him to write them either. I show him an example and ask him to write it down right next to the example.   I even wrote him an E and he told me it was a 3.         I know he is young to be diagnosed but I really think he has this learning disorder and I know that early diagnosis is the key to his success in life.         Any suggestions or advice would be great. Should we pull him from his Pre K and put him in a program that has more experience dealing with it?

My daughter just switched to Health Class for the new semester (12 years old, 7th grade, NYS public middle school).  Today they met the teacher for the first time.  She introduced herself as Dr. Whomever, told them that she'd be their teacher for their unit of Health, and would like to tell them a bit about herself.  She proceeded to say, first thing, that she is a lesbian.  My daughter was a bit shocked that a teacher would share this about herself as an introduction.       Now, I get that it's Health Class and they'll be discussing sexuality.  I get that maybe she wants everyone to feel comfortable talking about themselves.  We do live in a very open community and the culture here is more relaxed than other communities.  HOWEVER, this is a 7th grade class in a public middle school.      Do you think it's acceptable/appropriate for a teacher to announce their sexual preference to students?  I need some other perspectives.      I'm curious to know as well if there are any specific guidelines or laws regarding the sharing of teachers' personal information with students.      Thanks in advance.

20090202191544AAxALH2	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Is joining the ARMY a good option for those who have no way of paying college tuition?	I'm currently a high school senior and I've been stressing about my post high school plans. I really want to become a pharmacist, but 7-8 years of college is a lot of dough.     At first, I thought I was going to be able to go to a university. I got accepted into Washington State U and I am pending a response from the University of Washington. However, I recently found out that I do not qualify for federal financial aid; therefore leaving me no way to go to a university, especially for 7-8 years.    So, I pondered the option of community college. Yes it is a lot cheaper, but I believe that I will still struggle to pay off the remaining 5-6 years of schooling I wish to partake in.    The idea of joining the armed services recently popped up in my mind. I was wondering if one would recommend for someone in my situation to join the armed services? How long does one typically serve? Will it pay off pharmacy school after I receive my Bachelor's?

20090202124714AAiuKaE	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Do you think this is unfair?	My class got back their big research papers today and I am ticked off. I wasted pretty much all of Christmas Break working on it and for all my hard work I got a 75%. Not to sound conceited or anything but I am one of the smartest people in my class (Although to be honest, in my class that wouldn't take much). I am in the 8th Grade, and we had to do these same papers for the 7th and 6th Grades and I got over a 100% each time, so I don't know what went wrong.       But the reason I am ticked off is because I know for a fact that many of my classmates simply copied and pasted their whole 4-Page paper off of websites like Wikipedia so they could enjoy their break more. And guess what, everyone that I know of who copied and pasted their paper got an A. I even overhead someone saying our teacher was so stupid for not noticing that he just copied his whole paper off of Wikipedia. How unfair is it that they all get A's for 2 seconds of dishonest work while I get screwed over with a D after slaving over my paper for 15 days during Christmas break!

Thousands of People Crowded around in the parking lot waiting to see Slipknot live in concert. Almost Everyone around is in all black with tight black jeans or trip pants and Slipknot shirts. There were even some trench coats here and there. Some people had Slipknot masks. Probably from Their Favorite member from Slipknot. There Where metal detectors in front of the doors and Guards looking for anything that could possibly hurt someone because the mosh pits get pretty crazy. Anything dangerous you have on you you have to leave outside and most cameras too. That’s why it’s good to watch what you have on you so you don’t get something important taken away from you. When you make it inside there are stands where you can buy concert shirts and hoodies usually there are places to buy drinks or snacks but if you’re going to be in the pit it’s not a good idea to buy drinks because there’s no where to put them.    People are running around the halls trying to find the door to go in closest to their seats because it’s getting time for slipknot. Finally the halls are just about clear as people start heading into the auditorium. Inside the auditorium it’s just about pitch black except for the lights on the stairs and all you can hear is the screams for slipknot from the dub maggots. All of a sudden Fire shoots from the stage and Corey Taylor the lead singer of Slipknot Screams ARE YOU READY! And the dub maggots Start screaming even louder than before. Slipknot starts playing there new song psychosocial from their new album “all hope is gone” so loud a deaf man could hear it. Everyone In the pit starts running around punching and smashing into one another so hard you could hear their bodies bouncing off each other. If you don’t like getting punched in the face that’s not the place to be but who doesn’t like that.    On Stage Paul Gray is jumping around with his bass running from one side of the stage to the other along with Mick Thomson and James Root on Guitar, and Joey Jordison and Shawn Crahan ,also known as Clown, are beating on their drums and rocking around on them making the crowd go crazy which is what makes there shows so amazing because they are so full of energy and never stay still for too long. All the members of slipknot have on black jumpsuits with the Slipknot symbol on the sleeve and of course there very new mask that are sick as always. My favorite mask is the clown’s mask because his are always creepy looking and usually have some blood.   The concert lasted for about a hour closing with my favorite song Wait and Bleed Which is also the song that won them there first award so it was the perfect song to end with.

Problem is no one is hiring around my location and if they are they're hours aren't flexible enough to allow me to go to school.

I would like to see my son in a good group home or assisted living that would help him get his ged and a job, a start in life now that he is ready for that and very stable on meds. He is 28 and is very smart and ambitious. He stays at a small assisted living now just thru the week, but it offers nothing. I would really apprechiate some help or how to look this up. He does have a guy helping him some but only a few hours a week. thanks!

20090202192457AAzseFE	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What is your opinion about these subjects?	I am posting this for two reasons. One: to state my opinion, and Two: to know yours.      God: I think god is completely made up. I don't know when or why people did, but I'm sure gods where created to answer all the questions we can't. No one can watch everyone. Hog-wash.      Ghost/Spirits: They don't exist either. When a mouse dies, where does it go? No where. When a human dies? Where does it go? No where. There is no such thing as hell, or heaven.       Aliens: It's very foolish to think that in a never ending universe we  are the only life. I think the chances of other life it very high. I think it's just very tiny, like germs, and they don't invade us. I think it's possible for species to be like us, be smart, build stuff, go to space, ect. but earth is such a rare planet, the chances of a whole different alien species being real, and being hostile, and be able to come here is astronomical. The earth, it's life, it's atmosphere- all so rare. There is probably nothing else like it ANYWHERE.       World ending..?: The world will not end in 2012. The only good excuse it some god told the Mayan's. Which is not possible. How can a bunch of smelly people, that do not even know what soap is, know when the world is going to end. If the world does end, it will be due to Something from space, like a metior or a ALIEN INVASION!! But I don't think that's going to happen. That's just my first guess if it does.       What's your opinion? Pick all or one of these and tell me what YOU think. Please answer, I didn't type that short novel for nothing. if you think I'm wrong, tell me why you think you're right. =]

20090202191910AATSOnE	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Is High School basically a daycare?	After attending high school and looking back at it seems like a waste of my life. We are told, we live in a free country. But ever since you are 5 you are being cultivated and raised to join the system. By the time we are 14, we have the ability to read, write, and perform simple algebra. Then I believe the next phase of our life should begin. Whether it be bull**** college, blue collar work, or my personal favorite beating the system for money.  I don't think it is simply coincidence high school  takes place generally 8-3. Which seems to be very similar to that of their parents work day. One who attends night school (3 hours a day) or drops out and opts to get their ged, can still attend college. Potentially get the same job as one who went to all four years of challenging, full time high school. Is this just a huge scam to keep kids out of trouble?

20090202192345AAjta1X	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Talking to parents about failed course in high school.?	I recently failed my accounting class in high school. I took it because I though it would be fun and easy, it was but boring not your regular boring guys and girls real boring.       The good news is the way my school is set up there are four years in the school (grade 9-12) and by the end of grade 12 you should have 2 spares if you pass all your courses. I have failed math last year but got it back in the summer. So I have 2 "spares" still which I can take another course in grade 12. (I am in grade 11)       More good news is that I do not need to take that particular class again as it is a "optional class", so basically I can take another class of my choice.      I need a way of explaining it to them perfectly or almost perfectly because they jump to conclusions very quickly and get very mad VERY quickly and if your a teen too you know what I mean.
