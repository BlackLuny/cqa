Was in subway last week and there was a little card on the counter advertising an online weight loss tracker, that for every pound you lose they donate money to help feed the hungry...or something along those lines.      Don't think it was done by subway, they were just promoting it      Didn't write it down and figured I could just google it but I can't find it.      Anyone know about this program and/or where the website is?
