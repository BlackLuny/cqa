I was cleaning house all day (without her even asking), and then she kept saying i wasn't doing it right. So I told her that i was just going to do it my way, and if she wanted she couldd do it her way later. She left and then came back and was spazzing out on me saying i missed a spot, yelling and calling me a little *****.      Now I can't do anything until we're on the same page, and i admit what I did wrong. what does she want me to say/what should i?

20090227084433AA0EvrW	Social Science;Psychology	Is my life a loser's life?	I'm not actively involved in schooling bc they kicked me off campus and restricted me to online courses. My offense? constantly cursing out ppl and punching/throwing stuff. A girl I wanna be friends with didn't wanna talk to me so I unleashed my wrath on everyone and everything until they finally had to call security on me in the library.       I also just lost my job bc I got nasty and sarcastic with a coworker who pissed me off and I banged my head against the fitting room pole in front of customers a few days later. The first incident, they coulda let me go, but they just gave me an informal warning w/o any documentation. The second incident, customer and her child reported me. I banged my head bc coworker didn't admit she's wrong. Now, I'm pretty much isolated and have difficulty finding another job (bc I have to tell the truth on my application) and getting back on campus (bc I'm permently kicked off). Am I a loser?      It's such a shame bc I was making good grades at school and was productive as hell at my job. Plus the perfect attendance crap, I got that going for me. I do everything right and I'm still a loser? I used to hang around friends all the time to the point that my parents waived curfew. Now I've lost some of them bc I blow up at them. They just won't accept my apology and my explanation that something else pissed me off and I was taking it out on them.      Basically, I've lost everything.

Negative opinions and ideas always seem to attract a lot more followers than positive ones.       For instance, at your workplace: have you ever stopped to notice how much negativity floats around you every day? This seems to be true in my case, at least.      People seem to think that complaining (even about GOOD things!) is the way to go. Somehow most of us find negative thinking and/or speaking a form of endearing us to everyone else.      Don't you agree?      How much negativity in any format are you willing and able to digest every day, really?      Me? Not much, I'll tell you. Not much at all. I am always trying to protect myself in any way possible against other people's dark energy...

I spent a few day last week with my ex-fiance and our son and I was able to acknowledge that I still have very strong feelings for him. Since our relationship came to an abrupt halt he has moved on, and now has a child with another young lady. I feel like I am being selfish and childish but, I can't make sense of this situation and I've been doing a lot of crying lately. They aren't the happiest couple they fight and argue constantly. We never used to argue. She doesn't have much going for herself no education, no looks and an extremely nasty attitude but, she's loyal, kind of like a thankful stray dog that's been fed. I try to accept the situation but, it hurts everyday emotionally but, some days physically I ache. I can't keep being this way. It's not fair to my son for me to have to force smiles, and wipe away tears before he sees, he deserves a Mommy that is genuinely happy. Please if anyone knows of a good book that could help me through this situation I would be very thankful. If the whole book thing doesn't work out I'll probably just go to counseling or something. I can't keep being this way.

I had to take care  of some business yesterday, where I went you usually would see these ppl coming off a sarcastic but it was this lady She was super nice, I mean so nice where I ask for a hug after the end of the meeting. It was weird I wonder how many others ask her. Anyway I just felt so good. I later met a friend that new my deadbeat dad he called my deadbeat up. I played cool told him Im doing great, and gave my friend back the phone, wasn't mad,upset anything just let bygones be bygones. That lady had me like that.       Then I get home and it's this young man live in my building we stop and chat for a while, we always hug when we see each other but his hugs are always like he really needed them badly(Im like that too) but he just so excited.

20090307165048AAD5X0T	Social Science;Psychology	What are the thoughts in my head?	I wish I knew how to read minds. There is this lovely woman(girl) I see at the therapist consultation building I go to every week. She is so so pretty, my eyes almost fell off. She seems to already know I like her, but she acts like she doesn't. My annoying sister told her that I like her. She likes me too but we don't see each other much, we only seem to stare at each other while she is on her desk receiving phone calls and I am just sitting within the people waiting area. Funny thing is, she is just the secretary up front who attends incoming patients to sign in and signing out. I am simply a patient who happens to go there and not much else. Seeing her is about the most exciting thing to see whenever I come and see my therapist, sure she attracts me to no end, but seeing her is the best part of my day. All I know is that her name is Anadia and, well,... she knows my name because of me signing in and signing out. Also, I call her a woman because of her proper job, but really she is a young young girl about the age of 20 and 23. My heart melts for her. I know what a guy needs to do if they like someone, but look at the situation here. I am a patient and she is the secretary who works there. Is this kind of relationship out of the ordinary, or is it beautiful? I was wondering about what kind of tips or advice you can give me.

20090307170352AAtlxsr	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Lucid (or partly so) dream, chose to stay in bad dream? Asking again because I didnt get ANY answers earlier.?	Its not unusual for me to have lucid dreams. Also, most of my dreams (with an exception once every few months) are bad. I have developed something that allows me to escape he bad dream, just something I taught myself to do overtime.   Well, with all that said, last night I was dreaming I was alone in a parking lot, I had a bit of a walk to get to my car. I saw a car full of guys, they drover a bit passed me and stopped their car and it seemed they were going t reverse and right then and there I knew they wanted to hurt me. For a micro second I realized I was dreaming and was about to do my "escape" but as I was I decided I wanted to stay in the dream but I still ran but for a VERY short time, than I decided to stop, I lied on a hill and saw them comes towards me, I didnt run, I just didnt have the fight in me. I did say I would do anything but pleas dont hurt me. I was raped by all of them but not very violently.   Anyway, Im good at interpreting my on dreams but the idea that I knew I was dreaming,considered escaping yet decided to stay and surrender to the dream. Why??   I dont expect you to know the facts, just your opinion is fine.

My dream was so vivd, I could have sworn it was real!      We were somewhere with dim lighting, like a closet or in a car. And I was up against his neck. It was just us two and a big huge mass of kisses. I don't know who was kissing who or where, but I was obsessed with my lips on his neck. It was so soft! Ha, and it was really hot and cold. Felt good :) We were breathing really hard and everything, and my hands never left him. The whole time I was just thinking about kissing him and how crazy this was.       The emotions and physical contact were very present and strong. I really thought it was happening.       I probably wouldn't have been thinking about it much, except that before me and my ex started going out I dreamt he came to my house and while I was laying down he came up and kissed me on the forehead. I felt that, too! Only it was more innocent, and his kiss was cold and wet and innocent. Not like this one. At all. Lol         Should I take it as just a dream/desire (Although I don't really like him anymore) or take it as a sign for something?>            Thanks in advance!

20090307165544AAOoDA5	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Would this site be offensive?	(This is an offshoot to a previous question I asked)      Would this site ( www.femmefatalities.com ) be offensive if it were about Blacks or gays being killed?       excerpt:   "Our famous reviewers bring you the very best in sex and violence in cinema in these insightful and thought-provoking reviews! "       (It's a site devoted to films where beautiful women are killed.)       Does society have different standards for race, sexual identity, gender?       What is the difference between censoring something (which this site is not) and considering something offensive and unacceptable?       Why is child pornography not considered censorship? Can we censor things for some groups but not others? How can some forms of censorship be allowed and not others? Where do we draw the line and who gets to decide?
20090307160921AAzPK5z	Social Science;Psychology	Alcoholism and Alcoholics?	Could you help, I think my dad might be an alcoholic. I'm not really sure, but after reading about it i don't know if he is. He does drink almost every night at home, i'm not sure how many of those times he gets drunk. I do know that he has only driven home once after drinking. He has never gotten in trouble with the law by drinking. And he has NEVER been abusive (verbal and physical) and hasn't gotten violent with anyone. I also wanted to know if i might be part of the problem as to why he drinks so much. Sometimes i give him a hard time and don't listen. Can you help?      Thanks.

20090307170825AAVvQ1j	Social Science;Psychology	What are the circumstances under which I can be forcefully admitted into temporary psychiatric care?	I've been seeing a therapist on my university campus for about 5 months. One of the things he asked when we started was whether I had any suicidal thoughts. It was my impression that as long as I was deemed to be no threat to myself or others, everything said in our sessions would remain confidential.      Things have changed and in spite of the medication they have me on, I've become what I'd call "less stable" in the past couple of weeks. I feel more hopeless and sometimes wish I just simply died.      My question is, can my counselor force me into a hospital or something if I were to disclose these changes in my emotional stability with him? I am an adult. I live in Texas. What are the circumstances under which I can be forcefully admitted into temporary psychiatric care against my will?

20090307163105AAEBAX0	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Weird, Crazy Dream. What does that mean?	I had a dream last night that I was kidnapped from a strange man. I don't know what I was doing or how I got there,in a basement that was dark and I was sweating like crazy. I had a washcloth tied around my mouth, too. My love interest was a dude that I know, but I don't like him in real life, and he was worried and concerned for me. I found a way out of the house and ran across the street to some apartment buildings and knocked on the first door I saw. I asked to used the phone and called 911. The police and the ambulance came, along with my love interest and we kissed passingly. Now in real life this dude isn't so passionate. Why did I dream I was being kidnapped and why was this dude my love interest?

I walked past it didn't mind it. I then turned around and saw it/looked at it again, and threw a rock into hole....nothing came out. then a gold/brown spotted snake darted out EXTREMELY quickly in a big tangle and was slithering around in a giant mess like a big ball....and i had no idea where its head was....and out of nowhere its head darted out at me and its jaws were GAPING and the fangs were so detailed...i mean everything was so vivid....its face/head everything...and then when its head darted for me, it went towards my mid-section with its jaws gaping like I said...then in an instant i went for its neck with left hand, and the INSTANT i caught it by its neck, i woke up and believe it or not, i was grabbing my penis.. i had shorts and boxers on btw...i reached through somehow and right when i grabbed the snakes neck in my dream, i woke up, my heart was pounding, and i had my penis in hand, because thats where its gaping jaws were headed...what does this mean??      thanks!

20090307173440AA9mXRt	Social Science;Psychology	What would jesus [you] do?	um ok. so i'm a sophomore in high school and i take gym class.      and our coach has been teaching us about volleyball.   and the other day we had to get in a circle and like   pass the ball around eachother.   me and my friend went into a group of boys, cause   a idiot asked her too. so i joined too.    and when we were passing it around, i kept missing    it cause im not really that good.   and this idiot kept on telling me to put more effort into it   and i have. he kept on repeating it and repeating it.   i didnt really say anything, but it was getting on my nerves.   then he was like "you should put more effort into it"   and i was like " i am! dont you see me hitting the ball?"   and he was imitating how i last hitted the one. and said "thats not trying"   and i was like whatever. and i was smiling in my head.   but the more i thought about it the more i got mad.   i was like wth, i didnt even do anything to him and he kept on   picking on me out of the whole group. i wanted to cuss him   out so bad, but i didnt.   then the next day, we had to practice serving.   i got into the same group again, and i asked him for the ball and he    heard me but he would serve it then give it to me. i was like wtf. i didnt really say anything though. then when my friend from another class came over to ask me something, thats when he decided to throw it to me off guard. i was like oh hell no. he turned around and i threw it at his back. and i saw him trying to throw it back at me but didnt.       well my question is, what would you do? i'm not the kind of person who lets others step on me. i wanted to hit him so hard, but im not a violent person either. i want revenge. if you read this and think its stupid, i guess you had to be there to see it.    and i think he only acted this way is cause he likes my friend. and at the beginning i guess he only wanted her to be in our group but i came along too. but thats fcked up cause i didnt do anything to him and he's not the effing leader! ugh.
