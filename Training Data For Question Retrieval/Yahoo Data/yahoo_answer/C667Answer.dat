I don't know why you agreed to date this guy, let alone marry him!  he's a deadbeat and he's USING  you!  don't you see that?  quit him asap.|`|AA10975867	You didn't need to say anything past the title : you don't trust your fiance. Period. Dump him. Go talk to a legal aid lawyer and get the ownership/investment of your home clear. If you have proof (bank records) that you've been making the payments and providing the only regular income, you can change the locks on the door, put his clothes on the curb and say "Hasta la vista, baby". I truly don't understand why women put up with this kind of crap. You hang around, setting a bad example for your children, hurting yourself, losing your self-respect, missing out on meeting good men - what for? Because of a few bucks invested in THINGS?|`|AA11138696	So why would you still want to be with him.  He has proved that he is weak and immature and that he is not going to change.  You are the one making the money so why are you stuck.  He is not helping you so you could easily make it on your own, you are already doing that only you are also supporting him.  Drop those pounds of ugly useless fat and kick him to the curb.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	If you know he is lying and think he is cheating on you. Then kick him out of the house. Break if off with him. If you are the only one working to have all your money tied into your home. Then you do not need him around to help pay for that home to continue to live there without him.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Trust is one of the most important elements of a healthy successful relationship.  Without trust you have nothing.  If you really can not trust him you need to let him go.  It will be hard, but you will thank yourself for it later.|`|JtJxVBOsaa	Nothing is going to get better. Your man isn't bringing anything into the relationship, and that's not going to improve. Unless you want to be saddled with his gambling habit, and the worry of whether or not he is where he says he is, it's time to let things go. It's better to end it now than get a divorce later. If you don't trust him now, how will that change later?|`|blXMfxRsaa	Boot him out. He is just going to keep bringing you down. It doesn't sound like you love him anymore and he doesn't treat you right and he can't be trusted. Trust is one of the most important parts of a relationship. Thing will more than likely be getting worse, the best thing you can do is get out of this relationship for your sake an your sons.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	You shouldnt marrry him if you dont trust him, even if you love someone its never good to marry without trusting them cause it is a major factor when you marry.|`|afI03mJXaa	Wow this is a difficult situation. You shouldn't be marrying someone you don't trust. He obviously has a gambling problem which isn't good for your future. It is good that he knows he has a problem, but unless he is getting actual help for it, it will continue to be a problem. So I would say if you really love him and he really loves you then you two should get help to try and fix this problem before you get married. Don't forget that people do have problems, but they can be fixed as long as that person is willing to work on it. Don't give up on anything until you know you have done everything you possibly could do and even at that you aren't giving up because you tried. Good Luck
LwywrSRkaa	Hi, consider yourself lucky! I am absolutely knackered and I just came out of bed. I would love to go somewhere, especially right now. See it as a break, take some light work with you and 5 days is seriously not gonna effect your revision badly. (12 May! Plenty of time. =D) Really! & If you are very worried just ask your teachers for the work they are planning to do in whatever days you're missing. Take any copies of coursework or whatever with you (never the real thing in case you lose it) and do those. Just have fun and maybe every night look through some notes. Have fun! =) =) =)|`|82A8E4yzaa	Its sorta the same with me : i am going away for 2 weeks in April to orlando and missing school . And GCSE's are coming round and loads of coursework to hand in.<br>  <br>  But i will bring the work i need to revise with me so i wouldn't slip behind. And working alittle harder that usual to make sure everything is in on time. <br>  <br>  I think you should go...as i always say : travelling broadens the mind , which is very true.<br>  <br>  Have a nice time!!|`|rlBkq8cpaa	chance of a life time. go for it!!!
uC55n3HIaa	WHAT? WOAH BACK IT UP! I just answered this question and I assumed he was already you're boyfriend. DO NOT LET HIM DO ANYTHING, even if you like him. He's just taking advantage of you. Do you want everyone in school to call you a cheap ****? For the sake of not becoming a social outcast. DON'T LET HIM TOUCH YOU. I would recommend you to like another guy, but hell, don't let him touch you to say the least.|`|WuwhfyT9aa	I don't know your age but sounds like it's your first time at such activities.  I think you might guess where it goes from here and undoubtedly that is something you will enjoy if the time is right. <br>  <br>  The time is right when you can handle it emotionally.  When if the relationship blows up after you will be alright and not hung up because you loved the guy and you gave yourself to him.  You need to get over that before you even go into this kind of relationship.<br>  <br>  Next is all that stuff they teach you in health class.  Get the birth control pills, make him wear a condom, do all of that.  Be careful with this stuff.  If the guy wants to put his hand down your pants then he's done it before.  STD is a problem, just make sure you have someone who will not be spreading it around as he spreads his love.
tCiVuFK9aa	Yes actually there are.  It is mostly for lonely older women and it is more popular in the European countries.  But they run the same risks that their female counterparts do.<br>  Red|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It happens all the time dude. I'm currently married but before settling down with my bride I dated quite a bit. One fine lady offered me an antique truck to be her exclusive "servant" for 6 months. I was seeing someone else at the time and turned it down. Damn what I would give now to have that truck.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Both Lucy's apparently aren't thinking about getting older. When this happened to me I was in my 50's as was she. At this point in life try walking into any bar and see what you get. Funny thing is this is when the guys can walk in. There's a lot less of us then than there are of you.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Ummmm.....I'm pretty sure 95% of the women in the world can walk in a bar and take some guy home to service them.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free?|`|CuGAYMlbaa	there is always a buyer|`|tA1ztvXaaa	Believe it or not I actually think that everyone is a gigolo in every relationship just to different degrees.  Let's think about it, most men buy woman or should I say MOST REAL MEN, give their women gifts, trinkets, money, take care of her for ultimately relationships, sex, attention.  As well as there are many women who do the same thing, I can assure you that MOST people will deny they do anything for money...realistically WE ALL do things for money and if not money some benefits.  I think unless you're married to man, who is taking care of his household or nowadays we have house husbands as well, i think we are all glorified escorts.  Whether we admit it or not.  I can assure you that had you asked who would go out with a man who had bad credit, no job, no car not home not love tool, or a woman who was toothless, ok maybe some freaky guys may see a perk in that but you get the point most people would say NO.  it's like TINA turner says "what's love got to do with it" fact is MONEY MONEY MONEY makes the world go round, love isn't paying the rent or putting food on the table or because you LOVE your job if yoru boss doesn't pay you. you wont mind...but hey this is just my opinion|`|4eLLjTzzaa	Sure there is!  And there are all kinds of services, too.  I knew a man who was a finance manager during the day and an "upstairs butler" in the evenings.  For a small "consideration" he would dust your house, vaccuum the floors, make the beds, etc, in nothing but an apron (your choice, btw).  Physical contact was not assumed in the contract, but could be negotiated.  I'd do that!  (I didn't hire him, lol, he was a friend.)|`|xGshAiXOaa	No.  If I wanted random sex I don't think I would have a problem getting it without having to pay.  That's one perk of being a woman; much easier to get laid than it is for a man.|`|8GyivEanaa	They have it in Amsterdam Holland male brothels and in Germany. How you think they came up wit the word gigolo, hustler male prostitute.|`|OBCvewW2aa	There's no market.<br>  <br>  Move along citizen.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	Oh, I'm sure there are women out there who do pay $$$ to receive "male services", but it's just not for me.

XjBKV2ohaa	You don't say your age, so I don't know if you still need to follow your mom's instruction to stay away from him.  The rest of my reply assumes that is no longer a consideration.  (If you are under 18, and your mom still wants you to stay away from him, then by all means, stay away from him!)<br>  <br>  You and he share something very unpleasant between yourselves.  Since your mom discovered what he was doing with you, that brought the matter to light, and it was undoubtedly very uncomfortable for him to deal with at the time.  Your childhood relationship was damaged by the activities he led you into.<br>  <br>  Now it is probably impossible for him to think about you without subconsciously bringing back those unpleasant memories.  Maybe he's feeling some guilt and shame.<br>  <br>  I understand your desire to have an older brother figure in your life, but he might not be ready to be that person for you.
zbFJpyMyaa	Been there and felt that. Hoenstly, you might find it less stressful to keep stuff to yourself than explaining that to her. My folks thought the same about me, but when I quit blabbing about the stuff I "wanted" or "Dreamed" about, then they quit bugging me about it. Sorry if that's not much help. Personally, when someone tells me that, I make a list of ten things I've bought recently and ask myself why. Usually, it's clothes or food and then I ask a few more questions beyond "why" and I quit buying stuff for a bit.|`|VJhZe9VBaa	do what you do. be yourself<br>  talk to someone about it. let it all out|`|tIoeOgJ4aa	I would tell her that what we don't like in others, we don't like in ourselves.  So maybe she is the one being materialistic?
RgAVm7zCaa	Oh my, that's seems like such an immature thing for him to do, and mean too! You should tell him that it is really none of his business what your exact grades are. That you would tell him if you were failing, but you aren't. Maybe you could work something out like you tell him the letter grades but not the exact number or something. I don't know. That is SUCH a stupid thing to get mad over. I am really sorry your boyfriend is mean to you!<br>  <br>  xx-Shelby|`|LLeQyWGcaa	young love fighting over stupid stuff. isn't you telling him your grades good enough for him, or does he just want to make a liar out of you. this is a stupid reason not to be talking to each other. you both need to grow up some i think!!!!|`|veZLfnGFaa	Leave him alone.

Are you not sharing what you're getting for grades? Or not being honest about it? If not then why the hell should he care.  What difference will it make if he see them, so he can bug you to do better when you're not doing so hot? I'm not quite understanding this one.l|`|t81MEJ82aa	Another wonderful question where the ladies are giving balanced unbiased answers. Why should you be ashamed of your grades as if he is some random person off the street? I do think his reaction is extreme unless he is helping you finance this degree or invested a lot in helping you in some other way. But perhaps there is something else going on that you are failing to mention.<br>  <br>  What ultimatum are you talking about?|`|wHDxWWhraa	look i dont know the whole situation....about you and about him ...<br>  so i dont have solution to the whole problem....but i have an idea...since you've been having a routine to phone him (and he don't reply) STOP DOING IT,stop making phones to him,ok it is hard i understand but just do it,believe me you'll have his attention for a while..and try to fix this in the adults way...talk to him...and make an agreement on what you want from him ,and what he want from you...this will help.....<br>  to me, both of your actions were silly....no meaning to not giving him info! what will happen if he knows....you said it is "more valid relationship than i feel fits in "singles and dating"!! ".....so he is the only person that MUST know everything happening to you........<br>  on the other hand his reaction is not understandable....how can you cut a wonderful relation with you best match just because she didn't tell you an info...ok it is mistake you made, since you made him feel that you don't trust him completly...but his reaction must be to tell you that it hurts and he is not happy about it....thats all.......!|`|1fa1d82a6a831651d482ff85ed3b01dfaa	If your boyfriend loves you he will understand your plight at college especially if you are having a ADD problem. You need to ask yourself why you don't want him seeing them. Are you embarrassed? He is feeling like you don't trust him to know and after 6 years, You should be able to trust him with anything. If you can't trust him, you shouldn't be with him.|`|pxygDg7Aaa	This is in the "marriage & divorce" category. Go away.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	He is being entirely unreasonable. Under no circumstances should you give someone personal log-in information. You are not married to him and that is dangerous behavior. <br>  <br>  I think you know already that this is not the right guy for you, otherwise you wouldn't feel so fearful of being judged about your grade. I'm sorry it's causing you anxiety, but it's a pretty clear indication that this relationship should be over.|`|chENztVEaa	I don't see what is the issue if he is your long term boyfriend.  I don't think what he is doing is right either.  Maybe he feels you are not open with him ( not dishonest, just not open with personal issues ).  You have the right ot your privacy though if you don't feel like sharing this info to anyone.  I do think you both need to ask yourselves if this is worth the fight.
No3wL14Yaa	I can see how you would be hurt, seems like she is just using you for the money and i think that you shouldnt give in to anymore. You really put a lot of thought into that v-day present and she wanted the money. Save yourself the stress and money and stop footing her bills.|`|xWtW2kHraa	You are 18. I am 41. Son, learn the lesson NOW: dump this gal and stop buying things for those who do not appreciate your generosity. The simple fact that she wishes to return the shoes NOT for the correct size but for spending money says it all!!! Its years of experience with women that tells me this. I also fortunate to know men of integrity and discernment. Become that man today and share your power with others.<br>  <br>  This is age-old advise here. Trust it and learn from it without having to go thru even more expensive lessons like this in the future!!  If you don't, women will use your generosity and mistake it for weakness, which in fact it kind of is. Choose carefully who you give to but never stop giving to those in need or to those who truly appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|I7zocOEnaa	I under-stand You feel hurt and maybe a little depressed <br>  <br>  you could tell her saying it upfront <br>  "It really hurt what you told me the other day about returning the shoes.." <br>  "And I just wanted to say that" <br>  <br>  that way you at least have the feeling that you got that off your mind <br>  stop stressing over it.

If she thinks you're hot then she might say yes. If she doesn't accept then you basically have no chance. If, however, you actually want something more than a night of hot kinky sex with this girl then you have to get to know her before you tell her how sexy she is.

b2991299e50178a6760fb54b34c39b27aa	No, the marriage will not "legalize" the status of an illegal immigrant.  The most reliable thing to do is to quietly go to your fiance's home country and get married there.  Then go to the U.S. Embassy and <br>  apply for an "immigrant spouse visa".

It takes a long time and is expensive.|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Illegal or legal immigrant after marriage to US citizen is entitled to obtain Green Card (immigration visa). Obtaining a Green Card through marriage can be complicated. Each year over 450,000 thousand United States citizens marry foreign-born individuals and petition for them to obtain permanent residency status, or a Green Card, in the United States. Spouses of U.S. citizens are considered "immediate relatives" under immigration laws; therefore they are excluded from all numerical quota limitations. This means that there are an unlimited number of Green Cards available to foreign nationals who marry U.S. citizens. However, the process of completing and submitting a request for a Green Card through marriage can be both costly and confusing. After becoming resident alien there is a naturalization process lasting 5 years until he after passing the all US Immigration service requirements will be sworn as US citizen.|`|88bDvyiwaa	they need to get married anf file for adjustment of status.

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	well, my fiance and i recently ran into a financial emergency and had to cancel our wedding, because we could just not afford to keep planning (such is the terribly annoying nature of emergencys)...so at this point im tempted to just say "**** it" and go run away and elope somewhere with him, because our only other option is to wait another year and ive already waited two years because i had two brothers who got married before me, and i really just dont want to wait that long.<br>  <br>  financially we are doing the smart thing by waiting a year.  but my heart is being annoying and telling me to just go down to the courthouse.
CkN4pgpCaa	I agree that you sort of walked into this.  When you agree to tell each other all the things you haven't been honest about of course it won't be pretty!  <br>  <br>  I don't think this is a dealbreaker.  It was a long time ago and you had just started dating.  She may have not known at first how serious your relationship was going to be.  You said that dated lots of guys and sometimes even at the same time- it may have taken her a little while to realize that this was going to be different.  What matters is what's happened since you've been exclusive.  I admit, I'd be a little disturbed by it too, but it sounds like she's a completely different person than she was before she started dating you, and she takes the relationship very seriously.|`|nqINitkmaa	She was with this other guy before the two of you were serious, they were still together while you guys were dating, if you weren't boyfriend and girlfriend then it wasn't an exclusive relationship, so she didn't do anything wrong. You guys were both dishonest with one another. The truth is out now, I don't think its that big of a deal and I think you are over reacting a bit.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well first of all you two kind of walked into this by "confessing your secrets" right before your wedding like this.  Now you have set the stage for jealousy and dirty looks to each others' friends.<br>  <br>  It's not really fair to be mad at her for lying when you lied too.  I don't think she is going to cheat on you if she slept with someone else before you were boyfriend and girlfriend.  Had you said you were going to be exclusive?  If not, then it's perfectly fine.  Plus, this was a long time ago.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, saying you will retaliate by cheating on the other person if they cheat on you is pretty immature.  Now how would that fix anything?  Maybe you guys aren't ready to be married.|`|3gljWitCaa	always follow your heart<br>  you will never regret following your heart<br>  <br>  hollyy|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Dude, you lied as well so why are you pissed off at her?? Grow up!! If you weren't an "item" Then you had absolutely no claim on her. At least she told you what happened. Obviously she isn't leaving you for something so small. You have trust issues and I advise that you get over your jealousy before you marry the poor girl. You weren't together, you didn't state that you were in a serious relationship when that happened. Therfore she has never cheated on you, you have no right to say that it will happen again.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Allow her past to be her past. The important thing is that since you have become exclusive she has been faithful. BTW why ever did you have such a game? What did you expect? That she would confess to selling girl scout cookies behind your back? You aren't blameless yourself since you slept with her friend several times. Appreciate that she told you the truth. Congratulations on the wedding!|`|AA11184374	your marriage should be base on trust if you think you cant trust her you beter look down deep in your heart. its easy to get married but hard to get a divorce. you need to think long and hard about this. good luck...|`|q6GnofENaa	See these are the kind of things that people should always get into when they really start to get serious, but before you start planning a wedding.  Even if you love the other person things can come as a complete shock and it's human nature.  You just need time to really think about if you trust one another, if you trust each other then there should be no problem.  The fact that she was almost cheating on you makes it obvious that it wasn't a "love at first sight" kind of thing, but I guess it's possible to develop love for each other, whatever you believe in.  So just really sit her down, tell her everything that's been going on in your head and make it clear to her that you're both open books from this point forward.
A6XCcKIuaa	Show them that your responsible enough and tell them how much it means to you and that youll love them forever lol.. <br>  =] x|`|aZvzGTUBaa	Ok, I have tried doing that, but when a parent says no, just go with it. Maybe you could watch the convention of tv|`|eNj4bbKBaa	show them you are responsible and show all the plans to them up front. don't expect them to pay for everything either, so plan to raise a lot of money by then. whatever you do, if they say no, don't freak out. if you freak out and start arguing with them it will only make them say no and mean it more. it will hopefully work unless it's some freaky stripper convention, in which case they should say no.|`|oRK9fjEXaa	try 2 make them see how important it is and show them that you really want 2 go.|`|9OHeder5aa	You could always just go and not tell them.
I7zocOEnaa	Confront her <br>  saying (Along the lines) :why didn't you tell me upfron why did you have to tell everyone about and say thing that hurt me how would you feel?"<br>  If she ingors you and walks away or says something rude stop carpooling her because shes just useing you.|`|lX1zpaoAaa	Your not wrong. Your are also not her damn chauffeur! You should definetly put your family before anyone else and sometimes it's ok to be selfish. If your tired when you come home you should not have  to go out of your way if you did'nt make any promise or arrangement! Good luck! =)
JtJxVBOsaa	No! Buy a black dress. Black dye is tricky, and inexpensive materials won't take well to being dyed. Look for a black bridesmaid or prom dress. There's plenty that look like wedding dresses. Check out offbeatbride.org for some inspiration. You'll save a ton of money and stress if you just look for a black dress from the start, because bridesmaids and prom dresses are much more affordable. You can still have it tailored so it fits like a dream.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Can you? Yes.<br>  <br>  Is it a good idea? NO. Wedding dresses are made of expensive fabrics and covered in embellishments. The color in the dye won't "take" (saturate into the dress) evenly and you'll end up with a streaky hot mess that looks dull.<br>  <br>  You're not going to find a big selection of black gowns at bridal stores. BUT you will find tons of them at department stores, for much better prices than a gown at a bridal boutique. Nordstrom had dozens of black formal gowns - lots of them with full skirts and beautiful embellishment - the last time I was in there. Most were under $500.<br>  <br>  A wedding gown is the dress you wear on your wedding day, not a dress that comes from a wedding store. Don't limit your search to bridal boutiques - look at formalwear in department stores, check the prom selection, etc. Also look at bridesmaid's dresses - many of them are very formal and elegant, and almost always come in black.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/SR/0~2376776~2374327~2374331~6014150?mediumthumbnail=Y&mode=pfind&tuid=5ac8a3da-c3a2-4a79-9a40-46ccfcd02a6e&catID=6014150&color=Black&searchorigin=ProductFinder&findertypereqd=N" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/SR/0~2376776~2...</a>|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No you cannot. Anyone who tells you otherwise has no knowledge whatsoever of how fabrics work. Most fabrics, especially special occasion types (satins, chiffon, etc) can't be dyed and look good since the dye will not distribute evenly and there is nothing you can do to fix that. <br>  <br>  If you want a black (or any other color) dress, you either need to find a bridesmaid dress you love or have it custom made by a reputable seamstress in your area.<br>  <br>  As far as actual dress styles go, the ladies at the Tribe at www.offbeatbride.com are very helpful and resourceful.|`|4lL34wJnaa	My cousin took her dress from her 2nd wedding and dyed it black for her third wedding (she's on husband number 4 now).  It's possible, but I wouldn't recommend it.  <br>  <br>  There are many beautiful black dresses out there that are very appropriate for a wedding.  When Sarah Jessica Parker married Matthew Broderick, she wore a gorgeous black dress!|`|ge3meKYEaa	Nope- just have one made by a streamstress.<br>  Black needs to be done ingrain- on raw goods, dying something presewn with black is a bad idea- it will never be solid or clean looking.<br>  <br>  Also try ebay-<br>  <a href="http://clothing.shop.ebay.com/items/Wedding-Dresses__black-wedding-gown_W0QQ_catrefZ1QQ_dmptZWeddingQ5fDressesQQ_flnZ1QQ_sacatZ63851QQ_trksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em282" rel="nofollow">http://clothing.shop.ebay.com/items/Wedd...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  And try prom gowns- there is not much difference between a puffy prom gown and a wedding dress- just the color.  My friend bought a prom dress that look exactly like a wedding dress and paid $200 instead of the $2,000 the bridal salon wanted- it was the same dress made by the same company- with different tags in it.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	You can, but there is no guarantee that you will get the color you want exactly right. <br>  <a href="http://search.store.yahoo.net/cgi-bin/nsearch?query=black&catalog=edressme&.autodone=http://www.edressme.com" rel="nofollow">http://search.store.yahoo.net/cgi-bin/ns...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.smarter.com/se--qq-black%2Bwedding%2Bgowns.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smarter.com/se--qq-black%2Bwe...</a>|`|uec7RIhbaa	yes you can but be careful - if there is decoration or beading on the dress this may not dye properly or be a different colour so be very very careful!!!|`|No3wL14Yaa	Dying a dress can not only ruin the dress but it may not come out right and then there you are with a ruined dress and in need of another one. I think that you can find some nice black ones, look through prom dresses or even davids bridal bridesmaid dresses because i have seen some of their bridesmaid dresses that could pass for a wedding dress.|`|AA10281237	I would suggest you try styleshake.com. I just read about it on a blog earlier this morning and have been playing with it all day!<br>  <br>  You can pick the type of fabric you want (organic silk, cotton, linen, or metalic silk), the color you want, and then you pick the style of the top, the neckline, the waistline, the bottom skirt style, and add little extras. Then you order it and you get your dream dress within 10 days. <br>  <br>  For the organic silk (which is the most expensive) the dresses are UK 55, US $89 (it's a UK company, fyi). <br>  <br>  This way you'll get the dress you want, already in black, for a price that is much cheaper than anywhere else.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|FoyMUPBCaa	you can ask :<br>  <a href="http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com/weddingdress.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheap-wedding-gowns.com/weddi...</a>|`|AA11184374	you can check at the bridal shop. they might have black dress there.|`|tqFdbFPNaa	um, im sure you can. but why ruin the dress. but its totally up to you.|`|59c96536e96c191de713c98a41de8abcaa	<a href="http://gothicweddingdresses.webs.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gothicweddingdresses.webs.com/ind...</a><br>  <br>  This site has some fantastic cheap wedding dresses & they post free in UK & not much cost to ship to US
ZmdIlkpQaa	I'm not at all what you would call an addict.  I enjoy porn, and sometimes enjoy it with the women in my life.<br>  <br>  I will say this, however.  If he is depriving you of sexual activity because he's spent from self-gratification when watching porn, there is clearly a problem,<br>  <br>  Now, for the rest of your list.<br>  1.  Does looking at porn lead to cheating: No.  In my experience, looking at porn is a relatively healthy way of satisfying the instinctive urge to be promisquous in men.  Instead of actually seeking to bed many different females, porn can allow that instinct to be somewhat satisfied while staying faithful to one's spouse.<br>  2.  I love the women in my life very much, and I sacrifice for them, work hard, and am always affectionate toward them.  Porn has nothing to do, positive or negative, with my ability to love.<br>  3.  Porn  actresses are actresses.  Their physical perfection is eye candy.  My wife has had three children and is 40 years old, and our companion has had two children and is over 30.  I don't hold them to the same physical standards, because they're real women, and are not paid and pampered to look perfect nude on camera.  I vastly prefer the real thing, and while the eye candy is enjoyable, I actually often wish that the actresses and acters looked a little more average.  Ultimately, it's what they're doing, not how they look that arouses me.<br>  4.  I love my partners far, far more, and I don't feel guilty at all.  I indulge primarily when I have some free time (which is rare as hen's teeth these days) and when the women I love are unavailable for a romp.  I don't expect the women I love to be mere sexual playthings, and as a result, if I want to have an "O," then a litle porn and a little hand action are just what the doctor ordered.  <br>  <br>  By the way, I prefer the written dirty stories to the video or pictures, and I think that brings up another point.  If your partner was sexually satifying you, would it bother you if he were reading stories instead of looking at pictures?  If so, why?  If not, then what's the difference?  What if he was merely fantasizing in his mind and enjoying that?  I guess I mean to ask if any masturbatory activity at all on his part is upsetting to you?<br>  <br>  Ultimately, you need to talk to him about his lack of sexual activity with you.  Perhaps he feels that you don't desire him, or perhaps he feels he can't perform to your standards, or perhaps your sex life is a little bland.  What I mean is that if you both can be honest and communicate, you might find a way to make porn work for you.  One suggestion I'd like to make is that you ask him to join him in watching porn with him, and talk about why this or that arouses him, and be honest (and explicit) about what arouses you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|BlVudiyfaa	no<br>  no<br>  yes<br>  no<br>  no|`|CKd4bnV7aa	All the porn addicts can't answer now because they are busy looking at redtube.|`|88bDvyiwaa	no, no cover up<br>  no. my hand is enough<br>  yes<br>  I've never seen airbrushed porn, but no, it does not sicken me.<br>  sometimes.|`|874EAxkfaa	sometimes this addiction? stems from sexual abuse as a child!|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Being an ex-addict, I know the road is not easy. I quit several years ago. The damage will be with me forever, but It gets easier every day.<br>  <br>  You cannot quit for him. He has to make the decision to do what it takes to overcome this. Whether that is counseling, or being influenced by older stronger men who can help him beat this, something has to break.<br>  <br>  For you though, the best thing is to not commit to him any more than you have. Hold to your standards and make it clear it's porn or you. Demand transparency, first in your own life and then his. What does he have to hide, or lose at this point?<br>  <br>  Also, don't listen to the wannabe porn producers who have never known real love on here- make up your own mind about it, set your standards and lay this down as a dealbreaker.

hv2nmmrqaa	I think that we live in an age where you cant define someones interests based on their sex.<br>  <br>  Some guys like sports, i don't. Some girls will like make-up, others wont.<br>  <br>  You just have to use your social skills and find out what they want to talk about and hope that its something your interested in as well.|`|JDC02N8waa	You talk to them about what they like. I'm a girl and I'd kill a guy for assuming I liked shopping and make-up.

q7NrlanJaa	Wow that is my wedding day too!  We are having a small reception at my mother's house. She is going to cook lasagna, salad, and bread stickss.  We should have dessert too.  It all depends on how formal you want it to be, I've heard of doing Pizza Hut, but we decided making Stouffer's lasagna would be a little classier and easy on my mom since she will be busy at the rehearsal too.  Good luck!|`|No3wL14Yaa	i would do something light and fun like a buffet or something like that. No need to be super serious right before the wedding.|`|tqFdbFPNaa	Try to cook something fancy but also not a long time to cook as well.|`|hkwBR1moaa	If you want something more casual, have finger sandwhiches, maybe a pasta, mini meatballs, veggie tray, fruit/cheese tray and maybe some pastries.  <br>  You could also find a local resturaunt and have them do a couple of trays of catered food.  <br>  If you want something more formal, then cook something.  Pasta is always a good choice, as well as a roast and potatoes.  <br>  You couls also fire up the grill and do hamburgers and hot dogs.  <br>  No matter what you decide, it'll be fine.  No ones looking for a formal affair, that's what the wedding is for.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Is there a theme?  Where do you live?<br>  <br>  I am southern and my wedding was a luau (as my theme was tropical) so pig was the perfect idea.  We had bbq which is really inexpensive.<br>  <br>  However what style of rehearsal are you having?  Mine was a party with lots of drinking and dancing.  Some are far more serious.  Pasta is a good cheap idea that everyone loves.<br>  <br>  Are you any ethnicity that would be expected?  I know if your groom is marrying a Mexican lady, her family would find it very odd to not have any Mexican food there.  I have a couple Japanese friends that have been married and they both had a sushi platter there.<br>  <br>  Personally I love when a couple does a tribute to their heritage like serving Mediterranean food or Asian.  However one thing to consider is certain ethnic groups (like Indian) tend to have a lot of vegetarian platters so if you have many vegetarians in the family, consider a meat-free alternative.<br>  <br>  Really it depends on your budget but I do recommend catering.  Don't stress yourself out by trying to cook all day for this event.  After all it's the day before the wedding so you need to remain calm and collected.  Many Italian places do an inexpensive family platter and many restaurants offer catering.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi.  It all depends on how many people you are having and what you want to serve.<br>  <br>  Does your son have a favorite food?  That would be a good start.<br>  <br>  As others have said, pasta (lasagna, stuffed shells, manicotti, etc.) is usually always a hit.  Serve it with a tossed salad and garlic bread or breadsticks.<br>  <br>  You could always do chicken, potatoes, salad, rolls,<br>  Ham is another easy idea.  Put a few hams in the oven and serve with potatoes, rolls, a salad, etc.<br>  <br>  If you live where it's nice outside, you can always grill something if you want.<br>  <br>  Again, if you want to "do things ahead" then I would suggest a pasta meal.  That way all you need to do it to pop it in the oven or set your oven timer.<br>  <br>  Don't forget a dessert (brownies or a groom's cake.)

KIoACPJcaa	just be careful with his emotions and he is going through something rough right now because it sounds like you want your relationship to go to the next level. it can be really hard for guys to commit to a serious relationship and you should know that he is probably acting weird because he doesn't want hurt again and he can't trust you fully with that yet and hopefully over time he can. so don't be so worried. be nice and let him have his space. i wish you the best of luck with this guy he seems really special.|`|NzHTMlo5aa	Don't push him into talking to you about your relationship. When he is ready to talk about it, he will more than likely come to you & want to talk. Also, don't smother him or be really needy. That tends to upset the guy & make him back away more from you. Give him some space, but take it easy. I hope this helps some|`|5nAnWp3daa	men talk when its right for us|`|ZyWMPooJaa	hate to say it, i really dobut he could be on drugs (unlikely tho) thats one reason hes actin dif. could also be because you told him thats hes in your heart and that comforted him and hes beggining to relax. he wont open his heart to u cause he doesnt want it to b broken, again.<br>  i think you should just relax around him and try not to be too aggresive with flirting. ive been thru this stuff b4 and its very confusing, its natural.<br>  I think you should dislike the girls that broke his heart for what thye did, but NEVER remind him of that. otherwise ur relationships going great. good luck.
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	You'll just have to earn the trust of the people you want to socialize with on your own. Its an uphill battle, but in time the facts about your real personality and how trustworthy you are with other people's kids will trump any rumors and bad news your "friend" can spread. Its really the only way to get back at her in a way that's constructive for yourself. Just be more friendly, smile more,talk positively about your own kids and your own home more. Don't put to much emphasis on trying to build a social circle, concentrate on making your own home and pleasant and cheerful as you possibly can, and positive friends will be drawn to you because of it, and even if they aren't, you'll be making yourself and your home happy, which is the most important thing anyway.

The opposite isnt as bad because men age better than women. I am with a guy 4 yrs. younger. I like 'em younger & like most people said the guys like the older women because they are experienced. They feel they are not going to play these mind games or be controlling or jealous like females their same age are gonna be.|`|hUt8Vt7oaa	I think it's fine. The main problem is the social stigma-- people might give a couple like this crap for their age disparity. I wouldn't worry about that though.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're the woman, my advice to you is that you absolutely amaze him in the bedroom. You know, use your experience to make him addicted to you. This way, he's can't think about anybody younger.|`|QFLN2xgeaa	I actually have seen an 18 yr old and a 36 yr old date, and marry.

Truthfully its nothing to worry about, in my opinion of course.|`|YFvXRutJaa	these days ages doesn't really matter. the reason why people find it usual is because of the opposite sex. its not the ages its the intimacy. if your dating an older female than just look as it as an over view pattern of dating an older woman. its the sex that they find it usual not the ages.|`|6HRRPpODaa	Well it depends what both parties are looking for.

I know I have.  I got some of my best poetry written during those times.  That was my outlet.  You need to find a good outlet for your sorrow.<br>  <br>  It's okay to feel sad and it's okay to cry.  Don't try to force it.  Just let it come.  It's these times of sorrow that help us define happier times.  Feel the sorrow embracing you, bask in it.  But only for a while.  It's not a good place to stay.  Necessary to visit, but not a good place to live:)<br>  <br>  One day, you will find someone who will love you back.

I failed most of my exams at school and the future looks bleak for me... do I want to cry? No... crying won't help me. What should you do?

If you feel like you can't cry, it may be the fact that a part of you really didn't want to be with them in the first place. Crying isn't the answer. Now, telling them how you feel (or think you feel) will help alleviate some of the stress that you are holding onto. If there is a real reason, that you cannot have them, then it will help with the grieving process. However, sometimes humans get caught up in the idea of being with someone, it's not true love. So, maybe give yourself some time to think it over. Try to relax. A good way to get rid of that edginess feeling too, is to write your feelings down on paper. Good luck =]|`|d72zbrS4aa	i went through the same thing but in the end i told them how i felt and we got together . honestly at first your so happy , becasue your like omg were together i love you but in the end you may find something out thats weird .. in the end you may figure that you really never did love them it was the fact that you couldnt have something you really wanted and when you get you could careless that you got it . it like a brand new ipod or phone . so really think about what you think is love . cause in the end it could only be want|`|LoIhwvo9aa	look, sweetie, you dont need to make your self cry. seems to me that you got some unresolved issues and even if you do make yourself cry what if you feel a void so i think your best bet it to spare yourself tears and tell this girl how you feel. you never know, you seem like a sweet guy and what girl wouldnt want a sweet guy like you?? If you just tell her how you feel then she'll be in your arms. many guys fail to see that girls want the guy to make the 1st move and open up and tell us how you feel!!!! theres onl 1 flaw and thats if she already has a boyfriend..and it dosnt sound like she does so, so far your good....SO GO FOR IT!!!:-D|`|sntmmx4gaa	Try writing some of your own poetry. Sometimes seeing things on paper puts things more in check. If they don't love you back then, skew them. They weren't worth your time. You will find someone!

I really urge you to finish the book and follow the laws of attraction, however it's a long process and rarely will anything you really believe in happen overnight. It's not that unusual to believe and that's all the laws of attraction are asking you to do.<br>  <br>  Your husband needs other support, maybe you're the one to do that and maybe not. His attitude is a large part of your life. If he is disenfranchised by your activities, possibly he should pitch in a little more or possibly he is adding to your work load. No one reading your question really knows for sure because there is always two side to every story, but one thing is for sure; if you two don't learn to communicate effectively you will both fail the test of time for your marriage.

I texted like twice and still no reply then when i actually saw her i said whats up and she just said the argument hert her and i apologized and gave her a hug and we made up.

WUwIk3Fgaa	Yeah, it's kind of like the "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink" kind of thing with you trying to have sex with your wife....good luck with that. sorry I don't think this is the kind of answer you were looking for, but I couldn't resist when I read the first part of your question. lol.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	A husband's role is to be the Priest, Prophet, Provider, & Protector of his wife, home, and children.  You don't literately lead your wife, you figuratively lead your home.  The rest follows.  Read the Bible and you will learn what the roles are for men and women who are married.  As far as decisions and directions, you are to talk about things with your wife and come to a decision together.  I wouldn't lead her, if you do you will have to buy a leash and no one wants to be treated like that.|`|6fd4e1a5aa0206bfc6a1ce509a0f2507aa	The Word of God is very clear that a man is supposed to be the head of the house.<br>  HOWEVER..........it is also very clear as to HOW that is to be done.<br>  As Christ is to the church.........He DIED for her.<br>  Dying to yourself, your wants and desires to give your absolute everything to your wife, closely resembles what Jesus did.<br>  He LOVED, unconditionally.  He Understood, had mercy, made a way where there seemed to be no way. <br>  He went above and beyond the call of duty, bent over backwards and would......and DID ...........WHATEVER was necessary to win her back when she turned her back on Him.<br>  I'm sure you get the picture!<br>  If a woman had a husband that would rather die than live without her, following him, would not be a problem!<br>  A man doesn't set direction for the woman.  God sets the direction.<br>  You are a little vague.  <br>  You are to protect and serve her as a Tender Warrior.<br>  Promise Keepers and Jerry Johnston should be of help to you.<br>  And the Authority ....in Ephesians!|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Do you believe the man should be the role model: Yes but he is also to be equal with his wife at all times and in all things . A relationship between a man and a women is to be united together at all times. If not, then one seek to gain power over the other and this is wrong in the eyes of God.|`|jBjc1UACaa	YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YE YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESYES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESY ES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	No, but he is supposed to lead his family.|`|ZEitfScGaa	No, in a marriage you go together, side by side. You should both be equal.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	So how is the cave working out for you?|`|eWMn7dhKaa	THERE'S the INTERNET HATE MACHINE we all love to hate!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	No, I belive that all people, regardless of gender should be strong enough as individuals to set their own direction, and to be good role models.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I believe in whatever works for the couple. I want a husband who leads, but different people have different relationship styles.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No, not really. My husband may be my kids' role model but my father is mine. I don't really believe in leaders but that goes as far from a civil rights leader to a tour guide. I honestly feel as if people can and should provide and direct their own way. Therefore, my husband and I together set the direction for our family. I set my direction. He sets his direction. Fortunately, we're both headed in each others direction. <br>  <br>  I want a husband, not a father. He doesn't provide for me. He didn't get me thru college. He doesn't sustain my lifestyle. I do and did all of that. It actually bothers me when I see someone being dependent on someone when they can do otherwise because I vividly remember being a kid and looking forward to being an adult and providing for myself and my family. I can't understand how an adult can fully rely on someone else for something and still consider themselves an adult.|`|IvMPh09baa	every response you give to every question on here is about your lack of sex from your wife... you can't even lead your wife into the bedroom.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes I believe the man should be the leader in the family/marriage.  I know that I look to my husband to lead and provide for me and our future family.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	He's SUPPOSED to.<br>  <br>  The problem is a) we're raising poor leaders with no back bone these days and b) we never get any appreciation for the leadership we real men provide.<br>  <br>  So frankly, I'd advise against it...not on the condition that it's wrong, but rather because there is no profit in it for a man.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|aDIPIu7xaa	"DIane" here got it right!<br>  <br>  Good Job Diane!|`|cGbTJobeaa	Biblically speaking, the wife should submit to her husband. However, the husband has to be worthy of his wife's submission.<br>  <br>  In our house, my husband and I do not have power struggles because I accept his ultimate authority in our home. I have a ton of authority in how I run the household and I do not have to ask my husband for permission for things, etc.  He is my husband not my father.  About 99% of the time my husband and I are in agreement anyway.  <br>  <br>  For the other 1% of the time when there is disagreement, my husband makes the ultimate decision and I respect and follow his decision.  The decision is the decision. Period.  It's not worth the power struggle.  I married a good man whom I love, trust and respect.  When he makes a decision, I know that he has taken my opinion into account. I have no problem accepting my husband's lead because he is worthy of me and not after his own self-interest. I most definitely have a voice in our marriage.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	I do believe in the man bing the king of the castle to a certain extent. Like taking out trash and shoveling snow and paying the bills. I clean the toilet, go to school, help cook (we both do the other chores) But he takes on a lot of responsibility. We also don't have kids.

vUVxS9Xhaa	I was described as very nice but not too good looking when i was in highschool...but once i matured and got a little older i had to bat women off with a stick...<br>  <br>  so if he is nice and you like his personality then yeah give him a chance...sometimes men arent super good looking until they have had a chance to mature.<br>  <br>  Its funny you know a lot of the "good looking" kids from my highschool i recently met up with a lot of them for a reunion and most of them are fat and ugly....and here i am all hot looking, fit etc...<br>  <br>  so thats something to think about.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You need to live up to your words. Being nice to someone does come with a responsibility. You told him you like him and also told him that you would go out with him. You cannot back down now. Don't give too much importance to the looks. He may turn out to be a real nice guy.|`|Z6lhZiXsaa	Just tell you you will hang out with him some before you decide if you want to date him. If nothing else, you guys can at least be friends.|`|V6dz395kaa	You should because it will be a nice thing to do and make him happier.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	u shooed   get to know him more before dating him|`|tT04bRLraa	a lot of people just ask "will u go out with me" and instantly put a label on it. u need to date. dont call yourself bf gf. tell him "yea well go out and see how it goes etc bla bla" make sure you tell him that your not his gf yet. that way if you let him take you on a date. your giving him a chance, but not totally pittying him. then if it doesnt work since you dont like him just tell him it didnt go as well as you hoped it was...then your free and not stuck with him but at the same time gave him a chance helping him out as well. men n women are supposed to date. not jus. will u go out with me...bam dun. u need to go slow and do it how its ment to be done. no one gets hurt and everyone ends up happy. thats all i got. i have no other ideas. this one seems to be right on target tho haha. give it a try. if it doesnt work post another Q and someone will help u further|`|EQTJxrEtaa	I've had the same problem before... <br>  do what you really want- it's crazy going out with a guy you don't really like. Just tell him sorry but you just want to be friends- you feel terrible when you do it, but it has to be done if you feel that way. <br>  Good luck :)|`|Hs8ZzDL8aa	You're not doing him any favors by leading him on.  In fact, you're making it harder on him and yourself.<br>  <br>  Tell him the truth. He deserves it.  I'd rather a girl reject me than date me because she feels bad.|`|FtS9Guecaa	give him a chance i mean how bad could he be???? if you dont like him after the date then tell him if you dont think its gonna wrok or something but give him a chance|`|c9SmMYDDaa	I know how you feel hun. I've been there and done that.  Maybe you should just give him a chance you never know you might end up loving him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:-)|`|GSe6owcPaa	dont get with him out of sympathy. just say sorry. say oops i did it again. <br>  <br>  10 points!!|`|KIgEBTI6aa	just be straight up with him. tell him that you just want to be friends because you think that going out with him would mess up your friendship. he'll get over it eventually.|`|QFLN2xgeaa	If hes a nice guy, I would go for it. They don't grow on trees ya know. If hes not that good looking don't worry about it, just if you like him then date him. If you don't like him, then just let him down slow and easy. Maybe even try hooking him up with another person. Don't be a jerk and say "I think you should go out with someone else," just ask around and see if anyone else likes him. Then try to persuade him to like them back. If this doesn't work tell him you might date in the future and you just want to remain friends.<br>  I hope this helps!|`|d72zbrS4aa	ok first of all it was nice of you to make him feel better about him self . but say no more if he asks your putting your self in a bigger hole. <br>  <br>  if he asks you out honestly tell him that you don't have those kind of feelings for him . tell him you can see you both as good friends and maybe over time who knows you may end up liking him. <br>  don't let him make you feel bad for turning him down. you can also say . " don't be upset, there's millions and millions of people out there and just like you there looking for that special one " you can also state that hes a nice guy and he can do much better than the previous bunch of bitchy girls hes been going for . if you don't like him don't go out with him simple has that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck hope i was of some help :)
be0YaDUPaa	Be careful.  Even if your relationship isn't physical, you still may be providing him with something he should be getting from his wife.  Seldom is one half of a married couple entirely to blame for all the marital problems.  Many "affairs" start out as friendships so please don't convince yourself that you aren't part of the problem when you very well might be an alternative he is considering.  You know what is really going on, don't spin it.  If you are truly a friend that wants the best for him, you will encourage him to talk to his wife and seek counseling to repair their marriage.  You will also limit the time you two talk and/or spend together UNTIL he has decided to fix his marriage or leave it. To answer your specific question...some people decide they aren't happy and immediately move toward ending their marriage, and others stay in unhappy marriages for their entire lives.  How much a person can take varies greatly from person to person.|`|wZb7zilKaa	That’s the classic players move.  He wants to real you in to be his mistress don't fall for it!  If you are not dating then start dating.  Don't give this man the impression that you are waiting for him!  So hows being his FRIEND working out for you??????|`|rKaUdhLUaa	My parents did it for 23 years. The year after my youngest brother graduated highschool they divorced.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Sorry to disappoint you but some people stay married even if their not really happy.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	They will stand it for as long as it could be stood.  When they hit their breaking point, they will leave.|`|874EAxkfaa	GET OUT OF THEIR LIVES!  you are a canker sore.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Sometimes people work out their differences even when it seems impossible. People change. It's best to just leave them alone to handle things so that you don't complicate their life any more than it is already.|`|AA11596133	Extremely selfish arrogant people like your friend, can and will hang on until they literally are thrown out on their ear. <br>  <br>  I find it interesting that you admire him pretending to care or to really be something he is not. And of COURSE he does not want to give up anything he has worked so hard for - who DOES?  He may deserve an academy award for his acting skills, BUT, by doing this, he is a LIAR. For that, eventually he WILL regret the effects this will have on his kids.  As soon as they figure out that Dad is just a selfish lying jerk that has emotionally abused them, they will turn on him with a vengeance. My parents played the "stay together for the kids and financial reasons" too - when they told my brother and I this, we were MAD - I mean REALLY mad.  My brother never did forgive my parents, it took me many years to.  If your friend really thinks his attitude is the RIGHT way to live, believe me, he is dead wrong. He is USING his own family for HIS personal benefit.  That is UGLY.  WHY on Earth would you even think of wanting him IF he got divorced??  I would not EVER consider dating ANY guy who admitted they play games with peoples heads!!!  His wife NO DOUBT knows he is a fake - could you be attracted to someone you know does not want to be with you?  She just keeps him around because she is just as lazy and selfish as he is! <br>  <br>  Like I said, people who put their own needs ahead of anyone elses, CAN and DO stay in dead relationships forever if possible. They deserve each other - but the kids sure don't.  Just wait - mark my words and see for yourself.|`|IvMPh09baa	when you stop living your life based on what other people tell you.<br>  <br>  your one of those people that if someone told you to jump off a bridge, you would.|`|ERxADoBAaa	Honey you need to move on , give them room and quit dreaming.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	Please don't tell me you are believing all of that BS he is feeding you!!!   He is likely just trying to get his chance to screw you and thinks that if he tells you all this stuff you will go for it.  The only thing you know about their marriage is what he tells you, and iti s probably all lies.<br>  <br>   EDIT   Keep telling yourself what you need to.  Here's my question, if you aren't interested in a relationship with him why do you even care about his marriage???  You sound like the typical homewrecker to me.|`|naequcqlaa	It just cannot go on forever.  If something is not "fed", eventually it w/become deceased one way or another.  You can only tolerate something for so long, then I believe resentment starts to build up. I am not one to staying together for the sake of the kids either.  Kids are smarter than we realize they are, & they feel things are just not rite it the household.  Yes, unfortunately their lives are affected, but a home w/o true love cannot keep going on forever.  Eventually something/someone has to "give".  But again, like everything else, w/o "nourishment" this eventually will fade & bad feelings w/start to set in.  It just cannot be helped.  Happiness is what makes the world go round & unhappiness eventually sets in & all is lost in the end.  Who knows how long it w/take, but it sure cannot  last like this forever.  The kids w/get older & realize just what's going on in their home.  They w/be the ones no doubt who w/bring it all to lite as they realize their home is just not like their friends are.  Pretty soon that "front" w/crumble & it all w/come tumbling down.  Only time w/tell how long this can last as it's already a reality.  But, it WILL in fact happen.  I lived this life & know the ending it all came into being. Take care...:)

277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	That's a great question. One way to work on this is to simply think about and write down what are the things about you you like, what you want to improve, where you want to be in life, and how do you plan to get there. Really write it down, like get a good journal and take some time, little by little, and figure out a game plan to create a dream life for yourself. Sleep on it and then add some more. Its your life, and as your dream develops you'll realise that you'll have the answer to the question.|`|iK7VXri7aa	thats your problem|`|7585zXZIaa	Human :]|`|DbuDaEqnaa	It's weird when someone says something that just makes you take a step back and slow down. I don't think anyone knows the answer to that themselves, nor does anyone have just one personality. People are different on different days, with different people, in different places, that's just what humans do - adapt. <br>  People have a rough idea just like yourself, but I wouldn't try to analyse yourself too much. People do things because they want to, you can theorise all you want about them and try and find explanations for who they are, but basically they just do things because they want to. <br>  Also, if you do 'figure' yourself out, what if you want to change? You will have set ideas of who you are in your head and it will be hard to change. Looking back, I've tried to figure out who I am and now I'm just totally confused and I end up just second guessing myself and not just 'living'.<br>  One piece of advice-go with your gut instinct, not with your head.<br>  Hope that helps :)|`|EtIIlqebaa	the whole world is asking themself the same question hun.|`|AA12135516	Believe it or not you are no different to most of us!

277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	You can't force yourself to be attracted to someone when you're not. Its jus not possible and doesn't work out. And by holding on to the past and what you had, you're preventing yourself from finding true love and being yourself around your new relationships. You absolutely have to let go. Even if your ex does get back together with you, you need to understand that very probably the relationship will never be the same. Just let go of the past.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	If he's still using.

If you do register, you can remain completely anonymous. Read through the FAQs and guidelines to see what is and is not acceptable while posting.  Best of luck to you both.

D3hYbsVJaa	That is entirely up to you- although know this-<br>  <br>  Pornography is a dismally inaccurate portrayal of real sex. They use looping, multiple angles of the same time frame, over-acting on the part of the women involved and prosthetic body parts to make it look glamorous and hot. In reality, most of these actors are worse in bed than Stan Walker from Will&Grace. <br>  <br>  The Industry also uses and abuses young men and women  like tissue paper. The more notable producers would like you to believe that's not the case anymore, but many young people fall prey to the casting couch and never see a penny, while the footage of such winds up on internet pay sites.<br>  <br>  Even if they could straighten all this out, people are still naturally addicted to sex acts on video. There are some who can watch it very occasionally. That's a small group though.<br>  <br>  I will also put forward that western culture, especially in the US, breeds people who are both afraid and obsessed with sexuality. Should we all be able to see it and not obsess over it? Yes, but sadly there are many who can't. It's up to you to decide whether or not you're going to watch pornography.

It just depends on the person and their persobnal preferences.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	I'd like to be comfortable watching porn but I always end up feeling like a pervert watching other people doing their business.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	No porn is not bad its your choice weather you let it leads to something else.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	It can lead to sex. My wife and I both enjoy it to some degree.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	It is not bad to watch porn, almost anything done in moderation is not a bad thing.  Without moderation, it can get to be pretty bad.<br>  <br>  It can lead to any one of many things... sex, addiction, fantasies, dreams, nightmares, ideas, fights, divorce, marriage, kids, writing, art, photography, drinking, drugs, sleep, etc...|`|ZEitfScGaa	It is not bad to watch porn, in moderation. I watch it with my wife from time to time, just to spice things up a little. <br>  However, porn for some people can be very bad. Porn can become a serious addiction.<br>  <br>  ADD: Also, in todays world porn is more accessible than ever. And kids are watching it from a very young age now. With the internet, I see the porn issue becoming a major problem very soon.|`|EbUSYjLRaa	there is good porn and bad porn, it depends on your taste in sex like i would not like to see two guys going at it, but hey it maybe your thing and that is ok, my wife and i love all kinds of porn together, and i also watch it alone|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	Porn is GREAT. Anyone that says it's wrong is either a repressed loser or a closet porn addict.|`|xQnkYyocaa	Watching it with you guy/girlfriend is GREAT!! It can help your "intimate time" be quite diffterent/fun.
DwkUUQqhaa	First of all, not to be rude, but that's not him offering you oral, that's him trying to get oral. Now, with that said, that's pretty much all he was looking for. I'm sorry, honey, that sucks but sometimes people act a certain way to get what they want, and it probably will continue from there. If I were you, I'd forget about him.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you do, and have a wonderful day! <3|`|uVL1kJr4aa	forget him. he just wants you for oral sex.|`|43af24d69b63686cd1026c516a4637a8aa	Ditch him he is a LOSER.|`|TliiyvnKaa	Look honey, that's just rude of him. There are steps in relationships and now a days you need to think before you leap. You need to realize a relationship like this will hav eyou pregnant and alone most likely if it continues to be that much about sex. Guys ecspecially in America are so freee and don't have respect for women and the fact that sex is sacared. You should rexamine the situation. Mnay guys will offer things for thier own selfish needs, but you should have love and trusr before you let a giy get that close................|`|SP3a6fGiaa	FORGET HIM ......you shouldn't even think twice about this question!
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? if i were her i would at least get 2 bunk beds, put those in the bedroom and let the boys have the only bedroom, and all would have their own beds that way, and I would sleep in the living room...|`|UhAHaOWFaa	No one over the age of  6 (with exceptions until age 10) should sleep in their parents room.|`|dQCZDAqgaa	very bad. tell the judge.|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	No, but until the court hears about it .. at least he's safe.<br>  <br>  The ideal math should be one person per bed. At least two per bedroom (of the same sex) for kids having their own space .....<br>  <br>  Give it some time .. as long as she isn't teaching him under the sheets .. time will work it out.|`|A8k9NHigaa	nope definitely not.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	No way.|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	Nope, he needs his own bed.  And in most states you can't get custody if the child doesn't have their own bed.<br>  <br>  Whether anything is happening there or not, I'm sure the child at a minimum feels different about being the only child in the family sleeping with mom.|`|rYCud1IQaa	That's really not fair on the kid, and besides 4 children shouldn't be living in a 1 bedroom house. They each deserve their own room, or at least 2 rooms between the 4 of them. I think the kids should live with their father.|`|EeGlkABPaa	no thats just weird, and in the long run it'll probably have some damaging affect on the kid, ne needs to grow up and begin to gain some independance|`|eawDlYHnaa	thats disgusting for that age. no child that old should be sleeping in the same bed with any family member... she should at least make him a bed on the floor but not with her!|`|vEv2YwWdaa	It is not OK.  Call in a 51A.  Child services will investigate, that child may need help.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	In my opinion no its not ok.|`|fgwbylGkaa	Twelve is kind of old to be doing that. It sounds a little disturbing.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	no it is not|`|fBso80Ubaa	It's not OK, barring some really extenuating circumstances, for a 12-year-old boy to sleep in the same bed with his mother.  (It's also unacceptable, although not as seriously, for him to sleep in the same bed with his father, either.)  At 12, a person is approaching puberty.  So sharing a bed with his mother could lead to some undesirable consequences down the road.  I think he should sleep in the same room with his brothers.  In fact, same-age, same-sex relatives are the only people who a 12-year-old boy should be sharing a bed with, if sharing it at all.|`|mcxM2jhiaa	"So, America... I'd like YOUR opinion :)"<br>  <br>  :O! What about australia?! <br>  <br>  but yeah, its bad. let the judge know.... rasing kids up like that. pfft|`|4pYrkOuXaa	Personally i Think not because a boy needs to become a man !|`|gnqJ1gq3aa	not ok|`|dcd54bde0dcf0fded26f5e83f52a04dbaa	no he is at a age that its not a good idea or a smart one|`|P8usrLJOaa	I have a 14 year old and no I wouldnt of been comfortable at having him sleep with me at 12 no.Maybe this mom is doing the best that she can for the time being.I think children should be with their mother.She probably just left this big house and is making it in this 1 bedroom.Give her time she will do what she has to.Hey atleast shes trying to keep her children unlike the mother on here thats trying to leave hers.Props to her.I think its great that the dad wants the kids too.Most men or I should say alot of men would rather not after a breakup maybe he should try and help the mother out.|`|o3zLlogMaa	Well, just to see it from the other side for a moment - when they divorced why was she left with a one bed house when she is looking after their children and he has a four bed to himself? Maybe if he was a bit more considerate of the fact she would be left raising his children then provisions could have been made so that their living conditions were more adequate (why wasn't she the one to get the 4 bed?).<br>  I'm sure under the circumstances she is doing her best and for the sake of the all of them, they come to an agreement where time with each parent is as fair as possible.
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	That is very much the norm. And the fact that you have someone to have sex with and the time and energy to do so, definitely go for it. Don't feel bad for getting lots of sex.|`|X6hK915Naa	truthfuly there is no amount you just do it if your in the mood i just suggest dont do it as much cuz then the feeling will die off and once that does the need for each other will too and that leads to breaking up have sex but not as much prolly twice a week tops ok ....good luck|`|h2ZDRpmDaa	Sounds about right. I'm 18 and my husband is 21 and we have sex everynight sometimes 2 or 3 times a day on the weekend or in the storage room at his work.;p lol|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	that's normal|`|uMT3TqXeaa	Wht is wrong with u dude????
hkwBR1moaa	My mom found nice MOB, MOG dresses at David's Bridal for all three of her kids.  She picked a dress in our favorite colors.  Mine is purple, my sister green, and red (burgandy) for my brother.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	A line normally looks good on everyone and (OBVIOUSLY, but not always) stay away from anything too flashy, showing too much cleavage, or anything too sparkly etc. Also (normally) red, white, and black are stayed away from.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I got married 26 years ago, so I'm probably way out of date, but where I live (Metro NY suburbs), the mother of the bride usually wears a long gown in a color that complements, but does not exactly match, the color of the bridesmaids' gowns.  Tradition holds that the mother of the groom must not wear the same color as the mother of the bride.  Of course, a more casual wedding would call for a shorter, less formal dress.  <br>  My mom is very petite, under 5 feet tall.  She wore a lovely floor-length lavender gown to my wedding with a scattered subtle floral print here and there.  (This was a problem, because my mother-in-law wanted to wear lavender, and my mom already had her dress.  But it worked out; my mother-in-law wore a pretty peach-colored gown.)  <br>  What I'd do is talk to someone in a bridal shop, preferably where your future daughter-in-law got her gown, and ask for some guidance.  I'm sure they'd be happy to help.|`|4lL34wJnaa	My mom is trying to figure out what to wear to my wedding right now.  I would say a conservative dress that coordinates with, but doesn't necessarily match the wedding colors.  <br>  <br>  For example, my wedding colors are light blue and white and my mother is looking into wearing a light purple dress (if she can find one she likes).<br>  <br>  If you still aren't sure, go to www.theknot.com.  They have a ton of dresses for everyone involved with a wedding!  You just have to click on the Dresses! tab at the top and then the link on the left for Mother of the Bride/Groom (I think it says bride, but both mothers should be dressed in similar styles anyway).  You may have to register with the site, but it's absolutely FREE!  It'll give you some great ideas.|`|CrjozlCjaa	Something classy and chic - with a hat or fascinator if you don't like hats.    Chose something in a colour you know suits you.    I wore a pink dress and coat for my eldest son's wedding and creaam floral dress and jacket for the second son's special day.    I felt great.|`|lNqSx1znaa	My mother wore a gorgeous silk dress in petal pink. She looked great!|`|2d54b3b79d511b7fa83d0ac8650aa284aa	There are some great tips on this website--<a href="http://www.audreysmotherofthebride.com--for" rel="nofollow">http://www.audreysmotherofthebride.com--...</a> the mother as they specialize in dresses for the mother of the bride or groom.<br>  <br>  Check with the bride on the color theme of the wedding and ask her what colors she feel may complement those colors.  It is also appropriate to ask the mother of the bride what color she will be wearing and whether it is long or short.  Take your cue from there.|`|q7NrlanJaa	I say it depends on the formality of the wedding and time of day.  Mine is a somewhat casual and smaller wedding but we are serving dinner.  My mother bought a light blue dress that is knee length but very fancy looking and has a jacket with some embellishments around the waist.  I would say something that covers everything up and is a color that is pleasant, not too loud and fits the season and/or the wedding colors.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Well,it depends on the wedding.  Is it formal?  Outside, inside?  I wore a floor length dress when my daughter was married in December 2008.  It was platinum in color.  Her bridesmaids wore red.  It all depends on the setting of the wedding!  Congratulations!
gPlUDaRoaa	Well.she is your friend,just explain the situation  to her.I am sure she would understand.Tell her your plan for the reception you want to throw for her or maybe ask her if she would just like some cash as a gift.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Call her, make sure you send your rsvp (if she sent one or if you still have one), declined, send her a nice gift (or throw her a small party). It's a tough economy, i'm sure she will be understanding, if not she's not a very good friend.|`|vpeZTL9Laa	Just screw the job and go to the wedding.  It wouldn't hurt if you took a couple days off!|`|CrjozlCjaa	Most new jobs will honour holiday commitments so you should tell them upfront that you have this date booked.   If they refuse, I think you may need to put your friend first this time and look for a part time fill in job until after the wedding when you can really job hunt.    I will be really surprisd if they don't give you this time off however.    I have never known anyone to be let down before in this respect.|`|PqGCeIelaa	Your friend would understand. Just send her a REALLY nice gift or a nice amount of money.|`|AA10065197	if shes really your friend she'll understand. just send her a gift and get together for  dinner or something later|`|MaLwr7bXaa	I think if you sat down with your friend and just talked to her and told her your situation i think she would understand. With the way our economy is at the moment it would be a bad choice to risk losing this job. I think the reception is a good idea, it will let her know you care and want her to be happy. But if you still arent sure just follow your heart and im sure you will make the right choice. (: good luck with ur job and friend.|`|e7536c9db9e37522b7d883df0bc0e3a1aa	In this economy you really have to worry about the long run.  If she is actually a good friend she wouldn't expect you to pass up a job opportunity.  Just explain to her the situation and discuss it to work something out.  Would you want your friend to pass up a job to be at your wedding?|`|gpL7W3jAaa	Some companies let you take time off if a trip was preplanned before you were hired. Meaning if you already booked a flight, hotel, etc. So you should find out if this is true with this new job. You may very well be able to take the time off. Find out before stressing about it.|`|SToOdHj1aa	Under those circumstances, she should understand.  Talk with her about your situation.  A job is more important than a wedding.  If she is a real friend she won't be mad.|`|KrT5b44yaa	i personally would ask the friend in question to reschedule their wedding and if they cant then get them a gift and they should understand that the job is important|`|QiYYcUMVaa	get them a nice gift.  they should understand that getting a job is very important to you.
jdah4ZA2aa	You're hanging out with party boys, probably. A lot of them just want to have a good time themselves.  Which to boys, means sleeping around. Not always, but often.  They may think you're too cool a person to lay meaningless game down on.|`|CIGRQqd7aa	Not intimidated, they just don't see girls like that as relationship bound.<br>  <br>  I've dated girls like that, they come off as more like friends and if you get to the point of having sex it's going to be like a game.<br>  <br>  Basically most guys call these fun girls, note, not whores, just girls you like to spend time with as a friend.<br>  <br>  It's just weird because when it comes to intimacy everything seems like a joke and after a while you find the relationship meaningless.|`|8pXJIL6xaa	first off weed will get you into trouble and smoking is bad it makes your breath smell like a ash tray and your cloth stink no thay are not intimidated by you thay just dont know how to tell you you stink and that weed will get you into alot of trouble|`|9a3fC9mOaa	I smoke weed, and I drink too, but I love the shy girls that don't do anything, it's a lot more of a challenge|`|aLLWID9xaa	Interesting question 88.<br>  Maybe you're right, they probably feel intimidated. But I think that is  your attitude. <br>  Personally, I don't smoke and don't like girls who smoke, but probably it's not that your smoking or drinking make guys just hang out every now and then with you and nothing else, I think that is the attitude you have that make them feel as if you were a guy not a girl.<br>  Axel|`|qpkXD4RCaa	Well, I don't think smoking week or drinking is good for you, but i'll answer your question.  Their not intimidated by you, they think of you as "one of the guys."  Its more like your a friend to them, so because of that they either refuse or do not want to pursue a relationship with you.  So find another group and look for someone there.|`|SR1FN2nqaa	i think that maybe they are due to your self confidence to be able to be yourself and hang out with them. thats a good thing also....they know and see your not so easily swaded by influences..good girl.|`|thPdBRupaa	Intimidated, no, disgusted, yes. It's the truth|`|dee0a38a3e3de19888ff6398150a975faa	Who furnishes the weed ?  The liquor ?  The place to drink and smoke ?|`|3o7ULYoLaa	It makes you look easy!|`|PJZRGsc3aa	i don't hang with smokers and if you consider doing those two things a good time you need a reality check|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	They aren't intimidated by you. They just don't like stoned drunks who usually puke on them.
nspaGCh9aa	I hate my sisters dad (former step dad) so much it's not even funny.  He cheated on my mom when my sister was only about 3 and I was 6.  Disrespect my mom and you lose me forever.  Disrespect me and u fucked up.  He tries to act like he's all nice now and he thinks he's all holy because he's a minister when this bastard can't even pay child support or visit his child.  He's a terrible man.|`|AA11806606	By hating your dad, only you lose.  Grow up and face the facts of life.  There is no guarantee that any marriage will work out and if it doesn't; one spouse will move on  And as a kid, you need to move on also.  Learn to live with this new person, or you will end up not having a Dad at all.  Your loss, not hers.|`|heCuvfPSaa	I use to like my step-dad I didn't care what my mothers side of the family thought I like him because he was there for my mother and he made her laugh now he is a dick he hurts her in away that he thinks we don't understand what he is saying but we do and all lhe did was prove my mothers side of the family right|`|tb0NMaooaa	I don't hate him anymore<br>  <br>  I used to. He would call me fat and ugly all the time. I didn't eat meat and he would tell me that no guy would marry me because i dont eat meat (crazy!) He would always tell me how horrible I am. He would hit me.<br>  <br>  I fought back.  I've grown up now and don't really care for him but prohaps in his own way, he loves me. I dont think so as he doesn't show it.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should talk to your dad. Thats how things got better for me. Tell him how he was cool and now things have changed. Give him examples.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|AA12320776	I don't hate my dad..I don't like my brothers very much..they are very selfish and were not their for me when I was near deaths door...I'm trying to work out a way to deal with them, but for the moment, they are a bunch of jerks!|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Saying that you "hate" your parent seems very childish to me. Your dad is allowed to have a life aside from his children. Save the word "hate" for a situation more meaningful for the word.|`|ttd5hPEIaa	i dont hate my dad but he got remarried 2 years ago and she is cool but she controls him and makes him monitor us all the time. i used to be able to come home as late as i wanted like 3:00 at age 16 but im 18 now and i have to come home by 12. whenever my brothers or i do something wrong he wont really care but then she yells at him for not doing anything. now he always tries to tell me what to do and he has become a real softy....like a bitchh. he is also old so he acts like an old man and its annoying like he moves really slow when he does stuff and he treats me like im 8. dont get me wrong i love him but i cant wait to go to college in the fall to get away|`|BdJLiv7Laa	I love my Daddy. He's my hero. He's willing to lay down his life for his country and helps anyone who needs it. My Dad's a Marine. But i didn't post this to tell you about him.  <br>  My Biological Father, was an evil man. He used to abuse me and my brother, Nathan, He would beat the tar out of us for no reason, and his favorite way to put out a cigarette was to use my arm, He was always drinking and when i was 3ish he got remarried to some chick he met at some bar. You wanna talk about an evil stepmother, she never physically harmed me or Nate, but worse she watched my Dad do it and would laugh. I haven't seen my biological father in almost 10 years and I still have nightmares about him. <br>  That being said I don't hate him. and truth be told you probably don't hate your dad either. I found a way to forgive my abusive Father, and Step mother.  I bet you can forgive yours too.|`|AUagSXp0aa	I just lost my father in Jan. Please don't hate him over his new lady. Life is too short and until he passes away you realize that, then it will be too late. Talk to him about his behavior and tell him how much you love him everyday. Was your relationship w/him already strained b/f this woman?|`|AQpDDrrVaa	you shouldn't "hate" your dad. One day he will pass and you wouldn't be able too say you love him. I don't liike my mom.

nqINitkmaa	No, I wouldnt do mine that way. But if thats what you want for your wedding then go for it.|`|GvamTVqAaa	I will say it again - it is VERY selfish to have your wedding on a holiday.  Christmas Eve IS a holiday.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Depends on how close it was to my home. Within an hour's distance? Yes. Any further?

First of all she goes around and talk to your friends that dont even know her then she tells you about guys she likes around you but doesn't like them (it dont make sense) you cant like someone and not like them. Anyways on the bright side she does tell you how she feels and tells you nice things she would tell a person she likes. So to answer your question I think she does but only you know because you are around her.

But she is probably waiting for you to make the first move, because she is most likely feeling the same trepidation about you.

Don't live life with regrets, so I say just tell her how you feel! :D Good luck!!|`|C9q81T1Xaa	It sounds to me that she likes you; however, women can be extremely confusing, even to themselves.  Ask her if she want to go out sometime, and see where it goes from there.  Let her know that you are interested, not desperate.  Her feelings will come out once she feels secure.|`|u0OuE30Kaa	Ya she does just ask her out already, but watch out because if she is already looking deeply into ur friendship and other aspects of ur life she could be super nose and very protective, always watching yo u and spying, looking threw ur stuff. So just be careful, but if you like her and don't think so go for it.|`|PriXdRVZaa	aww you're sweet- you'd make a good boyfriend for this girl :D i believe she does hun. good thing you noticed these things too! usually guys are totally oblivious to this kind of stuff... go for it!! good luck sparky!
7gH7sgi6aa	In terms of etiquette I think your Mother was wrong and right.  Your Sister broke the camera, and there was nothing that could have been done about it.  Your Sister should have apologized to you properly and your Mother should have replaced the camera and taken the money out of any allowance or any money your Sister had.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|KLZGmyL4aa	yes u have the right to be upset, i would be upset too, i would probably slap her, everytime she cried when asked how she broke it. lol|`|42tNVOUDaa	If ur upset and angry, be upset and angry, induldge in it. Seriously Id be mad at my sister if it was the same senario as that. She shud like buy you a new one or something...<br>  And why does she get to act like a drama queen when you're the one with a broken camera?<br>  <br>  Sorry I just felt like moaning with you on that one...

Awesome pick.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I don't really like carrie underwood, but whatever floats your boat.lol. For our first dance, I am going to use I wanna grow old with you-Adam Sandler (The Wedding Singer.)

HHB9LUqiaa	You should be happy - what you have sounds amazing!!!<br>  i think i am the one who is not normal<br>  ages - me 25; him 27<br>  we have been married 3 years as of last week<br>  No, we do not spend most of our time together... well maybe.. i mean when were not at work we are usually together, but i guess that can be more detailed in the next question.<br>  when were both at home we are usually doing separate things; ie: im cooking or doing laundry or washing dishes and he is watching TV - when im done with whatever i was doing i usually watch TV with him, but we dont usually even sit next to each other....<br>  most of the time no we dont go to bed together - he has to get up way before me so he goes to bed before me<br>  so i bet by now you can guess the answers to the next two questions.. are we affectionate.. yeah not so much, i dont like the way he kisses, and when hes off for a few days he dosnt shave even if i ask him to.. then i really dont like to kiss him bc its all scratchy and awful...<br>  so on to our nonexistant sex life... it happens about once a month.. but even then its a conversation.. like oh hey by the way we havnt had sex in a while.. maybe we should give that a try.. <br>  <br>  so dear id say keep doing what your doing - trust me you dont want to get yourself in this hot mess that ive gotten in to...|`|AA11596133	Married 15 years, I am 53, he is 49.  We are avid motorcycle riders, and we like to go riding and shop and have lunch somewhere while our kids are in school. When home, we work on cars together, play games with the kids, play video games, talk.  I really like to draw, he likes TV (I do not).  He does not like to be alone, I love it. NO, we do not go to bed together very often because he has very bad sleep disorder problems and I snore like a truck.  I am more affectionate than I used to be, he is OK - could be better.  When we have sex, it is the bomb - that is half the reason I married the guy!|`|F4k68ilkaa	On a typical night where neither of us have a work obligation, we're usually together.<br>  <br>  We'll go exercise pretty much as soon as we get home from work (we live next to a lake - he runs and I skate). After that, we go home, and usually start on dinner together. We'll cook together, eat together, take a shower together, and then chill out watching TV, movies, talking, having a drink, whatever. <br>  <br>  Unless the other is just stupid tired and wants to go to sleep at 8 or something, we go to sleep together. I'd say we probably have sex 3-4X a week, and it's usually very good. We are a very affectionate couple, and there is lots of cuddling/kisses and hugs, and things like that. I also think we communicate well, and I consider him to be my best friend. <br>  <br>  We hang out with our friends too, but since most of our friends are either married or in serious relationships, we wind up hanging out as a foursome. <br>  <br>  I'm 25, he's 28, we've been together 2 years and are getting married in 3 months.|`|IvMPh09baa	im 27 he is 30, almost 31<br>  married 1.5 years<br>  we work opposite schedules, so we only have 3 evenings a week to spend together<br>  yes, when home we are together watching a movie, eating a meal, playing with the dog, talking, sleeping... but on regular days, he comes home late nite and watches tv, plays video games, surfs the internet while I am asleep<br>  yes, we got to bed together only 3 nites a week, though :(<br>  yep... love snuggle time!<br>  sex life is good, when we actually have time to have sex... we are opposite schedules so working sex in can be difficult at times.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	- me 34 / him 38<br>  - 13 years<br>  - Yes<br>  - I want to say 50/50 depending on the night but usually we spend a couple of hours together at the end of the evening - most nights after work it's dinner, clean up, get our daughter off to bed - then our time<br>  - No, my husband is out on injury from work so he's on those "off" hours now (I wouldn't want the injury, but I'd kill for that much time at home!)<br>  - At home more so than when we are out<br>  - 2 to 3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Your ages: I am 46, and she is 43.<br>  <br>  How long you've been married: 22 years<br>  <br>  Do you spend most of your time together?  When I'm not at work, yes.<br>  <br>  If you're both home, are you TOGETHER or doing separate things?  Both.  When I get home, I like to go into my cave and play Madden on the PS2 for awhile.  However, we usually watch at least an hour or two of TV together.  And, we don't just watch it, we pause the DVR and take breaks to talk about it, like who we hope gets to stay on American Idol and why, for example.<br>  <br>  Do you go to bed together?  Essentially, yes.  We don't usually go to bed at exactly the same minute, but close.  Apparently, I need less sleep than my wife does, though, so sometimes she's asleep when I get there.  However, she never complains when I snuggle up next to her, even if it wakes her up a little bit.<br>  <br>  Are you affectionate?  Quite affectionate.  We kiss and hug and say we love each other every day.  Spontaneous hugs and cuddles are common.<br>  <br>  How's your sex life?  Pretty good, although interest on her part seems to be waning, or else I'm not initiating as assertively as I used to - my jury is still out.  Sex certainly hasn't gone out the window, because we still have it twice a week or so.  However, we don't place the same emphasis on it as we did when we were younger, which I'm thinking is probably pretty natural.  I certainly don't feel deprived, and neither does she, so it's all OK.|`|svzGz9STaa	Your ages: 42 and 50<br>  How long you've been married: 4 years<br>  Do you spend most of your time together? No, she works night shift 3 days a week<br>  If you're both home, are you TOGETHER or doing separate things? Depends, she has to sleep most of the day, so on weekends, for example, while she's sleeping I'm puttering around the house being quiet<br>  Do you go to bed together? maybe once or twice a week<br>  Are you affectionate? Pretty much. Hold hands a lot.<br>  How's your sex life? Not bad. Comes and goes.|`|kbz5S3waaa	well during the week, we both get home from work around the same time, i cook and he eats, we watch a movie or some tv together, we go to bed together, we wake up together (he starts getting ready for work, i get ready for the gym) i head off to the gym, he heads off to work, when i get back from the gym, i make the bed and get ready for work. And then on the weekends, we spend most of the time together, going to stores, people watching, going to dinner, every once in a while we have people over, or we go somewhere else together, but hardly any down time from each other - once ever few months we'll do something with just a friend, not together. We've been together for 5 years, married 2.5, i'm 21 he's 22. And our sex life at the moment is a little lacking, as we're a little worried about some upcoming events and it's causing stress.|`|POHWTDPRaa	- I am 35, she is 32<br>  - Been married 7 years<br>  - One of us will be out doing our own thing once a week, every 10 days or so. We are usually at home and we are usually together on weekends. She is a stay at home mother so on weekdays her day ends when I come home. After dinner she'll be reading or doing some little crafty thing while I'm on baby duty and doing chores.<br>  - We go to bed together 3, 4 nights out of the week. She goes to bed before I do the rest of the time.<br>  - We're affectionate. Little kisses and hugs here and there. Typical stuff.<br>  - Sex life is not prefect but certainly not bad. Overall, we are both happy with the quality and frequency.

EL0wq4Zmaa	im very sorry. i think the best thing to do is tell someone. that is not right for him to do that to you. i really think you should talk to your mom first, and if that doesnt work talk to another relative. Again, if that doesnt work you need to tell someone else. like a counselor or a teacher. you should not be hit or talked to like that. no one is perfect and it sounds to me like he has some SERIOUS issues that hes taking out on you. please tell someone. pleaseee. nobody should have to go through that. <br>  <br>  your in my prayers.|`|AA11806606	O.K. so what are you doing to solve this problem.  Why not try and listen to your parents and do things ahead of time so these problems don't happen.  Everyone in today's economy is stressed out with lack of money or work coming in.  I'm sure your parents are probably having a hard time now and anything that you can do to help out would be greatly appreciated.  For the next few weeks, think about having your room clean, and ask them if there is anything they would like done to show your good intentions.  Hopefully things will get better.|`|TRrTunqvaa	if you really wanted to get out of the situation, you would tell the guidance counselor, because what your father is doing is child abuse, and ive kicked my father out my house for something not even as bad as that. they will help. and its pretty easy to do it too|`|AUagSXp0aa	Don't put up with it! That's abuse and no one deserves to be treated that way. Talk to your mom first about how you feel, but if she is being treated the same way and your discussion falls on deaf ears, run to a neighbors and call the police! It WILL be a very tough decision to make, so make sure that when you do it, it feels right to.

gG2CuoF8aa	he would probably think its weird.<br>  maybe a friend of one of your friends knows him, or a cousin of a friend knows him lol.<br>  <br>  or you can try on facebook. <br>  :)|`|pb67BJ61aa	just ask around and see if any of your friends or anyone you know knows him.. then ask them to introduce them to you.<br>  <br>  this happens all the time to me and atleast one of my friends knows them so give it a try.
qFSWTqB0aa	apparentely there is lack of communication on her part. it is not right of her to just get online and be mad at you. if you seriously have no idea then send her a message because if you do it via aim she is less likely to respond.<br>  <br>  send an email telling her that you have no idea what is going on. she might not write back right away, but give it time.<br>  <br>  as for everyone else..well do you tend to talk alot when your nervous or are you shy? bc either one of those will make people avoid you or not say hello. make an effort to talk to them and try to compliment at least 2 people a day. when you step out to greet someone they will most likely reply. <br>  <br>  also. if you know someone is actively involved in sports or clubs  or anything like that, then ask them how thats going and when the next game is . this will show you care about their lives.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!!!|`|KbRCIJOvaa	she probably doesnt have a reason to be mad she probably just jealous of you.and has unexpressed anger,or she has no life and is trying to start drama.or maybesomeone is running their mouth behind your back to her.|`|lX1zpaoAaa	Wow that is a tough situation to be in. The same thing happend to me when all my friend completely stopped talking to me last year and the same thing happend this year when my friend stopped talking to me cuz she thought she was too good.

They will see that you don't care and will feel stupid.|`|RYTJ0pyDaa	=(  I know how you feel, with the friend thing, my friend last year(that I've known since, last year) but we became really close friends because we are(still in) the same g.s troop. So now she is not talking to me (and hasn't said more then a sentence to me) since September. I think she is wrong about not talking to me, I will post it on here as a question and let people decide who is wrong for saying what. <br>  * as for school I would just try to talk to other people, maybe in lunch, just try to be more social with people who you know are friendly people. My mom told me this along time ago, 'You should always have more then one friend, so that way if something happens between you two, you have someone else.' At first I did not try to but now, I have some really great friends.<br>  * as for your best friend. TRY to think of things that happened today that might have upset your friend.  Ummm don't do what I did, which would be half-lying. ex: I did not want to tell her the truth about something dumb, I/ming her dad and asking how he was doing. (when she was not talking to me)  I wanted to know how she was doing and everyone else, because her mom was sick and their dog recently died. (kill me for trying to be nice). So then she unblocked me and went "Y DID U I/M MY DAD?" and I half lied I said "My mouse on my laptop scrolled to your dads name and clicked on it as I typed  'HI! How are you?' " To someone I added which is true, because my laptop does occasionaly tend to i/m someone else, because of me tapping the mouse pad while it is on the buddie thing. So, now she does not talk to me. (its so annoying)     anyway, I don't know how much of a help this is, but I hope this was some help.
0HGqGJYTaa	I know how you feel. I have a drama queen best friend too. They can be exhausting to deal with. She's gonna feel like you betrayed her because you didn't tell her and how can she trust you right? Although, this is very petty, and it's not that you did anything TO HURT her, but TO her it's the principle. However, she's not your mother and not your boss, so just be a woman. They don't like it either way. Also, common sense probably told her that more was going on b/w you and Omar, if she really knows you and can read b/w the lines, so that should help a little. If she remains your friend, just know you're not gonna hear the end of it. She'll throw it in your face unlesss you TEACH her to respect YOU. IF she cuts you off for that, you'll be sad at first, but thankful later. And, You don't need a friend who's so judgmental, because really who cares? It's YOUR man. Just tell her, and if she can't respect it, oh well. Seriously, life is too short. Tell her maybe you would have told her sooner provided that you don't feel like your walking around on egg shells!|`|EdidZdtlaa	casually bring up omar and something that you guys did and then she'll be like whos omar and then you'll be like my bf didnt i tell you? i must have forgotten or something like that|`|TpLnA012aa	Why are you hiding that from her, i dont get it? Why would there be dramaaa?!  Just tell her face to face, its better than leaving it for longer than its already been|`|TfOfVRYnaa	That's dumb. Just tell her. And why would this create drama? Whatever, just tell her. And why did you feel the need to tell us their names? Like wtf??|`|qNujuQJ5aa	Tell your BFF that he is your boyfriend and that you really like him because the longer you keep the secret the more angry she will be and the more she'll question everything you say. If she cantbe happy for you then she isnt really a good BFF.|`|HaRVuFCOaa	Well I think you should tell her that you have a boyfriend. Don't be afraid to tell her.If she is your real BFF she shouldn't get mad that you hid it from her.|`|SVyvqLIiaa	Best thing to do is be truthful! you shoulda told her frist thing, but now its been year she will most likly be unxderstanding so tell her!|`|KJiXs4yraa	TELL HER|`|UBqO5cctaa	sorry but i dont get why you dint just tell her? is it like "bad" to have a bf er somethin? im sooo confuzeddd :/|`|evEJxv06aa	tell her to meet you in the park and tell her everything before it's too late right.|`|YJCG2kn1aa	your not being a bad friend...<br>  if she hasn't asked you who it is, she obviously wont mind.. just tell her.. dont be afraid.

7gH7sgi6aa	I would agree that if you want to play an extra circular activity that they should pay or help pay for it but $450 is an awful lot of money for a school activity and I would think the school is out of line asking for that much money because there are a lot of parents who cannot afford to pay that.<br>  As far as car insurance, it all depends on your families budget.  If they can afford to pay for car insurance then if they do it for one, they should do it for everyone.  Fair is fair.  I've never believed in playing favorites or doing more for one than the other.<br>  I always paid for my kids school trips, I felt that was just a part of school and a part of learning and adventure but I commend you on saving up the money to go to England yourself.<br>  I think you and your parents need to sit down and discuss what is going to be paid for and how.  Everything has to be fair, what is done for one child needs to be done for another.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|tCiVuFK9aa	My guess is if they cut you off in the first place that it was for a pretty good reason.  And remember your parents don't owe you anything.  They are only responsible for seeing to your basic needs. You say that they pay for your brother's insurance but you don't say if he broke any of the rules or didn't do his chores.  If he isn't guilty of any of these, why should he be punished?  I think the best thing to do here is to set down with your parents and discuss exactly what it is they expect from you and how you can get back on the good side.  I'm sure most parents out there would tell you that they have used this sort of discipline also.  Next time do as you are told.  Worse come to worse go get a job and earn it just like your parents do.<br>  Red|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Figure out your priority and don't expect that your parents will come through. <br>  <br>  If the trip to England is important save for that. Insurance has to be the second priority. No exception. Baseball is an extra. Forgo the baseball and save for the insurance. We all have to make difficult decisions in life. <br>  <br>  I would be so mad If I were your parent and I found out you spent your insurance money on baseball and then you expected me to fix your mistake. And I probably wouldn't fix it.|`|oKExTm8paa	Well, it sounds like you made them really mad. You are not completely innocent, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Go and talk to them quietly. Apologize for your behavior and ask if they will reconsider paying for softball.<br>  <br>  Sound like they are pretty good to you if they paid for a car for you.|`|6KS1YfvEaa	probably they have a money problem and cant afford it or something|`|5VokYzZjaa	yep 2 jobs have fun

QCfOUgxnaa	Yep- he's a great singer and I LOVE IT!!!  I love listening to him sing along to the radio, or just sing to himself, and especially when he sings to me.  And I LOVE LOVE LOVE when he wrote me a song.  Nothing more romantic than that!  :)|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	The hubby plays guitar....he knows the beginning to every song you can think of, but none all the way through! It is nice to hear him playing, but I hate it when he tunes the guitar (that gets annoying). He did write me a song once (just joking around, when we first started dating) called, "You sure do got a purty mouth" . It made me laugh!|`|IvMPh09baa	Yes... when he farts he tells me that the opera is in town, and that he got me tickets.<br>  <br>  hear it... well I dont have much choice.<br>  <br>  write me songs... no, i believe whatever comes out is just part of the show.<br>  <br>  makes me laugh though :)|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	He plays some guitar and has a decent singing voice.<br>  Except when he has headphones on and can't hear himself...then he's terrible! He wrote a song for me, but it's instrumental.<br>  <br>  I love when he sings love songs to me.|`|9yurQ85Eaa	My husband is in a band he plays guitar and sings!!! I love it and support him all the way!!! And he has written me a few songs!!!|`|MhyuXBoEaa	My husband plays the drums and guitar and is really good at the drums and I do like to watch sometimes but sometimes it is really annoying because he will have the ipod on so he can't hear the drums but I hear what sounds like the same beat over and over again. He is playing along with songs on the ipod so of course to him it makes sense but annoys the rest of the house. He is pretty good about only playing between the time he gets home and i get home or shortly there after.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	My late husband played bass guitar and was the lead singer in a band here in the mountains of NC.  He passed away June 19th 2008.  I loved to hear him sing and play.  He has a CD out, and the band CD.  He had me finish learning keyboard and I started playing in the band and singing too.  I wrote an entire album, which they play on the radio in NC, TN, WV, KY, VA, and GA.  I am now working on my second CD.  I gained a greater appreciation of music from knowing him and I will always love him for that.  <br>  My man now doesn't play an instrument or sing, but he loves it when I play the piano and sing.  He sits and listens with a smile on his face and love in his eyes.  He is very supportive.  And never give up a God given talent for someone else, you will come to resent them.|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	No.....I have the talent. I sing. Although, I do think he played the trumpet for a while when he was a kid. My husband won't recognize my talent. Every time, I say that I'm going to karaoke when he's home, he finds an excuse to leave or goes to sleep. Although I think I'm talented, I know he hates when I sing, so I use it as payback for things he does that p*ss me off. Revenge is so sweet. muuuhahaaaha. evil laugh. LMAO.<br>  <br>  p.s. well revenge isn't my only reason for karaoking, when he's not home, I do it because singing releases endorphins in the brain, which makes me a happier person. :)|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	No my sweet baby doesn't play any instruments<br>  Wish i could get her to learn to play the in flute though.<br>  But we are perfect for each other anyway|`|WJZPgXzoaa	No but i play 1 he!! of a skin flute, just ask him lol|`|dqMf8IeCaa	i can play his rusty trombone|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	He has no musical talent whatsoever.<br>  <br>  I can play violin.
vXuiXF0taa	Ok, the most probable explanation:<br>  <br>  He liked you at first.<br>  At the party, you guys were flirting im guessing.<br>  The mood got elevated and his hormones kicked in.<br>  This made him ask you to hang over the weekend.<br>  And it also made him kiss u.<br>  But he changed his mind when his hormones went back to normal, then he was kinda rude about it.<br>  Now he is just trying to increase his ego by making you still like him.<br>  <br>  Soo ignore him fer now, look around the field.<br>  Its not that bad, at least you weren't completely lead on, at least he kissed you.<br>  Its no offense to you, its just you and him aren't right for each other?|`|Ob6m9z4oaa	Well at da start it sounds like he likes u! May-b hes shy. Message him on facebook, just b like hey hows u nt spoke in a while. Hope all is gud? C wot u get bk. Gud luck!<br>  <br>  Help wiv my question plz<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgvR5y8VxfxlBk2xBA2xefTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304112640AAz8rzk">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|fhTCOYZMaa	He sounds like he's not worth the air he breaths.<br>  He likes feeling special that someone likes him, but doesn't actually want to do anything about it.<br>  Or he likes you but he's just being a prick.<br>  Either way...|`|0ucm3dmyaa	Sounds like he likes you but is also confused. Seems to me he might not be sure if you like him or maybe he has a hard time figuring out something for you guys to do so he is procrastinating making plans. Maybe his feelings have changed also. Talk to him and if it feels right suggest something to do just as friends until he is ok with everything that is going on again.|`|07prVOz9aa	he probalbly didnt call because he forgot, or he was buesy, and when u said "who is this" he probably thought you forgot about him and he was probly hurt, cuz he really liked u, (thats y he kissed u)  and so he didnt wanna tlk to u for a while and when he comments you on facebook its cuz hes finally ready to tlk to u again, but not all at once, he needs to take it slowly.
GzvLG6x5aa	Sounds like he has more personality than character.  And.. at the end of the day, you can't "make" a person love you more. <br>  If he doesn't love you enough by now, nothing but a major internal shift inside of him is going to change that. Maybe. <br>  Someone who's fun to be around.. is fun to be around, but that is very different to what is required to journey through life. It looks like you are the one shouldering all the burdens just so that you can have someone who says the right things occasionally. <br>  Over time you may well find that that's too high a price to pay and, given your current question, it seems that that feeling has started to seep in already.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	i don't get your question.....<br>  <br>  you want him to love you more yet you are happy?|`|ATyHswTTaa	Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have!!|`|conIxGUsaa	Glad you really love him. You cannot make him love you more. I'm happy he makes you happy, but obviously the doubt is seeping in concerning him not working to at least help with your income, otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question. I was once the breadwinner in my family with a charismatic husband. Trust me, once kids get in the  picture that game gets old real fast. He needs to do something, go to school, get a job something.|`|LZSTaYTiaa	You can't force someone to love you?  PS he should at least try to get a job even if its part time but that's just my opinion.
277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	Obviously he still likes you, and the relationship had fond memories that he wants to keep. Its like a keepsake or a souvenir. Just because you go somewhere and bring back souvenirs doesn't mean you plan to go back there, it just means you're happy you were there and wants something to remind you of it.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I believe that some one could get in a lot of trouble for exploiting pics of other people. I'd let him know that before he tried any funny business.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He is up to something mischievous.|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	If you are splitting up, why worry?|`|6zqocFpqaa	he might put your picture up sumwere and say dont go near this girl or somthin :S maybe im just paranoid but why else wud he do it and why did you wake up next to him anyway if you had split up?? xx|`|SXS2Gf72aa	Something to remember you by?|`|0EUBc2hRaa	that's completely weird. Don't let him take the pictures... Dump him and run|`|Jpg56xBcaa	Are you two staying friends?<br>  if so, he might have been having a laugh about it!|`|8a20c45048431e7cdba59623ee1b83f2aa	he sounds like an *** to me love x|`|IAlFjGwUaa	he is either being friendly or just being a jerk|`|AuCnM6Qoaa	He's planning on sell you pictures|`|fVMzCP5raa	That's a bit weird :S<br>  If your unhappy tell him to delete it.
7pPiKNfHaa	Been there, done that. I hate it when a guy doesn't apologize for something awful he did. I would never ask for an apology, but really in my head I am begging him to apologize, because in those moments of fighting and tears they really miss you. They want you to say sorry to show how much you care for them.<br>  <br>  If you leave a note or say sorry , you'll have her back in no time.|`|AA11766809	Yes, you should apologize. You told her that she "didn't mean anything" to you...that was too harsh, don't you think? Switch places and think. <br>  Colaterally, she needs to be more secure about herself, that is,  if you don't give her reasons not to (like flirting with her girlfriends !). Don't break a heart if you have the alternative not to! Life is soooo beautiful! <br>  Love+respect>>>>all other things will come.|`|vPAftdO7aa	You're not a horrible person, you were upset. I think you should go to her and apologize and explain to her how much she means to you. Apparently right now she's feeling a bit insecure about you, you need to strengthen her trust and make her feel like she's yours.|`|0nNei8Traa	I think you should have apologized. Work it out. No you aren't a horrible person you were upset and angry, people say things. You've admitted you were wrong to say them as well. Do something that she likes and is important to both of you and then apologize|`|3oXe58bfaa	aww apologise and talk things tghrough without arguing and hug her and tell her how much you mean to her!:)<br>  <br>  <br>  dont loose something that means alot to you mate <br>  <br>  <br>  hope things go well!!!!!!!!!:D|`|WxX1Rwwbaa	yes you should apologize that way you have a girl-shes not mad at you-and not sounding nerdy or anything but it might improve your grades- hope i can be helpful bye!|`|6U607PUqaa	i think you should b/c that would show her that you care and dont want to loose her|`|pjrRbgnIaa	yes|`|YxABWksZaa	girls need that kind of thing, you shouldve done it even if you think that it is the wrong thing to do. she is your girlfriend.|`|0dbwA1dVaa	Yeah, it would probably be good if you apologized. Somebody has to be the bigger person if you want your relationship to work, and it sounds like you're going to have to be that person.<br>  <br>  Good luck & God bless.<br>  :]|`|O7eAkeBhaa	Maybe you should get her gifts and apologize. No you are not a horrible person. She yelled at you too so its not your fault at all. Tell me how it works out and good luck.|`|7abc8a12212468a52586c2c62d6edd72aa	You both were wrong and should admit it or lose each other forever.|`|tT4zaIDUaa	YES sorry|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	no both of u were wrong

Do not be too clingy! Girls hate that. Show her that you care about her. This doesn't necessarily mean taking her out somewhere nice but showing her that you are thinking about her in the most random moments. For an example, get her a small gift on a random day. <br>  Also, be creative. Some girls like the whole romantic movie/dinner thing but I am more of the fun type. I like going to the beach or an amusement park. You can tell this by observing her actions. If she laughs a lot, take her to the amusement park. If she flirts a lot and is very social, take her to the dinner. <br>  HOPE I COULD HELP!|`|6Lv5HTevaa	well in every good relationship you have to always be honest.  also dont act like a jerk to ur gf when ur around ur friends it rele pisses girls off.  dont ever forget her birthday and other special days and when she insists on u not gettin her anything for her birthday, christmas, valentines day etc get her something other wise shes gonna b pissed when she finds out tht u didnt get her anything.  dont ditch her for ur friends and b sensitive to her emotions.  in every relationship u hav to give and take, so b open to compromises and dont b self centered<br>  hope i helped|`|gRXy66dOaa	treat her good and take her out|`|07prVOz9aa	be sweet, tell your girlfriend shes beautiful, respect her, give her presents because u feel like it (like stuffed animals and stuff) let her no u stilll like her. wen u guys are walking, just take her hand and hold it, dont always try to make out with her, if ur sitting on the couch or something, just cuddle with her/|`|4GUZV7fpaa	Basically just treat her like shes the only one that matters :)<br>  <br>  I think its adorable when a lad texts you in the mornin sayin 'good mornin' or sumfin as you wake up, and then at night time wishin you sweet dreams or whateverr lol<br>  <br>   but thats just me, give it a try tho :P|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	cheat on her lol|`|NGBP65luaa	the three golden rules, listen to this because its right<br>  <br>  1.

5OXtsCv1aa	No offense but, how can your marriage be so great without having sex? This is a very intimate way men and women express their feelings, connection, affection, attraction and grow closer in love. <br>  <br>  Yet, he is denying you so often you posted this question here. If your husband doesn't have a medical condition to explain his loss in desire then he has lost interest in you and doesn't want to hurt you by telling you or he maybe cheating. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to rule out the medical condition and the picture should become clearer. If everything is fine why do you keep winding up back at this point of frustration? I believe for a spouse to deny their partner it can be emotionally abusive. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Love life after 20 years:  We are now both 46.  We are both still really into each other emotionally and physically.  We have sex twice a week, but that is our compromise between me (high drive) and her (low drive).  This may be a bit more blunt than you want:  <br>  <br>  Before we married I told my wife that we BOTH needed to commit to staying fit for life because marriage was for life and I am not attracted to fat women.  We have also encourage each other to exercise in a nice way, like I will ask her to come with me when I give the dogs a nice 3 mile walk, or she will ask me to come with her when she walks them.  We are always nice about it, like if the other person really is dead tired, no pressure.  Same with eating healthy, we encourage each other in a nice way, I have NEVER in any way conveyed any negative emotion toward her for what she does choose to eat.<br>  <br>  If we were both fat I just don't know how much impact it would have.  I think it might greatly reduce my desire.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I was 32 when I got married.  Never had a roommate or live in girlfriend.<br>  <br>  I married a woman who was 39 - she had been married for 8 years, divorced for 8 - and then met me.<br>  <br>  Package deal - I got her and 2 teenage kids.<br>  <br>  Have now been married more than 24+ years.  We get together 2-3 times per week.  And in most get-togethers, she counts higher than 3.  If I don't ask for sex, she does.<br>  <br>  I'm now 57.  And she is 61.  I've put on 10 pounds since getting married (now 6'1" and 190 pounds).  She has put on about 35 pounds.  I pretend not to have noticed.  But I never say anything negative about the weight.<br>  <br>  When I was in my 30's we had a more active sex life.  We were also going thru the stress of 2 teenagers and 2 sets of aging parents with health problems and the usual issues at work.<br>  <br>  BUT THAT WAS US.<br>  <br>  Its really a issue of each person has their own rate or level of sex that they want or desire.  Seems like you are still interested and for some reason, he's not interested.  <br>  <br>  Why?<br>  <br>  There were times, when my office was downsizing from 127 to 20 people, within 2 years - that I didn't want sex with my wife.  I just wanted to be left alone.  But she still wanted sex, so we continued at about our normal pace.<br>  <br>  I would suggest talking to him and just tell him, you enjoy being held and having sex.  It makes you feel better (it does, it releases hormones that promotes a feeling of well-bring).  If he is still not interested ask him why.  And ask him to have a physical check-up.<br>  <br>  At your age, you have a lot of time left to be around, and there is no reason for you to be miserable because you want sex and are not getting it.|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	My husband and I are both in our thirties as well and have a daughter.  Our sex life isn't the greatest but I think we are both just always tired. have you tried initiating it with him?  Maybe he is waiting for you to make the move.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	as we get older womens sex drive goes up and the mans sex drive goes down|`|2lz3w7Pzaa	Good question. I wish there was a simple answer to it. I think that, in most cases, people just grow to where sex isn't as important to them as it once was and the need for it is less. I was married to my first wife for nearly 25 years. Towards the last ten years, I was lucky if I got it twice a year! With my second wife, we did it nearly on a weekly basis. As time went on, it got less and less. Now that I have two wives, it seems that I get it less than ever and you would think that just the opposite would be true. Yet, we are all happy together and the need for sex (for them, anyway) exists less that it used to. Still, I would appreciate something at least on a weekly basis. What to do? I guess that, friends with benefits would work if it fits in your moral limits. If not, then you're at a loss.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	you don't do it cuz you two never have enough alone time.  ahour or two is not enough alone time try spending a intire day by yourselfs with no kids or family or friends or cell phones and no work invovled just you two going out having fun,and being kids again. then the old feelings will come back. it might be hard to do  but you can do it.and then you will do it.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	We are at about the same stage but my wife will not discuss it and she gets very angry.  After years of frustration we are finally going to counseling... so far there are no revelations.<br>  <br>  My wife will not even touch me in bed.  I just want her to put her g*ddamn arm around me once in awhile, and I've told her that, but she will not.  If I try to cuddle with her, she will throw my arm off, and if I persist she will get up and sleep on the couch.  If I go to bed early when she's there reading... she will not even look at me.  Last year, for about 200 nights in a row she rented and watched a violent movie.<br>  <br>  I've asked her a whole bunch of times what is wrong, what can I do, how is she feeling, etc. etc. and she will say nothing.  If I press her on it she will leave the room and stonewall me until I stop talking about it.<br>  <br>  Basically she has terrorized me into bringing home the paycheck and keeping at arms length.  Honestly, I am a nice guy and would do anything for her.  I am very hurt and confused.
nspaGCh9aa	It's ur life not his.  You need to tell him that he can't tell you what to do because you are a grown woman.  Who the hell tells their kids who to date and they are grown.  Good luck.|`|AA11806606	Face the facts kid, your Dad doesn't like Black people and there is nothing you can do to change this.  Move on with your life and hopefully this guy will prove to be a good person and prove that you were correct about him.  However, I presently see many young white girls with babies of mixed races and zero fathers around.  I sincerely hope this doesn't happen to you.  Mixed marriage have a difficult time in today's society and have a hard time from the start.  Good Luck.

If he is tired or stressed and doesn't want sex fine, and then maybe your loving touch will initiate sex.  But don't assume cheating just because he hasn't wanted sex lately.  There are a lot of other signs to look for for that.  Try initiating it and then talk about it.  Communication is a lot better than suspicion.<br>  Red|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Well at least you have a clue.<br>  <br>  Yes he's cheating and having wild passionate sex with his mistress.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	Honorable Elijah Muhammad through Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan teach us<br>  <br>  Human beings procreate because of the attraction between male and female. A woman that covers herself is not trying to attract a man on base principles. Women have had enough of men being attracted to them because of the beauty of their forms, face and hair rather than the ( intelligence ) of a creature of God that He created for a serious purpose.  A virtuous woman is more precious than silver and gold <br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new. is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that (God) desires for His creation. <br>  <br>  She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building.  Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come. <br>   In holy Quran and Bible - A woman is three-times the value of a man, because she brings forth life. Women teach and train the offspring. So, if you are an ignorant, unlettered and foolish woman, you will make a foolish people(generation).  But the scriptures say GOD will raise foolish people or a people lost knowledge of GOD. Love in the truest sense of the word is not an emotional feeling toward our<br>  mate. Love is the force or power generated from acting on the principles of truth.<br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of  (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness<br>  Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. <br>  <br>  Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.  GOD is best knower !|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	Might be work pressures/stress.

Next question!|`|514fe92d3b5ee587bad2e6c4029a3b3baa	If he is then it's something he is lacking at home.This what you do. Go purchase some nice lingerie paired with some fierce pumps. Now when he go into the room for bed go change quick. ( you don't him falling asleep) While you in the restroom change let him know that you need to have a conversation  with him and ask him to cut out the t.v. When that's done walk out with the sexiest strut you can muster up.( he will be looking like a deer in headlight by know) Then proceed to give the best oral that he can imagine. ( make his toes curl!!) Then you can finish stating "let him know he will never find a woman likeme"  then simply turn over and go to sleep on his ***.After thta if he won't attempt to get some sex then, yeah he cheating. So you need to step up your game!|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	well if he doesn't initiate, then why can you? you have the right to have sex with him WHENEVER you want and if he doesn't respond to you then you let him know that you will get it some where else.

If a lack of sex is the only reason you suspect he'd be cheating you just don't have much of a marriage anyway. Where's the trust. He could be having a health issue.|`|JnXmSLDfaa	Either he is cheating or he's  seriously depressed.|`|ZEitfScGaa	He could be depressed, he could be cheating, he could be into porn. You have to talk to him.|`|tb0NMaooaa	just because theres a feeling, doesnt mean anything. are there any weird going on?....theres so little info here to help you|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	If he is working long hours or stressed on the job. Court him like you did before you got married.|`|IFraOYwRaa	Just ask him if he is cheating on you.  But he may not, because you are not the one withholding.  When women withhold sex, they are practically telling their husband/boyfriend to cheat.<br>  <br>  The Italians have a saying "men want a whore in the bedroom and lady in the living room."   In simple terms, Men are can get bored after doing the same thing time and time again. They like variety and like to be entertained. So don't be shy about trying out things or telling him that you want to do some funky stuff. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, men are visual creatures so maybe you could try spicing things up a bit like trying some sexy outfits, heels, maybe some bondage, role-playing, etc.<br>  <br>  The point is to get his attention.  My ex-girlfriend never got that idea and even now is having trouble with her husband having wandering eyes.

Had to have sex minimum of 3 times a week and then suddenly notting.  after the 3 weeks were up, I knew something was wrong as I had been with him for 20 years and this never happened before - sex was very high priority and then he told me he no longer loved me.  No reason just no longer loved me.  3 months later I discovered he had been cheating on me with an old school friend whos going through a divorce.  Maybe not in your case but.....  there was a lot of texting before hand - I thought it was his male friends.  I too always though he loved me. but not so...<br>  my 3 kids and I am devastated.<br>  Now i want a quick divorce to wash that man out of my hair.|`|AA10178644	Not much information in your question but I would suspect something.

HAk6iROaaa	I live in Sydney and my boyfriend in Melbourne. And it is working, it's been about 5 months. I go to Melbourne every 3rd weekend and cherish those weekends.<br>  Howcome it works for us? We both know it's temporary, we love and trust one another, there is no jealousy involved when we go out with friends etc, what's the big deal? if you are of sound emotional maturity, there simply is no problem. I came here for work, and he could not leave because he had just started a new job. Because I did not feel it was fair to make him move so soon after he started, we decided to do it this way until such time that I could either go back or he could come here to Sydney. it is only a temporary solution, ofcourse we would prefer to be together, and will be one day soon, for sure.|`|t0Z2dpdlaa	mines working for now and it sucks how i cant see him everyday but i cherish every moment we spend together. it just matters about the committment between the 2, not the miles between them|`|eccd862f398f745a83ca00f1e1517e3eaa	I have had many of long distance relationships, they're kind of fun yet annoying.<br>  If you met the person before then when they leave to go back from where-ever they came from, you would want to see that person a lot.<br>  If you never met the person before but over say Myspace.com and just start texting then say "do you wanna go out?" or something like that, its fun at first then gets boring.<br>  Most long distance relationships do not work.

7gH7sgi6aa	Unfortunately for you "no".  Both of you are underage and the Foster Care system is so swamped down with cases they are not going to move her simply to be closer to you and most definitely not so she can "live" with you as that is against the law.  If your parents were willing to adopt her, and she was "allowed" out of her current Foster situation things might be different but that is a lot of "ifs".<br>  Try your hardest to keep your relationship close even those it is long distance.  Use the internet and write letters and send pictures.  Visit if possible but keep the love alive.

q6GnofENaa	For the place setting, get those green blocks of foam that they use for gardening, cut it into little blocks, soak them in water, stick little daisies in them so the entire foam block is covered, and then wrap it with ribbon so it looks like a present.

yNbGq4viaa	Listen, you can't change for anyone because then you become a different person from the one they liked to begin with.  You have to be who you are.  If you know she's sensitive then I would avoid any jokes at her expense, but I would explain to her that you think she's beautiful and tell her the qualities about her that you find so appealing.  I would also tell her that you understand she has been treated badly in the past and you're sorry for that, but you are not those people and you can't make up for what they did.  Explain to her that SHE has to be the one that builds herself up.  You can't do it for her.  Trust me, if she is dead set on feeling badly about herself nothing you do will ever make it better.  If things don't improve then you owe it to yourself to move on.  I have been in this situation before with a man I dated for two years so I know what I'm talking about.  I spent a year of our relationship trying to make him feel better about himself so he'd take some initiative in life and another year trying to get out of the relationship because I felt so guilty.  That's two years of my life I'll never get back.  Don't make the same mistake.|`|tguEmxVyaa	Dump her the world is filled with hot girls.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	Good for you for standing by her and caring enough to try to be sensitive to her issues. Maybe with time, with a good boyfriend like you, she will regain some self esteem. All I can say is keep being a faithful loving boyfriend. I think most guys would've been long gone by now.|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	Hmmmmm<br>  You're in a bit of a pickle.<br>  Everyone suffers from insecurities, but some just have more than others. <br>  You say she's put in a real effort to try to be more confident, but at the same time - it's apparently not enough of an effort for you.<br>  It's still a fairly new relationship, only 3 months. There's still a certain comfort level that you two have to reach.<br>  But it's really just a matter of weighing your options.<br>  On one hand, you care for her and things have worked out enough that you've stayed together for 3 months and she's putting in an effort to change for the better for you.<br>  On the other hand, you don't feel like it's enough of a change and she's still holding back, which is, in turn, causing YOU to hold back the person that YOU are.<br>  So you either hold on, see if things change even more for the better or you let her go so you can be yourself (and, might I mention, have those lovely "what if" thoughts).<br>  I would personally stick it out for a bit longer.<br>  But at the same time, if you stay together for another month or so and she DOESN'T change and it keeps taking its toll on YOU and YOUR personality, you can't very well stay with someone who's going to tear you apart. So you have to stay aware of when that moment happens, if things haven't changed anymore.|`|jTV6rLX3aa	Tell her that you really care for her, that she is the one you want to be with. Tell her that you have a fairly extroverted personality, and you enjoy laughing and hanging out with people--but that you are not interested in a relationship with those people. Tell her you are dating her for a reason and that such suppositions about cheating etc really drain on you. Tell her that it hurts you that she would even suggest such because it is an insult on your character/morals. Tell her that you enjoy talking to other people, but it doesn't mean anything more than friendship. Tell her what you two share is special and that you wouldn't risk loosing it with stupid behavior.|`|u7LSohRyaa	It sounds like you need to just be friends. You aren't looking for a work in progress. You want someone whose got it all together just like you. You're not going to hold it against her that she had a bad childhood but you need someone whose moved on and all that. She can call you when she's ready and then you can try again but nothing heavy duty for now. If she's willing to trust you, you might be willing to quit worrying about her worrying.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	Pretty kickass man, that is funny<br>  <br>  I say continue to be the way you are. If you love her enough, continue to make sacrifices for her. In time she will realise that she has nothing to fear! Give her time mr kickass man|`|o9xn5OnJaa	tell her you will never leave her make every day with her the best day she's ever had|`|0ucm3dmyaa	When you are hanging out like just watching tv or something like that (so she doesn't get all afraid you will dump her if you tell her you need to talk, just say "Hey..."). Talk to her and tell her kinda what you just told us. Let her know you are proud of the progress she has made and give examples, reassure her that you won't break up with her, and explain your difficulty with what is going on is a soft and caring way so she doesn't get offensive. Be sure to add compliments and adoring gestures (kisses on the cheek, holding hands, and even just smiling). She may get upset but in the end she will understand, if she does get upset comfort her and make sure how you act towards her (love and caring ways) don't change.|`|GopaUZOJaa	You shouldn't have to 'walk on eggshells' around your girlfriend, she should be someone you can be yourself around. People who you have to constantly cater to will ware you down and make you be something your not. I'm not saying you should break up, but maybe just talk to her about it, let her know. I know that if i was bothering my boyfriend i would want him to tell me and I'm sure that if you let her know that she was 'grating on you', you both would be better off. Also let her know that you care about her and tell her how great she is, compliments are really good self-esteem boosters.|`|Ig36ec0Baa	You just need to be straight forward with her, tell her flat out she doesn't need to be worried about you breaking up with her but you do have female friends and just because you talk to them doesn't mean anything and shes worried over nothing. And just make sure your not changing yourself, If you don't act like your normal self around her then not only is it not fair to you but also to her. Don't be afraid to be yourself, even if she starts to get upset just tell her thats not what you meant.|`|cj0edEvKaa	Since she has been treated "shitty" by pretty much everyone around her she is already expecting the worst from you!  You seem like a great guy, and it sounds like you really like her, but sometimes its hard for women to feel like they deserve something better when they've grown accustomed to the worst.  It's great that she has improved, but you really need to think about yourself here!  You are changing who you are because she is not comfortable with who SHE is.  So now you have to think about how long you are willing to wait for her to find herself.  Just try not to lose yourself in the process!  Good Luck!|`|nd5w7v4saa	Well,<br>  Even though it sounds like you love her, alot.<br>  It just doesn't seem like your all that happy,<br>  And that's pretty much all that matters.<br>  <br>  Even though she's been treated badly, doesn't mean you have to stick with her, just because of that.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be changing for the worse, if anything your girlfriend should make you better.<br>  <br>  You can't and shouldn't have to change who you've become, it sounds like your walking around on egg shells.|`|pORmp0tfaa	I sort of know what its like to be in your girlfriend's shoes and trust me its not easy. She knows how she is acting and if she could do a complete 180 right away she definitely would. I used to be insecure and have those same sort of issues with my boyfriend too, but it's not a problem anymore. What helped the most for me was him just being open and honest with me, and also telling me when I was being ridiculous. I know you don't want her to get mad at you but she'll respect you if you stand up to her and tell her when her accusations are out of line. Just make her feel loved and special so she doesn't think you want to leave her and eventually it will get better|`|oP6mtiKAaa	reassure her... sounds like she really needs someone in her life like you and hopefully she knows how lucky she is to have you.

TPhIWWniaa	In Illinois the statute of limitation for sexual abuse/assault is 5 years, you would need to check with your state.  My suggestion is for you to get counseling about what happened and for you to suggest to the rest of the women that went through this to do the same thing.  Unfortunately being sexually abused or assaulted has many consequences in the long run.  Unfortunately our government doesn't seem to think that a sexual predator should pay for their crimes years after they've committed their crimes; maybe they think that the survivors "get over it" (as many people ignorantly tend to say) within 5 years.|`|oKExTm8paa	You need to tell your mom or dad about this.

Judges frown on the parent who is keeping the kids from the other parent. If Chris is in a more stable environment that would be better for the kids, the judge could award custody to him and visitation to Pat. Chris should write money orders for support and keep the receipts so he has proof of paying.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Chris is really a stellar dad.

That would be total rejection for them|`|LQISGYbEaa	"At one point her and her kids were without hot water or electricity for almost a month because she couldn't pay the bill..."<br>  Do you think that is a fact favorable to Chris?

Contrary to modern cultural beliefs people don't have to sex because they like each other.  You don't have sex with your female friends, do you? (I mean, I'm assuming you're heterosexual.)  Love him as he is.<br>  <br>  I was married to a man for 29 years and we have 4 grown children.  He knew he was gay when we began dating and he told me so, tho he said he'd never acted on his attraction.  We committed to having a heterosexual relationship and he tried like h--- all those years to be straight.  Eventually, tho, it wore him down and he came close to a nervous breakdown.  Additionally, it effected his ability to be an effective father to his female children.  Now, not every homosexual has issues with women, in particular, but this was his issue and it hurt the women in his life.<br>  <br>  We're much better off divorced.  We don't have any overly-angry feelings toward one another.  I don't have any issues with him as a man, but he should never have married a woman.  <br>  <br>  Love your friend as he is and enjoy the varied qualities he can bring into your life.
Ox9xc9fKaa	dear God, you might hate me - and some others too - when i say this, but it IS true with most men, not all.. you're accommodating waaaaaaay too much to the point you're losing yourself in this. With some men, you've got to be a bit demanding and bitchy for them to respect you. Now if this is not you, i'd leave him asap. but if you can adjust in attitude you'll see he'll change. you've got to be mysterious instead of too predictable and obvious. so what u can do is this: call him at work and say "hey listen, there's no dinner, and i've heard this place blah blah, we're going there tonight" <br>  give him chores, demand that he does them. don't do everything for him. and most of all don't be depressed over this, if it works it works. you deserve to be happy, demand it!!|`|IqcQdvWEaa	just read some of the insensitive answers you have ,take no notice love. try being a bit less forward, what i mean is don't run around after him and dont start thing s in the bedroom cos he will just take you for granted and eventualy make you sad, try make him want you to do things instead of expecting them xx good luck martyn|`|b87ee7794207ceaf35296b9c24769096aa	just divorce the man. there are plenty of men who will love to have you as a wife. i wish my wife would do even 1/5th of what you do for him.|`|conIxGUsaa	You should really start by just talking to him.

Ask him and see what he says.|`|6MmXUZ8Aaa	Wow.. when did the honeymoon end ?|`|IqtzkgyBaa	Honorable Elijah Muhammad through Honorable Minister Louis Farrakahn teach us- <br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of  (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.” It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that  (God) desires for His creation.<br>  <br>   She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building. <br>  <br>  When a man works hard to maintain support, guide and protect his wife and family, what comes up out of his wife is a natural desire to console, comfort and give that man peace and quiet of mind. When you fall in love, it makes you want to serve. You do things to please, whether it be in a meal, the way you fix your home, or the way you fix yourself. You try to make it nice for him because he brought that out of you by being what he is supposed to be. <br>  <br>  God created a woman’s form to be appealing to a man’s eyes. You can call him holy, you can call him divine, you can call him prophet, you can call him saint, you can call him apostle, but if he is a man, your physical form is appealing to his eyes. <br>  <br>  Men cannot guide a woman just with sex, and if a man is dumb enough to think that sex can guide a female that includes female, then the marriage falls apart and the relationship tumbles down. Guidance comes from the brain, not from any other part of the body. Guidance must manifest wisdom and since you are the second self of God, then the man must bring to you wisdom and truth that is from God, because the only thing that can maintain the woman of God is the word of God, rightly brought from a man who is in the image and the likeness of God.   Love in the truest sense of the word is not an emotional feeling toward our mate. Love is the force or power generated from acting on the principles of truth.<br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of  (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness<br>  The true life of marriage is based in the quality of love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. <br>  <br>  Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love. Our true happiness is with GOD, a devorce or breakup is acceptable in case, because GOD is the best knower !|`|538c1fe1a2e40d8a0eeb8046985ef01eaa	Hi you sound like you have become your idea of what you think he wants, almost a Step ford wife.

EV1nUW3Waa	Do you have any department stores or like even a Wal-Mart near you?<br>  <br>  They almost always have gift registrys.<br>  <br>  You should registar. I mean at least give it a try.  Be the first one.  Even if people don't stick to it maybe it will give them ideas.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Hi, I'm from SK. We didn't register at all.<br>  However, most common registries we see are for the Bay and Sears - big variety at both of them. If it strikes your fancy, see if Canadian Tire does one.|`|29I8PWrxaa	What are you asking then?  If you should register?  I am.  We are registering at Wal-Mart, Canadian Tire, and Sears.|`|WzAHKILcaa	I would recommend just doing a small registry at Sears or the Bay or Homesense- anything remotely local. Spread around to your family that you already have most stuff you need- this way they may be more prone to stick to the registry or give cash. No good way to say it politely so registering and spreading the news to immediate family to spread.|`|884v4VhGaa	I'd say don't bother. It's a lot of work, and at The Bay at least, stuff gets discontinued not infrequently, and isn't always easy to find at the store. If no one around where you are ever registers, then no one will use the registry, like you said. Do people generally ask for advice on what to get? Tell whoever will be asked that you have all the things you need, and think of anything you need that you don't have. How about napkins? Extra towels? Etc, etc, etc.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i live in MB and it seems like everyone asked where we were registered.   although i felt like it was asking for gifts, which  i think is rude so i didn't do it.  i can see it's purpose though.  you could register at one specialty store.  although it doesn't matter people will get you things from it and things that aren't on your list at all,|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	were registering through The Bay.<br>  People shouldn't feel obligated to ger you anything , but if they would like to, then they have a good idea as to what you need, versus, what you probably wouldnt use.|`|o23MmGOOaa	I personally would not like to have to buy something off of someones registry. I think you should talk to your mums and bridesmaids as people will often ask them for ideas of what to get you. also I did used to think it was quite rude to have a wishing well, but now I realise how much easier it is just to give cash - especially for people that already live together and have everything. A lot of weddings I have gone to have put in a nice poem explaining this. - look on the web for wedding wishing well poems.|`|uGinKU6Baa	CONGRATS 1st of all<br>  <br>  Try the following:<br>  <br>  The Bay<br>  <br>  Sears<br>  <br>  Wal-Mart<br>  <br>  Zellers<br>  <br>  Canadian Tire
2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	Wow...your story is exactly like mine.  Let me just tell you what I did.<br>  I choose my husband.  I choose my husband because I realized that the other guy was a fantasy.  The other guy treated me like I was a fantasy.  He was always telling me I was perfect and I was beautiful.  But with all this mess I was in I couldn't help but feel like I was far from perfect.  I was hurting two people that I cared about and that was so far from being ok.  I told my family and God that I would love and honor this man and I had to at least give it a shot.  My husband is far from perfect..but he is a good man.  He tries everyday to be a good husband.  <br>  At one point I told my husband that I choose the other man and he moved out and everything.  But once he was gone I missed him horribly.  Since letting the other guy go..I have been ok.  I now know the grass is not always greener on the other side.|`|30f515cdf3875c0a4df5afed4d563a8daa	This is serious matter and I know some things about this. You should be careful if you decide to follow your heart, others have one too. But I think the worse is taking operational advices from the internet. This is a decision you must take on your own and continue to live with it. How many lives are you able to live in parallel?|`|LvTIVjySaa	I don't think you should be with either man.  You are 23, with a child.  I think you should make the child the priority and put your thoughts of a relationship on hold until you have matured more and know what you want.  Provide stability for the child and learn more about who you are and the woman you want to become.  You shouldn't be communicating with the other man, regardless, unless you completely end your relationship and, at that point, you will need legal intervention for visitation and support with the boyfriend you have currently.  You will not make yourself proud, chasing a man behind your boyfriend's back and you certainly wont be setting a good example for your child.  You need to work on you and your child first, at 23, you can afford to wait until you are truly ready.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	You may not be cheating physically but you are still cheating in your heart.

Don't let the thrill of an affair affect your judgment.<br>  If your affair partner knows you are with this man you are probably just a booty call to him.<br>  Clear your head and think long term for your and your child.|`|an7qtWORaa	It sounds like you need to decide to stay in your relationship and stop playing with the idea of cheating or move on with the new guy. You are already messing up your family everytime you contact the other guy. You can't care because you are saying one thing and doing something differnt. You are not going to find total bliss in any realtionship. I just hope you don't jump ship and after your ex finds someone else or you and the new guy have problems and you want to come back. You are already hurting your family they just haven't found out.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Sounds like you have a choice to make and you you can do that.|`|1f333cc1fc67ffacc60cc00afcd82a36aa	Just because you have been with someone for a long time and have a child, doesn't mean you should stay with them.

ypGtH8Rhaa	First off with guys don't assume they just know things like crushes and what not. Shy or not you just got to flat out tell him that you like him. If you haven't done that you seriously need to.<br>  <br>  Then to avoid the situation that just happened you could try just talking to him on the spot with "hey can I talk to you for a second?" get his number and make sure its not one of the rejection hot-line numbers (please see <a href="http://www.rejectionhotline.com/rh-numbers.asp)" rel="nofollow">http://www.rejectionhotline.com/rh-numbe...</a> and then just call him. Sit with him at lunch and talk to him there.<br>  <br>  Theres plenty of different ways to do things, and really unless your crush reads this and supplies you with his answer then your best bet would be to ask him about it.<br>  <br>  All in all, it sounds like your not talking to him because your afraid now and the only way to get over that is to face your fears headlong and deal with them.|`|9XlQdh2Aaa	Hmm.. that's not very nice of him. I'm not sure why he avoided talking to you, maybe he really just didn't want to talk about anything. What exactly did your note say? If it said you like him... and he didn't reply back, then he may not be interested :( If he likes you then he should work on letting you know. I wouldn't sit around and wait for him though, if you have other boys that want to hang out with you, i would hang out with them.

As long as you don't lapse into inane chatter out of nervousness....|`|0HOGn7njaa	ask him what he likes to do what he did last weekend or what hes doing this weekend. tell him you guys never hang out and you should sometime! he'll either get really interested or play it off. if he says yes you could make a suggestion, but you dont have to. most importantly just play it cool! dont be too needy but let him know you would like to spend more time togehter.|`|AK3sPc5waa	Maybe you could talk about something that happened to you(something embarrassing, or crazy). Say some random things that have happened to people. This will stir up the humor, and make him laugh or feel concerned.|`|5XLIPK9Waa	Just talk about something random. Tell him your favorite color or how tired you are. Always works.|`|Txg9UpBOaa	ask him wat kind of music he is in too or ... wat r his hobbies....????|`|Imucuw4Uaa	first of all if you look somewhat attractive you shouldn't be the 1 worrying about what to say, secondly i would just talk about you and then see if he is interested in what you want to do and then you should be like hey we should hang out some time, its all about hanging out once you r in then you can move onto step 2 which going through the bases this shouldn't be too hard, trust me just talk about a bunch of crap and be nice and cool and thats all you have to do, its simple|`|uCQLse9Naa	i've had this problem before..<br>  im sure if he's not making conversation he may<br>  be just as nervous as you are..lol.<br>  ask him whats he doing for the weekend?..things like that..<br>  there are plenty of things to talk about? is he into music?|`|AuFjh1vraa	You should talk to him about his or your family it's always a safe bet. Also you could talk about to him about after school activities.|`|7Xjdv6jRaa	Talk about what you are doing over the spring break/summer.|`|UF64MzAsaa	just make small talk such as family, pets and all that jive but don't get to off task from your school work. Love isn't all you need you also need grades.|`|JGj8TN2saa	talk about things you two have in common talk about things you think are intresting or stuff that he likes|`|2gyV8qLGaa	Be like "so you wanna have some crazy hardcore sex?"<br>  he'll talk|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	Ask him what kind of music he's into.|`|rCZ3NIFhaa	Keep trying to talk to him. <br>  If you are shy, like you said, then gather up your courage. Lets say some kind of football game was on last night. Then you can bring you that. Like, "Wasn't that game great?" Or something like that. But boys hate not being yourself. So, if you don't like sports don't do that conversation. Talk about your family and your day. Then if he doesn't reply try again. <br>  So, once he starts to reply talk about more things you enjoy. If he isn't intrested, he isn't for you.|`|XK0sOxbzaa	I sooo know how you feel. i go through the same thing every day. talking about class is okay. its a start and you both can relate. maybe ask a few questions. not about school, but maybe about a project. or you can, (if you are comfortable) just say something like "oh my god, my cat is soo crazy!" or something. for the example i gave you, maybe he will start talking about his cat and so on. the conversation will start to flow and it will become easier. if you aren't all comforatble saying that, say something about whats happening now. encurouge him to be funny and be funny yourself. just go with the flow. and really listen! it will be easier. Good luck!|`|RIDwzLfaaa	Omg i was soo like that before. Until i took a Speech class in college and read 2 books on how not to be shy...lol...Yeah its funny but it works. Talk about things that interest you. Ask him what's his favorite sport. Girl there's so much you can talk about you just get stuck. Try it little by little. You'll come out of your shell soon. Dont worry =)|`|8dxHozB5aa	ask him what kind of music he likes, if he plays sports (guys love that), what kinds of movies he watches, the weather, or just start the conversation with a funny story about something that has happened to you recently.|`|ZVwvPSNZaa	Ask yourself this very important question:<br>  <br>  WHAT EXACTLY DO I GENUINELY APPRECIATE ABOUT HIM ASIDE FROM HIS LOOKS??<br>  <br>  Once you figure out the answer, sincerely compliment him. If he doesn't appreciate that, he's not human.|`|wppn2xudaa	bring up your period, guys love that|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You don't need to plan your conversation when you are talking to someone you like to talk to. Talk about music, concerts, sports weather, current events, school events, something interesting that happened to you etc. Make sure you give him time to talk while you listen attentively.
pvjZEIDRaa	Honestly, I dated my best friend for like half a year, and it was aweful. It made things so awkward. We never kissed or anything. He told me he was in love with me, but I couldn't return it. In the end I broke his heart but I couldn't lead him on if I didn't feel the same way about him. We are still working out trying to be friends again...it's been about 2.5 months.<br>  <br>  Don't for a second assume that this is what's going to happen to you if you start seeing her!! I'm just saying it's a risk. She may see you as a friend and nothing more, but don't lose her trust. It's hard to gain it back if you lose it. Just take what you can get if you really care about her. Be there for her, and don't put her in a spot where she will feel guilty when it comes to her b/f (aka don't kiss her if you guys have a moment). Keep her trust, and if you feel it's appropriate tell her how you feel. No girl will avoid you if you tell her how you feel...if she doesn't feel the same way then she'll probably tell you, but she won't want to lose you as a friend.|`|NUOIeVdLaa	It is possible, I have the same problem with my best guy friend.I REALLY liked him too. Just remind yourself this, when they break up (I'm like your crush, shy and don't make friends easily) she'll need a shoulder to cry on, and you can comfort her and she might start to like you. Everyone breaks up some time, and if you two are meant to be then it will be. But don't tottaly back off, flirt a little but not to where she knows you like her. <br>  Good Luck!!!

They like a leaner look. You look fine. I would just concentrate on tone and maintenance.|`|Qbczt3ivaa	Well you definitely dont need to bulk up!

Girls do it all the time too.  If a guy or girl is shy, they won't just come up to someone they like.  The next best thing is eye contact.  But, thank god for that, at least.  Eye contact is at least a sign that he's noticing you.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	It is odd since they normally send something, but I'm sure theres a good reason. I would give them a call soon, like in a few weeks to check on them and make sure they are ok. It could be financial troubles you arent aware of.|`|oKExTm8paa	Maybe your grandfather and aunt think you are adult enough to thankfully accept their birthday cards without expecting money. At age 23 you should be making your own money.<br>  <br>  You had plenty of people remember your birthday and you should be thankful. What do you do for your Aunt and Grandfather? Do you call them, write them, visit them? If not, why not. Maybe that's why you got no money. Every relationship should work two ways. You are an adult now. Act it.<br>  <br>  If they gave each you $25.00 for 22 previous birthdays, you earned $1100.00 for just being related to them. Hmmmm. Pretty nice.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	it was a rule in our family to not give gifts to extended family once you're an adult. it's the thought that counts and if your card was sent with love that's all that matters.<br>  I had a nephew and niece who would never write thank you letters so I gave up on them.<br>  also, the economy is depressed now|`|LRJmHA7vaa	Could be that they can't afford it in these economic times. Or it could be that they think your all grown up now and don't need there money.|`|YrrtMS5Taa	Well aren't we spoiled. You should be thankful they thought of you at all, not whining about how they didn't give you cash.|`|yXUtl0aHaa	Maybe they didn't know what you wanted, but also, the world is going to hell in a hand basket.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	You're thinking to much into this. Just let it go and be grateful for what you have and for your health.
AA11108018	It is because girl are soft and smooth and smell good and the feeling is electrifying|`|P3OWfxi5aa	guys can be pervs lol|`|2WheJCmcaa	guys secretively want to be wanted. when you touch a guy they feel like your showing them attention and whatever attention they get they love.|`|9dcj2zFFaa	It turns them on.
anLDrJDOaa	i dont find that a stupid question ATALL. infact, it is scary. but that probably wasnt the best way to handle that situition. in your dream, ((say it were real)) you should have told her imedaitley, that you needed to talk to her, and if she's really your friend, she wont blow you off completly, if your opinion on this matter differ((they most likley WILL)) then just be persistant. you have to keep trying if she matters to you. the imedaite solution would 2 be 2  tell your counselor or mom, or even her mom, but that can be difficult to do, try to do what you can for your friend. facing the truth for you friend may be hard, but if she doesnt, it can hurt her all around inthe future. be safe.<br>  Blessings-S.M|`|BCjwhtqkaa	Haha not quite how you should deal it. I wouldnt even worry about it right now if shes not doing it.
lPR2NZSZaa	In many states, under age minors can not marry unless there is parental consent and/or court order allowing the county clerk to issue the couple a marriage license. If you are pregnant and wish to be married you must go to the talk to the people at the county office or court house and they will tell you the required procedure. It will probably be filling out a court petition for a hearing. You and the father show up with a doctors note explaining you are pregnant and how far along you are and how you both want to marry.  If you need help filling out your court papers it some times it pays to get your documents done by a Legal Document Preparer (LDP) go online to the National Association of Legal Document Preparers (NALDP) to find a LDP who may be able to help you.|`|GvamTVqAaa	yes, wait until you're 18.  Probably shouldn't get married before the baby is born anyway if the girl is still on her parent's insurance.|`|krQiDGCHaa	Nope.  Need parental consent unless you are over the age of 18.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  I must add too, don't get married just because you're pregnant.  My husband got married to his girlfriend of 3 months because she was pregnant when they were 18 and pressured by family.  Neither of them wanted to go through with it, but they did anyway.  They hated it.  They were divorced a year later.<br>  <br>  Not a good idea.  Unless, of course, you really just want to get married.  Then go for it, and good luck.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I think you can legally move out at 17, so you shouldn't need to get married. Just get a place together or whatever. Wait till 18+ for marriage.
tMXS76XWaa	dont worry about it! wear it on you other hand or maybe on a necklace. if your husband loves you (which he will if hes going to marry you) then he will understand...no biggie!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	on your right hand, or on a necklace.  Or choose another piece of jewelry.|`|lyWSufFBaa	You could wear it as a necklace or better yet, a lot of celebrities are starting to get tattoos in place of jewelry. It's just a suggestion.|`|B359bLqsaa	there is nothing that say you "absolutely must" wear a wedding band on a certain finger, or even that you "absolutely must" wear a wedding band at all.  Some people never wear wedding bands, but that does not mean they do not love their spouse just as much as the ones who do.  I dont personally go for symbolism, I go more for concrete emotions.  If I feel loved, and am treated as if I'm loved, I don't mind the absence of a ring.  I think its very possible for you to find a mate who loves you even if you are OCD and will not force you to do anything you are uncomfortable with.|`|UUrqECXIaa	A ring is just a symbol, its really not important, wear it on your right hand. The love and commitment that you have for your spouse is what counts.<br>  <br>  My son has OCD too. Your issue is not the same issues he has but I understand where you are coming from.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Your future husband will have to understand your condition and maybe try wearing your ring on your right hand or maybe even around your neck so that its close to your heart.|`|U2YK6lcJaa	you could get a ring tattoo?|`|hN090HL8aa	I would recommend some counseling to overcome your OCD. I used to have it too and talking to someone about and overcoming it makes your life much easier. :)|`|an7qtWORaa	I couldn't wear my ring.We just had an understanding. Maybe if you can compromise and wear it sometimes or attache it to your clothing.|`|OTgKodFqaa	you should make it into something like a necklac or wear it on yr right hand

I would tell the teacher to flunk you....no your dad  is not over reacting.....under reacting!|`|oKExTm8paa	You have to take the consequences for your actions. No, your Dad is not overreacting. You show no respect for teachers. That is not good.|`|R29QkoQDaa	i completely understand.my dad was just like that! i did that once and the teacher swore right back at me. he got fired. i have that effect on people i really don't like. don't let any one ever tell you what is right and what is wrong. you do what you do from Instinct and any one that takes that away from you is the one that should be in trouble.|`|yXUtl0aHaa	.... thats fu*ked up.

akvrwpywaa	Not really.  Children these days need more discipline.|`|lGSUToFQaa	i think kids need a chance to be themselves, yes they need discipline but they need freedom too my 8 yr old has no curfew, but i know where she is and she's never late, if she says "Mom i'll be home at 8" she walks in at 8. i don't have rules for her cause she's a good kid, my parents on the other hand were so rule happy it was crazy, i left home at 15 and that's when i grew up, cause i didn't have people telling me what to do and how to do it, but my hubby's mom still trys to control him and our life, it's freaking insane, she tries to tell him how to dress and what to do and all this stuff i just want to slap her and say he's 22 yrs old leave him alone, his brother is 38 and still lives at home cause she ran off his wife, she couldn't take it, my mil was always redoing what she did, of course i've told her my hubby might not have balls to stand up to you, but i have big dd's and it's my life i'm living it. she hates me, but yes controlling parents are insane. <br>  <br>  my mom made me be a cheerleader, blue bells, gymnastics, beauty pagents everything cause she wanted that life for me, i liked sports, my daughter picks her own stuff and if she doesn't like it i don't make her stay in it. she's a real person she knows what she does and doesn't want why should i try to make her someone she isn't. when i still worked i had so many clients that would come in why is my kid doing this etc, cause you are suffocating them with rules and structure and breaking their spirit by making them someone they aren't it's sad really.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	well i dunno wat to sat i am 19 so i do wat i i wanna but just talk to ur mom and see y she is so controlling|`|J6JFiNL8aa	only the first part...about the mom being an actress so the child is to become the same...thats disturbing.......everything else no...your mom knows whats best for you 90% of the time...espeially when your young...you'll miss them when there gone and when you get older you'll realize most of what they said was true|`|4rA9hhQ2aa	yer defonatley..so annoying|`|rjYYZnrgaa	yes i know how you fell my parents are the same way...|`|PUg4go20aa	My parents (well mostly my dad) was and still is controlling, even after being out of the house for over 2 years and me being almost 25.  When I was at home I thought that I should listen to what he said and do what he said.  Then I realized how messed up he made my life making me live it how he wanted me to and me not thinking for myself.  I will never be like that to my children after knowing how it has affected my life.  All you need to do is be supportive for what your child wants to be and just be there for them.  Even if they make a mistake they will learn from it.  <br>  So yes, I do HATE controlling parents!

But it did put a scar on me...Just that never knowing him sends questions through me. But with all the deaths that i have endured the last couple of yrs. one thing that always gets me is i do not cry at any of the funerals..I actually laugh. People stare at me for it but my emotions send it the wrong direction. even the people who were my family that i was close with...my grandpa..my uncle...my grandma...my uncle...I've lost so many family it sucks. i'm only 24. but experienced death for so long it just something that happens now. no emotion just a blank slate.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I don't think you are ever really prepared even when it is expected.  <br>  <br>  My mother battled breast cancer for 2 years before she finally died.  <br>  <br>  The last two weeks of her life just seemed to drag on and when she finally died it was just such a relief to know that she wasn't suffering any more.<br>  <br>  I did cry for a very short time on the way from the hospice to the funeral home but I was pretty much numb for 2 years after that and didn't really have a good cry until the 2nd anniversary of her death.|`|1EyRZm4Faa	Yes, My father died about 8 years ago, and I still can't help but tear up about it sometimes...He was just so awesome.|`|AA10415600	My father is 76 with a heart that gets weaker everyday because of two heart attacks and my mother is 70 who had colon cancer.

They are so important to me and losing them, I know, will put me in shock for a very long time.

I feel the loss has made me a mother who has enjoyed every day of life with my husband and daughters.. My dad passed when I was 21, at that age I just missed him and felt a lot of anger..

JNCq4EcBaa	WOW! You are going in with a lot of baggage.. please don't think that was criticism.<br>  <br>   I have been married to my second/last/and forever husband for 11 years. I had 3 children, he had 3 children and we had one more together. My children's father was in & out and back in the picture and was only a major pain when he remarried (which didn't last), BUT his children's mother...who has custody, was/is "crazy".<br>  <br>  The only reason we are still married is because we made a covenant promise to each other to never end up divorced again no matter what. We had to both be committed to the fact that it was simply NOT an option. We have struggled through blending families, crazy ex's, crazy ex's new wives and our own faults too. It has been hard and sometimes walking away seems easier and more sane. But here we are 11 years and counting, We are stronger partners, stronger parents and stronger people. I don't regret the bad times, and there were bad times, because they made us who we are.<br>  <br>  All the answers I have read so far are great answers too!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	How do you intend to work out the money, the bills?  How much will you save each month?  Who will be the one responsible for most of the caring for the children?  I can go on and on.|`|lyWSufFBaa	I would have thought you guys might have already discussed everything before becoming engaged.  What is it you don't already know? You need to ask yourself how well do you know this man before even considering him as your soon to be husband.  What do you love about him.  What can both of you contribute to the marriage, and I'm not just referring to money.<br>  <br>  Edit: Since his son will be living with the two of you as well as your kids you definitely want to discuss discipline.  Some people act funny when it comes to disciplining their children and you definitely don't want that to come between you and him.  Also make it clear that you know his son’s mother is involved in her child’s life but you will not tolerate her interfering with your marriage (if she truly is crazy).  Have you thought about reversing the tube procedure?  I would discuss having children together and exactly how many. As far as pets, you may have to compromise.  I love animals but I could live without them if I had to.  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: I apologize if I was coming off harsh but I honestly wasn't sure what kind of questions you were referring to.|`|YFuIOVq0aa	LOTS, everything, anything, <br>  <br>  some things that come to mnd immediately are:<br>  <br>  what are your individual roles regarding the children - yours, his, and 'ours' How will you encourage all children involved to become part of a larger family unit?  Will your roles change as the children age? <br>  <br>  how important is post-secondary education and how will you prepare for the children to go to college?<br>  <br>  Consider retirement (yep, we all get to eventally) is this the time that he expects to .........  what are your goals for this period of your life? what do the two of you look forward to together?<br>  what is your parenting style? his? what are the household rules and expectations of each member of the house? how will the two of you raise the children involved?<br>  <br>  what values are important to each adult? <br>  <br>  what traditions are important to each family and how will they be 'blended'  ie. easter egg hunts, christmas stockings on mantle or foot of bed or none at all.<br>  <br>  how important are the pets and why does he hate them and why do you love them: is compromise important <br>  <br>  what will be expected of each partner regarding the running of the household, finances, debts, purchases, life insurance, savings<br>  <br>  if one of the children  are too ill to ... who does what?<br>  <br>  if one parent is too ill to .... who does what?<br>  <br>  how will you deal with conflicting opinions? <br>  <br>  what will the two of you do to maintain your personal relationship? date nights? vacations? personal time? <br>  <br>  remember that after the wedding, comes the marriage and a good marriage takes effort  <br>  <br>  congrats and best wishes to you all.|`|Km2nzm3saa	If each child gets their own room/cell phone/computer etc.<br>  <br>  Does the child with the "crazy mom" in the picture, does he live full time with her?  If so, does that son also get a private room at your house?  <br>  <br>  What will the kids call your parents and his parents, aunts, uncles, etc.  <br>  <br>  I think a lot depends on the age of the kids.  If they are older and are used to different curfew times and stuff you are going to need to compromise so the rules are the same for all the kids.  If they are young then you don't have to worry.|`|uuMCGT9taa	How the bills will be payed and raising children are you up for travel or home bodies. hwo do you both want to retire . how are the bank accounts gonna be handled.

The more men grow to reflect God, then the hearts of women will calm down and you will be more at peace. What is the nature of the woman and what is the nature of the man?<br>  <br>   The Holy Qur’an and Bible says, “Men are the maintainers of women.” It is the natural role of a man to work hard and produce what is necessary to maintain a woman and the children that are produced from that woman.  <br>  <br>  As a maintainer, he is a protector, provider, and he is supposed to guide.  Men cannot guide a woman just with sex, and if a man is dumb enough to think that sex can guide a female and same with female , then the marriage falls apart and the relationship tumbles down. <br>  <br>  Guidance comes from the brain (Intelligence), not from any other part of the body. Guidance must manifest wisdom and since you are the second self of God, then the man must bring to you wisdom and truth that is from God, because the only thing that can maintain the woman of God is the word of God, rightly brought from a man who is in the image and the likeness of God<br>  <br>  In Holy quran and Bible woman is three-times the value of a man, because she brings forth life. Women teach and train the offspring. So, if you are an ignorant, unlettered and foolish woman, you will make a foolish people. So when somebody wants to take the world down, they destroy the value of knowledge in a woman.  But the sriptures say GOD raise a foolish people or people lost knowledge of GOD.<br>  <br>  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.”  is only through her that we live again, and again, and again.<br>  <br>   It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world buildingbrain cells are created to think rightly to think rightly means to perceive reality properly, and to think on the basis of truthLove is the most awesome creative force in the universe.<br>  <br>   Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and ForgivenessThe true life of marriage is based in the quality of love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.|`|8259f37f3bb63217d47d975af43b7855aa	Those are good points to bring up before marriage.  If he hates pets, and you love them, maybe you can compromise?  My husband hated cats, and I told him if he'd let me get a cat, and I promised to take care of them would he agree?  He said yes, and that was 4 years ago & now he loves my cats as much as I do.  As for your tubes being tied, it can be undone.  Does he know your tubes are tied?  If not, he should before you get married.  Make sure he wants to have another child too.<br>  <br>  Figuring out who pays what bills is also good.  Does all the money you both make go in a joint account, how much your keeping out for yourselves every check, etc.  It's good to find out who's doing what chores too.  If you're both working, it's not fair to just have all the chores on 1 person, it should be shared.  Generally the outdoors stuff is done by the man, but outdoors tends to be seasonal, so you're doing all the indoor stuff all the time.  I'm going through that now!  If you haven't done it already, figure out where you'll live together, what schools the kids will go to, etc.  Good Luck!|`|sPemuE91aa	Whatever things are important to you or affect your everyday life.

Usually your family especially your parents know you better than anybody else on this planet. Get their opinion of this person. <br>  <br>  I would weigh the opinion of others that you trust and that are close to you, into your deciding factor if you really should marry this person or not.<br>  <br>  Don't forget some pre-marital counseling.

You are right, it does suck sometimes, but those times are few and far between.

A marriage is one of the most difficult relationships someone can have.

I suggest you just make good connections with friends who will have that close bond with you...and when the day comes that you find someone that you truly want to spend the rest of your life with...you will know.  You can't rush these things....I've been with the same guy for 9 years....officially together for 5 yrs...and we're engaged and I still think we are not ready for marriage cause I want to make sure to smooth everything out BEFORE we get married...cause you only want to get married once...if you put a huge effort into it at the beginning you will have less of a chance getting divorced...so don't settle and dont rush|`|NuUdCz0Laa	It is a joy and someday you will find yourself in the same joy, but first, keep up the school work and have fun while your young.

If you and your partner take your vows seriously and they are meaningful to you both. Then things shall be fine.<br>  <br>  But people need to understand marriage is a life long term commitment and once you exchange your vows then it is you and your partner for life, sharing life events together. It is not a mere dating relationship whereas when things may be bumpy you jump in with your dumped and you swerve back in and out when it suits you. Through goods times and bad times, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, till death do us apart you both should be able to work at things even if it means going to the unimaginable counseling sessions.<br>  <br>  Marriage is hard but it is rewarding when both people want to make things work and are not lead a stray by the unworthy of matters that will cause more pain as an output.|`|ZEitfScGaa	Its great. You get to share everything with your best friend.

Marriages do not keep themselves alive and flourishing- the participants do. Just remember, open communication, compromise and hot sex.|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Marriage is ... complicated.<br>  <br>  It is really nice being married and having someone to share things with but it also takes a LOT of work.<br>  <br>  Do not marry just to get married. Do not settle. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  :)|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Yeah it's nice, but "nice" isn't a reason to get married, it won't be a fairytale all the time.|`|Sp5TjXqMaa	Getting married so you can sleep next to someone every night is a very stupid and superficial reason. <br>  <br>  I do understand how you feel, but that should not be your basis. <br>  Marriage is work. Sometimes it's easy, other times it's hard.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  To be more specific. <br>  I do enjoy being married, but it is definitely not something to be taken lightly. People who get married because they want to be married often end up miserable and/or divorced soon after. I've watched a few couples go through it, so you should be careful. I'd hate to have that happen to you. :) <br>  <br>  The reasons|`|OEXHkNLTaa	The pet idea is wonderful. Get a dog, not a cat, then see how you can live with someone who will need your constant attention and nurturing. Marraige is for 2, not just for you, in the sense that you will "live for two"..make decisions that your husb agrees with, go to places your husb agree with, have a lifestyle he agrees with, spend money on stuff he agrees with..etc. If not, you will have a bumpy road and there will be arguments.  Imagine an addition of a child!<br>  <br>  YES, you can be "independent" in a marriage but you will soon find that you don't want to stay married after all, but be independent instead, and make your own decisions. SO the question is, if the man you marry is worth all that, or is he only worth the companion. "Companion" is not enough to make a marriage last, it will be empty and unsatisfying. You have to really CARE for them, like it's your BABY.<br>  <br>  Just rememer, even the most wonderful guys will eventually snore and/or hog the bed/the sheets/the pillows. You have to love them so much that it won't matter. Sleeping contently in the same bed night after night is a biggie. This person has to be worth you putting up with the eventual snoring/bed hogging.  <br>  <br>  Getting married fo the sake of "coupledom" or wearing a ring, or having a wedding, is not a solid enough reason to keep your marriage lasting. It will shatter once it all wears off. Only marry once someone is worth your life like that. Do not marry because there's a ring in front of you and a guy is on his knee,you have to be ready to give your life for him for you to be happy with him in a marriage. If you are, that means you care about him deeply and he does about you too..only then will your marriage be great and satisfying!<br>  <br>   If you don't care, and are ready for a life of multiple mariages, go for the first guy who proposes.Who cares, you can always divorce, right? If that is your attitude, just get a boyfriend and have "commitment" rings. It's easier to get out of if it doesn't work out.|`|XGp3oF5baa	I just got married in September of 2008 and it is the best! I love it. But don't just marry anyone or it won't be. It is amazing to fall asleep in the arms of someone you love. And waking up to a kiss is even more amazing. When you put your him before yourself and he does the same is when it is great. You always have someone to do something with. We are going to get a john boat this summer and we do fun stuff together all the time. it is fun cause we like the same things. But it is going to be as good as you make it. So have fun but don't rush. "Don't find someone you can live with, Find someone you can't live without."|`|AA11208683	well everyone is different, but for me i really love being married. i wanted to get married right away too, and yes falling asleep with them every night knowing that in the morning you will see their face is wonderful.... but in a marriage you both have to work at it. that will make it even better. but i would suggest finishing college first or if you do get married in college make sure that you still stay with college, because its hard in this world and jobs out there sometimes arn't in big supply. but yes marriage is amazing! especially if you get a good guy! good luck!|`|Nb0SBUK6aa	Marriage is nice when BOTH want to make it work.  There should be:<br>  Love<br>  Respect<br>  Sincerity<br>  Empathy<br>  <br>  If a person likes to do whatever she/he wants without telling anybody or without thinking about other feelings, that person should be single.<br>  <br>  Marriage is not for everybody.  Don't yield to the family/friends pressure if they start asking about grandsons.|`|eeCoeMZsaa	being married is beautiful if it is with the right person<br>  problems come and problems go but true love is forever<br>  and yes it is nice having some one to wake up too everyday <br>  God has given my angel and i feel very blessed every day<br>  good luck on your search|`|bMbFw8dwaa	Sometimes.  And you're right the other times it sucks to all end.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i think you're better off getting a dog for now.
lIO4uiJmaa	Its not weird at all, whatever the age difference between you.. When I go out with my friends, none of our partners join us and neither would we want them to not would they wish to.  <br>  <br>  We chat about girlie things - soap operas, clothes, general gossip - not the sort of thing any man would wish to discuss.<br>  <br>  The fact that your husband wants to come alone suggests that he is insecure and is sort of checking up on you and what you do, Maybe as you are a lot younger than he is, he is worried that you will talk to other men.<br>  <br>  Just continue to to what you are doing and let him deal with it.  Whatever you do don't stop seeing your friends.  But why dont you have a night out where everyone brings their partners every so often|`|514fe92d3b5ee587bad2e6c4029a3b3baa	I truly understand. You married a Man not a puppy! He need to know his place.You should be allowed time to yourself sometimes. Do he have friends, and if so then why would he want to hang out with you and your friends. Try going out when he is out with the fellas and have a relative babysit.( that cancel all that nonsense he doing) <br>  <br>  <br>  Give him a taste of his own medicine tag-along with him and his friends and act like you have better things to do! He'll stop!|`|d02gJC1aaa	it appears you have discovered the major problem with age gap relationships.  dont keep him away from you or it will drive him further away.<br>  <br>  politics and work are the most important thing to someone of that age as you will find out in 20 years, dont hold that against him.|`|f6ZFjatlaa	If it's a night out with the girls, then no he shouldn't be invited. There's times when I need girl time to catch up with my girlfriends but then there's times when we all go out as couples. You just have to determine if you are having too much girl time.|`|RiQA4Epraa	thats fine<br>  theyre your friends,<br>  he should have his own to<br>  <br>  but, 20 years difference, wow|`|ZEitfScGaa	This is why you don't marry a guy for money, it never works out.<br>  pathetic|`|fJeMjK9gaa	No, it's not weird. But remember, you chose to marry someone much older than you. This is one of the drawbacks. My wife is 19 years older than I. I like hard driving rock music and she likes Frank Sinatra. Her idea of going out and my idea of going out is like night and day. <br>  <br>  When we first met, I was 32 and she was 51 but she was a very youthful 51 in looks and in spirit. We had fun together. Now, she is 65 and I am 46 and this is where it gets difficult. We are not on the same page on almost everything. I am still in this marriage because I don't want to hurt her but I am not happy. I am a freak in bed and she thinks I am nuts and she doesn't want it much anymore. The list goes on and on. <br>  <br>  I just wanted to share this with you so that you know how age gap marriages can end up and why.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	I can't believe that he married you. Your 23. And of course you friends have nothing in common with him, he's past middle age. He isn't into the bars or getting hammered all the time or talking about stupid immature bullsh*t. Your married, to a 43 year old. Your done with your single bar hopping days, and going out all the time. I hope you love this guy a lot more then you say. I still can't believe that he married you. <br>  You should of married someone closer to your age. 43, I'm 30 and thats pretty gross even at my age. Why do such young women marry far older men? Clue me in on whats the appeal really. I would honestly like to know, but in an in depth answer. Not something stupid like because I love him.<br>  You married a grown up. If you wanted to be stupid and immature and talk about rubbish then you should of never gotten married. Being married is about growing up.<br>  Personally I think at 23, you shouldn't be marrying a 43 year old.|`|eYiYCnb5aa	Talk to him about it, seriously.  Tell him, that even though you are married to him, doesn't mean that he has to go out when you go out.  Tell him you want to take some time for yourself, with no worries of kids, work, or him(but dont be mean about it)<br>  <br>  But you have to make sure you give him time for himself and his friends sometimes, and you have to make time with him outside of the house also.  I hoped this helped a bit.|`|TCpWVW4Raa	I can't say I've been in the poisiton your in as I'm 20, but if i was going out with a 40 year old woman, I think I would have to explain to her that it would be nice to have some time out to just be alone with friends. After all theres no harm in that.|`|NBTuFkCFaa	Quite frankly I don't blame you. If he's going to whine and complain what you like to do with your friends, then leave him at home. You need time alone with your friends. Maybe try and find something you all like to do so your hubby won't be the party pooper. Good luck!|`|UNbdXGHIaa	I think tanner is right ,think why you married him lol ,baby see the difference of age ,if you really love him come on try to understand him or make him to understand  you ,try to talk to him about it ,maybe he gets the idea|`|kgfIsAneaa	you need to talk to him and tell him that you need space and time to go out and have fun with your friends,thats just life really.everyone need time away from there partner every so often. :D|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	would upset me if my hubby came out with me and the girls.<br>  <br>    try to make time for him by going out with friends you both have. <br>  <br>   hes just feeling left out.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	why bring sand to the beach. Let your Dad  hang with ur man.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Tell him that if he moans so much when he comes out, he shouldn't ask to come out with you or moan at you about it.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't like the immaturity then he should organise his own meals with his friends or with you alone to talk about these grown-up things. You want an escape and you want to be able to have immature friends to have a laugh with. <br>  <br>  If he can't understand this, then maybe he's not worth allowing him to come out with you. Let him live his own little boring grown-up life.|`|vzVVDuDIaa	Have you explained it to him? If no, then you need to(The whole truth not part, do not spare feelings, guys can tell if the part of the truth is left out and when we feel it is, we make up the rest in our head which leads to trust issues.) If yes then dont worry about it. If you are not fooling around on him then it shouldnt matter. It sounds like he is dependent on you for his happiness or enjoyment out of life which you need to address because if you dont it will be a problem later on. <br>  <br>  I know when my girl goes out it is like Christmas to me because its a free day for me to do the things I like to do by myself.<br>  <br>  I know he is your husband but I also know women a great deal and its already getting on your nerves so its not a stretch to say it will turn into a lack of respect for him because of his inability to be his own person, which then will turn into a resentment, and once resentment enters a relationship it is ALL down hill.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	If I were your husband, I would send you on your way! Being married is about being a team, a partnership. And YOU are not acting as if you are married. I think you are using him for money or something.<br>  <br>  He can do so much better, than being with some bar fly like you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	He should have married someone his own age if he wanted to be entertained by her friends.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I think you both need your own space, but occasionally he needs to go out with you. Maybe all go out for dinner instead of a club?<br>  Its nice to go out with the girls, but if you keep going out without him he might think something is up.|`|oXff24y0aa	holy **** who would marry a freakin old grandpa when they're young :|<br>  thats just disgusting<br>  <br>  but tell him you need your space. hang out with your friends. not have somebody you live with follow you around 24/7 and than moan about it.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	grow up and start being a team compromise|`|IvMPh09baa	tell him to go play with his own friends! nanny nanny-neener neener!!!

EFjrJmdXaa	I can't believe the second answer. I would love to be alone and raise a kid and I am a guy. Why do people make it seem like raising a kid is a job? To me it is an honor. I decided to have kids because I love the idea of giving life and being there to support that life. I raise my son 60% of the time if not a little more. It makes me sad to hear mothers who make it sound like their kids are ruining their life. That is horrible and heartless. Children are miracles. It is sad that people can't enjoy the life they have created and instead look at them as crutches. There is more important things in life than money and success. Having a kid and raising them right is success in life as far as I am concerned. Honestly girls that age can be very immature and resentful. Maybe she is doing it because he is being mean to her? There could be many reasons. If he isn't being mean to her and she is just doing it because she can then chances are she is just vindictive. It's really sad that a kid has to grow up experiencing that. Kids should have good strong role models not parents who act like children. A person should never try to use their kid against the other parent. I don't care how much you hate the other person it isn't right. If the other parent has a psychological issue and the main parent is trying to be cautious I can understand that, but if the girl is doing it just because she wants to hurt the other parent then she needs to grow up.|`|VMUwtGCuaa	guys get it easy when they have kids and don;t live with the mom and don't help  raise the child. would u like to raise a kid on your own.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Loads of girls do just this unfortunately. If a bloke does something like get another girlfriend, they tend to use the baby/children as pawns in their silly selfish games. Bad all round especially the little ones who miss out on their dad. The children are the innocent ones in these situations and off course their dads. It is manipulation, pure and simply and the general cause is usually jealousy on the mother's part because the fella has moved on and she ain't getting no attention. Of course there may be a more valid reason does he help with maintenance, does he genuinly want to love and care for the child? They both need to get some kind of mediation with this situation.|`|dtGy6YPYaa	I think she wants to keep him, guys just don't understand that teenage pregnancy is a lot to a girl. During her time of being pregnant she was looked down at, laughed at. etc. she probably has her future ruined because of this baby. and she probably thinks that the relationship with your brother is just not stable but she wants it to be she wants the best for her and the baby,|`|T7gf3v5kaa	She wasn't ready to have a child but she kept it and she blames him. Now she will use it against him since her life can't turn out the way "she wanted it to." It's her punishment for him. He can't be happy because she isn't happy.|`|na8ObA5Haa	simple she is a heartless B****. he should fight for his right to have full custody and get her out of his life as soon as possible!|`|Hb81eIs1aa	HOW is she using the girl against him?  You DO have babies to love and care for, but not when you're 17 or 18.  Then, you have them because you're stuck with them. ...not that you don't love them.   You're kinda vague.  She could just want him to pay for some baby food instead of taking his new girl out.  Be more specific.<br>  <br>  And really, this is exactly why I don't have sex.  I will NOT get pregnant and be left alone to care for a baby.  Meanwhile, the father is out enjoying himself.  Instead of spending time with his kid, he's out at the bars or banging other chicks and getting them pregnant too.  Unfortunately, the only way a woman can be sure a man is worth it is if he's willing to wait.  Because if they won't wait, then what is going to keep them around when you get older and you're not the body you once were?  NOTHING.  That's why 20 somethings everyday are getting husbands to leave their wives because these are the men that do it all for the nookie and don't really love a woman.  If your brother loved her enough to have a child for the right reason, then you wouldn't be referring it to "this girl".  She would still be with him.  Bottom line is the two of them made a mistake and she's stuck with it.  And what's this "choose to have a child" crap?  If you're pregnant, it's a little late to choose anything.  Okay, you COULD MURDER the baby or give away your flesh and blood to a total stranger that could molest or beat it.  But, is THAT a choice?  Yeah, children ARE great.  They're everything.  But they ARE a huge responsibility and it takes a family.  She might resent him if he left while she was pregnant or right after she had the baby.

For example, the next time he parks in your driveway, and you don't actually want to talk to him, get his license plate number and maybe snap a photo of him.  <br>  <br>  Contact the police.

I'm sure she can take care of herself without you reading her messages.|`|oFptKbCJaa	I would say this is pretty much ur faught, u shouldnt been looking at her stuff!|`|AA11103763	Don't do anything, you were snooping, and it's none of your business.|`|u6O2EF0taa	i don't think that u should mention anything cause i think she will think its kinda weird that u looked at the picture. and since its to her boyfriend its not really all that weird i mean its still weird but u know it makes more sense. now if it were sent to so sort of unknown stranger or something then that would be weird. anyways i guess how weird it is would depend on her age like if shes doing this and shes only a teenager then u know its kinda u know not rite. anyways try not to .think of it anymore i mean its all in the past. i mean shes still your friend nothings changed except u have now learned a little more about their relationship then u would have liked but still. its not that bad. just try not to think about it. dont let it run your life. dont think to much of something that they do.|`|9OHeder5aa	I'm afraid we don't have enough information to answer this question... a post of the picture might give us enough to answer though.|`|gRXy66dOaa	i know what u mean<br>  <br>  she fingure herself<br>  <br>  well just let this go, dnt make this a big thing
BLsdUBfIaa	OK, well it either means that you guys like each other. If he's responding and staring back and laughing with you then that most likely means that he likes you. <br>  <br>  Go up to him and talk to him. If you kinda think about it, it won't really be your first time talking to him, since you already kinda know him. All your doing is taking it a step further. <br>  <br>  GO UP AND TALK TO HIM. People here can't tell you what is going on between you two, except you and him. Even I can't tell you, I just told you MOST LIKELY, not SURELY. <br>  <br>  SO GO UP and TALK TO HIM!! This is the only way to know for sure whether or not he likes you back. <br>  <br>  IF you want to avoid my advice and try to find another way out and find out what it means, GOOD LUCK!!<br>  Your going to need it, because like I said, the only way to know for sure what's going on is to TALK TO HIM!!<br>  <br>  I know it may sound scary, but just take a deep breath and relax. Imagine in your head how your going to go up to him. What your going to talk about. Don't just do this kind of thing on the last minute, or else you'll freeze up and won't know what to do. <br>  <br>  Email me if you want to talk this more, or you want more advice!! I'll be happy to answer them!! <br>  <br>  And don't worry I'm not a guy, and I answer plenty of these kinds of questions. I give my email to everyone I answer so that I can help them with their problems, like you! LoL, so email me if you want!!<br>  <br>  babikrystalrose@yahoo.com|`|z3QsWmzpaa	i think he might like you or he sees you as a good mate  =]|`|Km2nzm3saa	He prolly likes you.

Just keep doing what your doing. If you try to talk to him or flirt he may become offended. Like, I mean, like if he's crushing you, he'll take his time to let you know. If you do anything to disrupt that or make him think you like him he may think your coming on to him or being too pushy...hope I helped(:|`|9XlQdh2Aaa	I think that's cute. I think you should talk to him... maybe he likes you but is just too shy. Sometimes guys like when a girl will come up to them first.. bc it takes the pressure off of them. So next time you see him, ask how his day as been or what his plans for the weekend are. Good luck!|`|x5o5ip44aa	Well there's definitely a connection going on there but wether u want to start a relation ship or not is up to u.

If shes hurting your feelings then tell her, tell her you don't like the way she's treating you.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	shes not a true friend if she does that lose that friend cos shes your friend shes just not a a real friend|`|y5DAfNtHaa	Just call her friend, not a best friend if you are confused..|`|RIDwzLfaaa	Maybe u should try talking to her seriously. Tell her how you feel. Tell her that you value her friendship but that you dont appreciate the way she's been acting. She might have problems of her own. You never know. First find out and if she's just a punk well you dont need negative people around you.|`|9cqKiu2Taa	Well she is not a friend if she douse those things. A real friend would sit down and listen to you and always make you feel better. And at the worst of times stick with you.

3MmVWDT3aa	I think it is really good! It is a bit short-but hey, it came from the heart. All I would change is the last line, it doesn't seem to fit. Why don't you say something like, "And I want to be with you all over again." But raise your tone of voice to a faster pitch when you say again, so it will make a distinction when you say 'again' (lol) again.

1rXRSoKgaa	Your boyfriend|`|CM1dfztQaa	I would send a nice gift to the friend with a card conveying my regrets, and go to the family wedding. You and your man have been together long enough that his family will expect you there. It may really hurt their feelings if you don't go, especially if they consider you family.<br>  <br>  Your friends should understand that family comes first. If they do not, they aren't good friends.|`|cqgWkdPtaa	you're bfs brothers wedding <br>  <br>  and for a few reasons<br>  1. First in<br>  2. he's a long term bf and you really should be there for such a big occasion<br>  3. you were originally not invited to the other wedding<br>  4. your friends will be there to support suzanne, your bf would feel lost without you at such a romantic and joyous occasion.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I would go to the boyfriend's brother's wedding. After two years you are part of the family, and it would be best if you attended that wedding and not one of just a friend.|`|AA11380378	Boyfriend' sbrother. Meet the family and graciously accept the invitation. This is a big step./<br>  <br>  As far as Suzzanne, let her have her small wedding. Send a gift and a card.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	the wedding in my boyfriend's family would take priority for me.  He invited you first.  he should come before the girlfriend group if you are serious about him.|`|w1necKzYaa	easy one she said you were not invited! you were invited to the brothers! but would go to the brothers wither way!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Your boyfriends brothers'. He's family and if you've never been to a family wedding its a great time to get to know all the relatives you haven't met. I'm sure Suz will understand, otherwise tell her you had prior engagments which is not even a stretch of the truth.|`|daad5816a1ed7c1ff45110fb2bfa9d4daa	Your boyfriend's brother's wedding hands down. The date was set before the friend and this is his family member. It must mean a lot to have you there.|`|29I8PWrxaa	Let your friends go to Suzanne's wedding and be there to support her.  You should go to your boyfriend's brother's wedding with him.|`|4G6FFKrxaa	Definitely go to your boyfriends brothers wedding, no question.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I would go to the boyfriends brothers. He is basically family, is the way i would look at it.|`|IbhX8kHxaa	Go with your boyfriend!!|`|RuKK1LYiaa	hate to say but i'd go to my boyfriends cause theres always the chance he might propose to you eventually and you wouldnt want to miss out on this sort of occasion, and you dont want to hurt him by going to someone elses wedding.<br>  <br>  Edit: No way are you being a bad friend and if you friend is truly your friend she wont be upset with you she will be more than understanding.|`|wRHhpanmaa	I would definitely go to my boyfriend's brother's wedding. for quite a few reasons...<br>  1) His family may take it the wrong way, and feel that perhaps you didnt want to go to his brother's wedding<br>  2) It may be a special day for the two of you. Romantic dancing etc. and maybe you may even get a ring too.<br>  3) If you went to your friend's wedding then your boyfriend wouldn't be going with you, you would be going with your friends.<br>  <br>  I agree hands down that it is important to keep friends. however, she was not even going to invite you to begin with. So honestly, how welcome would you feel at her wedding anyways. Perhaps she only invited you because she knew she had hurt your feelings. Plus, if you intend to stay with your boyfriend a long time, this is your family too. Think of what you would be losing on both ends. Your friend would understand if you couldnt make it. Just tell her you were invited to your boyfriend's brother's wedding first. Or perhaps you don't have to choose. You could go to her house, (or the church, wherever the wedding is being held) tell her how beautiful she looks, and how much you are sorry you can't make it, and tell her you are happy for her. drop off a gift, and then go to your boyfriend's brother's wedding. That way you are not really letting anyone down.|`|p27jMTFuaa	I would go to your bf's brother's wedding.  If you are planning on any future with your bf then he will be family someday.  Family always comes first.  Let Suzanne know that you are disappointed and that you love her and are excited for her.  She will understand that family takes precedent.  I would also get a nice gift and have it sent to them.

AA10529674	It's ridiculous to think that just because a guy is a Libra that he's a womanizer. I know someone who used to be a womanizer and he isn't a Libra. It has more to do with what the guy thinks of himself. If he's the pompous arrogant type who thinks too much of himself then you can call him whatever you like. But if he's sweet, well mannered and treats women with respect then you can bet that he has good parents who taught him how to respect woman.<br>  The guy I was talking about who used to be a womanizer changed his ways. He's not like that anymore so even if a man is a womanizer, he can change if he really wants to.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	no, that's silly.

You do not need an apt.  Tell them all you've been going thru.  Tell them you actually fear for you life as you have NO control over him.  Ask for a restraining order to be served to him.  This w/keep him away from you, AND there w/be absolutely NO correspondence between you whatsoever.  IF he breaks the restraining order, he WILL go to jail.  You from that day on w/have NOTHING to do or say to him.  He w/be completely out of your life.  IF he has his belongings in your home, he w/have 30 days to get them out, & a cop w/come w/him to remove them.  You'll be totally  protected by law from him.  Please please do get him out of your life tho, & this would be the way to do it.  I've been there & have done it, so KNOW it w/work for you too.  Judges look very unfavorably at domestic violence.

I know that's hard to just do, but just know that it's her problem, not yours.  People are going to be annoying and in your business all the time if you're popular.  You could stop being appealing, but that would have a lot of bad effects too.  My advice is just to keep ignoring it.  It'll stop eventually.  And stop yelling at people:  it's not nice.
WENGBNXhaa	that honestly isn't wierd anymore, to me. many women are starting to chose that option either because they can't get pregnant or they wish to stay a virgin (which seems highly unlikey to me)<br>  <br>  not all people will think the same way about it as you do. it's ok that your friend thinks that way. as long as you are ok with it, it doesn't really matter<br>  <br>  i've honestly have not experienced that. my mother was able to have me and my sister with my father (but they are divorced now)|`|oKExTm8paa	Your friend needs to keep up with the times. I think the first tube baby was born in the 1980s in England. That's a long time ago. There are lots of kids in your situation. It definitely is not weird. I always thought of it as a miracle. Remember, you wouldn't be here without that procedure. :)<br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask for your parents' advice on whether or not to tell people you are a tube baby. Some kids (like your friend) just don't understand and might be embarrassed. When you get to know somebody well, that might be the time to mention it. <br>  <br>  Always remember that anything out of the ordinary will be viewed by certain people as "weird." That's because they are not open-minded or curious about life.<br>  <br>  Maybe somebody else in your situation will answer your question. I hope so.

Just play it cool and see where he takes it.  Also, us men love to chase...if he's after you then gently push him back and see what he does.  You should do that anyway so his girlfriend won't think your trying to get him and you can see what his intentions are.  If he wants you, he is going to stay close.

W0XoDxJraa	Don;t feel guilty. It is natural and normal. Cheating on your husband involves another person. Masturbating is just you alone giving yourself pleasure, and yuor imagination. It doesn't detract from a relationship, but enhances it. Heck, your husband can't be around for yuo every single time you're in the mood! Sometimes it's good to relieve the tension...and nothing at all to feel bad about. I don't see why it would hurt him, but if you think this perhaps it's best to do it discreetly. But understand that you are doing this discreetly because you are sensitive to how your husband may react, not because you are doing something unfaithful.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Everybody does it.|`|514fe92d3b5ee587bad2e6c4029a3b3baa	It not cheating. Is normal and I bet it will turn him on to see u do  it that way you won't fell guilty.|`|AA11899639	no, perfectly healthy|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	no it's normal.  Maybe he would love to watch you while you're masturbates too.  would be + sign for men.|`|Afb76ncraa	I hope not mine likes to watch me and I love to perform for him.|`|AA11758925	Wanna know the absolute truth, Your husband is doing the exact same thing :)<br>  he would rather you masterbate than be hooking up with someone else. Tell him you want a vibrator for when he is gone and you need some loving. Bet he will have you one with batteries included the next day|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	it is FAR from cheating!  i bet that if you masturbated in front of your husband he would get REALLY turned on!  good luck!|`|0c0ywvuRaa	no i dont think so. but you should talk to him about it. i keep my gf very satisfied, she loves sex with me, we do it alot. but yet we both do masturbate when we are alone once in a while. you should try talking to him about it, tell him that its not cause you arent satisfied. just explain why you do it. he should understand.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	God, I hope not!!!  <br>  <br>  PS I bet he does it too!|`|0PdYYeBFaa	No that is not cheating. It just makes you aware of your sexual likes..and you can use that to help tell your husband if your open as to how you would like him to turn you on.<br>  <br>  If you feel guilty why don't you ask your husband to join in with the foreplay.|`|AA11678629	theres nothing wrong with this at all|`|gys7lVFOaa	Of Course its not wrong!  Get yourself off girl!  If it bothers you, next time do it in front of him!  He'll get turned on and want to help--that can't be bad can it?  When you're finished, tell him you want to watch him.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	And you don't think he is choking the chicken every chance he has?<br>  <br>  Ha ha silly girl.  You ARE fooling yourself.<br>  <br>  I masturbate IN FRONT of my men, so I really don't understand the ignorance in your guilt.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	Ask him. Be honest.<br>  If you would be bad if he did then you should probably stop. Everyone does it though and I don't think its cheating.|`|AA10230888	No, most married women masturbate, its perfectly normal and okay to do <br>  i doubt he would be mad if he found out|`|USooqQlWaa	Good god I hope not.  Most men love it.  Sometimes I do it so he can watch.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	He does it, no it does not mean you cheated. Have at it, ask him to join you sometime.|`|eYiYCnb5aa	No, it does not count as cheating.  Cheating is when you actually have another man, (or woman) touch you and pleasure you.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is proven that it relieves stress and it gives you the feeling that your in control.<br>  <br>  Everyone does it, married or not, and I can guarentee he does it too.<br>  <br>  So dont worry about.  Have at it :)|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	masturbating is not cheating, unless its hampering your sex life.  Women do it, men do it, etc.  Try including your husband in it, bring up the suggestion, might spark some more sexual exploration for both.  Always share these things that you enjoy with your spouse, its only weird when you feel it necessary to sneak around.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Not wrong at all in my eyes as long as it's not replacing him.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	No your not cheating. Its a natural thing.  What you do need to do is have a "sex" talk with your husband and let him know how you like doing that and if you can involve that into your sex life. Maybe doing it as foreplay for your husband will kill the "wanting" to do it alone.|`|AA10353286	I'm married. I masturbate. Sometimes alone. Sometimes with my husband. Masturbating is great. You know yourself better than your husband, and always will. Get him to join you.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Masturbation is simply an escape for a sudden arousal or anything else that brings up sexual tension. You have to explain to your husband that you are extremely happy with your sexual relationships and that you are very much happy with him also, but you have been masturbating recently.<br>  <br>  Then ask him whether he minds very much and if he would like you to stop, or if you can continue. If he wishes for you to stop, tell him that you will and make sure you stop.<br>  <br>  It would not be classed as cheating it is merely a sexual act that is done when he is not around, it should not affect your relationship.|`|LeskhqT9aa	it would be a 'BIG  TURNON 'for your husband to watch you masturbate, he would really like it, i know i enjoy it when my wife masturbates , IT'S HO tHOT,HOT.|`|CnSaGHqWaa	In my mind masturbating is like taking a chill pill with benefits. I also think there is a time and place to share and a time and place to be private, even in a marriage. Most married people and those that live together that I know do not share all their personal bathroom habits with their spouse. So, the not sharing argument doesn't hold water. Masturbating is one of those little life pleasures that can be done quickly, effortlessly, quietly (usually), can take the place of drugs, can change an attitude and simply feels wonderful. Even the best sex you've ever had cannot match a good hand job, as long as you are satisfied with being alone for that moment. To those that say different, they're either lying or simply too ignorant to enjoy this one little sliver of life's wonders that doesn't hurt anyone, feels great, relieves tension and has saved countless relationships. I say spank that monkey and smile.|`|veufnjsNaa	SERIOUSLY!<br>  ask yourself this...is it bad for a married man to masturbate? you know its not so do not push double standards on yourself.<br>  you have as much right as anybody else to do it IT IS YOUR BODY!|`|atV28deKaa	Well it's best that you masterbate than going out in cheating.  There's nothing wrong wit what you doing.  Ur husband shouldn't trip about it and might wanna sit n watch you do it.|`|1fa1d82a6a831651d482ff85ed3b01dfaa	Ummm, you own your own body and you can do as you please with it. Your husband masturbates as well so nothing to be embarrassed about.|`|zhmpxdOnaa	Nope.  I think I remember reading someplace that technically female masturbation was never condemned in the bible.. just for guys. ;)|`|e3b8b825895e40fb941cd8e7d2ea18a0aa	I don't think it is wrong or cheating.  But consider sharing it with him.  It might be a whole new opening into your sex life.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Nope I do it all the time... I'm not married though. I've ben living with my bf for 3 years. Don't worrie its no big deal what he don't know won't hurt him|`|kbz5S3waaa	wow, only a few times a month? you're fine, and even if you don't know about it, he does it too.|`|u1uECuFNaa	My husband knows I do. <br>  I told him. He is not here though, so it is fine.<br>  He uses my toys on me during...<br>  Well, he has no problem with it so far....<br>  :)<br>  It is not cheating. <br>  Toys are not real. <br>  Maybe you should ask him...|`|bO2rzfISaa	For god's sake, who are you cheating with, your own hand?  Of course it's not cheating. <br>  <br>  Did he ask you not to masturbate? I'll bet he didn't, and I'll bet he does it. It's natural. When I do it, it's because my husband isn't filling all my needs. You sound really repressed.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	no it is safe and natural and you should ask your husband if he would like to watch|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Nothing wrong with it. And I promise you he does it too!|`|oWthd5Gqaa	it is NOT wrong at all!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is a normal healthy thing!!!! and i bet u a million bucks he does it too!!  i know me n my hubby do and it doesnt matter to either of us, watch or listen to dr, dru, he is an awesome sex therapist with ALL the answers!!  =)|`|FXCoGD44aa	No! Oh my gosh, whoever taught you that masturbating was ever wrong - married or not?! <br>  <br>  It's completely acceptable and it is NOT cheating. I bet if you told your husband, he would be turned on by it - most men are - and he might even want to watch you! Masturbation is healthy and nothing to ever be ashamed of.<br>  <br>  Cheating is when you are doing something with someone ELSE romantic in nature [[sexual or not]] that you wouldn't otherwise do if your spouse was there. For example, you wouldn't flirt with another man or make out or have sex with someone ELSE outside of your marriage. But enjoying yourself BY yourself - not even close.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	It is absolutely OK to masturbate even if you are married. I am sure your husband does. There is no need to feel guilty about it. You can take it a little further by making it a sex act if you want. You can masturbate each other or masturbate in the Presence of each other. Trust me, your relationship will reach a different level by doing this.|`|svzGz9STaa	Some religious people feel that masturbation is a sin. A male friend of mine struggles with it. <br>  <br>  I do not feel that it is wrong, depending on what you're thinking of while you're doing it. If you're thinking about an old BF or that cute guy at work, then I think it's wrong. If you're thinking of things you and your husband have done, no problemo.<br>  <br>  All that being said, if you tell your husband about it, he might think it's sexy and want to watch. Nothing wrong with that either.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	Well i see masturbating as apart of human nature. guys do it all the time whether they are married or not so why can women do it. I don't think it's wrong in any way shape or form and certainly not a form of cheating. your only human honey just like the rest of us and that only proves you to be a human being. :o)|`|uO0NW2nZaa	masturbate away all married men do it so why no women it beats cheating|`|AA11596133	NO IT IS NOT WRONG, immoral, or in any way considered cheating - that is unless you have a personal deep caring relationship with your choice of masturbating "tools".<br>  <br>  Stop stressing - I do it too, and sometimes it just makes me go grab him and make that feeling last even longer - no need for foreplay because I am already all warmed up!|`|YIlP4yNaaa	It is actually very good for a married woman to masturbate. It kind of stimulates your body and keeps it ready for sex. It also lets you give your body that pleasure when your sex life slows down due to work, stress or other reasons. Don't ever stop masturbating.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	It's not cheating.<br>  <br>  And just think of it this way: would you be upset if HE were masturbating? <br>  <br>  If you would be, then stop. If you wouldn't be, then continue. <br>  <br>  My guess is that he masturbates as it is.<br>  <br>  However, I really see nothing wrong with what you're doing.
6Vaaqle0aa	It depends what kind of person you are ...<br>  <br>  If you are a person who can forgive and forget and gives everyone a second chance with full trust, you should resurrect this friendship and allow her back into your life. You will give her this one last chance and you will do it for the sake of your friendship. But make it very clear that if she ever does anything to hurt you again, that will be the Absolute end.<br>  <br>  If you are a person who is unforgiving and lives in the past too much, you may begin to see problems that aren't there when your best friend comes out with your husband and may begin making mountains out of molehills. Therefore you need to be aware that you may not be able to live under the situations or conditions and actually you need to be distancing and building your relationship with your husband, rather than her as it brings back bad memories.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|uBssj3Znaa	My best friend slept with my boyfriend when we were younger. We stopped talking as well, but like you, I missed her and her friendship. We two reconnected and are just as close as ever if not even closer. <br>  <br>  People do things when they are young without fully thinking about consequences. If both of you are prepared to completely move on with your friendship regardless of what has happened in the past, then you can easily rebuild your friendship.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	yes just let it go and start where you left off before the fling|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Me personally...I am too close with my best girlfriends to ever allow such a betrayal and then forgive it.  I wouldn't do that to them and they wouldn't do that to me.  My circle of close girlfriends has been reduced over the years.  Personally, for my own healthy mindset, I would forgive her in my prayers but I would not resurrect the friendship.  When trust is totally and completely blown in a relationship, what else is there?  Nothing is left.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If you kept him, keep her.  But um keep them separately.|`|vFCva8R5aa	Are you still with the guy? <br>  <br>  Lets hope she does not want to go for round 2 huh?|`|G6Uy43coaa	Staying with him was you choice and you probably did so because you love him.  If you choose to remain friends with her that too will be your choice.  Just because you forgave him doesn't mean you have to forgive her.  It's not a "package deal" on forgiveness and your reasoning for choosing to forgive one and not the other is your business...no one else's.<br>  <br>  You don't have to remain friends with her unless you want to.  It would depend on how good a friend she REALLY was before, during and after the affair.  Some people will smile in your face as they are turning the knife they put in your back....I know.  No one needs "friends" like that.|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	wow thats a tough one, remember it took 2 to do the duty.  If you forgave your husband, and that worked, then forgiving her is the right thing to do.  I gotta hand it to you, that is something I'd never forgive either for, and if something happens, like they are alone together in the near future, can they stop it from happening again? Will you trust either to be in the same room alone together?  Big questions, tests of your trust and love for your husband.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Having a fling with my husband would be a total deal breaker for me.  I can be very forgiving, but forgetting is another story.  I would not allow someone like that back in my life especially if you are still married to this man.  Don't get me wrong, you can be cordial with her just not best friends.|`|pORmp0tfaa	Why would you trust someone who betrayed you in basically the worst way possible? Yeah you miss her but is she really the kind of friend you want to have or are you just being nostalgic? Grown women or not I can't imagine you wanting her anywhere near you or your husband. Selfish people will always be selfish people.|`|514fe92d3b5ee587bad2e6c4029a3b3baa	if you chose to than yes, but personal I would have beaten her tail each and every time I seen her.

pORmp0tfaa	You're going to have to tell your parents, because it's going to get pretty hard to hide that you're pregnant. And I think you should tell the guy, he has a right to know since it's his kid too. As for whether you want to give it up for adoption or keep it... only you can decide but at your age I don't think you can give the child the life it deserves so my personal opinion is you should give it up for adoption.|`|2tn8EALqaa	wtf?? OF COURSE YOU SHOULD TELL HIM|`|a8xY9rRgaa	you need to tell the father and your parents and try to raise the baby on your own|`|ZxCK2vi9aa	Wow sounds like Secret Life. Well, my TV Series obsession aside... You should definately tell your parents... you can't hide it forever. They can also help you more than anyone else. You should let the father know, but tell I'd say tell your parents first. Depending on how your parents are with the baby, the decision between keeping the baby and giving it up for adoption should be taken very seriously. Caring for a child is extremely difficult, and especially at only 15. Just remember to do what you think is best for the BABY, not JUST yourself... but that doesn't mean putting yourself through extreme emotional pain. Still keep yourself in mind, too, but don't give up the baby simply because you don't want to miss out on time hanging out with friends. Or vice versa... don't keep the baby if you aren't in a good position to, simply because you want to. Best of luck to you. God Bless.|`|nSdYPN8Raa	lol this sounds just like the secret life of the american teenager!!<br>  ok sorry bout that... to be honest you have tell your parents about this now so they can help you to either get an abortion (only if you want too) or so they can help make sure the pregnancy goes well. even though it may be awkward its the right thing to do<br>  as for the guy who got you pregnant in the first place you could tell him or you could not. it is partly his fault and if you want him to be apart of the babies life then tell him... if the girlfriend finds out the blame is on him there, so dont worry about that part.<br>  good luck... and i hope my advice helps =)<br>  p.s. the adoption and raising the baby yourself is completely up to you but adoption my be better because your only 15 with your whole life still ahead of you|`|QXObA6THaa	i say yes you should tell him he has a right to know that he has a baby on the way you should tell your parents there gonna be mad at first yes but they love you and will help you get threw this on what ever you decide what to do as far as adoption i think that would be hard carrying the baby for 9months and then giving it up you wont be able to see his/hers first steps the first time they sit up on there own there first smile but at the end of they day its all up to you i hope everything works out for you and good luck!!!!!|`|np2kU9ixaa	well your GONNA have to tell your parents eventually! Talk to them about it. and yes, you should tell him. its only fair,|`|Oi9IG07Waa	Tell him. and i unno it depends which kind of situation you are in you should talk to your parents and see how much they would support you. At 15 your parents do need to know for sure and if you do not tell them they will eventually find out anyways and just be mad at you for not telling them. once the baby is born you will become attached to him/her but give the baby the best life possible. Dont punish him/her for your wreckless mistake. If you are having sex you should be more responsible and so should the guy you are hooking up with. He def needs to know so that he sees the error of his ways. He should be more careful. Dont consider his feelings he is the one who impregnated you he knew the risk when you guys did it and it is time for him to face the consequences of his actions.|`|H0uovbcaaa	Take a few days to figure out for yourself what you would like to do before you tell anyone because no matter what happens it will be something that you have to live with for the rest of your life.

I feel so bad for you because i know this will haunt you forever. thats why abstinence is d** sure the best thing rockin im 18 in college and live a crazy life but i'll be d*** if i have a baby. i cant give any advice but you should of said "no" no when it comes down to sex is the best way to go>!<br>  <br>  =[<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck**|`|9b2LjDRJaa	WOW.

xA1fdVimaa	oh sweetie, when you get to the point where you're having to check behind the one you're with (just to see if they're telling you the truth), then the trust in the relationship is in serious question ... which will eventually lead to the end of the relationship.<br>  <br>  checking phone records, following them, or doing anything along those lines does you no good in the long wrong.  starting down that path will affect that relationship (or any future relationship) in a negative way.  additionally, how trustworthy is his sister.  if you've already talked to him about this, and you feel this is still going on ... just walk away from him.<br>  <br>  "When in Doubt, Leave it Out"|`|ejrxNVD1aa	are you dating? if you are he probably could cheat on you if he has not already|`|XvBlEUJraa	If you have to go through this much trouble for him, don't bother.

oKExTm8paa	Do you mean it will be awkward talking to your Dad's girlfriend? (You don't have to worry about talking to the new baby for awhile.)<br>  <br>  You are probably feeling strange about your Dad's new relationship and him having sex with somebody besides your Mom. <br>  <br>  Just be friendly to the girlfriend and maybe help her with the baby. I'm sure you will not even think about awkwardness after that baby comes into the world. You will love having a tiny brother or sister. It will be exciting.

I am not completely ugly and i am skinny so its not like i am the grim reaper or something. I remember one time this guy told me he liked me and i liked him too so the next day i asked him out and he said no. i asked why he said no since he told me that he liked me and he said because you are a lot taller then me. But i realized that if the guy u like can't get over the fact that you are tall, they aren't the right guy for you. The guy you wanna be with should be the person how looks past your height.<br>  <br>  P.S I was wondering how old you are. I am in the 7th grade (13).

BLsdUBfIaa	OK, wow!! All these questions don't really cut it out for you do they?!?<br>  <br>  LoL, anyways to answer your question, if your looking for MOVIE perfect, good luck, your going to need it!!<br>  <br>  If your looking for ordinary, yet charming way to ask her out, keep reading!!<br>  <br>  Ok, well you may not think what I have to say below isn't what your looking for, but you NEED to know this before you ask her out. <br>  <br>  OK, so she has a trust issue, hopefully you've thought about why she has a trust issue. If you haven't well, think again, because something like this might come up between you two somewhere. <br>  <br>  Maybe she has a trust issue because another guy had hurt her, and you said that she won't go anywhere without a friend.<br>  <br>  BUT maybe she's just shy, and doesn't want to be alone with a guy. Because then she won't have anyone else to talk to if things got a little awkward. Or she thinks that she might freeze up if she's alone with a guy, especially with a guy that she likes!!!<br>  <br>  Something there you NEED to think about if you really care about her. If your going to be her boyfriend at least think about why she might have a trust issue or maybe think of ways to let her go loose and shed that SHY face. <br>  <br>  I think that you should do a one on one, yeah, maybe it'll be kinda hard but it's DEFINITELY better if you do it this way. And if you really want to SWEEP HER OFF HER FEET, then make sure you have a good amount of time to do this.  <br>  <br>  When you got her one on one, take a deep breath and ask her out flat out. She'll MOST LIKELY be a little stunned and surprised. TAKE THIS CHANCE to explain some things before she says something. <br>  <br>  Explain to her how much you care about her, and how much you admire her. Talk about why you want her to be your girlfriend. <br>  <br>  LET ME TELL YOU, the girls LOVE it when you tell them WHY you want them!! LoL, but really tell her. OK, so it may be a little hard but think about it.<br>  <br>  Are you going to risk her NOT being your girlfriend because you CAN'T tell her why you like her SO MUCH?!?!<br>  <br>  What's more important to you?<br>  <br>  Anyways, girls like it when you tell them WHY you want them to be your girlfriend because it makes them feel SPECIAL!!<br>  If you want YOUR girl to feel special, work on how your going to say it.<br>  <br>  Another thing, before you actually ask her, think about how your going to say it to her. If you do it at the last minute your going to freeze up because they're so many things you want to tell her but it's all unorganized and messy in your head you won't know what to say first.<br>  <br>  If you really care about her, then you WILL take the time to think about how your going to say it to her. If your unwilling to think about it, then I don't really think you care about her that much. <br>  <br>  If you DO organize this and plan it out, it'll maybe tell her that you put alot of thought into it, and you really wanted to make it special for her.<br>  <br>  After you've told her everything that you've wanted to say ask her out again incase she lost the point of the whole conversation. <br>  <br>  (girls will tend to do that when you go on an all out lovey-dovey explosion)<br>  <br>  And maybe add that you did put A LOT of thought into trying to make it special for her. If you tell her that you WANTED it to be special then that'll REALLY impress her!!<br>  <br>  Anyways, if you have anymore problems or questions to ask, just email me for sure!!<br>  <br>  babikrystalrose@yahoo.com|`|IVPZkJnvaa	"Hey, you wanna go out tonight?

I know this is probably not what you want to hear but I think you'll look back on this years from now and realize the what the right decision was.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I'm 20, and have been married for 2 and a half years...so to each their own, lol.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	I think it is fine. You guys seem mature enough to handle the situation, and your moving in together this summer which allows you to get to know one another better. I say go for it if you are ready. If you are awaiting him to ask you than I believe you are ready. It can work out if you guys want it bad enough. Don't listen to what others say because every relationship is not the same and waiting to get married for a year or two sounds like a good idea gives you guys time to build up money, house, ideas,etc.|`|l5Q8lq35aa	I personally believe it is completely acceptable if you know what<br>  you're getting yourself into; you both need to be responsible enough<br>  to be in a marital relationship. Remember, this is a lifelong commitment!  Consider the following:<br>  <br>  Money, bills, work (Will you have time for each other? Is one working<br>  while the other is at home? Who pays the bills? Whose MONEY<br>  is spent for groceries, shopping, vacation, and again bills? Do you<br>  agree, will this cause problems? What about health care? The car?<br>  The mortgage?)<br>  <br>  School (Will we have supportive careers? Are we too busy<br>  juggling school and work and a social life?)<br>  <br>  Kids (What if I get pregnant? What about school? What about<br>  money? Do the both of you agree to having kids when one<br>  wants a baby? Will we have enough money saved up for a<br>  baby and possible complications? Can we both love the baby<br>  and equally do our jobs disciplining? Who picks up the child<br>  from daycare when he/she gets older?)<br>  <br>  Financial (Have you saved up any money for emergency reasons?<br>  Are you both responsible with money? <br>  <br>  The Obvious (Do I, grey-haired, picture myself sitting next<br>  to him on the porch swing watching our grandchildren play in<br>  the yard? Do I picture myself with this man for the rest of my life,<br>  through the fights and agreements? Does the family approve?<br>  What about wedding costs? Wedding planning?) <br>  <br>  Social life (What about clubbing or partying with my friends?<br>  Is it immature; will my partner feel like I am with other men<br>  at the time? Will I have the urge to act like a teen and have<br>  fun by flirting around with my friends?)<br>  <br>  So talk this through with your partner if you do get engaged. Does he seem to blow it all off because it's too 'early' to even consider? <br>  Weigh the possibilities and always be prepared for the bumpy <br>  roads. You can shape your marriage however you like; it's <br>  all up to you both. Anyway, I wish you the best of luck and sorry<br>  for ranting on about all of this. It really, truly is what gets couples<br>  to divorce, and it is really important. <br>  <br>  But you know it never hurts to wait. At this age, we are<br>  all still discovering ourselves and the paths we choose<br>  determine who we are. If you like, you could wait it out<br>  and see how things go. True love CAN wait: that's the<br>  point of a mature and more 'successful' marriage. <br>  <br>  Anyway, congrats on finding 'the one' and I hope your life may be filled with<br>  wonderful blessings. :-)|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I'll be engaged at 19/20. So no, I don't think it's too young. Engagement and marriage aren't about age - they're about maturity.|`|6mBpkt3Daa	Yeah, I think you should have more years of "you time," and no guy or kids to care about for a good while, ya know????|`|cCymTwdcaa	You're only to young when you have to ask. Calendar age has no baring on developmental age, so if you are both employed, living on your own, have your own car or cars, love and support each other fully, then there isn't any reason for you not to get married. I'll be married this September at 20, nearly 21. By the time of the wedding, my mister and I would have known each other nearly seven years, been friends for nearly six, been together nearly four, and engaged for two =]|`|29I8PWrxaa	You know, when I was your 19 I felt the same way.  My boyfriend at the time (now my ex) and I had been together for four years by then and were starting to talk about getting married ... although we would have waited for the wedding until I graduated University.  But am I ever glad I didn't get engaged to him!  We broke up two years later because we grew apart and into two different people by the time we were in our 20's.  <br>  <br>  I think you should wait a little longer and get engaged in a few years if you are still together and things are going well.  There's no rush!  Just finish your education and then start talking about it.|`|cIBqQ0QEaa	Age is just a number. Only the two of you and your feelings for each other along with your relationship can determine when you're ready to be married. Just, please, be prepared. Marriage is tough. You have to be able to know that you can put him before yourself and that he will put you before himself. You'll learn though.. Best of luck!|`|884v4VhGaa	If you think you're old enough to move in together then you obviously feel you're ready to commit. If you're ready to commit why wouldn't you get engaged and even married?|`|pfjxEZBmaa	I don't think it is honestly. My ex was 17 and I was 19. THAT'S too young. But 18 and over I don't think is an issue. Wait to get married sure, but its fine. You are old enough to drive, old enough to have a job and old enough to vote.|`|wqRwSaGSaa	im engaged at 16. <br>  people think its bad. but iv had a hard lifestyle and were both scared i wont make it to 25. <br>  so we figured were going to do it when we can. so we can live a lil before life goes.|`|60f46466d2dd728810388e09955b9b12aa	we r married at 18 and 20.but even after marriage we continued our studies ,got  decent jobs,bought house,then we had a baby at 22and 24.<br>  u should aim at ur future with ur kids,if u r financially independent,then go ahead.|`|ewuyoA2Qaa	you know there a tv show on mtv called engaged and underage|`|pLoar8iLaa	Only you can answer this question. Not anyone here online, or anyone on some reality tv show on mtv, or your friends, or even your family.<br>  If you think you are making a mature and responsible decision in moving in with your boyfriend then you should be able to make that decision whether both of you are ready to get married. Just please make sure you are ready.<br>  Don't let the excitement of moving in together and the thought of the wedding to make you think you're ready. Think about it for a long time. Please.|`|EBkfpJkJaa	My wife and I were married when she was 16 and I was 18, Its only to young if you feel it is too young for you. Don't let your age overpower your heart, if you love the guy and you know you want to spend the rest of your life with him then in my opinion you are not to young, if you feel like you want to party and have a good time or maybe just not sure what you want in life then i would probably wait a little while longer.|`|QQgftTxxaa	I don't think so, I just moved in with my boyfriend and we were both 18 but I just turned 19 and he is turning 19 this month. We have been dating a little over two years. I already have my engagement ring picked out and we are planning a trip and he keeps saying we need to stop by kays before we leave so I dont know but we were going to do the same thing, just wait a little before we actually get married.|`|gmJAKYTlaa	it's not too young to be engaged. It's too young to get married. It's too early. You haven't seen enough of the world to make that decision. So many things are gonna come up and you'd wish you would have waited. I saw a case like this on divorce court, and they were engaged, she was 19, and he was 25.... she told them to wait. I think it's good advice. You gotta get your finances right, your healthcare... so many stuff... But also, sometimes, these things do work, i'll admit, but i advice against it.|`|NXYJxnc0aa	I think it's too young. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 5 years and I am 21. 21 is even too young for me.. I do expect to get engaged though between 22-23.. When we both are done with school and have stable jobs. I think thats the most important thing. If you aren't going to school do what you will with your life. But if you have goals, maybe you should accomplish some first before rushing into things.|`|o23MmGOOaa	I don't think anyone can say it is to young or not as we do not know you or your partner personally. it depends on the maturity of the couple and if you are willing to work at something for a long time. if you are unsure - don't do it, you have plenty of time for engagments later - it is a big decision.|`|PytiHWE5aa	if you really love this man and you really want to be with him go for it my parents got married when they were really young my mom was your age but my dad was 22 but they also waited a year to get married though and they are still together what really comes down to is what you want good luck i hope it goes good for you|`|wRHhpanmaa	ummm no not at all. I met my husband the night I turned 17, and we got married three months later. Now 6 years later, I have a wonderful marriage, and a beautiful little boy to show for it. If you know that he is the right person, and you honestly know that you love him without a doubt, then honey, age isnt anything but a bunch of numbers.|`|qPOTth0aaa	I got married at 19 and was married for 15 years. We are divorced now, but are best friends. We divorced because the intimacy element went away and our relationship turned into siblings/best friends type thing and wasn't ever coming back, and neither of us was ready to give up on having intimacy for the rest of our lives. I think that if you feel that it is too young, then it is too young. I think this is so dependent on the person and not on the age that the question becomes very difficult for anyone but you to answer. The thing to remember is that you are both still growing, and both still turning into your adult selves. I know it doesn't feel like it, but it's true. The man I divorced and the man I married were two totally different people. They're both people I love with all my heart, but they--just like me--are not the same. Sometimes people grow together, sometimes they grow in different directions.
krQiDGCHaa	Most likely not.  Here is what it boils down to in my opinion:<br>  <br>  APPROPRIATE: Looking up an old flame on facebook, myspace, etc just for the sake of viewing their profile to see what they look like, or how they're doing at this point in their life.  In other words, you're curious.<br>  <br>  INAPPROPRIATE: Adding this person as a friend, talking to them, exchanging e-mail addresses or phone numbers, etc.  I feel that is just asking for trouble.|`|YFuIOVq0aa	two things bother me about the question<br>  <br>  1. "I found"  why did you feel it necessary to look and why would this not be something she would talk to you about in the first place.<br>   Communication seems to be an issue ?<br>  <br>  2. you posted the Q on YA and apparently didn't talk to your wife about it  - or you would already have the answer<br>  <br>  In fact, my opinion is not important - nor are any others except your wife's and how you feel.<br>  <br>  talk to her, with her|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	maybe she was just checking it out..could always ask her about it|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Not unless she's posting comments or oogling over his pictures. I have looked at my ex's page just to see what is going on in his life. That doesn't mean I want to be with him or still have feelings. My boyfriend is actually friend's with his ex online. I don't like it but I know that he just wants to be civil - not that he wants her.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	if her being interested in another man worries you|`|uO0NW2nZaa	yes worry big time|`|0wdEcNk1aa	No, myspace is simply an internet social club, it is okay for her to say hello to whomever is on there. Besides which, if her ex is anything like me, he probably doesn't ever go through and modify his friends list anyway.|`|NGKwsawdaa	I don't know, did your wife and her ex stay friends after their breakup, if so, then no I don't think that you should be worried|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Absolutely. Confront her and possibly dump her. She's not over him or she wouldn't be checking up on him.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Only if she has given you a reason to be.|`|XF9XNvrjaa	ask her. confront her about it.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	be cautious, ask her about it, let her know you know.|`|uFmrZbCbaa	if she hasn't started to treat you any different why should you|`|U2YK6lcJaa	oh yeah i would be|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	talk to her about it, tell her how you feel.  Open the lines of communication up with her,  some couples are secure and its no problem, but some there is some infidelity issues in one or boths pasts that contribute to this insecurity.  I would not like it, I dealt with it with an ex, and found out he had been talking sexually with his ex's throughout our relationship, for 2.5 years.  Its wrong to keep ones foot in someones door. Close the door, open the door to the future, not the past!|`|AA11843514	Yeah, I would.  I'd ask her what's up with that?  She will probably say nothing but watch and see if she will look you in the eyes.  If she gets nervous, then somethings up.  I hope you have a relationship built on communication cause if you can't talk about it openly, lies will come next.|`|tMXS76XWaa	dont be worried! im not married but i have a boyfriend and i looked at my ex's page once just to see how pathetic he is now. your the one with the ring just remember that, dont be worried your just stressing over something silly. she loves you...hes her ex for a reason.|`|an7qtWORaa	I am on my ex husbands friends list. I rarely talk to him only if I want to say hi or something. My brother is on an exgirlfriends account and he talks about how bad she looks but he enjoys being her Facebook friend.

l5Q8lq35aa	I think it's absolutely adorable if a guy became nervous especially <br>  around me! I say make your move; if she doesn't accept you for YOU,<br>  then don't even think on it! She's not worth it if you have to change <br>  your sweet personality. If she does accept you, you'll gradually get<br>  use to talking to her. Don't sweat it; make your move.

A lot of<br>  girls do this while flirting or getting to know you, so never<br>  feel embarrassed no matter what her actions are saying.<br>  I'm usually thinking something totally different, like "He's<br>  so cute when he's embarrassed. I love his smile, too!"|`|gV9KgNctaa	Aww this sounds so cute <br>  U should really like not care anymore because I used to turn bright red around this one guy then I just decided I won't care and we ended up being friends<br>  <br>  Like just don't think to much about it|`|i7g3IU2Maa	Just take deep breaths and that's it|`|DYH49qGxaa	chicks like guys who are confident (but not overly confident) if its really that much of a problem just remind yourself, if you don't think about being nervous you most likely won't be nervous

dwzfjlJraa	I would recommend joining a martial arts class with him or somthing active.

I felt obligated to awnser this because I too was molested by my step father, and I told the authorities and my mom turned against me.  I haven't spoke to her in almost 5 years but I am married and have a 3 year old little girl whom I saved from being molested and I was lucky enough to get psychologiical help because I told, which is way worth it.  On the other hand my sister was much younger when he started molesting her and was very afraid to tell, so she now is the mother of his two little girls and she just turned 20, now those children have to be around him and he will probabily do the same thing to them.  I know it is hard but you have to encourage her to TELL.  Now, don't wait just tell a teacher or someone at school, don't let her mother guilt her because they may be mad now but she is saving her younger siblings in the long run.

napgiSmXaa	Hi FFV11Freak<br>  <br>           Have you tried explaining how you feel to your Fiance.  Just how low her Mums comments are making you feel and how you don't think she, your Fiance, understands or even cares how you're feeling.<br>            If not, you might like to try.  If you have and you still feel the same way.  Then for your own protection I think you know what you've got to <br>  do.  Difficult though it is you have got to think in the long term, if she wont back you up then, perhaps her feelings for you have changed  and she's looking for a way out.   <br>            Good luck and God Bless you both!|`|AA12262106	Unfortunately you brought this on yourself.<br>     The mother -in- law is notorious for being a tricky relationship. One of the reasons for that is what you're experiencing right now. A mother always wants the best for her child and you've given her an opportunity to see how much you can hurt her daughter.<br>     You could have explained to her until you were blue in the face, the bottom line is that you hurt her daughter. Just like interfering with a bear cub will get the mother really riled up, you have aroused your mother-in-law's ire and have to suffer the consequences.<br>     I'd advise you to just ignore her comments.

xwm5JZCkaa	I think you secretly, deep down, have feelings for him. That's ok. What you dream about is about stuff in your life and/or you feelings, so take this as a wake up call. You aren't going crazy! If it felt real, chances are you probably wanted it to feel real. There's nothing wrong with that. Maybe you really don't hate him as much as you think you do.<br>  <br>  What if you know that deep deep deep deep down that you don't like him at all and will hate him forever? <br>  <br>  It was just a dream.

URGhWo4Kaa	Hi<br>  I am assuming that you have done all your homework and are like "Yeah! I do want to go out with him".<br>  <br>  Its very simple. Ask him out. Believe me, guys like to be asked out by girls. Even if he doesn't agree, you guys will get started saying 'Hi, Hellos'. That would be a start you can work along.<br>  <br>  If its too bold for you, get to him via friends who may know him or have friends who know him .. u get the idea..<br>  OR <br>  Search for him in social networking sites (orkut, facebook etc). Post a friendly message like 'Hi, I am from your school and find you interesting.'. Something like that.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is - You Have To INITIATE.<br>  Most people don't initiate cause they fear rejection. That the other party will say NO. So what?!

13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	I'm 15.  What's it like to be 24?|`|PPDFSAY6aa	I can honestly say as a 33 year old woman, that the difference in being 24 and 33 is almost nothing!! I do find myself wishing to be younger again, but for what? I think i've found that at my age things i once thought important really aren't. I believe i'm much more wiser in relationships, and what i want from a man in my life, as what i use to think was important, like looks first.  Because a sexy man is usually a jerk, but a man easy on the eyes, but makes me laugh is much better.  Hence my husband of 8 years this month.  I never felt more comfortable with anyone in my life!  You are only as old as you feel, and with three kids and at the age of 33 i feel like i'm 21!|`|GPOxaBM5aa	Nothing really fells different. I don't fell old and I don't feel like a grown up. It's usually different for women, particularly if they aren't married and don't have children. But the early 30s are usually the best years of a SINGLE man's life.|`|VH4YeaZYaa	It is whatever you make it! :)|`|77uc2xXUaa	Listen to BabeHeart, she's smart|`|AA11447210	It's whatever you make it...same as 24 or 46 or 58. What it's like depends on the life of the person at that age...what it will be like for you will depend on where you are in your life in 6 yrs.<br>  <br>  Thirty was "eh" for me...got better later in my 30s.
BZzWlI6eaa	If I were you I would wait, because it takes time to heal after a serious relationship is over (I just ended a long-term relationship myself so I know how it feels). He probably needs a bit more time to himself (which is probably why he wants two more months of being single). You don't have to date other guys. Just tell him that you're willing to wait because you like him a lot and you think you guys will work out, and see what he says|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	2 months is nothing in a lifetime if he is indeed THE one :)<br>  Give him some time, he didn't say that you guys should keep distance during those 2 months neither so go out have some fun together with common friends and hopefully he will make up his mind. don't pressure him or he may go further away!|`|d55czOsQaa	YOUR GAY!!??? :O|`|FgRiw5CLaa	if u want to be with him wait cuz its hard to get out of a serious relationship
exZfJsDGaa	I would ask her why she did not tell you that off the bat... either way.. it sounds like she would be stuck in a love triangle.. with you and the other guy so I would not stick around... shes giving herself too much importance now.. dip set on  her azz|`|qGDWbJKpaa	If you have any feeling in your heart that she might break up with the other dude, i would stick with her. She could become your best friend and whenever her and her dude broke up, you could get a chance. I wouldnt stop talking to her or anything like that, i would still hang out with him and stuff like that.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Remember: you're SINGLE.<br>  <br>  Act like it.|`|5qgL2Dtlaa	k, im not a guy. but honey, if this is really happening, she is totally into you and you have to keep fighting for her because you obviously seem to really like, if not love this girl. <br>  so yea, i say go for it|`|qcIfeNFXaa	Well to be honest, I wouldn't talk to anyone I don't know in the first place :)|`|68b44e1447cd07a05f63d57f1733c707aa	It's only been 2 weeks...give it some time.  If she is still talking to this other guy after a month or two you need to tell her you want to be more than just MU/friends.  If she doesn't reciprocate then she is wasting your time.  Clearly she is....she has been dragging this other along for a year.|`|fw5gKggZaa	I know you wanted a guys advice. But from a girls point of view, I'd say trust her. She trusts you enough to tell you about him, so that she can be completely honest. That's a good thing.<br>  <br>  I'd say that she likes you, and if you give her a chance then it'll work out.|`|UGAZhGqJaa	listen boss you can always date her and ask her to break it off with the other dude and like be happy with her or maybe you could move on, maybe find some whores to spend some time with and then you just might find the right girl for you.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	keep courting her<br>  you are not doing anythng wrong<br>  she may pick  you<br>  or may not<br>  but at least you will have some good memories of her<br>  life is too short to not have fun<br>  she seems like a girl who knows how to be fun|`|HQ4t7JfGaa	il be soooo piss'd  i mean that the dream girl yet il let her decide who to choose|`|78GfHPEKaa	Should have told him from jump...he thinks ur playin games|`|DJ4y1QkCaa	Well if I didn't know in the first place that you were seeing another guy.  That would probably bother me a little bit.  But I don't think it would cause me to not talk to you anymore.  I think that if after a year of seeing someone you still weren't "officially" together than it's just a friendship and that's all it would ever be unless you felt sorry for the guy and didn't want him to think you led him on for a year.  So I would say that the girl would definitely feel kinda bad but in the end she would end up going with this new guy.  As for myself I'm not really good at sharing.  I would try at first of course but after a period of time there would have to be a choice by the girl.<br>  <br>  hope this helps....|`|lwXGNizGaa	How important is she to you?  Honestly, it's hard to go up against someone who has a full year's head start on you -- that's a strong bond.  If you think this is someone who could really be important to you long-term then don't give up just because there's some competition. On the other hand, if you're at all unsure you might want to think about moving on.  Do you really want to work so hard to win a girl who pits you against another man?  She sounds a little manipulative and maybe not worth the trouble.|`|rPOgAYrfaa	what is this M.U. crap. i don't get it. either you're sleeping with him or not. if the girl was sleeping with a guy i would feel like i'm getting a little used or at least played with...you need to give this guy some sort of assurance that you actually want him...even if you are a good girl.|`|aYsoe2gpaa	keep courting her.<br>  <br>  I mean, someone like that doesn't come along every day, or even often at all. Chances are that the other guy is not going to be around long anyway.Once the girl finds her true love, then that will be that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't lose sight of true love.|`|jY28SNtcaa	I've been in this situation, and it sucks. I would have to say that i you do have this connection and you feelings for the new guy are stronger see were that goes.|`|jpnTdAQfaa	Well i would say, I would definitely go ahead with the girl , And i would most likely want to go ahead with this relationship as in mingle more and find out about each other , only considering the fact that she isn't happy with her existing relationship and knowing that she would leave him for me..Or she can also be searchin for some emotional and mental comfort in you as a friend or maybe more than that coz her boy aint giving her attention, you could be a tool and when u ask her out she might just say she wasnt interested in you for a relationship in the first place and u could end up wasting time on her..Go ahead only if you think it isnt a waste of your resources(money, time , emotions)...rest is all upto you, best of luck !
iPNOVR6Gaa	Why would you reward her for going on benders by bailing her out?  Here's a tip for you: if you want someone to stop doing something, it is always a mistake to reward that behavior.<br>  <br>  PS - I wish you'd asked a question.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	While I understand some of what you're going through, as I have been there myself, I am unsure of what your actual question is.  A little more info, please?|`|bO2rzfISaa	You're in a relationship with her, but she's in a relationship with alcohol.|`|de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	You shouldn't allow her to treat you like a doormat.<br>  <br>  Go find a healthy relationship with someone who possesses potential.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	I absolutely love beer drinking women, as my wife hates drinking period.  Trade wives anytime?|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	I would leave that situation. Today....|`|uXdx9vuBaa	welcome to addiction land.  She is an addict to alcohol and like all drug addicts, sex addicts, internet addicts, and alcholoics, they must admit to themselves first they have a problem and wnat to get help on thier own.  If you have tried numerous times to help her out and she keeps doing it then you have no altimatum. You have to end the relationship when you are ready or she will drain you out mentally and exhaust you. DOesnt mean you have to stop loving her but maybe once she is on her own for a long time, she will clean up her act. She may never do so just remember this but at least you will have peace of mind.  Ifyou have kids with this woman, its best to move on and think of them and devote your life to them and yourself.    Now if you arent married, you are lucky and can move on with your life and meet someone in the future who doesnt have any addictions. I was in a relationship for two years with someone who was a sex addict and it was horrible. I didnt realize how mentally drained i was after two years and it was hard ending it b/c i really loved him. Now almost three years later i met someone who is normal and has good morals.  What a relief it is to be with someone you can trust and enjoy times together.  I would never go back to this other guy and he even emailed me to get back with him years later.  Never.  Be strong and keep your head up. People with addictions are fun to be with and are ususally good in bed but trust me, it all falls apart sooner or later b/c they cant get a grip on their emotions or devote /commit to someone on a normal level.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Alcohol will always be her number one while she is still drinking.  In fact even if she manages to give up she will still have to battle not drinking everyday.<br>  <br>  She has a dependency whether she likes it or not and there will be times when she goes off on benders and times when she is sober for weeks.<br>  <br>  If you want this to work, she will need to give up the drink - if you give her an ultimatum she will choose the drink over you.  She needs to stop for herself, be there as a friend, don't bail her out, you are helping her drink by doing this.  <br>  <br>  Good luck it will be an uphill struggle|`|jd4MzIYtaa	unfortunatley if she has that attitude, nothing is going to change. She doesnt believe she has a problem. My aunt recently passed away due to alcoholism. She had 6 kids and was married to my grandpa who treated her like a princess. She had everything she could ever want and still she drank the bottle and no matter how much they tried to help, it wasnt enough. You are in a tough situation because she needs you but at the same time doesnt want to admit she has a problem. You can only do so much for a person. Ultimatley it is up to them to want to make the change. I am sorry you are in the situation you are in. MAybe have a n intervention or get her into rehab. Give her an ultimatum that if she doesnt get help your a done. It may or may not help but it seems like you are at the last straw.Good luck|`|7i6qj4OXaa	My friend was in a relationship with a man who was an alcoholic and could never understand why he wouldn't give up the drink in favour of her love.  I kept on telling her 'he can't, and that is the truth.  An alcoholic has to do it for themselves because they have hit rock bottom.  If you keep taking her back you are enabling her to continue.  For her sake you should cut her loose.  She will never decide to do it whilst she has support.  I know it will be hard for you but try to be strong and do it.|`|5R9d1U2Iaa	she doesn't want you,help, or to change.  you need to leave. it doesn't matter how much you love her, or if you love her you need to leave.  she will ruin your life.|`|rp46MQKeaa	lave the relationship you will always come 2nd to the drink.<br>  If you are strong enough you could be just a friend to her and endorses this by finding a new partner|`|wY3fMViqaa	Show him how he's hurting you and his family. He can't change unless he decides to change himself.|`|naequcqlaa	I can tell you from "first hand" experience that you should do some serious thinking about staying in this relationship.  Alcoholism is a progressive DISEASE & is NOT going to get better, is going to only get worse.  It's a "legal" drug & it kills in the end!  I AM a recovering alcoholic, was married to a couple "exs" who were also alcoholics until I could no longer accept the things that were being done against me, to me, & that hurt terribly.  I have been clean & sober for 18 yrs. now, attended AA for litterly yrs. & also attended Alanon.  Her actions are NOT going to get any better, they are just going to get worse.  Keep this VERY important fact in mind.  I do not care how much you love her, you do NOT have the power that alcohol does.  There is NO way you're going to be able to control it, control her.  Go to a couple Alanon mtgs. & just listen to the stories they tell.  I KNOW you'll hear your "own" story be told.  I've always said, AA saved my life, Alanon saved my sanity.  She is just going to keep doing what she's doing, BUT it's going to progressivly just get worse.  By "bailing" her out, you're actually "enabeling" her to drink & she is always going to keep running back to her to "save" her.  I lived w/it, I too well know the position you're in.  I had an ex husband who ALWAYS came running back to me because "you can help me".  Well, I finally got to the point where I ACCEPTED the fact that regardless of what I did, it was NOT helping him whatsoever.  I was just an emabeler.  I learned this thru the programs I went to for litterly yrs.  I learned SO MUCH & just what to do & what not to do.  As long as you "allow" her to control you, she's going to do just that.  She's "married" to alcohol, it's her way of life.  Please please do serious thinking about this.  You are NOT helping her.  The best very BEST thing you could do would be to let her go.  She's got to hit her "bottom" to be able to realize she DOES need serious help..By you bailing her out every time, you're actually hindering her from reaching her "bottom" which w/in turn keep her from getting the TRUE HELP she needs.  Yes, it does sound cold, but it's actually called "tough love".  Do you care enuf about her to let her go so she can get the REAL need she so badly needs instead of using you as a crutch keeping her from falling & reaching the bottom she needs in order to cry out & give in to get the help she needs.  I mean this in all sincerity & w/do ANYTHING in my power to HELP another alcoholic find sobriety.  Help her by getting up the nerve, the courage to use tough love w/her?  Do you care enuf that she finds a way to free herself from this horrible destructive killing disease?  I took my ex to every single detox in our area that accepted people w/no ins.  He bounced back & forth in & out of the program.  I can truly thank God that HE helped me to be able to be willing to do whatever I needed to do to be sober.  Now 18+ years I AM sober.  My kids are so happy to have their mom back again.  I can be there for THEM, I couldn't before.  I realized just how much I was not only hurting myself, but I was also hurting my children that I love so much.  I now have them back & was never happier.  PLEASE think of ALL I've said.  Every word of it is truth.  If I can help ANYONE get the sobriety I now have, I have to give my best to help them.  We're taught in AA that in order to "keep it", we have to "give it away".  By giving it away, reminds me of the days when I was hurting so badly & hurting all the ones I truly loved.  IF I can do this for someone else, it's my responsibility as a sober person today to try my best to give what others gave to me.  You've got to stop being her "enabeler" & cut off the soft cushion you're allowing her to land on every time she goes out & runs back to you.  I KNOW you do not mean to, but you're actually doing the opposite thing of what you should be doing.  Let her take responsibility for her drinking & suffer the consequences.  This is the ONLY way she's going to have a chance of getting sober.  Please do yourself a BIG favor & look up Alcohol in the yellow pages.  Ask them for the closest Alanon mtgs. near you.  Please go to just a few mtgs. & you'll meet the finest, caring bunch of people you'd want to know.  They also w/be more than willing to help you & you in turn w/be helping her.  Things were meant to happen for a reason, I'm a firm believer in that.  IF I answered your post for a reason, then it was NOT done in vane.  Alcoholism is a very cunning disease, we w/do everything in our power to use every excuse in the book just for our rite to drink.  Please do everything in YOUR power to help her put down that drink.  I'm totally serious in everything I've said to you.  I only trust you w/take it all to heart so you can help her, not enabel her...I DO wish you ALL the very best...you CAN DO IT....DO IT...:)|`|f46e4d06264af7098985992a39f2c379aa	Get out! My dad is an alcoholic and i know from experience it is not a good thing to have a parent that is an alcoholic! Bad idea! You get in relationships to find out who you want to marry and marrying and then procreating with an alcoholic is not a smart and/or responsible choice!|`|E4tsKFMMaa	First, find an AL-ANON group for yourself.  They will be a huge support system for you.  I was married to someone who became an addict, slightly different but totally the same in that you are in an unhealthy codependent relationship.  She depends on you to be there to bail her out so you keep doing it.  Because of her addiction you feel that all you can do to help her is bail her out.  It will be a vicious cycle until you leave and/or she gets help.  Good luck to you!|`|uV1zixmBaa	Ask her to go to alcoholics anonymous.

o0JOTzj0aa	You need to ask him for specific examples of times when you made him feel like this, so you know what he's talking about.  Once you see your behaviour through his eyes you may realise he has a point/  Maybe you've not been the most considerate of his feelings?  If he felt strongly enough to break up with you, you must have unwittingly been neglecting his feelings.  Do you pay more attention to other blokes than you should etc?  <br>  When he's told you this, would he be prepared to give you a chance to realise your mistake and modify your behaviour?  <br>  If not, learn from where you went wrong here and realise that peopole we love will come and go so while we have them, we need to put them absolutely first in our lives.  It's his decision and if he feels there's no way back, you'll need to find a way to let him go.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	Nothing.

He is breaking up with you for his own reasons and i think, in order to get him back, you have to ask him what you can do to make it work. He might just need some time! And he's missing out. If he really loves you he'd be willing to talk about it. You can't fix this with gifts, you have to talk to him. Tell him to give you another chance and tell him if it doesn't get better than it's his desission, but tell him you would do anything to make him happy and be with him. Let him know that you're willing to make sacrifices for him, but also tell him that if he needs space or more time with you your willing to give it to him. <br>  <br>  If you truly love him, that should be enough, but give him reason to give you another chance.

Also, how would the police know it was precisely the encounter during which she was assaulted? The DA would drop the charges, not the police.  Totally unbelievable.<br>  <br>  What's even scarier is why he would make up a story like this. Was he trying to frighten or impress you?

It was cool. :)|`|VWXXmL74aa	Yes|`|USooqQlWaa	I wonder if I've ever given that look...|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Hey..stop staring at me and my hubby...your starting to tell away all my secrets..<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes!|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Yes<br>  <br>  SteveC
gO9tl2uhaa	There isn't much you can do...<br>  <br>  It's usually a matter of time and sorting out your feelings and thoughts.<br>  <br>  My only advices would be don't stay friend or close to him, stop seeing him if anything; you'll get over him "faster". And, just let it out. Cry as much as you need. If you keep it in, it just won't help.<br>  <br>  Finish the closure properly.|`|TcrM1GlOaa	to be honest mamas<br>  there is no way on stopping tears from falling from someone u love<br>  wat u can do is<br>  find a h obby or something to distract u from feeling pain <br>  over the break up<br>  u no<br>  play a sport <br>  pick up a job or just doo something u really like<br>  that way u wont have to think of him<br>  there for u wont want to cry<br>  cuz ull forget <br>  good luck=]]|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Let your feelings out, and talk to your close friends and people you trust.<br>  From what it sounds like there, he's not a very nice person, and he's messing with you by breaking up with you twice effectively.<br>  If he doesn't realise how special and unique you are, and he doesn't appreciate you, then just move on, and keep going forward, and think about yourself and what you want in life and work for it.<br>  You can find tons of people better than him. If it doesn't work out, just accept it, and move on. Accepting is an important skill that is usually learnt through experience, but it's difficult to master. However, realise you are worth more than him, and don't let it get you down, because you deserve better, and one day you will find your true love.|`|8rfEU7Rlaa	im with you on that to my boyfriend broke up with me last fri. and i still cry over him he said it was cause of his grades but really it was because of he thought i was using him to get to his friends and thats bull and i got a txt saying he just wanted to be friends and to stop crying over him i let go and walked up to him and said i love you still but i need to let go of you and move on and until you come back to me while i sit here we need to movve on and yes i will wait for you but you need to speek up !|`|E0KhrgnSaa	awww I'm sorry. He is kind of a jerk for breaking up with you after a year's relationship via the text message. <br>  But, to stop hurting over this....only time can heal all wounds. In the meantime focus on things that make you happy, get into some hobbies, get a haircut, keep your mind, body and spirit focused on something positive. You'll get over it, and you will meet other guys, trust me. Feel better and good luck.

You nor any of these guys seem like someone who's ready to provide this child with any sort of stability. Would you want her to grow up to be just like you? Do this baby a favor and hand her off to someone and go have fun.

I can tell.|`|AA10700606	One more word - Whore|`|Gql7tFXFaa	your 17... why on earth would you be a) sleeping around, 2) sleeping around with a bunch of guys who are friends and there is obviously a conflict of interest and c) Lie about being pregnant??????<br>  <br>  I suggest you seek some professional counselling and think really hard about sleeping with the next guy you date.... especially if it's only been a month since your last relationship.Try getting to know them mentally not physically.<br>  <br>  I also strongly suggest getting a pap test and STI check if you're going to continue this kind of thing.<br>  <br>  My only other advice is TELL THEM THE TRUTH! you got yourself into this situation, so what if they all end up hating you, you'll learn from it and move on.|`|wE44NUPuaa	i suggest you go and get a pregency test and if this guy really loved you he would stay with you yes you are 18 but think about the consequences..and no im not saying if you are pregnant get and abortion beacuse i dont believe in abortion or giving away the child if you already finished highschool start college and provide the baby a good life ig that guy isnt going to be in your life
hkUzSsRZaa	Love comes from the heart. If you don't feel the love, the strong connection with him don't go out with him. Don't risk getting your heart broken. I had the SAME problem. I liked this guy, he liked me, he asked me out but then I said no because I wasn't ready to fall in love with someone. I found my prince charming already, my boyfriend Omar and one day you will too. Maybe this guy is not the one for you. Tell him one day you will give him the chance and go out with him. Tell him just not now.<br>  <br>  ~Hope I helped, Lexi|`|cmEi3CVqaa	what if you started seeing him but have an bit of an open relationship until you're sure that you want to be with him properly, obvs it will only work if both of u are up for it. if it doesnt work out and u find that u dont wanna be with him put it down to a bit of fun, but let him know where he stands so he doesnt get hurt or confused along the way. <br>  <br>  hope it helps.
H1qpJc6Daa	Shouldn't be a problem if you love each other.|`|z2cysiEhaa	Just the same as anyone else does.

0jUGSaZPaa	Bottom line:  Don't worry if your cake topper "clashes" with your colors, decoration, etc...  Because it's a symbolism of YOU!!  (The bride and groom)<br>  <br>  But, if you want to, the only thing I can think of is either flower petals (if it's a spring/summer wedding) or leaves... <br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8Frds361a-E/SV93BJEixwI/AAAAAAAAA9M/xIGvX1gutfI/s400/Pink+Petal+Wedding+Cake2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8Frds361a-E/SV...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.1812hitchingpost.com/wphotos/painted_fall_leaves_wedding_cake.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.1812hitchingpost.com/wphotos/...</a><br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3-NhrEYv8dA/SSGabwO5q9I/AAAAAAAAAh4/3LLNSK94X9s/s400/orange-cakes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3-NhrEYv8dA/SS...</a><br>  <br>  Despite your cake topper, I found this and thought it was pretty...<br>  <a href="http://specialevents.com/weddings/CSBlueCake2_LR.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://specialevents.com/weddings/CSBlue...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT TO ADD:  I just saw your hunting cake... How adorable!!  You can always use navy blue icing too for the edges... But the ribbon would work too... Or scatter navy blue flowers throughout the layers.  :)|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think this cake would be very pretty for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sweetdreamsweb.com/wedding%20cakes/Blue_Luster.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetdreamsweb.com/wedding%20...</a><br>  <br>  For my wedding cake, my husband is a pastry chef so he made it.  It was 5 tiers with a scalloped buttercream design, chocolate mousse flavor, and handmade fondant blush roses, ivy, and grapes.  It was beautiful.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Just have the cake layers be smoothe and white.  Use ribbon to decorate the base of each cake (maybe you can do a 2 inch navy ribbon and attach a 1/2 inch gold ribbon to the middle of the 2 inch ribbon).  Then have your cake topper on top and maybe some white flowers to decorate the base of the cake topper.  Your cake decorater will be able to do the ribbon and then have them add a beaded white icing "cover up" to the bottom of each ribboned tier.<br>  <br>  EDIT - LOL! Cute... ;)|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I think that would look really cute and would show you and your FH's personalities. I'm guessing you want to do pearls around the edges of the cakes. I would use gold or white. I think Navy Blue would be too much. Or maybe if you did Navy Blue you could put a pond or something to tie it in. Then I think the Navy Blue would look good. I don't really care for ribbon on cakes.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I think it would be cute to maybe just have a minature cake for you and the groom to cut, and then just use white sheet cake to serve your guests. A cute little square one with your topper maybe some gold detailing and possibly a quote you two like something inspired by this <a href="http://www.pinkcakebox.com/images/big-cake200.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkcakebox.com/images/big-ca...</a>|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	You chose the topper you did, your choice but do you really think pearls and ribbon will look nice with THAT?  You have to be kidding.  Why not get camouflage ribbon and orange flowers?  What are your wedding colors, please say not camo.  Go from there.  You asked our opinion, wow.|`|pk8uOZiqaa	I would have a chocolate cake with strawberries or any kind of fruit you can do anything with your wedding cake there are no rules trust me.  My mom makes wedding cakes I have seen many come and go and I think it is mainly what you like.  It's also hard to not want a piece of cake that looks beautiful and delicious!!|`|884v4VhGaa	Decorate the cake to match the cake topper, not the bridesmaids' dresses. How are your cake decorating skills? Can you decorate the cake to look as if the couple in the topper are out in an appropriate area of wilderness? Otherwise, how about something that suggests the outdoors?|`|oMEtUobVaa	I don't think you should do chocolate since the figures are wearing dark clothing...bring out the other colors in the figure with a light cake or a simple white with red and navy blue flowers and do gold pearls around the cake for your gold accents.|`|FMjsTCWTaa	I would do a really simple white cake and add a ribbon around the bottom of each tier, maybe gold ribbon.<br>  <a href="http://i540.photobucket.com/albums/gg330/nlucas1010/Mesha250JacksonGeoffMatwichWed8-9-0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i540.photobucket.com/albums/gg330...</a>|`|6dQzmsXuaa	write your name on the cake with chocolate and also make some flowers on it, if you can.|`|IURGzfnKaa	with lots and lots of chocolates i like them
JClRxC8iaa	Ok, firstly story #2 doesn't make much sense but from what I understand, you need to be more supportive of that friend. It may not seem like such a big deal to you but maybe it is to her. And as for the friend in story 1, have you tried finding out exactly why she doesn't wanna be your friend? Try asking her in person. If there is no reason, why would you want someone like that as friend anyway? And just remember that friendship is a 2 way thing.|`|nWCP91q2aa	ouch..dont sound liek good freinds to me,...get new ones
zCE0slQ5aa	bouncing, hopping and jumping around are signs of happiness, giddiness, excitement and high energy. if these characteristics are not also joined by signs of ditzyness, than yes, they are attractive behaviors.<br>  <br>  as far as grabbing a guy and pulling him close to you it is good that there is some innocent contact and communication, spoken or non-spoken, beforehand. flirting or long periods of constant eye contact preluding any physical contact is ideal for warming things up.<br>  <br>  a woman who reaches out and claims something she wants can be most unexpected, erotic and very stimulating. the manor in which it is done is key. is it sensual, or is it desperate?|`|06Z3fh4laa	What the hell is the "potty dance?"|`|wqCznap2aa	Depends. Some guys don't like girls to force themselves on guys, some do.|`|4pKu60Jlaa	What the hell is the potty dance?
iSIZMz2maa	Yeah for sure. Its annoying, especially because I know i look over 21.
AA11513781	It might work and it could back fire on you and she just stop texting and asking you to come in. Maybe she is not ready for a relationship right now. You should just be patient and wait but don't wait to long because you can be passing up someone who really wants you. At least you should text and show her some attention and she might just decide that she will go out with you. Sorry we female can be complicated sometimes lol.
PaZYsgGRaa	you have to go out to places with your guy friends and meet other girls. Go to a club or another bar and you'll meet other girls that will get you mind off her|`|Mr3112o5aa	do something that you really like to do, and nothing that you did with her, something completely different
zbFJpyMyaa	From a college student to another...you sound as frustrated as I did during my first semester. Ugh. gotta hate those days, it seems. lol. Take some time off for awhile, or maybe with this spring break. Make it like a game with yourself and start finding ways to make you, unique. Make a list of 25 things you've done in the past year because you wanted to, and this might sound ridiculous, but find out if you have any food allergies. I had a lot of those depressed, low energy and weird skin stuff and it turned out I was allergic to some stuff. Changing my diet was a pain, (I can't buy anything from a vend. machine) but I'm happier and I have more energy. And since you like being introspective, have you kept a journal? That helps to really work things through-don't worry, it gets better. Seriously-it's just up to you! Cheers!|`|c2da9d6744cd0c23d5d0b9b9300338a7aa	The main issue here is, your just focused on yourself way to much and everything is about you. I hear some depression going on also. The best advice I can give is, to go out and help someone else, even if it's to carry some groceries for them. You get self esteem by doing estimable acts. When you help others and get out of yourself, your problems will magically disappear. The big thing is do not expect anything from those you help. Do it even when doing so is something you'd rather not. You can only change your thoughts through action.<br>  I promise this works. I know|`|oRzqWhsDaa	I would say bipolar disorder you need to get into counseling and get medication and change your life before it passes you by you have to want to change even though the world seems like its just too much and you have alot of opportunities before don't wait before its too late and you will regret whatever goals you should have had and be older and just say I wish I would have given life more effort I had a bad childhood and I still persisted in wanting the best of life and I too suffered some of your symptoms.  I deal with this even being older so get some help do some volunteer work go to church and start learning to join the world.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	you sound very depressed and need to see a psychologist to get to the bottom of it. some people have tried hypnotherapy.<br>  are you eating a balanced diet?<br>  lack of certain vitamins and minerals can lead to skin disorders and insomnia
VsLSJ65Paa	Maybe he was half asleep or something.  Some guys dont care about things that make us girls hearts move. lol .|`|AA11795191	Well lets see:<br>  <br>  1.) Boys could give a crap less about what your "song" is. If its something that actually holds some meaning (like a song playing the first time you kissed or went out, then maybe. But some arbitrary song? Definitely not. <br>  2.) BOYS DONT CARE ABOUT CRAP LIKE THAT.<br>  3.) Ya know, boys really just...dont....care.|`|EkLJDcc7aa	ask him if anythings wrong when you talk later.<br>  or maybe he just had to go really quick.|`|AA12259389	maybe he was bored.|`|5eaJYUGCaa	wrong person maybe?<br>  <br>  he might have been texting somebody else..or maybe he just read your text wrong..|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	i wood as him what wong|`|K3a2fcq8aa	just ask him wats wrong..and ur being to lovey dovey guys doonnt like that:\ soo just see wats up..maybe he was busy?|`|YSoBO3tpaa	he's busy or he really just doesn't care.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	You can't just pick a "your song" it has to be something that binds you two together.<br>  <br>  Like with my youth group, we do karaoke and we have certain "our songs" like I'm a guy and I can sing My Heart Will Go On even though I've only heard them sing it.<br>  <br>  So you need to wait for a "your song"<br>  <br>  <br>  Could you answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304013720AA6zfNG&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

wCsQUZGlaa	Stop saying: "I want to be her friend", cause you know very well you wanna be more than that. She's taken, so back off; If they break up, you can make your move, but right now, you need to find another girl. If you find another girl, you'll stop thinking about her.
06YOGE1eaa	lmfao.  Pamela M.  She sounds so dumb.  I think she actually believed you.  haha.<br>  <br>  I would just leave it out and whoever is the office "food stealer" will get a good meal.

d23F89ECaa	You'll get past this person.<br>  <br>  But he'll always be a part of you.<br>  <br>  I married when I was 20.  It wasn't a mistake.  Yes, we were young and it was a rush thing but we were truly ment to be with each other.<br>  <br>  Year and a half into the marriage, which was going amazingly well, she was six months pregnant with our first child when she miscarriaged.  To the both of us, it was a terrible thing to have happen.  She literally shut down.  She didn't cry, she didn't talk about it and she didn't show anything.  Within a couple months, she stopped eating, didn't go to work, didn't even get out of bed.  I did everything I could to take care of her and support the two of us financially.  I never thought for one seccond of leaving her or that our relationship wasn't strong enough to take us through that.  Another couple months went by and she was only getting worse.  She didn't even talk to me for this time.  She had a full emotional and mental melt down and cracked.  For the interest of her health, I agreed, under the advice of several doctors to sign a divroce document and let her rebuild her life as an individual, not a young married woman.<br>  <br>  It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  That was three years ago.  she has since died from an unrelated incident I won't get into.<br>  <br>  Now, the reason I am telling you this story is, had I had the chance now to go back in time and talk to the me on his wedding day, knowing everything I know that will happen to him and all the incredible pain he will go through, all I would say to him is "You're going to love her until the day you die"<br>  <br>  The pain will stop.  You'll move on and find another.  I have.  But the person and the memory will never leave you.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	The pain will stop when you meet someone else you like.<br>  He probably feels that he is missing out on other "many women" he can meet at his stage of life, you probably feel the same thing deep inside.<br>  It is settling down and having a family and stuff is what creates a strong lasting living together/marriage life.<br>  <br>  I'd say live your life and enjoy freedom and meeting new people, if you two are meant to end up together in the future you will, and if not then you two would probably meet the perfect person for you and you'll know it.<br>  <br>  Just let it flow and enjoy life!

ZmdIlkpQaa	OK, I know I'll get lots of flak for this, but yeah, I do.  <br>  <br>  Before we were married, she started calling me daddy, and after we had kids, it just became natural.  But she uses that term in private, as well, and I admit I do like it.  I don't think of it as creepy, but I understand people that might feel uncomfortable with it.  I asked her about it once, and she said that her father had been cold and distant and had done little physically or emotionally to provide for her.  I was everything that her father hadn't been, and so she saw me as a sort of father figure, with a couple of critical differences, of course.<br>  <br>  Hey, look folks, I have kids, including two daughters, and when they call me daddy, it's not at all the same.  I am a good, affectionate father, and I'm not confused about my relationship with my children, but if my wife of 20 years wants to see me as a father figure with a sexual element added, I'm just fine with that.<br>  <br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  Bring on the thumbs down.|`|y9CgveCGaa	No, she only calls me that when referring to me with the kids.  Otherwise it my first name or honey or something like that.|`|AA10690306	I would not like that at all.  I mean with 5 daughters it would be absolutely creepy.|`|o0Badlndaa	by my lover it has a perverse connotation ....|`|AA10565336	No I don't.<br>  <br>  I love it when my daughter calls me "Daddy".  I look at it like this; a man with a normal sperm count is capable of being a "Father", it's biological.  To deserve the title "Daddy" you need to have done more than be a sperm donor.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	she calls me daddy in front of the kids, and i think its cute<br>  <br>  if she called me daddy in bed, that would be weird|`|ikXRqWxUaa	no.  real life is not like a porno movie.  if my wife did that, i would find it creepy and disturbing.|`|ffzIqHgraa	No I don't.|`|bYfa7a4iaa	no, it's creepy.  It puts me in the mind set of dating a child.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	No|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No!|`|A2G9foewaa	no its creepy|`|WYaaPmd8aa	How about "husband".  It's called respect.|`|NckQrnxuaa	Thats just wrong on so many levels. If my husband ever wanted me to call him Daddy I would slap him upside the head|`|hLcs75ynaa	I personally don't.|`|5cbILl1caa	no<br>  <br>  it's creepy|`|POHWTDPRaa	Certainly not.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	I'm used to it because of the years and years of the children calling my wife "mom" and calling me "daddy" and us referring to each other that way...
fc4NOCp3aa	There is a middle ground here sweetie.  Women don't want a guy who agrees with them on everything or just passively says "I don't care" when asked about their opinion about things.  Also, women don't want a guy who just takes control and makes all his decisions based only on what he wants.  That's one extreme or another.<br>  <br>  The middle ground is to just be yourself, relax, and when it comes time to make decisions, go with how you truly feel.  There will be times when it's great to consider what the other person wants, needs, etc....like where to go out to eat.  There are other times when you need to stand your ground....this would be any time you feel like something goes against your core values.  You are putting way too much thought into this.  Women can sense when you're uptight, stressed, or trying to be someone you just aren't.  Just relax & be yourself.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Has so much negative happened in your relationship that you and your wife can not respect or love each other??  Man, I know that you feel like you are damned if you do and damned if you don't.  And that is a hard way to live.  It is obvious that your wife has lost respect for you.  You need to sit down and talk with her about it.  Something has happened, in her mind, that has affected how she sees you.  And you need to find out what it is and how to correct it so that you two can put your marriage back on track.|`|xWtW2kHraa	Why do you care what women say about your decisions?<br>  You sound young and immature. <br>  Make a choice for the powerful reason that you made it! That's all and forget the outcome.|`|wPAjxNG5aa	just dont say anything sometimes...<br>  <br>  us women, can be very confusing at times...   :-)|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Sweetie you need to not think so deep into it and just be yourself.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Dude, stop trying!

In marriage, your duty affects your actions. In dating, your own perferences dictate your actions (so the other person can have a clear look at them). <br>  <br>  Stop being a puss-cake. Do what you want, say what you want, and ignore accusations. If she leaves (and she's free to), she leaves. If she stays, she's going to be confident that you're not building resentment towards her and that you're happy.<br>  <br>  Find your backbone youngster!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|RvddYKqjaa	Who cares what you are called? Stand up for what you believe. ALL the time. If you are dating people who make you feel this way, you need to keep looking. Just be who you are. You can't please everyone all the time, but you can like yourself for saying what you think is true.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Stop being apologetic and questioning your every decision. If you're sure of yourself then no one can doubt you in this way.

Sp5TjXqMaa	I really don't know what to tell you here.<br>  <br>  If you weren't married, I would tell you to turn around and run from him as fast as you can. I can sympathise with the whole drug issue, considering you were dishonest with him about it, but that doesn't excuse his behavior with these women.<br>  <br>  Try talking to him calmly and rationally... and not when he's "in the middle of it". Tell him that it hurts your feelings that you are banned from speaking to some people, yet he doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with associating with females who are/were trying to hook up with him.<br>  <br>  Worse comes to worse, I would recommend marriage counseling as it normally takes a 3rd party to make him see that what he is doing is wrong.|`|WmwEYzYkaa	first off, killing yourself won't solve anything. and what is good for the gander is also good for the goose, if he wants to talk with his myspace friends you are allowed to do the same. I feel you both need to see a marriage counselor. If he loves you he'll go through it with you.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think what you should do is sit down with him and together write up a list of rules you can both agree upon regarding communication with friends.  Write out both what is allowed, and what is not allowed.  Be clear up front that the rules are going to pertain to both of you, so that he has to follow any rule he makes for you, and vice versa.  This write-the-rules method puts the whammy on double standards in a hurry - give it a try!|`|GvamTVqAaa	1. Don't do drugs<br>  2. Your husband's a jerk<br>  3. Seek counseling|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Stay away from the druggies. They will drag you down. Your husband is right. You are wrong. Get over it.
zzaScg0haa	She probably did tell your ex
AA12333135	No it means that he doesn't want to answer so kool down or he will think that you like him more than he likes you bad thing. Leave him to come to you. He is probably sick that's why he hasn't answered you so far.|`|POHWTDPRaa	No, it means his is sick and sick of you bothering him. Leave the poor guy alone.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	wow, that sounds selfish and excessive (what you're doing i mean). instead of bugging him and doubting your relationship, you should be understanding and caring for HIS health instead of your own needs. instead of going to lunch, you should TAKE him lunch and make him feel better.|`|91ACjB5eaa	yes! god! you probably annoyed him to death, get a grip|`|KasFZL7laa	you are a classic example of how us girls make guys run for the hills!  <br>  <br>  keep your cool and don't look desperate.  he's sick for christ's sake.  you are going to end up making him mad.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	He definitely will not like you if you keep stalking him.

In fact I'm surprised he even texted you a second time. His phone may be off for a couple of days,and i hate to say it but you may have scared him by looking needy/clingy by calling so many times.<br>  it sounds like he just needs some rest. give him a couple of days as the flu season is upon us. if he doesn't cntact you in the next 5 days call or text him saying " i hope you're feeling better and would love to reschedule our lunch when you're feeling better".<br>  p.s.-> don't mention anything about food until he's feeling better!|`|DybOqfGpaa	no he is sick must b takig rest dun disturb him he will call u back or text u back soon<br>  ans mine plz <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgP_MslGtuEtWxX20Xsm7Ynsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227074653AAkxMlm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No, It sounds like you are tying too hard.

Chances are he is asleep and you shouldn't bother him. Just let him call you back and find out, if he doesn't call back in a couple days your a free girl. try not to text or call to much you might wake him up and he might not like that|`|2S2onP86aa	Rule #17: <br>  Don't be clingy, text once, call once, he never replied ignore him 'til he does. <br>  <br>  Not to mention, he does like you but he is sick, remember? When guys are sick they rather do nothing, and just keep him alone for a little. Give him his space. You'll survive if you didn't talk for a day with him. <br>  <br>  Let him know you are independent, guys don't like needy girls.<br>  <br>  Good luck; hope I helped.|`|hhPKGOWPaa	maybe he's really sick..that's why he can't text or call you..but it doesn't mean he doesn't love or like you anymore..don't be paranoid just because he didn't replied to any of your text. go to his house and check if he's really sick. if he is..take good care of him. maybe he needs you more today than before..<br>  just don't panic :)|`|NleWQOqyaa	oh you poor dear, maybe he IS sick? trust him for now........but if he keeps doing it....it's either over or he's cheeting on you. but....just ask him next tim you see him...he could be standing you up? i don't know.........but just wait|`|BPqK0c5taa	Maybe hes just trying to get some rest because hes really sick and he decided to turn his phone of. Could mean he doesn't like you but don't jump to conclusions. Give it some time. And if he continues to ignore you, well you will get your answer.|`|W762b31aaa	If he told you he was sick then you should respect that.  He is probably trying to rest.  Stop texting him and calling him.  Give him time to get better.  It may not mean that you are over but if you keep bothering him, that could change.|`|gCsD5qtyaa	Either he is sick and can not answer or he is trying to give you a clue that its over.

He may be in a bit of uncertainty, which is absolutely normal depending on how long you've been together, let him get through it, you are probably experiencing that a bit yourself especially since he hasn't called you yet. DO NOT CHASE HIM, men like to do the pursuing. Take my advice and do not get mad or irritated (if you do share it with your girlfriend) Stop the obsessive calling it will only push him away. When he does call, don't ask him any questions, don't say why haven't you called, don't even say call me, don't say you love being with him, nothing, just be friendly and give the impression all is well, and that you are not angry he with him that he hasn't called you without even saying it. Then you are leaving it open for him to continue his pursuit in you. Then give him a bit more time. Involve yourself with your friends and have the confidence that you are a cool girl and he will be calling you very soon.

HzIPNEPRaa	salaam ji.great question.I try 2 answer it.<br>  <br>  Love looks for the other person's heart through a telescope.(distance doesn't matter -the souls say "no matter where you are, I'll always think about you and longing for you even though theres an absence of physical intimacy")<br>  <br>  Lust looks for the other person's flesh or body through a microscope.<br>  <br>  So,I think,the soul is the temple for LOVE wherase in LUST the body is the temple.<br>   <br>  ----The temple of soul will last ever, but the temple of body will be worshipped only until it is appealing to the eyes and carnal appetite lasts.Thats what I think.<br>  <br>  So,I think it is like a bifurcated tongue with lust on one end and love on the other,and the demarcation point is that, which temple one perceives and discerns in the other person,and thereby the path---->eternal love, or a temporary strong shot of chemistry in their hormones,I think....Its good to take the path of love and then lust,but not the lust at first coz,in my opinion,its like a one way and cannot enter the kingdom of love from there(atleast not feasible).There are thorns in the boundary of the kingdom of love and cushioned bed in the boundary of lust.Thorns in the kingdom of love???? Yes! coz after having been in love and one falls in to the lust kingdom it'll be a bliss coz of the bed.but after the lust,in most cases,if one were to fall or forced to fall in to the kingdom of love,most probably they were to be punctured by these thorns coz  by then, the heart of one soul would have shattered, and the other would be seeking another "kingdom of lust" rather than going for the love.<br>  <br>  But again,this palace of chemistry and lust is great, only when it was shielded or insulated by LOVE prior to one entering in to this palace.Then that lust will have a fulness to it.A completenes.<br>  <br>  In other words.I think,lust is like a 100 metres sprint---fast,short and sweet..but love is like a marathan---slow,long,relishing and great...and most importantly satisfactory to both the ends.<br>  its the track between these two great events that demarcates them...and in which side one lean towards at first...<br>  <br>  But ironically,I think a love with lust would be like a Biathlon,where lust is tagged as a free gift to it...            (:<br>  <br>  Love is full of--??????????????????????? + ♀♂ +??   +??  +????<br>  Lust is full of---♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂♀♂   + ????<br>   (lust alone no love)<br>  lust--piece of meats.<br>  <br>  love--peace of mates.<br>  <br>  In love,the souls can break even the hardest of gates and see through inside..<br>  <br>  But in lust,they cannot even see the heart thats been open for them to be embraced,coz simply the mind is not on that but on the perishable body or temporary beauty..<br>  <br>  <br>  Lust says "you are hot"<br>  <br>  love says "you are warm and lets cool off our souls"(true understanding)<br>  <br>  Again here it is that thin line of hot and cute or warm and smart(inner personality)<br>  <br>  the stimulating things for a lust may be purely testoterone and esterogen,,,..but in love it is both of these+understanding+attachment+expecting nothing in favor+mixing of their souls.<br>  <br>  In LUST,one person can  work alone to get it but in love two must work to make it a success...a one-sided love too,I think fails coz theirs no union of the souls.,,,,,<br>  I  would like 2 post this vdo to show the place where the love is demarcated from lust....<br>  <br>  A female dog trying to save its male partner,though they are not designed physically to easily drag anythings.the true effort of love is clear here.The dog ,to me....didn't just drag that another dog but also the very soul of it....from the yamaraj.....Just for fun,say,if it had a lust for any other dog,say somewhere around nearer, it might have jumped to another highway bridge to seek out for another partner  under a different bridge and I am afraid to tell  that video wouldn't be for kid's eyes.I think thats pure lust devoid of love.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwD769sZc9w&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwD769sZc...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  That dog even put his own life on the line of death and jeopardy..just for the LOVE's sake......It could have been run down too! But it was completely blind to this fact, and the invisible blindfold here is :LOVE..TRUE LOVE,I think.it is from the 30th second in the video.<br>  <br>  If love is like Amitabh bachchan ji,then lust is like amjad khan ji.Amitabh ji may have more moral values,but amjad ji enjoys more.Though both are different in their origin(it is this origin that demarcates them and make them to have different perceptions),both needed for a movie to succeed and the audience to be happy(the 2 souls here).But not amjad khan ji alone and the rule of the thumb is Amitabh bachchan ji must be introduced  at the start of the movie(atleast in the movie of life)  and felt by the audience before we could see the doosra.<br>  <a href="http://img.fropper.com/z/blog-images/500x400/p/patel9559-rmC-blog-2742.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.fropper.com/z/blog-images/500...</a><br>  Ga..oops! thank you for such a beautiful question...<br>  <br>  thanks folks.thank you for your replies.|`|JUG7cZkEaa	lust is the desire to have a person for yourself and feel great about it.<br>  <br>  love is the desire to see that person happy(with anything or anybody) and feel great about it.|`|Ze1iemRIaa	when you see a person if you feel happy for his/her presence as a whole its love and when you see a person and feel happy only for the reason that you can have physical intimacy..its lust|`|76ACQGyFaa	feeling of touch|`|oJV3rvsRaa	huh?<br>  <br>  if your asking what draws the line between the two...<br>  <br>  love is something that is really undescribable.

Ask her if she feels uncomfortable and what you and Patrick could do in order to make her feel more comfortable. By asking her you will show her that you care and enjoy having her there and want her to have fun but that Patrick is your boyfriend and you are just showing affection. I think if you just talk to her about it then you guys can easily figure it out and come to an agreed upon solution so that neither of you will feel awkward.|`|E8dcbmwJaa	She needs to learn how to be more comfortable with the idea of you being physical with someone.  Its probably because she wishes she could have that or  that she isn't used to it.  The fact is, hes your fiance and shes your sister, and she should expect that from two people who are in love.  She probably just needs to be exposed to the idea of displays of affection, because if she can't handle it now, she'll have a hard time with men further down the road

He is seriously the nicest guy I've ever met in my life.<br>  <br>  I don't like dating guys who are shorter than me but if I didn't have a bf already, I would totally date him. Of course, when I first met him I didn't think I would ever date him but after getting to know him, I must say that if I'm ever single again and if he asked me out, I wouldn't hesitate in saying yes. <br>  <br>  So don't feel so low! Just be a great guy all around and don't let your height hold you back. Girls will start seeing you in a different way. good luck|`|F4eVMDqHaa	My brother is 5'2 - so he should be answering this question. But since he's not here -- sure, finding a girl is going to be more of a challenge.  -- I think my brother compensated by keeping in shape, and by having a terrific personality - and women do seem to flock to him (he's my brother so I don't totally get it). Keep at it -- work at developing relationships rather then just asking random girls our. Good luck!|`|MiXnh9Cnaa	Aww, i am sure that you will find someone<br>  <br>  It just depends on the girls' preferences, some like short guys and some like tall guys.<br>  What about Jamie Cullum? He got Sophie Dahl.<br>  <br>  I don't personally mind.|`|xtd2h5JTaa	I'm 21 and maybe an inch taller. I've never had a problem getting with women. Its just keeping them that seems to elude me ;0(|`|2l5RCy9paa	Not everyone's like that. I wouldn't worry you'll find someone :)|`|FsEK3Ueeaa	why wounld someone turn someone down beciase they are no small ???|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	Its not your height mate just work on your personality and personal wealth, nothing attracts women more than a smart guy with lots of dosh.|`|r9WhvImaaa	Of course you'll find someone and not every one is so narrow minded.<br>  <br>  My bf is short and I find it quite sexy !|`|Q9sjbSkqaa	u will eventually im 6'0" and its hard to find a guy idc if hes tall or short and im 16 and ugly so i cant find a guy anyways|`|K2dv9u7baa	Yeah you can definetly find someone! I'm really short and I prefer shorter guys than tall ones :)|`|d02gJC1aaa	I love being 6'1 :-)|`|UuAV4wVNaa	i'm 5'5 and i've only dated guys shorter then me..<br>  <br>  Honestly... 5'4 isnt that short...<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd date you :]|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Well, to be honest what she did was downright rude. Of course, you'll find a girl. Any girl who says that and says height matters and stuff like that, and rejects you because of it, is just plain rude and you wouldn't want to be with them if they were like that anyway.<br>  Any truely nice girl who you'd want to be with would have a great personality, and wouldn't care about height. So don't worry about it, and a decent girl will come along in time. You're not short anyway, you're pretty normal.|`|mCQx7Co5aa	OMG, how rude of her!!<br>  <br>  of course you're gonna get girls to go out with you..<br>  i have a male friend which is your height and he's had many girlfriends who were taller than him. so dont think that short guys dont get girlfriends!<br>  <br>  its just bad lkuck that she said that but forget her and move on!<br>  <br>  be proud of who you are!|`|S0APZr5Aaa	Yh im tall but tall, short, fat, skinny it doesn't just depend on the outside to many women it depends on the inside. Ive seen loads of couples who are the same height at like 5'5" alls good for you if the girl loves you don't sweet it.<br>  <br>  Gd luck Answer mine please!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtI.AivGVmrfHrXRJUesFtTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304102306AA8rWDy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|sN8aqb95aa	At the end, all you have to do is attract them through your personality.<br>  You could take growth hormones, if you were that serious about it.|`|GuKxHsiRaa	Yeah of cause you can <br>  <br>  there's someone out there for everyone!<br>  <br>  <br>  Tom Cruise????|`|C0yagFFoaa	yeah sure oyu can mate, you need to find a girl who likes you!! look at the people on the street, see how many are with taller or smaller people|`|zp0LvPrPaa	yes corse u can and will! some girls find shorter guys sexy. atleast when you do find some1 you will know they like u for who YOU are and they arnt shallow. :) goodluck|`|v2ut95Wzaa	Yes, the girl probably just wasn't the right girl but you will find someone
vQsrGe0caa	Its a very hard thing to do but i'm 23 and I can tell you that life is not worth trying to please someone. They are not your family if they hurt everytime they get. You need to realize that you need to step away and live yourself.  Become successful and never look back.  Your mom is def right forget about them. I wish you all the luck
n01WYIl3aa	No. you dont. By them telling you they dont want to be "EXCLUSIVE" is just a polite way of saying that they just wanna fu<k. That is all they want. && if someone is not willing to BE exculsive with you, then they are not even worth your time!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|rqeEhVvXaa	In a word   NO|`|R3S1yIAjaa	Absolutely not.  Who knows what STDs you could end up with...
WnCTxGQNaa	when someone loves you they make an effort to be around you and make you happy. they do whatever they can to support you and never want to do anything to make you cry. when a person loves you, they call you just to see how your doing and they never expect anything from you. they listen to what you have to say and remember the little things about you that most don't. they tell you I love you even when their mad and find you attractive even when you look like crap.|`|GBr9YngTaa	You need to trust that they mean it when they tell you. You can't assume by actions they love you, you need to hear it from them.|`|kJX632msaa	you can never know for sure!|`|OUVUU5xRaa	They tell you.|`|AA11795191	They show it. And you feel it. You just know...and if you question it, then its probably too soon to be in love.<br>  <br>  ETA: Its easy to tell someone you love them. Love is a verb and needs to be shown.
ISDAP3gjaa	If you have a boyfriend it probably wouldn't be a good idea. But there is nothing wrong with having a ex as a friend.  But you need to be aware of his intentions!|`|qkJTx9OXaa	How did your relationship end? Did one of you cheat? Who broke up with who? These are important facts necessary to assess the situation. However, it is possible that he thinks he just wants to be friends. It might be completely subconscious for him but as soon as you two start talking and seeing each other again one of you will probably start to develop feelings for each other again. Personally, I'm almost 27 and I can't think of a single couple I have known that has remained friends after breaking up. It certainly is possible, but even if successful it will initially be a painful experience for one of you as you learn to put the past in the past for good.|`|q4b4f76Haa	I think what happened here was that he probably went and looked around elsewhere and didn't have much luck with any other girl.  And since he's single and lonely, he decided to come back to you.  so maybe he wants to get back together.|`|AA10959572	No!<br>  <br>  He's an ex for a reason.<br>  <br>  I've yet to see "exes" really be "friends".  There's always trouble.|`|SfCM96jaaa	an ex boyfriend hanging with you wants something more 99% of the time.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	it's possible but i would think he has more on his mind. most of the time the x will contact you because he wants to get back together|`|X2EPEEwbaa	no.  don't call him.  there's gotta be something else he wants from you.|`|AA12259389	guys never want to be just friends especially with a girl they dated. he either wants you back or just wants to keeps tabs on you.i,d say leave the past in the past or it will lead to trouble.|`|ay2ksWhsaa	yes its possible he just wants to be friends, if you two broke up yesterday then there might be trying to get back with you but all my friends are friends with there ex's.|`|cn49BbRiaa	No dont call him he is your ex. He obviously wants to start up things with you ok.|`|LvWgMLEGaa	no, if he broke up with you<br>  idk, if you did. :D
1xr6T6h0aa	Guys like a confident girl.  Be honest.  Tell him you dig him, ask if he wants to go hang out sometime (a bonus would be if you had a plan - do you want to check out such and such restaurant, hey, i was thinking of seeing this movie, want to come?, etc)<br>  <br>  If he likes you, he will want to hang out.  If he isn't into you, he will let you know.  If he isn't, at least you took the chance and you will know.. and you can move on to the next one... ;)|`|wigtXCBTaa	Ask him to go to lunch with you and just relax and enjoy yourself.  <br>  <br>  Clean enough?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	The best thing is communication. You can't find out anything about him or the situation unless you know the truth.|`|6wR9QkAlaa	Oof...I don't know how to describe it.<br>  Flirting is a very natural process and I reckon if you listen to your instincts about what to say next, smile brightly,, laugh sweetly, you can't go very wrong, especially if he's liking you. Think about what type of guy he is and match that symbolically. If he likes sports, he may like a girl who's not afraid to get her hands dirty. Maybe he's got an amazing sense of humour, show him you're up for a laugh and you like to do fun interesting things.<br>  And yeah, find silly excuses to go and talk to him more, but not too much. If you initiate going to speak to him and he likes what you have to say, he'll come to you.<br>  <br>  Do not work too hard for this guy, make your movements and motives subtle...always go 90% and let him fill in the other 10%<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eTBfsjCUaa	Ask him to hang out after work or you coudl always e-mail him.|`|xpu4XgPXaa	E-mail, Or Ask Him Out On A Date ?|`|Mt8x4BAjaa	Start talking to him more - when you go out to lunch, offer to bring something back for him, even if it is a cup of coffee or a bottle of Pepsi.  Maybe if your personal work is slow, and you see he's swamped with something, maybe offer to help him with some copying or something. If you have the same boss, let your boss know that you're going to help the guy out a little and make sure its ok that you do - because you don't want to get either of you in trouble.<br>  <br>  But just offer little things around the office - that are work related, and offer to pick up some coffee for him..  Just little things to start off, and to start conversation with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GFARlBTJaa	He should man up and ask you out. Its so stupid if he likes you to be a wuss about it. I personally would walk up and invite him to go to the movies to hang out  sometime.|`|AA11140814	Never date someone you work with! it always ends in disaster...or...maybe it wont end in disaster but when/if you do break up it will suck that you still have to work with him everyday.|`|UWn3QudCaa	Just say your popping to the pub on the wat home from work, does he fancy joining you?|`|5nAnWp3daa	start with small talk gl|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	ask him out now|`|IMPh53Ssaa	buy him a milkshake at mcdonalds, WHY NOT?|`|hizUz9rDaa	get his number and call him on your free time.|`|CBgmO3JDaa	ok. I dont know how old you are but its at work so i m assuming you arer out of high school. In my opinion, your next move would be to ask him to go grab lunch some time. or ask him for dinner if hes not doing anything after he gets off. Chances are hes very shy to ask you even if he thinks you are attractive. <br>     Thats how i met my girl friend is at work. I knew she liked me and i liked her but i was way too shy to ask her out. My co workers and even my boss knew we liked each other but both were making the next move. untill i finally had it. and i just told my self  that i cant believe in me then who else will and made the next move and asked her to lunch. turns out we hit it off and both of are pretty happy now. and just in case you wanted to know i m 22 yrs old|`|r7iTzPdtaa	Just be nice to him. Make a point to say hi to him and make eye contact.  Be friendly. Help him out with something at work if it wouldn't seem strange.  I wouldn't jump the gun and ask the man out.  Some men like that, but if he's traditional and prefers to ask out the girl (most guys do unless they're gutless).|`|juSJrU4waa	I agree with cubical - he should stop being shy and just ask you out.<br>  All you need to do is lead him on into KNOWING you like him. Maybe help him grow a little confidence in himself and finally he'll open up to you.<br>  good luck|`|wBzuC5pmaa	Well I think you should totally talk to him. Be really good friends first before you become more. Let him know you like him. You should make the first move. Don't be shy if you like a guy make it happen! lol|`|mGbRp96haa	I think you shoould go up to him in a short short blouse and say opps i dropped my pencil right in front of him and hell love you|`|xApAWlshaa	Just tell him.walk up to him and say i like you.we guys like girls who are striaght up|`|UDYKfkLjaa	Oh oh I know! Come to work naked. Hahaha. How cooool would that be!!!!!|`|kugPl4oiaa	talk to him
JbfKUmw0aa	I'm 18 right now and I really don't care about how much money a guy makes. My boyfriend doesn't make very much at all. I don't think that will matter to me until I'm about 22-25, when I start wanting to settle down and needing someone who isn't going to make me pull all the weight financially.
c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Maybe she was attracted to you on her terms (school, college hanging out, studying); but if she thought about an actual date, it would be on your terms (older guy stuff, opera or whatever...). Maybe you just need to show her that you are not antique. Or is it enough of an age difference that she is going to party for spring break and you are going to use the extra time to study?|`|TI65WNunaa	How much younger, wake up, mature up a little you misinterpreted her intentions if she were in to you that way you would definitely know it.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	You never really know until you ask someone out. Nobody is a mindreader you know?
b8e196946a33b64918a5f00f8f53ab72aa	It is weird, I suppose.<br>  <br>  I have found that most guys will not stay in a relationship with a girl unless they're pretty sure the girl is going to "put out."  Before I met my husband, I had to deal with that attitude a lot.  I was never the type to bring up the topic of sex, but when a guy would bring it up, I'd state that I wanted to wait until marriage.  Several guys told me that if I wasn't going to have sex with them in *insert specific amount of time* then they weren't sticking around.  My next line was typically, "Okay, don't let the door hit your rear end on the way out!"<br>  <br>  I'm old-fashioned in that I find it very crass for a woman (or a man) to bring up the topic of sex to someone they've only known for a week.  I guess you could say it's a major turn-off.<br>  <br>  Still, try not to be too harsh on the ladies you date.  I can see how you'd interpret this quirk as a sign of weakness, but the truth is, romantic relationships are very important to females.  We tend to judge our worth on whether or not we can get a boyfriend/husband and keep him.  So, since most men demand sex within a certain amount of time, most women will up and let the guy know when she'll put out.  If you just say, "Hey, I'm a spontaneous kind of guy.  Let's just see where this goes, okay?" and leave it at that, it should nip that in the bud.  Just my point of view as a female:)|`|AA12259389	who knows,immaturity i guess and because girls know thats all you guys want anyway.|`|YFvXRutJaa	its not wired, girls these days have sex without informing their mate. if a girl tell you ahead of time when she want sex than that just mean they're more comfortable that way because it makes them more intimacy.|`|kmGW34unaa	**** the **** outta her, go *** to mouth
KNqFM5rEaa	Wow, actually both of the last two guys i've with were the ones who wanted to introduce toys. i really don't think there's anything wrong with it just as ling as she doesn't get dependent on them. spice things up, but don't let her loose interest in you.|`|uVL1kJr4aa	i think its normal|`|PNCGiNhcaa	its normal everyone wants to experience new things in the bed ...its all about having fun!|`|IOmrbVWSaa	idk sry;)
l9uGrfSYaa	Whoa, I am the exact same way believe it or not!<br>  <br>  I have come to terms with myself, accepting that I'm not the most exciting person to be around.However, that will hurt my adult life as I get older. In the end, I don't think I could hold up my end of a relationship, in which will probably end rather horribly. <br>  <br>  So what I do is talk to older people, put my insight into their conversations. I also just listen to the way people talk. In the end (and after hanging out with a talkative friend for a few months) I feel like I'm getting better at this. <br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is that what you need is a build up of confidence. Just remember that you are a good person that has the right to imput into any conversation! Your friends will probably think it rather strange at first, but they will most likely enjoy the change seeing that they can connect with you just a little better than before. <br>  <br>  Don't let personal pride get in the way either. It's okay to be silly or loosey (I don't mean that in a bad way) with friends. <br>  <br>  It will take time, but build confidence in yourself and keep practicing with older adults such as relatives and family members. You'll do great, and you'll feel like you can do anything with a little conversation. <br>  <br>  hope that helps a bit.  Bya 8D|`|1jQ0EiFYaa	how old r u

He is still going out with her behind your back and has not told ex that he is going out with you and hasn't told you he is still going with her.

d5ae6eb71f3ea80a6ec89e0c5323f28aaa	HAHA...My first love story...<br>  <br>  It was on a windy cold afternoon on the 9th of November 2006 (1st year of a new start of college). I had Japanese class. He came in late and just so happens only 1 more seat left so he sat next to me. I use to very shy, so shy I was seen as a loner XD<br>  <br>  He drew a mini version of me on his sticky notes and stuck it in front of my part of the table and wrote "Kawaii" Means cute in jap. And he kept on saying how cute I was and stuff...Okay...For being surrounded by girls all my life because I went to an all girl secondary school...I never had any guy mates before. And it was my first time interacting with a guy my age.<br>  <br>  I felt so shy, nervous and liek OMGOSH I was gonna die or at least explode and all my brains will shatter across the tables and leak blood. XD That literally how it felt. But he was kind and someone I looked up to because he had what I didn't wuite have back then (Self-Confidence to speak your mind) He wasn't smart or handsome but he was kind.<br>  <br>  Conditions...Hmm...People would stare at us when we were together and stuff. Kinda strange really. But it didn't bother me at all because it felt like it was just me n him and every1 around us isnt really there (liek some heavenly dream world)<br>  <br>  It was the first time I felt I liked someone so much I would kill to be with them. <br>  <br>  I realized I loved him when I began to think about him every minute XD And each time i recal his voice or face...I felt soem sorta butterfly tender warm feeling in my belly and ppl thought I was weird cus i was blushing most of the time XDXD|`|jBjc1UACaa	I did not fall in love...love is a choice<br>  I don't like it when people say you fell in love like it is an accident...or when you say you are madly in love like some rabid dog...seriously?!?!?!|`|mUhZxm8Jaa	Can't explain, felt worried for some reason|`|dA0mJPryaa	when everyone pointed out to me that i had a crush on the guy. i was very excited|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	whenever my bf shovels snow out of my driveway, I fall in love all over again.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I fell in love within the first week... just the way he made me feel.  The day I knew I loved him more than words could say was on February 12 2008 at 7:30 am when I got the call my dad died... he held me and did not let go for a while.  From that day on he had my heart forever and he knew.|`|TMk46Pfcaa	When I fell in love with my sweetheart all I knew was that I cannot hesitate in asking her out. Today we are a happily committed couple.

29hf7pFpaa	If there is an event coming up that a couple of your friends or people from your school invite him to go along with you but dont make it seem like a date then he might be like, " Oh you thought I liked you I was just being courteous." And if he agrees to go then move forward from there but dont be to pushy and if he suggest the next "date" then just say yes!
EbUSYjLRaa	stop referring to him as 7 and instead refer to him as " the a@@hole who moved away" worked for me

TShsb3EXaa	Do you want the job or not?<br>  <br>  Be strong and be professional. Don't worry about this crap. It may help you, it might not but make sure that you do not try to use this to your advantage..<br>  <br>  If you do then your fellow workers may turn against and 'bully' you..<br>  <br>  Just remember to keep this low.. Do NOT tell your fellow workers that you are related to the boss unless you trust them with your life!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	it should be fine if you aren't close - it would just be like a regular boss and don't look into it too much. it should be completely fine; and it's not always a good idea to work with relatives because it can cause conflict and problems :) it should be fine, don't worry about it too much. just concentrate on doing good at the job|`|e9jXrqfdaa	If your not close that shouldn't be a problem, I could see it being a problem if it was say your sister being your boss and she had to ' pull you up over something' and you thinking 'how dare she speak to me like that!' and who does she think she is and so on. But since you don't have a close personal bond like that I don't see there being the same kind of pressures if you see what I mean, and just because your related doesn't mean that you should suddenly become all lovely-dovey I think it'll work out fine and in today's economic climate it would be mad to pass up a good job.
kfM7ppWpaa	First you should ask him if you did anything stupid. If he says you tried to kiss him say, "I don't think that was stupid."  That will show him that your into him.

d3WiJVk6aa	Oklahoma is -17 hours from Sydney Australia, so when it's 1am Saturday in Sydney, it's 8am Friday in Oklahoma.<br>  <br>  As far as getting him back, he's your brother so you're going to know better than anyone the best way to get under his skin.  I would go with small and annoying, like calling him twenty times a day for the next day or two, or signing him up for some email newsletters that you know he wont like.  You know, irritating sibling stuff. ;0)|`|bXMhfrJxaa	Thereten to cut off all contact with him unless he stops annoying you.|`|JizwgEiYaa	send him a package with a dead opossum in it|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	well if he turns his phone off then there is no point in calling him when he's sleeping.<br>  <br>  The entire state of Oklahoma is in the Central Time Zone which is the same time zone as Chicago and Houston.<br>  <br>  When it's 1AM in Sydney it's 8AM the day before in Oklahoma.<br>  <br>  As I write this it is 10AM Feb 27 where I am in Houston and it's 3AM Feb 28 in Sydney.<br>  <br>  as to how you can avoid him waking you---turn your ringer off or the volume on the ringer down when you go to bed.  My landline has a volume control and an on off switch for the ringer.  If yours doesn't then unplug the phone (but if you live in an old building where they used to put the phone bells in the wall that won't work.  Used to live in a place like that in college)<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  I agree that you really know  the best way to annoy him.<br>  <br>  HEY!  How about if you call him with updates from the future.  Tell him since you're 17 hours ahead of him you know what's happening before he does.  Be ridiculous and nonsensical.  Have fun with it.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	Unplug the phone before you go to sleep. Easy as that.
GZn5VNlSaa	A guy who isn't shy, who is intelligent. <br>  Secure about himself. He is open to friendships isn't afraid to say what he thinks. <br>  Don't want to confuse that w/ arrogance - that's a turn off.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Confidence is knowing he knows what he wants. He understands you. His ego's not easily crushed if you turn him down or say something that might hurt his feelings. He can take it! He forgives you for your mistakes but won't stay around when he's not wanted. You don't feel like you're in the relationship just to keep him from commiting suicide should you decide to leave. He's willing to spend money on you within reason without making you feel like you owe him back. He says what he thinks with tact. You know where he stands because he's fair but firm. You can see how well he gets along with other people and kids. You can see his confidence in how he handles his frustrations and how he deals with others. A confident man will seek your input and not just expect you to want to do what he wants to do. A confident man is willing to show his true feelings and talk about what is really bothering him. He's willing to ask for directions too. I could go on and on.|`|qtqncRa5aa	Confidence in a guy is when you think highly of yourself. Not to the point where you are conceited or you act egotistical, but where a girl doesn't have to always say something to you that makes you feel highly of yourself and to where you always think negatively of yourself. That's not attractive to girls and if you don't have confidence, then she might turn you down.|`|0k8H91Dpaa	Confidence . <br>  I know this may sound weird .<br>  <br>  But girls like a good chase to you know .<br>  If you like a girl make sure she notices you but pay her no mind .<br>  <br>  Trust me it drives us INSANE .|`|pGjD5TTxaa	Having self awareness, don't act like your desperate...know that you have options and if this girl does not like you someone else will..let her come to you|`|JbFToTMdaa	Just look at american pie... who get lay the most?.... be like him if u simply can't be yourself -.-|`|NvnddPONaa	Confidence in a guy? I don't understand why guys think we won't like them if they aren't macho all of the time. I mean, I personally want a guy who is confident in who he is. I am not going to go out with someone who doesn't since if he doesn't know who he is, how will I. Just be yourself, if your not confident in doing something. Then don't. Its ok. If the girl is really right for you, she won't care if you stumble a bit.|`|55T1TNjGaa	We like it when they are confident to protect us and them selves and sensible enough not to get into fights but we hate hate hate arrogance.and boasting. We don't want to be patronised we just like the quiet aura of confidence that he knows what he is doing.|`|gOPe3xNwaa	I think it's being a lil cocky.  If you go in to hold her hand, you are sure she isn't going to object.  Don't be timid, and unsure about stuff. We want a man who is sure of himself and won't take no for an answer.  Well, I do anyways!|`|drqf2JIAaa	The way a guy walks..like he isn't ashamed of who he is<br>  His laugh<br>  His smile<br>  The way he dresses..not like the brand but the style..when a guy KNOWS who he is and what his style is thats sexy!|`|GmF4iAFXaa	He speaks like misteriously - my friend asked him if he fancied me and he said he wanted to hear it from my mouth...<br>  I just loved that!|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	he needs to not complain about his appearnace all the time <br>  he needs to be happy and like himself or how am i sappose to like him?
wovoZ5Z0aa	You're right to be concerned.  She may not love you for being related, but a lie like this is a breach of trust, and that COULD end your relationship.  There is no way to know for sure how she will feel until she finds out.  It is better that YOU tell her, rather than have her find out some other way.  Pick a time when she's in a reasonably good mood and tell her.  If she loves you for you, she should get over it.  If she was only interested in your family network, she MAY choose to leave.  In this case, you never had a real relationship anyway.
2zKBJkM8aa	1) You shouldn't have lied<br>  <br>  2) WHEN you tell her the truth, she may be very, very, very mad.  But not because of what you lied about, but simply you felt the need to lie to her to get her attention (whether or not that may be true).  <br>  <br>  3) After you tell her the truth, she'll begin questioning everything else you may have lied about and may be cautious about trusting you from here on, and rightly so.  You will have to prove your trust to her.<br>  <br>  4) You will NEVER be happy in your relationship if you don't own up to this.  There's nothing you can do to mask this lie and feeling it is moral to cover it up.  A healthy relationship is a foundation of TRUTH.  Be open and honest.  <br>  <br>  Then again, she could laugh it off.  Depends on the girl.  <br>  <br>  <br>  After all is said and done, your relationship will grow from this and become stronger than it ever could have been.  Plus, you will feel a TREMENDOUS wait lifted off your shoulders and can stop worrying and simply enjoy the time you spend with your girlfriend.
OBCvewW2aa	It doesn't matter what his intentions are.  Your intentions should be to keep him in your back pocket, especially in this economy.|`|a09f31fab9e4e5a637346b086ea3ef92aa	He sounds lonely.<br>  In that situation I'd say he wants a relationship,and since he only met you once,and the "attraction" phase and common interests have not taken place properly, then I'd bet he wants a pure physical relationship he's after.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Men don't try to be friends with you for nothing. Don't respond to emails anymore if your not interested.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Wow, you have that much influence over this guy over one meeting?  He must really like you.|`|AA11596133	WHY are you asking US?  ASK HIM what his intentions are!|`|t81MEJ82aa	Of course it's not just friendly. If he is high up the food chain, much older than you, yeah I bet he wants to "network". Stop being naive. If you truly aren't interested then stop responding to the emails.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I agree with Lucy.
YZokRYWcaa	i say that if you don't want the can of worms opened, don't bring the can opener. you asked, she could have kept it in. but she didn't, like you wanted her to.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	If you were just starting to go out and hadn't agreed to be exclusive, then it wasn't cheating.  I think you should go to pre-marital counseling with her and work through these issues before you get married since they  are obviously bothering you.|`|AA10975867	You are both very immature, irresponsible people who admit to being promiscuous liars and cheaters. Anyone who says that they would retaliate for an affair by having an affair has the mental capacity of a prune. This is your decision but if you stay with her, do so with the full knowledge that this is a woman with no respect for hersel, no idea of commitment, no moral values, no clue about being a good role model for her daughter. You, on the other hand, have jealousies, a controlling nature and a lack of trust for anyone. I could say you deserve each other, but really no one deserves either of you.|`|AA11100500	Well she let her worms out, someone still has their canned up.... If you didn't want to know you shouldn't have asked... I'm sure she's not cheating on you know. Alot of girls have alot of bfs at the same time if there isn't really anything serious between them and one guy... <br>  <br>  Sorry about you luck.|`|JtJxVBOsaa	She hasn't cheated on you. She's gone out of her way to show that she wants to be faithful. She even told you her biggest secret, knowing it might upset you. It sounds like you trust her, but you're worried because she loved being single. Well clearly she loves you now, and she doesn't want to be single. If she did, she would have cheated on you or wouldn't want to marry you. She never would have made things official with you if she wanted to keep seeing that other guy, and he's out of her life now. Trust her and be glad that you're the one who's good enough to convince her to settle down!
NqWl2qlPaa	Why not? If you have to go, you have to go, right?  If you do and your bf doesn't like it tell him he can shove it because it is a normal bodily function and if he has a problem with you going to the bathroom maybe you shouldn't be with him.  My husband will sit in the bathroom with me while I go, you should be able to be yourself and not be uncomfortable around him.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	yeah, i dunno why people are so uptight about this. it's natural. if ANYONE says something of it, i'll sh*t in their shoes. >:O|`|cn2B9ebJaa	if i had to, yesss..reluctantly, i wud|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Considering we practically live together, it's inevitable.

XvBlEUJraa	I'm kind of going through the same thing...Ive had a bf for over 3 years and now an old friend that til this day I still have feelings for decided to confess his love for me! You really have to sit down and figure out who's worth it. In the end someone is gonna get hurt and you will fee bad, but you have to choose which one's gonna be best for you and which one you care for the most...I mean 2 months isn't much if you really think about it...Imagine 3 years! lol but you honestly have to sit down and figure out which is the one that you want.
oyQVWpCQaa	i think what you need to do is just sit down and have a chat with her so you can see how she feels and if she feels the same then ask her if she would consider giving you two another shot but if she doesn't feel the same then just say that's fine i just wanted you to know, i mean she may start to come round<br>  gd luck ;)|`|tqv28u62aa	Ask her; if you want to go out with her, you should just ask her out.

Check it out if you want to: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com/</a>|`|81RZP8myaa	right now, you're not in the position of bargaining since you were the one who broke up with him. for someone else. <br>  <br>  i do believe that he still likes you, if he wants to get back together you, but the guy is obviously scared getting his feeling hurt again. i don't want to sound mean, but you going on flirting with other guys probably wouldn't have made that situation better.<br>  <br>  this is a typical cat&mouse-dilemma. it's about who has the most power in a relationship. you've had the upper hand for a while (i guess), so now he's trying to play harder to get. he wants you to compromise (or more rather sacrifice). in that way he knows he has you for sure. <br>  <br>  you can't blame him for feeling like this. and i won't blame you for wanting your ex back. but what i'm trying to say is that you will get to see him more than 2 times a week. this is just him being careful for now, or assuring himself that you really do want to get back with him.<br>  <br>  honestly, i don't think you should be flirting with other guys, or try to make him jealous. that won't work on this point. it will only push him further away, or make him dislike you. <br>  <br>  don't worry! it's still not too late. just be honest with him. talk to him about your feelings (sounds like a cliché, but it's the right thing). assure him that you do want him, and nobody else. and tell him that if you two ever do break up again, it won't be because of you, cause you're all in in this relationship.<br>  <br>  hope that helps :)
w2RUSkSXaa	just ask. the worst can happen is he say no. Don't be shy!|`|POHWTDPRaa	You should always ask a person out face to face. Doing it over the Internet or through a note or text message is immature and a good sign that you aren't ready to date yet. Same goes for getting a friend to ask for you. If you are going to do it, you need to do it in person. Keep it simple. 'Would you like to go bowling on Saturday?' That's all it has to be.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	face to face otherwise it's a joke|`|xpgISLqRaa	Never ever get your friend to do it because that can mess the whole thing up so easily! Most of the time the guy has a harder time saying no face to face, so that's a plus to doing it that way. Doing it by note is almost just like texting, which is impersonal and if you really want to go out with him, you should be able to find the courage to do it in person! So I say ask him in person, because being rejected can be fate or if he says yes, it'll be one sweet story to tell the kids ;]. Do it girl!|`|6W6B26sgaa	Do it face to face, it looks more ballsy. ;-)<br>  <br>  If you think you have a good chance, anyway, ask him face to face...I know when I was younger I always felt like a punk when people would give me notes to "go out with them"<br>  <br>  Just be blunt!|`|SR1FN2nqaa	have one of your friends send a note from you if you dont or have the guts to ask yourself. it does work....believe me. leave your number for him to call you also, it makes it faster and easier for him to connect to you if he does want to. good luck.|`|YTasscmKaa	Nicole, I'm guessing you're pretty young, but you know the only way you should ever ask anyone out is face to face. What to say? Hey, wanna go out sometime?|`|j5MoF8ahaa	Do it face to face.<br>  <br>  A note seems a little 5th gradeish.  if he doesn't like you then go to the next person, no big deal.<br>  <br>  However, try to ask him alone, not in front of his friends. guys act different infront of their friends.|`|GUvFFBKEaa	theres always the classic do you like me <br>  [ ] yes<br>  [ ] no<br>  [ ] maybe<br>  <br>  in the note you could put, <br>  " hey, i've been hoping that maybe you and i could go out some time ;) "|`|KsjFbWQ9aa	Ask him face to face woman, when it comes to us guys we always ask you face to face.|`|PVbBRC5jaa	flirt with him and then ask him out face to face|`|CS8pOFvdaa	ok wow first girls dont ask out guys. second if u are gonna ask him out do it face to face
hkwBR1moaa	I saw the cutest one on a wedding website.  I'm sure yoiu can google it.

We just used a unity pick (interlocked rings) and had a cascade of fresh flowers surround it and then go down the side of our cake. It was gorgeous.

We both like to hunt, so its a girl and a guy in camo and orange, both holding their rifles. It may not be traditional and look anything like a wedding cake topper, but its us! And that's all that matters! It doesn't really match our wedding but oh well. Some people really don't care for it,(i've asked a previous question about what my cake should look like).. but I could care less what they say! It isn't their wedding! I like to be original and have things resemble us, since it is our day!

sLLgERQWaa	The only thing you have any say in is who gets invited.....either you or your Mom are asked for the guest list and THAT is what she needs to follow.....it is not up to her to add or delete people. Everything else is in her ball court.<br>  <br>  Can you give your MIL & her family a 'heads up?' without the aunt knowing? Do it diplomatically by telling her your aunt is being overly enthusiastic so if they receive a shower invite & choose to decline, you will be more than understanding, in fact, say your aunt's behavior is a bit embarrassing to you......you'll win 'Brownie points' with the MIL for being so considerate of her & her family  and who knows, tell them if they wish to come & not bring a gift because you've already gotten a shower gift from them, please feel free to do so after all, it's a party! Just remember that after the gifts are opened, thank the in-laws who choose to attend & not bring a gift, acknowledging that they gifted you at a prior shower.....good luck.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	I think you had an opportunity to tell your aunt that your fiance's family was hosting the shower when she volunteered.  Why all the segregation?  Double shower?  You need to communicate your wishes to your aunt in language she can understand.  Don't down her for wanting to support you and honor you.  That's just wrong.|`|at4ly96Haa	hmmm, dont let her take control!<br>  <br>  This is YOUR big day! not your aunts!!|`|d7bJIgqlaa	You need to be very nice about it.  It was nice of her to offer to throw a shower...they take time, planning, and money!  You should sit down with her - just the two or you (so she isn't bombarded) and talk with her.  Tell her that you are so excited about the shower and that you really appreciate her work.  Tell her you are a little nervous about the guest list because you feel kind of stingy asking for shower gifts from people more than once.  Ask her if you can prepare her a guest list with contact info and get that to her.  Tell her you would really like to split it up and do different people at each.  She should really understand.  At both showers you can have your parents, all the bridesmaids, and any other close relatives (sisters, aunts, grandparents) who would WANT to go to both.  That is a party in itself.  Then, have the remainder of his family at theirs and your family at your aunts.  You could do your addtional friends at one and parents friends at the other.  Be sure to communicate with whomever is throwing the shower on his end too and see what she was thinking with regards to guests.  Talk, talk, talk.  It is so hard, but you can really always do it in a nice way and people will respect that.  Remember that in the end everything will be wonderful and have fun!|`|Y28BMEu7aa	tell her to back off its your day ;)|`|AA11790576	It should be what you want not what everyone else wants.  Can you just have one shower and both work together?  You will be ONE family.|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	It sounds like your aunt is trying to do what she thinks is right for you, and doesn't understand your discomfort about your fiance's family being invited to two showers, and therefore having to produce two presents.  I think you need to kindly tell her that just that plainly.  Tell her that you appreciate what she's doing for you, but make it clear why it would be wrong to invite your fiance's family to the shower she is hosting: they are throwing a separate one and you don't want anyone to have to get two gifts for two different showers; only your family should be invited to the shower she's throwing because his family will be at another shower they are giving.  Be gentle, but direct.|`|iKYNUni0aa	just tell her how u feek
R7b150Iyaa	Don't call it a wedding, call it a 1 year anniversary party or a vow renewal ceremony.  Also, don't wear the big white dress, that's overkill.  But you can definitely bust out a gorgeous evening gown.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|sLLgERQWaa	I am NOT a fan of pretend weddings just so a already couple can dress up and do the big white wedding thing....it demeans the sacredness and importance of weddings and turns them into nothing more than fancy dress up pretend parties on the same level as birthday parties and senior proms.<br>  <br>  Wait until after the baby is born to have your big wedding...it will be the real deal and many of your guests will not think it silly to pretend to get married when you already are, and are just having the party for the sake of playing pretty princess and getting gifts.|`|F3i6UUKYaa	I wouldn't go about it that way, but close to your first anniversary, you could have a "renewal of the vows", and that way your family could involved in bearing witness to the marriage. You can also have a party afterward. However, I would definitely renew the vows in front of everyone.|`|AkUhaMm9aa	you can get married now and then have a  religious ceremony or blessing ceremony or renewal of vows a year after..<br>  <br>  or you can just get engaged and have an engagement reception now and year later have your big wedding...also with a baby on the way..you guys should saving money for both wedding and baby...so yea wait a year..or more<br>  <br>  there are many choices...|`|8fT10Lvbaa	you can have your reception after a year... <br>  <br>  i got married year and half ago and i didn't go to my in laws house yet because they are in the different country .....<br>   <br>  i am going there this july with my hubby and we'll have our reception up there.....<br>  <br>  if you think people think its greedy then don't accept any gifts or envelope... and don't forget to mention in your invitation|`|AA11220327	when you want to have the big reception, just dont call it a wedding, call it a renewal of vows. That way people will understand that you are already married, even though you eloped at the time, but everyone including you will still get to enjoy the wedding of your dreams|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I am afraid that I do think it's tacky, yes.  I don't believe in people having "do-over" weddings just because life circumstances got in the way.  Maybe you could have a vow renewal ceremony in 5-10 years on your anniversary and have the big party at that time?  (Of course, you shouldn't wear the big white dress if you have a vow renewal, because that is simply the last word in tacky.)  Another idea I had for you was to postpone your wedding date until after the baby is born, and then just have the big wedding you've always dreamed of at that time, with your sweet baby as the world's cutest flower girl/ring bearer.  Would it be terribly hard for you to push the wedding date back until next year or so?|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	tacky.  no one I have ever known has done that. have your kid, then have a wedding- if you have the money!  kids are expensive I hear.|`|w1necKzYaa	Yes it is totally tacky! why not just have your big wedding now! alot of people get married while they are pregnant!|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Why not have a vow renewal ceremony at your one year anniversary and have a wedding reception after that?|`|AA11380378	Re-do's and gift grabber fests after the fact and rude, tacky and WRONG.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HQsmRzPsaa	not really "tacky" just a little odd|`|29I8PWrxaa	People ask this question quite often on here and I always just think it's a bit tacky.  If you can't afford the big wedding now, then simply wait.  Otherwise, get married in the courthouse and have a small reception.  But if you're anything like me, you want the big sha-bang.  <br>  <br>  If you are in a hurry to get married right away because you need the benefits, then file for common-law and have the wedding ceremony and reception next year after the baby is born.  If you are religious or something and want to be married before the baby is born, then yes I think next year is too late for the reception.  But personally, if I happened to get pregnant before my fiance and my wedding next June, then we would simply put off the wedding for a year so I could look good in my dress and have the wedding we always wanted.
XOJpgFRkaa	A surprise kiss. Out of nowhere. That's the hottest thing a girl could do. You're walking, then all of a sudden, she puts her hand on your face, turns it, and gives you a nice, relaxing kiss.|`|PzboDDI2aa	mop the floor and wash dishes

qaaiZovWaa	You are perfectly normal! Do not rush into anything, it should happen naturally. If you rush into something it will feel awkward and have less importance. Have patience, don't sit around pondering it, and have some fun!|`|0rAgtGNgaa	No its not unusal at all.  Its completely normal.  there were plenty of men that I graduated highschool with back in 02 that had never been on a date with any one, or kissed any one, and so fourth so on.   I was 19 before I opted to do anything like that|`|06Z3fh4laa	Seventh graders having sex? Does anything even happen? LOL|`|msNXomjTaa	7th grade!!!!  <br>  <br>  My daughter is in 7th grade, and has not shown the slightest inclination to go out with anyone, and neither do her friends.  13 is very young for that sort of thing, although some kids rush things, mostly based on what they see online and tv, thinking that everyone is like that, and is supposed to be.  Not so.  Usually, people do that sort of thing around 16 or so, and sex is (on average) even later.<br>  <br>  Don't rush your childhood!  It is the only one you will have!  (Well, unless you go all senile when you are really old, but this is not common....)|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Not weird. You still have a lot of growing up to do. Don't rush growing up, you only get to do it once. If it makes you feel any better my best friends brother is 24 and never went out with a girl either. He isn't ugly or anything just kinda shy and awkward around girls.|`|e6f57551a9fea96616d64364edaca81faa	I was the same way at your age. I am now 29, with a lot less regrets than my friends who dates EVERYONE!|`|LykjWv6faa	Yes, it's normal. I never really went out when I was your age.|`|ftI1Hny8aa	It's completely normal to have not gone out with anyone at your age. In my experience, it's actually better to wait until you're older to get into a real relationship. Not to say that thirteen-year-olds are immature, I know a lot of thirteen year olds more mature than a lot of older teenagers and adults I know. I'm in high school and hardly any of my friends have had boyfriends or girlfriends yet, so if you're not normal I don't know what is.|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	Well, yea it's normal. You have your whole life ahead to worry about dating. focus on school, improving yourself if needed, and maybe along the way you will meet that girl that likes you and you like her, and everything will just fall into place. Take your time!! I'm a 14 year old girl, and choose not to accept a guys offer for a date simply because he wasn't the right guy, even though i've never been on a date (hmm, messed up, huh?) <br>  <br>             Well anyway, if you aren't an early dater, find something else to do until you do start dating that girl that likes you.

Enjoy your childhood and don't be in a hurry to grow up. Only start dating when you would be ready to commit to the other person and for a guy that could be past the age of 20. Right now just do good in school and concentrate on your grades, when you get to highschool really try hard to keep up your grades and get into a university after you graduate, possibly get a scholorship. enjoy the time with your family and just have fun, start a competative sport its fun and will keep you out of trouble. Good luck.|`|XTOPyj3oaa	I am really surprised about your best friend. You are definitely way too young to be doing those things with girls. I would say that not dating anyone in 7th grade is totally normal. If i were you, i would wait until high school to get into the whole relationship thing. Having a girl friend might be fun, but its hard to have a strong relationship in middle school. plus, girl drama can get pretty crazy sometimes, and trust me, you don't want to be involved with that. Just wait until the right girl comes along, and stay in your pants for god's sake, you don't need a little boy or girl before you go to high school!|`|rhsP7LoQaa	no sweetie<br>  youre still young<br>  shoot<br>  i didnt get my first kiss till i was 14 turns out  he was my first love and everything<br>  but you're still young<br>  its ookay if you havent had a bf yet<br>  im pretty sure one of you're friends will most likley get an std<br>  by the time theyre 16<br>  so its better this way; and guys respect you for it<br>  and you have some dignity and trust me knowing that you are better then the girls you hang with and that you respect yourself<br>  will help you alot<br>  that way youre not as pressured<br>  trust me<br>  you dont want to make mistakes<br>  because they will bother you for like ever|`|bhnPUzypaa	Listen, you're only 13 years old! you have plenty of time to get a girlfriend!

GIVE THEM PRIVIEST!  and no its just your calling has not been made yet|`|T2GvQxPLaa	yes, that's very normal. your friends are sluts.|`|0231d2843faa4847a6c7ee14ea2b73f5aa	Trust me.  It's more common than you think that kids your age have not dated anyone.  Your not missing out on anything.|`|GOdJYN8Haa	its normal<br>  <br>  ur friend who did it.. yeah. there sluts|`|giuzEeucaa	You're not weird, its normal. My gosh you're barely a teenager.|`|59DkkvSraa	definatly your only 13 dont feel like dating is important or anything because its not!!!! especially in jr high. if ur friends are already having sex in jr high dont be jealous because jr high girls have nothing to offer. the other person is right they are sluts and they will wish they have waited a little longer when they are older and nobody will want to date a creepy slut. making out with jr high girls is no fun either. wait till you hit highschool bro just trust me you may feel like your missin out but your not i cant stress this enough TRUST ME! if you do get a girl thats all cool and everything but 100% of the people your age that are dating already are only doing it because they want to seem more mature and feel like adults but they arent they are just being dumb stupid kids. just chill out and have fun with your friends because once you do get a real girl and not a slutty 7th grader then you will realize you wont have any time for friends or fun anymore.|`|gH1z7Mfsaa	no..its not weird...i personally would wait until ur older to date maybe 3 or 4 more years. The reason i say that is cause alot of 13 yr olds will make mistakes that they might regret later cause their bodies are changing and tons of emotions and chemicals racing thru ur body....but thats my opinion.|`|dRHqR4tcaa	Of course, everyone starts dating at a different time. Plenty of people don't date until high school, and some even wait until college. You have nothing to worry about. Your time will come.|`|SRbuYVAzaa	Yes! I 13 too add I have never gone out with anyone!<br>  <br>  Dont stress! Your friends are just trying to act more mature. Enjoy being 13 - don't let a girlfriend/boyfriend get in your way!!
pG9cufuHaa	Honestly,<br>  Being a guy myself (No I wouldn't do this to a chick, nor have I) I would have to say he is using you.. I have known a few guys to pull that crap just to get in ur pants.. and if ur smart like ya seem to be, don't.. Happened to one of my friends and after a while she was like yesterdays news and he was onto the next best thing (cuz a lot of guys are assholes, and give the rest of us a bad image.) So yes probably so thats my advice.. Hope it helps..|`|HHERTudVaa	yea i think he is using you. it happens to me with girls. move on. i would never do that.|`|k5OQQt2vaa	yeah, he`s using you. forget about him:)|`|gdAhrfOYaa	yeah pretty much.  common sense should tell you what he was lookin for.  I aint snitchin lol.
Lrf2OBPVaa	i have to agree with lilrockerbabe maybe its her way of flirting..<br>  but still maybe she just likes you as a friend but in a strange wanting way you know.. ?<br>  maybe she can't get enough of you, but all-in-all i think she likes you very much, as i always say, talk to her be alone with her and ask her how she feels about you and wether you like her or not tell her how you feel.<br>  best of luck! :D|`|N6frEVbiaa	she probably lkes you :]|`|bw9b8bzPaa	Um.

If you are texting with a stranger or someone you don't know, I wouldn't send them a pic anyway.  Texting is no way to start a relationship.

That is so wrong. Sounds to me like she still likes this other guy.|`|1aUfx70Laa	Tell her you feel uncomfortable with her talking about her ex's in front of you.

Maybe she's trying to show off or act cool by talking about them but just tell her that you don't fell comfortable with it and she should stop. Good luck ;) x
NUWdgQuraa	29yo:<br>  <br>  He doesn't want to party necessarily, but he does want his options open in case something better comes along.  He might even have his eye on someone in particular.  (If he does, he will NOT tell you about it.)<br>  <br>  Just in case it doesn't happen, he wants to keep you around in a holding pattern for a few years.<br>  <br>  My advice, cut him completely loose.  You deserve someone who wants to commit to you, and not keep you around as a spare part.
BPqK0c5taa	Nothing wrong with a strict diet. I am a guy and I'm on strict diet not to loss weight but to be healthy. Depends on how strict it is and if your like starving yourself or something. Of course I would date a girl that's trying to look better, but I guess it also depends on how she looks right now as well.|`|PJ6sujbSaa	though I'm a girl but as far as I know guys they don't care about it unless you don't make THEM so sit on a diet. :)<br>  If you don't  bother anyone with it, then it's ok|`|kMzDp2Byaa	many people like fat girls<br>  it doesn't mean a lot|`|PWN5rqgxaa	i would advise her to not worry so much about the strict diet... the way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you put in...<br>  <br>  so she should exercise daily for at least 30 min, and eat healthy every day...<br>  <br>  because if all she wants to do is lose the weight then start eating again, the weight will come right back on her|`|Rez6KpoNaa	u may be able to help her u never know try helping or counseling her some kind of way|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	what are you 15??? come back when your 18|`|CVTCGnbRaa	Sure.

cmEi3CVqaa	when you see her coming just smile and say hi, maybe give her a hug, ask her if she's ok. get conversation going, lyk if she asks you back don't just answer yes. bcoz that ends a conversation immediately, carry on to say something like, so glad it's sunny today (: or it's a shame it's raining today isn't it, i don't like the rain. any random conversation is good (: ask her what she's been doing lately, and really the trick to keeping conversation going id to elaborate on your answers as you'll find that it will lead onto another topic of conversation, be open with her and get to know her. seem interested in her and make eye contact a couple of times :) o and smile too :) everyone loves a smile :)<br>  <br>  hope it helps (:|`|xgJbxZgfaa	tell her hi and she looks pretty and talk away.............|`|QHvuD8SJaa	Just ask her about herself...her family, friends, activities.

You need help dear, because no self-respecting girl is going to tolerate that kind of verbal abuse, sorry or not after multiple encounters with your temperment...The "three strikes and you're out" guideline apparently kicked in and she's done as a girlfriend, but will remain a friend.  You achieved this all by yourself...<br>  <br>  You have to change your ways, your habits if you EVER (repeat:  EVER) expect to be in a mutually satisfying, loving relationship.  You may find another who puts up with you, but it won't last...not until you do the work it takes to change your life course.<br>  <br>  What kind of background are you from?  Is that kind of behavior acceptable in your home life with a Mom/Dad?  I would think you'd know its both classless and tasteless and you need to shed such tacky ways, if not wholly, self-destructive in relationships.<br>  <br>  Well, I've said it a lot, but I mean it:  get help for the drinking.  set a different course of life for yourself.  STOP drinking alone at home for one...exercise, get out and move, do some volunteer work so you don't feel sorry for yourself or whatever it is that's troubling you.<br>  <br>  Only you can change the compass in your life...and NOW is the time to do it.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|AA11865280	To call her degrading names is a problem along with the alcohol abuse. You need a clear mind to have a healthy relationship with her. Try to resolve the issues with her in a gentleman's fashion and don't argue but simply "discuss" the issues you and her are having. She may genuinely love you but the issue of you calling her those types of names along with your alcohol abuse are overriding her love for you.|`|Z6mKM1DOaa	People have their limits.  There is no excuse for verbal abuse, even if you are drunk.  That means you can't control your alcohol consumption and your behavior while you are drunk.  She's given you a couple of chances, and I guess the third time was the charm, as it were.  <br>  <br>  No offense, but it sounds like she has too much self-respect to put up with your abusive behavior.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you need to look into your drinking, or get counseling because it seems you may have some anger management issues.  I'm not trying to be judgmental, just honest about the situation with a true desire to help you.<br>  <br>  I've been through this before with an ex.  He drank heavily as well, and got physically abusive.  He got into counseling and quit drinking, but the damage was done.  I couldn't move beyond the fact that he hurt me they way he did.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, it's probably over with this girl.  Perhaps for now you should focus on yourself and do some serious introspection.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Change your ways.|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	stop disrespect her

be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	Unfortunately men claiming they had a vasectomy are pretty common (so i am told).  The alternative is his vasectomy failed.  My ex-girlfriend worked in a clinic and she said that almost half of the men that get vasectomies never return to get a semen analysis.<br>  <br>  Most doctors recommend getting a semen analysis done twice, then every so many years after a vasectomy.  Most men are not very well sex educated (but think they are), and therefore have no idea what a semen analysis is unless they have had one done.  I suggest she ask him when he had his last semen analysis.  If he does not know what that is, then it is a good bet that he lied about having a vasectomy.  <br>  <br>  Why lie about something like that when it is very likely to get him into big trouble?  Well, he is not the one that has to carry the baby for nine months.  Selfish huh?<br>  <br>  A lot of people will give you a blanket answer like, "Get a DNA test".  Just give them the thumbs down.  Have you any idea how much those cost?  No they are not cheap.  A semen analysis is conclusive and only costs about $15 with insurance.|`|di7N0CMkaa	Yes, I think it might be positive.<br>  If she has already talked to the wife once, maybe she can talk to her again and ask if he really had the vasectomy.<br>  <br>  I'm sure the wife would be honest.|`|I6dIkhbOaa	Yes, it's 100% possible he lied. Sounds like he has no problem lying about the big stuff. There is no way for a woman to be able to tell if a man has had one unless she sees the documentation in his medical records. Sounds like your friend got played by a real jerk. I hope she's okay & if she's not pregnant, advise her to break all ties and ditch this guy quick and complete. He only cares about himself.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	If he's the kind of cad who would lie to her about being married, he's also the kind who would lie about having a vasectomy.  Most likely she is.

3PF3lt5Qaa	I dont think this is appropriate in school huni, u cld get into lots of trouble - i work in a school iknow.  And im only looking out for you.  Apart from anything else it's meant to be enjoyable and how can u enjoy it if you're worrying about a teacher coming round the corner?<br>  <br>  You should only do what u feel comfortable with, and if you are genuinely ready for this and think he's a nice guy then he'll understand when u tell him you'd rather find a better time and place to enjoy something like that.  Otherwise i would steer well clear. <br>  <br>  And when you're ready and with the right person you'll know how to respond, you'll do what comes naturally - you can either join in or just enjoy it.  Anyway good luck :) xx|`|uC55n3HIaa	Yeah... umm, any guy who actually says that is probably a pervert. No guy tells his girlfriend (I'm assuming you're dating) that he's gonna mess around with you. And you obviously shouldn't do it at school, if other students found out, you would be labeled as a slut for the rest of your high school life. Be smart, don't let him do anything that you don't want him to or don't know what it is.

Wear a tight belt if you have to.<br>  BUT if you DO want to and want him to, then let him.<br>  If it feels good then yeh do the same to him.<br>  But if not then shove him away and RUN.<br>  <br>  Anyway at school?<br>  what a crap place.

How embarrassing would that be if you got caught?! Just for future advice you don't do anything back just enjoy it and maybe kiss him. Go ahead and let him do it if you want but just imagine how embarrassed you'd be if you got caught by a teacher and they'd phone your parents up to let them know what you've been up to. x|`|QIwhMrBraa	techincally that is sexual harrassment. did he text u that or actually say it. if he texted it, show the teacher or ur dad.<br>  <br>  if u fancy him, fine, but love this isnt really the way for blokes to chase a girl unless u already are having sex with him, and im guessin ur not.<br>  <br>  if u were my daughter i would tell u to stay away from this one, he's a player. and remember if you do let him, he may turn on you and u will be the school sl*g.<br>  <br>  do u know him well enough to know if he's got a mean streak in him? if not, then stay away, this screams out trouble|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	You should stay the heck away from him.  You are way too young to even try to go there.  Especially since you have to ask a question like this...|`|YANN4mXNaa	Not in school honey.
NHrbbZKVaa	Alright first off calm down. The best thing to do is to let him know that you want to see what he's all about. It's best to do that as soon as possible. You've liked this guy for 3 years. It's better to see if it's going anywhere right now rather than waste anymore time. Time you could be in a relationship with him. Time that you could move on and meet someone better for you. I hope that helps. Good luck.
FnfHTOnaaa	Sounds like a good guy if he is willing to wait...the past is meant to be in the past...he loves you and is willing to wait until you guys get married then i think you gotta realize that he is a good guy. Don't be jealous of those other people they are in his past and the past is dead live for the present/future and you'll be fine|`|uBssj3Znaa	It is in the past and you can't change it. Learn to accept that or move on.|`|I4BEe27Gaa	Exactly. If you cant get over it, it isnt going to work. Jealousy is probably the worst of all the emotions. <br>  <br>  But talk to him about it if you have not already. But ask yourself: Is it worth loosing him over?
qzVGaVWgaa	yes you do.  he is prob timid to be too pushy in the beginning asking you with alot of questions.  maybe you can give him the hint that you TOO are interested and contact him to just talk and go from there|`|5bqKLMg0aa	It appears to me, he enjoyed  his time with you but he didn't seem to interesting.

HCf73ZsEaa	As the husband of the crazy woman who asked this question. ( Just kidding, you know I love you )... I like when she checks on me. Anyone can say " I love you ", or " You're  my man and you're mine ", but catch your wife checking your phone to see if bigbooty girl has txt msg me and I feel really loved. Why? Because if she didn't care, she wouldn't check. Plus here's the best part, I know she thinks I am still a hotty. If she didn't think I was still good looking ( in her eyes ) than she wouldn't check. <br>  <br>  In addition, we mess with each other from time to time. I will come in from outside and pretend I have a secret txt msg she can't see, then we wrestle for the phone a little bit. Bah, whatever, it keeps the relationship interesting and fun. Here's one she gets me with, I leave the room and she text messages me with something like, " Oh glad my husband is gone, what are you doing sexy..." Then pretends she sent it to me on accident. Women. *rolls eyes* <br>  <br>  And when it comes to trust I have one philosophy that I share with driving, I trust that I am a safe driver, it's the rest of the drivers that I don't trust, so I drive watching the others... I do the same with my wife, I trust her, I don't trust the rest of the world not to try and hook up with her. Either way, a little jealousy and insecurity is fine in proportions. I have had MANY girlfriends I didn't care about and if they cheated, they cheated.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	Sorry, from a guys prospective though, My ex wife wanted a lot of space and if i tried to as you put it....'check up on her' she would think that I was clingy and needy and untrusting.  So where is the balance?  <br>  I think I have learned over the years of pain and two failed marriages is that I must put my trust in god and that people are human and will fail you.  We are basically powerless over human failure.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	You said it sister !!   Confrontation is best I have learned from experience.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	Human beings are very complex emotional creatures.  Issues in a marriage usually involves two people, sometimes more, that is further complicated by their own emotional issues, hang-ups, and personalities.<br>  <br>  Just because what you believe and what you do happens to work, for now, for your marriage, it does not mean your belief or your way will work for others' marriages.<br>  <br>  After all, you cannot deny that everyone is different.  In addition, a marriage, consisted of dynamic interactions between two different person, is even more unique in its own way.<br>  <br>  I have a friend whose wife also believes in absolute no secrecy.  So, for a period of time, whenever he comes home, she'd take out his penis and smell it to ensure he didn't not screw around when he was out.<br>  <br>  Different folk, different stroke.  There is no need to question how other wives handle their situations.  If they ask questions here, that means they feel lost for the moment in a chaotic and emotionally charged situation.  We help if we can.|`|aErUKUvVaa	disagree - not saying that u shouldnt have eachothers passwords.  but that u should be "checking up on eachother" with some sort of frequency, let alone at all, is a true sign of doubt and distrust.  look urself in the mirror next time u "check up" on ur husband and tell urself what u see.|`|AA10764933	I don't consider having your spouse's passwords "nosy".  I have all my husband's passwords and he has mine.  If he was hesitant to give me his passwords then I'd be a little worried that he was hiding something.  Those who have nothing to hide, hide nothing.|`|AA12160073	I think if you have to check up on your hubby at all, you are indicating you don't trust him.  My husband and I have have a wonderful relationship.  He would NEVER violate my private space...for instance my cell phone, my closet, my purse, etc.  I would never violate his personal space:  his cell, his wallet, his bureau, etc.  Everyone deserves some amount of privacy I don't care how close you may be.  Trust is in the heart.  I certainly am not worried about his cheating in anyway.  We have a very honest and open relationship,however; we do have boundaries.  We are a couple, but we're not joined at the hip.  Godloveya.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	All i can say is this.....I come here and read these questions and I walk away completely grateful for the man and the marriage I have.<br>  <br>  And I mean that.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	The Bible teaches that sin is transgression of the law. Sin does not start with the act of breaking the law, it starts with the thought of going against what is right, what is good, and what is true. Therefore, sin is at the root of disease. We are not perfect yet, takes process of purification to become children of GOD !<br>  <br>  What is the root cause of such a high divorce rate in the society? What is the root cause of the hatred, bitterness, and strife that exists between the male and the female?  The root cause is the sin of infidelity, unfaithfulness to our word, dishonest, false, and deceitful communication. This produces in our mate disappointment and dissatisfaction, which produces quarrelling and arguments that drive away the spirit of love. Love is the mortar that holds the union together. Where there is argument and dissatisfaction love disappears; then, there is nothing to hold the union together. So, we break apart.<br>  <br>  When we break our word and our commitment to each other, this is infidelity.<br>  <br>  Infidelity produces a lack of confidence because of false and deceitful action between the mates. Infidelity begins a process of estrangement. Infidelity begins to weaken the will to feed life to the relationship. Infidelity ultimately kills the desire between the two people who have agreed to live as one.<br>  <br>  Love in the truest sense of the word is not an emotional feeling toward our mate. Love is the force or power generated from acting on the principles of truth.<br>  <br>  Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness<br>  If we desire to save our marriages, our families and our homes, we must practice the Eight Steps of Atonement:<br>  <br>  1. Someone must point out the wrong <br>  2. Acknowledgement of wrong <br>  3. Confess the fault; first to (God), then to those offended <br>  4. Repentance; a feeling of remorse or contrition or shame for the past conduct which was wrong and sinful <br>  5. Atonement; meaning to make amends and reparations for the wrong <br>  6. Forgiveness by the offended party; to cease to feel offense and resentment against another for the harm done <br>  7. Reconciliation and restoration; meaning to become friendly and peaceable again <br>  8. Perfect union with (God) and with each other

They don't need to know that you have been talking to this person for months or had seen him to chat to for a few times. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I know it is hard, someone I know has a double life because of the same situation and this is so sad as the family are missing out on the whole person just only getting what they want to see.

It sounds like you're not happy in your situation.<br>  <br>  If you want out, wait until you're 18. Your parents CANNOT make you do ANYTHING when you are that age due to the law so you'll have the cops on your side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Could you answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304013720AA6zfNG&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|t81MEJ82aa	Many guys don't have respect for females, Indian and muslim men included (most American women would classify Indians and muslims this way) but at least for someone, who is not a slave to your culture, would have the right to move on if they choose and find a man who isn't that way if they live in the US.<br>  <br>  You have a choice to make either choose your freedom and deal with the consequences of possibly losing your family or go along with tradition and hope you can find a suitable husband. I know plenty of girls in your position who date and have sex secretly on the side until they are forced to marry. With me being black, believe me, I know that I'm the last person Indian parents want their daughters to bring home, but it sure is fun messing with them on the side. So perhaps you can have your fun until then. I imagine that your parents will want you to attend college so you have opportunity.|`|UAh16Trtaa	Well its not like men have much options either, your parents just want what is best for you, I would rather marry someone in my own culture and religion, lucky for me Pakistani women tend to be much more attractive than the men, so I always have more options.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	What do you mean that rule is for white kids. It's not a rule, it's called the LAW! Your parents have no control over you when you become a legal adult. At that point it is your CHOICE how you want to handle things.|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	White kids?? No, its for anyone independant and responsible enough to be on their own and make their own choices. Not all guys are jerks, thats like saying all muslims are alike and obviously they aren't. If you feel so strongly about marrying who you want instead of who your parents want, you need to make a choice of pleasing yourself or pleasing your parents. They'll get over it, it might take a while but not as long as living a lifetime with someone you dont even love or want.|`|oAv7Mv3raa	First of all guys do want sex and the way it seems so do girls. it's not always what guys want just like it's not always what girls want. As for being slaved to your religion, I feel sorry for you. Love has no color or race. It also does not know gender. You can fall in love with a white girl! Imagine that, you and a white girl falling in love. If you are in America then live under the rules of your parents house. When you move out find someone that you love and enjoy their company. No matter if its a white guy, black girl or Anything else this world can offer you. Imagine if there was no religion. There should be a song like that.....
R7FtrsMQaa	I think that everyone who has siblings go through this it is normal but if it continues that is not good there will come a day that you guys will need each other and the seriousness will have to set in,if you have already tried to talk to him and it did not work maybe you should try looking over all the childish things he does and eventually he may get the picture , fighting fire with fire does not work trust me , sometimes people act this way out of wanting attention but he is a bit old for that , I would let him know that a joke is a joke but there needs to be an end at some point, and if he continues at that point let him know in a quiet way that he is not bothering you,once he sees that he is know longer getting to you he may just stop.Let him know you love him and the relationship you guys have when your getting along but you cant tolerate the rest anymore,and then you decide to be the mature one and leave it at that sometimes silence really is golden. good luck|`|4FeJ6B5Faa	Kay, you both need to first take some responsibility for your roles in the relationship.  Blaming each other is not going to work, as a matter of fact it will cause you two to go more in opposite directions.  Each one of you are trying to right in your positions and the breakdown starts from there.  You both need to be mature and treat each other like you would like to be treated and go from there.

AA11119739	Hmm lets see you say that you two weren't really all that serious when the earlier offenses occurred that doesn't make them any better but still you have to give him a little lead way because by your own admission you two were not really all that serious but since your relationship has grown and progressed (assuming it has) he needs to not seek out inappropriate relationships with women online notice i said inappropriate if he has a female friend who is really just a friend online you may need to be more understanding of that but sending nude photos and such is a no no have a talk with him and explain to him what you think is okay and won't you believe is wrong for him to do have to talk about it not an argument a talk and resolve this issue so you two can be happier 2gether|`|VLRZT9Foaa	He was your boyfriend and saying that he didn't have a girlfriend.

As far as I've heard, all the women want that.  The girls who play hard to get are just that, HARD TO GET!  Guys know that it's going to probably hurt their ego if they try going after those girls.  Those girls are going to seem stuck up too, if they reject them.  So, the difference is that it's the guy that has to make the first move, usually.  Why would he want the girl to make it so tough on him then?  Personally, I always went after the ones who WERE tough to get, because then you know she doesn't sleep around.  The one I got wanted me too, so she didn't make it tough on me at all.  Just for the other guys.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Because when a girl plays hard to get then it usually means the guy has to spend money to get her, but when the guy plays hard to get then all the girl has to do is offer sex.|`|Bm4cPW8naa	Some guys love it because it makes them a challenge... but some guys hate it because they think you are acting like a tease or just tagging them along... like you will put the action out there (flirting) but may never follow through|`|7LOpJW3zaa	I don't, annoys me to be honest.<br>  If a guy plays hard to get I'll just drop it and move on lol I'm not gonna waste my time :p

That doesn't take well.<br>  <br>  When you take a dress to be cleaned at a bridal shop, most of the time they take the crinoline out and use a commercial washing machine.  <br>  <br>  A satin dress is one of the easiest to dye.

She is saying that you're more than just some interchangable man that she uses as a security blanket (as some insecure women do). She's saying she chooses you because you make her life so much better, not because you make her able to carry on.|`|m2eHPeciaa	yes its true, and REAL. she's letting u know she aint gonna use u, but wanting u for what u are, not what u have. i agree, its a compliment. some women are needy and NEED a man to make themselves feel good. this girl can take care of herself.|`|b58uhcneaa	This might sound ridiculous but think of this.

enzt6grhaa	Are you posotive this guy might be gay? because he might be a little freaked out if he isn't. if he is depresesd and says he hates you i believe that could be because he's in denial for being gay and he doesnt want  to develop any feelings for you becuase if he did that means he knows hes gay. just talk to him about it but don't annoy him about anything.<br>  good luck!!|`|lDuImhg2aa	Well u sound very mature and lovely. I think if you have a gut feeling he does, he probably does, but it will make him angry because gay people get teased - he isnt comfortable with his sexuality to admit it...the best thing to do is to say u still want to be friends and to convince him how great a guy u are, then eventually he will tell u.......the truth!!!!!!!!!  Right now though u need to concentrate on getting back on good terms with him and the only way is to be the friend for now.  Good luck.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Okay, first of all you're thinking too much of yourself!<br>  Maybe the guy wants to be straight but your confusing him and scaring him because you're telling him this! If he says he hates you, it might not be denial or uncourageous - it might be the fact he doesn't want you around confusing him about his sexuality!<br>  <br>  If he doesn't want you around, it probably means that he doesn't want you there. Maybe he wants to be straight, you've let you're feelings out for him, now you have to wait for him to respond to your proposition and until then leave him alone!<br>  <br>  If he is in denial, he needs his own space to think it out, otherwise your just breathing down his neck and that will get him even more confused. If he doesn't like you, then it was never meant to be. I can't believe you didn't think maybe he just isn't gay!|`|K3a2fcq8aa	awww. well i think he just isnt so sure yet..so he doesnt know how to react..maybe he's bicurious..well just talk to him try to cheer him up and ask him how he feels about you and how he thiinks about u.im sure everything will  be fine! and if things dont go well then he doesnt deserve you! well any other questions you can email me(:

j5SlUHheaa	Just get married and get the legal thing over and done with, then have the party when you can afford it. A wedding doesn′t have to be expensive, it′s not how much you spend that matters, it′s the commitment to the person you love. It can be just as romantic with a little party with close friends and family and a cheap buffet, with the guests taking photos and driving you around. That′s the way I did it. If you want something smarter, do it Spanish style and ask the guests for money instead of presents. I think today′s weddings are way over the top.

They settle because, we humans, are desperately afraid to be alone, we are insecure, we have never learned to love ourselves, by ourselves, and some people have never learned what loving someone else truly means.  <br>  Another reason is....humans beings can not love unconditionally.  And human beings have a hard time truly forgiving another person who has wronged us.  It is so sad.  Never settle, always forgive with a loving heart, and love unconditionally.  That is why the wedding vows say..."for better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health for as long as you BOTH shall live".  People just throw their hands up and tell themselves, "if it doesn't work out, I can always get a divorce."  So, why should anyone work at his/her marriage?  It is tooooo sad.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	Because people are different and people struggle for energy; at first they get energy from the other person but after awhile they start to abuse and/or neglect the situation, and it gets ugly.<br>  <br>  Read "The Celestine Prophesy"|`|USooqQlWaa	Based on your grammar and this question I'd say that it's because of your edumucation.|`|jBjc1UACaa	because they are not centered around God|`|LLeQyWGcaa	it depends. i think most teenage relationships don't work because they are too young and not committed. marriage takes 2 wanting to be together and will do what ever it takes to keep each other happy. too many people give up and think they can do better and don't even bother to try to make things work or to try to fix their problems|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Well if you're talking about dating relationships, 99% of them don't work out because you're only going to marry one of them.

Good Luck.|`|PILm2U4Taa	The majority of relationships aren't supposed to work out.

277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	No it 2 is dead on. Definitely don't give her a pack of gum as a present. Buy the pack of gum, have it in your pocket, walk up to her and start a conversation, it could be anything. But don't come off like you're trying hard to show her that you're interested, just be a cool talkative guy. Then like 2 minutes into the conversation take out the gum, pop one in your mouth and then ask her if she wants one, if she lights up and comments that its her favorite gum then you're in and you can indicate that you're interested by asking her about herself or asking her out or something like that.|`|AA11108018	No she just might think you are the cheap skate.  What you should do is buy the same gum that she does and when she appears not to have any or use as a opener offer her some and there the door is open

qg11igznaa	She might have thought you were cute, or she might have just been staring. I did that a lot in high school when I was bored in class. You start looking at someone (sometimes a guy I liked, or sometimes just any old person) and forgot how long I had been staring until he or she made awkward eye contact with me. <br>  <br>  In this situation however, I would guess that she thinks you're cute. She turned away so quickly because she was embarrassed that you caught her, and she shrugged to try and shrug off her embarrassment. I don't know how hold you are, but if you're in your lower teens I doubt she'll have the courage to talk to you after this. It's not you're fault or anything. You just caught her staring. She'll probably be too shy and self-conscience to make a move now if she does find you attractive.|`|S6h1qsQ4aa	phraps she likes the look of you and wants to get to know you better|`|96Frq9uUaa	id say, either she thought you were goodlooking, or the person next to her was talking about you, so she looked over|`|k9uspUrTaa	She could be interested?

jdah4ZA2aa	I don't think it physically hurts guys the first time, but it may make them feel a bit uncomfortable mentally knowing that they are hurting you.  Of course, if the female isn't very aroused and "dry," the friction may burn his skin.  <br>  <br>  How long it takes to feel "really good" varies from girl to girl and depends on many things: a) how comfortable she is with sex b) if she knows her own body and what makes it feel good c) how she feels about her partner d) her partner's endowment and technique  <br>  <br>  Usually, most woman bounce around from sex feeling kind of uncomfortable to feeling out-of-this world amazing even when they are very experienced because our hormone levels, mindset, stress level, etc etc factor into our sexual experiences much more then men's do.<br>  <br>  Remember, the emotional connection plays a big part in enjoying sex, so choose your partners wisely.  And use protection, because an unplanned pregnancy or std can make it a more trouble that its worth.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	I'm a guy and it hurt on my first time, but then I learnt to use lots of lube and ask whoever it was to go slow at first.|`|BHAUXSI3aa	i dont believe it hurts for a guy unless u hurt his pen!s<br>  <br>  uhm... i think it will start to feel good when u both get an orgasm<br>  <br>  i sound grosss a little haha|`|wpiWiWFiaa	Yes it can hurt for a guy the first time.

277efdce8c0ee4a061432d1c6596e76daa	First of all, you're not going to get anywhere by flirting with a girl who isn't first attracted to you. If you try to make cheeky comments, she'll think you're a pig. If you compliment her, she'll think you're a "nice guy" and test to see if she can walk all over you. So the first thing you need is to make sure she's attracted to you. I can give you some specific tips on what to do to make a woman attracted to you, and how to tell when she's into you.

E9TnPD9Jaa	it's not a huge difference...i know a girl that is 15 and is dating a guy who is 22..ok for them it is a big age difference but don't let that get in the way(for your situation it's alright)...but if he has a girlfriend then you can't be sure if he does like you and you can't definitely wait him forever...you have to move on with your life at some point...because he is in a relationship and if he doesn't end it he is probably having a good time while you're stuck all by yourself...just think how worthy he is...good luck I hope thinks will go your way!!!! :-)|`|wZb7zilKaa	He has some "life" experiences that you don't have.  If he was really measurable with his current girlfriend then he would leave her.  Don't get caught up in his trap.  Leave him alone and find someone your age and who is single.
xliYPI7Vaa	if uve been on and off for two years thats prob not a good sign. i would say wait cuz a lot of my friends had sex with a guy who thy thought they were really in love with and could trust but after they had sex most of my friends boyfirends would dump them and move on to another girl while others said things got akward between them and very few said it was worht it so i would be careful and just not do it|`|HHyny0JSaa	If you are doubting, then it is too early.

If you are young then its probably best to wait untill you are emotionaly prepared for sex, because it comes with a lot of stuff like, STDS, pregnancy.  Having sex has usualy got nothing to do with relationships - because each partner might have their own agenda - liking each other but not enjoying the sex with each other. I would recommend waiting till you feel emotionaly prepared for sex, and perhaps educate yourself to what sex is by watching some porn. Men like porn, but i have to warn you that just because some deviant is pushing double penetration on a porn film - doesnt mean you have to do it. Peer pressure often pushes people into sex at a young age, dont feel like you have to get pushed into it. Enjoy it, but be careful.|`|oJV3rvsRaa	well if you feel ready to have sex, and your body feels ready, and you are truly truly in love with him, then id go for it. make sure this guy is REALLY in love with you and ready also, rushing sex no matter how long youve been dating can be a disaster.<br>  <br>  use protection<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304110606AAmF4Y3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ME5oMRJdaa	wait until you're married|`|0RJK65zcaa	I think you should wait until marraige....|`|CPBstHUiaa	that depends on how old you are if ur like 15 then no but if ur like 17 or 18 go for it

421288574b7a52a5ba8268e608253dfbaa	That's fine and dandy that you want to wait till you get married before you have sex. I applaud you for that. I respect women and always have. But if a woman is going to throw herself at me and is willing to do it, then I'd be a fool to not accept. That's just how I roll.|`|GZ05XsUMaa	Most boys think with their beans and hot dog.

There is still quite a lot of us guys who do respect women though, so don't lose trust in ALL men|`|6Tj70Xv5aa	Not ALL guys don't respect girls. But it's been said before, some guys are just looking for sex, and some girls are too. As far as i'm concerned the first rule for any relationship is respect.

After she replies, simply say, "Really! I never thought of it that way..." That should get her talking. <br>  <br>  The next part you are going to need real acting skills for. You are going to have to act interested. The acting skills are not as important as working in a few of these words now and then...  like "interesting," "really," "why I never," and "oh my God!"<br>  <br>  Always leave by telling the girl how absoluting fascinating or interesting she is and how you look forward to your next discussion with her.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	a true test of your acting skills...

It's really unfair to them if you have a boy living in your room, using their facilities (you'll share a bathroom and maybe a hall kitchen and such).

Don't try to fit in, you're just making it harder on yourself. Just be yourself, and if you're not comfortable with the people you're hanging out with, just hang out with the one or two very good friends. It's always better to have one or two real friends than a group of fake friends.

But I'm going to tell you a secret and although you might think it sounds crazy, it WORKS.  <br>  <br>  Practice.  <br>  <br>  Yup, practice.  Practice talking and walking in the mirror.  Pretend that he is there, try hard to get yourself feeling the way you feel when he is around and practice small talk.  Practice saying his name -- people LOVE to hear their name!  Practice asking him about himself -- people LOVE to talk about themselves!  <br>  <br>  Just keep trying.  The worst thing you can do is NOTHING.  Don't let opportunities pass.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|fTiXy11caa	well I felt like this when I was about your age,<br>  but I also thought the way Kari did and so I just<br>  made myself DO it anyway, I felt my husband deserved that.<br>  However....in the long run, it made me dislike sex even more.<br>  10 years down the road and now sex is nothing but a chore, <br>  I feel like a prostitute,  having sex just to get by,<br>  that is not the answer either....<br>  Try reading the 5 Love Languages and you will discover your<br>  love language.  If your husband learns how to express love in your language, your sex drive should return.<br>  good luck to you!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	1. Talk to your doc if you are on the pill.

Set up a "sex date"...as in the kids are in bed and let's hit it...don't wait until he makes a move and don't wait until the end of the night when you are totally wiped out.

You are probably tired by the end of the day and have no interest in sex whatsoever.  Get a babysitter for the evening and go out with your husband.

There are a lot of things that you can do; you need to just relieve a little stress from your life and connect with your husband in a different way.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Follow-Up:  <br>  People need to learn how to read.

She has taught me to start really, really slow.  I call it before - fore play.  Or pre-fore-play.  It is non-sexual touching that gradually becomes a little sexual and by then she is good with that and after a half hour or so she wants me also.  And then we go from there. :) :).  <br>  <br>  So my wife ALWAYS lets me get her in the mood.  And I am gentle enough not to "rush her".  So we both end up happy.  Also, she has stayed fit which is nice because she "feels" sexy to herself and looks sexy to me.  And exercising does help with your sex drive.  <br>  <br>  Let me give you a few gentle observations/suggestions based on my 20 years of experience with this stuff:<br>  1. He will likely always have a higher drive than you.  This can be a beautiful thing or a curse depending on how well you both handle it.  <br>  2. A deferal is VERY different than a rejection.  Saying, I am really tired is there any way we could make love tomorrow night is a deferral.  That is completely different than:  I am very tired, I don't want to make love tonight.  <br>  3. TELL him what feels good and what feels bad or annoying.  My wife doesn't like to be touched in certain areas/certain ways until she is very aroused.  Being touched BEFORE she is aroused feels bad for her.  She told me this early on thank goodness.  <br>  4. I don't press my wife for sex on the nights that I can tell she is really tired, sad, etc.  I am extra loving and nice to her on those nights.  I don't make her feel guitly for not wanting to.  It really is ok to be tired now and then.  But women who find their "day to day" life so tiring that they are "to tired" most nights either need to change their priorities or get their husbands to help out more at home.  <br>  5. My wife was a SAHM for 19 years.  She always made me a sexual priority.  If she had done the:  Kids, Friends, Extended Family, House, Other, and then if time/energy left to do so, Sex with husband, our marriage would have either been unhappy or unfaithful or short<br>  6. My wife NEVER says "no" if I ask for sex.  At worst she says, "can we wait until tomorrow?"  <br>  7. Some people talk about not having sex for months.  That happened to us one time in 20 years.  She had a medical condition for 2 months last year.  She routinely offered to "please" me in a different way but I rarely took her up on that because I don't like to feel selfish and honestly at 46 my drive is lower than it was when I was younger.  We average 2 times a week, used to average 5-6 times a week in our twenties/thirties.  <br>  8. If my wife said "I am not in the mood" every time she was not in the mood, I would truly have concluded that she simply was not attracted to me, didn't love me enough to make me a sexual priority, etc.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Just make yourself do it.  Yes, your tired with two young kids but your husband has needs.  You need to just make yourself do it and once your into it you'll reach your big "O" too.

Check it out if you want to: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com/</a>|`|NQIwNjWBaa	Leave her alone and get a new girlfriend, if she doesn't like him then why is he her bf? Women like to twist things around to make themselves look innocent but in actuality she's sleeping with him and she likes him but she is confused because she loves you...So she is trying to decide if she should stick with who she like and hope he doesn't hurt her or should she go back to who she love and hope you don't hurt her again....More than likely she will start getting mad at you all the time and then not talk to you for days or weeks while she runs of to screw the other guy and she will keep lying to you about it. and when you find out about it she will twist it and make it look like its your fault because you shouldn't have hurt her. But Don't feel bad we all fall for the he just a friend or the i don't like him B.S. sooner or later. So just move on and get a new woman.

Thinking you were raped shook him up somehow so you need to talk to him about that so he can tell you what he's afraid of. When you're both really ready it will be worth the wait.|`|08f2d348a8164ee058f53a199406118baa	Don't talk about s*x stuff with him and only go around with him and enjoy it. If he want to have he will tell you. I think when he acts indifferently about you, you will get nervous. So you should not show yourself that you are so much into it!|`|1aUfx70Laa	Blatantly obvious he doesn't want to have sex with you because of the rape situation. He doesn't want to feel guilty when making love to you because he would feel as if he is taking advantage of you. Stop pressurizing him, if he doesn't want to do it leave it at that and wait until the right guy comes along and have that special moment with him yeh? x|`|eMCCQD8Faa	I think he kinda was freaked out about the rape thing................and he said it himself ..He doesn't want to be a jerk, and maybe he feels like if he rushes into things hand it doesn't work that it would make him a jerk|`|lpyIKYUXaa	i think it's because he is older than you, and he feels he shouldn't take your virginity as you aren't in a relationship.<br>  you sound really pushy and desperate with him, so just chill it ;D<br>  everything you guys talk about doesn't have to be about sex! :P<br>  xxx
GSe6owcPaa	because once he swipes that V-card.. out comes the crazy and clingy monster|`|ruczpWrGaa	Well honestly it a LOT of pressure your putting on him.  Your first time is supposed to be special and with someone you care about.  He seems to be sensitive to the fact that your first time wasn't.  Its a major gift you are offering.  He probably doesn't want to bring any more pain to your life than you already had.  That, or he just doesn't want you getting clingy because of the distance.|`|287ryVgFaa	^---- Amen Steezy!|`|KIoACPJcaa	older guys are more mature, and he is older. also he probably likes you enough for your first time to be special and if he is what you want for your first time then he probably wants to make it special for you. plus jsut because your raped doesn't make you less of a virgin. you didn't want that and you were violated. so in his eyes your still a virgin and he wants to make sure your comfortable and okay with having intercourse with him. his older and mature he's trying to be gentle man. that makes him more interested than he seems.
D2M8DvcLaa	Ouch!<br>  <br>  Never go around anyone that is not nice to you, has or wants to hurt you or is disrespectful to you. You will end up DEAD!<br>  <br>  Move on and upgrade. I say never even talk to that first person again. Instead, file a restraining order, tell your family, friends, school officials and anyone that will listen to you. And do not forget to notify the local police department incase someone else winds up dead, they will know where to start looking. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
RUWy5Z6Daa	If he really liked you like he said he did, he would NOT flirt with other girls in front of you and hurt you like that, especially when he knows exactly what he's doing, most likely. It seems that he takes pleasure in watching you squirm and making you jealous. NOT COOL. You deserve better. In highschool...alot of the guys are just horny little bastards and I understand your frusterations with all of them acting like tards thinking of some wicked hot new girl coming. Their are some guys your age who have matured past that, no many, but their are some. Find one. Dont waste your time with the player types...you'll only get hurt in the end! Good luck! You seem like a real sweet heart...find someone who appreciates that and doesnt take advantage of it and genuinely cares about you!|`|BJQCt30Maa	get on your knees and let him know you want him giving him..............|`|5e8eded290e38b80329a8ef88d005cbbaa	You should not beat yourself  up all because you know this guy is flirting with other girls. So what let him flirt. Its not like you two are dating. Truthfully, I dont think you should be liking this guy if he is the reason you have low self esteem.If he is a flirt then he is a flirt. There aint nothing you can do about that. Thats just the way he is and if you really liked him that much then you would except him for who he is. How do you know he likes you? Are you sure he likes you? Just asking because if you notice how 'crunk' he gets when he hears about this new girl then why would he like you. You are making it seem as though he would try to get with her rather than you when she comes. If this is the case then WOW you really need to find someone else to be liking. I'm going to give you some advice now and tell you to find someone else. Feeling jealous, depressed, and annoyed is not worth it in this kind of situation. Not at all.|`|F4eVMDqHaa	He doesn't flirt with other girls just becuase he's not allowed to date. He flirts with other girls because he's a flirt - and likes the attention. Sure, he probably does like you. He also probably likes Angela and Maria and Emma and and and. Its hard to have a crush on someone unobtainable. Look around for someone else.|`|TqOsXq8Oaa	I think that you should wait and see what happends why would he flirt with other girls I would not go out with him but you are not even going out w/ him and you are all ready getting jealous you need to be a secure person|`|ZCDThZ4paa	get over it yall kant date fine someone else|`|rXMLELjnaa	if he cant date then there is no reason to try to pursue him. and if he flurts with other girls then why do you want to give him a time of day, I know its hard I have been there many times. you just have to pick your self up and meet someone else. and you are in high school, so many things are going to change and high school is not the most important part of your life! so dont dwell on things, just get over it and chill with your friends! and if you meet a new guy on they way then good, but if not, dont worry about that loser you are stressin over!|`|Rsi785nsaa	The best advice i can give is to feel good about yourself no matter what this guy thinks of you. A huge turn off for guys is having a low self esteem. So pretend like that stuff doesn't bother you and flirt with guys in front of him and you will see the tables turn very quickly!
A6XCcKIuaa	Oh my gawd the exact same thing is happening me.. Cause of the credit crunch or whatever everyone is assuming my family are soo rich and everything just cause it hasnt affected my parents job and we got a new car && were going on holidays like 3 times this year..<br>  Just ask her to stop && that it makes you feel embarassed..|`|fpHblEtAaa	well yes what the other person said about expressing your feelings and telling how you feel. I'm thinking your friend can be a little jealous of having the money and all and also should comfort her if you want. Try making your friend happy so that she would forget about it. But it's all up to you. My advice sucks I hope this helps anyway! ;)|`|MYPMoVg4aa	Well first of all be thankful your wealthy<br>  and that your not stuck without food and shelter and<br>  you can have nice designer clothes.<br>  Aslong as people see your grateful they will respect that<br>  if you boast and brag people will see you as stuck up,<br>  no'one likes people looking down on them so just ease up when they ask you questions, answer the ones that aren't so personal and be like<br>  haha yeah i appreciate all alot though and stuff like that,<br>  so they see your down to earth and decent even if you are of a higher class. :)|`|2kjJeae8aa	To me its a bit weird that she has asked, maybe she wants to know for someone else ? This could make for a scary situation think about it  Really it shouldn't matter to her since she's your friend, what your families income is  and knowing most people of the same income hang around together. I mean its rare to see well to do people around poor people. I'd ask her why she said this to you|`|BHAUXSI3aa	i got that too when i was younger.<br>  <br>  <br>  tell her to stop str8 up<br>  <br>  tell her ur not ashamed of it,.<br>  <br>  <br>  she is obviously jeleous<br>  <br>  if it gets too bad then u mite wanna say u no whut sam, im sorry im rich, im sorry ur not. stop being so damn jeloues|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Just tell your friend that it makes you feel uncomfortable and ask her not to do it anymore. The best thing is to be honest with h er about your feelings. Good Luck chicky!
NTC6g8hYaa	Ok so here is how it goes:<br>  A) he may be flirting but you never know what he will mean (this guy i like always sends me mixed signals and he has a gf) and you may be reading too much into it too.<br>  B) your 13, hes 16. His idea of a relationship will be completely different from yours. Also, your in middle school hes in high school (rite?) so things would be different until yall go up a grade.<br>  C) if you've never had a bf then this might not be the right way to start out. But thats just my opinion.<br>  D) how will your parents feel about this? Would they let yall go out often, that kinda stuff. ( my twin is 15 and her bf is 17, their dates are VERY limited) but it depends.<br>  E) does he have feelings or is he a player? You never know he might have feelings for this other girl in his grade.<br>  On the contrast: he may like you! And if he does and yall go out take it slow. But for now, keep it freinds until HE makes a move. Just drop subtle hints that you may like him!<br>  Good luck sweety!
aYL3hzgvaa	No, if anything I'd respect him, for not jumping at any chance to have sex, because it should be with someone you love.|`|NOhaRLNFaa	That's awesome. I wouldn't dump him. That's actually a lot better, because he's that much less likely to have STD's. And then if she has 'experience', then she can teach him... fun fun. Or they could learn together if she has her V-card as you call it. Or they don't even have to do anything of the sort. My boyfriend and I, both 18, are still virgins, so....<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  *smile4me* :)|`|cfnuDybfaa	thats good. please continue to practice abstinence and wait to you get married.|`|0998cb727a21ddeb5105fa6704b79faaaa	I would stay with him because i actually think thats romantic... especially if the girl is me (I am a virgin) and my boyfriend was a virgin too... I would feel less pressure to do it because i would feel as though he waited 19 years he can atleast wait until im ready!!!<br>  <br>  Looks have very little influence on who i would have sex with... You have to be nice with a good personality and willing to wait until i am ready!|`|jXgHvFimaa	I wouldn't dump him at all. Id actually be quite happy really. :D No STDs, no sex obsession, were then his first time. If your a virgin, don't worry. Girls would probably be more happy x|`|ban4WJtMaa	nope so what if he doesnt have his v card i would totally date em anyways i mean they never said you couldnt teach a new dog new tricks...XD.|`|UtR6D3UZaa	i would not dump you i would like someone for who they are not what they do.
zzaScg0haa	You gave no way to tell if he likes you, and honestly your probably young enough that dating him won't even matter
dThUilCaaa	try to get birth control and also use a condom its the safest and smartest way. BUt if you feel like you have to have sex and can't wait for the birth control, use a condom and make sure your boyfriend tells you if it rips, TRUST ME he will feel the difference if it rips. Or maybe even have him wear two. I've never tried it myself. but better safe then sorry. Talk to your mom about it you have so far.|`|aEdkaXmtaa	dont have sex on your period...nasty. Just wear a condom|`|gYuJUyvvaa	You could just not have sex<br>  <br>  <br>  Could you answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304013720AA6zfNG&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|lyMMjVNgaa	eww well 1st off dont have sex when you have your period that's just gross!<br>  Ask your mom and tell her your going to have sex by this week and trust me if she cares she will make a doctors appt fast! lol and if that doesn't help have someone else go with you like a cousin or aunt, don't ever have sex with begin on the pill trust me my friend did and two weeks later she found out she was having twins! <br>  good luck!|`|AA10313787	CONDOMS are pretty reliable but I think it really wouldnt hurt you to wait awhile.  Its something you cant go back from.  you have your whole life so really think about it before you take that step ok?|`|09EWvJs0aa	Ask ur mom again. birth control is the safest way if taken regularly. condoms will work but can be risky. lifestyle is the best. and you can still get pregnant if you have sex on ur period.|`|5eaJYUGCaa	Never have sex during your period. Gross, sorry.<br>  Use lube, and have him pull out before he comes so even if it did break, you would be less likely to come in contact with the semen.|`|uVL1kJr4aa	dont have sex during your perod it only increases the chance of pregnancy since the eggs are being released. 2)Plus its gross but hey..do what you want. 3) Just go and buy them your self. if that doesnt work. when your mom has time or make time and go with her. stress to her the importance. <br>  <br>  have fun!
FZKFLTyLaa	What you have now is a one-sided infatuation.<br>  Someone else needs to be the object of your affections.
vbV2SCF5aa	Me and my ex boyfriend broke up before valentines too,  I was so hurt at the beginning,  but after being single for almost a month I had time to evaluate the realtionship we had and discovered that if we were meant to be then we will be together, if your boyfriend  is out there talking to other girls, then let him see what other options are out there, and you should do the same.  Don't tie down yourself to one individual get to know more guys, and then make your options, it is best to know now, where he stands. I would never be a friend with benefits, because it only keeps the pain of the break up going. The best thing to do is to move on and don't force yourself on him,  and just continue to work on yourself.  When my ex boyfriend left, after our break, I realize that I love him, but I didn't need him.|`|Ke9h65dxaa	All I can tell you is that time wll heal all wounds but if you see each other and text it is going to take a lot more time to heal.It is better if you cut him off completly for now and let yourself heal. Take time to do things you enjoy and hang with friends.enjoy your life!

Maybe it's just a trial period for her.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	I think maybe your cousin is a lesbian, I don't think they were wrestling.  It was very innapropriate for her to behave that way with you in the room though, and she should be ashamed of herself.  Not for being a lesbian, but for having sex with you right there, I mean.  You're a minor child and she was there as your guardian, it was just plain wrong for her to behave that way.|`|6zqocFpqaa	shes a lesbian :) <br>  who wrestles in the middle of the night and is under the covers for about an hour ask her about it im sure she will be ok :) xx|`|0nNei8Traa	I doubt she'd try somein like tht knowing ur in the room.

gdPsc4OYaa	Have you ever thought about if this guy is worth it? He doesn't sound like too good of a boyfriend if he doesn't listen to you.

There will always be somebody more good-looking than you are, whoever is judging. But you are the only 'you' in the world!

WMR8hVlfaa	I graduated in 2006. <br>  <br>  Half the "popular" girls from my high school now live at home with their parents, many caring for the one-three children they already have at 20/21, most either working as waitresses or in factories or trying to get some form of education at the community college. <br>  <br>  The others are still popular, only in a different setting... but it doesn't matter because they're hundreds of miles away.

w9W3wPCOaa	Clearly you dont deserve her if thats the way you think of her and if u dont even know what to do with her.. <br>  <br>  You... FAIL.|`|2tnFQYhEaa	Start at the top and work your way down...|`|uNJirnYoaa	keep dreaming haha<br>  if you need to ask that question then there is no way in hell you have a chance with her|`|r7LONeiSaa	Start by kissing her on the lips . . . things should go from there|`|Fn3ysHejaa	lol people usually dont have secs with their moms :o
oHN6jwjoaa	you dont have to forget about him.<br>  but just let the thought of him go.<br>  everyone does what you two did.<br>  and everyone gets in the same position as you.<br>  <br>  i know EXACTLY how you feel.<br>  it hurts. but everyone faces it. <br>  maybe go out and have fun and meet <br>  new people who appeal to you.<br>  and hopefully you will slowly fade away from<br>  your friend that ignores you.|`|FgSTHArKaa	umm clearly the girl he likes is alot more classy by the sounds of it and doenst go around sleeping with ppl she isnt dating<br>  thats why he wants to pursue her and not you.<br>  im sorry but guys even though they are like that eventually<br>  know whats right for them and which girl they want to pursue|`|E7zCS7qBaa	The best advice i can give you is to go over to his apartment and let him know you need to tell him something. Ask him when a good time would be and tell him how you feel. It is best to tell males exactly how you feel, we dont understand the "obvious" things women do.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	When you have no emotional attachment it is quite obvious during sex.  --Too casual.  --Too uninterested.  --Too passive.  Too routine.  --Fake passion.  --Not interesting.  --Not memorable.  You laid down for him too soon and too readily.  That will kill anyone's interest.
FZKFLTyLaa	From your grammar I'd believe you  are just a bit young to be entering into a real romance.<br>  Give it another year or two and you'll understand things better as you mature.
dqMf8IeCaa	my mom and dad|`|AA11693263	Yes, I do. My friend married her next door neighbor. They were married for 8 years and just got divorced a couple of years ago.|`|USooqQlWaa	One of my friends dated her next door neighbor and although they are not still together they still hook up from time to time.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	well, Spiderman dates Mary Jane.<br>  i think that's as close as you're gonna get with this question.
H3WHxCgaaa	Stop posting here and get yourselves into some kind of counseling!  If you guys can't talk to someone (religious leader, therapist - someone qualified) it doesn't sound like the marriage will last...|`|fGLHYL0yaa	It looks like she has a grudge towards your parents, and because you're their son she kind of has that with you too. Listen parents sometimes can interfere that much to ruin your life, i don't know how your parents are but wither way, when once you get married you should move out on your own with your wife and kids. Your parents already had their marriage, kids and life now it's your guys turn to experience that.....Don't know what to say but your wife seems kind of controlling as well, it's like she wants to controll you in every kind of way which sucks, and i can see how you feel it's like you're being sofocated...Please be patient, if there's a way to keep your parents away from you guys for some time do so....|`|pVBH6iCYaa	dude, even the Rocky series got tiring after the 3rd one. <br>  <br>  give it up.|`|Yby3loNEaa	you need to show her that you are the man!!!!!! you let her walk all over you. so if i were you i would step up and act like a man. you are letting her play games with your head some people are un happy and they and they get pleaser out of making others un happy if you really think staying together for the kids will be better its not they can feel the stress between you two so either man up and take control and tell her she is acting like a child or leave and have peace of mind you have to think of the kids before anything else and do you want them to think that this is what is suppose to happen when you get married then it will be a patten that they might fall it to too good luck
PILm2U4Taa	If it works for the two of you, that's all that matters...|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Sure, why not?  If it works for you and your husband, go for it!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Absolutely! Are their men who do this?  Where do I order one!|`|NBDLUOkiaa	If I ever get the oppurtunity to make twice the money he does it will be a sure thing. My husband is falling apart from working so hard to support us and I would be fine with it because I know that it isn't because he would be too lazy to work.|`|GXOy8rjqaa	Sure its ok if you both agree on it.  I'm 42 and my husband is 43, he is retired from the military and I work full time.  He stays home and does stuff around the house.|`|EJWphb88aa	Well its completely personal way of seeing life.. as far as it doesn't matter the husband and wife.. y the hell should it matter me..|`|EdfW2qlyaa	i personally think that it doesn't matter which one is the one who stays home with the kids and which one is the one to go out and get a job i think you should do whatever works best in your household
5d6392a517918c69f898af7a86fa7bfaaa	The first sentence sums it all up i think. You are kind of desperate. Are you really sure this is what you even want then? Are you really just afraid of being single for too long and maybe using this "decent" guy as a rebound or safety net? You already left him before- Who's to say you won't be tempted to do it again,once reality hits and your self-confidence returns? In a way, he is probably thinking the same thing. "This is nice for now, but eventually hes probably gonna get hurt by you again". So he just dips his feet in the waters this time around, and doesn't plan on ever taking the plunge for you (just in case you bail on him). I'm sure you'd act distant and have equally low trust for him too, if the roles were reversed.|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	This is an easy one.  You've hurt him deep before.  So, when he starts to feel deep feelings for you again, his defenses go up.  It's a totally natural survival instinct.  You just need to be patient with him and reassure him that you love him.  It may take some time.  I'm impressed that he came back period.  He must really care about you.|`|VgHU5b70aa	Well, I'm not the love expert because I'm still pretty young but I'll try to help. It seems like he just hasn't had very much experience, maybe you could help him along with the relationship. If it still doesn't seem to workout I would try to find someone who better suites you. Yes, I mean dump him. (I'm sorry.) Another thing may be that he doesn't feel there's much of a connection between you and is just trying to please you. But I'm really not to sure and don't want to ruin your relationship. I hope this helps. : (
FnfHTOnaaa	mmm jessica alba is hot|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	Yes mixed women are hotter and more exotic.|`|OWVXKKLdaa	So guys like me?!?!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://photos-h.ll.facebook.com/photos-ll-sf2p/v134/19/39/539321321/n539321321_219935_7786.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-h.ll.facebook.com/photos-l...</a><br>  <br>  Hehe... I feel like guys like women who are beautiful but not the ones that look like ever single pretty girl out there. Diversity I guess... and mixed women don't ever really look the same... Maybe that's why...|`|AA11305806	Its true I think. They have traits of both. But people like unmixed too.|`|pCZ9tB1raa	No blonde hair blue eyes and a nazi attitude is all I like.
1l04qpOKaa	AS long as there was no physicial contact I guess it would be ok. But you are still very young and olders guys can be manipulative to younger girls. I would be careful and stick to guys your own age.  Sorry to lecture but it's true  :o)|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Not illegal if just a relationship.  Illegal if he takes you over a state line.  Don't do ANYTHING sexual with him.|`|I7QcHkLFaa	It is not illegal to just be around a 19 yr old. But it is ilegal to be dating and having sex.<br>  Don't do it. not smart|`|c62dd304bac916a0f0b3ead296d41785aa	You couldn't kiss or touch like you were dating. It would have to be more of a friendship thing only.|`|X9cGsOq8aa	no its not legal! the popo will trip out and think hes trying to rape you.<br>  <br>  what they dont know wont hurt =]
uBssj3Znaa	I think she is thinking too much into it and that perhaps she is a bit immature and that he just isn't going to deal with it.|`|ruczpWrGaa	He doesn't seem to be abusive.  Maybe a little firm.  But she also seems incredibly childish if she is so hung up on tricking him in a conversation.  its good that he is straight to the point.  I dont think its matter of him being abusive, because he doesn't seem to be.  It seems shes too immature and he might just be annoyed and treating her the age she acts.|`|2si53dCRaa	It doesn't sound like he's abusive, it sounds like she is an immature child and he can see that.
FdByATzKaa	Sweetie, boys don't just wanna be "friends" ... LOL... <br>  <br>  He's flirting and it sounds like he's being nice and respectful about it... not crude or saying really nasty things. Sounds like a nice boy... if you like him... give him a shove too... ;-)|`|N361k5Hsaa	It sounds like he does|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I think he's flirting with you.. He probably does like you or at least he's attracted to you.|`|cEtbRDQHaa	are you in class right now?? hhahah anywayss... see if he is like that with other girls, but it is just an "act" that he knows your his friend... guys are weird like that
FZKFLTyLaa	Be frank, and honest. Just ask :<br>  Would it offend you if I considered you as more than just a friend (or classmate)? Do you know how much I like you?<br>  I cannot understand in this age of communications why so many people have such great difficulty<br>   just speaking to one another.
F4eVMDqHaa	What's the problem? She looked over at you when you were doing something goofy? If she is worth it, then it really doesn't matter - she'll like the goofy side of you as well as the suave, cool and self-assured side. You like her? Time to talk to her and find out who she really is, and let her learn who you really are.|`|JbFToTMdaa	HAHAH!!! why you even care? :o  just keep an like before it's only you who remember that forever she will forget in a day or two ..|`|bMLdEkncaa	just dont do it anymore.....obviosuly she likes rap and was probably offended by what u were doing....she'll get over it...it's not the end of the world|`|gBvD0fJAaa	this reminds me of the song "Teenage Dirtbag" by Wheatus lol<br>  yea well dude so what if u were pretending u were a rapper? im 17, im immature but i love having a laugh i cant help it. maybe u should try and strike up a convo with her|`|1Qha5gwVaa	You are too stressed. Calm down! That is no big deal. You have nothing to fix. You were just being yourself and that is normal. She gave you the look because she noticed you and that is something.|`|KNqFM5rEaa	Go up and talk to her. Show her that your not really a dork. it could have been worse, really.|`|mTyv01xMaa	walk up and say hi. all you were doing is haveing fun right?|`|63j0onthaa	next time you see her, just tell her it was just a joke and you usually don't act like that. it was a ''caught up in the moment'' situation. she'll probably look over it.|`|SImnUCMtaa	well im a girl and i can relate to u...first never act stupid when u see that u like a girl...and second, BE YOURSELF!!!!!! and being she'll go for u...|`|QJZ7rbWcaa	Have you tried hitting her?
VnCVkHDhaa	look, if your boyfreind is relying on you to protect him, then your better off without him. if the reason he broke up with yuo is beacause you didnt fight someone for him, you clearly dont need him!|`|wZb7zilKaa	If Melanie beat the crap out of your boyfriend what do you think she would have done to you????  I was a good decision to not fight her.  Joey sounds like a punk and you should find you a stronger boyfriend who does not get beat up by girls!
0AXgXFpraa	lmao ,<br>  uhh yea she did know that u were looking, and most likely she liked the attetion, as most girls do, especially if she liked you..<br>  she never said anyhting cuz we wouldnt say anyhting, what is there to say infront of all these people ?:P lol<br>  so yeaa , <br>  just go up to her and start flirting with her and stuff, ask for her #, ask her out on a date and stuff, and yea :)<br>  good luck boy ! :)|`|9YMPSQWCaa	be really really careful.... seriously, there are other ways

AiM31dMyaa	MY GIRLFRIEND ( behind my back , looking at screen ) says it means she's interested inyou and wants you to ask her out.
DrbsbSHqaa	You do not do that
2M68xiN5aa	You can't be IN LOVE with two people at the same time. If you love someone I mean truly love someone you really do only want to be with them. It sounds to me like you and your boyfriend are growing apart
AA10784932	If its green, then i'd steer away from red. I like the Yellow idea.  But The best choice that i'd go w/ is Blue, like royal blue color. And an Ivory dress would be beautiful! Or even Brown, Green and Ivory, Like this: <a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2382898064_f07844da8b.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2382...</a><br>  I kinda like this cake. <br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/2959017464_d2ae6c96ef.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/2959...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2654191096_463415a02a.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2654...</a><br>  <br>  K. SO Green & ivory<br>  Brown, Green & ivory<br>  Black, Green & Ivory<br>  All these colors would look great together. I've changed my colors about 10 times I think, so don't stress! Hope some of this helped! Good luck!|`|NB5L3rpQaa	go with camoflauge colors, greens, grays, browns,and ivory, you could always throw in a wine color for some decor, or for some of the flowers, also, or if you go with the lighter pastel colors, for your attendents or for you cake and bouquets, such as light green,soft brown, light yellow, and a pale pink. that would also look good. you wearing ivory or pale pink would be perfect.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	I think a light Ivory wedding dress would be gorgeous! As far as the colors go, I am not crazy about maroon by itself but I think if you incorporated other colors besides greens and maroon like maybe some purple that would be pretty. I also think you could also just do light pink and green. I think the problem for maroon in June is it seems like something for a winter wedding so you should keep the flowers lighter.|`|q6GnofENaa	With green, I would do lighter colors. Go with light pinks and maybe light purple, but any darker color would make things too dismal.  But I would stray away from the oranges and yellows because then you have fruity colors which don't usually look good in a wedding.|`|oW4wjOw2aa	i really like the flicker picture of the brown green thing. Thats gorgeous
AA10887916	It's a no brainer, and contrary to the answer above, being unfaithful to someone does NOT allow them to beat you up.  Stay WELL clear.|`|iLqfdkG9aa	hmm thats sticky.<br>  I would say, stay well away from him, <br>  but then again, do you know what she did to him?<br>  She could have been unfaithful towards him or something.<br>  But to be honest he sounds like bad news.<br>  Find someone else<br>  And eventually your heart will heel<br>  Good Luck =D<br>  xxx
28d6298071cd55e7d2a470d15a36f442aa	i'm sure she wants you too.<br>  just slowly start touching back and go lower.<br>  my boyfriend does it and it turns me on, ALOT.|`|Eq5JJMvJaa	FIVE YEARS-you should have done it 4 3/4 years ago.
BHAUXSI3aa	tell her u like her and are physically attracted to her.<br>  <br>  <br>  lean in for a kiss. <br>  <br>  <br>  she will with luck kiss back<br>  <br>  make out after kiss is over<br>  <br>  then use tuongh<br>  <br>  then touch<br>  <br>  then maybe tug on her shirt<br>  <br>  then take it off<br>  <br>  then go from there<br>  <br>  this is all step by step so ull save urself so she will back off when she has had enuff|`|v2XKMN32aa	Tell her that you think she's beautiful and that you are very attracted to her, then make out with her and touch her and all that stuff if she respons positively. I've done this before to this girl I thought was ok looking but didn't want a relationship with, it worked but afterwards I told her it was a mistake and that I didn't want to lose our friendship so we should forget about what happend ahhaha it's funny because it worked.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	lol you ask as if it's not her choice<br>  <br>  tell her you're attracted to her, but don't do anything without her consent|`|M63kq3AYaa	Uh, not unless she's given you specific permission too. I wouldn't mention the running to **** about her if I were you.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	this guy needs therapy...and you do too, if you believe this crock...|`|Z2oRcejyaa	I have a friend that has the same loser boyfriend like this. He will say anything. I always say that actions speak louder than words and a guy that is not willing to commit is not a keeper. If he liked you enough he would be willing to date you RIGHT NOW!
QIwhMrBraa	no such thing as a best friend thats the opposite sex. sorry. she still fancies him, and he still fancies her. if he loved you he would stop talking to her especially if she is sending emotional blackmail type of texts, and if he didnt fancy her still, these would p*ss him off no end.|`|JJARLh3zaa	i disagree with barbawhiskey. my best friend was male and we were unbelieveably close. i loved him only as a friend and vice versa.<br>  <br>  as for your case, it's hard to tell. maybe she only DOES like him as a friend|`|rGutQhJ0aa	Thanks for awnsering my question and your very true but im only 13 so i wouldnt do anything in same bed lol there was like 10 people there that know i only kissed her but some are spreading rumours that i did alot more and your situaiton is very simular to mine a girl i went out with moved to a school ages away and i use to text her all the time but i stopped and rung my gf well  x cos of my problem more then the girl was like i thought u loved me and all this so my x gf got a boys number so it showed that u can move on as easy as he can and u make him jelouse he will relise he needs to see what you feel about this and will become jelouse of this other guy and stop texting this girl and text u more so u dont have chance to talk to the other guy you see that... so lure him back :) thank you for my awnser hope mine was helpful :)
cMY59QIaaa	You can always find hot girls on myspace or facebook, but it really helps to know the person first and often people are not really interested in dating on these sites. So your best bet is to sign up to a site that other girls signup to and look for dates on.... Of course you also have to win them over but thats a whole different question. Below you can find a couple of free dating sites, that have some hot girls|`|8Initt1aaa	Oh he's so using you for your points.
Rb087BsAaa	the best revenge is to live well.|`|POHWTDPRaa	So let him be mean and look like an idiot. If you try and get revenge you'll look like an idiot too. There is no reason to sink to his level. Just ignore it. Be more mature than he is.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Revenge is stupid, petty and a waste of time. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is ignore him, and don't let him know that his comments effect you.  He's only trying to get to you, and if you ignore him, it will bother him much more. <br>  <br>  Cut off all ties, and pretend he doesn't exist.  Live your life, be happy, and let Kharma take care of all that he has coming to him.|`|gUhcMAutaa	find a new man, show him you don't need him and that you can be happy without him.|`|ExVhN1Uwaa	dotn do anything. hell think yoru a physco chick.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	ignore him<br>  or follow his game|`|AA10458629	You really want to mess with him, be nice to him, build him up.  2 things will happen.

wW6NJk4jaa	not sure, maybe he likes you and he's a bit odd......dont worry about it =)
h1dTg5C1aa	Just friends but really likes him as a friend and wants to continue being close friends|`|kB7UsIXdaa	"I wish he never asked me that. now our friendship is ruined."<br>  keep talking to her. if you wait any longer she'll give up and let go.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	She probably feels bad for shooting him down and possibly thinks he's a bit of a jerk for blowing her off completely.|`|VFdC2wPlaa	She knows that you only want more then a friendship. When she told you she just likes you as a friend, you stopped talking to her..... which shows her you wanna date or nothing. She is probably sad that you won't be in her life because she doesn't wanna date you. If you wanna ever win her affection start talking to her... over time she may like you.|`|dd7dc75ce0c863c0c9da46c01ffc1d2daa	she is probably wondering why he's not talking to her. and feels sad that he doesn't want to be friends. =[ just stay friends, get close and maybe when she feels comfortable around you .. i mean the guy.. she will want to be more than that.|`|IW592N5Zaa	I'm guessing shes thinking that she doesn't like not talking to her friends...you should be happy she considers you a friend, Why should you stop talking to her if she doesn't like you as more than that?|`|6MyhyUDfaa	That he is just a friend.|`|dUbRn8hHaa	she was probably trying to give you guys space because its awkward. she wants to reconnect with you now and you should..just as friends tho. and maybe she might like you but you should ruin a perfectly good friendship for something that when you break up you'll never speak again.<br>  <br>  plain and simple being friends is much easier settle for that. =]|`|b58uhcneaa	Well, the exact same thing happened to me. She just wants to be friends with the guy, if anything, she is probably a little irritated about his dramatic mood swings. The guy should just act as if it didn't happen and wait for a cue from the girl|`|dspW6Gqpaa	she probobly had problems the first day. then realized that she liked you and want to be friends. but you will never know if you dont talk with her. so talk. if that doesnt work geta new girl.|`|0erdxZeHaa	I would say the girl sounds very nice and just wants to remain friends.|`|ZxlShJUBaa	shes sweet and maybe likes you or she really is sincere and just wants to be friends...|`|UGLsAJebaa	That the guy is weird,and he HAS to accept I don't like him

That way your not too dressy but not sloppy either.|`|3o7ULYoLaa	Jeans and a cute top|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Definitely a dress and maybe stockings and heels for that polished look.|`|pORmp0tfaa	wear jeans and a cute top, or a skirt and a cute top but not a super short one
dd7dc75ce0c863c0c9da46c01ffc1d2daa	its okay hun, there are plenty of fish in the sea. besides your still young, do you really want to get a boyfriend so they can break your heart? do you really think if you do get a boyfriend they will propose to you someday? (they might but the stakes are low) have fun while your young and EXPERIMENT. the human brain doesn't fully mature till age 25 at the least. especially the males.... guys are dumb, him and that girl probably won't last. so be smart, live your life, have fun, and keep positive because positive energy ATTRACTS more positive energy! its called the law of attraction! =] if you wanna talk more just email me sequin_shoes@yahoo.com =]|`|C9z5g6pVaa	hey<br>  it may hurt but you sounds young<br>  there will be plenty of guys .<br>  also think of it like this<br>  there was a reason you and this guy didn't get together<br>  thats because there is someone out there who is 100 times better.<br>  chin up :)|`|SaTa58emaa	icecream :(
2KJvaWDYaa	wow u r in quite a dilemma! im not going to dance around it though, im going to say what i think so here it is: your BF is an a$$hole and u deserve better. <br>  now, i realise that he is probably different in real life but from what i read he wont marry you because he is either wealthier or has a higher social status and is waiting for his parents to decide who he can marry and if he cant get anyone 'better' then he will 'settle' with you. that is NOT a way to live your life i promise u will be unhappy. besides, he is saying u can leave him! he is giving you a pass!<br>  hunny, if he REALLY loved u the way u love him money would b no object. it seems like uve given this guy everything but that is not enough for him. Dont feel bad about kissing another man, it is your life and if he couldnt appreciate you when he had the chance its too late now that you found another more worthy.<br>  the other guy however, sounds ALOT better! "He would fight the whole world for me"? Now THATS a man! i think you should give THIS guy a chance and see what happens. you never know, you could fall in love with him. dont let him go. <br>  the bottom line is if you end up marrying the first guy you will both have an unhappy marriage because he will always feel superior to you and he will wonder if he could have gotten someone 'better', and you will always feel unworthy, unhappy and you will always wonder what could have happened with the second guy. <br>  good luck hunny and follow your heart! i think deep down you know whats right.<br>  xx

enzt6grhaa	Wow. Well first off you NEED to immidiaitely discuss the matter with your boyfriend. You two need to talk about how you're both feeling and if you want to keep this baby. Things may seem crazy right now but im sure it will get better. and i think it will be better if you are alone when you tell your parents because this is a very serious/complicated issue that needs to be resolved with just you and your parents. later you and your boyfriend should have a meeting with your parents and his parents. Consider your options..abortion, adoption, keeping the baby, ect.<br>  good luck and i hope everything turns out okay!!!|`|yyDXbt6Baa	go and tell your parents. i know it might be hard but u need 2 tell them. yes he should be there with u when u tell them because he took part in helping create that baby and u did to so u should go with him to tell his parents as`well. just to let u know sometimes condoms dont work and if u were having sex u should have went on birth control. good luck sweetie:)|`|V6uezBBcaa	You need to tell him and your parents as soon as possible. Go to wal mart and get on some pre natal vitamins... Read the label and make sure they say that they have 100% folic acid. You need to get into the dr asap to make sure everything is okay with you and the baby! You both should be with each other when you tell... you both had a part in this<br>  <br>  I really hope your parents are understanding and try to help you out. I know its a hard time for all of you but they need to help you out so you can make the right decisions. Weather it be, give the baby up, or keep the baby. Good luck!|`|pjrRbgnIaa	first of all, calm down. its not the edn of the world. just sit down and think about this. do you want the baby? are you ready to be a mum. do you really want to bring th baby up in this environment. or maybe you should consider an abortion. just tell him right away he needs to know. discuss my questions with him. is he ready to be a dad?? tell the parents together. good luck xx|`|Fyx3gS1Kaa	you need to tell him now. <br>  your not the only one pregnant, he is too.<br>  You definitely should be together when telling parents.<br>  you both had a part in making this baby.<br>  Everything needs to be discussed and decided by BOTH of you.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|LOqlbcxJaa	Do you want da babby? If you keep your babby i think dat maybe you should tell him first before you  tell your parents. i been in your shoes before what do you think you are going to do!!!
zCE0slQ5aa	this is a perfect opportunity to get to know someone pretty well, keep them at a comfortable distance at first, and have plenty to talk about in between. you are going to help him get around your hometown, he is going to help you get around his. you have an abundance of contacts and hook-ups to pass on to one another. how can you go wrong?<br>  <br>  i would keep contact to a minimum at first and increase it gradually the closer you come to next semester. after that you can see each other in person during visits home and on school breaks. the relationship be it friendly or more will grow and strengthen the more you help each other out during the next school year.<br>  <br>  definitely an 'is' possibility! :)
ISnJu0W3aa	yea i went 2 years without it. doesnt mean i wasnt thinking bout it and wanting it though. i dont do the whole 'do it yourself' thing either so it was literally nothing at all for 2 years. it wasnt even a big deal really. but when i have a bf i really like it. whenevers hes up for it i am too!|`|LykjWv6faa	I can go years without it. I don't need sex to live.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Some women have a higher sex drive than others. Some wont have sex unless they are in love with that person. Other will have sex with anyone. Just depends on the woman and her situation really.|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	10 seconds.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	I cant go without it I dont know why guess its in my blood lol|`|wjGj6uU3aa	forever...i wouldnt stop thinking about it though|`|MWrOz6y5aa	Some women have a higher sexual drive then others. It all depends on the woman and their chemistry.|`|Gh5xtvqNaa	well.. the longest ive gone without it was about 5 months! idkk how i went that long but i did and it sucked *** ...|`|gEd1jlOEaa	I can't go for more than a week! D**K is just that good to me! lol|`|EbUSYjLRaa	i can't go a week with something it may be by my own hand
3wKGTZvAaa	If he's a good friend then he wouldn't betray you and go out with another girl. If he does, then he obviously thinks you're not worth it.
4DDSD9Syaa	Well maybe you need your husband to answer that question and make his son feel comfortable. He's the one that put his son in this weird situation. You explained to your son, now you need to talk to your husband to clear it up with him. Kids are not dumb. That is why they ask questions.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I'm 100% honest with my kids about things. My parents lied to me, and I hated it. I always felt stupid.<br>  You were right telling him what you did, that it was inappropriate for kids. Your husband should be a little more careful, some stuff can be pretty devastating for kids. Its hard to control what they see or hear, it's everywhere.|`|2bkV73gpaa	Tell him the truth:<br>  <br>  That your pervert of a husband doesn't find you pretty enough so he was looking at other women without their clothes on...<br>  <br>  ...and that will be why he will be sleeping in the dog house with Snoopy for the rest of the month.|`|2vHIn8VMaa	make ur husband do that somewhere the kids wont see it ever again!!! Anyways, i think that ur explination was very good cause it was believable.|`|pwiRMmicaa	thats good enough what you told your son,if he understood it. im sure he'll forget soon.|`|tRZlKrw5aa	u handal it perfect, telling him that bad things pop up on the internet, the only thing worst is that darn web|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	It is probably best not to splatter it around perhaps on the internet and such.  Best to let the small stuff fade away as it matters more to you than the kid anyway.  move on...
H1qpJc6Daa	you should say<br>  <br>  txt#1<br>  you: I have something important i want to tell you<br>  him: his reply here<br>  <br>  txt#2<br>  you: Ummm i kinda have feelings for you<br>  him: his reply here<br>  <br>  txt#3<br>  you: It's hard for me to say but......<br>  him: his reply here<br>  <br>  txt#4<br>  you : i like you :)<br>  him: :)|`|gRXy66dOaa	just tell him how you would tell him in person
khlYZvncaa	No, ur not wrong. U did ur job. But as I think there was some miss understanding with ur friend. So plz ask ur friend what's the problem.Don't worry when she realised it she will tell u sorry.|`|GRa8dmx7aa	i'm not really sure what this is about.  sounds like you bought your girl something and she threw it away?  sounds like she's also telling you lies?<br>  <br>  sounds like she's not really your girlfriend...|`|7ffbc6e8c9dccee75b36a7b6c1a1be30aa	No ! you are not at all wrong ... May be there is some misunderstanding between you two .. contact her and ask what the matter is ?<br>  I'm sure she will tell you ...
d99c273b914c667daa5ced5ab44c84bcaa	Guys do that. Sometimes the victory is getting the girl to like you rather than going out with her. Dont know why some do that. I would ignore him because he isnt worth the trouble if he is doing this. Just try and ignore him for a while and watch how his behaviour changes. The ball will be in your court again.<br>  <br>  But avoid him for a relationship. There are nice guys out there who will treat you well and not mess you about.|`|92ec747c8e5b26e57f7626f2af5d0664aa	I think the guy/ girl thing is changing.. It seems to be what the women used to do to men.. now the women have to beg ... the best advice is, to totally reject him,, no one can handle rejection.. so if he cares at all he will be chaseing you.. I hope this helps you|`|By2W3py7aa	well if he really likes you. My question would be DO YOU LIKE HIM ? ! ?<br>  if you feel something special just let your self fly....pz|`|5FY5SZjIaa	i personally think hes head over heels for you!|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	gota to hand it to him....fool got game...and got you...haha....silly girl|`|PXN7r0RRaa	i dont know hes ''desperate'' what else|`|GpCCJiBFaa	He's trying to play the tough guy but to me it seems like he does care. He's just doesn't want to  get hurt or rush into anything too soon and have it end like his last relationship.|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	he like you he just probably taking some time <br>  cuz of his last relationship|`|lBkLzGodaa	maybe he's afraid of being in another relationship because he doesn't want to be hurt like that again. i know that's how i feel, i was in a 2 year relationship like 3 years ago and im still alittle distant with my bf right now.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Totally ignore him.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	He sounds a bit immature, sorry.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	if he says it's not going to work then it's not going to work, move on
ptQ5SkPVaa	Just don't answer his calls or text messages. Eventually he'll quit wasting his time.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Just tell the freak what you said in your question. Be direct and to the point and let him know you have a boy friend and your boy friend knows all about him and will be looking  for him if he continues to bother you.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	tell him to stay away from you or you'll have your bf kick his a**. he should get the idea.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	wow u should get a restraining order on him hes creepy theres a lot of serial killers like that so BE CAREFUL and tell ur boss make sure u keep every text message and pictures he took cause thats crazy and show them to the cops ps be careful best of luck|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Block him. Too many people can tell you how. If you happen to see him just tell him you've already seen more of him than you ever wanted or ever want to again.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Oh boy, this guy needs to get lost. Maybe you should change your number then he won't be able to contact you.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Tell him to leave u alone.|`|NGKwsawdaa	save the texts and tell him not to text you or come see you, or else you'll call the cops, it's called sexual harassment. If you mention cops to him, he'll leave you alone.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	change your phone number, just takes one call to the phone company<br>  <br>  tell your manager at work so if the guy comes around looking for you someone is looking out for him and they can get security<br>  <br>  its not your fault, you were just being nice... some people are just idiots|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You mean after he sent the pic you didn't tell him he was a dirty perv! tell him once and once only not to contact you again or you will show his perv pic to the police.|`|o6ntWzM1aa	lose the number first, then blockit, then tell your boui.|`|aPuefPuFaa	if it's that serious tell the police.|`|ugCaMO3saa	i would say, loose him. thats ****** up.|`|iNQK27Qqaa	tell this fool to get lost|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	If you still have the original text and pic, you have the upper hand.<br>  <br>  Tell him once, and only once to stop ALL contact with you..whether it be on talking on the phone, texting, or in person.<br>  <br>  If he does not quit, go to the cops, and get a restraining order.  The picture will get it done, as far as the restraining order goes.|`|600df65ba01a2467217ddd81f1760a2aaa	Just tell him you are offended, not interested, and don't want to text or talk with him any more.  I think that's all that's needed.  By being the "bigger person" and changing your tone from conversational to proper, you're setting the tone of who is in charge.|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	Change your phone number. If he starts coming to your job that could be harassment, you might be able to get a restraining order, save all those pic's he sends you. First try and talk to him, but that doesn't sound like it will work. Definitely let him know you have a bf.|`|6tcXKcBgaa	You need to just tell him that you are not on that level. You are in a stable relationship & you are not attracted to him in any shape way and or form. & do not continue to talk to him. . .|`|opFgD3NRaa	gross. i hate guys like that. you can easily change ur number and then just send it to all ur friends.|`|Rez6KpoNaa	people can change but will u be able to let go of what he has done as long as he doesn't have HIV or AIDS i think u should give him a chance|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	wow you know how to pick them huh....hahaha....call me...1800 your ****** up|`|3ekncEpaaa	honestly i wouldnt block him, i would just tell him that you would not like to get into a sexual relationship right now, and that you would just like to get to know him maybe go out to dinner or to the movies a few times, but you have to let him know his limits because just like my brother he probably doesnt care whos around or where he is, he will do anytihng for a peace of ***... excuse my language but he will,, you deffinately have to tell him that if sex is all he wants then not to talk to you|`|AA12148432	OK, so he sounds like a twisted freak!<br>  <br>  I think you're going to have to be very blunt with him, and text him that you would like him to stop sending you pornographic pics, and texting you at all.  You're going to have to cover all your bases.  Tell him not to call, text, email or ANYTHING.  I would also suggest that you speak to the Loss Prevention agents in Wal-Mart and tell them that you do not want this guy near you.  If you see him in the building, let them know and they can escort him out.<br>  <br>  Hopefully he gets the hint after you tell him to stop texting and he leaves you alone.  I'm just telling you the other stuff to give you options.  One last option, as a last resort, is to file a restraining order.  It's a last resort, of course, because he's going to have to ignore all your previous requests and be trying to be near you all the time.  Don't file the restraining order unless you really begin to fear for your safety.  But know, too, that it's available.  This guy sounds really sick, so just be careful.  I hope it all works out!|`|BGIxDWkZaa	I can't tell you how to block him. I would ask your service provider. You can't stop him from coming into Walmart. Unless he begins to stalk you.Then you can do something. However you should be reasonably protected at your job. Start having a friend from Walmart walking you to your car when you leave. <br>  <br>  Now yeah, tell him to lose your number. I would not advise calling him a pervert (Though he clearly is) You just do not want to antagonize him. Just tell him you are not interested in what he is offering. You already have a b/f.<br>  <br>  If it gets worse, notify management at Walmart, and the police.|`|Ps0tDYBAaa	my sister went through the same thing, and shes a lesbian just tell him that if he bothers you again that you will go to the cops and charge him for harassment, all the proof is in your phone. let him know you have a boyfriend, let him know that your boyfriend knows what is going on, tell him he is a pervert and you only wanted to talk to him just to catch up but now you want him to leave you alone. let your supervisor know that this man is bothering you and if he comes back they can kindly escort him out of the premises.....  or you can do what my sister did, she took the picture of the guys prick he sent her, text it to all of her friends with the caption "Good things do not come in small packages." the guy was so embarrassed that he got the hint and left her alone.best of luck to you.|`|W762b31aaa	Sexual harassment is sexual harassment.  Report him to the police.  If you saved that pic, take it as evidence.  If you are afraid, let him know up front that if he keeps bothering you that you are going to report him and maybe even have your boyfriend get involved by having a talk with him.  He sounds like he may be a sex addict and may need help himself.  Suggest that to him if he doesn't back off too but I would definitely report him if he wouldn't leave me alone.|`|gibnbbWDaa	You have either two options, some cell phone companies will allow you to change your phone number for a 10 or 15 dollar charge or just politely tell the guy to leave you alone as you are not interested and have a boy friend. If you ignore him long enough the calls will stop (hopefully). I had a girl stalking me and eventually I had to get my number change. Hopefully you don't have to do that... Good luck!

f3b291312c0ca402f95078e3ee2e8b3faa	No, not that they don't like you, but maybe you are unapproachable? I have found if when I am walking somewhere, if I make sure to focus ahead and not make any eye contact with people they leave me alone. If I smile and say hi to everyone all the time I am always getting comments and reactions from complete strangers. Remember you attract what you reflect. If you make yourself approachable and smile a lot, don't act outrageous or obnoxious, you should be fine. Make sure you know how you act and step back to see yourself in others eyes. After you get to know someone whom you had to approach first ask them why they did not come to you first. That should shed some light on the subject. Don't drill everyone about it though then you will seem wierd. Keep it light.|`|JClRxC8iaa	That doesn't necessarily mean that they don't like you. If they didn't like you, they wouldn't be so nice when you do approach them. Maybe they are just shy? I'm quite shy so I hardly ever approach people first but when they approach me, im friendly to them. Just keep approaching them :-)|`|nWCP91q2aa	umm sounds to em jsut do what your doing nexttiem invite them soemwhere to hang out and see what they say..if you notice them liek avoiding you then that probbaly means they dont liek you sorry to say you seem liek a nice freindly person   best answer plz|`|6zCm65haaa	no not at all my friends the same ppl say that she gives them dirty looks but she dont its jus the way she is lol <br>  <br>  its prob the way u come across ask some of ya friends y they never spoke to u first or say summet like hey befor we tlked did i give off like any funny vibes they will tell u maybe they fort u were shy are u jus wanted to be left alone <br>  <br>  anyway hope i helped <br>  <br>  xoxo princess|`|ZZkInusMaa	same here i know how you feel !! <br>  they just have more important friends well thats what my friends said to me when i told them that ... <br>  it hurt me inside but i just had to make myself more noticed ..<br>  it worked i changed my look and style and raised my voice a bit to make it noticed but i didnt shout lol !! <br>  try it it might work <br>  good look|`|yuBuNoPDaa	No. Some people would always have to approach me because I was intimidated by them. I didn't know what to say anyway being that I'm shy and quiet. I don't want to come across as being nosy. I was being too sensitive and terrified of rejection. I felt I was bullied pretty badly.|`|GRa8dmx7aa	keep doing what you're doing.  there's never anything wrong with being friendly.  after a while, it will be reciprocated.

ZEitfScGaa	ha ha, wow! If you and Chicalin are a sign of the future to come, then I am very scared.<br>  <br>  You two can go on living this way, then when all of your friends are married, and have families you can go be the 40 year old women at the bar who are so desperate to find a man that you'll hit on everyone, but you'll never find anyone because you will be so desprate for marriage that you'll scare everyone away just as fast as you meet them. Pathetic, you two are WEAK.|`|xouWDqpvaa	i agree, but unfortunately society dictates that people should be married at a certain time... its so depressing that people get to 30 and panic what people will think of them but f.uck it,... their problem|`|AA10353286	Yes, it is, but most of us are not raised with any knowledge of such alternatives. So we go like sheep into the marriage trap, and end up heart broken, disturbed, disappointed, let down, broke, and/or divorced. Marriage as it stands may work well for the extremely religious, for the extremely traditional, or for those who live in very rural areas with little contact with anyone or anything else interesting but their spouse. Perhaps also for those who are very unattractive or who lack in social skills. Rarely, two people find that they are like lost souls and this last until they die. This is so rare is ridiculous even mentioning it. My grandparents were like this, I think. Then again, I also am thinking they had an open marriage.<br>  <br>  Marriage is an old arrangement having absolutely NOTHING to do with love, companionship, or much else. Marriage is about division of labor and the merging of mainly what ends up being one's financial worth. <br>  <br>  Half of all marriages end in divorce. So for whatever, people breath a sigh of relief at that, or completely ignore the statistic. "I'll never be one of THOSE people" we say to ourselves. We assume that the other 50% who stay married are blissfully married, when the truth is, only half of them are happily married. Some of them are blissfully in denial, the other half acknowledge being miserable, but staying together "for the kids". Or perhaps because they have just gotten so unattractive being complacently married that they aren't confident that anyone else would want them. It's a sad situation, and again, has nothing to do with love, and more about social expectation(and now even the government is pushing it).<br>  <br>  Then there is monogamy. It's largely a fairy tale. The idea that someone can predict with any accuracy how attracted they will feel for any one person 50 years into the future comes across to me as either arrogant or just juvenile and hyper-romantic. I'm guilty. I made the promise as well, but I've since retracted it and so has my husband. Thank goodness for honesty!<br>  <br>  We have chosen to take things one day at a time. Our relationship is currently monogamous...by choice. Not because we feel like our "contract" states that thats what it has to be. Not because we believe it's somehow "moral" to convince yourself to only have sex with one person in your entire life when you are married(even the Biblical characters didn't buy into this one, if the men could afford more than one wife, they had more than one). Our marital "contract" is fluid and flexible. We expect to change a lot in the next few decades. So will our marital agreement. We make no eternal promises to each other, just accept each other as we are on a daily basis. It's the only way I can see marriage working for me.<br>  <br>  Human beings do not believe that "true love" is exclusive, but Westerners do, mainly because of something that has been convuluted and extracted from ancient Biblical text. We perpetuate these ideas in music, movies, books, and in the stories we tell our children and ourselves. All we have to do is look around for the truth.|`|74d22a359a13b539bf60f128a3450a53aa	Sorry, Im happily married for two years.

If she avoids the subject, no future but if she says something like "awww really you think that?" your next line is "yeah of course if i thought for a second you was interested in me i'd ask you out in a heartbeat" And there you go the seed has been laid in her mind she will ask if you was serious after some thinking and you say yes, you have just asked her out without asking her out. The power of suggestion is just as good as the direct approach.|`|6E16tR6xaa	There's no easy way to do it. But I wouldn't recommend it during the class then things are just awkward.

Ask yourself this, is what you are doing, ie texting, flirting, seeing on the side.....something you would do in front of your current partner? Do you think it would hurt your current partner if they found out about it?  If you are purely in your own mind just having thoughts and admiration's but have not taken it any further then for me it would not be "cheating" if it becomes physical in any way such as seeing each other without your partner, or calling and texting each other then yes it could be considered cheating. You have to take into account what your current partner feels. Not just what you think is ok. Try this, reverse the situation, if it were being done by your current partner what would you think? Would it hurt you or make you feel inferior?|`|KIZVWREHaa	i would say it is mentally cheating cause it shows your are not committed to the person you are with therefore that relationship will probably not work out due to that person is not for you . Time to move on and save you both some trouble .|`|PXN7r0RRaa	no.. i always see girls.. undressing... me.. jocking me..etc.. sometimes i feel like there imagining themselves.. doing the..funky..with me.. but im not ''psychic''  whats cheating is when u ''Pyschically'' cheat|`|d8df68da34825a503b9a696c5c333e06aa	nope...perfectly normal.

If it was, most of us would be considered cheaters.|`|td6WXhv4aa	It's cheating when your cybering them and then take it offline and get physical.|`|WAEWC3wQaa	Well, ask yourself how would you feel if the person you're with is thinking about someone else, how will that make you feel..I'm Christian and in the Bible, Jesus says that even if a man looks at a woman with lust, he has committed adultery in his heart. I don't think everyone is perfect, but we must recognize that what we're doing is wrong, when you recognize that it is wrong and try harder to not do it again, it becomes easier to not fall for everyone in sight and your relationship with the person you're with is strengthened, if you continue to look at other people, it only makes your mind weaker and makes it easier to actually fall and commit adultery in the physical sense.|`|qMYhZSZdaa	If it is then EVERYONE in the world cheats.... you cant help what comes into your mind and how you feel.... but you can control your actions....|`|3a16f29d91dc82f5362c9dca7425ed57aa	Nope thats not cheating :)|`|S8Qpiabdaa	it depends on where and when u think about them if its in bed with ur spouse then yeah but other then that get over it
4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	He should be steppin it up. At the same time raising a kid is a lot of work and will be quite exhausting. He will likely want to see his daughter at times regardless. And, honestly, trying to find a new boyfriend that is willing to step in and be w/ you and be there for your kid is just not that easy. Guys don't often jump into situations where we're raising another man's baby. At least not at your age. You can go to court have lawyers dictate custody and child support. But I think it will be easier for you as a mother to keep this guy around and raise the child as a team.<br>  <br>  Of course, only you know best. If you think he's so inconsiderate that it will create conflict detrimental to the child's upbringing, then you probably need to separate. But I feel like it's not quite that bad. I mean, you've kept him around for five years and to me, it sounds like he's not very sensitive towards your needs. That's not a good thing, but my hunch says take him back and work through this.

7ZqSiZqUaa	oh yeah - at least to the main question; i did't see the rest of it till I came in here to answer that.<br>  <br>  i  met a bloke on the internet, and we were chatting, and really getting on well, and we swopped pics.  the next day he said he didn't want to talk to me any more because he would't want his friends to see him walking down the street iwth me.  I wouldn't have minded so much but he was no oil painting!<br>  <br>  couple of months or so later got talking to another bloke.  didn't send him my pic this time, though he asked!  but when i told him my age, he said I was too old for him.  and to add insult to injury, he asked if i could introduce him to someone younger!<br>  <br>  so not only am i ugly, i'm old and ugly as well.<br>  <br>  as for their lives turning crappy, I can but hope!!!! *s*|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	Well, kind of. My ex cheated on me with many women because I wasn't "good enough". I divorced him and moved out with our child.

l5Q8lq35aa	Laughing says that you have a sense of humor, aren't embarrassed to be<br>  you, like to have fun and are fun to be around. I think if he likes you,<br>  he'll take it as a heads up: if he wants to flirt with you by being funny,<br>  you'll always be there to laugh it off and will accept him for being<br>  fun to be around. I wouldn't think on the whole giggling 'incident.' Everyone<br>  has had those moments. If I was there, I would have laughed with you!<br>  <br>  And by the way, he probably thinks your laugh was cute. ;-)|`|Pybx037Taa	Its not a big deal everyone makes mistakes but maybe he noticed you|`|7qvaXOFzaa	No, he doesn't think you're a looser. It's just you you're over thinking about it. Good thing that he actually noticed you though. Just try talking to him saying e.g. "I'm stuck on my homework, do you get it" or "can you help me on this please?" Eventually, you'll become friends which will make things better for you.|`|7stgbWJyaa	If you're as invisible to him as you say you are, he won't care - you've got to get yourself noticed by him!|`|XXLUB8U4aa	Don't worry about it, and who knows, maybe he thought you had a cute laugh :)
skz3EqUXaa	Use positive mental self-talk.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, 90% of the time that little voice in our heads gives a neutral or negative message.  Things like:<br>  <br>  I really messed that up.<br>  I'm no good at this.<br>  I feel nervous.<br>  <br>  <br>  Replace that with positive messages:<br>  <br>  I am a good person.<br>  I care about other people.<br>  I am really great at _______.<br>  Other people like me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|EjyD1sXeaa	you should always be yourself and act natural, cos if you fake your personality you won't be able to maintain that "lie" for long.<br>  people can see through you when you act<br>  someone told me to imagine your boss or partner on the toilet - problem solved - we're all very much the same when it comes down to it.<br>  again, just be yourself|`|nMCdfOhVaa	Just be yourself and whatever you do DON'T lie because that will only make girls dislike you. You don't have to change the way you are just for a girl. Keep all your confidence in mind and just be you :)
xADIsKnVaa	As a human in 2009 you are subjected to so many social constructs and made-made institutions that carry unrealistic expectations. If the Aderall gives you an advantage and makes you work better in the (inherently flawed) education system, then maybe that's what you need to reach your potential...at least for now.<br>  <br>  Maybe you really have ADHD. Have your dad take you to the doctor and explain to them how you feel without the Aderall. Maybe you will be written a prescription for it anyway and won't have to have any conversation about it.<br>  <br>  I'm not advising that you lie or cheat or anything, but I knew lots of kids who took ADHD drugs to get through college and it made a world of difference for them even if they did not have ADHD. If you end up getting a prescription just remember to CHOOSE to use the drugs responsibly. Don't sell/distribute them to your friends (even though someone was obviously giving them to you) and only take them when you have to get things done. This kind of responsibility will also make you dad less apprehensive about allowing you to take the meds.|`|AA11108018	While it is great that it helps you who giving them to you you get busted for that.

pfjxEZBmaa	LOL!! Sounds like my first proposal. He leaned against my car and said "So, wanna get married?" In the parking lot of the mall. Didn't work out, he was too young. My now fiance heard the story and was like I'll do better when its time. It wasn't big, but it was more romantic. We were just walking arounbd outside and he told me I really want to marry this amazing girl and spend the rest of my life with her. <br>  Nothing big, but better than a parking lot. :) <br>  Don't put too much faith into a huge fancy proposal, but anything is better than "tHere you go".|`|NB4h4jTyaa	You know, a proposal from the right guy will be romantic no matter what. It doesn't have to be a grand gesture.<br>  <br>  My husband proposed to me during a snowstorm at 2am. We were just watching TV with my visiting family and he got up and went to the kitchen. He came back, slid a duct tape ring on my finger and asked me to marry him. I didn't believe him, but he kept asking. Finally I went to push him away (jokingly) and felt how sweaty his forehead was. I thought, "Oh my! He's totally serious!" <br>  <br>  He'd planned this whole big thing where he was going to ask me at this rock concert in front of all our friends, but the show was snowed out and the real ring wasn't ready. To me, the whole thing was so romantic and silly and so perfectly 'us'. I will never forget it and I was so touched that I cried.|`|cdHzzI0iaa	If you know he's the right guy then you should not be worried about this. Proposals are done lots of different ways and they are all wonderful.  The fun thing about proposals is everyone has a different story to tell, even if the proposals were similar.  Most of the proposal stories I have heard have included the bride messing up the surprise including my own.  They don't want to do the thing the groom is wanting to do, they are in a bad mood, they don't want to go out of town etc.<br>  <br>  Do not concern yourself with worrying about this... enjoy your life and relationship and most likely it will happen in just the right time.<br>  <br>  Please keep in mind the proposal/engagement are temporary and the point of all of it is the marriage.|`|kRh3slhdaa	I think your first proposal sucked like mine. I know his heart was in the right place, but asking me to marry him in a mall parking lot--well, isn't very romantic...lol, and I thought he was just joking around, until he took the ring out. Even then, I thought it was a joke. (Since a few months ago, he pulled a HUGE, obviously fake diamond ring the size of my head out of his pocket and said he'd marry me). I sputterd 'of course!' after I realized he was serious! Plus it took him foreverrr to even start getting in the mode of planning things for the wedding.<br>  <br>  So...don't feel so bad. I think even though my proposal wasn't the ideal one I thought in my head, I realized that he had his heart in the right place and he really wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. And that melted away the thought of the proposal. lol. I still bring this story up when I talk with my friends, and as stupid as a mall proposal can be, not many of my friends can say that they've been with their significant other for 6 years dating and 1 year of marital bliss... I think as long as the guy means it, that's all that matters-even if the proposal sucked. : )|`|JbRTKDFmaa	I was proposed to without a ring. My fiance and I were just laying around in bed one weekend afternoon talking, and he just looked into my eyes and said, "Marry me". I was stunned and had to ask if he was serious...lol!  It wasn't some huge romantic gesture, but it was still very special and will forever be etched in my memory. <br>  <br>  He gave me the ring 6 months later on the beach in Nantucket (island off the coast of Massachusetts). I knew it was coming because he had taken me around to a bunch of jewelry stores to figure out what kind of ring that I wanted. We were the only two people on the beach because it was early in the morning. It was sweet and romantic, but honestly...the proposal while we were both laying in bed still in our PJ's is the one I'll remember most. <br>  <br>  My point is, when the right guy proposes to you, the fashion in which he does so isn't really all that important. It'll be special no matter what.|`|cqgWkdPtaa	firstly I'm sooooo sorry mrs h, i went to give you a thumbs up and my computer was a bit slow and somehow i managed to click a thumbs down i'm sooooo sorry!! <br>  <br>  I totally agree, anything will be amazing if its the right guy :)|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	You are hoping for a better proposal. Of course, you were young and we all know how much we think we know when we are young and now we know we knew nothing!<br>  <br>  If the guy is the right guy, then no matter how he proposes, it will be right to you. My guess is that you have talked about the old proposal and how it "sucked" and he certainly won't do it that way.<br>  <br>  So relax and just try to enjoy your boyfriend.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i think its more important to focus on the future and the marriage not the proposal and the wedding.  that's why i think the divorce rate is so high in North america.  people put all thier hopes and dreams into a proposal and ring, then a wedding and don't spend enough time working and preparing for a marriage. that is what is truely important. and if you love the guy, want to marry him however he asks you will be exciting|`|29I8PWrxaa	Honestly, I don't think many women get what they imagine is the "perfect" proposal ... although mine wasn't perfect, I loved it.  It wasn't a surprise because my fiance and I had been talking so much about it beforehand.  And then when we were looking at rings he ended up buying it when I was there ... and then making me wait two months before he "proposed" and gave it to me! lol ... But even though it wasn't a surprise or at a fancy restaurant or in a horse-drawn carriage, it was special.  It's the little touches that meant a lot to me ... he got down on one knee even in the cold snow, he had a prepared little speech, he had talked to my Dad beforehand, and most of all I was just so darned happy he wanted to marry me!<br>  <br>  Don't stress about it.  It will be perfect in your eyes no matter what if the relationship is good and you two are happy.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	If you put too much hope on the proposal being the most exciting, romantic  moment of your life, you may be disappointed.  There was a girl who posted on here earlier today whose boyfriend proposed to her in a beautiful spot in Paris on her favorite holiday, and she couldn't help feeling let down by the fact that he didn't feel comfortable getting down on one knee to do it.  I think often times we build up so much of a fantasy around how the proposal will happen, no reality can live up to the fantasy.  The proposal is just a few seconds of your life.  If it turns out to be a romantic, magical moment, that's wonderful, but for many women it's not that way.  The important thing is that you marry the right because that's the marriage will last you a lifetime and you'll have plenty more moments to build magical memories together.

As for finances, we discussed it and decided that we will be fine pooling our income. Religion was never discussed and there weren't any other issues that we felt were necessary to discuss beforehand. We don't have any major issues at all and we get along well.

rsHbMpjXaa	Oh yes, very sympathetic, wracked with guilt actually. I cared very much!! I never, ever wanted to be the cause of so much hurt to another human being. It is very flattering, but there's also pressure, because you know you have to make it clear to the other person that you will not be entering into a romantic relationship with them, but simultaneously you want, if at all possible, to preserve the friendship, so you have to tread carefully. It can be very hard to keep it sweet so that things don't become awkward between you. You want to keep their self-esteem intact, and if it was a friend, you want to keep the same easiness between you, without giving them false hope.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Yes I was sympathetic!  So much so that believe it or not...I can handle being the 'victim' better than being the 'target'.   But not if the person persists on trying to get me to 'see it their way' and won't let it go when it isn't working...then I can get pretty UNsympathetic.  If the feelings aren't there...they aren't there.|`|lyWSufFBaa	I've been the victim before so I know how it feels to get hurt so therefore I never intentionally hurt someone if I can avoid it. I care about other people's feelings.|`|sPemuE91aa	Yes, I know what you mean. I am a married woman, that is just average looking but, have more like guy tendencies. So, a lot of guys that meet think that I am just a really "Cool and down chick" like one of the guys and then they start liking me for more than just friends.<br>  <br>  Well, i clearly explain to them that we are just Friends, and I do care about them but there cannot be anything between us.<br>  <br>  So, yes you want to be sympathetic but not so much as to give any mixed signals.  Your NO needs to be No, with no waivering.|`|GOaDQuhlaa	been on both sides of the issue at hand. Yeah, you can feel some sympathy for the other. Its mostly just a feeling of shock or suprise that someone feels that strongly toward you. It can either be a blessing or make you feel guilty because you do not feel the same  feelings toward the victim. I would say its mostly a shocked OH MY GOD sort of thing.... My best friend sort of did that to me in October.  I love him dearly. But I am not IN love with him.|`|an7qtWORaa	I was never the victim but I have felt bad sometimes. At other times I felt nothing at all.

ff545BLyaa	Just let it go man.  She is not worth being angry over.  People respect a man who can keep his emotions in check.|`|sX2oWidkaa	Well, you two weren't in an exclusive relationship (luckily). Unless she expressed interest in moving the relationship to that level, I don't think you should be too upset because she didn't really lead you on, even if she did admit to having a crush on you.<br>  <br>  It could be a rumor that her phone was taken away over sending dirty pictures (of herself, I assume?), but since you were friends with the receiver... If it is true, I wouldn't bother with her as a romantic interest anymore. Something about her saying she hated perversion and then sending nudes of herself to a person she wasn't even dating just raises red flags. <br>  <br>  As her about the situation if you like in the email.

BPqK0c5taa	Yea I would actually, but I'm not in that position so its hard to really relate. You would feel almost like your time with her didn't mean nearly enough as you once thought.

PrKFlCe0aa	This looks like a tricky situation.<br>  I think it might be best to continue being his friend, but maybe not talk to him about your feelings for awhile. You weren't weird or creepy at all, so don't feel bad. :) You should give him some space in that area for awhile, and then maybe he'll come around. <br>  <br>  You know, "like you don't know what you have until it's gone" kind of thing. Maybe he'll miss the affection and his feelings will become more apparent. <br>  <br>  If he isn't the one, don't fret, you'll find someone. ;)|`|AA11596133	His reasoning is insane.  He is saying that he has to feel like he has EARNED things by working for them, otherwise he will not feel like he DESERVES to feel good having them.  <br>  <br>  What that REALLY means, is he has a VERY poor opinion of himself, and is prone to falling in to deep depression or becoming extremely self centered and distant.  NOT at ALL a good person to get involved with - even as just a friend.  He will always be hard to understand, hard to please, and always thinking of himself first.  <br>  <br>  MOST normal guys would just LOVE to have a girl admit to being nuts over them.  That takes all the guessing and wasted time out of the whole dating scene.  THIS guy, however, does not CARE what you feel - in fact he does not LIKE how you feel.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but running after him is not a smart move at all. He knows how you feel already and he told you he does not want it.  Let him go.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	"Was i too 'easy to get'"<br>  <br>  ha nice try<br>  <br>  FAIL|`|bGGYy89Gaa	wow, this totally happened to me hunnie, and its still happening, but things definitely did get better after I played hard to get with him. <br>  <br>  SO yes, play hard to get, be like the happiest girl in the world in front of him.

The right guy would enjoy knowing that you liked him as well. The right guy would love you for who you are not whether it would be easy to be with you. I mean I would think the right guy would enjoy the fact that things weren't complicated, you told him how you felt, and made it easy on him. This goal oriented guy seems more fascinated with personal goals. Since personal goals have priority in his life chances are he won't be able to love anyone adequately. Honestly I would just spare yourself the heart ache and stop talking to him all together, wash your mind of him, and move on in your life as if he did not exist. I am only saying this for your own sake not to be cold to him. This isn't about him. It is about you. If he really likes you he will find you. But I would still be cautious if he did come running back because being confused and not knowing what you want can also be a bad relationship quality. If a person is concerned with how easy it is to be with you then they are not the right person. They are looking for a challenge and most of those kinds of relationships don't last because the person is just fascinated with the challenge. Unfortunately challenges normally end in disappointments. Remaining friends with someone who you want to be with does not work. Plain and simple. To say it could work is just being in denial. It is best to just move on.|`|NXF57Mnvaa	Since you are friends first. You must know something about his background. What kind of family is he from? Does he have siblings? Is he close to them?<br>  Part of or the reasons for fears like commitment or acceptance can stem from experiences with how others have treated him. The things he's had said to him by others. Like He'll never amount to anything. Things of that nature. Is he a bright student / person? Does he feel he has to prove his worth to others before he can feel there is value in life?<br>  <br>  Just try to uplift him, pray about it if you can. Talk to him as a friend.  But Also talk to him about the way others outside of your friendship may see him. As being cold or withdrawn, not giving himself a chance to grow and learn to love. or be loved.  He seems to find no value in his own life. <br>  Point out the GOOD things in his life. Things he's accomplished so far. Give examples of the ways he has touched your heart and how he is around you without him realizing it. As sometimes people don't realize or understand how they make others feel, Whether they make others happy, comfortable or on edge all the time. If he is cold towards you in one certain area. Then point that out to him. Show him where he hold value in life. Not just to you but others that know him. Observe how he is around others. Is he open around them? or does he close off from them completely.<br>  Just keep reassuring him that he is really special to you. That he means a lot to you. Be there for him. As you may be what buffers him from the rest of the hurt he hides or the things he wants to avoid completely<br>  However remember right now he maybe afraid that by dating you , if something happens and you break up with him, then your friendship may be damaged and gone forever. Some people value the friendships more than relationships. As when people separate after dating they walk away completely never to speak to each other again if the break up was really bad.|`|I7w5SZbmaa	i agree with love doctor, play hard to get. but in my opinion, i usually stick around them for a while and partly flirt (like laughing at a joke all the time)<br>  but in your case, im not very sure...<br>  maybe you can just remain friends until he can accept things|`|5pyHgpZkaa	Not to be Frank, but i think he doesn't like you like you like him (wow, thats a lot of likes).

jdah4ZA2aa	Well, if she doesn't *** before you, she probably won't *** at all?<br>  <br>  Honestly, when I get off really really quickly its usually because I'm very into the guy I'm with.  That does usually involve an emotional connection in my case...but I can't speak for all women. <br>  <br>  I hear some girls just get off easier than others though.|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	Some of us just come easier than others.  The luckiest ones not only come faster once, but several times.   <br>  <br>  It's not based on emotions, it's just that we know how to position ourselves for the best impact possible, to maximize our pleasure.   Besides, once you get older, the male stamina usually increases, which is also going on in your case.  A 23 year old female has gotten more comfortable with her self, and since she is able to relax more, she also gets more pleasure. <br>  <br>  Its not a love thing.  It's a comfort and knowledge thing.

That way, she will look stupid compared to you, because you are handling it way better than her.|`|HeVXAjwMaa	If it was me i would just say, you are not invited so if you do show up there is not going to be a place for you at the table and you will not be treated as one of my invited friends so please dont spoil my evening....if she does decide to still crash just ignore her the whole night as all she wants is to upset you and get a reaction. xxx|`|4lBw9VFSaa	u should try to convince her to stop or tell her friends to do it for u. try to talk back to her. ignore her sooner or later she would give up because people only do bad things to you so u can get aggravated  so if u ignore she will give up because u r not getting aggravated.|`|aVSHsX2Faa	you should actually just invite her.<br>  <br>  think of it this way, the more that you don't want her to come, she's gonna try extra hard to come. If your nice and invite her, she will either not come or, she will be nice back :)<br>  <br>  Congrats on the 7th of March birthday! Same day as mine.... I'll be 26 :D|`|rftEZA50aa	Change the venue and have it somewhere else but only tell a select few or change it at the last minute. Hopefully she'll turn up and no one will be there and later on hear of what a wonderful time you had. Good luck|`|X9XbaBNkaa	Let her go and then mock her for turning up uninvited and having no space at the restaurant - teach her a lesson.<br>  <br>  If she turns up at the club chances are you wont see her - unless she's psychic and knows exactly when your meal finishes and wot time you are meeting up|`|BHKlCJR2aa	change the venue and dont tell her, or if she gatecrashes and refuses to leave, you can call the cops ,if its a restraunt pub or club ask staff to get her to leave|`|v8XK80Ycaa	ARRANGE TO MEET UP AS YOU USUALLY WOULD. TELL HER WHERE YOU ARE ALL MEETING (or get a mate to do it) AND WHAT TIME, BUT MEET EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS INVITED AT A DIFFERENT VENUE, THUS LEAVING YOUR BITCHY MATE ALL ALONE LOOKING LIKE A PRIZE PLUM!!! HA HA|`|Pybx037Taa	If you feel that its necessary you should confront her and ask whats her problem and try to work things out if you dont matters will just get worse

But i do understand how hurt you are - from your own best friend doing this to you..<br>  <br>  Keep strong - Speak up & tell her , please dont be like that - as i like him to and you make me feel really low. <br>  Just say to her you still have feelings for him & you dont like what she is being like.

CnzAit2taa	well you can talk about music or you can try to get her opinion about something
AA10925759	I have always been a good guy.... I know it and have thought about it. But during my first marriage I really did not know how to handle things as I was young. Nor did she. <br>  <br>  Now I am happily married for the second time. I know who I am and I also married someone who does as well. It is a maturity thing. <br>  <br>  Yes first was the beginners manual. Do I wish that things had been different? Sure. Do I wish that life, love and all of that would have worked out?<br>  <br>  Life goes along and I can honestly say that my wife is the greatest joy in my life. We get each other.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Yes that's pretty true.  Both me and my first husband were soul mates - I have no doubt about that.  But unfortunately it was a giant learning experience, but we ended up learning the hard way.  We got it wrong, so we divorced.  Even though I'm glad the marriage is over, I still have a lot of regret.<br>  <br>  I'm on my second marriage, I've taken a lot of experirence and life's lessons with me, however I will certainly be working a lot harder at improving myself because i know how fragile relationships can be.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	My first one was a disaster from the start and ended badly,, the second one was glorious and we were totally happy for 14 wonderful years but cancer took her from me. the third was to a crazy woman who didn't have a soul nor a heart but my fourth is the charm. been almost 2 years and still havent even been upset at each other.. fourth is the charm!!!|`|UOmhBNxKaa	yes i do.  unfortunately i made all my best mistakes on my first husband, poor guy.  although he was no saint.  we got married at 21 and divorced at 32.  i didn't really know how to be a wife nor him a husband.  we were both still in that selfish phase of life.  instead of thinking as a unit we thought independently.  i've grown a lot and am now 52 and have been married for 5 years.  i'm a much better wife and partner this time around.  15 years of divorce, living alone and working on myself helped a lot.|`|sPemuE91aa	No not at all.  The first time should be it.  But, it does not always work out that way as we know.<br>  <br>  There are actually alarming statistics that show 1st time marriages end at about a 54% divorce rate.  2nd time marriages end  in about 62% or somewhere around there, and third time marriage end at I think it was something like 70% of the time.<br>  <br>  So, as you can see, contrary to popular belief, the more times that you get married does not mean that you are getting better at it.<br>  In this instance, "Practice Does NOT make PERFECT"<br>  <br>  When getting married it is not about finding the perfect person, because there is no perfect person, but the ideal is to learn to love and live with the person that you have chosen.<br>  <br>  Now there are some variables in which I would say this does not apply.<br>  If there is significant Substance Abuse, Physical Abuse, Any Kind of Domestic Violence, Sexual Abuse.  These are very real reasons why you  would want to leave somebody.<br>  <br>  Also contrary to popular belief, Infidelity is not the end all be all of a relationship.  You can work through this is the people want it to be so.<br>  <br>  So, if You get married the first time, just know that it will require some work. Just have the idea that you are both in it for the long haul.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	Yes.  My first marriage lasted 7 years, and we were both WAY too immature to know what we wanted.  I remarried at 33 and knew what I wanted, which was to do everything in my power to make this marriage work.  Things aren't always sunshine and roses, but we're happy.|`|AA11596133	People are supposed to learn from their mistakes, so yeah - learn from your mistakes and do whatever possible not to repeat them.
lK3TXGBOaa	omg i feel that way too...i recently broke up with my x and im trying to move on and all but everytime im like listening to a song or im kinda lonely i start breaking out crying...( he did me wrong). but then again i said to myself that i would get over him by focusing in school and having fun with my friends but i just cant....i mean i have that sexual attraction for him that i have never felt for no one else...it not just something sexual i miss talking to him and hanging out with him...idk waht to do... sorry couldnt help...i feel the same so yeah...|`|REwblx18aa	i think you should try being with other people if you cant be with him.  if it was ment to be it will be just not right now|`|XI7gT2Njaa	quit talking to him and find someone else duh|`|tIsI6apfaa	I have the sameee problem im 18 and  the same thing happen'd and one day i realized i need to drop the extra baggage and move on he showed me how he really felt about me last week when he basically told me i was a hoe and could never be his girlfriend soooo i found a senior in college whos the same typical boy and i still think about the boy here and there but what im saying to you is of course your going to miss him of course your going to think about him but if he doesnt love you by now then girl he will never ever ever ever love you just move on go out party hook up with different people or try different dating websites<br>  <br>  =]|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Get yourself a life , you are lonely . Start by saying a Prayer and reading the Bible .  If you follow this advice the rest will follow . cheerio .
AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|LD9fazmnaa	im a guy but u can just get one of ur friends to put the 2 of u in a corner or something hidden thats what happened to me|`|3UVPe2xraa	Don't go for the big blow-out kiss with the tongue and everything just yet. Lightly peck him on the lower lip. It would be just enough to keep him satisfied (unless he is really demanding, and in that case leave it to him to kiss you more), and it will also give you a place to go from there.|`|ebd01f2a9ac954de0f1feb8fb05fc0c7aa	Girls only??? I would want a guys help...but really the worst thing you can do its freak yourself out about it. Just let him make the move and follow what he does, it comes naturally like everyone says.|`|oFptKbCJaa	it will all fall in place, it will trust me!!!|`|oFeNwMheaa	dnt wrry it will be natural!|`|YQ1Jhgcuaa	Here is a funny and informative article on how to decide when to have that first kiss.  I think this will give you a good laugh and help you with this important decision.  Good Luck & Enjoy!|`|ytGaDM7Haa	Sorry, but it doesn't necessarilly come naturally (my first kiss was pretty weird). Maybe just admit you've never kissed if you're real worried about it.|`|U7SnmcxYaa	It's simple, lean, lick your lips a LITTLE bit so your lips are moist, and then close your eyes :] And don't forget to tilt your head the oppisite direction his is in.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Just kiss him, do not feel nervous about it, there is no technique, you have to feel comfortable and you'll be just fine!|`|HR4vMwcDaa	the basics are just lips get together and the rest is all natural. it comes as it happens and just flows. have fun :]|`|AA11140814	you're obviously too young to be thinking about stuff like this.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	That dress is very basic. My mom's been making wedding and formal gowns for ~40 years now, she said she'd charge $40 if you had the fabric already and had a pre-beaded trim, $60 if you wanted hand-beading done at the top. I would ask around at a few good dressmakers. Cheapest is not always bets when it comes to sewing but you defintiely don't want to get ripped off either! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|884v4VhGaa	The link: <a href="http://www.freudianslipsvintage.com/dress%20item%20pages/ushertullegown.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freudianslipsvintage.com/dres...</a>|`|AA11220327	your link doesnt work for me, but it really varies vastly by the seamstress. my grandmother is a seamstress, and over the years thru her i have learned that you will never find any 2 that charge the same, and your best bet is to call the most reputable ones in your area to ask about their fees and policies about bringing in your own fabric (some do not allow this)|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	Your link doesn't work, but I found the website and saw the dress on the front page. I can't tell you price because depending on the dressmaker/seamtress you use their prices will vary widely. Some will probably charge 100 bucks and if they have to buy the fabric probably around 200 and up. In some cases people spend as much for a dressmaker as they would a designer gown for a designer bridal store. So it really depends on their skill level, the difficulty level on the dress, materials, etc for them to decide on a price.
EfZRrCFbaa	Hm maybe she looks up to your other friend and wants to e her lil lapdog.<br>  Yh i would get a bit annoyed too i know loads of people like that.<br>  Its best to just try and ignore her or tell your friends whats goin on thn they can speak to her.<br>  hope it all works out.
UOmhBNxKaa	don't give it another thought either way.  her feelings are her's to deal with.  go on with your life and your wedding and let her deal with herself.|`|AA11785285	That would depend on your age, and your fitness to be a good wife to her son.<br>  <br>  If both of you are 18, no education, no jobs, no nada, she may think you and he are going to stay and move in with her.<br>  <br>  If he is super educated, and hold a great job,  and you are a tattooed biker chick... likely she's trying to shut you down.<br>  <br>  Really, not enough info, hon.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I'd feel the same way, absolutely.  Most likely, she did neglect to send it because she doesn't approve of the wedding and is trying to show her distaste for you.  However, you could look at it the other way and maybe she just forgot, or it skipped her mind?  There could be a lot going on and maybe she just didn't realize?<br>  <br>  Do you talk to her often?  The next time you talk to her, I'd bring up your birthday casually.  Just be like "Oh for my birthday so-and-so gave me this" or "We went out and did this for my birthday" and see how she reacts.  You never know, she may say something like "Oh my God I am SO sorry I completely forgot!"  Or, she may say something like "That's nice" and ignore it.  Who knows?<br>  <br>  As far as your wedding goes, leave it alone.  It's really none of her business when the two of you get married.  My MIL tried to postpone mine and my husband's wedding, and we completely ignored her.  Once you two are man and wife, there should be no one else, period -- you two should be one another's FIRST priority, hands down.  What his mother thinks shouldn't matter anymore.<br>  <br>  Don't drag your fiance into it -- I applaud you for not nagging him about it.  You could mention she forgot your card, but don't over analyze it for him.  You don't want to make him feel in the middle of a huge feud (not that there should be a middle -- he should be on your side always.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck!|`|bGGYy89Gaa	Well I would definitely think about it just like you are and be a little put off but I definitely think your over thinking it which is of course normal. Obviously she liked you in the beginning if she took the effort to send you a birthday card. Remember it is hard for mom's to let go of their baby boys ha ha, and if not sending you a birthday card is the worst damage she can do i definitely wouldn't worry about it at all!!|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	I would question this too, thats human nature, but confront her, it can't hurt, talk with her, see what her concerns are... why she feels you should wait....if she is okay with you.....get all those questions answered by HER.  Write them down if you need to.  This could make or break your engagement, you will start fighting with your fiance if you don't talk with her and get everything out in the air!!!!  You can do it!|`|GdSzrtmAaa	You are being irrational and even if she did do it on purpose who cares. You will end up getting married and that is all that matters.|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	I think she's probably a bit put off. BUT, we don't know her, how asking her son instead of a bunch of strangers?
Cb0l4QvKaa	thats a sick present<br>  <br>  also get him some beer|`|VVA3nDTtaa	Nice present.
GRSidTZZaa	well, i think being nice & cool would work well if you used both strategies together. I mean obv from my point of view as a girl i think that i'd want a guy who is like cool, but also nice& well mannered, guys are more intriguing that way cos their tough to get but if you add in the nice factor than i think it'd balance out the cool thing. (sorry if that sounds confusing). i'm not really into the rud-ish kinda cocky dudes, i mean being funny and cracking jokes is cool, but not on the girl you like or on a girl that likes you..thats not cool. well, soyeah thats what i think. lol.|`|3NkvoKtsaa	Seriously, dude. Which sounds better to you? Making a girl feel good, putting a girl down seriously, or ignoring a girl u like so that your best friend can get her? Im a girl and I would SOOOO go for the nice guy! Even if your friends think it's weird, just think, they might not be your friends... Hope this helps!|`|NUvu9vMDaa	hmm, more of a mix of nice and someone who kids around a lot. the cool is boring and they need to be a little bit more fun and outgoing, or else that makes us question is he embarrassed by us?|`|2UFhModAaa	A mixture of all 3 is pretty.  much the perfect guy;<br>  <br>  Soft and "chewy," meaning sweet and nice. A guy who is mannered, as you said. <br>  <br>  For the joking, don't make fun of girls...atleast if you like them! It will send mixed messages.<br>  <br>  For cool...don't be obvious around girls, but don't act like snobby
M04IWPXsaa	That's why I recommend becoming friends first. Just cause a guy thinks you are cute, doesn't mean you need to jump the gun and be their girlfriend.|`|7oiBFIguaa	What my friends do with there girlfriends is like hold eachother or hold hands and walk off and just hang out and talk.|`|a7LvtYi0aa	find a way to open up to each other. thats why dating first is better.|`|e9f9B5B3aa	dnt be nervous around him. DUH.(:|`|1603X5vGaa	hmmm you should ask him to hang out more you guys just need time to ajust to being bf and gf now

They are both your ex's for good reasons. Personally, I wouldn't give any of my ex's another chance. When we broke up, I was always 100% sure we couldn't work it out.|`|81cb1ce39da4213ebe7cbc833cc3f808aa	Are you someone who people often say is, "too nice"? Do most of your relationships end because someone has cheated/treated you terribly? <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to sound corny, but it sounds like you might be someone who gets taken advantage of in relationships. Maybe, just maybe this happens because when you feel desired, you are willing to take a lot of crap. Men pick up on this subconsciously, and loose respect for you. It is a vicious cycle, then treat you like even more crap. It is a self-esteem issue. (Something probably most people have struggled with at some point).<br>  <br>  I don't know if that is true for YOU, but the bottom line is no. Most men who abuse women are MASTER manipulators. He already knows exactly what you would need to hear (or the old you) in order for you to take him back. Don't do it. You know this deep inside.<br>  <br>  With the other guy, you have to move on. Seriously, he will never respect you if you go running back to him after he so casually left you for someone else. In his mind, you will always be the fall back girl, and never his dream girl. Don't go out with him simply because he thinks you handled the break up well. That's not going to make you the girl of his dreams, but rather just ole' reliable. You are better than that!!!|`|NTUr0t3haa	Not all men do this. Narcissistic men do it. Usually they are suddenly single or are messing around with another woman's head by contacting an ex (you). Had they truly changed, they would have the integrity to stay out of your life. Instead, they try to worm their way back in. And it's always out of the blue because (a) it's on THEIR schedule, not yours; and (b) they hope to catch you off-guard.<br>  <br>  My suggestion: forgive them in your head but never reply to them and never have any further contact. Your forgiveness is not really needed by them, nor do they care about it. It would be for yourself.|`|QCmRRbABaa	Keep going. Give them the indifference they deserve without remorse. Meet more guys, until you find the right one for you. If in the future you meet some abusive man, at the very first disrespectful behavior with you broke up, after telling him : "Abuse? No, thanks. I deserve better", or "I'm too cool for you. Good -Bye"|`|fRIEHBJOaa	you can forgive someone and not BE with that person or DATE that person...or even let him know you've forgiven him.<br>  <br>  just move on. you don't OWE these men anything. they arejust going to bring you down. don't let them. walk forward and never look back.  ESPECIALLY don't talk to the abusive guy. you'll get sucked right back in. <br>  <br>  as to what you should do, DO NOT CALL THEM BACK. they messed up and now they can't be with you.  it's THEIR lesson learned. i wouldnt even call them or acknowledged their phone calls. NOTHING. oh well...they'll get over it. trust me.|`|djUMvICoaa	You take care of yourself.  That means without the men who are screwing with your mind for that's what it comes down to.  They say it takes 6 months to get over a relationship, to reconnect with feelings that were hurt terribly.  Going back to one of these guys or seeing them, talking to them is like going back to step one of a fifty step program.  Can you put yourself back into that relationship or even afford to put yourself back at step one if you have your mind about you right now?  You are still thinking clearly, with your head but your heart is trying to tell you something else.  You have to listen to your head.  Your peace of mind is at stake and you have no way of knowing what these fools are up to.  The one thing they know is that they were able to use you, abuse you, and when nobody else wants them they think you'ff be foolish enough to let them back in. DON'T!!!|`|6tcXKcBgaa	You need to stay single for a while,  you will know yourself how much time is needed. The abusiveEX no no, you will ruin yourself if you go back with him & the phoneEX just whatever. You need some time to yourself, you have clearly lost contact with your expectations, nobody should ever take any of that from a partner. <br>  Everything happens for a reason.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	you can forgive but don't you ever forget what happened <br>  <br>   I would not respond to either of them and see how it plays out|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Tell him there are consequences to his actions.

TWNh6Dooaa	Please don't listen to people who say "he'll come along when you don't expect it" and "don't look for him, he'll find you".<br>  <br>  It's UNTRUE.<br>  <br>  You HAVE to make an effort. I have no problem asking guys out for that reason. I have said it before on Yahoo Answers - I know a lady who is now in her 50s who NEVER met anyone because she waited for her "prince to come" and all that rubbish - in the end, she simply never found anyone to settle with, and is mid-50s, single and childless.<br>  <br>  She wanted kids, marriage, the lot, but just never found anyone. <br>  <br>  People DO end up alone through no fault of their own. It's not true that everyone finds their "perfect match".<br>  <br>  This might not be a popular answer but if you are serious, I would urge you to listen.|`|YoyGzi2Aaa	I met my girl on Y! Personals.

A woman that covers herself is not trying to attract a man on base principles. Women have had enough of men being attracted to them because of the beauty of their forms, face and hair rather than the ( intelligence ) of a creature of God that He created for a serious purpose. <br>  <br>  Men cannot guide a woman just with sex only, and if a man is dumb enough to think that sex can guide a female and same with a female, then the marriage falls apart and the relationship tumbles down. Guidance comes from the brain ( intellegence ), not from any other part of the body. Guidance must manifest wisdom and since you are the second self of God, then the man must bring to you wisdom and truth that is from God, because the only thing that can maintain the woman of God is the word of God, rightly brought from a man who is in the image and the likeness of God<br>  <br>  The Old Testament says, “A virtuous woman is more precious than silver and goldThere cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of  (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, “Behold I make all things new.”It is only through her that we live again, and again, and again. It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that  (God) desires for His creation.<br>  <br>  In Holy Quran and Bible woman is three-times the value of a man, because she brings forth life.  Women teach and train the offspring. So, if you are an ignorant, unlettered and foolish woman, you will make a foolish people, but scriptures says GOD raise foolish people or a people lost knowledge of GOD. <br>  <br>  She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building. Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come. Love is the most awesome creative force in the universe. <br>  <br>  Love is the basis of (God’s) Beneficence, Mercy, and Forgiveness. The true life of marriage is based in the quality of love. Where true love exists, we can weather the storms of life and its ups and downs. Where true love exists, we will be faithful through sickness, poverty, and through whatever difficulty life brings to us. Therefore, to accomplish the goal of the union of two people is to gain the incomparable quality of true love.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	I was in your situation once... I was thinking how to get out of it too.. then I bumped into this book called "Love will Find you" by Kathryn Alice... If you can, try and get it.

Just don't make the mistake of wanting to love someone and be loved so badly that you put blinders on and can't see that persons true being.

LzJJn1m7aa	Dude she needs to get rid of that slut friend of hers...no I dont see it as cheating altho i do understand why your gf was hurt and ticked off. she shouldnt be at you tho only her friend!!! She totally seduced you!!! ugh! <br>  You will just have to give your gf time after apologizing and explaining your side. Sometimes as girl it is WAY HARD for us to understand how crazy a mans sex drive is-esp since our sex drive isnt even close to that!! But just pray that God will show her that you truly tried to not do anything and really didnt and that all will work out. If anyone can work on her heart HE can. Also you prob already figured this out, but never be alone with a female that isnt her ever again-EVer! No matter how good of a friend she is that will help you avoid this situation in the future=).. good luck hun=) sorry this situation sucks but i applaud you and respect you for doing the RIGHT thing by not giving into her and then putting her out!|`|jTB1tfG6aa	Well, I personally would have been upset with you if you were my boyfriend...i wouldn't have done anything to her if I were you, not even the spanking. i would have just told her to get out (not that i've been with a girl in that kind of way). <br>  <br>  I imagine your girlfriend is upset because you let her in the door then let her arouse you and turn you on...and still looked at her naked, got turned on by her body, spanked her, etc. I know (not for a fact, but most likely) she is most likely verrrrry jealous...and obviously upset with you.<br>  <br>  She'll probably forgive you eventually, but she'll never forget what happened. I wish you two luck :)|`|tfuUIec0aa	You should not have touched her. That was where you crossed the line. You should never of picked her up or touched her behind. Yes, I personally believed you cheated. Now you need to pick up the peices with your woman or you're going to lose her. Never talk to this "friend" again or conflict may arise.|`|uBssj3Znaa	You probably shouldn't have spanked her, but if that is truely all you did, then no. At least you got rid of her and told your gf what happend.
1f333cc1fc67ffacc60cc00afcd82a36aa	You have a lot of self control. I would say you did not cheat. Her "friend" is a $lut. Your poor girlfriend. She probably doesn't know what to think. Just be patient with her. Her "friend" will probably deny the whole incident and maybe even turn it around on you - be prepared.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	HAHAHA.  If that is really what happened, that is f-ing funny!  I think your GF should be mad at her friend who shoved her *** in your face and stripped down naked!!    You are at no fault.|`|7k7mqSuEaa	If you had kicked her out before the spanking I would say no you did not cheat. But by spanking her you did cheat, in a way. If my boyfriend had done that I would be very very hurt and upset. Its good that you did nothing more but you shouldn't have done as much as you did. I hope you can work things out with your girlfriend.|`|eNjMj48Kaa	WHAT A SKANK! She never should have done that and your GF should get rid of that friend NOW! You did not cheat but it was NOT appropriate for you to spank her!? You should have said get the F**K off me hoe! Like omg, u should not have even touched her.|`|jpkh1JqRaa	Actually that is technically cheating. Just because you didn't kiss or have sex with her doesn't mean you weren't spanking a naked woman. Your girlfriend obviously feels as if you put yourself into this situation. The only way to get her to talk to you again is to prove that it's your girlfriend you want, not the naked one.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Technically it is not cheating BUT you should have just told her friend to leave instead of spanking her - after all she was still naked and probably only wanted it more. it is good that you told your girlfriend but her friend probably told her another story which will make things worse. Now if YOU enjoyed spanking her or whatever then yes it is cheating emotionally on your girlfriend.

K3a2fcq8aa	easy and simple..put your dick into her vagina hahahaha!
n4nOgLToaa	Just be yourself! That's the best way to go. & just be confident. Try and talk to her alone and see if you share some of the same interests. I'm sure she doesn't think you're "dull and boring", she probably thinks you are just quiet and a bit shy. But sometimes that's really attractive. It shows that you're not the type of guy who is over confident and cocky. I'm sure you two will hit it off in no time.<br>  <br>  best of luck :)
Mi6fS4v5aa	well i went through something like that and it was hard. She is a victim of domestic violence and for that she can put her "boyfriend" in jail. If you can, try and talk to her when she isn't around him or around their next break up.<br>  <br>  Try to express to her how you feel and if that don;t work, try counseling or get the police involved.

TodNRYSlaa	I'm starring this question :)<br>  The exact same thing is going on with me, except I'm a girl. I thought I was bisexual for about a year, & now, after having some of the strongest feelings I've ever had for other females - much stronger than any I've ever had for any guy - I barely think about chicks anymore.

You need to tell him to confront his parents, and if he won't you should do it for him.  It is your business, because it is your child that they are hurting by not paying him.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	speak up. if your boyfriend won't do it then you should. this is wrong of his parents especially with them knowing how the economy is and the fact that you two are raising their grandchild. even if they don't like it atleast you tried. but don't start off with a nasty attitude be respectful.|`|UXf6g6Sjaa	The thing to do is to get documentary proof that he has not been paid.

MBYtokXoaa	sounds to me like he is interested. he's just trying to be sweet and stuff just in case you don't feel the same way. putting his number in your phone is like asking for you to talk to him more. i say you play along and try and talk to him a bit more. just play it cool til he opens up to you completely. and never prejudge whether you two are too different to be together. he could surprise you. and sometimes someone completely different from you is just what you need. go for it girl :)|`|2tn8EALqaa	it isn't rocket science. text him and ask if he likes you.|`|xYXVd6xBaa	I think he likes you but he is afraid to admit it.

wovoZ5Z0aa	What you're feeling is common, but there are any number of reasons that he found another relationship and you have not.  It could be that your standards are higher.  It could be that his standards are not high enough.  Chance and drive also play a role.  <br>  <br>  It is natural to FEEL this way after a breakup, but to hold on to this feeling does not make sense.
otTMXJvRaa	Hi Cricket,<br>  <br>  You sound like a very nice and sweet young lady. Can I assume that you’re about 14?<br>  <br>  That’s a bit young to be seriously dating a BF.  Age 16 or 17 is more like it.  You’ll be less impulsive at that age.<br>  <br>  However, if you’re old enough to date, and your parents say OK, then here’s the advice.<br>  <br>  Let’s call the guy “Romeo”, OK?  From the way you write (which is cute), I must also assume that he would be your first BF. <br>  <br>  Since you already are Romeo’s friend, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find out how he feels about you.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could drop a not-so-subtle-hint ("Gee Romeo, it really wouldn't take much for me to get a crush on you… because you are always so nice to me!"). Note the statement is a gentle open door, not a smothering declaration of undying love.<br>  <br>  That'll leave the ball in his court. Give Romeo a few days to think about the possibilities (i.e., don't expect an immediate answer). He'll take the bait if interested. If not, big deal!!! You'll be able to find another good guy later on.<br>  <br>  Now, let's assume for a moment you manage to snag Romeo as a BF... what then? That's something you need to start thinking about. Getting a BF isn’t the end of your journey... it’s only the beginning.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. would be helpful for you to think about while dreaming about how to find a nice Romeo to date.<br>  <br>  Cricket... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early.<br>  <br>  Your parents should say OK and meet the guy first. And stay a virgin (i.e., no premarital sex) until you get married. Keep in mind that the decisions you'll be making from now on will have a large effect on how the rest of your life will turn out.<br>  <br>  In High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. Just remember that.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry! <br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  Cricket, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will be mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".<br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any events with drugs or alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  Cricket, just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  Meeting guys you don't know via the internet is a bad idea. Stick with guys you know in real life.<br>  <br>  You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture for you to look at, Cricket.<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife.<br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  - Charlie<br>  <br>  P.S. - Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to join sports teams at school. There will be less free time for you to dwell on BF, crush, and teen issues. Plus, you'll be in good shape, and you'll look cute in the competitive outfits at the games. Guys are absolutely fascinated by female athletes, and love seeing them in shorts and t-shirts... with minimal make-up... and they won't care if you are sweaty and your hair is a bit messed up. No kidding. You'll have more boys looking at you than you ever thought was possible. And your wardrobe costs??? Essentially zero! In addition, your Coach will be around to keep an eye on you and give good advice if you need it. <br>  <br>  Finally, you'll develop more self esteem, confidence, self control, better judgment, and you'll be much less likely to get into trouble. You'll be stronger mentally... and later when you start dating, the relationships that develop will be more stable. Guaranteed 100%.
qYrrEVIMaa	do you know if she has ever had a boyfriend before? if she hasn't she might just not know how to treat you. i behaved in a similar way with my first boyfriend because i felt awkward. didn't know how to act like a "girlfriend instead of just a friend. the cold shoulder could also be a defense mechanism. you said she seemed interested before so she might just be trying to protect herself from getting hurt if it doesn't work out. also do you know how close she is to her parents? like if they have a strong hold over her judgement? if she really cares how they feel maybe she is getting a guilt complex for lying or sneaking behind their back to be involved with you. this is probably the most dangerous frame of mind she could be in. guilt could make her resent you which would also explain the cold shoulder. maybe you should just explain that her actions are confusing you. also maybe confirm for her (if she hasn't figured it out) that you DO like her and want this to work out and you'll wait for her to get her priorities in order. once you do that it DEFinately wont hurt to lay off contacting her. just be her neutral friend. give it time. if she still keeps confusing you maybe she just stopped being interested. in that case move on. but give it TIME!. you don't your actions to be misinterpreted as desperation or neediness. a very nice kind ultimatum!! <br>  i hope that helps you.|`|0Y5W7nTSaa	I toatlly understand the way her parents don;t like her dating and how hard it is. She is probably like me is that when she starts dating she get all these thoughts (maybe bad maybe good) and start acting weird. This may be her first real boyfriend and is not sure what to do or say. It happend to me. I sort of have an idea of of how she feels and what is on her mind. D you guys talk through email too? Maybe I could talk tot her and see whats wrong. I don't know. I'm just trying to help.|`|dtGy6YPYaa	i think she thinks its just alright to not sit with you I mean, perhaps she thinks since you two are going out there isn't much to worry about and she's like relaxed about it and such. Ask her if she's avoiding you.|`|PCDuyf8raa	do you really expect me to read that? dude if shes giving you the cold shoulder  then let her out of your mind, dump her move on!|`|VagRIJlEaa	Wow, I can't believe I actually read all that.<br>  <br>  Gl with your life, let it play out and decide from there. =]|`|5oflV3OVaa	I'm no expert, but it seems she feels bad shes keeping this bf/gf thing a secret.....or she feels bad about something concerning the relationship.......when you text he you should ask her if something is wrong or etc.|`|PPlagXIzaa	If you like her alot then see if you can fix things and hang out more. Maybe she is just busy or had to get to class and couldn't talk. Don't ge too into all this, its not such a big deal<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|rdcUOa1zaa	i think you should wait til yall go on ur date. and maybe on the date talk about how u feel like shes avoiding u and stuff.
zJBbEt6Maa	One day when he's at school you could just cover the game system in like 10 blankets and let it run for about a half an hour. Do that and I'm pretty sure it isn't gonna work no more. Though I suppose that should be a last resort.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	tell your parents of take the game away from him. even if he gets mad he will get over it.|`|iJjN3KrLaa	Leave it alone. It's not your problem. If this happens while you're babysitting him, tell your parents that he's refusing to cooperate.|`|AXj4OnZBaa	watch this video:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTbYUd1jUc4&feature=bz303" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTbYUd1jU...</a><br>  <br>  “Playing video games all day, alone and friendless is simply the best way that we have to prepare our children for a life of solitude in a barren wasteland.” HAHA<br>  <br>  yeah don't worry about him, all boys LOVE video games, but you may have to threaten to take it away, or set up a certain time slot in the day where he can play.|`|oE0JCu89aa	Tell him he won't get girls by playing video games all day.<br>  <br>  Punch him if you need to, but get him out of that addiction. It will ruin his teenage years.|`|ewOD5x0taa	Throw his gaming consoles out the window.|`|kfquQqZsaa	take it away and when he does his homework give it back. get parents involved.|`|Q6ywHFhOaa	one - 1st person was right take the controllers from him, but he might get mad again lol. so just tell mom & dad. if he doesnt listen to them either send him to boot camp.<br>  <br>  two - take the controllers from him & tell him to do his homework first before games. and he'll listen to that.|`|3V08vPBSaa	well if your just trying to get him off the video games try setting the parental lock when hes not home, you can set it to only let him play at certain times.|`|7oiBFIguaa	Take his comptrollers or something away from him.|`|EvIWKqpDaa	Your parents need to take control of their child.
xYXVd6xBaa	Lets see, he could be hinting at the fact that he likes you? OR...he may be gay.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Sounds like he is keen for a slice<br>  <br>  Are you a guy?<br>  <br>  Doing is learning!|`|6gPCA7jHaa	He is trying to holla at you. If you like him do you. If you don't let him know the relationship is not like that.|`|XIFLOYVuaa	About the guy --> i think hez interested in you and wants to find out if you are already seeing someone.<br>  <br>  About you ---> i guess you are pretty stupid for not understanding such a simple thing and posting a question here|`|5372aOmFaa	i think he wants to get with you.. tell him you are looking for someone, and you met a guy.. see what his response is.|`|lrJopeC5aa	He wants to know if your available to date because he wants you.|`|FOkXngsOaa	It's possible that either he likes you, or knows someone that likes you. He might want to see what your feelings are towards him or someone else.|`|AK5SZ9pDaa	get another friend.<br>  unless if your gay, which im not saying that you are or aren't.|`|nfTympO4aa	He's a fag.|`|j915JNCYaa	more than likely...HE LIKES YOU!<br>  but he is trying to disguise it but is doing so very poorly!!!
bsqYJ0suaa	Lack of compromise, lack of respect, border-line alcoholism, and the wrong kind of friends equals unhappy marriage. <br>  <br>  Don't waste anymore time. You need to speak with him, calmly, and express to him that you don't like it when he goes to the bar without you. The point is, you don't want him going to a place like a bar to hang out with who knows who. All in all, a bar isnt a good place for a married couple. You must clearly express this to him. <br>  <br>  Second, there should be no excuse to not pick you up from work. You should express to him that when you need to be picked up from work and he is available to do so, that he must. <br>  Being at a bar is no excuse not to pick you up. <br>  <br>  As a husband, he must have respect for you and you must have respect for him. He shouldn't hang up on you or verbally abuse you. You need to speak to him on all these issues. More importantly, when you speak to him, it must be done calmly. No violence or yelling. <br>  <br>  So you must mention all this to him soon. Don't wait for an apology, you may not get one any time soon. <br>  <br>  Counseling is an option and above all, the two of you attending Church is an even better idea because under God anything is possible.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Yeah I would be gone. Sorry but thats a little out of line to leave you at work for that long. A bar? You sure it's just friends?<br>  <br>  <br>  I would definitely leave his a s s for a while till he can figure his life out. I wouldnt really stay or go back anyways. But thats your choice.|`|bjt4M3Icaa	Yes. Pull up to the bar come friday afternoon and see what "buddies" hes hanging out with. Sounds a little fishy that he got angry about your suggestion of him picking you up and going back to the bar.|`|1fa1d82a6a831651d482ff85ed3b01dfaa	He isn't acting married so talk about a separation and see what he says.|`|gRXy66dOaa	WOW<br>  <br>  if i was your husband i would treat u with love unstead of treatin u bad|`|GdSzrtmAaa	You should divorce him or try marriage counseling! You deserve better!!|`|krQiDGCHaa	Ridiculous to me.  You should be your husband's first priority.  If he has the luxury of leaving work early going to the bar for the afternoon with his friends, good for him, and he should exercise that.<br>  <br>  However, there should be some sort of compromise.  First off, if you need to be picked up, he needs to immediately leave the bar and go get you!  He is your husband, and there is no way a man should leave his wife waiting around for him for ANY amount of time while he is out drinking.  Bullsh*t.<br>  <br>  Also, you could try to talk to him about how it bothers you that he gets so hammered in the afternoon, because then the two of you can't go out in the evening after wards because he's too buzzed.  Ask that he keep it to just 1 or 2 drinks with his friends, and stay at the bar with them for only an hour or two.  That way, he is refreshed and ready to go for the evening with you, and you two can actually have some quality time together.<br>  <br>  If he is completely unwilling to compromise and unwilling to put you as his first and foremost priority, then I would definitely reevaluate the marriage.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ml2FDYECaa	Now, your issues with him going out on Friday nights are one thing, but having him leave the bar while drinking is not such a good decision to make. If you let him have his Fridays to hang out with his buddies, which is understandable you should give it to him...that's it. Now, your issue with him treated you bad is another issue, which I believe you need to talk to him about...GL|`|REwblx18aa	talk to hima bout it nd if he still acts like that it might be time to leave him|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I would be hurt too.  Has he not got a clue?  Does he ask why you are not speaking to him?  He was way out of line.|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Time to leave the party is over|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Alice W read my thoughts.  Check into these so-called 'buddies' and find out exactly who they are, it seems like he might be hiding something.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	leave his sorry ***<br>  if it was me i would give you more fun in 5 minutes than your've had all yeah <br>  What a loser he is|`|AA11990465	I think he has no respect for you at all and it's time for you to live your life the way you would like. Maybe he will come to his senses when the shoe is on the other foot. If it were me, I would go out on Fridays just like he does, but I would go to a separate place and enjoy myself without him around. Although things could be worse, I would say that it's most likely that they couldn't get much worse than they already are. Make yourself happy because nobody else can do it for you.|`|lyWSufFBaa	1. End the silent treatment.  How can you achieve anything without communication.<br>  <br>  2. You need to talk to him and let him know how you feel. And also let him no that his verbal abuse will not be accepted. You are his wife, not a stranger on the streets and you should be treated with respect. <br>  <br>  3. Little affection...if he hasn't already cheated I'm sure he has thought about it. <br>  <br>  4. He needs to get his priorities in order. If he can't seem to do that then you can either consult a marriage counselor or think long and hard about if he's worth holding on to.
FZKFLTyLaa	Tell him she wants to go out with him, simple as that. The worst he can do is say no.
OB1fa0vjaa	Don't be blind.  He is in love following you.  Still he is scare of what will happen, so you have to make the first move before something unexpected happens.  Boys are idiotic and would not be easy to talk to a girl thinking that it be rejected.<br>  <br>  Go say hi, and talk to him for a while.  He would try to avoid you because he will be nervous, but still he like you, and you like him.<br>  Bottoms Up!|`|455LuvCzaa	I think he likes you, and also that you should talk to him if you like him, if hes too shy and you dont talk to him he is going to think that you dont like him and then try to get over you and probably get over you|`|AA11963278	You lucky girl :)<br>  <br>  Yeah he definitely likes you.<br>  <br>  You really, really need to speak to him. Go up during/after class or something and just say something simple, like 'hi'. See how it goes from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Yes, it is obvious.  And you should talk to him more often and hang out too.|`|WEYvpdNwaa	If he looks at you as much as you described, then he definitely likes you. Do you talk to him in class at all, or are you in the same group of friends he is? If not, then maybe he is scared to say hi or talk about something because he doesnt know you too well. Try saying hi in art and ask him about something he is working on. Or if you dont like your teacher, be like " wow Mr. or Mrs. ____ is so annoying!" <br>  <br>  A simple hello could lead into what are you and your friends doing this weekend. Just see what he is going and say your friends were thinking of doing or going to that same place too. Simple things can lead into a relationship.|`|1y6rHlqDaa	of course! GO AND TALK TO HIM.....im not sure if its love or simply some crush...but definately something is there. FIND OUT!!!|`|wuZXqYPGaa	aaaw puppy love. ya i think he does, guys r shy especially when u guys r juniors... he seems like a shy guy who just cant really express his emotions to you. but no worries maybe he will eventually actually SPEAK to you haha :)|`|51c4ff8fca7798e711a5ba0af235b2b2aa	HELL YA BABE .. go start a convo... he's tooooo shy so u gotta step up|`|EURSXI0Faa	sounds like a creeper...but maybe you should actually talk to him!|`|OEATSehSaa	he seems to like you.find it out|`|9XlQdh2Aaa	Well he's obviously interested in you.

If he cant say anything then its his lost move on to the next dude.|`|zjGAlILlaa	START A FRIENDSHIP and let him feel not so uncomfortable! show him that you like him and if he likes you then he might just come out with it or he will start to flirt back and you will really know! but it seems promising. good luck|`|9P2yKjOQaa	yep he does but too shy|`|82163eeb88eeb393905532febf8a4276aa	he definitely likes you.go 4 it.best of luck|`|TSgY6pMpaa	It seems like he does he's just too nervous to talk to you because he'll think he'll say something stupid, i've had someone like that and now we're pretty close. i'd make the first move and talk to him:]|`|lKyf18qdaa	oh jesus yes he does.<br>  he has a major crush haha<br>  if you like him too talk to him :]|`|AGxDqnxSaa	Aww ya thats so cute...it defentaly sound like he does :))<br>  <br>  Please help with mine <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atks7y.iMGQu_bESmPKvACfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304144459AADN7F1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ocps5AAQaa	def. he likes you. you should talk to him!|`|XXLUB8U4aa	It seems like he likes you and wants to talk to you.  You should try saying hi sometime.  Maybe it would break the ice.  Good luck :)|`|Zd5T9m23aa	huh, i am not sure but i think he does like you. why not trying to say hi one day. if he talks back that might make him less shy and he may ask you out.|`|jL1w3LLgaa	Yes! Lol obviously. (:|`|b8bfdfc9471ef74c8c46b246e529a367aa	I THINK THAT HE LIKES YOU BUT DONT GET YOUR HOPES UP BECAUSE I COULD BE WRONG.|`|AaDDaimjaa	Wow, I'm going and through something similar. But, being the negative person I am, I ignore it and say that I was blowing it out of proportion and I'm just imagining things, "Must be a coincidence". Anyway, it's happened before and it turned out he did, and getting past the awkwardness was easy because we had a lot in common.<br>  <br>  Eh, but I would say he does, if you're totally sure he's looking at you. Smile more and try to talk to him or something.|`|xggCmn2Iaa	yeah, it really looks like he does.  if you like him, you should ask him out since he seems too afraid to say anything.|`|WB6G1uJ1aa	Oh yeah... He likes you. Try talking to him so that you guys get to know each other.|`|D1ErKvAiaa	ok, well either your super over observant or he does like you. just understand that you're all juniors, i personally don't agree with people that young dating (im not 89, it's just how i feel) so just don't rush things. you guys can be friends and it'll be cool, or you can date. whatever suits you. and what i hear HE DOES|`|ReK7vsmaaa	Well that sounds like he likes you, Ive done those kinda things when I liked a girl. Here is some advice from a guy. When you walk by his locker one day, Just smile at him and walk over and ask him if he wants to walk you home after school OR ask him if he could give you his opinion on something you've drawn after school.<br>  Heres how you should make the conversation: *ACTION* & "TALKING"<br>  *Walk Over ALONE!* (Lets say his name is Ben)<br>  YOU: "Hey Ben, I Was Wondering If I Could Get Your Opinion On Something After School."<br>  BEN: "Uhmm Sure."<br>  YOU: "Thanks Alot Ben, Could You Meet Me At My Locker After School?"<br>  BEN: "Yeah Sure."<br>  <br>  Only Do This If You Like Him. If You Dont Then Why Does It Matter If He Likes You Or Not?|`|UZ0NBusaaa	From a guy's perspective, I would say that he does like you, or he just thinks that you're 'hot'. But from reading all that I'd say there is a 85% chance he likes you.|`|V0Fikdcwaa	yeah, in his own way. he likes you. he is probably nervous and all of the signs he is giving off are probably a lot more subtle in his eyes but if he won't initiate any conversations, i would definitely suggest that you initiate it and wants you both get over the initial awkwardness he will probably me more likely to open up and talk more. give it time and if nothing changes, you at least made an effort.|`|a317493e448e686d64d7dcfdf36820b5aa	His sound a little like me when I was in high school yes, he likes you but you do not know how to approach because it is you said he is shy because I had a tendency when I was in high school that when I like someone I would I would admire them coming and going hoping that they would not make eye contact with me to take a true is a shame because I missed out on a lot if you are the aggressive type walk up to or set next to him and strike up a conversation I doubt if you will get an answer right away but if you really like him you will have to put in the work and the time to get them to open up I must warn you once you get him to open up he will form an attachment to you to the point to where he will not want you to be with anyone else or to talk to anyone else or if you he see with someone else he will feel hurt and betrayed even though there is nothing going on make sure that this is the road that you must go up speaking from experience|`|ejM4ufzYaa	well i think he is interested in you but he cant know he likes u unless you have a conversation with him.. just a simple one.. dont ask him if he likes u the first time u talk thats too up front and will scare him away. just start a small conversation about what your drawing or something easy to talk about like that.|`|u5mo0p1jaa	by the way you are describing things, it def seems like he likes you. i think you should talk to him and see if you can get things up on a higher level if you know what i mean ;) i mean what do you have to loose! good luck!|`|h8pTXfHqaa	this guy is madly in love with you.|`|k6o6EHCPaa	OHHHH YESSSSS!|`|an7qtWORaa	It's pretty obvious he likes you. YOu might have to make the first    move.|`|xFFZ0rH7aa	Duh. But do you really want a boy that shy?|`|t4MN8gcMaa	he probably does|`|H9AlDTZOaa	yes he likes you|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	O yes, he does.|`|AA12147036	He's into you there's no doubt about it.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/Hardly-Ever.517517" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/Hardly-Ev...</a>|`|bQJ5bskNaa	"he seems to always turn his whole head around and looks at me"<br>  <br>  I just had that image from the exorcist when I read that...|`|NCA8O5RZaa	YEAH|`|SSJid9dUaa	yeah. it seems to me he does.
q0SenAFsaa	I am thinking one of two things...<br>  <br>  Either he thinks that you want something serious and is just making sure that you remember that he doesn't want that.<br>  <br>  Or he secretly still wants you and is trying to convince himself that he doesn't because it isn't what you want.|`|AA11103763	Sounds like he's freaking out. Make a joke about it -- try to say it first the next couple of time you see him. Or say it at the same time that he does and bust his chops. I'm sure he says pretty much the same thing each time, so you should be able to do it.|`|rex4Qcwuaa	I can see how this is annoying, but on the other hand -- at least he's trying to be honest with you!  Better that than the alternative, right?  I think it means he respects you a lot as a friend and a person, because he's trying to make sure you don't get hurt by any miscommunication -- even though it means he's erring on the side of OVER-communication.<br>  <br>  Why he probably keeps bringing this up is that his buddies all probably warned him that even though you SAY you're fine with not having a relationship, "girls never MEAN that."  Who knows, maybe he even once had a similar situation with another girl, and he ended up breaking her heart without meaning or wanting to.<br>  <br>  (And let's be honest, there are plenty of girls out there who say they don't want a relationship but secretly do, and then the guy they're hooking up with breaks their heart.)<br>  <br>  I think the only thing you can do is keep on keeping it casual.  Eventually he'll get the point that you really mean it when you say you're fine with not being together.

juWJ47hXaa	NO!!!! Now quit wondering!!!|`|dXDroPtfaa	Well she was flirting with you..So think, is she a flirt with A LOT of guys? Or just you? If so, then make your move before it's too late..<br>  :]|`|ulpvEpu9aa	I have to say "Yes" haha. lol shithead? :d<br>  you made me laugh dude but anyways, yes I think she is :)<br>  <br>  check my youtube account please!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/disneystarsfaniste" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/disneystarsf...</a><br>  <br>  enjoy!|`|wF4wiNCraa	don't listen to that shithead above me who said no. she is flirting with you, and yes, you should pursue her.
d0wa1BO2aa	Just tell him you had PMS. That's the truth so what else should you say? Odds are since he's 24 that he's had girlfriends and knows of women's troubles from dealing with women. Don't fret. And just tell your parents the truth too if they ask.|`|Qjo6r0hpaa	He is 24.....you can tell him that you had PMS and he would be like "Oh okay"<br>  He SHOULD be mature enough to know that things happen.|`|xubpe9G5aa	just tell him you had PMS hun, he'll understand.  just say you were embarrassed to tell him about your PMS, but you aren't bulimic.|`|Yh4CXJgdaa	lol,..<br>  just be honest.|`|zn9r899gaa	Well, I'm not a girl, but I think you should just talk to your brother about it. You don't have to tell him about your PMS. Just relax and tell him that you were sick. You've done nothing wrong. If that doesn't work, then tell your parents about what happened.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	I would tell him so he will understand. I don't know why your freaking if your NOT bulimic.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	OH for gods sake, grow up.  Tell him you had PMS your brother is a man now and he will understand.  Besides why are you so worried unless there is really something to worry about.  So he tells your parents, if you are not bulimic then you have nothing to worry about now do you? Just say, I don't have an eating disorder, it is just PMS and I'll feel better soon.  <br>  Red

It takes time to take care of one another and to create the kind of desire that can last the tides of time. Everything goes in cycles though.....don't give up just because you are in a down slope. If you want Hot and Heavy then be sure your partner does too or it could have just been the beginning wonder of lust that sparked abnormal actions to get or keep your attention. Little things go a long way.....a note, a gift (special and super personal, but not expensive), just knowing that you want him/her and can not wait until your next meeting can build a new sort of anticipation. =) Keep trying|`|9cZdJXSJaa	Hi, its sad to hear the part about "I NEED YOU NOW kind of sex" Many may disagree with me but sex IS an important part of the relationship. It is the time when both are really together , body and soul. That's just my layman's opinion like everyone else here. I think professional advice at <a href="http://affiliates.answerstolove.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=112" rel="nofollow">http://affiliates.answerstolove.com/idev...</a> seems to be more appropriate. They have forums for you to join in and its free anyway.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	i think you should spice up ur sex life or even love life..<br>  nothing turns a guy on more hwen u step out of the same old thing..<br>  romance is key too. if you guys just "get it on" with nothin to start it up its not as sexy... step out of ur way to lead him up to it all..<br>  like cosmo says: even walkin around in cute langerie when he comes home can make him want you so much more aaha<br>  hope it helps :)
itLS5Ualaa	well if he fingered you he likes you. if he punches you well guys don't punch girls unless there gay. and if you haven't seen him in like 4 months he probably doesn't like you anymore and if you are realllyy good looking then this brings me to my first conclusion of asumeing he is gay.|`|KW77oNWraa	I don't know don't feel to heartbroken if he doesn't:X|`|NqK4vgVPaa	honey please be careful that you don't become too close to someone who will drop you on your face. i don't want you falling to hard because sometimes it's hard to get back up.....best of wishes....<3|`|0Y5W7nTSaa	Don't try to look really good. You want him to notice, "Oh, she's just wearing a t-shirt." You want him chasing after you because when you stop running around it will be like the grand finale. I wouldn't run for long r he will just give up and move on. He does probably like you.|`|TodNRYSlaa	I've seen this exact question on here about 4586894397017 times.|`|kfquQqZsaa	yesss definitely a keeper. right on.|`|AXj4OnZBaa	uh it will probably be that he will want to finger you more.|`|7CCPhDBMaa	if he wont give u his number, yet wants to touch u like that, i'd say he's using you. i'd be wary of a guy thats sposed to be single if he wont give u his number. dont let him take advantage again, be strong and say no. he does like u obviously, but not in a way thats healthy for u. if he really likes u. let him do the running after u, dont contcat hom or worry, if he wants to , then he will. find sumone who isn't weird about numbers|`|2kpZzg93aa	Definately, I think he likes you. But if you guys really like each other and yall start going out, don't let your relationship turn into a sexual relationship meaning that your relationship is based on sex. But other than that, I really think he likes you. Good luck girl!
oKExTm8paa	I think you are envisioning problems that you might not even encounter with her. If she lives out of town, your contact with her will be limited.<br>  <br>  Also, your cell phone should let you know when she calls and you just don't answer.<br>  <br>  What is your family's suggestion about this situation? Talk with them about it. If your family is supportive, they will advise you.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about things before they happen. You'll just get yourself upset. Think positive thoughts.|`|EvIWKqpDaa	Its better that she finds out ASAP. Yes she may freak, but there is a strong possibility if you wait that she may freak out even more because this was kept from you. Its better to let her know so she can get used to the idea rather then wait until the last minute.

rHxSx4eCaa	There are so many things to be addressed here. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't be feeling guilty for "ditching her." You did what was best for you -- which is always the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  "Don't feel guilty" is easier said than done. It is always helpful to journalize feelings, but I would not recommend attempting to befriend this girl again.<br>  <br>  I would not worry about her alienating your from people. I had the same thing happen to me while I was in school. In the long run, it taught me a lot about human nature and myself. If these people don't want to be your friend just because this girl says not to, then you don't want to be their friend.<br>  <br>  As for being scared, what I recommend (and what I did when this happened to me) is going to the police and filing a report. They will take an incident report, when I did this it turned out the girl already had a Probation Officer so she left me alone. However, doing this will make the aggressor realize the severity of what they have been doing.<br>  <br>  I would, also, report her behavior (anonymously, if you want to) to the school administration, principal, etc. They take threats very seriously after all the incidents of school violence that have recently been in the media, such as Columbine. <br>  <br>  Last bit of advice: elementary school and high school suck. Don't worry about what these children think as they are a really tiny sampling of a very small portion of the world. When you get to college you can make friends and meet people that are of a much higher caliber.<br>  <br>  You are on the right road focusing on your studying and staying on the straight-and-narrow. Keep it up! Most people end up making mistakes while they are young that impact the rest of their lives; if you keep your eyes on the prize, you should be able to avoid that and be much more fulfilled with the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  <br>  Don't listen to the poster who said to fight, that's not a good way to go and could lead to further problems for you.|`|CM61dGawaa	fight her
n4nOgLToaa	If I was the girl and I knew you enough, I would want the guy to ask me out on a group date. That way there isn't any pressure and you can all just relax and enjoy each others company. Maybe you can ask her to the movies or to go bowling. Something simple and fun.<br>  <br>  best of luck :)|`|3OBJlaTJaa	be like hey wanna go to a movie with me this weekend???Be confident it helps. otherwise u look like a dead beat and a girl hates dead beats|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	ask :)|`|3034584dbe4ac5b4972b9bff2af30d0aaa	Well, if you're friends with her first, then it should be easy to ask her to the movies or something.

Confidence is key|`|05f47FFRaa	hey sxy lady wanna go movies with me?
EvIWKqpDaa	I'd wait until you are an adult before you attempt to find him. Otherwise you mother may try to stop you in your quest.

zJBbEt6Maa	You sound like you're smart for your age but to be honest when you're in middle school relationships don't really mean jack. Though if you still want to go after this boy I suggest you just let him know you want to talk and when you get that opprotunity tell him how you feel. Another things with young boys they only see what's on the outside so if you're a good looking girl chances are he will say yes though if not he will most likely try an keep you at arms length. I wish you the best of luck no matter what happens. OH and remember you are way to young to start having sex so don't.|`|YRB0jIRraa	why would you WANT to fight for his attention, he should be fighting for yours!! I'd just ignore him and see if he comes good...he might take more interest in you and if he doesn't well who cares about him.
8f7484cd58d5ae1f35f8ec33cbe9d727aa	Dear Adonis,<br>  <br>  You obviously have a good opinion of yourself.  Good for you, just don't allow it to run out of control.  If you convince yourself that you are bringing more to the relationship than she, you are doomed to failure.<br>  <br>  First, more than love, a marriage needs mutual respect.  If you cannot honor your wife as you do yourself, your marriage will not succeed.<br>  <br>  Second, learn her language.  Misunderstanding one another can kill a marriage.  Learn to communicate in her language and you will understand how hard things will be for her, coming to your country, learning a new language and customs.<br>  <br>  Third, good luck.  All marriages are unique.  With the proper preparation, you may very well succeed.  <br>  <br>  Oh, I agree with your quote about sex before marriage.  Sex causes people to think they are in love, even when they are not... for a while.  Sex was meant for a husband and wife, not for casual encounters.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I suppose so. It's like starving to death. If all you have is a stale cracker<br>  that cracker tastes good.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	sounds to me like you are rigid and want to control everything in your life down to the minutest detail.

Some divorce, some just run away. You think you are doing a good thing, but the woman you choose will never really love you. Plus, the moment you get her, she could just leave, because there is no bond of love of commitment, just money.|`|djUMvICoaa	Consider this, I would rather live with someone who I truly loved and in poverty, not far from that anyway, than an unknown with lots of money.  You can throw all the stats around that you want, but if a woman doesn't feel fulfilled in her marriage, or disconnected what are you going to do..  Do you realize that in most cases where there was a cheating spouse and they end up in divorce and he with the other woman who thought she wanted him still doesn't seem to work out, that now someone feels trapped?  Some marriages survive but that doesn't prove that the love survived, they were just tool lazy to file the papers or too convenient to stay where they were.  All the stats you have have never mentioned love in them.     Why not?  Isn't that what you are suppose to base your marriage on , not stats?  good luck, you might need it|`|6tcXKcBgaa	I think not. Personally I need to feel that chemistry with someone. Arranged marriages only last longer because they would be looked down upon if they divorced. If you want to help those women try a different approach. Charity, groups, making people aware of their lifestyles ect.
ocps5AAQaa	boy are really really gay. you have to tell them exactly what you want and whats going on.
rex4Qcwuaa	If you really love him and there's nothing else wrong with your relationship other than this change of plans, stick it out.  After all, his plans already changed once, and they could again -- and so could yours!  <br>  <br>  You never know what the future could bring, and if you leave him just to avoid getting hurt, you might always wonder what could have been.  Better to stick with it and figure out for sure that it wouldn't work -- and have the potential for a great, long-lasting relationship -- than to run now just to avoid getting hurt.<br>  <br>  Even if you do end up getting hurt, you'll get over it.

Unless he was just trying to be nice. I think he wants to be your friend and still talk to you.
qaaiZovWaa	Honey, just let him go. The best thing to do is stop texting him. At this point he continues to answer you because he wants to keep you wanting him. If you fail to text him for a few days, he may realize what he really wants--if he wants anything.  If he doesn't seem bothered by the fact that you aren't texting him then he probably doesn't care. Forget about whats best for him think about what is best for you!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Friends with benefits means he wants to use you for a sex toy hon.You STILL want to be with a total selfish self centered jerk like that?<br>  You said he talks  to you like he doesn't love you but says he does love you.Actions speak louder than words.He can say he loves you as he treats you like trash and uses you for sex, then goes to bed with some other chick and spends all his time and money on her.<br>  Getting the picture yet?That is not even liking you as a friend hon.<br>  Hurt heal and move on from this loser.|`|2gyV8qLGaa	just be a friend of benefit<br>  fixed

It should come naturally and spontaneously.|`|LC8NOZR6aa	Where ever I decide to put my hands, and depending on my relationship with the guy.

It depends on the guy, too.
Pl4MNdxOaa	oh my goodness. im fifteen to and a freshman girl. i have never had a boyfriend or made out with a guy. ive kissed guys before but whatever. i have veryyy high expectations and when guys ask me out and they dont come close to those expectations i say no. obviously no one has met those expectations. ive been asked out many times. my friends are all so experienced and while they talk i just pretend to know what they are talking about not from experience but from knowledge. alot of girls arent that easy. some MIGHT just make out at a party and not expect a relationship. girls are fragile and most deserve to be treated like a porcelain doll.i think you should wait until you find that special girl and start off slow. take your time. the girls will respect you more for it. when shes ready she will probably make the first move.<br>  <br>  good luck and have fun with your freshman year.<br>  xoxo delaney|`|mgdkr6hvaa	well i've never made out with a girl before(but then again i'm a girl and i'm not a lesbian so that makes sense.<br>  <br>  but no i haven't made out with a guy before, i'm 16 and i'm just starting to date.  <br>  <br>  I think it's cute that you haven't made out with anyone before and plenty other people your age haven't either. Don't be ashamed. <br>  <br>  Just find a girl that doesn't have anyone and go next to her. Then just start talking to her.  If she wants to make out then you'll know.<br>  Don't worry good luck.|`|KKeLsvyGaa	Don't be like everyone else. I'm actually glad that your one person who doesn't think it's good to hook-up (because it's not!) <br>  <br>  So what if your friends do that? So that means you have to do it too? No! Be your own person, and don't worry about what everyone else is doing. I think hooking up is pathetic and just disrespectful. Why do you feel like you HAVE to do this? If you think it's pathetic, then don't do it.|`|AA10342048	answer to the second question: you dont. Virginity is attractive, trust me. I am also a freshman girl, and i have had guy friends tell me that they arent virgins anymore and really i dont find that appealing or attractive in any way.

You shouldnt be having sex just to say that you did... trust me on this one =)|`|Oi9IG07Waa	Girls hook up with guys when they are drunk..its usually just a drunk mistake...do u really want your first kiss to be a drunken mistake?

tCiVuFK9aa	I really didn't give them much thought.  I figured they were setting themselves apart from everyone so let them.  The rest of us just ignored them.  You just have to find a group of friends that have the same interests that you do and hang with them.  Forget about the others.  Just take care of yourself and be the best you can be and let the others worry about themselves. I can tell you that the snobs aren't really the most popular kids in school.  It's the friendly kids that are the most popular.<br>  Red
zJBbEt6Maa	Good hygiene is important I think.<br>  <br>  Picking up some nice new threads is never a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Picking up some kind of dating book and studying it isn't a bad idea either. But I mean an actual dating book not like the Kama Sutra or something.<br>  <br>  As far as having the courage to flirt and/or ask this girl out. Well every guy has this problem I suppose you just gotta take the jump and hope you don't land on your neck.
Mee76uvPaa	Look into your heart (heres my corny answer lol) and ask yourself if you could marry him if he proposed.If yes, then stay with him, if no then try to find out more about the other guy. Don't dump your current bf, but try to get to know more about the other one, just to see if you would like him better.|`|Nngdk0izaa	You could just be a friend with your best friend's brother. I mean, if this guy you are going out with is the best bf ever, then it might be different when you tell him you don't really like him that much like you like your best friend's brother. Just my advice.|`|Pybx037Taa	Well you will know who you should be with and it might take time to
m389Isf0aa	Try talking to her, see how her body language is.  If she seems into the conversation then im sure it means she is into you to or interested.

That's what a girl exactly doesn't like. Just talk to her like any other normal person and try to get her into you. But don't make it obvious like making up stories. That's what I and a lot of other girls absolutely hate. Talk to her like you do your friends and don;t be embaressed and if she never asks you out then ask her. Girls are afraid of rejection and that usually stops them from asking out guys. You can tell that she like you if she flirts back at you but not in like "I'm gonna kill you" way.|`|ocxpgBH8aa	Compliment her, maybe tease her a little to break the ice (but nothing too mean or else your turn her off from the get go).  Find something the two of you have in common.  You take the same classes right?  Start talking about your latest homework assignment, or that teacher that you both can't stand, anything to get a conversation started, to find common ground, and establish common interests.

If you are going to be bothered by her IQ, not so good looks, or weirdness, don't go out with her. Personally, I think you are trying to get attention by talking about how many girls have a crush on you.  I think they are the dumb ones for liking you so much, as you do seem to be very shallow. You seem to only want a girl who is hot, super smart, and NOT weird. Dude, that sounds like a pretty boring girl to me!|`|1UQ2pzYvaa	yes you are shallow... and you won't find someone who is perfect so stop it now or get ready to be alone forever.|`|VygBNA0Waa	yes unless u want  to be alone and no sex for the rest of your life|`|xADIsKnVaa	Not shallow at all. Unfortunately most men and women fall within those categories. You sound like an attractive and reasonable guy so I would say give the girls a chance if you think they could end up being a friend and maybe something more will develop. If it doesn't, at least you open-minded enough to check it out.|`|AA11843514	They can't all be that bad.  Maybe you have an issue of how you evaluate girls.  Sometimes things aren't as bad as you assume.  Take some of them out; you might find out something different.|`|AA12160073	They asked you for a DATE, not marriage, for God's sake!

Do something different, like maybe orchids-exotic, but not too pricey.  It doesn't have to be expensive. Maybe devote a whole night to doing things she likes to do.  Go see that sappy chick flick she's been dying to see. The important thing is that she knows you are thinking of her, and that you are willing to something that makes her happy.  If she knows this, she'll be ready to do the same for her.|`|sMV7ezoHaa	Try to get her a nice gift.

Do you actually see each other after school? Do you go out together like to a movie, the park, or a mall? Or, is it just a "school boyfriend" where you just see him there and maybe talk on the phone? I think it is fine as long as you don't get too involved which means no you aren't in love so don't write notes saying you are and seriously no intimate relationship.|`|iWB8y1CGaa	As long as you remember that you are just 13, and should keep it innocent right now...then it's fine.

t4DP30r6aa	No it's not that big of a deal. People make out all the time when they are drunk. She didn't seem to mind it at the time. Besides what's done is done.. it's been a year and half. You need to let it go. Definitely consider to stop drinking because if this bothers you this much, I guarantee you that you will do allot more embarrassing, shameful things while you are trashed!|`|WJjr2E0haa	I think that there is nothing wrong with you. Yes, she had a chance to say stop or even have one of her friends tell you to stop. Dude, I am a woman and I know how we talk with our girlfriends......If this girl said anything to her friends it was because she was put on the spot and didn't want to sound like she wanted it or maybe she didn't say anything and this other girl that said that to you saw it and maybe she is just a b****. <br>  <br>  It was only a kiss and a touch, if she thought you "assaulted" her then you would have been sitting with the cops that night. Now, go have a drink and remind yourself that you are not a sexual Predator and nothing happened that night other than a kiss.|`|3a74f8e968179db88a366eba81b6d2e0aa	A YEAR AND A HALF!?  Dude, you're overthinking and obsessing about this way too much.  The girl?  She's probably forgotten all about it by now.  I'd be surprised if a 21-year-old had never even been kissed.<br>  <br>  Yeah, OK, it could be construed as sexual assault, but only if she told you to stop and you didn't.  She's forgotten about it; you should do the same.  But if you go to a bar, you don't need to get drunk.  You can see what might happen, and this is one of those effects of alcohol that wouldn't just wear off.|`|AA10778911	maybe you should just try|`|jQ2K7y9Haa	Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)<br>  She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,|`|vR4k5iVCaa	this is a very deep situation and being that it has affected you so seriously i don't think anyone should really answer your questions. not to be mean or anything but they do have some people who basks in other peoples misery and i wouldn't want you to take anything that someone sias negatively  bad. maybe you made a mistake. maybe you didn't. you'll never know. as long as you don't go around kissing girls you don't know all the time then just move on with your life baby. your probably making a bigger issue out of something she doesn't even remember. and the other girl said something about the kiss. if it was that serious she would have said something about your hands down her pants. that's my opinion but not an answer

kNT7fzY7aa	It seems that you are a giving person, which is what all of us that want a great relationship must learn to do. It seems to me that you've given and he has taken and taken. So this has left you feeling as if you are the only one in your relationship that cares whether you have a happy marriage or not. That can be a lonely place to be.<br>  <br>  It would seem to me that he would have made a few changes concerning your relationship after you left him the first time. That should have been his wake-up call. You must do this: Set him down and get his undivided attention, look him straight in the eyes and tell him exactly how YOU feel.<br>  <br>  You must start your sentences off with, "I feel hurt when I gave you an anniversary present and got nothing in return", etc, etc. "It saddens me to feel that our relationship has withered, I'd like to revive it if you are willing to work on it just as hard as me", "What do you think about this?" <br>  <br>  And my dear if you have tried this and you've gone to counseling and he is still not willing to give back to you in return for the love and kindness that you've made sure to have shown. Then you must leave in order to obtain comfort somewhere else.<br>  <br>  But I would strongly urge you to not cheat on him as it will only cause you more sorrow. #1 it's just plain wrong. #2 If he finds out and can show proof in court that you were the unfaithful one, he might be able to take your kids from you. <br>  <br>  Sorry your going through this, hope you can make things better in your life. You no there's an old saying. "Nothing changes until you change." Good luck...|`|urXqpn3haa	wow  hit me and we can chat you know|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	Why complicate things more by getting a man on the side. It's just going to make matters worse. Go to the YWCA or another women's shelter for advice. They have transitional housing, job assistance and attorneys available. Don't waste your life away like this. He's not worth it. If you stay, your kids will end up thinking it's ok to let others disrespect them and they will end up growing up with major psychological issues. You CAN make it on your own!!!! You just need to decide what's more important.....things or love and happiness. Things come and go. GET OUT. THINGS WILL BE BETTER!|`|URZNtrxsaa	Hi Kathy,<br>  <br>  It sounds like in your heart and in your mind, you have already made a very difficult decision and wish validation. A good friend of mine shortly before he died said that" Life is not a dress rehearsal" and that we should live, love and enjoy every moment we are on this planet. You have already given as much to this relationship as any two people I know, and have tried to make things work. Unfortunately, some people will live an entire life time and just never get it. This sounds very much like your current husband.<br>  <br>  My one very strong recommendation to you would be NOT to take a lover before you leave him and to show him the door. A lover or lovers will complicate your life and that of your children when your husband finds out. He will make you look like the villain to them instead of the warm loving person and mother you are. <br>  <br>  Good luck as you try to move on with your life....|`|p9gOEkSPaa	sounds like a pisces guy. i think you should talk to him about all of these problems. atleast try to work this out. maybe you'll get to see the side of him that YOU SAW when you first met him. its never good to have anything on the side so it'd be so much better if you just get a divorce first and then find a guy that you like.|`|vQsrGe0caa	I don't really know what to say but this is my opinion. You are choosing to stay because of money, because you don't think you can be on your own...does this even sound right to you? You would rather be unhappy, in an unhappy marriage, with probably un happy children that see everything because its convenient for you?  There are many single moms out there that do what they have to.  They go leave with their moms until they can get enough money saved up. Yes it sucks at first but it won't be like that for long. Date.... find a man worthy of you, there are many out there. You need to do something for you and your children.  Your husband has to pay child support and if he does anything illegal  you can report him. Easy and simple.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	about the gas money and hair appointments - get a job!!! If you have one get a better one.<br>  <br>  who cares about jewelry?<br>  <br>  why would you want to have a regular sex life with someone who<br>  apparently grosses you out?<br>  <br>  Buy him some nice clothes and cologne and he'll probably wear them...<br>  <br>  Make him an appointment at the salon...|`|fRIEHBJOaa	he sounds really weird. i say this because he doesnt want his parents knowing what he does for a living and sends mail to P.O. boxes ( i really hope you have a key to this box, because if not, something is a brewin').<br>  <br>  i would never recommend cheating. but i'm also not going to tell you NOT to cheat. you do what you want to do. cheating is the easy way cause you dont have to actually make a life altering decision. easy is not always best. and cheating is a short term solution.<br>  <br>  but what i would do:  i would tell him you're VERY unahppy.  IF he attends marriage counseling. give it a go at it.  if he does NOT attend counsleing, then THAT'S IT. start to talking to lawyers ASAP. i never recomeend mentioning divorce, unless you started the process, cause shady men take money switch accounts and etc. and since your husband is so freaking "private" as it is, i wouldn't trust him.  so you decide you're getting and divorce and go forth with it.<br>  <br>  then, get the children into cousneling to cope. at least they'll go.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well if a woman is FED UP with the other ones doing then it then it is time to LEAVE|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Well, you have many preconceived ideas about what a marriage should be like. That is really at the core of your difficulties. Did you ever consider that your husband does not share your ideas?

wUIJSSJlaa	I dont think you have to be in love with someone to have sex with them.  As long as its not a different girl/boy every night then I think it's ok.  Really, whats so bad about it?

PrKFlCe0aa	Sounds to me like the both of you were being immature. You did invite her somewhere, and that was very nice of you. <br>  And in an ideal world, she should have invited you to see the Jonas Brothers. <br>  BUT, this is life, and people are rude more often than not, and you could have chose to react better. She made the decision to invite someone else. That sucks for you for sure, but it isn't up to you, even if you were nice. <br>  I believe that if you get what you deserve, in most cases. <br>  Have you ever heard of Karma.<br>  I'm Christian, but am a firm believer in that. <br>  What goes around, comes around.<br>  She'll get what she deserves, and so will you. You just do the best you can to mind your manners and respect all you can.|`|WQ8wi2Gkaa	Not sure that this is any help, but i think you were both wrong. I know it hurts to feel like her second choice but you can't expect her to always hang out with just you. She probably missed her friend when she was in india and a concert is a great way for them to reconnect. Your friend is definitely overreacting. She should have been more understanding and maybe apologetic when you confronted her about the concert. She also shouldn't have ignored you for so long, but maybe when she asked you to go skating she wanted to patch things up? This seems like the whole thing upset you both and now that some time has passed, i think you should try to talk to her. Try going out to lunch, just the two of you or ask her to come over to talk.|`|XK0sOxbzaa	sorry, but sooooooo you. u kept bugging her when she didn't want to talk and she tried to make up with you but didn't want to show that she completely forgave you yet. sorry,she is not completely right, but alot more right then you based on the info. sry sry sry sry.|`|ryiCUZpRaa	Both of you were wrong.

K2a3XFlFaa	no i wouldnt'. but make this decision together. becuase what if he got you a gift and you didnt get him one, that would suck. so just say "hey how bout no gifts or anything for our one month thats a bit excessive lets just go see a movie or go out to dinner to celebrate"
Nngdk0izaa	Well, the movies or the mall is a start. I like going to the mall because of all the different stores. If your friends like going to the movies or see something you and all your friends would like to watch, then that would be a great way to begin your social life. It takes time (and, as they say, patience) to keep your social life going after so many years, but you would enjoy your time and reward yourself afterwards.|`|Pelf56DHaa	SMOKE POT!<br>  <br>  No I'm kidding please don't.<br>  Try hanging out at the mall or going to the movies.|`|89lAhznQaa	have dinner together, play sports or video games, do some activies|`|OgV94ozgaa	moviess!!!
J7Cque7waa	Okay, common mistake with girls.  Usually at younger ages because older women do not ask this question.  Anyway, when you ask a guy who he likes, he will most likely not tell you.  Either he doesn't trust you, it's one of your friends, or it's you.  Most guys won't ruin the chances of being able to get with her.  As in highschool people get awkward with that stuff. <br>  <br>  If there is no conversation, well it's hard to keep texting as the person doesn't know what to say.  That means you have to bring up some random topic.|`|IVPZkJnvaa	SOunds like it.<br>  Try asking him out.<br>  good luck|`|YrbRQi6Laa	This dude might be interested in you but he is more interested in other girls. This dude likes talking to you but doesn't want you to be his girlfriend. There could be another reason a reason that happens more to guys than girls, he might like you but he doesn't want to get embarrassed by his friends. To make him like you you have to give him what he likes but yet again not even your mom and dad are worth giving everything they want. This is this guys loss because you sound like a good girl and if the only reason he says no than get another guy i bet even if this guy eventually said yes he wouldn't treat you that well and your worth it.|`|RUL7xdHHaa	just be yourself and flirt with him but dont go over board with flirting because if you do then he will think that you come off to strong|`|0ekYnZZaaa	just ask him out|`|ypGtH8Rhaa	It is physically impossible to make someone like you.<br>  <br>  as for the rest don't be afraid to show a few feelings I guess you could say, flirt back with him if you want. like start before he does.<br>  <br>  To start conversations start with broad things first, maybe something that might interest you both or can lead on to a debate just not like an angry one then narrow it down or move on to a different subject. but believe it or not most people quit texting when there's nothing to talk about or no conversation goin', just start throwing topics out there or random questions that are on you mind. and don't worry about embarrassing yourself if your in a public situation it doesn't matter what other people think<br>  <br>  Or you could just ask him out and see how it goes.|`|pLo2LJVjaa	Is he a player?...That could explain all the flirting.<br>  <br>  But if he isnt, then he definately likes you!

Common interests are big though.|`|tu1m1dkoaa	I think he does. <br>  Like when your talking just look at him and be like wow you have pretty eyes. It usually works for me. Then he will like say something back, probably like you have really pretty eyes. Then be like guess who told me that we would look good together. And just stuff like that. Hope that helps. Best answer me and i will you.|`|QL7tYexwaa	from past experience, when you ask who you like, its probably you, he is just to shy to say so. also the best way to start a conversation is inside jokes so take him with some friends and do something fun that everyone will open up to.
cbmkx5Joaa	Have you told him how you feel? If not I'm sure he has no idea, and maybe he is trying to make you jealous because he wants to be with you too (boys are strange sometimes). If he says something about not wanting to be with you or not feeling the same then I suggest taking a break from talking to him until you are over him. This will stop you from getting hurt by him talking about his girlfriend everyday and will also help you to get over him.|`|lerqDtQ9aa	Maybe you should just tell him how it makes you feel when he talks about his new girlfriend and that you still have feelings for him.

AA10156073	A relationship means being there for the other person, even when they aren't doing well.  I don't know enough about your relationship to say if you did the right thing or not, but by the description you gave, he sounded like he treated you well and you liked him.  So if your main reason for breaking up with him was that he was going through a bad period, yes, you made a mistake in breaking up with him.  If there were major conflicts between your two personalities, then it was the right thing.  You are obviously young, so don't worry too much about it, he was unlikely to be "the one."  Just remember for the future that no relationship is perfect, and that you have to find a way to work around problems as a couple.  If you can't do that, you won't have any luck in your future relationships.|`|mFZeEm9paa	I think that you made the right choice. I have a similar situation that I am in right now, where my bf treats me like I am his everything, but has a temper so explosive he needs to seek help.

I feel like I held on for so long trying to make things right, but now it just isn't even worth fighting over anymore. You were smart to let him go.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Yes you did the right thing.Too bad you didn't do it before you gave him your virginity though.<br>  He has an anger problem and needs to do something about it as well as his depression.You and no girl is  the cure for his problem.<br>  Can you imagine living with him having kids and him behaving like this, but 10 times worse?<br>  Next time get to know a guy well enough to marry him BEFORE sex then marry him before sex.It takes a LOT longer to get to know someone well enough to know you'd like to spend the rest of your life with them, than it does to drop your panties and have sex hon.<br>  Now what if you had gotten pregnant?<br>  It is time to use your head here g/f.

( it makes a girl feel like special)<br>  4. stay in contact and let the relationship grow!<br>  5. IF u like her as more than a friend say hey __________ i like you , do you like me?<br>  6. if she says no then get over her like that and just be friends ( dnt make her feel awkward!<br>  7. if she say yes ask her out!<br>  GOOD LUCK <br>  XOXO<br>  TAY BAYBAY|`|ch4rssvlaa	okay yea pretty girls are intimidating but you know nothing will get better if u dont say anything<br>  <br>  what if she wants to talk 2 u but she might feel awkward around u as well so all u really need to do is subtly ask her, hey can i work with you, like you sed. <br>  <br>  the worst thing that could happen is u go back to doing the same thing u've been doing so why not talk to her<br>  <br>  after she gets more comfortable with u agen, maybe she'll start talking to u some days and it will be a mutual exchange of conversation <br>  <br>  but i dont think its personal because maybe she jus matured a little more or simply changed, it doesnt mean she doesnt like u anymore, she might think the same of u so really, dont worry about it........and talk to the girl!!|`|VMUwtGCuaa	you like her romantically and you are a friend to her.|`|5jZdHPMwaa	Don't be afraid or nervous to talk to her!<br>  Be confident.<br>  I know it's hard to just bulk up some confidence asap, but girls don't want to talk to or work with guys who are afraid to speak to them.<br>  Doesn't matter the reason behind why you're afraid.<br>  She doesn't want to hear it until you two are possibly dating for a while, then it's a cute thing to hear. And it'll make her smile. That's what happened with me ;)<br>  But just go up to her and say 'hey'.<br>  You don't even have to ask to work with her right then and there.<br>  Just start with a hello when you enter class, or a smile when in the hallways. Something she'll NOTICE, cause she'll think about it throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps
6ulA6MVVaa	lol personally (im 15)  lvoe being kissed on the first date (at like the middle of end not at the beginning ) and IM a preppy girl lol she prolly thinks the saem wayyy i do......just dont freak her out......i would start with a slow  kiss jsut brush her lips, then put your tip of ur tongue on her lips, and if she opens up, she wants more, if nawt, leave it at that. good luck! i hope this helps! if u have any more questions or just awanna chat email me at neon_rainbow99@yahoo.com <3 ;)|`|c5zT8mv7aa	At the end of your date move forward to kiss her cheek and she may surprise you and kiss you on the lips.  Girls like to kiss whether it's the 1st date or not.|`|3CAM4iceaa	yes... girls love a kiss on the first date,,,, as long as its no longer than 3 seconds on the first date|`|11pKepd4aa	I'd wait till the 3rd date. but still show affection with hugs or something.<br>  Good luck man|`|4bDPhnCKaa	it depend if u want to kiss them|`|oXvOxYy0aa	get to know her first.... then kiss her but in my opinion i dont think that girls like kissing on the first date... i mean its not commiting a crime but i think that if you dont kiss her then it keeps her interested because she may want a second date because your a nice guy|`|3UVPe2xraa	It really depends on the girl. Its not like all girls are the same. Some of us like to pace our relationships when others like to rush forwards. According to the information you gave about you two, I think that you should go for it. I think she should be able to handle it...|`|QXJcTOFbaa	well you wouldnt kiss her until the end of the night. but be a gentleman throughout the whole thing. and if the chemistry feels right and if you know shes having a good time. then at the end maybe just keep looking her in the eyes and maybe lean in alittle and see if she leans and if she does then thats the okay to kiss her but if she doesnt just make the lean in a smooth hug. lol.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AXj4OnZBaa	take her out, and see how the date goes! if you can feel that she's into you, go for it, but pleeease not sloppy wet ones. if you're not really sure, just wait until you two go out again, and if she says yes, kiss her then.|`|BQjw14d1aa	If you think the date has done really well and you can tell she's had a great time too. Go for the kiss. Just don't be pushy. :]|`|Km2nzm3saa	I liked kissing on the first date.
AA11312653	You invite people who are a part of your family circle or a part of your social circle. Regarding your co-workers, you may have come to know some of them well and have grown fond of them but are they a part of your social circle? Do you include them in activities with non-work friends? It's nice to bring in a cake or otherwise some sort of celebration with co-workers, but unless they are part of your circle of friends then they are professional colleagues and inviting professional connections to social events is often seen as either being a social climber or fishing for gifts. Ditto for the people at church.<br>  <br>  Couples in long term exclusive relationships should be invited as a couple, but absolutely you need not allow singles to bring a date. The Wedding Industry will advise you otherwise, but they are LYING. (Don't take my word for it, check with Miss Manners.) Every person should be invited by name -- no "&family" or "&guest" invitations. <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, you don't invite everybody you know, you invite family, and you invite those members of your social circle whom you feel close to and care about. <br>  <br>  PS The Wedding Industy also lies about children. You may invite your favorite nephew without any obligation to also invite every child of every guest. <br>  Congrats & best wishes.|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	You need to realize that only about half of the people you invite are actually going to show up. At least that's how it has been with a lot of the weddings I have gone to or helped out with.<br>  I wouldn't invite people you don't associate with outside of your work or your church. Have you asked them if they wanted to go? If so, you need to invite them since you already asked. If you haven't asked, don't feel bad for not inviting them.|`|emKXU1QFaa	With work you should just invite the ones you associate with outside of work. The others really won't want to go anyway but make sure they know you are having a small wedding (sometimes you do get that one person who gripes which is why you let them know).  <br>  <br>  As for your church members that will be more delicate you may need your parents help letting some of them know invitations were limited to family and a few close friends.  I'm guessing that they know your parents so well and watched you grow up some feel entitled to attend.  Again just choose the ones you are the closest to.  If anyone give you flack be very nice and let them know you wished there had been more room to invite others but between your list and your fiances not everyone could get invited.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulation!|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	I dont know if this would help, but we are inviting friends (the ones we couldn't invite) to the ceremony, and inviting them back later after the dinner to the reception, no one is upset about this, they all understand that it cost a lot of money, and family comes first, and they aren't even upset that mutual friends were invited. Could this be an option? That you invite your co-workers to the ceremony? And tell them you or your spouse has a lot of family, and you just couldn't accommodate everyone you would like to have for your reception|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Leave the church family out.  I invited some co-workers and not others, they didn't invite me to their wedding, they didn't get an invite.  I am closer with some than others and some work in my unit so they got invited.  You have to invite the spouses as well, that is just proper.  good luck.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Top priority out of your co-workers and church family should be those you associate with more often outside of work who you feel close to. If you don't associate with someone they shouldn't be upset if they are not invited|`|884v4VhGaa	If you know some co-workers socially and not others then you can invite just the ones you know socially. <br>  <br>  With the church, since it's so small you probably ought to invite everyone. Otherwise you can get away with inviting just the people you are close friends with and see often. (i.e. invite friends rather than church members). One thing you can do is to have cake and punch after the wedding for everyone, and then the proper reception can be elsewhere, and you don't have to invite the church to the reception.
nWCP91q2aa	umm a card would be a nice start then maybe a freindship bracelet or necklace out of string and charms? idk im not that crafty best of luck best answer plz?|`|19ILDxBsaa	well, if shes driving you can get her a custom license plate for the front of her car that has her name on it or something?<br>  <br>  my best friend got me a really cute one with my name in stars i loved it<br>  <br>  my other best friend got a thing piece of wood and covered it in cloth that she got at michaels (or any art supply store) and then decorated it with different pins and hot glued little things on it and then put lots of pictures of us all over it.  it's the cutest thing and goes with my room perfectly.
pVnUhYLQaa	Give yourself an enema. You can buy kits at the drug store.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I'd be glad to send you an IM but i am not at home. Anyway, just use an enema before you have anal sex and don't be embarrassed to ask its ok.|`|jQ2K7y9Haa	My boyfriend has been wanting to try Anal sex and I wouldnt mind it, It's just that I had a really embarrassing experience with it before and Im worried it will happen again. I practiced relaxing the other day and trying it on myself and even though I took a bowel movement there was still a little bit there. How can I prevent this from happening when I am ..with him? Thankyou for your time.|`|3Vmd2KYTaa	If you are really worried about feces then you can give yourself an enema earlier in the day... although if you are close enough to be having anal sex then you should expect that there will be a little grossness involved.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	i think that's normal.  just be yourself.  men know what to expect when then enjoy anal sex.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	hes in ur a-- hole what do u expect tell him to wear a condom|`|YYAmBsvXaa	well even if you go #2 your still going to have some stuff in there. Its your butt. things arent supposed to go in there and come out squeeky clean. Its perfectly normal to have poo on the guys **** hes sticking it in a place where you shed your waiste.

Hope All Ur Wishes Come True :D !!!
zCE0slQ5aa	you, in essence, want that which you cannot have. put yourself around him as much as possible without being obvious. as subtly as you are able, impact upon him how much better you are for him than she is. she is not covering all the bases with him (no pun intended), you can count on that. find out what he doesn't like about her. be the opposite of what he dislikes in her.<br>  <br>  if you like him, show him. take him.<br>  <br>  you think we are free lunches out here? put in the work girl!
8c22fe51ccc4484f5eefe751a90ee0ebaa	well it depends on your ages. How old is older, and how old are you?<br>  <br>  assuming this is 16 to 18 kinda thing, just talk to him and hang around with him.|`|0gOWh0z2aa	Dress a little sexy.  "Accidentally" give him a nice view down your shirt sometime.|`|na8ObA5Haa	depends on how old.... <br>  <br>  <br>  how old is he?<br>  how old are u?|`|AXj4OnZBaa	are you the same girl who's the 13 going for the 23 year old? we've already told you it's sick, and he's sick if he likes you.<br>  <br>  but if you're not, just get talking to him and compliment him and be friendly and get him interested by talking to him.|`|yi5dFO7paa	well how old is older? from what i hear from my friends (i hang out with people in the age range of 17-21 mostly) when 13 year odl girls flirt with them it a little weird.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	again, whats with not saying your age..... bump into him or like the first guy said... let him peak ;P but only a little...|`|ZoPHiy8naa	depending how old he is little flirt like so hows it going and pick up convo isnt hard. Then used little high piched voice to answer him guys like it and squint your eyes alitle not like you cant see but yknow and smile alot|`|3JQrpifHaa	smile ...mayb even touch his shoulder when you walk by and leaz answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuntLUEyCxmTlduLEqd1ku7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304150520AAyQnVC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XUs8eofqaa	If you know him try to talk to him.and if you don't try to start a conversation so he can know more about you.Good Luck!! :)|`|B8DBuH2qaa	have sex.
u5mo0p1jaa	ummm i would have to say he is a playerrrr like most guys. does he have a rep for being a player?? or does he seem like a good guy? but if you guys only started dating saturday and hes already saying hes in love with you, then thats not cool. he is probably trying to hide something by telling you hes in love with you and make you feel like he is a good guy when hes really not. and she stole his phone? b.s. if thats his ex, why is he still talking to her anyway, and is he really dumb enough to let her go through his phone..not cool.|`|0q4quk8raa	Sounds like his phone was took by a friend and they wanted to annoy you or something, i wouldn't worry.<br>  Ask him if you have doubt
08y217Rdaa	Her underwear is occasionally missing.
VVA3nDTtaa	Yea it does.
uTMEWgKfaa	People may be going there to have sex, but not all.<br>  Some just go to enjoy the ending of highschool memories<br>  and to have fun!!<br>  Just be careful and dont drink ;)|`|emppOY6Uaa	well by the way that sounds after the prom the people are going to take their dates to the room and have sex|`|dM4SFti3aa	If you have to ask then your to young to know the answer|`|EsKNS32oaa	After prom the girl and the guy often go somewhere like a hotel room and, to be blunt, have sex.  Or do something sexual with each other.  It's not required, but the guy will certainly appreciate it.
wUIJSSJlaa	aw you sound like a great guy!  Prove them wrong by getting a girlfriend.  and by the way you described yourself and how respectful you are you should definitely be able to find one.|`|Dc1trPN9aa	Having all those friends who are girls will actually help you find girls that like you; if you know how to treat a girl properly, that goes a long way towards impressing her. <br>  <br>  I agree with one of the other answerers - next time someone suggests you're gay just say you would have come out by now if you were.|`|AXj4OnZBaa	Kids your age joke around a LOT about being gay-- even at my age they do, too. if they're really your friends, tell them seriously that you are not gay, that you would have come out by now if you were, and that it genuinely bothers you when they talk about that. if they don't back off, i think you should get some new friends. good luck! :)|`|NzxodTOaaa	gotta wait brother<br>  <br>  i really didnt get the ladies till after high school<br>  <br>  and it never hurts to have lady friends makes you look good<br>  <br>  and if you know your not gay thats all that matters screw your friends
Cb0l4QvKaa	ur to nice, try slapping them around every once in a while
u5mo0p1jaa	i would say he def likes you. he is going out of his way alot just to talk to you, so i would say yes! get it girl!|`|iS94TGdxaa	if hes charming- hes a player- take the truth from another male--<br>  <br>  however-since he is homeschooled he prob doesnt meet alot of girls and may be sincere.|`|7oiBFIguaa	Start by something simple, like at the end of karate say something like "We should hang out sometime outside karate" And if he says yes, then cool, that gives you more time to get to know him and see if he does like you. Just because a guy looks at you doesn't mean he likes you.
NlksZPfTaa	He's just in for fun.<br>  <br>  2 months and a fast mover?<br>  <br>  YEH|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Give him the backside of your hand and tell him to kiss off and leave you alone.|`|753e6fc49255e91b19ebfb5307e9a17aaa	dont fall for it, ignore him!<br>  He doesnt sound stable or safe enough to be in a relationship with, u almost sure u gonna get hurt if u get into a relationship wid him, and i'm sure u dont want to be his rebound. he sounds lik jus a flirt to me.<br>  <br>  its all jus feelings if u giv urself tym u will get ova him and move on, dont waste ur tym and emotions!|`|wphI41wNaa	Well think about it he's a fast mover, Do you only want to date him for a little while? Do you want to have sex with him after a couple days? Cuz that's where it's going to go. Does he like you or your vagina?  Don't be stupid because you think you really like him he dated your friend look what happened if you do your not a good friend at all would you want her to date someone who broke up with you after having sex with them?|`|7wFSTmwfaa	omg. i have the same exact story<br>  <br>  OK! the dude is obviously a player, loser, and jerk. chances r he don't like u he just wanna sleep with u.<br>  u can do so much better. he don't deserve u. that was rude of him to go out with ur friend and it shows he don't care about u or ur feelings<br>  i know it sooo hard to let go, but u can do it. just sit down, take deep breaths, and repeat in ur mind how he hurt u. i ber he's with some other girl<br>  GOOD LUCK! you'll make it through. some guys can be retards, and don't recognize a lady when they see one!|`|OJyBn47daa	Please don't go back with him. My bf just broke up with me yesterday and now he's dating someone else and he 2 is a fast mover. Well w/e you do dont go back to him hes a loser and hes not worth your time dont make the same mistake :)|`|nd5w7v4saa	Dont give him a chance,<br>  he hurt you once.<br>  he seems like a player.|`|WEPtK6ARaa	Well it depends on how your friend would feel if you two dated.<br>  And did he actually like your friend, or was just using her for the 'benefits'?<br>  You should talk to him one day and ask him if he atually likes you,<br>  and why he dated your friend instead of you.
wRHhpanmaa	My husband has a black ceramic ring. My ring is black, and simple ( I didn't want anything fancy) and my husband works with oil and all kinds of other grease and ink and god knows what else. (Air Force) He originally had a black titanium ring, but it started to tarnish and fade. We got him a ceramic ring, and it stayed black. It is easy to wipe off, it is amazing. However, it does knick like porcelain kind of if he hits something the wrong way. so he will have to be careful. Other than that, it is a wonderful ring, that actually stays black and doesnt fade.|`|884v4VhGaa	Yes, the ceramic itself is black. It is not a coating so it will stay black. The problem comes with if it will stay shiny. And yes, you're fine there too. Ceramics are quite tough and are not easy to scratch.
AEJMeADMaa	Man up, lol just kidding. You know just go up to them and talk as friends not every conversation has to be you trying to start a personal relationship.|`|TCpWVW4Raa	Jesus you are picky|`|3i1vAIBFaa	try taking a risk and talking to them. just be confident, even if you have to pretend or fake it.
6RlCp4Jpaa	Well, I would never tell my mom or dad. If you want to, you can just bring it up in a conversation with her, or if she says a guy is cute or something like that then tel her. Or just have your friend "accidentally spill it on the phone" or something. <br>  <br>      Good Luck!!!|`|lK3TXGBOaa	idk ive never told my parents when i have a boyfriend i feel its kind of awkward...but it would be great for them to know because yeah...i think me seeing this guy without my parents permission is not right...|`|z3QsWmzpaa	just say to your mum im seein this guy and hes really nice to me and pick out all the positive things about him <br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|THwVItleaa	I am not gonna tell you that its gonna be easy. If your boyfriend is not a trouble boy, then really there should be no problem on the other hand if he is then, that may be the reason it difficult for you.Simply ask your mother if you can have a talk with her,tell her you need an approval on a boy that should make her feel good that her daughter came to her before keeping it from her|`|XkidpdPWaa	Just purposely get her to catch you two at it. It saves the need for words.
4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	My cousin framed a copy of my wedding invitation.  She actually "quilled" it to decorate it in the colors from my wedding.  Here's a website for quilling:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.quillingbysandrawhite.com/id2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quillingbysandrawhite.com/id2...</a><br>  <br>  Something I've done for my friends is on the wedding day i take a bunch of photos of the ceremony.  Then i print them out before going to the reception, place them in a small album and leave it on the head table.  Most brides (myself included) have to wait a while to get professional photos back, and most pictures you receive from the guests are of the reception.  All my friends liked getting this!|`|CnLL5ENmaa	its expensive...but check out Stephanie London Gown Reflections....she does paintings of wedding gowns. It's crazy.  If you know someone, or are artistic yourself, you can do something like that.  Obviously you'd have to give it to her afterward, but I love the idea!

You need to move on and find another boyfriend that is trustworthy...and then trust him (don't snoop) or you'll lose him.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	He is never going to change. he is just going to be more careful so he won't get caught. If you want to forgive him and take him back then that is your problem. You are not going to stop anything.|`|qYPWKv6Faa	You no longer have trust so the relationship is OVER! You made a decision to stay with someone who cheats on you, he realizes you are not leaving him so he can treat you anyway he chooses to because you are not doing anything bout it, if you really want the problem resolved you either stay in it and stop being so untrusting or you walk away, or he may just get enough of it and walk away.....|`|hLOnQj9maa	well to really find out what he doin just one day follow him and watch whats he is doin and get his phone before you think he is gone delete any number out his phone ok and get your phone and start puting other guys number in your phine and watch how jealous she he gets.....|`|UnK7MqMgaa	get rid of him, he sounds like he is untrustworthy.

XQKccNWtaa	That really sucks. I'm pretty certain they do have grounds to fire you for hitting an employee no matter what he said and how rude. I would have expected a warning or probation of some sort, not an outright firing. It may be he was threatening legal action or something. I don't know the situation.<br>  <br>  I think what is most unfair is that nothing happened to him! Didn't they listen to your side of the story? I think something should have happened to him as well for his attitude and foul language, especially around children. <br>  <br>  It is possible you could ask for you job back if you were to apologize but I don't know that you would want to work there with a jerk like him. I think the petition is a nice gesture though, clearly you are well liked at the rink.

As in she doesn't like kissing you? or she just doesn't get that 'spark'? <br>  <br>  I feel for you, it's a hard situation to be in, i suggest talkng to her about it. Ask her if she thinks it's worth staying together, rather than ending up getting hurt in the long run. <br>  <br>  It's not her fault i guess. Do you 'feel' something when kissing her? <br>  <br>  I'm no wise god of Yahoo Answers lol, and my answer is pretty vague, but talking about it is probably the best solution, she probably feels bummed that she doesn't 'feel' anything yet again. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|1UQ2pzYvaa	she means she's not into you but she doesn't want to hurt your feelings or doesn't have the guts to break up with you so you do it before you get hurt... and tell her you didn't feel anything either just to get back at her.|`|cggkcAC5aa	Talk to her more about it. ask her what you want from the kiss. if she doesnt know how to answer this question, then you should probably break up with her because it will eventually end|`|CzIaAnsraa	It means 1.) you're a bad kisser, or 2.) she lost feeling in her mouth. <br>  <br>  Probably 1.|`|zMJDtFgGaa	She does too much coke and her lips are numb.|`|kpOhopALaa	shes gay!!!|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	what does she want?<br>  see fireworks or stars!?<br>  lay off the movies...lol|`|ypGtH8Rhaa	Dude just go with it, seeing how you've only kiseed like twice that doesnt seem like much time to build an emotinal bond there. Don't break it off or any thing just be prepared for if she does. In other words don't get too attached if you know what im saying (doesn't mean be emotionally numb). <br>  <br>  Other than that just talk to her about it sorta how you have with asking if she thought you guys were better off as friends. Ask her to give it a lil time and see how it goes. But over all dude if it does end let it end on good terms so you can stay friends afterwards.|`|WTgD2nUoaa	this will work TRUST ME!!!!<br>  <br>  1. when you get done kissing her passionately, brush your finger gently on her bottom lip and look in her eyes!<br>  <br>  2.

When you withdraw from kissing her, keep looking her in the eyes and dont say anything even if she says something! Just be very sensual about it.<br>  <br>  You do these things it will definitly work TRUST ME!!!!

Some things girls just can't talk to guys about; what she was upset about might've been one of those things.<br>  My best friend is a guy; there are some things I wouldn't tell him, and I also know there are things he doesn't tell me.  It upsets me a little, but at the same time I understand.<br>  You can feel upset about it, and you could even tell her that.  But don't get mad about her for it; she doesn't have to tell you everything.  Just explain to her.  She still might not tell you, but at least she'll know how you feel and how much you care for her.
jdah4ZA2aa	Wait a bit ... 3 weeks isn't that long.  Fool around, if you must.  But sex changes everything in a relationship.  For one thing, it makes you have to worry about pregnancy and all that.  For another, it can make us think we like someone more than we really do, or, when it doesn't turn out the way we planned it in our head, it can make us doubt our feelings we had for someone.  <br>  <br>  By the way, the main difference between sex and masturbation is the emotional need that it satisfies.  The physical part is easier to take care of on your own, so don't expect having sex to make you feel fulfilled.  With your hormones raging, you're going to want it a lot, regardless of what you're doing.  So don't do it just because you're horny.|`|R2h2u93faa	just, lock him in ur room lol|`|iPEOczYjaa	Look most guys really don't want a girl that is that EASY,  ease up a little and make him work for it a little.

Yyt8ZjU2aa	Hun, your parents really need to back off and let you be. You are turning 18 girl, you are not their little baby anymore. And as painful as it may be for them, they gotta accept that as a part of being a parent. Kids will eventually grow up, and that's just how life is. I know it's hard, but you need to be assertive and tell them straight out your plans about college. After all, it's your life we're talking about, not theirs. They already got to live their lives, now it's time for you to live yours. They can't dictate your life.. It might sound harsh, but it's the reality. You need to break it to them sooner or later. They can't just go on thinking you're their little baby for the rest of their lives. If you don't confront them now, things are guaranteed to only get worse. The next thing you know, they're gonna be naming your kids! lol<br>  <br>  Just sit them down, and tell them you have decided that this is the best choice for YOU. You can still visit them on the weekends and on holidays. Let them know that. It's not like you're disappearing from their lives forever. I think that if you sit them down and talk to them calmly, they will start to understand and be more agreeable. Good luck!|`|E6tkzPsbaa	Follow your heart, not theirs. You don't want to be stuck at a college you dislike for the next 4 years. Tell them you love them and care about them, but this is your decision and they can't make it for you.

Good luck!|`|u5mo0p1jaa	i think you should go to the college you want to go to, its your life! sure your parents may be mad for awhile but they love you and they will forgive you and get over it. but if you choose the wrong college, thats a long time you have to be miserable, and what you do in college affects the rest of your life. do what is best for you. hope this helped|`|BdJLiv7Laa	You sound like every kid in Kennesaw GA.

n1vhO7Htaa	Okay first problem.. you say u LOVE this woman... who u are NOT with. That is a BIG issue! You can't just proclaim your love to her! that's a big turn off for women. Most women LOVE what they can't have. <br>  <br>  My best advice to you would be to give her SPACE. Don't be clingy or offer to do stuff for her or buy her stuff or anything... she might go out with u but for the wrong reasons... to use you. <br>  <br>  Don't act interested in her for a little while at least and then casually invite her to go grab a cup of coffee or to go rent a movie you really wanna see.. you must CASUALLY bring this up. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT whine or tell her you really love her. I emphasize this because when guys did that for me it just made me want to make them go away.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Just Tell Her How You Feel.

Love is when you actually know somebody, and able to care for them such as a friend, family member, or whatever. You are not in love with her either. <br>  <br>  You probably came off as liking her and it scared her. I think most people who date don't admit to liking somebody until they actually ask them to be a boyfriend or girlfriend and go into a relationship.|`|z2cysiEhaa	If she doesn't like you, she doesn't like you.

eawDlYHnaa	i work at a childrens clothing store and i cannot tell you enough of how BADLY kids act. kids are rotten now-a-days (btw, im 20). I worked at this place for about 2.5 years and i've seen maybe a handful or two of kids that were actually good kids (and these were good kids bc their parents did discipline them when they needed it!). childrens' parents let them get away with everything under the sun now- its ridiculous. these kids will scream, kick, whine, and throw incredible tantrums while their parents just tell them to "be quite". you better believe i'd get down to my child's ear and tell him if he doesn't straighten up that i will spank him at the kitchen sink when we get home with a stern look. this topic gets me just heated!!! if i could walk up to those kids and spank their tiny behinds, i sure as hell would!|`|oFptKbCJaa	I personally think that beating ur kids are not ok, because all it do is make them worst. They start getting madder, and next thing there doing is smoking, doing drugs, and thinking about killing thereselves because they know that everytime they get into trouble they are going to get a spanking. There are other alternatives other than spanking kids. Good luck!|`|gRXy66dOaa	well there is otehr ways to teach your childern not to do this or that<br>  <br>  but yea<br>  <br>  i was a brat when i was young and i was spank alot, n i turn out ok..:)|`|EvIWKqpDaa	Its wrong. It teaches children that hitting is OK and its not.|`|UOmH9vaPaa	YES! Spanking is perfectly fine. The fact that spanking has this negative stigma is a major reason why kids are so screwed up nowadays. I was spanked and I have absolutely no violent side that makes me think hitting is ok. As long as it's made clear why you're doing it there is no problem at all.|`|9qndirR3aa	Honestly, i don't think using spanking is an effective way to discipline children. I think that the children who are spanked may grow up to do much worse to their children. There are other ways to discipline children, spanking, in my eyes, i see spanking as a punishment. <br>  <br>  best answer ?! haha. :D|`|dV2DFXi6aa	NO really not OK, kids are kids they have to do what they wanna experiences in their childhood days, just talk to them that is the better way to discipline kids..|`|BdJLiv7Laa	i was spanked growing up and so were my brothers. and its not abuse. I've been in abusive situations and trust me spanking isn't abuse. Not if its done out of love.|`|MOuapZl9aa	yeh like a light spank when theyre being cheeky and they know that your doing it in a jokey way|`|AA11694815	People that are against giving kids a spanking are real dumbasses. Yeah there are other alternative methods, but some times there is no other option, especially with the way kids are to day. For example you get a call from the kid’s school saying that your son/daughter has gotten in a fight and is now suspended. You have tried every alternate method of discipline in the book for the same reason, but your child keeps getting in to fights. Plus I was spanked as a child and so was most of the older generation and we turned out just fine.|`|WH78BI5baa	OK so this is coming from someone who got spanked and and put in the corner ok listen yeah its ok to spank a kid for the right reasons like i got spanked for little things with my mom and then put in the corner for bigger things i think she was kinda backwards but my dad got me at 9 and i got spanked for bi things and grounded for little things sometimes the grounding worked more than the spankings but i know that if i was never spanked i know i would not be the person i am today and i like to think i am a good person<br>  <br>  but they also need to know why they are being punished in this way explain to them why their actions get this reaction because then they can say oh if i do this or anything like this i get this and i don't like that so much you see what i mean|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	>My sister has six kids  They are all under the age of 9<br>  <br>  Wow!!!<br>  <br>  Any twins or triplets or quads?<br>  .|`|KweMUxUdaa	I am all for spanking, but in the way that your describe it. If a child is getting a spanking and they are not fully understanding what the spanking is for than it can be scaring, but if it is explained to them and than done, totally 100% ok with it. I had my fair share when I was a child, and looking back I deserved every single one that I got. However, spanking in public wont go over well now-a-days, so if you are out in public and the child is behaving, I would take them to the washroom and do it there so people will keep their noses out of your business.

You can go live with another family memeber if you want though!!|`|WH78BI5baa	its hard but i think you would be able to do this have you had a job for any amount of time  do you get good grades and do you have people on your side about this because you can emancipate yourself but you have to have a place of your own to be able to go to pay rent and other bills like that its tough but if its what you want you can go that route
Km2nzm3saa	Don't worry, you have the type of personality that ppl like at the beginning but hate later.  She will learn you aren't a good friend and that you are materialistic and base things on looks and popularity.|`|Nngdk0izaa	Wow, that's pretty harsh. Maybe it would take your friend some time to realize that you aren't really a real friend to her. If you were her friend, you would like what's inside of her instead of what's outside. You don't seem so beautiful to me when you talk about her like that. And what the fudge? You tried to key her car? You should just try to tell her (in a nice way!) that you don't want to be her friend if you really don't want to be her friend. But there has to be a good reason to it.|`|qn9NilP3aa	By saying that, you are not beautiful. The girl you are trying to shove away could weigh 1000 pounds more and I would consider her more beautiful than you.|`|FtS9Guecaa	maybe you should tell her you dont want to be friends with her anymore. and just because she is fat doesnt mean you cant be friends with her. i mean how would you like it if you were the fat girl and she was the popular beautiful girl and she doesnt want to hang out with you just because she cant be seen with you??? also telling someone you dont want to be friends with them can be hurtful so do it slowly and keep it short and friendly|`|Pybx037Taa	First of all that is very mean to say about someone and maybe you should just be nice and confront her and say I don't want to be friends with you anymore.

Ok, I don't know what else to tell you. Try to make her your girlfriend. See if you're sexually compatible. You're probably setting your self up to get your heart broken, but youre young and you'll learn.

He likes you the way you are, and doesn't want you to have hair like a dude.   My BF (who's now 29) first met me when I had really long hair, but when I wanted to cut it short last year, he was okay with it as long as I still looked like a girl.  <br>  <br>  But, I do think you are over reacting, because you asked him a joking way.  Let it go.|`|1EoTIZl8aa	I mean, if you were to get in a fire, and your facial skin is scarred..would he still love you? Better to ask him that.<br>  <br>  Like, he loves you for your feminine personality..which is shown through your long hair.

Which might not be what he wants from you. haha|`|AXj4OnZBaa	you for sure have a right ot be mad, and you're not overreacting at all. what he said was wrong, and you need to tell him that. have a conversation with him about where he thinks the relationship was going, and WHY he wouldn't talk to you if you were to chop all your hair off. good luck love :)|`|1jIzBUkhaa	No I don't think you are overreacting if he couldn't take a joke then he needs to get over it cause that means that he won't ever take a joke from you it sounds to me that he is a serious person.

You need to find the strength within yourself to just ask him, "Do you have feelings for me beyond the physical?"<br>  <br>  He'll be shocked of course, but if the feelings are completely one sided on your part...........I'm sure there are plenty of guys waiting in the background.<br>  <br>  Don't waste time wondering................just ask point blank!|`|HnbJhpnbaa	He was being jerky to say that to you. <br>  Just tell him how you feel and if he is still mad about you saying that then he really isnt right for you.

LT5HlW3kaa	Makes me wonder if they are your friends to begin with. A true friend would like you no matter who you liked. There is nothing wrong with having a crush on the Jonas brothers, it is normal. You should also be able to express your dislikes and likes to your friends, and if they are making fun of you, find some new friends. My niece is 14 also, and she said a lot of her friends who have gotten into the Gothic and emo thing, but a lot of the friends she used to have are now starting to experiment with drugs.

There is already enough followers in the world!   :>  Artist DT|`|QsVltMyJaa	seriously, you shouldn't worry about what people think so much. you have to be yourself because what's the point of having others like a nice person? if it bothers you, then just tell your friends that and that you want them to stop, and if they don't then they're not worth having as friends. friends accept you for whoever you are and whatever you like. don't change because of what people think. stand up for yourself and explain that everyone has different tastes so it's not something to make fun of. be yourself and keep loving what you love no matter what everyone else says. if you don't like them, then why do you care for their opinion?<br>  <br>  ps. i love jb.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	sometimes it is better to keep quiet.<br>  you like them and that is all that counts<br>  why talk about them and get in trouble with your friends.|`|30f515cdf3875c0a4df5afed4d563a8daa	In Rome, my child, you should act as a Roman. Don't become a victim of your surronding. At this stage, you should know that social life is acting, mostly in codes. Follow them, and you shall be one of "them". If you rebel, you shall be laughed at. 14 is not a good age to become an outsider "at home"|`|tQ3WyorPaa	Maybe your friends do that in a joking manner because they dont know how much it bothers you. Im sure they have crushes on celebrities as much as you do. basically i think that the choice is really up to you to make, but before you decide you should really sit down with them and talk about it. yes they are your friends but they arent mind readers so how else will they know how much it bothers you if you dont tell them, and if they are truly your friends they will stop. if they dont, then thats when you know to leave them alone, and find friends who love the Jonas brothers as much as you do|`|Pybx037Taa	People always make fun of each other no matter what it can be about something stupid and I have people that make fun of me for liking something to so your not the only one but I personally think that you should not change maybe you should just slow down about the jonas brothers and bring it up once in a while hope I helped.|`|1EoTIZl8aa	If it's middle school, ignore them! They're immature.<br>  <br>  But if it's in high school, I'm supposing that they're lightly teasing you. Just don't take them that seriously, and listen to whatever you like. Just don't force it on them.<br>  <br>  PS I don't like the Jonas brothers. ^_^ In your face! J K. Still, I don't like them. Your favorite artist shouldn't be rocking a real friendship..|`|AA11103763	It's entirely your choice, I think if you like them then you should be able to have your own likes and dislikes without being teased. I would tell them to back off, and just be yourself. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard, I was always the one that was a little out of step with everyone else when I was in school too. Hang in there.

xDom6mr3aa	ok...<br>  <br>  I hate answering these, because there are SO MANY of them.  Its such a common thing.<br>  <br>  ok.  I read a website called post secret (google it) and about 4 years ago one of the secrets was "I wonder what would have happened if I had the courage to tell her!".  Being in the same situation as you, I refused to let that be me today.  So I told the bird (who was my best friend) how I felt.<br>  <br>  We had a very awkward period for a couple of months, but as I got over the idea of being with her, she warmed to me.   We ended up being together for about 2 years.<br>  <br>  I still have a copy of that secret, and every time I look at it I smile, because I can say I tried the best I could.  It still has the exact words I said to her wrote on the back :o)<br>  <br>  anyway, I've gone off the rails but for god sake tell her!<br>  <br>  If she isn't interested you can move on and find someone else! :o)|`|zD2NWrIzaa	just ask her, nothing ventured nothing gained|`|FtS9Guecaa	well if a girl likes you they'll probably be more shy around you, walk by you often or try to make you jealous<br>  and i think you should tell her and if she's a good friend she's probably not gonna say that she doesnt want to be friends with you anymore just because you like her|`|Mee76uvPaa	Girls show it if they like you, If she seems like she shows it or has a flirty attutidue, ask her out. Theres a huge risk at that, but just say you were wondering and still wish to be friends. If you arent sure at all, make a joke. Say somthing like "could you imange us going out," or "someone thought we were going out, could you belive that". If she gets offended, she would say yes. If not, and laughs, then no.|`|rY1SVpbTaa	If you think that you are going to ruin your friendship over it than dont ask her. or just ask her and see what she said|`|TJeTaqbPaa	Mate its all in your name, exchange that 'g' with a 'p' and that my friend is what it is all about!|`|zdIyqaBMaa	i was like this to exept im the girl..sadly i never got to try it because the guy ended up being a jerk after he got a new step dad ...anyways you should ask her out...being boyfriend girlfriend is about having a best friend but you can do romantic stuff too....just try it and tell her how you feel and promise each other nomatter what happens in your relationship you will always be friends ...say that if you dont work out as a couple put it all behind you and stay friends..just pretend they were dating someone else...like if she cheated on you (im not saying she would) ..just put it behind you ..you wouldnt care if it was someone else you would still be friends

f4126b0baa297b82a91a07ad7af89bd0aa	Be thankful that your parents are trying other tactics to punish you instead of psychically punishing you.<br>  <br>  The way they handle it is not right, though, it can almost be worse then psychically hitting you. What they are doing is, tormenting you, and humiliating you, and just pushing your buttons more, so you act up more. <br>  <br>  Not sure if they are realizing that. I dont know the full story, but i am figuring you gave your mother/father some kind of sass to make them punish you, as u should be punished for disrespectful to your parents. (but you are a teenager, lol that is what comes w/ a teenage girl, attuited, they should know it )<br>  <br>  but where they are going wrong on their part, instead of punishing u and talking to u about it... they push you even farther, and pick on you even more... never trying to correct the problem, but only push u farther...which makes no sense to me.. why punish someone one, and the just continue to force that person to make the same mistake over and over b/c u find humor in it??<br>  <br>  Otherwords, there is no sense in punishing you, b/c they are being hypocritical. They punish you for your attitude but in return, do things to make u continue with the attitude<br>  <br>  terrible parenting imo. Anyways sweety, dont worry its just teenage years, it seems like it will be forever, but it won't<br>  <br>  but you can do things to improve it, talk to them, tell them how u feel. Try to correct things about yourself, to make it easier...and just try to ignore them, when they try to push you more.. they will stop in due time, when u dont give them the reaction they are looking for|`|DgFhlJvYaa	Now if that was my dad I'd kick him in the ball's & tell him to shut the hell up.

(not to be creepy but it is relevant) If you are middle school/high school then just try your best to ignore him and all the bs you hear from parents and the school dont fight him, but if that doesnt work then just make sure you beat him in arguments, be smarter, be mean to a degree that he will leave you alone if you are picking on him b/c you dont like him then STOP,  but if he is bugging you then ask him to stop, dont be to sissy but start there, if that doesnt work then be mean back make him look dumb hopefully he will leave you alone, I dont stand behind this advice for every situation but in some cases it might work use your good judgment, i am putting this out there, hopefully as an alternative to a better idea, this is a very difficult situation most people go though but it will get better best luck|`|XoTH3zIwaa	Fight him outside of school.  If you are under 18 and no previous records which you do not have I'm guessing, then set-up a date to fight him.  You will gain respect, and you won't have him on your *** anymore.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	A restraining order is the first thing.  Then the cops can arrest him every time he comes on the property.  <br>  <br>  I recommend taking him to small claims court to pay for the broken property and take pictures (or video) of him when he is breaking it.  That way he will have to pay for it and if he doesn't pay within 10 days, poof in jail again for contempt of court.<br>  <br>  Also invest in pepper spray in every room and perhaps a tazer.  When he starts assaulting your mom, someone can get to the tazer and pepper spray to stop him rather quickly.<br>  <br>  If you feel the cops are not arresting him b/c his son is a cop, call the Chief and IA.  Explain the situation.  That rarely happens just b/c a son is but that doesn't mean it isn't.<br>  <br>  You know...you can shoot someone.  When they bust the windows and enter, you could shoot him without problem.  B/c you didn't know who it was and they were breaking in with intent to harm.  You have to wait until he is inside the house but you don't have to give him the chance to leave first.  You can just shoot.  It's self defense especially since you are 2 women living in a house by yourself.|`|AA11231094	get a restraining order against him, I know it wont stop him physically, But its a start. He wont be able to come to the house w/o breaking the order. Hence he goes to jail. Call the chief of police and tell him what is going on in his precinct. If that doesn't work open a can of worms and call your local news station and tell them what is going on and how you and your mother need protection from this man, however because his son is a officer, They are doing nothing. Make sure u get a copy of all police reports. and write down everything that happens and who came out to the house(what officer) ..... If this fails MOVE. Yours and your mothers life is more important then a house. Also maybe call a battered woman's shelter and ask for advise. gl

6NbFy1KPaa	I have been battling with this for the last 15 years.

sQBcIcAnaa	95% of the time it's easier than tying your shoe to get a woman to stay – even when she tells you, “I need to leave, now!” and you really want her number <br>  <br>  Here's what to do...<br>  <br>  If you're talking' to a woman and she says, “I've gotta go help my guinea pig deal with the angst of post industrial madness OR WHAT EVER EXCUSE SHE MAY COME UP WITH ,”  You respond with: “I've gotta go in a minute myself.”<br>  <br>  Then say something to rivet her attention: maybe share a funny story, show her something interesting, or hint that you know something about her without letting her know what it is.<br>  <br>  When you sense you've got her fully engaged, pounce. Stick your fangs into her jugular by bellowing…<br>  <br>  “Go! You've got to help your guinea pig deal with the angst of post industrial madness! Leave right now. Hurry! Hurry along!”<br>  <br>  Here's what'll happen 95% of the time…<br>  <br>  She'll stand their like a dumb deer in headlights, not knowing how to react… but wanting to Stay  That's when you ask  for the digits dude  always has worked for me|`|UPN3zqq6aa	ask her i surpose wat other way is there......good luck =D<br>  <br>  x|`|AXj4OnZBaa	Just ask for it. If you get it from a friend, that's weird, because it's a little stalker-ish that she didn't give you the number.

Go up to him and talk to him. Get in a good conversation and do or see something funny so that you can bring it up later as a conversation starter.|`|HO3mCsQwaa	maybe u should say 'hi!' or just smile at him...|`|PrKFlCe0aa	You try talking to him.<br>  Flirt a little! Make him feel good. Smile, and make eye contact with him! <br>  You'll charm him for sure.
XsLj9jERaa	girls usually develop crushes on guys who don't treat them as well/aren't as obsessed with them...<br>  but eventually get angry that the guy they like (if they start dating) doesn't compliment her and fall all over her :/|`|OpOm35gJaa	yeah well all the wholesome ones|`|MPztCHj0aa	No, not all the time.  However, with nearly all the men that we women talk to, the knowledge that they are (most of the time) basically out for sex or judging us based on not our personalities but our physical attractiveness, meeting a guy who treats us as a person instead of an object is something really rare.<br>  Actually, most if not all women like that type, imho.  It's true that like any other human being on the planet, we want to be thought of as attractive or sexy or whatever.  *But,* having a guy who wants to appreciate our personality first is a very rare thing.  Personality is what cements a relationship, not looks.<br>  We want to be appreciated for who we are, not just what we look like--as a lot of attractive guys do (once they mature), I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Of course, a lot of the "falling in love" that the girl did may have been from the shock of being ignored--having her ego damaged.  Sane women do not do that.  I feel that it shows the character as being a tad shallow.  Movie romance is rarely realistic in the first place.|`|997b30eb591fbc4794a68474522f179aaa	Personally, I think all girls want to be told that they are beautiful.  However, there is a fine line between being told you are beautiful and someone thinking all you are is a pretty face.  I have had a lot of men like me that were only interested in the way I looked, and didn't bother to get to know me at all.  In my opinion, women want a man that thinks they are beautiful, yes, but that thinks they are gorgeous on the inside above all else.|`|WQ3uCllqaa	For some maybe. For a lot of pretty girls, they like that attention, to be fallen over and told their pretty. Well, for most girls anyway. I think in the movie, she probably like that she found someone who seemed to like her for her and not just her looks. That is important.|`|mCoipTkbaa	yes!
FIWB7Dgtaa	i think it is definitely in her best interest to just go with the flow on this one. especially since there are kids involved. u dont know if hes wanting to find a new mother or just gettin his rocks off. it is what it is<br>  ***its only been a week. i still think she should just enjoy it for what it is and not stress too much about it|`|c5zT8mv7aa	She should make the most of her time with him and stop worrying, enjoy it whilst she can.

92SRUFmJaa	just don't be shy i am sorry but honestly that's the best advice i can give you because things just happen when you talk to him|`|Wy7oZGvZaa	You Me dance|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	just invite him as in do you wanna *** 2 dis dance|`|Ja1nCDYWaa	Well when I asked a boy to the dance this year, i said "Hey, i really would like to go to the dance with u, do u wanna go with me?" it worked|`|UnyTOXyNaa	Its really hard depending on personality|`|XPu8M8xMaa	Do you think its possible for you to like him if you talk to him more? Either way...be upfront about the friendship. Tell him "he's like a brother." Make SURE he doesn't take it the wrong way. <br>  <br>  Make up your mind girl, whether you are going or not...the longer you wait, he might be asked by someone else...then it would be your fault for waiting too long to make up your mind. <br>  <br>  Personally, it seems like you two have a good relationship or friendship, so yes! Ask him.<br>  <br>  And cute ways would be<br>  --> giving him a piece of paper *would you like to go to the dance, check box saying yes or check box saying no." <br>  <br>  --> write a poem, which asks him in the end. "roses are red, violets are blue...I'm going to the dance, and I'm asking....you!" haha, something.<br>  <br>  --> Make a sign...actually make several. (One sign) "HELLO!!" (next sign) "How are you?" (next sign) "I have a question to ask you." (next sign) So... (next sign) Maybe...(next sign)...perhaps (next sign)...would you..(next sign) I forgot... (next sign) Wait! I remember... (next sign) would you...(next sign) like to go to the dance!<br>  <br>  haha. that one takes tons of patience!<br>  <br>  Just suggestions!
cggkcAC5aa	You can't force him to like you. you might have to just be friends with him for awhile. He sounds interesting though. Maybe You can tell him. Say something like this: "I want to tell you something, but there's a possibility it might make things weird between us. Can I tell you?" If he says yes, then say, "I really like you as a friend, but I've really started to like you as more than a friend. I'm not expecting a response because I know it might make you feel awkward, especially if you don't feel the same way. I also don't want to put you on the spot because I don't want to ruin our friendship. But I just wanted you to know in case you do feel the same way." This always works for me, I hope it works for you! =]|`|OjTejQc6aa	Don't worry, you will get your chance with him!! He might like other girls now, but as life moves on, he wont like them anymore and realize how much he likes u! Just give him a little time!!|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	he is immature <br>  <br>  right now is not the best time for you and him|`|RhKhyol0aa	I don't think you have a chance.
eeP9Xp8Laa	Well, I've liked a lot of different guys.<br>  My real type is the kind of emo boys who wear tight jeans and such.<br>  But, I would rather have a guy who is smart and cares about his future, so I end up liking nerdy guys.<br>  Everyone likes different things. It just means you like something different than what a lot of people would. It isn't bad though.<br>  I have had this done to me too. People were betting me and this guy would go out. I almost didn't want to, just to let people know I can do whatever I want. But, it hit me that it is more important what I think and what I want, instead of what everyone thinks.<br>  I would tell him yes. If you like him, go for it. Don't wait. Don't worry about what other people think, because they will never know what you truly think about the situation.
d77702d18380b25ec5098d026b2fc8a0aa	I know u don't wanna tell your mom...but your sisters health is far more important....She'll be upset...but she thank you later for saving her life..|`|2ngzT83Xaa	this is a really big problem. since you can't talk to your sister about it then you have to go to a grown up you trust. whether it's your mom or your dad, your guidance counselor even, just a grown up you trust and tell them what is going on. They'll help you find a way to help your sister or do something about it. Now, if there's no one then you're gonna have to tell your mom, she might freak but really, what's worse: your mom freaking out or your sister doing drugs and bad things? I wouldn't tell your sister you're gonna do something because it'll just make things between you guys worse so just stick with telling a grown-up. Hope i helped! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|GaJmO2efaa	I know this is tough for you.  Personally I believe you need to let your sister do her.  She's 14 and probably just going through a phase, believe me in highschool and college we all do some things we regret or aren't to thrilled about later in life.  At the same time, don't be a snitch unless she's doing something that could really hurt her or someone else.  Weeds not the big of a deal.  Herion and cocaine is a different story and she might not have meant that, just ruffling your feathers.|`|iRZE3fEPaa	whew...this is a big one...well your sister is only 14 and appartenly not thinking straight....i am 24 and i have been down that road that she is heading down....and i am still having trouble...but my honest advice is you need to talk to your mom or dad one...now i dont usually say snitch on someone..i hate snitches myself...but if she keeps going the way she is heading she is gonna mess her life up. you love her so do what your heart tells you too.|`|lerqDtQ9aa	So I really think you should tell an adult that you truly know you can trust. It doesn't even have to be your mother, but when you tell somebody don't tell your sister you did or the tension between the two of you will get way worse and she'll probably be mad at you for ratting her out, but she'll benefit from it later on. It's better to tell an adult than to let her keep doing it and her end up getting severely hurt. I know from what you said that you truly love and care about your sister so just tell somebody. It will better off in the long run.
cIBqQ0QEaa	a couple of my favorites.. enjoy<br>  <br>  "No matter what comes our way, have faith. We have been provided with all we will need."<br>  <br>  "I know that God won't give me more than I can handle, I just wish He didn't trust me so much!"<br>  <br>  "If you don't push forward, you'll never improve."|`|f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	I have an appropriate saying that I told to my ex-wife after she tossed the man out that she left me for and wanted to immediately get back together with me all-of-a-sudden after being extremely cruel to me in her prior drug-induced stupors and not being with me for almost a decade after she divorced me for her drug supplier. <br>  <br>  "When the well is empty, you know the worth of the water."<br>  <br>  I just don't know where I even got that quote from but it stuck in my head many, many years before it surfaced to use it at that most appropriate time to virtually tell her "No way!" I don't know who should get the credit for that exceptional quote that may be used in many hostile break-ups.<br>  <br>  By the way... your quote up there reminds me of the same theme reflected in a quote by our nation's 16th President, Abraham Lincoln. It goes: "A man is about as happy as he makes his mind up to be" so Lincoln also believed that attitude was everything, too! It does make the difference!

Lfc9Zav2aa	Just say your not ready. Wow thats romantic setting a date for sex. It should be spontaneous.|`|uuHDQr1paa	Yes...it will hurt.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	it is a little uncomfortable - but its a pain that will turn into a really good feeling a little down the track, just keep doing it on a more regular basis and you will start to feel great tingles :) your second and third may also be a little uncomfortable too, but if your bf is nice, he'll take it slow and respect you if you want to stop<br>  <br>  its unfair that girls have to go through these things!<br>  <br>  there may not be blood, i didn't bleed at all first time, depends how your body wants to react.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	yes it does hurt the first time<br>  also, there will be blood<br>  it will hurt for a few days<br>  <br>  really think it over<br>  good luck on what you decide<br>  <br>  usually the first time is really awful|`|Pybx037Taa	You should let him know how you feel first and see if he changes his mind and I personally think you should wait just to be safe I know this is going to sound weird to you but ask your mom hope I help|`|JL3BxW4paa	how old are you?<br>  >>just asking to help w. answer|`|QsVltMyJaa	yes, the first time hurts and i'm warning you that most likely there will be blood. a piece of advice, don't set a date to do it. that's just setting you up for trouble. it doesn't have to be spontaneous, but you have to be in the mood and setting up a date makes you more stressed. it will hurt more if you're stressed. and i just have to say this. if you're scared, you're not ready. it's not just about wanting to lose your virginity, it's about being ready for it. if you're scared, you're having doubts about whether or not this is the right thing. don't do it just for him. it's so cliche, but honestly, wait until you're ready and then it's twice the pleasure.|`|PytiHWE5aa	it is scary and it does hurt but you really need to think about it and if you don't want to then don't your decision is yours and no one else|`|zdIyqaBMaa	i think if your older than 16 or you are 16 you should think it over and if you really want to you can ....but dont get presserd into it and make sure to use protection|`|r9ZFB0n4aa	DO IT

but take her to a park, and push her on the swings... do somthing completely random and romantic<br>  2) buy her flowers. Not roses, roses are for love, but something like maybe lillies, daisies, irises, etc. just some type of flower to let her know you care and are thinking of her.<br>  3) pick out a song you want to dedicate to her, take her for a ride in your car or truck, and then pull over on the side of the road and dance with her to it<br>  4) buy her her favorite candy. Not chocolate...too cliche. but take me for example, I love red skittles and blue jolly ranchers, my hubby bought 5 bags of skittles, put the red ones in a vase, put blue jolly ranchers (still in wrapper) on the top and bottom, and then put flowers in there with it<br>  5)get her a puppy or kitten, and go to petsmart or wal-mart, and instead of the pet's name engraved on the dogtag, get I love you!<br>  6)you can go to a website that specializes in clothing and jewelry for cheap, and get her a dress and a necklace, and then have it mailed to her house, with a letter saying that you want to take her out to dinner. and what time to be ready etc.<br>  6)you can take her to the beach or perhaps on the hood of your car and watch the sunset together<br>  7)definitely kiss her in the rain, and tell her that she is the only girl for you<br>  8) give her your favorite hoodie or t-shirt, girls love romatic gestures like that. spray your cologne on it tho that way she will be reminded of you<br>  9)Find a nice secluded spot and watch the stars together. then tell her how much she means to you<br>  10)Take her out for a long walk at midnight..<br>  11)throw pebbles at her bedroom window...girls are always dreaming of a guy to do that *don't break anything tho*<br>  12) bring over ice cream and a girly, very romantic movie. Try Moulin Rouge (with Nicole Kidman), or Pride and Predijuice (the recent one with Keira Knightly)<br>  13)Write her a poem, and if you aren't good a writing poetry, find a nice love poem on the internet, write it down, and leave it where you know she will find it<br>  14) When you are kissing her, reach down under her butt, pick her up , and spin her around. (not to make her dizzy, but just romantically. girls love that.)<br>  15)Put a love note in her pocket when she isn't looking....telling her how much she means to you. and how glad you are that yall are together.<br>  16)Sing to her romantically in public, just being silly of course, and you both will laugh about it afterward, but it is also really romantic.<br>  17)Hold her hands, look into her eyes, kiss her hand, put it over your heart, and then kiss her passionately. <br>  18)text her...just to tell her you are thinking of her. text her when you are right behind her, telling her how much you are thinking of her, and when she texts back, telling you that she is thinking of you too, walk up behind her and put your arms around her.<br>  19)brush her hair out of her face for her, using your fingertips<br>  20)stay up all night just to make a list of 100 things that reminds you of her, and then give it to her the next day.<br>  21)learn to say i love you in another language (Te amo.... spanish) and whisper it in her ear when she's not expecting it. <br>  22)Name a star in the universe after her. The acclaimed company, International Star Registry will send her a 12 inch by 16 inch parchment (no more than 35 letters) and two sky charts showing its position in the galaxy, which is suitable for framing. The cost is $48.00 plus $9.00 for shipping & handling. Call 1-800-282-3333 to place your order.<br>  23)Send her a postcard with a romantic thought on it. It can be a simple statement like, "You're such a special lady and I wanted to let you know, I'm thinking about you<br>  24)Buy a erasable marker and write, " I love you" on her front windshield of her car {or on her window} (um, but don't use it unless you really do love her). if you dont love her, just tell her that you were thinking of her or something sweet like that. Also, put a paper towel under the windshield wiper so she can wipe it off.<br>  25)Write her a very romantic love letter and hand it to her and say: "I've written this letter to someone very special in my life, could you do me a favour and proof read it for me for any misspelled words before I mail it out?"<br>  26)Take her on a romantic picnic. Bring a blanket, food, flowers<br>  27)if you've had something which is generally accepted as bad or miserable happen to you, call her, e-mail her or just plain tell her the following: "I may have lost a lot of money at the horse track yesterday / I may have had my car stolen the day before / I may have had some other miserable sh_t happen to me quite recently, but I still consider myself damn lucky for knowing you." <br>  28)buy her a gift. Not something expensive, she'll think you are buying her love, but something inexpensive and from the heart. ex:after two weeks of knowing me, my ex bought me a football (he played football) and left it at school for me with one of his jerseys and then later that day took me to toss the football with him at the park. it is romantic and something i will never forget.<br>  29)if you do buy roses buy one fake, and 11 real and tell her that you will leave her when the last rose dies.... it is really romantic.<br>  30) take a lot of pictures together.|`|VY7sgz2Kaa	tell her u care<br>  chocolate!<br>  flowers<br>  comfort<br>  hugs<br>  kisses<br>  trust<br>  tell her ya love her<br>  cute notes<br>  phone calls<br>  texts<br>  special made cd<br>  cook her fav food for her<br>  hold her hand in public<br>  hold her hand in private too!<br>  talk to her<br>  tell her exactly what she means too you<br>  take her to a movie<br>  take her to her fav activity( movie,bowling,shopping,eat,football game , hockey game.etc.)<br>  TELL HER YOU LOVE HER AND SHES PERFECT IN EVERYWAY!|`|3JQrpifHaa	1. wrap you hands around her<br>  2. whisper in her ear<br>  3.

cCymTwdcaa	Definitely wait. At fifteen you are still becoming a woman, and discovering who you are. That is not a good time to get sexually involved with anyone, especially not a boy you have so many doubts about. I say enjoy the relationship, but do not have sex with him. If he loves you, he'll put his feelings and desire aside, and wait. If not, he's not worth your time or your virginity. Believe me, you can have a beautiful relationship without sex. I am getting married this September, and neither my fiance' or I have had sex, and we're in our twenties. Not a decision that would suit everyone, but it's just to illustrate that you don't have to be ashamed or in a hurry when it comes to your virginity =]|`|rB1bJAdtaa	If you two really do LOVE each other, you shouldn't care that you'd be losing your virginity to him like you want. And you shouldn't be scared that it will be like all those other girls. You're not like "all those other girls." You're different.<br>  And that's great.<br>  Just wait until you're ready and then go for it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck(:|`|PVnKQG8Waa	I'm going to go out on a limb on this one and say it's 100% guaranteed he will break up with you within 4 months after you have sex with him. He will get tired of you and move on to another girl and add another notch in his belt.|`|PviWLBUkaa	I lost mine at 15 , dont rush into it , its good to see your seeking info on this at this age , alot of teens live for the moment when it comes to sex . Do it when you feel you are ready and dont let him force you into it|`|6SP9YvDzaa	you've answered your own question....YOUR NOT READY!<br>  <br>  the longer you wait, the more you will begin to feel ready.<br>  <br>  if/when you do do it, weither its with him or someone else, remember to use protection so you don't get pregnant!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck girl :)|`|RAr3LcSfaa	If he really loves you than he will wait for you|`|7ZqSiZqUaa	sounds like he's a collector<br>  <br>  do do really want to be another scalp on his totem pole?|`|ANsznbWsaa	If he loves you he'll wait until you are ready, and if he is willing to wait he's probably a decent guy, no matter what his past was. But don't lose your virginity until you are 100% sure. And from personal experience, 15 is too young... It's not horrible but I wish I would have waited until I was older, at least 17, not to mention that in all actuality your bf at 15 is not the guy you will be with in the long run, and that's the guy you want to wait for, but if not him then just wait until you are at least at the legal age of consent. In the US it's 16.|`|m7NEFMJJaa	15 IS TOO YOUNG, especially since you are unsure of your bf and you already know he's a virginity-collector. Sexual attraction happens all the time, love doesn't, and if he loves you he will NEVER ask about having sex, DO NOT get pressured into it. 15, you're still a kid, sorry, but you are, and this isn't even a good relationship-only 4 months?|`|2hsSRQyraa	keep your virginity as long as you can and make sure the person u give yourself to understands how important and special it is to u. And share with someone that loves and respects you.|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	if your not ready to have sex then you should beable to stop yourself<br>  also get on birth control so when you are ready everything will be safe|`|2RzCfC1Qaa	Tell your mom anyway and get in there and do it!!|`|1EF95BFuaa	people at my school do "it" too but i think its not right for our age. im 12<br>  i think you guys should wait and get to know each other even MORE before you "you know what"|`|Cfw74k3xaa	doggystyle!!!!!

And sense he has had sex with a lot of girls, I would use a condom and not have sex with him without it till he gets tested.|`|JL3BxW4paa	dont do it.<br>  <br>  absitinence till marriage.<br>  <br>  no, joke.<br>  <br>  seriuosly, think of the concenquences.<br>  <br>  he'll just leave you.
BUpcsIGfaa	im not sure to be honest if your still a 'virgin' in the usual sense i guess you are cos you weren't penetrated so in my opinion you are :p.. and you can only get pregnant if he comes inside you dont avoid it just take it slowly and with a condom :-)...good luck|`|Uihh8Cqqaa	Yes you could've gotten pregnant if he wasn't wearing a condom. As for being a virgin, it's more of a mentality thing. Some will say you are and some will say you aren't, there really is no straight answer. But i'd say your still a virgin until you've had sex and enjoyed it...Make sure he wears a condom next time, and everytime...and maybe take a sex ed class...|`|3034584dbe4ac5b4972b9bff2af30d0aaa	No girl, you're not a virgin anymore. Since your "happy place" was never touched before, yeah it's gonna be tight, and it does hurt. I doubt you could be pregnant from 3 inches but as far as doing it again, it's up to you.|`|PVnKQG8Waa	Since you are not a virgin any more, might as well have a crazy sex filled night. You cant save yourself till marriage anymore.|`|DQoRqMUIaa	not a virgin, likely not pregnant but I bet you have some STD"S now!!! why don't you use a condom!!!! your too young to have sex anyways.|`|iFTevsznaa	someone else already posted this. . just be abstinent if youre that concerned.|`|69Qd8SEuaa	sex is sex but no you shouldent get pregnant if you dont feel safe try condoms|`|AA12265794	Haha... sweety.. na, no, you're not a virgin!!~ But you can't get pregnant, only if he... you know.... Came... so if he didn't do that.. then... ur safe... ^^|`|SPPfUgpyaa	you can get preg. if pre *** gets in you...and any type of penetration is considered intercourse.....|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	your technically not a virgin<br>  and the only way you could get pregnant is if he cummed in you[doubtful]<br>  and if you had to ask this ok Y!answers, you shouldnt be having sex|`|cCymTwdcaa	No matter how much of his penis entered your vagina, you are no longer a virgin. In fact, once you start having to ask that question, you should know the answer. If he pre-ejaculated or ejaculated, yes, you could be pregnant. If that scares you, or you're not ready to be a mother, then you shouldn't be having sex.|`|AA11120972	If a mans genitals has not fully entered your private area then I would think you are still a virgin. You cannot get pregnant from what you had just experienced but if I were you don't take any chances wait til you are older to have sex and experience safe sex. The safer the better. Best of Luck:)|`|kyqhMuSiaa	Id say you were but won't be for much longer if you keep that sort of business up. If he had precum on the tip of his penis then you could get pregnant.|`|gktbI6dEaa	not a virgin.could be pregnant, but unlikely.
3UVPe2xraa	AWWW THATS SOOOO SWEET! Totally go with the flowers! It will show that you care about her and thats all a girl ever wants. Maybe attach a little note saying something like "I love your smile and miss it. I hope next week goes better for you." Just something sensitive and sweet.|`|zY8uu241aa	That sounds like a very good idea.  Just spend any time you can with her, let her vent or just talk or whatever if she wants; if she doesn't, just let her know you love her and you're there for her.  Do whatever you can; chances are, just having you there and knowing you care about her will do more than anything else.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	In addition, hold her, listen to her, love her unconditionally, and show her passion.|`|na8ObA5Haa	yes thats a good idea! and then take her on a cute romantic date! <br>  dinner and a movie, then maybe spa time at night and cuddle by a fire.|`|Km2nzm3saa	Flowers are an AWESOME idea!  If you can, I'd take her to dinner and a movie!  Not a really fancy dinner, a fun dinner; like Steak n Shake.  Or if you want, make her dinner and rent a movie!  Get the supplies to make homemade cookies or sundaes.  Sweets are always a good idea!<br>  <br>  I think you are very sweet for wanting to make her feel better:)|`|dtGy6YPYaa	Thats a very good idea actually, tell her that you're always here for her and ask her what happened perhaps its good to tell someone the issues she's having. Just listen to her I guess.|`|BQjw14d1aa	LOVE the flowers idea. Take her out to eat. And if there's like a lake, beach, etc. Take her there and relax and kiss her "under the stars for a romannnntic evening." haha she'd probably like that.. I would. :]|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	That's a very nice idea! Do it!

Perhaps a blockbuster night and cuddle.|`|CzIaAnsraa	<a href="http://digilander.libero.it/alberanid/cm/misc/spongebob.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://digilander.libero.it/alberanid/cm...</a>|`|dYohQxTCaa	that soundsd like a good idea. maybe you could just spend time with her and let her talk.|`|YrbRQi6Laa	Alright Now I Know Exactly What You Need To Do .First don't bring it up right away because that will make her even more upset if you bring it up just talk about something she loves to talk about. If you want to make her week better best bet is to do what she wants to do not what you both want to do. I know this will work because girls love it when there boyfriend listens to them and does what they want to do. And if she brings it up and starts crying make sure you hold her and make her feel better.|`|nxpbj5HWaa	aaw thats so cute. yes to the flowers - every girls loves getting flowers! just tell her that you are there for her and will listen when she is ready to talk. don't tell her to forget about it coz my boyfriend does that and its just the most annoying thing ever. let her talk about it and surprise her with something unique and special to the two of you. maybe you could make her a CD with happy upbeat songs that remind you of her and she can listen to it whenever she feels low :)|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, yeah definitely that'svery sweet, and tell her sweet things like "OH babe, do not worry things will get better" --sometimes we go through phases that we do not favor but, it's only to make us stronger inside, and you know.. and other stuff that you know that can make her easily smile :)|`|6VrI2OHaaa	flower a good idea but ask or see if there's anything you can do to make it easier for her. For example fridays are my busy schedule and my boyfriend will put gas in my car that morning before i start a busy day.|`|7a70fb3c44b029e3904dc31c1edd79c3aa	you seem like a very nice boyfriend. the flowers would be sweet but i think the best thing you can do is listen and support her. one note of advice though. do not try to solve whatever it is just be there for her.|`|tVtmy3B1aa	take her out to a restaurant and be there for her, ask about whats wrong and while she's telling don't be focused on anything else except her, for example, don't stare into space and if the phone rings ignore it|`|eTHKMKVlaa	I make all girls cheering them up by saying, i have a rainbow dick and i piss out skittles.<br>  Taste The rainbow.<br>  <br>  I make girls laugh with that.<br>  I think thats the best expression i came up with.|`|2kpZzg93aa	The flowers are a good idea but I also think that you should probably take her out or something. Hold her and let her know that your there for her.|`|VagRIJlEaa	awwww, that's so sweet of you!<br>  just be there for her, the flowers sound like a good plan, make her feel appreciated and special. =]|`|VY7sgz2Kaa	YA DO THAT! and tell her you love her!|`|Ha0JvCtNaa	get unicycle lessons or dress in children clothes and dance around.|`|kfquQqZsaa	sounds horrible...|`|gRXy66dOaa	take her to the movie theater|`|e9f9B5B3aa	give her a back massage :D<br>  or likeee , ehh buy her a teddy bear..|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	Awwwww thats a great idea! and give her a backrub :]|`|MKHd10MYaa	Your idea is a good idea. There's plenty of ideas you can make happen to help cheer her up.<br>  <br>  I had a really bad day once, and when I got out, my boyfriend surprised me with a bag of gummy bears and salt (something I always wanted to try -- salt and gummy bears -- since my friend said he tried it).<br>  <br>  Something as simple as what my boyfriend did for me can put a smile on someone's face.<br>  <br>  I hope your idea works :]
Nngdk0izaa	Your friend's girlfriend should really respect your friend if he doesn't like her, not keep clinging on him. That isn't fair to you or your friend; she should at least let you hang out with him. He's your friend!|`|Pybx037Taa	First of all it seems like that girl has some problems but i think you should tell someone.|`|RAr3LcSfaa	hang out with your friend. Dont be afraid of his gf.

GqhtePhgaa	The  best advice I can give you is to be yourself.  As such, you should get involved in things about which you're passionate and care about.  In doing so, you'll meet others who feel the same way you do and have something in common you can talk about.  The rest should come pretty naturally.<br>  <br>  Congrats on what you've achieved and good luck in the next phase.
