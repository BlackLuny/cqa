OLD AND THAT WENT ON FOR ABOUT 5/6 YEARS.  YOU CAN BE EXPERIENCING A LOT OF FEELINGS LIKE DEPRESSION, REBELLION,(SUICIDE WHICH ISN'T WORTH IT).

Stress can cause everything from depression to high blood blood pressure. It not only affects you mentally, but physically too, which many people do not realize. You should really try and limit your stress levels. Eat healthy foods (not a lot of sugar or fat), exercise (this will help A LOT), keep track of things that you have to do during the day so you're not overwhelmed, and take frequent breaks if you encounter stressful things throughout your day. Also, something like yoga or even meditation can help.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend seeing a counselor or someone you feel comfortable talking to. Bottling up your emotions will only serve to haunt you.|`|uPqtcXHvaa	Such stress in your life can definitely affect your health.  I'm surprised you're not more of a basket case after all this going on in your life.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend finding a counselor to speak with very soon.  There may be free resources in Ohio that can help you (women's centers, crisis hotlines, etc.).  You're dealing with some really big issues right now, and having some real, professional help can make a big difference in how you are able to process and deal with this stress.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, friend.   I hope you find some good help and even better friends to be there for you.

tiapdoqBaa	I felt like that too when I brought it up with my doctor. Trust me.. you're not alone. According to the National Institute of Mental Health millions of people suffer from anxiety and depression. Your doctor probably sees several patients a day dealing with the same problem. Just be honest and open about it and I know he will be able to help a lot.|`|jQBM2AGkaa	Firstly, your doctor should not be telling you whether or not anyone else in his practice suffers from anxiety. That's doctor/patient confidentiality (it applies even when he's telling you what people don't have).<br>  <br>  Do not feel bad for suffering from anxiety or visiting your doctor about it. He's there to treat people with health issues and that includes mental health.<br>  <br>  If he continues to talk in an inappropriate and what you deem to be hurtful manner, I'd change your GP.<br>  <br>  And you're not alone. Most people suffer from these problems at some point in their lives, just a lot of people aren't brave enough to speak up about it. There's no shame in seeking help; quite the opposite. You've recognised you have a problem and you're working to solve it. That's incredibly brave, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|OEhH9hcvaa	my wife talk to our doctor about me and I can go to his office when I want but is very hard to do so because I never see a doctor for my depression and I feel so stupid go there and talk about my problems<br>  because I'm a man so I suppose to be strong I really don't know if I will see this doctor because I learn to deal with my depression and is more that 15 years now and I don't think there is any efficacy cure for depression and I don't like the idea to become addicted to pills...|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	a lot of people see their doctor for anxiety and depression. you're not alone and it takes a mature individual to admit he/she needs help.<br>  <br>  kudos on that.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	You are not alone at all!!

AA10350894	I get a kick out of how people say condoms are "one size fits all"! Nothing could be further from the truth!<br>  Condoms come in three basic sizes:<br>  1. Snugger fit, for the smaller guys<br>  2. Average, the most commonly found condom, available at any drugstore.<br>  3. Extra large or magnum, for the larger guys.<br>  Not many stores carry the snugger fit, and most carry the extra large, but all stores that sell condoms sell the average size. The average size condom is the one that everyone calls "one size fits all". <br>  The average sized condom will probably work just fine for both you and your friend.<br>  You can go to this website and check out all the brands, styles and sizes they offer, there is even a section that instructs on the proper use of condoms.<br>  www.ripnroll.com|`|6R9McFZhaa	trojan is the best ,in one box I think that bring 4 lol well buy two boxes lol first try one and masturbate lol and see how is the hook lol baby just may sure everything is all right ,and be protected ,don't worry about the size trojan is for everyone|`|ygTSKitBaa	Condoms are pretty standard...

If you have a medical problem, such as chronic pain, or an emotional problem, such as stress, treating that problem may help you sleep better. You may be able to sleep better by making some small changes. It may help to:<br>  <br>      * Go to bed at the same time each night.<br>      * Get up at the same time each day.<br>      * Avoid caffeine or alcohol for several hours before bedtime.<br>      * Get regular exercise. But make sure you finish the exercise at least 4 hours before you go to bed.<br>      * Avoid daytime naps.<br>  <br>  Some people may need medicine for a while to help them fall asleep. Doctors often prescribe medicine for a short time if other treatment isn't working. But medicine doesn't work as well over time as do lifestyle and behavior changes.3 Sleep medicine can also become habit-forming. Medicine works best as a short-term treatment combined with lifestyle and behavior changes.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may also recommend counseling, which can help you learn new habits that may help you sleep better.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor about your sleep problems and any other health issues you may have. This is important, because lack of sleep can lead to depression, accidents, problems at work, marital and social problems, drinking more alcohol than usual, and poor health. Treatment may help you avoid these problems and feel better.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	have someone knock you over the head with a crochet mallet|`|LWwGW48Daa	melatonin

goch9Twpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Detoxification can be done as simply as making small changes to your diet to more dramatic, 28-day programs.  The key is to make sure the program you follow is safe and relies on dietary changes rather than supplements.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Best Time to Detoxify:<br>  <br>  Most naturopathic physicians suggest incorporating more of nature’s cycles in with your own cycles. For example, if you notice there are regular times when you experience symptoms of a “sluggish liver”, it might be worthwhile to follow detox procedures during those times.<br>  <br>  Everyone has a natural cleansing time when the body wants a lighter diet, more liquids and greater elimination than intake.  This usually occurs each daily in the night until midmorning.  The liver is more active at night (1 to 3 a.m.), so nighttime is a good time to detoxify and take supplements such as milk thistle.  The body’s natural cleansing time may occur each week but more often occurs a few days per month, much like the natural cleansing associated with the female menstrual cycle.  In fact, women tend to do better during pre-menstrual periods and during their cycle if they follow a cleansing program that includes more juices, greens, lighter foods, herbs, etc. the week before menstruation begins.<br>  <br>  The most natural time for detoxification follows the change in seasons; spring is a key time for detoxification with autumn following in a close second.  It is suggested that at least a 1 to 2 week program is followed during these times.  Eating lots of fresh fruits and vegetables are appropriate in the spring, whereas eating more brown rice, vegetables and soups may be best to simplify your diet in the fall.<br>  <br>  Getting Started:<br>  <br>      * Start with the environment you can control – your home.  Make sure your furnace has the proper filters, keep carpets clean, address any mold problems, and invest in an air purifier and water filtration system.<br>      * Drink pure drinking water from glass containers.  Make sure your kitchen faucet has a filter.<br>      * Aim for clean, organic food whenever possible.  Try to have 1 to 2 servings of cruciferous vegetables each day to promote liver health.  These include broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, sauerkraut, horseradish, kale, collard greens, radishes, kohlrabi, etc.<br>      * Never microwave in plastic containers.  Put food in microwave-save dishes and put drinks in glass containers.<br>      * Increase circulation by regular exercise.<br>      * Increase fiber intake.  Fiber is what binds to the toxins and fats.  Most adults should get between 30 and 50 grams of fiber per day.<br>      * Avoid trans fatty acids.  Trans fats are poison – period!<br>      * Incorporate a “Detox and Cleanse Program”. Several commercial products are on the market.  It is important, however, to distinguish between a “cleanse” and a “detox”.  A cleanse generally consists of fiber and pushes waste through your body, whereas a detox can be much more specific where certain compounds are used to bind to specific toxins.<br>      * Eat a diet low in fat and high in fiber.  Include plenty of raw or lightly cooked vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables.<br>      * Avoid sugar, caffeine, alcohol, dairy products, white flour, and refined starches.  Use hot lemon water or herbal teas instead of coffee and caffeinated teas.<br>      * Drink lemons.  Cleanse the liver by drinking the juice of a fresh lemon in a cup of very warm water first thing in the morning when the stomach is empty.  It also helps to clear ht sinus.<br>  <br>  Simple Ways to Detoxify Your Diet:<br>  <br>      * Cut back on foods made with chemical additives and artificial flavors; these additives have been linked to allergies, cancer, and more.<br>      * Avoid foods made with trans fats.  They create free radicals in the body which are linked to heart disease, cancer, and other health conditions.<br>      * Minimize use of artificial sweeteners. Your body doesn’t know how to metabolize artificial chemical compounds that are used for these sweeteners; many have not been proven safe for extended use or in combination with other chemical compounds.<br>      * Drink filtered water. Several studies have shown that filtered tap water is as good or better than many bottled waters.  Click here to check the quality of the tap water in your area.<br>      * Refrigerate oils in order to keep them from turning rancid.<br>      * Avoid Plastic Containers.  Store and heat foods in glass containers to prevent chemicals from leeching into foods.<br>      * Avoid overcooked meats.  They contain heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which have been linked to cancer.<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)

3QIWdvG1aa	Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from your heart to the rest of your body. Healthy arteries are flexible, strong and elastic. Over time, however, too much pressure in your arteries can make the walls thick and stiff — sometimes restricting blood flow to your organs and tissues. This process is called arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.<br>  <br>  Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, but the terms are often used interchangeably. Atherosclerosis refers to the buildup of fats in and on your artery walls (plaques), which can restrict blood flow. These plaques can also burst, causing a blood clot. Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart problem, it can affect arteries anywhere in your body. Atherosclerosis is a preventable and treatable condition.<br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Atherosclerosis develops gradually. There are usually no atherosclerosis symptoms until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't supply adequate blood to your organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely obstructs blood flow, or even breaks apart and causes blood clots that can trigger a heart attack or stroke.<br>  <br>  Atherosclerosis symptoms depend on which arteries are affected. For example:<br>  <br>      * If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have symptoms similar to those of a heart attack, such as chest pain (angina).<br>      * If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, or drooping muscles in your face.<br>      * If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral arterial disease, such as leg pain when walking (intermittent claudication).<br>  <br>  Sometimes atherosclerosis causes erectile dysfunction in men.<br>  <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  If you think you have atherosclerosis — or risk factors for hardening of the arteries — talk to your doctor. Also pay attention to early symptoms of inadequate blood flow, such as chest pain (angina), leg pain or numbness. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from worsening and prevent a medical emergency.<br>  Causes<br>  <br>  Atherosclerosis is a slow, progressive disease that may begin as early as childhood. Although the exact cause is unknown, researchers suspect that atherosclerosis starts with damage or injury to the inner layer of an artery. The damage may be caused by:<br>  <br>      * High blood pressure<br>      * High cholesterol<br>      * An irritant, such as nicotine<br>      * Certain diseases, such as diabetes<br>  <br>  Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, blood cells called platelets often clump at the injury site to try to repair the artery, leading to inflammation. Over time, fatty deposits (plaques) made of cholesterol and other cellular waste products also accumulate at the injury and harden, narrowing your arteries. The organs and tissues connected to the blocked arteries then don't receive enough blood to function properly.<br>  <br>  Eventually pieces of the fatty deposits may rupture and enter your bloodstream. This can cause a blood clot to form and damage your organs, such as in a heart attack. A blood clot can also travel to other parts of your body and partially or totally block blood flow to another organ.<br>  Illustration showing development of atherosclerosis<br>  <br>  In atherosclerosis, arteries are clogged by an accumulation of plaques — which are made up of cholesterol particles, fat, calcium, cellular waste and other substances.<br>  Risk factors<br>  <br>  Hardening of the arteries occurs over time. In addition to simply getting older, factors that increase the risk of atherosclerosis include:<br>  <br>      * High blood pressure<br>      * High cholesterol<br>      * Diabetes<br>      * Obesity<br>      * Smoking<br>      * A family history of aneurysm or early heart disease<br>  <br>  Complications<br>  <br>  The complications of atherosclerosis depend on the location of the blocked arteries. For example:<br>  <br>      * Coronary artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your heart, you may develop coronary artery disease, which can cause chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.<br>      * Carotid artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your brain, you may develop carotid artery disease, which can cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.<br>      * Peripheral artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries in your arms or legs, you may develop circulation problems in your arms and legs called peripheral arterial disease. This can make you less sensitive to heat and cold, increasing your risk of burns or frostbite. In rare cases, poor circulation in your arms or legs can cause tissue death (gangrene).<br>      * Aneurysms. Atherosclerosis can also cause aneurysms, a serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. Pain and throbbing in the area of an aneurysm is a common symptom. If an ane|`|6NZeItMAaa	The precedent answer explained everything. The way to prevent it is a low-fat diet, avoiding smoking an exercising.<br>  <br>  By eliminating certain foods from your diet, by including others in the right amounts, and by the use of nutritional supplements, you can achieve at least a 50 per cent protection against heart attack. <br>  <br>  A healthy diet does not mean starvation or tasteless foods. Yet a corrective diet does not mean either starvation or the grim necessity of eating unpalatable foods. <br>  <br>  You do not have to lose energy—good diet increases vigor. Neither does it mean a loss of energy or a sharp reduction in poundage, unless you are overweight, in which case the excess fat is melted off.<br>  <br>   In fact, if you adhere to the low-fat, low-cholesterol diet recommended, you will feel better; have more vigor, and firmer muscles than before. If you have a faulty fat metabolism, the diet may substantially prolong your life.

A mains brain is geared towards sex, because we are the "seekers" in the wild, whereas women are the "nesters".  Women have a strong desire to find a single partner to have a child with, to settle down with for protection.  Men have a strong desire to seek multiple various partners for casual sex, it's our instinct trying to get us to reproduce with as much genetic variation as possible.<br>  <br>  Men are also turned on visually, where women are turned on by touch.  If you go on a date with a male and you're wearing revealing clothing or you are simply attractive, a male will slowly begin to be sexually aroused, whereas a woman will only really begin to feel sexually aroused when touch is introduced.  So while you may be just starting to get interested late at night, your poor male friend could be off the charts.<br>  <br>  Don't be mad at males for being instinctually more interested in sex, many males throw up their hands in confusion and wonder why women attach meaning to sex; a womans orgasm effects her hormones for hours to days, inducing feelings of being in "love", whereas a mans brain is programmed to immediately lose sexual desire or interest after sex.  This is why women like to "cuddle" more than men, granted, when a man cares for a woman deeply, he will love to cuddle with them and is interested in far more than sex.  The thing is, most men aren't looking to settle down too soon, and many (if not most) women do.<br>  <br>  Why don't they want a girlfriend?  Simple answer: Males are instinctually programmed to seek various partners to increase genetic variation in mating.  If you increased your testosterone thirty fold, you might just understand.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, if you are in your teenage years, the males in your age group are going through their sexual prime.  Just wait until you hit your thirties, you'll likely feel only a fraction of what this 19 year old male is feeling, but you'll immediately understand his sexual desire.

The only way to speed up the process is to be diligent. Eat healthy and exercise often. You'll lose over 15 pounds EASILY.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't think that trying to starve yourself or get on stupid (scam) pills will help because it won't. It only slows down your metabolism even more and can lead to eating disorders (trust me, I went through that phase, and passing out in public and having your hair fall out is not pretty).<br>  <br>  If you're really serious about losing weight AND KEEPING IT OFF, this is what you need to do.<br>  <br>  1. Eat breakfast. I know it's hard because you probably feel you don't have time to, but eat it anyway. Even if you don't feel hungry, when you wake up eat breakfast. Even if it's just a piece of fruit or something. Eating a healthy and filling breakfast is what will speed your metabolism up so that you're burning more calories throughout the day. My suggestion is a cup of Special K or Cheerio's with reduced fat or skim milk. Try to drink a glass or two of reduced fat or skim milk if you can as well. Milk fills you up fast, plus it's good for you.<br>  <br>  2. Pack some fruit with you WHEREVER YOU GO. Even if it's just a bag of grapes, throw some fruit in your purse or backback so that whenever you're hungry you have something to snack on throughout the day. If you're body is telling you to eat, don't deny it food, just make sure it's something healthy. I especially love bananas because they really fill you up. Even if you're just going to run errands, it's good to have a piece of fruit with you, especially if you get tempted easily to stop at fast food restaurants on the way home.<br>  <br>  3. Drink lots of water. In fact, like the fruit, carry a bottle of water with you EVERYWHERE. Don't drink soda, even if it's diet. It's not healthy. Drink water as often as you can because it keeps you feeling full, and it's also very good for your complexion. I always keep in on top of or beside my desk, so I always remember to drink it, even when I'm not that thirsty. If you run out of water, go buy another bottle or stop by a water fountain and refill it.<br>  <br>  4. Eat healthy! This is important. If you're really serious about losing weight, you need to watch what you eat. You're young so I'm not going to tell you to completely remove junk food from your diet, but at least limit yourself. Try to stay away from soda, candy, fast food, fried foods, starches, etc. Eat fruits and vegetables as often as you can. If you must have a starch like potatoes or rice, only eat a serving about the size of your fist. Make sure you have plenty of protein in your diet (meat, eggs, nuts, etc.), but opt for grilled meat. Grilled chicken is tasty and healthy, and it has a lot less calories than breaded or fried chicken. Opt for boiled eggs over fried eggs as well. Nuts are very good to keep around to snack on, like fruit. If you feel that it will help you, keep a journal of what you eat and how many calories it has. Even if you go to a restaurant, you can often find the calories on the package or online (check out McDonald's website and see just how many calories an order of medium fries has!).<br>  <br>  5. Exercise! I know it's hard, and I can tell you that I know how it is trying to find time to exercise. It really isn't, though. If you're like me, you probably feel that you actually need to set aside time to exercise - NOT SO! If you get up early in the morning and have a half-hour to spare, go outside and go for a run. Or before you go to bed, take about 10 minutes to do some pushups and situps. On the way home from school or work, stop by the local school or park track and run a couple of laps. It only takes like 10 minutes. Don't feel like you have to go out and run five miles. Five miles is great if you have the time and energy, but even a little bit is better than NOTHING. Think of it this way - all of those calories you wrote in that journal from all the food you ate? That all needs to be burned off. It came in when you ate it, and now it needs to go back out. The best way to do that is EXERCISE. Those calories aren't going to burn themselves.<br>  <br>  I know it's tough, but this is the best way to do it. I hope this helps, and good luck!

Everyone is different. I understand what you mean with crying even if something doesn't hurt. Your sort of feel just upset inside and something like that makes you cry. My advice would be to do some things by yourself to relax. Maybe go swimming or for a walk. Clear your head and emotions. It is a good way of calming down. As for your friend, just explain to her that you have been feeling a bit down recently and if she is a true friend then she will understand. <br>  Try talking to your parents and explain to them how you are feeling. Sometimes talking about your feelings makes them calm down and you will feel better.<br>  hope this helps m8

In fact, your body needs them to sustain itself, because carbs provide longer-lasting energy than sugary snacks.  It's when you eat too many carbs that there starts to be a problem.<br>  <br>  Special K: it's okay for you.  If that's the only thing you could have for breakfast, by all means eat it.  But it's quite sugary, and by that I mean it contains quite a bit of cane sugar; you'd be better off with fruit in the mornings instead.<br>  <br>  Pasta: depends on the type.  If it's stone ground wheat and salt and water, that's obviously healthier than something with a huge number of ingredients.  When buying pasta, look for something with fewer ingredients; the less artificial stuff it's got in it, the better.<br>  <br>  Rice: again, it depends on the type.  Brown rice is better for you than white rice.  For me, at least, rice is better than pasta because it doesn't contain gluten, a protein found in wheat that many people find hard to digest.<br>  <br>  Chili: probably the healthiest thing on the list, apart from the mushrooms.  You're getting protein from the beans, and some vegetables (though not very many if it's anything like the chili I'm thinking of).<br>  <br>  Toast: you're probably using something like that super-soft, bleached stuff we all know as white bread.  It's not good for you!  All the artificial ingredients in it are bad for your body.  Sprouted bread like Ezekiel bread might not taste as good, but it's far healthier - it's more natural and you're getting whole grain goodness.<br>  <br>  Potatoes: they are root vegetables, and as long as you're not eating them with a couple of pounds of butter and salt, they should be fine.<br>  <br>  Mushrooms: they're pretty healthy.<br>  <br>  How regularly is regularly?  If you eat at least four of them every day, that would not be that good for you because that's too many carbs.  But I'm assuming that you eat vegetables and such alongside all those starches, and you knew that they're healthy, so you didn't feel the need to ask.<br>  <br>  Try giving gluten a rest for a little while, or don't eat so much of it.  Wheat and gluten is a bit more difficult to digest than other grains, such as rice, quinoa, corn, and millet.  Try eating less wheat and gluten for a week or two and see how you feel.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, and my apologies for such a long post!

After she's had one, though--- she definitely knows.<br>  <br>  Many women have never had an orgasm with their partner. I've heard many a story about a first orgasm experience being created during masturbation. Some women don't have orgasms until they're 30years plus!<br>  <br>  My point is that it's very normal for a woman not to orgasm during sex, and neither of you should worry about it not happening.<br>  The best way to make it happen is to totally tune into your partner. Don't think about achieving orgasm, just listen to what she wants, and help her relax!

Stay away from white pastas and breads with yeast in them. yeasted foods will blowup your stomach like a ballon. Youmight also want to start taking probotic capsules once a day  to maintain a healthy digestive tract and to get rid of bloating that can make your waist seem larger.Snacking is ok actually but it's what and how you snack.You could try eating smaller meals and more frequently.Add salmon and chicken to your regimen as well as plenty of fresh steamed veggies & salads. I have found fruit to be too sugary  but apples would be great for you.Don't over do it at first because you don't want to end up with muscle spasms that will prevent you from continuing to exercise.I hope your running shoes are good quality because that makes a difference.Try not to eat dinner after 6pm and if you're hungry after that say like before bed, a small bowl of  good quality granola will take the edge off of it.

White blood cells (leukocytes) are the cells in the blood that play important roles in the body's immune by fighting off infection. Because white blood cells can be affected by many diseases, doctors will often check the "white blood cell count" in evaluating health conditions.<br>  Neutrophils function by actually killing and eating up microorganisms that invade our bodies. "Neutropenia" is present when the neutophil count is less than 2000.<br>  Neutropenia can be present (though it is relatively uncommon) in normal healthy individuals, notably in blacks and Yemenite Jews.

tI1Ws7PGaa	Getting Pneumonia <br>  Some people get this disease when they have just gotten over a cold, or been out in cold weather too long. It sometimes starts off as a cold/flu and gets worse. <br>  <br>  Here's a site that may help: <a href="http://www.doh.gov.ph/common_disease/pneumonia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.doh.gov.ph/common_disease/pne...</a> <br>  <br>  Also, temperature has nothing to do with it. People with asthma, COPD, smokers are more likely to get pneumonia. Also having the flu, plus getting a bacteria such as Klebsiella can cause pneumonia. Generally, those with weakend immune systems such as the elderly, the very young, and those on certain medications are suseptable. <br>  <br>  <br>  THE SYMPTOMS that you get when you have pneumonia includes: <br>  Cough, often producing mucus (sputum) from the lungs. Mucus may be rusty or green or tinged with blood. <br>  <br>  <br>  ?Fever, which may be less common in older adults. <br>  ?Shaking, "teeth-chattering" chills (one time only or many times). <br>  ?Fast, often shallow, breathing and the feeling of being short of breath. <br>  ?Chest wall pain that is often made worse by coughing or breathing in. <br>  ?Fast heartbeat. <br>  ?Feeling very tired (fatigue) or feeling very weak (malaise). <br>  ?Nausea and vomiting. <br>  ?Diarrhea.|`|AA12074512	from kissing your boyfriend..|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Pneumonia is a lung infection that can make you very sick. You may cough, run a fever, and have a hard time breathing. For most people, pneumonia can be treated at home. It often clears up in 2 to 3 weeks. But older adults, babies, and people with other diseases can become very ill. They may need to be in the hospital.<br>  <br>  You can get pneumonia in your daily life, such as at school or work. This is called community-based pneumonia. You can also get it when you are in a hospital or nursing home. This is called hospital-based pneumonia. It may be more severe because you already are ill. This topic focuses on pneumonia you get in your daily life.<br>  What causes pneumonia?<br>  <br>  Germs called bacteria or viruses usually cause pneumonia.<br>  <br>  Pneumonia usually starts when you breathe the germs into your lungs. You may be more likely to get the disease after having a cold or the flu. These illnesses make it hard for your lungs to fight infection, so it is easier to get pneumonia. Having a long-term, or chronic, disease like asthma, heart disease, cancer, or diabetes also makes you more likely to get pneumonia.  Your doctor will give you medicines called antibiotics. These almost always cure pneumonia caused by bacteria. You need to take all of your antibiotics so you get well. Do not stop taking them because you feel better. Take them exactly as your doctor tells you.<br>  <br>  Pneumonia can make you feel very sick. But after you take antibiotics, you should start to feel much better. Call your doctor if you do not start to feel better after 2 to 3 days of antibiotics. Call your doctor right away if you feel worse.<br>  <br>  There are things you can do to feel better during your treatment. Get plenty of rest and sleep, and drink lots of liquids. Do not smoke. If your cough keeps you awake at night, talk to your doctor about using cough medicine.<br>  <br>  You may need to go to the hospital if you have bad symptoms, a weak immune system, or another serious illness.<br>  <br>  Pneumonia caused by a virus usually cannot be treated with antibiotics. Home treatment, such as rest and taking care of your cough, is the only treatment.
VJcypcIhaa	I think it is just because you are out in the sun more when it is warm outside and the sun dries out zits. That's why a lot of people have nicer skin during the summer. The only bad thing is that it also increases oil production, so be careful of clogged pores! D:|`|HDnZlQDYaa	well that happens to me too i went to florida and i had acne and stuff, but i calmed down and stuff.<br>  <br>  its because the heat of the weather dries your skin out so it makes you acne dry and and fade more.
gtdUYf7Iaa	Well..... I am not a doctor but here it goes. It could be broken but it most likely is not. I would think it is just jammed or sprained, but I have not seen it. Be sure to use RICE anyway. If pain persits for more than 48 hours than go to a doctor. Hope I help! I hope your finger gets better:)
5fKtkCBwaa	I'm A freshman In highschool and Ive wanted to be a dental hygientist as well. I did a school report on it once and You should go to dental school for about 4 years. The median pay is about $65,000, ranges between $60,000 to $110,000.  If you'd be interested in other dental jobs like endodontists or orthodontists then you'd be looking at something around $80,000 or higher.  Hope that helps in anyway.
NlAHB8ZNaa	No, that's just wrong. He or she should know what happens when your sick and running like that. Its not good for you. You should go talk to your administrator or prin.
1IZwSIDfaa	no i don't think so as long as u sterilized what ever you use to pierced ur tongue with, also just eat soup and drink plenty of fluids until ur tongue goes down, if ur worried every time u eat gargle with salt water with will help prevent any infections

FOCOywTfaa	When you take shrooms make sure you're in a comfortable, non-threatening envirnment with people you know. It will make your experience with shrooms more memorable and positive because you will be more relaxed. When you are on shrooms its easy for a trip to turn bad, so if you're around people you dont know, you might get really anxious and panicky.<br>  <br>  Shrooms make you think alot. They definitely broaded your perspective a lot.|`|ot0WW8lZaa	Depends. Some people have great experiences, some people just trip for a couple of hours, and return to the same person they were. Only way you'll ever find out is to try. But as far as when you're on them, I would say no. If anything I get more antisocial. I hate talking to more than one person at a time when on shrooms and sometimes I even like being alone.|`|GGLh6nqYaa	Mushrooms just poison your body that's how you get high off of them, so I don't think that they would permanently help you.  However they may make you outgoing while you're on them...they affect everyone differently|`|L5I2tXvVaa	not only you have social anxiety you also have a mental disorder....................|`|8260dca222ad20609347892ad4629cdeaa	No  they won't help with anxiety but colors will appear prettier and more fascinating, lol.|`|I8fAJ1Bdaa	It's possible. Shrooms are unpredictable, but if you take them in a therapeutic setting, then your chances are better. I've had several extremely positive experiences with hallucinogens that totally changed my outlook on life, and if it helps your social anxiety, it wouldn't be the first time it's worked miracles.|`|Qiadu2jAaa	I have social anxienty and from personal experience no drug will help with social anxienty trust me. <br>  <br>  Infact drugs like shrooms, weed and alcohol make it worse when you are on them, sure you will feel like you dont give a **** about what they think etc.. but deep down it will make u feel worse! I've done the lot to get rid of it! <br>  <br>  I went to the doctors and told them about it and they put me on these tablets called Citolopram and it has been great ever since!!!! <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor about them and you will see what i mean! <br>  <br>  WHATEVER U DO DON'T DO THE DRUGS! <br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxx|`|9HHvi3H2aa	absolutely not. if you're seeking to self medicate through drugs to cure your so called "social anxiety" alcohol will do the trick like none other.

I do not believe shrooms help social anxiety they are more for OCD. I have a social anxiety disorder and OCD so they could be of benefit to me.
4xkyCdAaaa	If you're only allergic to nuts, seeds, artificial colourings & flavouings then it's perfectly easy to have a healthy balanced diet, in fact I would swap with you any day as I'm anaphylactically allergic to eggs and all nuts as well. You can still eat fruit, vegetables, rice, wheat, potatoes, meat etc so can have healthy meals. <br>  <br>  As for low calorie treats unfortunately most low cal snacks replace the sugar or fat with artifical flavours so I would eat you're normal sugar treat just in moderation with a healthy diet, to be honest you weigh the same as me and are taller than I am, I'm a UK size 10 so that is NOT fat! <br>  <br>  Socially I kmnow it's a pain but when you go to a restaurant you just have to tell them your allergies in advance or as soon as you get there and they'll tell you what off the menu you can have, the nicer the place the better consideration you'll get basically, sad but true. Most of my friends are really good about my allergies so I've taught them how to use the epipen in case anything happens when I'm out. Having peope on your side makes it so much less stressful eating out and stuff. At parties unfortunately unless the host leaves all the packets and ingredients for you to read you have to accept that you can't eat buffet food except fruit. I find as long as you explain the allergies and are polite about it most people are quite understanding and will help you. Good luck x|`|gzjFNwlzaa	idk but i tried a free sample at trader joes the other day and now i have food poisoning :(    (it may be an allergy but either way i feel terrible)|`|c5COgNGaaa	live off of everything that you aren't allergic to. don't eat the things that trigger your symptoms. that's the only thing i can think of.|`|OlELtv7Gaa	ooooooooooooooo....thats sucks....i am sorrry to hear that!!!!!:[[<br>  ugh!! this is hard to answer!!!
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Heart murmurs are due to abnormalities and disturbance of blood flow within the heart and vessels. Most are benign, normal variations in the structure of the heart and cause no problems. Sometimes a murmur can indicate a problem with the heart valves, it can also be caused by holes between the pumping chambers, or just by turbulence in the blood flow- which is generally not a problem.<br>  <br>  The Doctor will do an Echo + other test and providing it's not causing any symptoms or problems and the murmur is not affecting the hearts performance then it is likely an innocent murmur and no further action needs to be taken.<br>  <br>  As your son is experiencing symptoms it will need to be assessed whether or not it is cardiac related. If it is to do with his murmur then he will be given treatment accordingly. You'll have to wait and see what the tests reveal- try not to worry too much. Heart murmurs are very common.|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	3my younger brother had a murmur in his heart..it's not a hole in the heart though??that's way more severe...it eventually healed.actually he must have been about 8 when it healed,if you are at all worried please go to your gp,don't risk anything,that's what the doctor is there for|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello<br>  <br>  If he has not been called back contact the hospital ASAP and check if the doctor still works there.<br>  If yes ask to speak to or book a consultation and tell them he needs to see someone.<br>  If no that is why you have not been contacted, ask who you have been referred to.<br>  I have Arthritis is one hip and when a consultation was over due I went in to the hospital to find out why, that was when I found out my consultant no longer worked there.

No problems.<br>  <br>  My father also had a heart murmmer and outgrew his too.<br>  <br>  Try not to worry, some of these are just "squeekers" that cause NO lasting problems or effects. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about the pain, call your son's doctor and ask him about it.|`|Kq4usVUTaa	A mumur and a hole in the a heart are not necessarily the same thing.  A murmur can be caused by a valve defect, and a hole is just hole in the wall that separates the ventricles or atria of the heart.  Anyways... you need to have him looked at by a pediatric cardiologist as soon as possible.  Yes, it's true that most heart problems in children are not serious, but sometimes as they grow, the heart defect can give them problems.   Chest pain in the heart occurs when the tissue doesn't get enough oxygen (which it extracts from the blood supply).  The shortness of breath is caused because  blood isn't getting to lungs properly, so it can't be oxygenated.  The body, trying to correct this, breaths harder and heavier (shortness of breath) in an effort to correct the oxygen deprived blood.  Bottom line, call a pediatric cardiologist and tell them your son's history and symptoms.  Guarantee you they'll get you in quick!<br>  <br>  If anything I said was unclear, please email me.  I would be happy to explain to you in further detail how the heart pumps blood, and how blood becomes oxygenated... that way you can understands your son's symptoms better.<br>  <br>  I would also like to tell you not to freak out.  I'm not a doc, and this absolutely not a diagnosis.  It could be something completely unrelated to the heart, but if it is a result of your son's heart defect, the reasons I described above explain the symptoms.|`|2c352f403e5609b5ae59fd14690b534eaa	Obviously my first response is to get your son checked.  Call them and ask why they haven't been in touch and express the concerns you have.  Please do that soon for your own peace of mind.<br>  <br>  34 years ago, a friend of mine had an operation for this very thing and her 41st birthday has just passed and she has many children!

Expect to put on about 20 pounds as you get older (that will be a more healthy, normal weight).

AA10369952	Bruises aren't harmful to you in and of themselves, although they can be indicators of more serious injuries.  <br>  <br>  The only time you should be concerned is if a bruise takes a LONG time to heal (like more than three weeks).  Otherwise, they're normal and there really aren't any issues with even a lot of them.

Why are you being so stupid as to start smoking it for a false high for a few hours and pay good money to do it?      <br>  If you can't find other more natural or pleasurable ways of feeling good about yourself, then there is an underlying problem that you need to address.  Fix that problem and you will feel high on life itself.<br>  You kids are being encouraged to dope yourselves silly so that you become mush brains and can be manipulated by your authorities into doing whatever it is they want you to do and your brain has been dulled enough so that you do not question anything.    Only those with a high intellect will question everything.  Which one will you be?  a mush brained slave, who has no Will of his own left, <br>   or an intelligent person who won't be pushed around and asks the right questions.  The choice is yours.|`|AA11285960	yea youll have a smell and breath, AND bloodshot eyes which are a dead giveaway- be sure to use some eyedrops, mints and maybe a change of clothes|`|EoWS4Xz7aa	no idea never did u shuldn't either|`|ot0WW8lZaa	People over exaggerate with this stuff. Only time you should go all out, is when your parents suspect you're smoking. You wanna be sure you're good, this is what you do:<br>  <br>  Eat something<br>  Put in the drops<br>  Spray a LITTLE bit of cologne. A huge amount of Cologne, although better than bud smell, is very noticeable.  No matter how you smoke it(Blunt, J, Bong, pipe, etc), These methods will work. ESPECIALLY if you're giving it 3 hours. I smoke right before I come home from school every day and my parents never notice. And believe me they know what a high person looks like. It's all in your head. If you think you're gonna smell and think you're still high, you're gonna start looking suspicious.

It is a terrible burning pain that you will certainly notice. It is from the muscles tensing up when you are stressed and it will cause the muscles to tense up and feel like a knot or bump under the skin.
rVvtoljyaa	Sleep apnea is a common disorder, and it can be quite frightening to witness a person who is suffering from it. A person with sleep apnea takes pauses in his breathing while asleep. It often seems as if the person stops breathing--then, moments later, he inhales what seems like his last breath of life. Many people who have this condition aren't even aware of it. Sleep apnea is generally a chronic disorder, but it is treatable.<br>  <br>  You say "less than once a month", that would be that you are aware of. This is likely happinging a lot more than you think. I have sleep apnea and I have a co-worker who had symptoms axactly as you describe and he was diagnosed with sleep apnea after a sleep study. He thought he stopped breathing maybe 4 or 5 times a year and even though he never was aware of it, his wife complained of his snoring. During his test, he had 1 central and over 200 obstructive apneas/hyponeas. Your doctor would be the right resource, talk to her/him and let them do what they do best.
a899c2784f7d18371c6b8f614a000c4eaa	You almost certainly (from what I've experienced in the past) have a urinary tract infection, or possibly kidney infection. Go to the doctor immediately for some medication, and drink lots of cranberry juice, though it's certainly not a cure and won't do any good at all without medication. The high acidity content lessens pain by killing some of the bacteria. You still need to go to the doctor, though. They'll take a urinary sample. If it feels like a burning sensation when you urinate, that's a classic symptom, as is bleeding small amounts.<br>  <br>  I've had both a UTI and a Kidney infection in the past...with kidney infections, you tend to experience back pain as well. As women, we're more prone to urinary infections since our urethra is much shorter, allowing bacteria to reach the bladder more easily. That's why it's important not to hold the urge to go to the bathroom, since - as gross as it may be - urine is sterile, and kills bacteria by flushing it out.<br>  <br>  To prevent this in the future, after getting and finishing your treatment of course, make sure that you don't put off going to the bathroom, and that you drink lots of fluids. Cranberry, pomegranate, lemonade, and orange juice all help because of the acidity, though from what I've tried and learned, cranberry is the most effective. You don't want to continually force your body to hold urine, as it can lead to worse problems down the road.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	This painful urination can be a symptom of a urinary tract infection (an example only).<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.|`|1KPUQMMxaa	sounds like a urinary tract infection i have them quite often because of kidney trouble in our family i grew  up on cranberry juice it can help to reduce infections hope this helps|`|4cWtH7X2aa	Could be a bladder or urinary tract infection.

I feel ya! I'd definitely say you have a urinary tract infection.  the blood is coming from your urethra, because of the infection.  if not treated, it can spread to your kidneys :(    just go to the doctor, they'll ask you for a urine sample, and will give you some antibiotics that WILL HELP ease the uncomfort about an hour after consumption.  drinking cranberry juice is actually a myth, it cannot cure a UTI, or help lessen the symptoms -- however, it does help as a preventative measure.  if you are prone to UTI's, drinking cranberry juice helps strengthen your urinary tract against future infections.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|MjUQQyU6aa	If it hurts when you urinate it could be a UTI or an STD. You need to go to the DR. ASAP both need to be treated immediately because they can cause serious problems up to and including death.

Time your miles, keep working on them until you get up to 5:40 a mile.|`|ktJRog7Taa	practice|`|o34YHLiraa	Well keep jogging, but ramp up your time. Get used to doing 2 miles four or five days a week. Once you and your body are used to doing 2 miles constantly, then you can work at shaving down the time. This you can do by ramping up your speed for increasingly long segments, then slowing your pace back down, then going fast again.Good luck!|`|MviD8Oy4aa	Wow. That's pretty awesome. lol. Just vary what you run everyday. For example do a long run on monday, a maintenance run tuesday, a tempo run wednesday, another maintenance run thursday, and a fartlek friday. You should also mix in speed workouts; like sprints and hills. This is what we do in track, it has dropped my time a lot so it will probably do the same for you. And do a timed trial of your two mile to keep track of your progress! Good luck! Prove you fiance wrong! :]|`|M2QPCeN5aa	It will probably only take u about 2 months to get there, but i say to run some sprints and they will help u get faster.

b36dff2830b01401f63d011b8b7d4148aa	As in Genetic Testing? Women are routinely checked for genetic disorders(including Down's Syndrome) after a certain age.<br>  <br>  Also, couples often have genetic testing when there is a first child that has a detectable genetic condition or a history of a genetic disorder within the family.<br>  <br>  There are so many genetic defects that can occur, I think that a doc may order the more common conditions---but, defects like progeria (premature aging) and types of dwarfism would not be something checked.<br>  <br>  I do think that before having children, couples should have the option of having blood work conducted to rule out both parties being carriers of a condition---which could cause the demise of their child or horrific consequences.|`|lnp5yy3maa	Usually they automatically test the mom, and if she is a carrier they will then test the dad for that specific gene. It's helpful knowledge, even if you are prolife and not planning on doing anything with the information other than be prepared.|`|1AWywas5aa	I believe so, yes.

oIDrhHD8aa	yea it does work but just like any medicine it will take time.I went to the dermatologist he gave me tretinoin cream and some antibiotics.After months and i do mean months then will it get better trust me but all i could recommend is to keep using the medicine even if ur face peels,burns,or turns red.|`|laSBohonaa	i have been going to one for 6 months and my skin is so clear i can't even believe it! the main product that i use is Retna A Micro, if they give you Ziana it is less strong than Retna A so ask for that and it took me about 6 months to get perfectly clear skin|`|lZ9Dl5Nhaa	It does, because my friend had severe acne... but don't be shocked if it takes a long time for your acne to go away.  It'll take a few months for your skin to start showing some progress, and in a year-year and a half, it will have improved.  It's a slow process.  If for some reason you decided to get something over-the-counter, DO NOT get proactive, their stuff sucks.  There's another system called AcneFree, it works wonders and it's much cheaper.|`|0O6RBPvhaa	I went in december and was prescribed to pills and a topical cream. It is different for everything, though. Don't worry about it - the doc will know what he/she is talking about. My acne's almost completely gone!|`|FhrCLLzFaa	proactive and everything else you can buy sucks.<br>  They give you cream to put on your face and it works a lot.|`|9mERdJv1aa	The dermatologist should help tremendously. But it is a last resort for acne. I would try some other treatments. But they do prescribe medicine (oral or creams)|`|e8dkQgvxaa	the dermatologist is probably going to recommend you take some sort of antibiotic pills which will make you feel like crap and give you side effects.  All those creams and lotions and soaps never work for people with severe acne.  Acne is a hormonal disorder and to get the natural balance back is to fight the acne from within.  Try reading "Acne Free in 3 Days".  It's a program that gives you step by step instructions on how to cleanse your body to restore its natural balance.  Check the book out here at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bbpgo5/" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/bbpgo5/</a><br>  Hope everything works out, and don't waste your money on pointless dermatologist visits!|`|ievQ3ASOaa	Sweetheart I have the worst skin EVER! I have literally tried everything! But then one day I went to wal mart and bought ACNE FREE. It's a cleanser, toner, and lotion. Costs about twenty something dollars. It works great! Also, pick up a bottle of tea tree oil. It kicks acnes ***!! it's about seven something a bottle.<br>  <br>   What I do is put it on at night before I go to bed. I wake up in the morning, wash it with my acne free cleanser, toner, and then use the lotion. When I come home from school I remove my make up with a make up remover cloth, put on tea tree oil, and rinse it off after 20 minute, then repeat the acne free system. Then at night, apply tea tree oil and start over.<br>  <br>  Make sure to use your oil and system twice a day! You will see great improvements and it'll save you money.|`|ZmdWOOesaa	i also have the same problem and when i went to my dermatologist they perscribed me 3 medications a wash, a gel and a cream to use day and night. they will probably give u a prescription for ur acne.|`|6AEkgBzIaa	i wouldnt know personally, but my stepbrother got a pill from the derma that cleared his skin up like you wouldnt believe...|`|jp8tIHFZaa	Pimples aren't your only problem.|`|9nmkoJgYaa	Yes.

I3qmTqa5aa	First of all, this is just my opinion, & I can help you best I can.  Yep, I'm in the lifesaving business myself for the last 11 years,   I have had medical training,  4 long years of torture!  I digress. <br>   First,  did the doctor wean you off your old medication before starting the new meds?  I went to the <br>  Daytrana website & all your symptoms seem to be the listed side effects,  nausea ,vomiting, insomnia, weight loss.  You're on a patch now.  Therefore there is more medication coming in contact with your system at one time.  It's a trans-dermal system, time released.  Let's say you were taking Ritalin daily before.  Now you're getting one weeks worth of meds in one setting.  It's like taking the pill everyday and going to the Ortho-Evra patch.  Same thing,  you can have more intense side effects since you're getting a weeks worth at one time.  It's time released I know but it can still happen.  Discuss these side effects with your physician if they continue.  Your symptoms are normal side effects for any CNS stimulant.  The cold you feel is the vasoconstriction of your vessels in your limbs,  The weakness & dizziness could also be from this.  I would go to my doctor as let him or her know what's going on.  With any medication of this type it may take a couple weeks for your body to get used to it.  Hope that helps!  Again,  this is just my opinion, not giving any medical advise or anything. If you feel badly enough, have shortness or breath or chest pain, go to your closest ER! I hope you feel better soon!|`|GYwLGjt2aa	well it could be the meds. but from what you are explaing it sounds like you might have{ms}> dont qoute me on that.its just everything u have describe with syptoms in all. i would talk to your doctor anbd get see whats going on. dont put it off by no means. hope everything works out peace.|`|QUJ4F5Boaa	Daytrana has side effects including skin irritation, appetite suppression, insomnia, irritability, stomach upset, and weight loss. Rarer, more severe stimulant side effects could potentially include seizures, cardiac events, elevated blood pressure, tics, psychosis and mania. Please tell your parent or guardian. You may have to be taken off those meds. Sounds like the side effects far outweigh the actual affliction it is prescribed to treat. Good Luck getting all this sorted, sweetie! And I hope you kick butt at the competition!|`|HGHaCWoYaa	i'm not sure but you can go on webmd.com and use the symptom checker.|`|ri5i5oHwaa	It sounds like you are going to die. <br>  go consult with a doctor.
1AWywas5aa	Overdosing on caffeine pills is VERY unpleasant. ONLY TAKE THE RECOMMENDED DOSE AND DO NOT USE CAFFEINE PILLS WITH REDBULL OR COFFEE.

We hadn't even called 999 and he was dead... he'd only taken 4 pills too <br>  <br>  It speeded his heart rate up too quick and  it couldn't cope. <br>  <br>  If you want energy for the next day try going to bed nice and early, or drinking lucazade like normal people do. unless you want to end up like my mate|`|LssMgsTDaa	a gentleman should stay calm and reserved.but just look around any town centre and i am sure you will find plenty of friends.just one thing when you get high please have consideration for normal people.|`|h0u4VVUDaa	it doesnt just sound stupid...it IS stupid!!! dont you know that if you overdose on caffeine it can give you a heart attack...it speeds up the heart too much!!! if you want energy have porridge and a banana! dont be such a pillock!!!|`|AA11530601	yeah sorry but that is stupid because its not safe....red bull is all you need. you can give urself a heart attack you know, one guy who was working in a supermarket had 12 cans of red bull and he DIED- the caffeine brought on a stroke. So think TWICE and just have 2 red bulls - that is MORE than enough, I am 23 and after one I can feel it. Its impossible to develop a tolerance to caffiene so dont start thinking u have to over do it.|`|skJihSWSaa	i know it's easier said than done because at one time i was exactly like you, but don't put your life in danger because of your mates. Okay so they made a comment that you look depressed, it's just their opinion, maybe they said it because they care about you and want to make sure your ok. Just feel what you feel, don't try and force to feel something you don't. it's ok not to be hyper all the time.
IKakoOfyaa	It depends on the cause.  If it's transient and related to diet, simple dietary modification may be all that is needed.  Further testing is warranted to see if a person is diabetic and if so, dietary modifications, oral medications or insulin injections may be prescribed.

xzwZ3lt3aa	Five years ago my son broke his leg. He broke his femur, not his tibia. He had an IM nail inserted too. The Ortho Dr told him the rod & screws would have to come out around the 18 month-2 year mark. He ended up having problems and having the rod exchanged for a plate. The plate however is permanent. I have heard of people getting their nails removed if they cause problems. Try posting this question in this website, you should get lots of answers<br>  <br>  mybrokenleg.com|`|fvuEtkROaa	Last question first... Ibuprofen is for fever and discomfort... probably not much value in taking it for swelling.  Elevate your leg if you start to notice some swelling.<br>  <br>  The rod is permanent.  It sounds like it was a nasty fracture.  As the proud owner of some plates and bolts myself for the last 20 years, I can tell you that you are doing great.  Will you have problems in the future ?  I guess it is possible, but I wouldn't get gray hair worrying about it. Be thankful that modern medicine has  the ability to put you back together almost as good as new.  :-)

sTdlAMv7aa	I doubt pro-hormones would shrink penis size unless they caused a significant decrease in testosterone &/or they converted to too much estrogen/estradiol.  Testosterone does not increase penis size after puberty, so I doubt its precursors would.  There are no studies indicating prohormones affect penis size directly & since many prohormones are now banned substances in America, it's unlikely further studies will be done.<br>  <br>  Androstenedione tends to convert to estrogens such as estradiol & estrone in men, whereas androstenediol does not convert to estrogens via the same pathway (though if it converts to testosterone, it can later be converted to estradiol).  This article combines actual effects of the aforementioned prohormones upon other hormones & "speculated effects" when used for athletic enhancement purposes: (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/whitepapers/andro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/oc/whitepapers/andro....</a> ).|`|2TSJ4RXeaa	if you want to get bigger use viagra  but dude use what you got they like it|`|tIldpr7vaa	No, neither do steroids.

I had acid reflux! if it is acid reflux go to the doctor, and they will prescribe pills for you. Tums and Antacids help, but you end up refluxing up the Tums and Antacids so it doesn't burn but it's annoying. That was for acid reflux. which you may very well have. it's also potentially dangerous if left alone over a multi-month period.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Just Heartburn<br>  Heartburn occurs when food and stomach juices back up (reflux) into the esophagus, which is the tube that leads from the throat to the stomach. This process is called gastroesophageal reflux. Common causes of reflux include:<br>  <br>      * Incomplete closing of the valve (the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES) between the esophagus and the stomach.<br>      * Foods and drinks, such as chocolate, peppermint, fried foods, fatty foods, or sugars; and coffee, carbonated drinks, or alcohol. Once heartburn occurs, the backflow of stomach juices can cause the esophagus to become sensitive to other foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, spicy foods, garlic, and onions. Eating these foods may cause more heartburn.<br>      * Pressure on the stomach caused by obesity, frequent bending over and lifting, tight clothes, straining with bowel movements, vigorous exercise, and pregnancy.<br>      * Smoking and use of other tobacco products.<br>      * Prescription and nonprescription medicines, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, prednisone, iron, potassium, antihistamines, or sleeping pills.<br>      * A hiatal hernia, which occurs when a small portion of the stomach pushes upward through the diaphragm, which is the muscle that separates the lungs from the abdomen.<br>      * Stress, which can increase the amount of acid your stomach makes and cause your stomach to empty more slowly.<br>  <br>  Severity of heartburn<br>  <br>  Mild heartburn occurs about once a month. Moderate heartburn occurs about once a week.<br>  <br>  Severe heartburn occurs every day and can cause problems such as trouble swallowing, bleeding, or weight loss. Heartburn with other symptoms, such as hoarseness, a feeling that food is stuck in your throat, tightness in your throat, a hoarse voice, wheezing, asthma, dental problems, or bad breath, may be caused by a more serious problem, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A persistent inflammation of the lining of the esophagus occurs in GERD and can lead to other health problems. Heartburn may also be related to an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria.<br>  <br>  Persistent heartburn symptoms can be a sign of a more serious medical condition, such as severe inflammation of the esophagus or cancer of the stomach or esophagus.<br>  <br>  Heartburn is more serious when it occurs with abdominal pain or bleeding.<br>  <br>      * Abdominal pain, especially pain located directly below the breastbone, may be a sign of more serious problems, such as heart disease, peptic ulcer disease, gallbladder disease, a tear in the esophagus, or inflammation of the stomach (gastritis). For more information, see the topic Abdominal Pain, Age 11 and Younger or Abdominal Pain, Age 12 and Older.<br>      * Vomiting of blood may indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, often from the esophagus or stomach. If you have bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or part of the small intestine attached to the stomach (duodenum), stools may be dark red or black and tarry. Large amounts of bleeding can lead to shock, a life-threatening condition. Home treatment, such as lifestyle changes and nonprescription medicines, may be all that is needed to treat mild to moderate heartburn. However, if your symptoms do not get better with home treatment, or if your symptoms occur frequently and last longer than 2 weeks, see your doctor to find out whether other medical conditions may be causing your symptoms.<br>  <br>  Keep a record of your heartburn symptoms before and after making lifestyle changes or using nonprescription medicines so you can discuss any improvement with your doctor.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	kind of burns when you sallow then its just heartburn, try a few tums,if it goes right away,then that's all it is.<br>  if you still got it after a few tums see a doctor.|`|2c7e8c6a806e859860fb77a44becc650aa	its just a small case...do you drink alot of soda and and stuff.  sometimes its just not spicy foods.|`|uin3ffWDaa	sounds like heartburn, take some tums.|`|nvHAjQzkaa	it could be...

A good steady walk that makes you break a sweat though.  A good website to go to for additional info would probably be bodybuilding.com... they have all sorts of addtl info. on how to target a specific weight according to your height/age, what exercises to do to increase muscle strength, etc. ---mypyramid.gov is also a great website to help locate what your nutritional values are &  how many calories you should be taking in a day, stuff like that.

Tell yourself that you will go on for x # of minutes. Then stick w/it.  You can become addicted to these things because of the fact that it is a rather easy thing to do, you can get a few laughs, and everyone is anonymous.  The only way is to set limits and follow them.  No one thing will make you stop.|`|AA10493307	As with any addiction, it is a choice of going cold turkey or scaling back gradually.  Write down your starting times and ending times when on the computer and scale back from the base line.

IKakoOfyaa	Yes that can be done and in some cases, can actually be safer when done under medical supervision.  There can be some pretty heavy duty side effects with stopping cold turkey.  However, the key is supervision.  Alcoholics find it very difficult to stop at a certain number of drinks.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	It doesn't work that way.  Alcoholics can't wean themselves off of alcohol gradually, because part of being an alcoholic is drinking more than you plan to.  Alcoholics are not able to just drink one or 2 drinks and stop, even if they believe they can.  Another part of addiction to alcohol or any substance is tolerance--needing more of the drug (alcohol in this case) in order to achieve the same effect.|`|AA11800619	Im not an alcoholic.  I drink to get drunk and I only get drunk like 3 times a year, if that.  I think it would be hard to drink less and less alcohol cause once you start getting a buzz you gotta keep drinking to keep it up, then you end up drunk.  So alkies just need to stop drinking altogether.  Plus, I think its like drugs.  There bodies get so used to having it that everytime they drink, they have to drink more to get to the buzzed state.|`|T333jPUTaa	you could give it a try. its not recommended not very successful. Tell your doc you wanta quit and they can give you a med to help with the side effects.|`|0afb2802580ddca1355870d41d5ab077aa	In theory this would work, but alcoholism is an addiction, and physically it might work, but psychologically the person can not just take 2 shots, they need to feel drunk.
28RK2hKBaa	Lamictal and Topamax ;)<br>  <br>  But not all meds work for everyone but ask your doctor. I have not gained any weight on them.|`|1AWywas5aa	Lamictal is ALWAYS the best medication to start off with. And I'd follow up with Abilify. I haven't had weight gain on either. Good luck!|`|gr4IFLsMaa	There are some meds that do not (that I know of) have the same weight gain issues that can be used for bipolar disorder (but they may not work for you).  They are Topamax, Abilify, and Geodon.  Topamax can actually lead to a weight loss if you are not careful.  Abilify and Geodon are 2 atypical antipsychotic medications approved by the FDA as bipolar mania medications but are not as proposed to cause weight gain as the others in the same drug class.  I'm not sure if there are other medications that can help but I've heard that with other antipsychotic medications such as Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, and Invega, you can try the diabetes medication Metformin/Glucophage to help counteract this (check out google searches on this subject).  The best this to do is speak with the doctor, because if you don't keep honest and open communication with the doctor, he/she won't be able to best help you.  So, with this info at hand, all I can urge you to do is relax, take a breather, and try your best.  I wish you best of luck in your treatment decisions.|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	None of the drugs GUARANTEE weight gain.  You CAN, with work, watch your weight and remain at a stable weight and even LOSE weight on these medications.<br>  <br>  Seroquel is probably the worst, you are right.  BUT, I can say a few things, some people LOSE weight with seroquel, some people DON'T gain, some people gain and then can LOSE it once their body fully adjusts to the medication.  ALSO;<br>  <br>  Seroquel has it's detractors.  And you have to make you r own decisions.  However, I take it, and It is the Hand of God for my symptoms.  Most effective med I've EVER taken, and I would fight REALLY hard to keep it if they wanted to put me on something else for the same symptoms.
1pxKM9Buaa	hmm idk, you might have add but it doesnt seem like your case is super bad.<br>  <br>  maybe you could try talking to your doctor to find out a specific diagnosis, it might be something else.<br>  <br>  explain this exact stuff to the Dr and see where that takes you. if you do have it, theres medicine and patches you can take that really help.<br>  good luck(:|`|a9YfUGzSaa	When someone with ADD tries especially hard to focus (like when they "really want to"), it makes it worse and it becomes even harder to focus.  You just sound like an undisciplined teenager to me, but if you're really worried about it you can read up about diet changes and supplements you can take that might help if your parents wont have you screened.<br>  <br>  I have ADD, and it feels to me like a lot of the things I would be saying "I wish I could" to, you are saying "but I don't feel like it" or "unless I really want to."

7oF2o4q5aa	Usually, eye doctors will recommend 14 to 16 years of age as the age of responsibility for a patient take care of their own contacts, clean them properly daily, etc.  Everyone is different though so 12 may even be okay for some people.|`|pTCcbKeDaa	I got mine when I was 12 and didn't have a problem.

Not only that, but you're also at the age where you are growing. My guess would be that you'll probably be around 5'3 or 5'4 by the time you finish growing. Don't fret.

I'm currently 14, 5'4" 130 pounds or so and I'm average. When I was 12 I was like 5'2" and 115 pounds so you can't be that badly out of shape.

f0oBm7NTaa	Im not sure why. <br>  But if you wash before and after you shave and put lotion on, the itching won't happen. <br>  Make sure you shave in the direction the hair grows. <br>  OH. and to stop the bumps, after the lotion drys put a thin layer of deodorant on (make sure you don't get it inside of you). It prevents any bumps.

ekr7IlX7aa	It's normal to not want to speak with others about your disorder.  But if you can find one teacher you trust, I'd speak with them and let them know.  You need your medication to be at your best and while you're on your trip, you don't want any episodes.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, these days you can't keep meds hidden, they will find it.  Or someone else will.  Are you sure your school doesn't already know?  Maybe your parents already alerted them so they can keep an eye on you?  <br>  <br>  Either way, you should speak with an adult.  If they're professionals, they should keep it quiet.

L30nc3wsaa	It's normal for it to hurt and feel unpleasant the first couple of times. For example, it took me a few months to get used to and actually enjoy sex. Seems like a long time, but every woman is different. Your body will naturally react differently to everything. Just give it some time. If you still feel that this is something that may bother you, visit your doctor and they can provide you with more information. But there is nothing wrong with you. You will have a healthy sex life eventually. Just make sure to practice safe sex. Hope this helps.|`|i8Pl0Pejaa	It should stop after the first time you have sex, but one of the reasons why it still might hurt is there isn't enough lubrication. if you can't get wet on your own, try some lube, it might make sex feel better for you.|`|c2415d71b96d211b01cd85ea7ebe2899aa	How many times have you done it?<br>  I have the same problem...5 times.<br>  I hope it gets better.|`|Gsdb68fUaa	it stopped for me after the 3rd time about|`|AA10344737	I would buy a bottle of lubrication and use it for awhile.

Use a condom.|`|kbz5S3waaa	it takes some time for your body to get used to it, and trust me, when it does, it's well worth it.

He can either lower his pants or use the fly openings in his pants and underwear.  First time I would have him stand in front of the toilet, pull his pants down, raise the seat, then aim for the center of the bowl,(makes the most noise ) and then urinate.  When he is done he can shake his penis a few times to get rid of the last drops (but there will be one or two that will come out when he pulls up his pants.) THen he needs to pull up his pants arrange everything so it is comfortable, flush the toilet, and then wash his hands.  Tell him that aim is important and that he needs to put the seat back down when done.  If you need to help him aim you can do this without touching his penis.  Put your hand on his lower belly in the pubic area and by lifting up on the skin a little you will lift the penis.  Oh if he is circumcised you will need to touch his penis to show him how to pull back the skin a little so he urinates in a straight stream.  Just pull the skin back far enough to show the pee hole,  further as he gets older and all the way back for showers.  Good luck and be sure to compliment him on a good job and a nice penis.  It really helps a little boys ego.|`|LUk7grxxaa	yes he should just remeber that annoying song that came out many years ago<br>  "shake it once its okay<br>  shake it twice and your doing fine<br>  shake it three times and your playing with your self."<br>  good luck|`|OBV4AKIXaa	Haha well tell him yes, wiggle his penis after he pees.<br>  <br>  But never NEVER more than three times!! <br>  <br>  good luck lol|`|SEMILvT2aa	Yes he should. lol this made my day :p|`|X6Di5elQaa	wrong. you're supposed to flop your penis all over the place to get rid of the extra drops of pee.|`|QhOZyKwMaa	Yeah he should lol

zjXchDTSaa	It knocks my husband out but does not affect me at all; you will have to experiment with it to see how you react.|`|F1OIGwtBaa	When I first used valerian root, it was after a car accident that caused a neck injury. I was going through a bottle of tylenol in a couple of weeks for the ongoing headache plus seeing a chiropractor. I was a machine clerk at the Postal Service which added noise and stress to the neck and shoulders. By the end of each shift, it felt like my shoulders were glued to my ears! <br>  <br>  I bought some Valerian root capsules, having heard that it will help you relax. I needed to relax on the job, yet stay alert for the high-speed precision work that was required. I started taking it before work  and by the end of the week, realized that I felt much better throughout my entire work shift. It relaxed my shoulders but did not cause drowsiness. Plus it dramatically cut my need for tylenol. It was truly a God-send!<br>  <br>  I've recently developed insomnia and tried valerian root tea to help me to sleep. It relaxed me but did not improve my sleep dysfunction.<br>  <br>  If you've never taken valerian pills or tea, be forewarned that the smell is not pleasant! The tea doesn't taste like it smells, but capsules will stay with you for hours. After the first day that I took the capsules and burped it all evening, I was tempted to stop. But I'd paid a lot for the bottle and was determined to give it a chance. By the end of the first week, my body recognized the smell as being very beneficial and my shoulders would immediately relax when I opened the bottle. The smell, to this day, is pleasant and relaxing even though it offends people around me. It's worth trying it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  God Bless

Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon water with honey may help soothe a sore throat and relieve a cough.<br>      * Use saline nasal drops. To help relieve nasal congestion, try saline nasal drops. You can buy these drops over-the-counter, and they're effective, safe and nonirritating, even for children. To use in babies, put several drops into one nostril, then immediately bulb suction that nostril. Repeat the process in the opposite nostril.

5OaEIiG9aa	Everyone likes looking at good looking people.  It's normal and it feels good.  Normally people don't become too obssessed over it (although it can happen).  However, you are depressed and thinking about him makes you feel better.  Normally people have fulfilment in their lives and are happy and therefore don't need to constantly think abut someone 'hot' inorder to lift their mood.  You on the other hand are useing this guys body as a type of antidepressent.  You are getting into a cycle.  It's a type of reward system.  You want to feel good and the only way is to think about him.  Perhaps you should seek help with your depression.  The better you will feel (ie less depressed) the less you will need to think of him to feel better since you will already feel good without that thought.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA11530601	that isnt unnatural - thats just lust.

In men, if accompanied by muscle loss, weight gain, and general fatigue, it could be low testosterone from a low testosterone count (determined by a blood test) or primary testicular failure (the inability of to produce testosterone ).  If accompanied by erectile dysfunction it would be vascular.  <br>  In women, it can be stress, lack of sleep, illness, psychological, menopause, or even low testosterone.

If you are stressing over the thought of being pregnant it can cause you to miss your period and your breast can be swollen due to taking the plan b pill. I'm not a doctor by no means but that's what it sounds like... don't stop after one test... you may have taken it to early to detect the pregnancy. I would just go buy another one... and don't buy the expensive ones... if your pregnant, your pregnant and it will show up on the cheap ones the same way it would on a $40 dollar test... If you are still really worried then you should go see a doctor, at least then they can tell you for sure, and rule out the possibility of a tubal pregnancy or anything else that could be going on. Hopefully you're not pregnant, because you sound like you don't want to be, but next time, just don't have sex or be more protected in the first place.

SRaSbCZtaa	Don't strain yourself by trying to do everything at once. To get in shape you have to take the steps at a slow pace. For junk food, lets say you eat 10 cookies a day. Well maybe tomorrow you could eat 8, then the next day 6, then 4, and get down to make 2-3  a day. Since you like soda, perhaps stop buying it so you don't see it and instantly feel an urge to buy it. Try something else like milk, water, or maybe flavored water.  If the place you work at is not too far away you could bike, walk, or jog there. And maybe if there's a place you want to go, do the same thing (biking, jogging or, walking). You could go to the YMCA or a gym place to work out every couple days or at home you could do sit ups and push ups while watching TV.

Here's some tips:<br>  <br>  -Re vamp your fridge. Throw out most of the soda, toss your chips and all the old moldy **** in the back. Go to Trader Joes or some other healthy store with good food, and get a bunch of good looking snacks.<br>  <br>  -Think about eating from all the food groups. When you think "snack", what comes to mind right now are probably chips and doughnuts. Most people think carbs right away. But there are so many more choices that will fill you up. Fruit, yogurt, soup, chili, an omelette, a smoothie, some veggies, nuts...it doesn't have to be wrapped in a kid-friendly wrapper to be a snack! You're a big kid now:)<br>  <br>  -Eat the right amount. Serve yourself in a bowl, and put the bag away, and sit down at the table away from ANY distraction, then eat your food. Eat slow, enjoy it, cuz it's good, right? Don't make yourself eat Lean Cuisine celery broth if you don't like it. It's not going to satisfy you.<br>  <br>  Changing your diet means a shift in habit. It doesn't mean constricting yourself in a regimen you hate. You should be able to eat healthfully without making yourself eat only what's "healthy". And by all means, have a soda or some chips (in the right quantity of course) when you want em!<br>  <br>  Good luck dude:)|`|ConSDYyvaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite difficult, many would state impossible, nevertheless the sole thing which really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 25 pounds, it really does produce success!|`|1bgqq2RTaa	HEALTH<br>  <br>  First, we will start out with Health:<br>  <br>  1.   Acupuncture<br>  <br>  The use of acupuncture dates back more than 2,000 years. This is a traditional medicine of Japan, China, and other Eastern countries. The use of acupuncture is beneficial in that it stimulates areas of the body that have a direct correlation to internal organs. By placing fine needles into specific points, the body is encouraged to promote natural healing, improve function, and provide an overall boost to your system. When these needles are inserted, they go into Meridians, which are channels somewhat like streams within the body. Just as there might be a boulder sitting in a stream blocking the flow of water, it can be the same for the channels of blood in your system. Acupuncture helps to remove these obstacles by providing stimulation, thus improving health.<br>  <br>  2.   Biofeedback<br>  <br>  Biofeedback is a method used to help blood pressure, muscle tension, heart rates, brain activity, and other bodily functions. Basically, biofeedback is a painless system that is hooked up to your body and then through electrical signals received from tightening of your muscles, you would be able to receive those signals by a light telling you that you are tightening your muscles. This in turn trains you to be aware of when you are bringing on stress and to help you identify when you need to relax your body. Biofeedback is very successful and can be used for migraine headaches, chronic pain, high blood pressure, epilepsy, and much more, which can occur when you tense up.<br>  <br>  3.   Therapeutic Massage<br>  <br>  You might be thinking what does getting a massage do for my health other than to make me feel good. Actually, therapeutic massage has many benefits. For example, it can help alleviate pain, reduce stress, and promote good health. When a person gets a therapeutic massage, they are actually getting the benefit of function improvement with circulatory, muscular, skeletal, nervous systems, lymphatic, and can even help the body heal after an illness or injury. Depending on what the specific health issue, there is a Swedish Massage, which is a more relaxing massage good for headaches, back stress, and muscle cramps, Pressure Point Therapy, helpful for some injuries as well as circulation problems, headache and muscle tension, insomnia, anxiety, and more. Finally, Sports Massage focuses on muscle groups used for different sports. Licensed masseuse can help with the issues mentioned as well as allergies, arthritis, asthma, carpal tunnel syndrome, depression, digestive disorders, myofascial pain, limited range of motion, sinusitis, and TMJ. The next time you tell someone you are going to get a massage, you can simply explain that it is for the benefit of your health.<br>  <br>  4.   Eat Less Later in the Day<br>  <br>  Everyone knows, whether they want to admit it or not, reducing calories will help you to lose weight. However, just as you should reduce the calorie intake, you need to know when to eat. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and the one meal that should not be missed. Lunch should be healthy but a less than what you ate for breakfast. As you approach dinner, eat healthy but light. Avoid after dinner snacks or eating before bed!<br>  <br>  5.   Saucy but Healthy<br>  <br>  Eating bland foods is boring, unsatisfying, and if that is what your diet consists of, more than likely, you will be off it shortly after you start. If you enjoy good tasting food, some sauces and spices can enhance your food while not adding calories to your food. The next you grill meat, consider using one of these:<br>  <br>  §   Reduced-salt Soy Sauce<br>  §   Mustard<br>  §   Salsa<br>  §   Worcestershire Sauce<br>  §   Vinegar (this comes in wonderful flavors)<br>  §   Teriyaki Sauce<br>  §   Tomato Sauce<br>  §   Hot Sauce<br>  <br>  6.   Supplements and Vitamins<br>  <br>  While some supplements and vitamins on the market are not worth buying and some, such as Ephedrine, have been proven dangerous, other sources are healthy. Most important, you need to understand what it is you are taking, and strictly follow dosage just as you would medication that has been prescribed. If you are unsure, check with your physician, a nutritionist, or a reputable health food store. Many supplements that are good for overall health include grape seed extract, Glucosamine, aloe vera, and Selenium. Vitamins to consider would include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, B-12, Iron, Magnesium, and Calcium.<br>  <br>  7.   Eliminate Stress<br>  <br>  You have probably heard this before. Stress is a key contributor to poor health. Study after study has found that when a person is stressed, the body reacts. The result of stress could be high-blood pressure, tension headaches, upset stomachs, poor posture, and so on. Keeping stress in check will help you manage your overall health much better.<br>  <br>  8.   ZZZZZZZZZZZ<br>  <br>  Does sleep really affect health? You bet it does. During sleep, your body is resting and recovering from all the work is has done throughout the day. Your serotonin levels are brought back in line,

UOZP4Ma5aa	Yes it will, its not the metal that does it, but the friction of the stud against the gum
iHna2K7Gaa	If you're really serious about losing weight AND KEEPING IT OFF, this is what you need to do.<br>  <br>  1. Eat breakfast. I know it's hard because you probably feel you don't have time to, but eat it anyway. Even if you don't feel hungry, when you wake up eat breakfast. Even if it's just a piece of fruit or something. Eating a healthy and filling breakfast is what will speed your metabolism up so that you're burning more calories throughout the day. My suggestion is a cup of Special K or Cheerio's with reduced fat or skim milk. Try to drink a glass or two of reduced fat or skim milk if you can as well. Milk fills you up fast, plus it's good for you.<br>  <br>  2. Pack some fruit with you WHEREVER YOU GO. Even if it's just a bag of grapes, throw some fruit in your purse or backback so that whenever you're hungry you have something to snack on throughout the day. If you're body is telling you to eat, don't deny it food, just make sure it's something healthy. I especially love bananas because they really fill you up. Even if you're just going to run errands, it's good to have a piece of fruit with you, especially if you get tempted easily to stop at fast food restaurants on the way home.<br>  <br>  3. Drink lots of water. In fact, like the fruit, carry a bottle of water with you EVERYWHERE. Don't drink soda, even if it's diet. It's not healthy. Drink water as often as you can because it keeps you feeling full, and it's also very good for your complexion. I always keep in on top of or beside my desk, so I always remember to drink it, even when I'm not that thirsty. If you run out of water, go buy another bottle or stop by a water fountain and refill it.<br>  <br>  4. Eat healthy! This is important. If you're really serious about losing weight, you need to watch what you eat. You're young so I'm not going to tell you to completely remove junk food from your diet, but at least limit yourself. Try to stay away from soda, candy, fast food, fried foods, starches, etc. Eat fruits and vegetables as often as you can. If you must have a starch like potatoes or rice, only eat a serving about the size of your fist. Make sure you have plenty of protein in your diet (meat, eggs, nuts, etc.), but opt for grilled meat. Grilled chicken is tasty and healthy, and it has a lot less calories than breaded or fried chicken. Opt for boiled eggs over fried eggs as well. Nuts are very good to keep around to snack on, like fruit. If you feel that it will help you, keep a journal of what you eat and how many calories it has. Even if you go to a restaurant, you can often find the calories on the package or online (check out McDonald's website and see just how many calories an order of medium fries has!).<br>  <br>  5. Exercise! I know it's hard, and I can tell you that I know how it is trying to find time to exercise. It really isn't, though. If you're like me, you probably feel that you actually need to set aside time to exercise - NOT SO! If you get up early in the morning and have a half-hour to spare, go outside and go for a run. Or before you go to bed, take about 10 minutes to do some pushups and situps. What a lot of kids at my high school did was after they got out of class, before they drove home, they'd stop over by the school track and run a couple of laps. It only takes like 10 minutes. Don't feel like you have to go out and run five miles. Five miles is great if you have the time and energy, but even a little bit is better than NOTHING. Think of it this way - all of those calories you wrote in that journal from all the food you ate? That all needs to be burned off. It came in when you ate it, and now it needs to go back out. The best way to do that is EXERCISE. Those calories aren't going to burn themselves.<br>  <br>  I know it's tough, but this is the best way to do it. I hope this helps, and good luck!

No fast food at all.<br>  Most likely it will not happen fast, but if you want it to stay off you need to take your time and find a routine you will stick with even after you have lost your weight.<br>  Try a morning workout every day. Maybe a Walk and run 5miles.<br>  Before bed do some yoga streatches.|`|oAstNSQCaa	I suggest eating right, drinking lots of water, and exercising. Make sure that you eat and drink like this:<br>  Healthy Food > Unhealthy Food<br>  Water > Soda/Juice/Other beverages<br>  You can still have a tad bit of junk food, but make sure you eat more healthy foods.<br>  <br>  And try exercising by playing different sports or just running (or jogging) for 10-15 minutes everyday.

If you want to see if you have one, take a mirror and have a look down there.  If you have one, it may very well be broken if you have sex for the first time.

8ee7c07d2a59b0842516bb654427af4aaa	It seems that everybody wants to lose weight. But when most people say they want to lose weight, what they really mean is they want to lose weight without altering their current lifestyle. They want to lose weight without changing the foods that they eat, or without getting up off the couch, turning off the television, and engaging in regular physical exercise. Not surprisingly, there is a huge market that offers shortcuts to weight loss through cosmetic surgery, diet pills, nutritional supplements, and various diets -- such as the Atkins Diet. <br>  There's a growing group of people who leap from one weight loss fad to another, in search of the one thing that's going to finally help them lose weight without having to alter the foods they eat. People don't want to give up their soft drinks; they don't want to give up pizza, and ice cream, and fast food. And they sure don't have time to go out and exercise on a regular basis. So the shortcuts market is absolutely astounding -- $9.4 billion was spent last year on cosmetic surgery alone, and hundreds of millions more were spent on weight loss pills, fat burning nutritional supplements, and low-carb foods. It's a tremendous market, and the public seems to be more than willing to keep spending money on these items, even though the real answers are to be found in something entirely different. <br>  The reality of weight loss is that there are no shortcuts! You can have cosmetic surgery to remove fat from your thighs, or the back of your arms, but if you continue eating the way you've been eating, your body will just deposit the fat somewhere else on your body -- usually in a place that looks even stranger than when it was on your hips. Even if the cosmetic surgery works out for you, it doesn't alter your blood chemistry, your cardiovascular health, or your level of physical fitness. Meaning that you are just as unhealthy after the surgery as you were before, even though you may physically show less body fat. Something similar is true with foods as well. Many people continue to eat a diet high in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, and obesity-promoting ingredients, such as high-fructose corn syrup. Then in an attempt to lose weight, they will take a couple of weight loss pills each day, and hope that those pills will some how counteract the entire day of eating unhealthy, obesity-promoting foods. It just doesn't work this way. <br>  If you really want to lose weight, you've got to do two things. First you have to avoid foods that promote obesity and weight-gain. These are the foods that are consumed by the vast majority of Americans, and are the ones that are the most popular in grocery stores and restaurants. Any food that's processed or manufactured is very likely to promote obesity, or some other chronic disease. Foods made with refined white flour or refined sugar, for example, will undoubtedly alter your blood sugar levels and tell your body to start storing fat. Foods high in saturated animal fats, such as red meat, or foods that are high in hydrogenated oils, like margarine or shortening, will also pack on the body fat, and harm your cardio-vascular health at the same time. Achieving a healthy body weight absolutely requires taking these foods out of your diet for the rest of your life. You can have either soft drinks and processed foods, or a healthy body weight -- but not both. In fact, much of the foods available today in the national food supply are simply incompatible with a healthy body weight, no matter how much surgery you undergo, and no matter how many weight loss supplements you attempt to take. <br>  The other part of the equation here is physical exercise. The human body simply won't shed excess body fat without engaging in regular physical exercise. Physical exercise gives you a much higher metabolism; it helps you burn calories, even while you're sitting or sleeping. It also increases your lean body mass -- especially when you engage in strength training -- and that results in even more calories being burned when you are at rest. Physical exercise, in fact, modifies your body chemistry in a way that helps your body better use refined foods such as breads or pasta. When you eat those foods without engaging in physical exercise, you're automatically going to add weight. But when you have an extremely fit body that engages in regular exercise, such as jogging, swimming, walking, or biking, you can get away with eating a few processed foods. But still you have to limit your intake of processed foods if you want to maintain a healthy body weight. <br>  In my own case, I engage in rather vigorous physical exercise several times per week, typically putting in 10 hours of exercise each week. And even then, I don't allow myself to eat any breads or pasta or refined carbohydrates of any kind. I don't consume breakfast cereals; I don't drink fruit-drinks or consume soft drinks. And what I've found is that if I eat a piece of bread or have a sandwich, then those refined carbohydrates alter my blood sugar in a way that makes me extremely hungry three or four hours later. If I had eaten a high protein meal, or a meal high in healthy fats and fibers, I wouldn't be hungry so quickly. So it is these processed foods that are in fact causing the obesity in the first place. And consuming diet pills or weight loss supplements simply isn't the answer to long-term weight loss. The answer is to look at your lifestyle, examine what you're doing wrong that needs to be corrected, and then have the courage to make the changes that will bring you into a healthy body weight and keep you there for life.|`|9bd4f9dcf34a2c43bdbd2fe05bcb3702aa	Pills don't work. some make you think your are losing, but when you go off of them all the weight comes right back on. some are bad for you health and several companies just got slapped with millions of dollars worth of fines for false advertising. the only thing that get thinner on diet pills is your wallet<br>  <br>  If there was a diet pill that worked, there would not be any overweight people|`|99c4bdb96fbbce2446cc584a907512caaa	Yes, My husband took them and lost 29 pounds in a month taking 1 a day. but once he quit taking them he gained all the weight back plus 3 pounds more in a little over a month.|`|153f9b430480be9da04bd9fa11628d4caa	NO!  The answer to weight loss isn't in a pill.  This amphetamine is very dangerous, damaging to the heart and brain, and will only cause you to lose peace, serenity, and sensibility.  Amphetamines will suppress an appetite for as long as you're on them, but that doesn't cause healthy weight loss.  You stop eating, your body goes into starvation mode, and begins storing what you do eat as fat.  It refuses to burn fat, you burn protein (muscle) instead, you shrink and it looks better, but you now have less fat-burning machine to do the work.  As soon as you stop taking the drugs, you begin eating normally again, and gain everything back as fat.  NOW, you have less muscle to burn off that fat the right way.  It offers nothing but an insideous downward spiral of failure.<br>       Here's what works;  1.  Eat sensibly and frequently, and 2. Exercise regularly and consistently.  That's it, there's no secret, there's no magic, and all of this only requires that you be smarter than your fat cells.  The fast and easy way is never as easy as it's portrayed to be and only offers seriously negative consequences.

There is the Tahitian Noni that started in 1996 followed by more and more Noni but they are called the Phoney Noni's because the real Tahitian Noni is not duplicable.

Thanks for asking!|`|AA10757126	The name Tahitian Noni comes from a Multi level company that first flavored Noni and sold it through a MLM distribution model. The Pacific Polynesians have been drinking Noni juice for 2,000 years for its medicinal health benefits.<br>  <br>  Tahitian just means it was grown in Tahiti. Noni also grows in Hawaii, Fiji, Cook Islands and other tropical places. You would be better off buying the organic Noni from Lakewood because its pure Noni juice and for half the price of TAHITIAN NONI Internationals product TNJ.<br>  <br>  "AAAMIE1" assertion that TNJ cannot be duplicated is not true, actually there are many companies that offer flavored Noni juice comparable, such as Tahiti Trader who also weaken the Noni juices potency by adding grape, blueberry concentrate with water. But like the product AAAMIE1 is peddling (Mangosteen) TAHITIAN NONI must inflate the price for their juice to payoff the layers of distributors that make-up the MLM pyramid.<br>  <br>  To recap: make sure the Noni is pure and look at the bottle size Some companies sell 16 oz bottles for $16 to $18 per bottle and if you compare the size with 32 ounce bottles you would be pay close to $40 per bottle. <br>  <br>  I buy Tru Noni juice online and it comes in  32 ounce glass bottles and if you are paying more than that for Lakewood you might consider buying your Noni juice on the Internet.

Bloating is common, especially for women.  Bodybuilders actually restrict their water because they want a defined look.  You shouldn't do that, but make sure you don't overdo it with water.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you're reaching the age where most people's metabolism starts to change.  Basically until 30's your body is still growing, strengthening, maturing.  After 30 you really don't need much calories to maintain weight.  Either you have to do more to get metabolism up, or you have to restrict calories more.  Or combo of both.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, some sorts of exercise will thicken the "wrong" areas, especially for women.  Sit-ups will actually thicken your waist, lunges will thicken your butt, and chest exercises will thicken your chest.  You may want to consider consulting a personal trainer.<br>  <br>  Lastly, maybe it is just a self-image problem.  Do you feel healthy?  If so, don't worry about it.|`|cc35735cbf0dba61bdbc142d991ab28baa	I had similar symptoms and was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, you might want to look into that. and also I had an IUD inserted 15 months prior and they thought maybe that could have been a cause too...I don't know what your using for birth control, but many of them will cause some weight gain.i have since had that removed and the doctors are working on getting my thyroid levels right... good luck|`|cea336f0e7d0e43de9257cb20c3ca743aa	you could be pregnet,even though your spotting.Buy a test.

AA11635384	well apparently you get it from unprotected sex. See this is what I don't get, until I met my fiance I always used a condom and always had a boyfriend but I got it when I was 24. Now if you are under 26 I think you can get a shot and boy let me tell you, you'd much rather get a shot than get the treatment for it. You can't tell if you have it or not, there are no signs or symptoms. Everything appears normal but it will show up as abnormal cells in your pap smear in which case your GYN will then have to perform a "colospoy" on you where they go up your bajinko and take a closer look at the cells with a small camera, you are awake for the procedure and you will want to die. If you do have cancerous cells they will scrape your cervix to remove them and you will have to have a pap every 3 months after until they are sure it totally clears. Just get the shot, trust me, even if you are safe like I was apparently you can get it.|`|Fjzkf5Apaa	You get HPV through having sex or genital to genital contact.

If so then you maybe plan to have a sex change or you just wanna be a she-male... Either way self administering any estrogens (synthetic or otherwise) can be very dangerous, you need to have them prescribed by a doctor that has done the necessary tests & evaluations... A doctor that works with transexuals and can maintain the safest dosages & quality of estrogens,progesterones &  anti-androgens...so your transformation doesn't compromise your health...you can't always be sure of what you're getting from online pharmacies,transexual resource sites & the like...whatever you opt for, you just need to make sure you're doing it safely...good luck to you|`|3e5f8bdc9500f1153a912201856a9b2aaa	kmart..

But then you can just cut back on the more developed muscle.

What matters is the intensity you put into each exercise.  If you want a certain muscle to grow relative to others, then you need to exercise the muscle you want to grow more intensely.  Note that intensity does not always mean higher weight, or higher reps, but is a matter of how you contract your muscles.  In any case, any imbalance in muscle development can be fixed by changing your focus in your routine.|`|OODYTQ7jaa	Try to balance the STRENGTH of your bicep and tricep since these are opposing muscles (opposing muscles are pairs in which 1 group completely relaxes for the other group to fully constract [flex]).<br>  <br>  Mismatches in opposing groups can really improve the odds of injuring the weaker group.<br>  major groups are biceps/triceps, chest/lats, lower back/abs quad/hamstrings.  Train the weaker group twice as much until strengths match.|`|c82a5b71da4fdfa2a58bd92e8a358925aa	Muscle growth isnt going to be affected by a short time in the delay of training of the antagonist vs agonist pairing. Additionally, since the insertion and origin of your muscles can vary, they may not always match according to the time you train them and may in time look unbalanced. They're muscles, not auto parts; they're not all perfectly the same.

CuW5mveJaa	Are You a Good Candidate for Lasik? <br>  Lasik is not for everyone. <br>  <br>  You should be at least 18 years old (21 for some lasers), since the vision of people younger than 18 usually continues to change. <br>  You should not be pregnant or nursing as these conditions might change the measured refraction of the eye. <br>  You should not be taking certain prescription drugs, such as Accutane or oral prednisone. <br>  Your eyes must be healthy and your prescription stable. If you're myopic, you should postpone Lasik until your refraction has stabilized, as myopia may continue to increase in some patients until their mid- to late 20s. <br>  You should be in good general health. Lasik may not be recommended for patients with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, glaucoma, herpes infections of the eye, or cataracts. You should discuss this with your surgeon. <br>  Weigh the risks and rewards. If you're happy wearing contacts or glasses, you may want to forego the surgery. <br>  Understand your expectations from the surgery. Are they realistic? <br>  Ask your doctor if you're a candidate for monovision — correcting one eye for distance vision and the other eye for near vision. Lasik cannot correct presbyopia so that one eye can see at both distance and near. However, Lasik can be used to correct one eye for distance and the other for near. If you can adjust to this correction, it may eliminate or reduce your need for reading glasses. In some instances, surgery on only one eye is required. If your doctor thinks you're a candidate, ask about the pros and cons. <br>  Click on the link below to read more about Lasik Eye Surgery..Procedures, ect|`|f82e67c35bf52de5fa5971654f9572d8aa	No, I have a right lazy eye too.

What you have is very common and affects a mass majority of america, how ever if you would like to try contact first more than likely (toric contacts) since more ab patients are majority astitigasim which is also correctable during the procedure.  Let me know what town you are in and I can arrange a free consulation with a good surgeon.  Hope this helps.

The body hair, if coarse or spread further apart is more difficult to cling on and lay their eggs so they tend to stay on the head.|`|84e3267504eea1bf89bf550ce051e4f9aa	you betcha!  buy enough "Quell" to douse the whole body.|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	Yes the lice could migrate to other parts of his body.

Its hard to explain - I want to talk and open up, but I just can't seem to find the words.<br>  <br>  You can keep going, the counsellor will understand if you don't manage to talk about things - sometimes it gets easier after a few sessions.<br>  <br>  Another option you can consider is to write your feelings down, or keep an audio diary.  Sometimes this feels safer than talking to a 'real' person, as there is no risk of anyone laughing at you (a totally irrational worry, but one a lot of us seem to have). <br>  <br>  Maybe taking in a list of key points might help you talk?  You can give a list with a few bullet points to your counsellor, who will then be able to ask a few questions, which might help you open up.<br>  <br>  I think that externalising your thoughts and feelings is a vital part of the healing process, so if things don't work for you, please keep trying.<br>  <br>  You are entitled to see another doctor if you feel that you aren't been taken seriously - just ask at reception to see a different doctor.<br>  <br>  You can get more information on eating disorders on line at: <a href="http://www.b-eat.co.uk/HelpandSupport" rel="nofollow">http://www.b-eat.co.uk/HelpandSupport</a> and if you want to talk, feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  Best wishes xx|`|b696a5c3d890f8b4c58873a32657cd6caa	Talk to me babe if you like. its on the net and not so daunting, pauline.neild@btinternet.com|`|zUZJSajIaa	I didn't like talking to a councellor but you never know, you should try it.|`|5BcLU5Ayaa	Have you tried writing down your feelings in letter format - plan to not give it to anybody so write it to sombody make believe - then when it's finnished and all your honest inner thoughts and feelings are out on paper, fold it up and store it somewhere so you can come to terms with it all.<br>  <br>  Once you feel comfortable with your feelings consider giving it to whoever you feel may be best placed to help - family or friend that you know will support you or just your counsellor.<br>  <br>  Your not on your own and by thinking about getting help you are already making big steps.|`|970b5c4b3e242e866d8b89a27a78b864aa	I can relate to how you are feeling right now, although my reasons for needing to see a councillor are different.

I'm not a doctor I've just read self help books about this stuff hope it helps a little.(excuse the cliche) happy thoughts.!|`|twiBHA5qaa	Yes it can be daunting talking to a stranger but i find if you talk to people that really know you they judge you & think you are making it up.<br>  I would have reported the psychiatric nurse how unprofessional was she!!<br>  Believe me talking to a complete stranger does help.Ask your Dr if you can see a psychotherapist,tell him you want to get through this problem but need help.Tell the psychotherapist how you tend to clam up,they will help you get to the root of the problem.It took me a long time to talk to Drs,Psychiatrists but the psychotherapist is different,she has gone through everything with me from childhood to now & i can talk to her without feeling like a complete fool.Please try it,it will help.Good luck!! xx
L5nNZx7Daa	I have suffered from insomnia since I was about 11 or 12.  You probably lay in bed and your body feels tired but your mind won't stop racing.  Its extremely frustrating, i know, to just sit there and watch the clock for hours worrying about how early you have to get up.  Here are a few suggestions that worked for me:<br>  1.) Get more exercise during the day, it will help you relax more at night and your body will thank you.<br>  <br>  2.) Go see your family doctor, tell him/her what exactly you are experiencing.  There are alot of good sleep aids (many of them non-prescription and all natural) on the market nowadays.  I have been taking Lunesta for nearly a year now and I must say it is amazing.<br>  <br>  3.) Read for 1 hour before bed instead of watching TV.  Studies have proven that reading helps relax the body and mind, while TV only stimulates your brain and nervous system, making it even more difficult to sleep.<br>  <br>  4.) Stretch before bed.  It may sound wierd but you would be amazed at how much more comfortable your bed will feel with loose muscles.<br>  <br>  These are things that worked for me and I am now 23.  Also keep in mind that, at age 15, you are in a an emotionally and physically transformation period and have alot going on in your daily social life.  It is more than natural to take these things to bed with you at night, but just try to relax.  Good luck and Good night.|`|XQLIeB3aaa	Go to webmd.com. They will tell you.

I've often felt like I couldn't fully breathe and it turned out to be a vertebra out of place! If  it is a muscle thing, then one explanation is that your blood may not have enough iron. This is what is known as anemia. Your doctor can tell you if you are anemic, and iron pills are easy to get. Many green leafy vegtables-especially kale-have lots of iron as well.

But, for right now, I know of one thing...  I try to be aware of when I bump or stumble or fall into something, and the minute it happens I reach for a piece of ice and rub it back and forth over the place for several minutes.  I just did this day before yesterday, the second I hit my leg on the dishwasher door that was open and laying out across my path.  It was an instant reaction and one I had not tried before, but now I remember hearing it.  Long story short... usually I'm real red, then the next several days it gets to go from blue to black.

It is filmed exquisitely and tastefully in various attractive, serene and some remote settings of the Vancouver area.   Not just a lame yoga meditation program out of a boring studio.   The cinemtography is superb and in high-definition with excellent backqround music and instructions and commands whispered (by Kate Potter) to three beautifully in-shape women cast members for her viewers to follow their perfect choreographed example of transitional hatha yoga postures in the comfort of their home.

AA11728843	I am assuming you mean the top end...you will not be allowed to eat or drink after midnite.  When you get to the place your test will be done, they will do all the admission or whatever, start an IV, hook you up to a heart monitor, give you something thru your IV to sedate you & when you wake up they are done!  They aren't bad at all, you may have a bit of a sore throat but that should be it.  The bottom end is about the same that morning, it is that night when you have the prep to clean you out....it is NASTY! And your but gets sore.  Usually have to take again that morning too.  Good luck, hope all goes well!

Start out slow, remember Rome wasn't built in a day and it did not burn in a day either, meaning you did not gain 100# over night, therefore you will not lose it over night! Keep up your spirits, maybe a weight loss support group will give you the encouragement you need. I would also suggest to ask your doctor for some sensible food plans to get you started. Best of luck in your pursuit!|`|9bd4f9dcf34a2c43bdbd2fe05bcb3702aa	Weight Watchers is a good natural program, its a healthy lifestyle

I would suggest finding someone in your gym who obviously juices. Make friends with them first. Offer to spot them and try to workout together. After talking to them for a little while, ask if they have a good source. That is the best way, because if you just approach someone and you don't know them, they won't tell you and they might get mad.

I gained about 10 pounds (in muscle) over the course of a year.

Having a two month old baby often puts people into that category!|`|bebefaf34a6c0ac4b567ff1ca1e95f37aa	The best thing I have ever used for cold sores is Lactinex pills. Ask your pharmacist. They are not prescription, but have to be refrigerated so they are not out on the counter. They somehow replace healthy microbes in the body that suppress the herpes virus. Start taking them at the first tingle, and sometimes it won't even go ahead to develop into a cold sore. Stop taking them when the cold sore or the feeling of a cold sore is gone.<br>  The second best thing is Acidophilus pills. I believe it works the same way as the Lactinex but it takes longer. You will find it in the vitamin section. Again, ask your pharmacist how many you can safely take. Stop taking them once the threat of cold sore has passed.<br>  This must be the best kept secret ever because I tried everything else to no avail until my pharmacist told me about the Lactinex. <br>  I tried Lysine, but it did nothing to help me. <br>  I hope this works as well for you as it has for me. I have often wondered if it would work for genital herpes as well, but I just don't know.
a57890253bdbf16fd7eb35f9b0eebe3eaa	Skin is one of the most sensitive parts of our body, which necessitates a lot of care. Due to the triggers that are present in the environment around us, our skin can get victimized by skin related infections and diseases. Acne is one such skin related problems, which most of us are facing or have faced. Acne is mostly found among teens, which is a result of the hormonal changes in the puberty phase. Other factors which can trigger acne can be accounted as hard scrubbing, environmental factors amid others.<br>  <br>  Acne is primarily characterized by appearance of papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, and comedones. Acne constitutes variations, which range from mild to severe acne disfiguring. Acne vulgaris is one of the most popular forms of acne which includes various spots such as whiteheads, blackheads, papules, and pustules. Severe form of acne is quite rare, which can be very bothersome.<br>  <br>  Is your skin affected by acne? Acne affected skin is prone to infections, therefore it is important to handle acne efficiently. Though there is no cure for acne, but acne is treatable. Advancement in the field of medicinal science, has given us a boon in the form of topical medications such as Retin-A, Renova, BenzaClin, and Tazorac as acne treatments. These skin care medications should be used on a doctor’s advice, as only a doctor can guide you with the correct usage and dosage in accordance to your acne condition.<br>  <br>  Retin-A is similar to Vitamin A which treats acne by unplugging the hair follicles and brings it on the surface of the skin. This phenomenon may make the acne look worsened. Its usual dosage is once a day before going to bed.<br>  <a href="http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/retin-a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/retin-...</a><br>  <br>  Renova is a topical form of Vitamin A which facilitates the skin to renew itself. Renova should be used in alliance with a complete skin care programme. Use Renova for only the prescribed period of time.<br>  <a href="http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/renova.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/renova...</a><br>  <br>  BenzaClin is a topical acne medication which constitutes two active constitutes benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin which are effectual acne fighters. It is usually applied twice a day on the acne affected area.<br>  <a href="http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/benzaclin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/benzac...</a><br>  <br>  Tazorac cream or gel can be used to treat both acne and psoriasis.

You can see visible results of acne treatment within a span of 4 weeks.<br>  <a href="http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/tazorac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlineskincaretips.com/tazora...</a>|`|9bd46ec4f2b23d3ec976f253a3e76a8aaa	Treatments Of Acne Scars<br>  <br>  <br>  Acne scars leave their mark not only on the skin but also on the persons' psyche. With rapid developments in dermatology, treating acne scars is becoming easier. Consult your dermatologist about the best treatment for your acne scars. The choice will depend upon your medical history, the type of scar and the treatments available for that type of scarring. Some treatments are cheaper but may not give the best results. The choice therefore also depends on your budget and the kind of results you desire. Read below for the kinds of treatments available for acne scars.<br>  <br>  Dermabrasion:<br>  This is considered one of the most effective treatments for acne scars. In this procedure, the doctor uses a local anesthetic or freezes the skin and then uses a high-speed rotary abrader to remove unwanted surface skin. As the skin heals, it shows a brighter appearance. This procedure may remove superficial scars totally and reduce deeper scars.<br>  <br>  Chemical Peeling:<br>  Depending on the scar, the doctor applies a mild chemical peel on the affected skin. This slowly peels away the old skin and fresh skin surfaces. Mild scars can be treated with chemical peels.<br>  <br>  Laser Therapy:<br>  Different lasers are used by the doctors to give a new shape to the scarred skin by recontouring the scars. The high burst of laser may make the skin red for some time.<br>  <br>  Soft Tissue Filling:<br>  Collagen, which may be bovine in source or the patients' own, may be injected below the scar to lift the skin and give it a smooth appearance. As the injected collagen gets absorbed in the body over a period, further treatments may be needed after about six months. Similarly fat may be injected below deep scars for giving a skin lift. Similar to collagen filling, fat injections may need to be repeated after some months. Your doctor will advise you about that.<br>  <br>  Skin Surgery:<br>  Skin may have to be surgically corrected with grafting or other procedures to remove some scars.<br>  <br>  Microdermabrasion:<br>  In this procedure. very tiny aluminum oxide crystals are passed through a vacuum tube to scrape the surface of the skin. This procedure may have to be repeated many times. It gives a fresh look to the skin by scraping. Very mild scarring can be treated with microdermabrasion.<br>  <br>  Note:<br>  For people who have the tendency to form keloids, no surgical method can be used. If one develops keloid with acne injury, more keloids will be formed by further surgery. Steroid injections may be used to treat keloids. In some cases, topical retinoic acid is applied directly on the keloids. <br>  more- <a href="http://www.doctorgoodskin.com/ds/acne/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doctorgoodskin.com/ds/acne/</a>|`|a01a909a2ff5b135d406b8f2f4e144c9aa	So much heavy answers to a simple question .U can use Momderm Cream Its very very effective cream in removing pimple and acne marks.|`|555aacece606d0f7ea1549bb7c53e250aa	Acne scar treatment<br>  <a href="http://acne-scar-tips.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://acne-scar-tips.blogspot.com/</a>|`|68a03a51da70fc23ce0da8ae87071d0baa	different country have different condition. <br>  better to consult skin doctor. <br>  i have this same result, i used to apply face wash, face massage, etc, better to exercise, it will reduce sugar consumption if u have large. thank u<br>  vishal|`|AA12309623	Both Expensive but I've heard micro dermabration works for some people and personally I really like Proactive Solutions.|`|bd3e96b025d443256b467b6760075559aa	how old r u, if u r below 25, no probs , it will cure .<br>  avoid out side foods, oily foods

92cf0a10908563ed193340675e66b918aa	Tru Noni by far!<br>  <br>  <br>  I am a “nutritional nut” I spend hours study nutritional companies and their products. I found most if not all companies that use independent distributors to distribute health drinks sell their products through Multi Level model and have high prices with lower level of the primary ingredient that they are advertising.<br>  <br>  For example, “aamie1” has a fabulous product for you to check out, something that he/she thinks is better than Noni. However, look at the company and it uses MLM model meaning that their price will be higher to pay the multiple levels of distributor. What is more, if you want to buy their product you must sign-up for “Auto-ship” and receive their product monthly. <br>  <br>  What you need to look at is the product ingredients. The company this distributor represents is “Vemma” and they sell a Mangosteen” juice blend for $60 per 32-ounce plastic bottle and its not even pure Mangosteen the very ingredient they propose to have healthful benefits. They recontute the fruit that translates into adding water.<br>  <br>  The same goes for TAHITIAN NONI, XANGO, and Himalayan Goji. All of them are MLM products and use a reconstituted version as their primary fruit.<br>  <br>  Tru Noni on the other hand is 100% pure Noni juice without water and other ingredients added for flavoring.

Even after the first time, most guys experience early ejaculation (or "premature ejaculation") once in a while, which means that they ejaculate before they want to. Up to 35 percent of men experience early ejaculation often enough that they see it as a problem. But usually, early ejaculation is not a continuing problem.<br>  <br>  Being very excited, fear and anxiety about sex, alcohol and drug use, and depression may cause early ejaculation. Open communication with a partner about likes and dislikes, and paying attention to sensation — to slow down the process of getting to the point of ejaculatory inevitability (when ejaculation can no longer be stopped) — during sex play can help guys delay ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Men who seek sex therapy for early ejaculation are taught the "squeeze technique." The partner brings the man to erection, but squeezes the penis just below the glans with thumb and forefinger just before the time when ejaculation would become inevitable. The partner applies pressure until the erection is reduced by 10-30 percent. The penis is released for about 30 seconds before it is brought to erection again. This procedure is repeated until the man can go for 15-20 minutes before ejaculating. When he can postpone ejaculation, he is allowed to have intercourse again.<br>  <br>  Other men have tried Extended Pleasure condoms by Trojan or Permorax condoms by Durex.

Well, two things. maybe three. First, masturbation. Take your time. Don't focus the whole thing on ejaculating. Feel yourself.<br>  Feel how good it feels. Try to stay hard longer, and just before you ejaculate, back off. Don't ejaculate right away. When it feels like you can get really into it again, do it until your thinking your there again and back off again. Let the orgasm build. When you want to ejaculate, do this; don't try to ejaculate fast. You want  toejaculate hard. So now that youv'e built yourself up, pump tight and steady while fighting it. You know your going to explode, be steady and let your dick explode for itself, not for you mind. As you get there, you can actually feel your penis swell even more as you have that orgasm. It's great. Then don't stop. Just like a woman wants in sex, just keep it in (at this time it would mean in your hands), and just revel in what just happened. Do this everytime you masturbate.<br>  Two is an excercise, and I don't remember what it's called, but excercise your penis. You know how when you need to pee and you squeeze to hold it in. I don't mean with your hand (HA-HA) but by itself? Whenever you think about it, wherever you are, do it a couple of times a second for thirty or so seconds at a time. It's like weight lifting. You strengthening you muscles there. This really is an excercise. I wish I could remember what it's called. Anyway it doesn't take long before you notice a difference.<br>  Three; when you get laid, practice the masturbating thing while your inside of her. You will have a mind blowing orgasm, and she'll love the more time you're inside of her.<br>  You know, there have been a few times where I let it go a little to long and some semen came out, but I slowed fast enough to stay hard until the real deal came along, and they thought I came twice when actually I came once. Not only did they think I was "all that", but because of it, they thought THEY were "all that" too.<br>  Good times for all!

4949fa321c98621186271445a114bf55aa	I'm sure you've been hearing since you were a kid "breakfast is the most important meal of the day"... well it is! Eating breakfast boosts your metabolism so that you can lose weight easier (breakfast alone doesn't make you lose weight, it just helps). But if you don't eat anything all day it *slows down* your metabolism and makes you GAIN weight (believe it or not). Think poor people in Ethiopia: know how they are starving but have huge bellies? That's because when they DO eat since their metabolism is so slow, they retain every single calorie and carb they eat. And you don't want to do that.<br>  <br>  *Eat HEALTHY and you will lose weight. Eat NOTHING and you will GAIN weight from everything you eat.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, if you want to lose weight, DO NOT skip breakfast. Eat something high in protein and carbs (like cereal) and it will kick start your metabolism for the rest of the day. Plus you're less likely to overeat at lunch or dinner since you'll be starving by then. And you'll also have less of an impulse to eat candy and stuff between meals.<br>  <br>  So remember: Not eating = gaining weight (sounds like it defies the laws of humanity, but it's true. Not eating kills your metabolism and hurts your body).|`|T27VL2ujaa	breakfast kick starts your metabolism that's why you shouldn't skip it...it also prevents you from binging later...if u skip a meal you're at a higher risk of over-eating later..also don't stop eating you will not lose weight and once you get to a "satisfying" weight you will most likely gain it back if you start eating again..trust me, i know<br>  to lose weight just eat smaller meals more protein and complex carbs|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	Breakfast speeds up your metabalism for the day.

In the morning your body has already been fasting since the last time you ate dinner or whatever your last meal was.  So, that is around 8-12 hours ago, therefore making breakfast the most important meal and keeping your body out of starvation mode.  Hence, lossing bad weight keeping good weight such as muscle mass (big or small everyone needs them).  That is why it is called breakfast = break fast.  Now if you just want to stop eating yes you will see results but you will be the same body type and body fat % since you have made your body go into starvation mode making it first break down all you muscle tissue to provide your body with nutrients to survive!   Very bad misstake here b/c muscle is the only thing that burns fat.  <br>  <br>  So you have to ask yourself this question, do you want to be fit a beautiful with a low body fat %, or do you want to be a waste of skin, subquitainous fat, and bones? Personally, i think that main stream society thinks a "good looking" person is someone who takes care of their body and is at a healthy weight and size (this includes body fat %)|`|zjDgy6Xwaa	eat fresh orange, lemon, lime, or grapefruit juice all day for a week... or eat nothing and only drink herbal laxative tea... it works great|`|17orTrcRaa	The reason they are saying that is because most people can't do what you said...not eat anything all day...at least not for very many days.  In fact, when they start their day by saying: "I'm not going to eat anything today", by afternoon and evening they are understandably very hungry, so they eat and eat to make up for not having had any breakfast or even lunch.  Then they eat more than they would have if they hadn't been so starved from not eating breakfast.<br>  <br>  So it's best to ward off the severe late day hunger that makes a person overeat by eating a nice little breakfast.

You need to eat steadily throughout the day and NEVER skip a meal.|`|eb055b29c878c5655f8c4693b3a7d0aeaa	having breakfast starts your metabolism so that you can start burning calories.  Your metabolism slows down to an almost stopped mode when you sleep (because it doens't take energy to sleep) however once that happens it does not start up again until you give it food and tell it to wake up and start going again.  if you wait until lunch time to eat then you are wasting 3-4 hrs (depends when u get up) of time that you can burn calories doing nothing...meaning you will not burn as many calories as you can in a day.  if you don't eat breakfast you actually end up having to eat less food in a day because you are not burning enough calories as you are taking in....EAT BREAKFAST! no matter what other people tell you, science has proven that one!

Buddhist Philosophy and Buddhist psychology offers more than a method of investigation. Its core techniques of meditation, mindfulness and awareness may have much to offer ordinary Westerners, whose material comforts have not wiped out rampant emotional distress. To most people Buddhism is an ancient Asian religion, although a very special one. It has no god, it has no central creed or dogma and its primary goal is the expansion of consciousness, or awareness. But to the 14th Dalai Lama, it's a highly refined tradition, perfected over the course of 2,500 years, of analyzing and investigating the inner world of the mind in order to transform mental states and promote happiness. "Whether you are a believer or not in the faith," the 14th Dalai Lama recently told a conference of Buddhists and scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, you can use its time-honored techniques to voluntarily control your emotional state. Yes, the 14th Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of over 580 million  buddhists worldwide. Yes, he is also the head of the Tibetan government in exile. But in the spirit of Buddhism the Dalai Lama has an inquiring mind and wishes to expand human knowledge to improve lives. At its core, Buddhism is a system of inquiry into the nature of what is. He believes that psychology and neuroscience have gone as far as they can go in understanding the mind and brain by measuring external reality. Now that inner reality--the nature of consciousness--is the pressing subject du jour, the sciences need to borrow from the knowledge base that Buddhism has long cultivated. A comprehensive science of the mind requires a science of consciousness. Buddhism offers what MIT geneticist Eric Lander, Ph.D., called a "highly refined technology" of introspective practices that provide systematic access to subjective experience. Yet Buddhist psychology offers more than a method of investigation. Its core techniques of meditation and awareness may have much to offer ordinary Westerners, whose material comforts have not wiped out rampant emotional distress. Over the past 25 years, starting with his own personal interest, the 14th Dalai Lama has set up discussions with Western scientists in an effort to further knowledge about the emotions. The recent meeting, held at MIT, was actually the eleventh in a series of annual conversations sponsored by the Colorado-based Mind & Life Institute. But it was the first one that was open to other participants. The Buddhist view of how the mind works is somewhat different from the traditional Western view. Western psychology holds to the belief that things like attention and emotion are fixed and immutable. Buddhism sees the components of the mind more as skills that can be trained.  This view has increasing support from modern neuroscience, which is daily providing new evidence of the brain's capacity for change and growth! “Buddhism uses intelligence to control the emotions. Through meditative practices, such as mindfulness of breathing, loving-kindness meditation, and insight meditation, awareness can be trained and focused on the contents of the mind to observe ongoing experience. Such techniques are of a fast growing interest to Western psychiatrists, psychologists, and cognitive behavioral therapists, who increasingly see depression as a disorder of emotional mismanagement. In this view, attention is hijacked by negative events and then sets off a kind of chain reaction of negative feeling, thinking and behavior that has its own rapidity and inevitability. Techniques of awareness permit the cultivation of self-control. They allow people to break the negative emotional chain reaction and head off the hopelessness and despair it leads to. By focusing attention, it is possible to monitor your environment, recognize a negative stimulus and act on it the instant it registers on awareness. While attention as traditional psychologists know it can be an exhausting mental activity, as Buddhists practice it it actually becomes a relaxing and effortless enterprise. One way of meditation is to use breathing techniques in which you focus on the breathing and let any negative stimulus just go by--instead of bringing it into your working memory, where you are likely to sit and ruminate about it and thus amplify its negativity. It's a way of unlearning the self-defeating ways you somehow acquired of responding catastrophically to negative experiences. Evidence increasingly suggests that meditation techniques are highly effective at helping people recover from of depression and especially very useful in preventing recurrences. Medication may be needed during the depths of an acute episode to jump-start brain systems, but at best "antidepressants are a halfway house," says Dr. Alan Wallace PhD.  When you have identified your major problem through meditation, whatever the problem is that is bothering you terribly, you should then sit there, relax, and call up this emotion in your meditation. Whether it is anger, jealousy, pride, envy, greed, loneliness, depression, anxiety, summon it here. Look at the essence of this emotion that makes you suffer so much. The mind is the root of all our experiences, for others and for us. If we perceive the world in an unclear way, confusion and suffering will surely arise! It is like someone with defective vision seeing the world as being upside down, or a fearful person finding everything frightening. We may be largely unaware of our ignorance and wrong views, yet present the mind it can be compared to a wild tiger, rampaging through our daily lives. Motivated by desire, hatred and bewilderment this untamed mind blindly pursues what it wants and lashes out at all that stands in its way, with little or no understanding of the way things really are.  Mindfulness meditation helps us see things, people, situations, clearly – as they really are.  The wildness we have to deal with is not simply that of anger and rage; it is much more fundamental than that. The tendency to be driven by ignorance, anger, hatred, and greed enslaves us, allowing confusion and negative emotions to predominate. Thus the mind becomes wild and uncontrollable and our freedom is effectively destroyed. Normally we are so blind that we are unaware of how wild our minds really are. When things go wrong we tend to blame other people and circumstances, rather than look inside ourselves for the causes of the suffering. But if we are ever to find true peace or happiness it is that wildness within which must be faced and dealt with. Only then can we learn to use our energy in a more positive and balanced way, so that we stop causing harm to ourselves and to others. The meditative techniques of Mindfulness of Breathing, Insight Meditation and Loving-kindness Meditation greatly aids us in curing depression, anxieties, anger, rage, hatred, greed, and creates Optimism within.<br>  Excellent Beginner’s Books to read and practice are:  (1) “The Beginner’s Guide To Insight Meditation” {This is a most Excellent book to get started with, providing a very Positive, Optimistic View)  By:  Arinna Weisman & Jean Smith.

It is a mental illness that manifests with low mood, low self-worth, sadness, lack of interest in everyday activities, feelings of guilt or worry, disturbed sleep and appetite, as well as poor concentration.<br>  Depression can be triggered by a tragic event or can occur unprompted. It is highly correlated with decreased levels of activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, particularly on the left side.<br>  Medications can be very helpful for people suffering from depression.  There are many many anti-depressants on the market.  Some newer ones are "cymbalta" which works on increasing the serotonin and norepinephrine (great for pain reduction also)  "Effexor" similar to cymbalta but doesn't have as much of a pain reduction effect.  "Lexapro" only works on serotonin but is a very effective medication.   Then there are old ones like Prozac and Paxil etc... I would recommend using the newer drugs because they have less side effects and newer drugs have to go through much stricter guidelines to get on the market then the older drugs did (making them typically safer and more effective)  <br>  I hope that information helps and I hope you or your friend can find relief from this difficult disease!|`|9c0db29a314c52f99f0c280f948a691aaa	Depression is rage and anger turned inward !!!   aproach with caution and with lots of sensitivity....|`|AA10435311	depression could be a biochemical condition of too little seratonin or it could be environmental where they have not been happy for whatever reason for quite some time. you have to be patient and caring with such people, long term serious depression can lead eventually to suicide. help them get help for themselves as they often arent able or are unwilling to do it for themselves.|`|h9OIvdVmaa	Symptoms:<br>  <br>  You feel miserable and sad.<br>  You feel exhausted a lot of the time with no energy .<br>  You feel as if even the smallest tasks are sometimes impossible.<br>  You seldom enjoy the things that you used to enjoy-you may be off sex or food or may 'comfort eat' to excess.<br>  You feel very anxious sometimes.<br>  You don't want to see people or are scared to be left alone.

There are two ways to apply it, one is to soak the forefoot entirely in the liquid, the other is to apply it by using a cheap plastic pipette found in pharmacy for eyedropper and apply drops to keep the site moist for the duration. The first method works well when the affected area is large, but the downside is the liquid is quite acidic and can irritate the skin (thus you don't want to soak it too long). The second method works best when used on toenails.<br>  <br>  Of course there are quite a number of other remedies all based on the principle of acidity or antiseptic.

b4471c0dc1a0b131f920d608f2ade38aaa	Yes, I can. <br>  <br>  Read my articles then act on it.<br>  **************************************<br>  Life Style Change Program for Loosing Weight  <br>  By <br>  minootoo <br>  <br>  Who needs to loose weight?<br>  <br>  Answer is simply not every one, only the over weight person.<br>  <br>  Who is over weight?<br>  <br>  This is simple, it is easy to find out and it is available on line, it is call Bio Mass Index, and calculations are simple. According to this calculation if you find your self say only 10 pounds more, you may not be over weight. Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.<br>   <br>  What is the reason for being over weight?<br>  <br>  This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI. <br>   <br>  Basic understanding of loosing weight. <br>  <br>  Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.<br>  <br>  Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.<br>  <br>  What is a healthy weight loss?<br>  <br>  When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  How much is one pound of body fat?<br>  <br>  One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.  <br>  <br>  How many pounds should a person loose in a month?<br>  <br>  Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.<br>  <br>  This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.<br>  <br>  <br>  When an overweight person should start loosing weight?<br>   <br>  At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.<br>  <br>  How does body react to weight lose?<br>  <br>  Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.<br>  <br>  What is the relationship between body and body fat?<br>  <br>  Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.<br>  <br>  What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?<br>  <br>  This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per hour and walk burns 100 calories per hour approximately. <br>  <br>  What is the importance of body fat for a female?<br>  <br>  Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet. <br>  <br>  At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of water (zero calories).<br>  Calories should be accounted for all other liquids.<br>  <br>  Why water?<br>  <br>  Water is a universal solvent, means it dissolves almost every thing at least in very minute quantities. This helps purification of body.<br>  <br>  Eat <br>  <br>  What should be your proportionate in take of fat, Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates? <br>  <br>  This depends on what your need are.<br>  <br>  1. Need to reduce fat.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 30 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 60 percent of 1500 calories per day = 900 calories.<br>         <br>  2. Need more energy.<br>        <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 40 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>         <br>  3. Need to reduce weight only.<br>  <br>  Fat: 25 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 375 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 25 percent of 1500 calories per day = 375 calories.<br>  Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.<br>  <br>  4. Need to increase muscles bulk, but still reduce weight.<br>  <br>  Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.<br>  Complex Carbohydrates: 15 percent of 1500 calories per day = 225 calories.<br>  Proteins: 75 percent of 1500 calories per day = 1125 calories.<br>  Exercise the muscles you want to develop, you can find right exercise on line, recommend use of light weights.<br>  <br>  Foot note: To take fat is so important, while reducing even fat, that it is included in all cases. If the fat is completely cut out, body will think of producing the fat, and will produce the fat by reducing metabolism, without fat in take, you may actually again weight even at lower than 1500 calorie level. You will feel run down and lethargic.<br>  <br>  How one must, drink and eat?<br>  <br>  Drink<br>  <br>  Every one may not be able to follow this regime.<br>  <br>  A 16 oz glass of water fist thing in the morning will be very healthy start. <br>  If you need to stabilize your stomach before eating, you can have a glass of water just before each and every meal. This is the easiest way to meet your quota of gallon of liquids.<br>  <br>  Eat<br>  <br>  To day almost half the world is starving. <br>  <br>  In western culture. Standard healthy practice for long time was three warm square meals per day. No eating in between, but children were allowed night cap.<br>  <br>  All that has changed, present thinking is 5 to 6 times per day. Any way what practice one follows is up to them; to each his own.<br>  <br>  Another best practice will be a glass of water before bed time, nothing to eat for two hours before bed time.<br>  <br>  How do I know the calorie count for various drinks and food?<br>  <br>  If you are buying packaged items it is on the package.<br>  <br>  Go on the internet and find the calorie information.<br>  <br>  Lots of cook book now a days list calorie per serving.<br>  Use your best guess, in this method use higher figure then you have guessed.<br>  <br>  References:<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv1-mdp&p=Calories+chart">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.halls.md/body-mass-index/bmi....</a><br>  *************************<br>  Body Building<br>  BY<br>  minootoo<br>  <br>  You are blessed.<br>  <br>  How old are you?<br>  <br>  Most people put on weight after age 40.<br>  <br>  Any way before you try any thing, see a doctor to rule out any abnormalities (Hormone, Pituitary).<br>  <br>  Remember it is ten times easier to put on the weight then to take it off.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Body building is opposite of weight loss.

I know at least three people who have had it done, and aside from a little variation in their immediate recovery, they seem to be quite happy with it in the long run. Any surgery carries some risk, so do your research and be sure you are okay with it and are going with a reputable doctor.  If your glasses are falling off, you just need to get them fitted better. They should stay on for all of the things you mentioned. Talk to your eye doctor about all of this.|`|CuW5mveJaa	It is surgery...but the procedure is so short a few minutes the most per eye..you are in and out of there..There has been alot of advances in that field out there, and it is quite common for people..I hear you,glasses fog up when you cook, they break if you want those fancy frames..(my hubby has his currently all taped together just so he can see..) and contacts are expensive and a pain to keep clean and take care of.<br>  As far as a risk with lasik like with any surgery there will be some risks involved..so go to a reputable doc..don't go to someone just because he is cheap..I mean we are talking your eyesight here.<br>  A good place to start is to ask someone first who had it done,who had good results and experience..I think most of the risks are going to be after the actual surgery..making sure you keeping your eyes protected until they can fully heal..

5187cbf58d5d7f3ab2abca726b610e21aa	Antibiotic use provides the selection pressure necessary for drug-resistant microbes to evolve. However, encouraging proper use of antimicrobials will slow the evolution of resistance. This means using the narrowest-spectrum antibiotic available, finishing the entire course of all antibiotic regimens, prescribing antibiotics only when they are necessary (i.e. not for viral infections, a practice that is all too common), using multiple drug therapy when warranted (tuberculosis and HIV come to mind, among others), etc.<br>  <br>  And yes, clearly, "superbugs" present a danger to future health - step into any hospital and take look at the issues caused by bugs like MRSA and VRE, and multi-drug resistant TB. We walk a delicate line between preventing morbidity and mortality with drugs now and promoting antibiotic resistance for the future. Dutifully sticking to the principles above (and additional measures) will help minimize the risk of superbug development and spread.|`|3a37c6d3eb9e914f155df7ad545276f4aa	I am an RN.  Unfortunately many people with an ordinary cold go to the Dr.and are handed a prescription for an antibiotic even though the cold will clear up on its own.  Some pediatricians give antibiotic for ear infections even though the medical literature says they can generally clear up on their own.  Unfortunately we live in a "I need it now" society where we don't want to wait for natures own healing.  Everyone wants a pill and most Dr's comply.<br>  <br>  Everybody has staph on their skin.  It is a normal body flora.  Unfortunately the over use of prescriptions have caused a simple staph infection into a lifethreatening problem for some groups of people like the eldery and young and those with a weakend immune system. These people can develope MRSA (methacillin resistant staph areueas)  This can require weeks (6 or more) of IVantibiotics (usually vancomycin).  These bugs are now starting to mutate and not even respond to vanco. Stronger antibiotics are needed and are being developed as we speak.  Sometimes MRSA requires a combination of drugs like Gentamycin and Vanco.<br>  <br>  My advise is to stay away from antibiotics unless you really need them.  I have a chronic lung disease and get pneumonia at least 1-2 x a year.  I am allergic to 4 classes of antibiotics.  My Dr. and I have worked it out that unless I continue to get worse with time we will then start antibiotics.  Ketek which is used specifficaly for pneumonia has now been linked with liver faiure.  Why would I want to risk that for something that may clear with time?|`|23abf31dcf10dbde59c5382487cf9395aa	Doctors are overprescibing anti biotics and they say thats why our flus and everything are getting worse.|`|d84380296b9a8f9858c5a99d1918e463aa	The antibiotics that we use today will be ineffective in the future.  Viruses and bacteria have a faster evolution rate.  Another problem is over prescribing for illnesses in which there is no medication and people not completing their regime of medication, actually stopping when they feel better within a day or two.  These people then pass their unused medications to a friend or relative for the some illness.  This is viscous cycle and the winner's are the viruses and bacteria.  Everything wants to live we evolve to survive in our environment.|`|ea96ffd32e93cfdf652f20abea901970aa	Very interesting question.<br>  <br>  Antibiotics are very helpful in our modern world of medicine today. Many people's lives have been saved because of the correct use of antibiotics. Not using antibiotics would be murder to many people around the world who may be sick or ill. Imagine if someone you loved dearly was sick and a simple pill or liquid form of medicine could easily cure the disease. What would you do if the doctor came in and said that they couldn't give antibiotics because of the future risk of them and that your loved one was more than likely going to die because the lack of antibiotics. Doctors and trained professionals are always working to provide the people of the world with new antibiotics to stop super bugs in the future. To cure many more people and save many more lives. No matter what is done in the medical field there will always be many risk. Using antibiotics is just like doing anything else to heal someone. It will have risk but what you have to think about is do the possible risk of using antibiotics out weigh all the lives we can save by putting them into practice? <br>  <br>  However, in the future-preparing world we live in today many people haven't thought about the possible affects that antibiotics are having on our society and future lives. Using antibiotics now could endanger the rest of our population. By taking the simple way out by using these pills and liquid forms is doing nothing but slowly killing our own race and own kind. Imagine somewhere (possibly very near) in the future your great grandchild being killed by a super bug because the scienctist are doing an unefficient job of creating new medicines to stop the super bugs. Its time to face the facts- our scientist aren't prepared to deal with a super bug and our world can't defend against one. Why don't we start preparing for that bug now by stoping the use of anitbiotics. The whole nation or possibly world could be wiped out because of our simple use of antibiotics. Is saving lives now worth wiping out the whole world in the future. Maybe you are saving SOME people but in the end using antibiotics is only shooting ourselves in the foot.|`|fc4b7407ee3944042f92acc9f5f067b8aa	First off let me say, Im writing by thought, and so it may not make total sense what Im saying but I hope to make my point understood.<br>  <br>  It makes perfect sense that we have been on this planet for thousands of years, before there were manufactured antibiotics.<br>  <br>  Our body, creates its own antibodies against bacterial infections. (this is where the whole idea behind the use of vaccinations.)<br>  <br>  When we take antiboitics it not only kills the bacteria causing illness, but it also kills are own healthy cells which are the cells that learn to kill bad bacteria.<br>  <br>  The more we take antibiotics, the more we kill our own own defense system.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, many people who take prescribed antibiotics typically dont finish the entire bottle, which leave bad bacteria to survive and hang around, which mutate and grown stronger than the antibio itself.<br>  <br>  Additionally, people think that taking antibiotics help viral infections as well, which actually doesnt do anything, except let any bad bacteria in your body get used to the antibiotics (and kill your own defensive system), . This makes them grow stronger than your own immune system.<br>  <br>  Many people dont realize the everyday food they ingest, that actually have antibiotics in them, that over time can compromise their immune system.<br>  <br>  Things like milk, and meats... These animals are treated with antibiotics for utter infections etc. This gets in your food/milk and you ingest small doses of antibios which again kills your immune system little by little, and allows bad bacteria in small doses sitting in your body to gain a tolerance to the antibios.<br>  <br>  Obviously I would recommend injesting meats and milks that are organic and never treated with antibios.
562f4138e50ae63d2d7809f630c09281aa	Well the major pros and cons of antibiotics are that yes, they are helpful in curing infections. But the majority of patients taking them do not take the full course as instructed, thus the infection is not fully killed. So the bacteria become resistant to it. The only way to end the "superbugs" and stop formation of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA and VRE is to find something else to use besides antibiotics. But this is not a feasible option because of their great benefits.

USUALLY THERE MAY BE SMALL SPRINGS PROTRUDING THAT HOOK AROUND THE TWO TEETH OR THE WIRE THAT GOES ACROSS THE FRONT TEETH IS ACTIVE I.E IT IS KINDA TIGHT OR WILL BE TIGHTENED.

They retain(ers) the current position of your teeth.<br>  <br>  I have invisalign right now...as a college student I felt a little old to be in standard braces. They are incredibly expensive normally, but if the gap is minor enough (taking 6 months or less to fix) you can do something called "invisalign express" which is like 1/4th the price, even cheaper than normal braces. I signed up for this plan.<br>  <br>  Ask your orthodontist if the express plan could work for your situation, good luck!

If ot is negative, get the series.  <br>  If you have had the Hep B series at least once, get your antibody checked.

It does not protect you for life. In fact you probably had very little protection from it. Most people who have TB have had a BCG. You can have a ppd skin test (Mantoux) if you have had a BCG, and if the Mantoux test is positive it means you either have some immunity to TB or you have latent TB. In order to know the difference you need to have either a Quantiferon Gold blood test or a Elispot (T-Spot) blood test. Both of which are considered almost 100% reliable. The T-Spot more so if you are HIV positive.

I know it sucks but it's the truth.<br>  Before taking any drug you should really research what effects the chemicals will have on your body. The risks may be higher then the benefits. Also start eliminating stuff from your diet that you don't REALLY need to have. I would have a Grande Mocha from Starbucks every morning! That's 2000 cal a week. not to mention the fast food at lunch time and a can of soda mid afternoon. It all adds up and does the damage over time on your waist line.

Y4ZcAnpuaa	I too have tried what seems like everything.  Accutane is about the only thing I HAVEN'T tried.  I have finally found what does work for me though...<br>  <br>  For washing, Neutrogena Gentle Face wash with a fresh washcloth works well. Without the cloth it doesn't quite manage makeup removal. Just make sure to get white washcloths and wash in hot water with a bit of bleach if possible and use a fresh cloth every time you wash.  It doesn't irritate, dry out, burn or anything else.  I use baby wipes to remove eye makeup.<br>  <br>  I found Paula's Choice online and started using her 2.5% benzoil peroxide every morning and evening. I alternate the 2%BHA with the 8% AHA in the evenings. I use the 2%BHA in the morning after the BP. They have sample sizes of stuff available for next to nothing. <br>  <br>  When it's a bad time of month for my skin, making an aspirin facial helps out. Make a thick paste out of 5-6 aspirin and add a tablespoon of honey. Leave it on for 10-15 minutes and rinse off. <br>  <br>  I still get spots during those bad times but it is still much better than it was, even with the drs. help. And, I'm not popping pills or using medications that did more to irritate my skin than anything else. My skin doesn't hurt or burn anymore and the spots I do have are pretty easily covered with makeup.

I used to have the worst acne imaginable and I tried everythign under the sun to correct it.  The best over the counter product that worked for me was just washing my face with Neutrogena Daily Face Wash.  It is in a clear bottle and looks like Dial Orange colored soap.  And then on my acne I dipped a cotten ball in Witch Hazel that stinks awful on each zit and that was it.  I did this every evening and over night my pimples seemed to shrink right away.  This is what a good dermatologist recommended after I tried Proactive and clearsil and Oxy and all those other products.....Neutrogena Daily Face Wash and then Witch Hazel on the acne.   Remember don't overwash your face.  My doctor said I was washing to many times a day.  Once a day wash your face when you have acne and then when it is gone twice a day.  The doctor recommended once a day when you have acne because your skin secrets natural oils that are suppossed to counteract acne and bacteria as a natural defense if you wash you face to many times the face stays dry and the natural oils can't go to work for you trying to kill bacteria and the acne.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!
AA12308795	Stress is the #1 cause of weight gain. The stress of counting calories or eating less than you want, makes you fatter due to the stress. Nourish your body thin, instead of starving your body fat. Good carbs like celery and carrots will never make you fat. Bad carbs like cake will, but you don't need to know the whole science of glycemic load. You need to re-learn how to eat so you can become thin and healthy. Salt has no calories but makes you fat and burning more calories does not help this fatness.<br>  <br>  Find out about fastest way to lose weight, most effective exercise, good and bad fats, water retention and secret trick used by models to flatten their tummy before an event. Reading a book will take you hours but the information on a post, taking minutes to read, is not enough. The webpage below has just enough to know what you need to know. Links page has gov. BMI calculator to find out just how much overweight you are (teens plug in your age to compare to others your age).<br>  <br>  You can force your body to lose weight with not enough calories, but if you continue it, you will starve to death. With an abundance of super healthy foods, you lose weight just as fast, but only until you reach your ideal weight. You can continue eating this way the rest of your life and always be at your ideal weight.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.phifoundation.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.phifoundation.org</a>|`|24e3847bc61586b141205dd8719ee9f6aa	yes|`|6af08417dc9d86a96075aff0d5bb6ee8aa	did not read the article, but stress effects our bodies in very unhealthy ways sometimes...such as over eating (gaining weight) under eating which could lead to anorexia and heart attacks, high blood pressure, etc...<br>  bottom line:  stress is not good for the body<br>  <br>  be cool...|`|boCqM2roaa	yes very much as the basic metabolism of the body loses the balance.|`|rJYhPxKGaa	oh, yes.<br>  it's true.<br>  <br>  see it for yourself using my calculator:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cutepiggy.com/bmi_calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.cutepiggy.com/bmi_calculator</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cutepiggy.com/hoodia" rel="nofollow">http://www.cutepiggy.com/hoodia</a>|`|AA12198711	It has been proven to do just that!|`|tUW0A9iPaa	it can or make u lose also.

a9a9d5717b6166b5ee85825b466d2beaaa	I discovered the cause of certain bouts of anxiety and panic of my own--improper breathing.  Many people report feeling like they are having a heart attack; well I always panic based on feeling like I've lost all my breath in my lungs.  I discovered this brief shortness of breath was causing full-fledged panic attacks, so what I have learned to do is stop, take some very slow, very full deep breaths until I get that one breath that "catches" a good full feeling of inhaling, and once I catch that breath, I calm down.  This tendency to panic has improved a great deal since I started swimming, which has improved my lung capacity and deep breathing immensely in general.  Make sure that you're always breathing deeply, deep down into your lungs and diaphram.  I bet when you get anxious you're taking short, shallow breaths and don't even realize it.<br>  <br>  As for your job, yes, it can trigger what I believe to be the "tense" breathing I've described.  Many people don't realize that it's the slightest physical things that can cause panic initially.  Your job is likely the indirect cause of the tension, so yes, improving your work situation should help as well.  My advice was more based on the reality of the moment of panic at hand.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  PS:  Ignore the "schizophrenia" diagnosis.  That person is posting that response to multiple questions.|`|Jzwxtchdaa	I am a trained Psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  From what you describe, I have a pretty good idea that what you are suffering from is Schizophrenia and possibly Bipolar II.<br>  <br>  You have a chemical imbalance that needs to be corrected. You have elevated seratonin and dopamine levels. That is what is making you act this way. <br>  <br>  You need to see a psychiatrist immediatly. Ask him to put you on Respiridone and Lithium. <br>  Once you are properly diagnosed you need to inform the motor vehicle branch and let them know that you are potentialy a dangerous driver because of a mental illness.<br>  <br>  Trust me... I have been doing this for 25 years. I know schizophrenia when I see schizophrenia and I am sorry to say.... you have it! <br>  <br>  You may need to spend a few weeks in a mental hospital.

b3744dd4a795abd63d4af59757c0d223aa	Variety is the most important thing in muscle growth.  Our bodies are so good at adapting that by the third day you do the same exercise routine you are mostly adapted.<br>  <br>  So try variations like barbells with different grips, cables and other curl machines.<br>  <br>  The other important thing for growth is the intensity of your training.  A few high quality sets are better than a lot of lazy sets.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you need to train both fast twitch and slow twitch muscle fibres.  So you need to vary the speed at which you do reps.  Also try partial reps and negative reps to force contractions at different parts of the motion.<br>  <br>  Finally, use a good protein powder and multi-vitamin to ensure your muscles have the nutrients needed to build up.<br>  <br>  For curls guys should able to do at least half their body weight, so you're pretty close to that.|`|8TjV3Y9Daa	Although there are different ways for different people, there are a few rules that I follow.  First thing is to do different bicep exercises in different workouts so that your biceps do not get used to any single exercise.  Also, doing heavy weights at lower reps can be effective for building strength and size.  A couple of particularly good exercises are reverse-grip curls, standing or preacher, and hammer grip curls.  I dedicate an entire day to solely to arms (tri's, bi's, and forearms) and my bicep workout usually consists of standing barbell curls, one-arm preacher curls, incline dumbbell curls, and hammer curls.  Be sure to allow enough rest time and don't overtrain!

Don't know whether or not that's true but it sure tastes great!|`|gSZeWk0Aaa	You many not get all of the benefits you want from the green tea if you are drinking it iced.

Don't know why though.<br>  <br>  I can tell you too, that I drink green tea.  When I first started drinking it (hot) I lost 10 lbs and didn't change anything I was doing.  So you may potentially have weight loss benefits doing this.  Honey is good for you too!|`|YDsNEQZMaa	your doing a great job buy working out, keep it up, i know about this other green tea it's hot and you drink it hot and it makes you go to the bathroom allot. so make sure your home but yea don't put honey to your tea. its called Chinese green tea. good luck.|`|aQrXEOHDaa	Ofcoure not! green tea is very sanitary and its cood too!

2dc006a42562a30df7d3cddb9f97474aaa	Hi, first time I read about this.  I also have one behind my right knee, had it for some 12 years now.  I saw a specialist about it, as a matter of fact he was the one to do that kind of surgery.  He told me if he was me he would not get the operation because when it comes to your knee, after such a surgery your knee will never be the same, you will always have pain and problems, that as long as it did not bother me, to just leave it as it.  It's not cancerous either.  So today I still have it.  It has not grown any larger and is not really bothering me as sometimes I forget I have it until I bend my knee.  Other than that, we are happy together.  Good luck on your decision.  As to what it is, it was explained to me but I am sorry, I forgot but I am sure you can fine something on the Internet about it.  I never searched.|`|3YPqMAvraa	If you go to an orthopedic surgeon, they will always recommend removing it.  That is how a surgeon makes his money.  Bakers cysts are harmless.  If you can deal with the pain, just leave it alone. Bakers cysts are harmless.
fWYXZtwuaa	There are many causes of dark circles, from age, heredity, allergies, cold or sinus infection, bone structure and glasses which are not so commonly known.  <br>  <a href="http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2006/11/27/causes-of-dark-circles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2006/11...</a><br>  <br>  If you would like to apply home remedies to reduce dark circles, here are some of my suggestions:<br>  Buy a box of regular, old fashioned unflavored gelatin (e.g. Knox) from grocery store. Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.<br>  <a href="http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01/01/special-spa-home-remedy-to-reduce-dark-circles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01...</a>|`|b6aaa773b618b17dac9f26ca4a48e819aa	The dark circles under your eyes are due to the lack of water.  The optimum amount of water to drink is 1 ounce per pound of body weight, the least is 1/2 ounce.|`|AA10697205	Ditch the Dark Circles<br>  Before you go to bed, peel and slice a potato. Close your eyes and cover your eyelids with slices of raw potato, using a bandanna to secure the potatoes while you sleep. Do this three times a week. You should start to see gradual improvement. <br>  How it works: The potatoes have the same enzyme used in expensive cosmetic creams to lighten the skin. <br>  <br>  You can also mix equal portions of almond oil and honey and massage the mixture into the dark circles around your eyes before going to bed. Wash it off in the morning. <br>  How it works: The honey acts as a moisturizer. The oil gently exfoliates, stimulating the skin cells around the eyes. This tightens and eventually lightens loose skin around the eyes. It has the dual effect of getting rid of wrinkles around the eyes, too.|`|fHSujQ8Haa	Use multivitamines and vit A and skin moisureriser.

The first thing is are you stretching before you exercise?  This is so important even if you are "just" power walking.  It is your body's way to prepare your muscles before exercise.

Make sure that even though you are eating healthy you are taking a daily mulit-vitamin.  Your potassium might be low.

AA11850523	Complications of mumps are potentially serious, but rare. These include:<br>  <br>      * Orchitis. This inflammatory condition causes swelling of one or both testicles. Orchitis is painful, but it rarely leads to sterility — the inability to father a child.<br>      * Pancreatitis. This is swelling of the pancreas. Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and vomiting.<br>      * Encephalitis. A viral infection, such as mumps, can lead to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Encephalitis can lead to neurologic problems and become life-threatening. Although it's serious, encephalitis is a rare complication of mumps.<br>      * Meningitis. Meningitis is infection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord. It can occur if the mumps virus spreads through your bloodstream to infect your central nervous system. Like encephalitis, meningitis is a rare complication of mumps.<br>      * Inflammation of the ovaries. Pain in the lower abdomen in women may be a symptom of this problem. Fertility doesn't seem to be affected.<br>      * Hearing loss. In rare cases, mumps can cause hearing loss, usually permanent, in one or both ears.|`|AA11511873	Deafness can occurr w/ Mumps.....websites below should be particularly helpful in your search.  Good luck....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mumps - Topic Overview<br>  What is mumps?<br>  <br>  Mumps is a contagious viral infection that can cause painful swelling of the parotid glands, which are the salivary glands located between the ear and the jaw.<br>  What causes mumps?<br>  <br>  Mumps is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, as well as through contact with recently contaminated items such as tissues, drinking glasses, and dirty hands.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  Mumps can affect many body systems and cause flu-like symptoms, abdominal pain, swollen cheeks, and swollen and painful testicles. However, up to 20% of people who are infected with the mumps virus do not have any symptoms.1<br>  <br>  The incubation period-the time from when a person is first infected with the virus until the first symptoms develop-is usually 16 to 18 days, although it can be as long as 25 days. Usually, infected people are contagious a day or two before the first symptoms appear, although they can spread the virus any time from 7 days before to 9 days after symptoms appear.<br>  How is mumps diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Mumps is most often diagnosed by a history of exposure to the disease, the presence of swelling and tenderness of the parotid glands, and other symptoms, including neck stiffness, headache, and painful testicles.<br>  <br>  If needed, blood tests, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, EIA), can be done to confirm the diagnosis and eliminate the possibility that another illness is causing the symptoms.<br>  <br>  The mumps virus itself can be identified with a viral culture of samples of urine, saliva, or cerebrospinal fluid obtained by a lumbar puncture.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  In most cases, people recover from mumps with rest and care at home. In complicated cases, hospitalization may be required.<br>  Can mumps be prevented?<br>  <br>  Mumps can almost always be prevented by getting a series of injections with the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first MMR injection usually is given around 12 to 15 months of age. Most babies do not become infected with mumps during their first year of life because of the temporary immunity they acquired from their mothers during fetal development.<br>  <br>  Before researchers developed the mumps vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease in the United States. Now, thanks to widespread immunization programs, the number of cases has dropped steadily. In 2002, only 270 cases were reported.2<br>  <br>  *******<br>    Description<br>  <br>      An acute viral illness caused by the mumps virus.<br>  <br>   <br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>      Fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite; followed by swelling of salivary glands. The parotid salivary glands (which are located within your cheek, near your jaw line, below your ears) are most frequently affected.<br>  <br>   <br>  Complications<br>  <br>      Severe complications are rare. However, mumps can cause:<br>  <br>          * inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis)<br>          * inflammation of the testicles (orchitis)<br>          * inflammation of the ovaries and/or breasts (oophoritis and mastitis)<br>          * spontaneous abortion<br>          * deafness, usually permanent<br>  <br>   <br>  Transmission<br>  <br>      The mumps virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is spread through direct contact with respiratory secretions or saliva or through fomites.<br>  <br>      The infectious period or time that an infected person can transmit mumps to a non-infected person is from 3 days before symptoms appear to about 9 days after the symptoms appear.<br>  <br>      The incubation time, which is the period from when a person is exposed to virus to the onset of any symptoms, can vary from 16 to 18 days (range 12-25 days)

L5nNZx7Daa	In order to build a fuller chest, you must utilize several exercises.  Try switching the angle of your bench into an incline or decline to work the upper and lower part of your chest, respectively.  Also, incorporate body dips and push up into  your work out.  This can easily be done with two standard chairs.  Eat well, lots of protein and clean (unfatty) carbohydrates (meat and potatoes).  Remember, your muscles work in opposites, so in order to get a solid chest, you HAVE to also focus on strengthening your back muscles.  And, you must also work your supporting muscles (arms, shoulders, traps) in order to maximize your chest workouts and push more weight, break down more muscle fibers, and build back bigger and stronger.  And most important, keep working at it an be consistent.  You can't get jacked overnight-if you could, everyone would be huge.  You have to earn it in the gym and take care of you body outside of it.  Best of luck.|`|QGZyHZTsaa	**** yeah dude, give me a call when your buff, we should hook up.

Losing 3-5 pounds by  Saturday is a little far fetched. Healthy weight takes time. If you just starve yourself you initially lose just water weight. As soon as you go back to eating normally, your body will rehydrate and you will gain the weight back. 2. Pilate's is good but cardio is the key to fat burning. Get on a treadmill and walk or job thirty minutes a day. You'll lose weight and feel awesome!

They have some with fans and some are made of special material that I think absorb the heat from your laptop. I have an HP and use a cool pad and it has worked just fine.

Do NOT quit taking your medicine without the recommendation from your doctor first!!! The effects that this has on your body can be very bad (I have done it before and you feel like a drug addict coming off a high) This will make your chemicals in your brain unbalanced and you can do things that could be fatal or hurt your relationships.

VulcP0g4aa	An ovarian cyst is any collection of fluid, surrounded by a very thin wall, within an ovary. Any ovarian follicle that is larger than about two centimeters is termed an ovarian cyst. An ovarian cyst can be as small as a pea, or as large as a grapefruit.<br>  <br>  Most ovarian cysts are functional in nature, and harmless (benign). In the US ovarian cysts are found in nearly all premenopausal women, and in up to 14.8% of postmenopausal women. The incidence of ovarian carcinoma is approximately 15 cases per 100,000 women per year.<br>  <br>  Ovarian cysts affect women of all ages. They occur most often, however, during a woman's childbearing years.<br>  <br>  Some ovarian cysts cause problems, such as bleeding and pain. Surgery may be required to remove those cysts.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, after the operation u would be normal, u can continue u r role as a mother in u r future life.

a2231932512fb98c82bec483b2b1646baa	A mí me pasa y no es hipocondría, sino EXTRASíSTOLE, consulta con otro cardiólogo. En sí no es nada grave, sino que es molesto. Igual te hacen varias pruebas para descartar. Suele estar provocado por el estrés. En todo caso es psicosomatico, lo que no significa que te inventes una enfermedad, sino que lo psíquico afecta al cuerpo, la dolencia existe igual. La gente no conoce las enfermedades y las confunde.<br>  Si no te lo dijo un especialista no hagas caso, y consultá con otro cardiólogo, es algo así como que el corazón dan un vuelco y pierde un latido, por eso sentís palpitaciones y una es más fuerte, como que se te "saliera el corazón". <br>  Espero que te sirva, suerte y tranquila!!!|`|3192b7f8a022ed2b8ffd73f5637b292faa	Quien te lo dijo????...Un espècialista??....<br>  <br>  Qué es la hipocondría?<br>  La característica esencial de la hipocondría es la preocupación y el miedo a padecer, o la convicción de tener, una enfermedad grave, a partir de la interpretación personal de alguna sensación corporal u otro signo que aparezca en el cuerpo. Puede ocurrir, por ejemplo, con lunares, peque?as heridas, toses, incluso latidos del corazón, movimientos involuntarios, o sensaciones físicas no muy claras. Aunque el médico le asegure que no tiene nada, el hipocondríaco solamente se queda tranquilo un rato, pero su preocupación vuelve de nuevo. Para entenderla más profundamente se puede consultar la página en la que se describen los procesos psicológicos subyacentes en la hipocondría . <br>  <br>  2o) ?Por qué se llega a ser hipocondríaco?<br>  La interpretación catastrófica de los signos corporales es el mecanismo por el que se dispara la hipocondría. Por qué se dispara ese mecanismo es difícil de determinar. Se sabe que este trastorno afecta a menudo a ambientes familiares, es decir, que muchos miembros de una familia tienden a estar afectados. Esto nos puede indicar que hay familias que son especialmente sensibles y están muy inclinadas hacia la interpretación de los signos de enfermedad en todos los ámbitos de la vida. Durante las reuniones familiares no se habla más que de enfermedades, se comenta constantemente si se está bien o mal, se vive con muchísima angustia cualquier signo de enfermedad en alguno de los hijos, etc. etc. De esta forma los miembros de la familia aprenden a interpretar de esa forma cualquier signo corporal y lo asocian con angustia, miedo o ansiedad. Es una interpretación, aunque también se podría pensar que existe una predisposición genética. Lo importante no es el por qué, sino como solucionarlo.<br>  <br>  3o) ?Suele suceder tras un problema orgánico de cierta importancia?<br>  Puede suceder asociado a un problema orgánico, pero no necesariamente, ni siquiera con mucha frecuencia.<br>  <br>  4o) ?Puede establecerse un perfil de la persona hipocondríaca?<br>  Asociado a la hipocondría suele haber un miedo desmedido a la muerte, al dolor, al sufrimiento, a la debilidad o dependencia de otros.<br>  <br>  5o) ?Es cierto que presentan una mayor sensibilidad frente al dolor y eso les lleva a exagerar sus dolencias?<br>  Como decía, es cierto que puede haber miedo al dolor. El miedo hace que busquemos indicios de aquello que tememos, para prepararnos a solucionar lo que se avecina, que para nosotros es terrible. Eso hace que aquellos que tienen miedo al dolor busquen es su cuerpo cualquier indicio de que puede haber dolor para evitar que llegue a más. Si aparece la más mínima se?al, que para otra persona hubiera pasado inadvertida, se disparan todas las alarmas y aparecen síntomas de angustia y de ansiedad que causan un malestar muy grande y hacen que el dolor se incremente. No es que exageren sus dolencias, al a?adirles ansiedad y angustia se hacen realmente peores y más insoportables.<br>  <br>  Este proceso está en el fondo de muchos dolores crónicos, pero no necesariamente desemboca en una hipocondría. En el caso del hipocondríaco se da el miedo a la enfermedad y su preocupación persiste a pesar de las exploraciones y explicaciones médicas apropiadas.<br>  <br>  6o) ?Estas personas suelen pasar por períodos de mucha angustia debido a que se sienten incomprendidos?<br>  El hipocondríaco se siente muy incomprendido, nadie es capaz de detectar su enfermedad. Como piensa, naturalmente que necesita que encuentren su enfermedad para poder solucionarla no solamente se angustia, sino que lógicamente se deprime creyendo que lo que le pasa no tiene solución. El hipocondríaco sufre mucho, se cree enfermo y tiene sensaciones que el siente que se lo indican y lo único que recibe son palabras que le dicen que no tiene nada y que "todo es psicológico". Cuando se dice que todo es psicológico en realidad se le esta diciendo que todo es cuento; aunque desde luego lo que él (ella) siente es totalmente real, todo menos cuento. Los procesos psicológicos tienen una realidad total en el cuerpo y el dolor, la angustia y las enfermedades psicosomáticas son completamente reales, aunque los procesos que las desencadenan sean psicológicos y no correspondan a una enfermedad física. <br>  <br>  7o) ?Suelen evitar consulta a un profesional por miedo a que les descubra alguna enfermedad?<br>  En efecto, muchos de ellos prefieren quedarse con una duda, que les llena de angustia y ansiedad, a enfrentar la posibilidad de que les digan que están realmente enfermos. Los que van al médico lo suelen hacer de forma repetitiva porque tienen la experiencia de que cuando el médico les dice que no tienen nada se quedan momentáneamente tranquilos, aunque por desgracia les dura poco.<br>  <br>  8o) ?Cómo se llega al diagnóstico? ?Son necesarias pruebas exploratorias para descartar posibles problemas físicos?<br>  Lo primero que se hace es asegurar que no tienen ninguna enfermedad física. Una vez que se ha descartado, si el paciente sigue con angustia, preocupación y dudas acerca de su estado de salud, es conveniente estudiar la posibilidad de un trastorno psicológico.<br>  <br>  9o) ?En qué se basa el tratamiento?<br>  Una vez que se detecta que un paciente es hipocondríaco y que accede al tratamiento. Se definen claramente con el paciente los objetivos de la terapia, que son que pierda la angustia y el miedo a la enfermedad que teme.<br>  <br>  Para ello se plantean primero una serie de prohibiciones y tareas. Se le pide que no acuda a más médicos ni a las urgencias hospitalarias, que no hable de salud ni de enfermedad. Para esto es muy conveniente la colaboración de la familia del paciente, también para que entiendan que lo suyo no es cuento, que tiene un problema real aunque interpretado por todos como un problema que no existe. Una vez que se ha establecido este marco fuera de la consulta comienza el tratamiento psicológico propiamente dicho.<br>  <br>  El tratamiento básico consiste en perder el miedo a estar enfermo, cuando se está sintiendo la sensación que se teme. A veces es el propio pensamiento de estar enfermo que genera un miedo y una angustia muy grandes, es quien genera la sensación que se teme y se interpreta como enfermedad. Esa angustia es una sensación desagradable e inexplicable que genera más miedo. De esta forma, la propia ansiedad asociada al pensamiento de estar enfermo se convierte en un disparador de los miedos a la enfermedad. Se establece así un círculo vicioso en el que el miedo a la enfermedad causa unas sensaciones que son a su vez interpretadas como enfermedad. Otras veces, al intentar eliminar la sensación temida se potencia. (Para ver con más detalle como se implantan estos procesos se puede consultar la página sobre los procesos psicológicos en la hipocondría) <br>  <br>  En la terapia se trata de que el pensamiento de estar enfermo no dispare un miedo terrible. Para ello se emplean una las técnicas descritas en el libro "Curso Terapéutico de Aceptación I y II". Por ejemplo con la técnica de exposición a las sensaciones corporales, que consigue que el paciente pierda el miedo a los síntomas que interpreta como enfermedad. Aprende que si no huye de ellos, si no lucha contra ellos y los acepta, se pueden convertir en sensaciones admisibles que nos permiten seguir con nuestras actividades diarias sin mucho sufrimiento. Esta parte del tratamiento se realiza junto con un entrenamiento en técnicas de manejo de ansiedad que facilitan la exposición. (Se puede ver la aplicación de las técnicas del Curso en esta página) <br>  <br>  También hay que enfrentar el miedo a la enfermedad y a la muerte. Para ello se comienza un trabajo de desensibilización ante la enfermedad y la muerte de forma que se sitúe el miedo que causan al paciente en términos razonables. Se emplea la desensibilización en la imaginación a situaciones temidas y evitadas, para que finalmente el paciente pueda acercarse a ellas sin angustia y sin miedo.<br>  <br>  El paciente puede entonces comenzar a reinterpretar sus sensaciones corporales y sentir también aquellas que son agradables o neutras y su cuerpo deja de ser una fuente de dolor o temor y se puede convertir en un generador de placer y confianza.<br>  <br>  Verse enfermo tiene en nuestra sociedad una connotación de debilidad. Por ello entrenar al paciente en basar su autoestima en otros medios de valoración y se le entrena en aumentarla.<br>  <br>  Finalmente se trabaja para que el paciente pueda enfrentar con éxito otros problemas que aparecen en su vida cotidiana: toma de decisiones difíciles, como cambio de trabajo, separaciones, problemas de relación, etc. de forma que se pueda evitar que en el futuro se le desencadenen situaciones de depresión o angustia continuada que le pueden hacer recaer en sus problemas hipocondríacos.<br>  <br>  En algunos casos los psicofármacos pueden ser una ayuda, sobre todo al principio del tratamiento. En esos casos se requiere la intervención de un psiquiatra; pero hay muchos otros en los que el paciente se puede manejar sin ellos.<br>  <br>  Los estudios controlados que existen sobre este tratamiento, aunque no son definitivos, son muy esperanzadores, mi experiencia clínica con él es que da muy buenos resultados.<br>  <br>  En algunos casos los psicofármacos pueden ser una ayuda, sobre todo al principio del tratamiento. En esos casos se requiere la intervención de un psiquiatra; pero hay muchos otros en los que el paciente se puede manejar sin ellos.<br>  <br>  No existen muchos estudios controlados sobre esta enfermedad, pero mi experiencia clínica es que este tratamiento da muy buenos resultados.<br>  <br>  10o) ?Qué recomendaciones se pueden hacer a la persona con una tendencia clara a padecer este problema?<br>  Todos pensamos primero en como solucionar por nosotros mismos el problema. Para eso el Curso Terapéutico de Aceptación puede ser un primer paso. En él se explica con profundidad los mecanismos que hacen que la hipocondría se mantenga y cronifique y contiene una serie pautada de ejercicios dirigidos a aceptar nuestras sensaciones sin creencias irracionales de que son enfermedades, junto con otros dirigidos a vivir el presente y nuestro cuerpo plenamente, dejando las preocupaciones por la enfermedad para dedicarse a los valores que consideramos importantes en nuestra vida. En este enlace se puede ver cómo se aplica el curso al tratamiento de la hipocondría. <br>  <br>  Cuando ya se está en un proceso hipocondríaco sería conveniente que pensase que un psicólogo puede ayudarle a llevar esa enfermedad, que nadie es capaz de diagnosticarle y detectarle, con más tranquilidad y menor sufrimiento.<br>  <br>  Cuando uno está enfermo y la enfermedad es larga o grave, cambian nuestras relaciones sociales y recibimos un impacto psicológico importante, además de la enfermedad tenemos ansiedad, miedo, angustia. Si alguien está enfermo y angustiado puede necesitar una ayuda psicológica para vivir un estado difícil y doloroso de forma más entera, positiva y optimista. Aquellos que enfrentan su enfermedad con más tranquilidad y optimismo tienen más posibilidades de mejorar. Nuestra sociedad empieza a reconocer la importancia que puede tener el tratamiento psicológico en la superación de algunas enfermedades, pero se tiene que generalizar todavía más y se tendría que ver normal recibir un apoyo psicológico asociado al tratamiento médico. Si esto fuera así, cambiaría la visión de que solo se va al psicólogo si se está muy loco.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, todos sabemos que el estrés y la ansiedad hacen más probables enfermedades serias (de corazón, inmunológicas, etc.).<br>  <br>  Todas estas son razones para que si se tiene ansiedad o si se está deprimido, aunque sean porque se está enfermo, se acuda al psicólogo.|`|TmFZddMuaa	A mi me pasaba lo mismo es mas,me pasaba justo cuando alguien padecia del corazon o bien fallecia por algo en concreto,me daba la paranoia y creia que a mi me iba a pasar lo mismo,una vez acudi al medico pensando que tenia un paro cardiaco,es todo de cabeza,no se le puede decir que seas una hipocondriaca si no mas bien que tienes miedo a la muerte y no quieres que te pase nada,trata de controlar los pensamientos,no pensar en que te va a pasar algo y si no lo puedes controlar,acude a un especialista que te ayude a controlarlo<br>  Suerte|`|oUaMmFzmaa	o eso, o que tienes un soplo (no es grave) en el corazón.

Normalmente, ese estado de tensión psicológica de forma moderada, nos ayuda a hacer frente a los inconvenientes o temores de la vida diaria y a afrontar los retos que se nos van presentando.

Y bueno, como tienes la ventaja de que no ha habido nada entre ustedes, es más sencillo lograrlo. <br>  1) Ve sus defectos de forma exagerada<br>  2) Evita el contacto visual con él. Cuando platiquen intenta mirarlo lo menos posible al rostro.<br>  3) Evita el contacto físico, cualquiera que este sea, hasta el más mínimo.

L5nNZx7Daa	The "high" only lasts maybe 10-20 minutes depending on your personal tolerance.

Bc1TOdnhaa	It's probably just baby fat and you really shouldn't be dieting. It's ok to eat the right stuff but it's not ok to overexcersise. My friend excersised too much when he was growing up and it like stunted his growth so now he's really short. During puberty you'll grow and lose weight and get taller. Another friend of mine was really skinny and during the summer he grew. So now he's really tall and skinny and it looks totally gross. You're still a kid so don't worry about how you look.|`|ruFPv69maa	It is not good to weigh that little for a 5' 1" guy. You might think that it looks good, but it doesn't.

OllujKN1aa	Phentermine is 100% illegal to order online without a face-to-face doctor patient relationship involved. That's why all the sites that sell it are scams. They don't care about you or your weight loss and they just want to steal your money. My sister even got scammed by myrxbilling back in 2005 when they charged her card for 2 plane tickets to the cayman islands!!!<br>  <br>  I gave up on it after getting ripped off by rxfuture and then valupharm, so I took the plunge and tried the non prescription version called Phentramin (spelling?) which I got at <a href="http://www.phenforum.com/phentramin" rel="nofollow">http://www.phenforum.com/phentramin</a><br>  <br>  Please email me at debbiesmommy@yahoo.com if you want a buddy to lose weight with cause I'm actually looking for someone else around 220lbs.

I suggest Hoodia Gordonii instead, it's a powerful natural appetite suppressant with no side effects. <br>  <br>  Phentermine's side effects include:<br>  mood swings<br>  Agitation<br>  Depression<br>  Drowsiness<br>  Elevated blood pressure<br>  Increased blood pressure<br>  Irritability<br>  Nervousness<br>  Rapid or irregular heart beats.<br>  Tiredness <br>  <br>  Hoodia Gordonii is a natural appetite suppressant derived from a South African cactus that the bushmen have eaten there for thousands of years. Hoodia is safe and has no side effects, the only problem with Hoodia is making sure you get the real stuff. You need to make sure you get a strong pure hoodia that is certified to be genuine. I always recommend Totalink's unbiased Hoodia comparison at <a href="http://hoodiagordonii.totalink.com/hoodia_comparison.html" rel="nofollow">http://hoodiagordonii.totalink.com/hoodi...</a> <br>  <br>  I know this does not answer your question but I think it's still helpful related information. If you want more info on finding the best Hoodia I have written a lot of articles on it. Just search Yahoo or Google under my name “Andrew Aitaken” to find them. <br>  <br>  Remember, you should always consult your physician before taking any diet pill or weight loss supplement.

I take it every now and then to get myself back on a regular sleep schedule (if I seem to have started staying up too late and sleeping too late), but other than that, I don't have any problems with being addicted to it or not being able to go to sleep without it. There are also generic brands at Wal-Mart that work just as well. I prefer the Equate brand of it.|`|3V98ONgRaa	i find the valerian root is the best! i wouldn't trust many of the over the counter sleep aids, because the active ingredient in most is the same as the active ingredient in benadryl (diphenhydramine). and if it's quality sleep you want, then that's not the drug you want to take. there are still being studies done on it but right now research shows that the active ingredient in things like benadryl and tylenol pm and advil pm or any other over the counter sleep aid doesn't allow you to fully enter all of the REM stages. <br>  <br>  valerian root is an herbal remedy for releaving stress.  there is no hangover effect associated with it. you don't go to sleep feeling drugged and you don't wake feeling drugged either. you can find it in the pharmacy section or herbal section of your local grocery store. start out by taking 500-1000mgs (that's how they're sold). they are sold in capsule form and be warned they do smell. it may take a few days for it to build up in your system but you should notice a difference after about 5 days. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|zjroys7Oaa	Tylenol PM seems to work well.  <br>  <br>  If you need more information on insomnia head over to <a href="http://insomnia-relief-center.com" rel="nofollow">http://insomnia-relief-center.com</a> -- they are associated with the health information network <a href="http://the-health-information-network.com" rel="nofollow">http://the-health-information-network.co...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  tom

f7bc7b5de8be913313ea5bdd158dbec3aa	The arch of the foot is responsible for absorbing shock each time one takes a step; one puts 125% of their bodily weight on their feet during gait. If one has little or no arch, the foot is unable to distribute said weight adequately and absorb it. This, over times, gives way to stress/overuse injuries. People with flat feet are prone to develop lower back, knee and hip problems which progressively worsen. Also, when one is flat-footed they tend to over-pronate (pronation is a normal biomechanical action of the foot where it lands in a neutral position upon becoming into contact with the ground); over-pronation is when the foot, along with bones on the lower leg, is unable to maintain this neutral stance and rolls inward. One is susceptible to developing what is known as shin splints from the friction of the muscle in one's legs coming into contact with the bones. Additionally, the misaligned bones and patella (knee) may brush against one another leading to the deterioration of the cartilage in the knee, among other knee conditions. Now, if you'd be willing to correct your flat feet, I may be able to help. Contact me!|`|ajn97Wfxaa	If your feet give you problems, such as pain, your doctor can fit you for an arch support, otherwise you have to live with it like the other 30% of all people do.<br>  Most people don't notice, but shoes do come in widths, but the stores mainly sell only B or C width.<br>  You might try a D width if you can find it.|`|4DyNuWNaaa	you cant be cured if you have flat feet.|`|KkoTqCfWaa	a doctor cant help you with that problem.<br>  and my friend has the same problem.<br>  she wears flats.<br>  and she said that they are comfortable.<br>  then she tried different shoes like tennie shoes then started wearing high heals..(but not too high)<br>  and then her foot is not as flat.<br>  hope it helps[=|`|MWLWOJnTaa	I am, I really don't see anything wrong with it though.

As you approach 18, testosterone will continue to help your body put on additional muscle mass, among other changes (additional body hair, etc).<br>  <br>  My best suggestion would be to continue to focus on fitness and allow the mass to come as you continue to mature physically.  Make sure your diet contains a reasonable amount of protein (most Americans get all the protein they need due to a large amount of meat in their diets), make sure to get all of the vitamins you need from vegetables, and avoid any quick solutions people try to sell you on.<br>  <br>  Not everyone's body type is the same.

WkaWSKNAaa	Here is the process at a fertility office a friend works at:<br>  <br>  Once you have completed all requirements to become a donor, your profile will be put into our donor registry. If your profile is chosen by a recipient, the cycling/stimulation portion of the egg donation process will begin. There are three phases egg donors must undergo:<br>  1. Suppression<br>  You will be placed on oral contraceptives so we can control your cycle and synchronize it with that of the recipient. You will also be instructed to start an injectable medication (leuprolide acetate, Lupron) to suppress ovarian hormone production. Once suppression is achieved, you will begin the stimulation phase.<br>  2. Stimulation<br>  In a natural cycle, you would mature a single follicle – a specialized cyst that contains an egg – and ovulate a single egg. During this phase, you will take injectable medications called gonadotropins which stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple follicles. You will be monitored regularly with blood work and transvaginal ultrasound. This will enable your physician to closely monitor your blood hormone levels and the development of follicles.<br>  You may be instructed to come to our office every day. When the monitoring shows you to be hormonally appropriate with mature follicles, you will be ready for egg retrieval. You will be instructed to take a medication called human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG. This helps in the final maturation of the follicles and is a timed injection. You will be instructed to take this injection at a very specific time.<br>  3. Egg Retrieval<br>  Egg retrievals are done using transvaginal ultrasound directed needle aspiration (TVA). This is a minor surgical procedure performed under light general anesthesia or heavy intravenous sedation. A vaginal probe is placed in the vagina and a needle is inserted through a guide attached to the probe. This probe is identical to those used to perform ultrasounds in the monitoring phase of your cycle.<br>  The ultrasound image lets the physician accurately guide the needle through the vaginal wall directly into each follicle for aspiration. The process takes about 30 minutes. After retrieval, the donor will remain in the office until medically cleared – about one hour. Pain medication may be taken for discomfort, typically Tylenol 650-1000 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Complications of TVA are rare, but include the possibility of infection and persistent ovarian bleeding after the procedure, as well as injury to blood vessels during the procedure.<br>  In the event of suspicion of a rare complication – severe abdominal or pelvic pain after the procedure, persistent low blood pressure or dizziness – hospitalization and possible emergency surgery may be required. Someone must accompany the donor to this appointment, as she will be restricted from driving after the procedure. The donor will be instructed to return to the office in two weeks or with their next menses, whichever comes first. At this time, she will have a post retrieval followup including a transvaginal ultrasound.<br>  <br>  The final step will be a revisit appointment about two weeks after retrieval. A pelvic exam will be performed. You will also meet with the nurse coordinator for case closure and receive payment for your time and commitment. Any questions or concerns you may have can be addressed at that time.|`|e2de75a1d329eb66ec7376356629bd18aa	It's all about the friendship, if you are truly with a kind of heart want to help, there is nothing can be the reason why.. if you really want to do this I am the 1st person to salute you.
fM0r8sd2aa	Diet and exercise. All the sit-ups in the world won't give you great looking abs if they're covered by a layer of body fat.<br>  <br>  There is no magic weight-loss pill, supplement, fad diet, or juice. The ONLY way to lose weight is to consume less calories than you burn. Brad Pitt didn’t get buff for Fight Club by drinking green tea and you won’t either.<br>  <br>  The only way to lose weight is to consume less calories than you burn.<br>  <br>  To lose weight, experts agree you need to exercise for at least 30 minutes at 60%-70% of your Max Heart Rate (MHR). A simple way to calculate MHR is 220 minus your age. So if you’re 45 years old, for example, your MHR would be 220-45=175. 60% of 175 is 105, and 70% of 175 is 122.5. So you should exercise daily for 30 minutes at a heart rate between 105 and 123.<br>  <br>  You don’t need additional equipment—infomercial products like the Ab Lounger, Sauna Belt, etc. are all worthless gimmicks so don’t waste your money.<br>  <br>  Eat breakfast, and eat five small meals per day instead of three big meals. If you don't wake up ravenous, then you ate too much the day before. Stop eating at least two hours before you go to bed. Cut back on the foods you eat with high fat and high sugar content. Eat only single servings (read the label) with less than 3 grams trans fat and 3 grams sugars. Become familiar with websites like <a href="http://chubbyloser.com" rel="nofollow">http://chubbyloser.com</a> that contain good information on what to eat, including supplements.<br>  <br>  Don't consume alcohol—alcohol is nothing more than empty calories with no nutritional value. Some people will argue that alcohol has some health benefits when consumed in moderation—I’m not debating that—but we’re talking about weight loss here. Lay off the booze if you want to lose the belly.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, then drink more. Not tea, not Gatorade, not milk. Water. If your urine isn’t almost clear, you need to drink more water. <br>  <br>  Woof.|`|AA10920914	Try some sit ups... walk a mile or two... do some crunches...

PLAToiFWaa	I am a mother of two so I know what you are going through. When a woman has a baby she is left with stretched skin and stretch marks but some women are lucky! But for those that are not we are left with saggy stomach. My stomach is stretched and only can be repaired with a tummy tuck. However when I did carry excess weight my stomach did go down,but I still have saggy skin. No matter how much weight you loose the skin will never pop back because its elasticity has been stretched. <br>  <br>  Weight loss is possible after the baby. There are a few key points to remember. When you are trying to loose the weight remember that you are not pregnant anymore, so you cant eat like that. Think back how you used to eat before all of the babies. Was it healthy or bad? If it was healthy, then you should get back to what you were doing. If it was bad then you should start making small changes in your diet. I know as a mother myself that working out is hard. But if you really want it then you have to make a sacrifice!|`|aRH8Wy6aaa	Of course you can lose it.

Regardless of what's causing it, I totally understand what it's like to be frustrated and doubled over in pain. I have had many cysts and even had one rupture along with a few minor female occurances. There's no way to know for sure without seeing the doc (sorry bout that but it is time to see one, and important for your health since you've been having your period.) you could try taking Ibuprofen and Aleve together. Take one of each with food and plenty of water then alternate back and forth between the 2 every 4-6hrs. Just be sure not to take over the recommended amount of either(check the labels). You could also try a heating pad or hot bath as it shouldn't do any harm no matter what the issue really is. This helps me with the pain sometimes of ovulation cramping too. You are still young and having irregular periods is considered "normal" but I would suggest talking with your mom, aunt, grandma, or sister. In my family we seem to have similar womanly issues as each other. They may have some ideas for you. <br>  Good luck sweetie, hope everything turns out ok for ya!|`|CuVzQ8BIaa	Question<br>  <br>  I have been having a straining pain, which is painful and uncomfortable in my left ovary, when having sex. Why could this be? <br>  <br>  Answer<br>  <br>  I think that such symptoms of two days duration, and at the age of 22, are unlikely to be serious at all, and may even settlevery quickly. However, if it persists, or worsens then an opinion and examination by your GP would be sensible.<br>  <br>  If you are not on the Pill, and you are fairly mid-cycle, it could be ovulation discomfort, or it could be a small cyst around the ovary, which are often self-limiting and rapidly resolve. <br>  <br>  Discuss this if necessary with your doctor, but do not worry in the mean time.

AA12081817	I lost 105 pounds in 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  <br>  <br>  Also start counting your calories.  Write them down.  You would be amazed as to how much more aware you are of your caloric intake, if you actually write it down.  We recently discovered a site that offers a great program that counts calories, as well as keeps track of everything.  It allows multiple users, so everyone in the family can keep track.  They offer a free 7 day trial, and so far I am very impressed with the product.  Try the 7 days and see.  It allows you to add the exercise that you do during the day, which increases the amount of calories you can take in.

I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of impurities.  Impurities come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The impurities get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the impurities by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

I'm doing the sculpting ball work-outs they seem to help alot when I do them at least 3 times a wk. You can notice a change in your body and it also makes you look slimmer.

y2MUaOsLaa	Here are some tips on healthily gaining weight:<br>  <br>  >TAKE IT SLOWLY<br>  <br>  *Gaining weight and keeping it on can be as tricky as losing it and keeping it off. Rather than having the occasional extra snack, you need to regularly take in more calories than you burn. Combining this with toning exercises helps too. <br>  <br>  *Set yourself realistic target weights and aim to gain gradually - say, around 1kg (2.2lb) a month. To do that you'll need to add an extra 300 to 350 calories or so to your daily intake. It's best to do this in a healthy way as part of a balanced diet, rather than simply eating more fried foods or chocolate!<br>  <br>  <br>  >TOP TIPS<br>  <br>  *Keep a food diary for a couple of weeks to learn more about your eating habits. <br>  <br>  *Rather than struggling to eat a few really big meals, plan three regular meals plus two or three snacks. <br>  <br>  *If you tend to eat erratically, write down a regular meal plan and keep to it. <br>  <br>  *Make meals a little larger or more calorific. For example, have an extra slice of toast at breakfast; drink grape juice rather than orange juice; make coffee with milk; serve an extra spoon of mash, rice or pasta; be more generous with healthier unsaturated oils, salad dressing and spreads; always have a dessert. <br>  <br>  *Have snacks to hand so you never go short. Good choices include nuts, seeds and raisins; pots of rice pudding, custard or yoghurt; cereal or cereal bars; flapjacks; milk, yoghurt drinks or smoothies; a scone or fruit bun; wheatmeal biscuits; cheese and crackers; fruit plus small chocolate bar. <br>  <br>  <br>  >EXCERCISE OPTIONS<br>  <br>  *Although exercise helps to burn calories, it's important to include some form of activity into your plan to help keep your bones strong and your muscles toned.<br>  <br>  *Ensure regular physical activity for 30 minutes (or two 15-minutes sessions), five days a week - walking is ideal. <br>  <br>  *Combine this with some resistance training using gym equipment or home weights, if possible. First seek safe advice from a qualified fitness adviser. <br>  <br>  *Take care not to be too active. If you're someone who's always on their feet, make time to relax each day. <br>  <br>  *Keep up your increased food intake to fuel your exercise - with enough to spare to allow you to gain weight gradually. <br>  <br>  Hope these tips help you to feel better about yourself and good luck.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|L5nNZx7Daa	Eat a large spoonful of peanut butter right before you go to bed.

Common side effects involve drowsiness and possibility for habit forming.  It works well for long flights or temporary relief.  Some poeple will take it for years but I personally don't recommend that.  Your best bet is to form good sleep habits otherwise known as sleep hygiene.  Don't watch tv in bed, don't eat, do work or even read in bed.  Anything that forces your mind to expel energy and process thought while on your bed will make it associate the bed with activity rather than rest.  Any psychiatrist will tell you the bed should be only for rest and sex.  There are other meds which will not cause habit.  Look up sleep hygiene, lunesta and rozerem (a non-habit forming sleep agent).  Compare what you read and see what best suit you.  I hope this helps.|`|f2ebcc6f8692252ee4077de8f0b301a9aa	never tried lunesta but have had both ambian and ambian CR..while the ambian puts you to sleep..u have a tendency to wake up earlier while the ambian CR puts u to sleep and u sleep for at least 7-8 hrs so i would go with ambian CR

Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day.

65f96a3f83910747fd7abf05cccb8ef1aa	It is nice to hear that there are still some people who want to gain muscle and are not looking for short cuts. You are completely right you do not need to take any supplements at all. All this means is that you are not able to get enough nutrients in your normal diet. What people don't realise is that if you take too much protein it gets stored as fat and puts a huge strain on your liver. It is a long topic but needless to say that exercise is the primary point and you will need to exercise very hard. Low reps heavy weights lots of sets, but always good technique. As for the muscle gain through a natural diet I have recently written an article on my blog all about it. I have included a link for you, I hope it helps and good luck!|`|AA10916092	Do a few of these things and you'll tone up, bulk up, and look leaner and stronger:<br>  <br>  1. Double your water intake<br>  <br>  2. Drop booze - or if you have too, experiment with Japanese sake (very low carbs). It's not called a beer belly without reason<br>  <br>  3. Embed a tough cardio regime into your daily routine like cycling to work instead of taking publoic transport, or join a local swimming bath and commit to three nights a week...choose an activity and stick to it<br>  <br>  4. Eat largeish breakfasts, smaller lunches, and smaller dinners. Snack regularly on almonds, dried fruit, and bananas<br>  <br>  5. Gym three times a week. You pack on more muscle with quality rest time<br>  <br>  6. Keep keen.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10935344	Drinking plenty of water, I heard, also helps IN burning fat.|`|AA11679006	many supplements are natural. but the only way to build muscles is to get enough protein in along with carbs as you will burn protein as fuel if you don't have enough calories in|`|HaX9V8EMaa	cut lactose/milk from your diet and eat plenty of red meat small portions but six or seven times a day and you must do equal amounts of cardio work also put faith in visualisation|`|kZzna5Qaaa	naw just use HGH or a good steriod!!!!!!!!!|`|3bda4b213b77b1aca382e18f760b37c3aa	You dont need supplements for anything. The primary foundation of muscle gain is -Caloric surpluss- eating more calories then you burn aswell as -Resistance training- performing sit ups with weight, side sit ups, leg raises, crunches, pulldowns will all builds your abs. <br>  <br>  You will need to strip the fat off your abs for them to be revealed through calorie deficit.|`|jyVHepZ5aa	Well firstly natural bodybuilding is bodybuiding without steroids and HGH, but protein supplements are fine. If you really just dont want to use them then try this. Eat more calories than you burn, plenty of protein, moderate amounts of complex carbs (not so much after 4pm) and a small amount (about 20% of daily intake of food) of unsaturated fats. Building mass takes time. I find a great technique is to write down in a journal everything you eat, how you feel, any exercise, any thing that is detrimental to your program such as alcahol. If you keep a record then its easier to change things if it doesnt work. <br>  <br>  A good six pack comes from fat loss. The big guts that bodybuilders have isn't natural, its caused by HGH, and its possibly one of the most controversial things in bodybuilding these days. Anyway good luck with your plan and hope this helped.

4b06bef65f424cdae710e34b9b76bac7aa	For one thing get rid of the backstabbing friend.  Friends like that will mess with your man behind your back because they are jealous of you.  Second, keep in mind no guy is perfect and the next cute guy that comes around will probably be better than the last.  <br>  <br>  How to make him notice you--What does he like?  Football? Find out his favorite football team and pass him a note did you see the game last night? New music video? TV shows?  Find out what he likes that way you guys can talk about it.  Ask him for help with your homework or make up the excuse you didn't get all of the teachers notes the day before if he has them so you can copy it.  Maybe once or twice (no more than twice) ask him what does this say (like pretend you don't understand his handwriting.) When you are done ask him if he understands what the heck the teacher is talking about.  I understand this, but did you get that part?  And finally do not throw yourself at him and make it so obvious.  That normally turns a guy off.  Guys like a challenge. They don't like things that come too easy.|`|AA12295517	Communication!!!

Just enjoy it.<br>  <br>  What changes will occur during puberty?<br>  <br>  There are specific stages of development that boys go through when developing secondary sexual characteristics. The following is a brief overview of the changes that occur:<br>  <br>  In boys, the initial puberty change is the enlargement of the scrotum and testes. At this point, the penis does not enlarge.<br>  Then, as the testes and scrotum continue to enlarge, the penis enlarges mainly in length.<br>  Next, the penis will continue to enlarge in both size and length.<br>  Pubic hair development is similar for both girls and boys. The initial growth of hair produces long, soft hair that is only in a small area around the genitals.<br>  This hair then becomes darker and coarser as it continues to spread.<br>  The pubic hair eventually looks like adult hair, but in a smaller area. It may spread to the thighs and, sometimes, up the stomach.<br>  <br>  The following website should help you.|`|AA10744085	No; it's not painful.|`|AA11799144	No. No reason to have any pain anywhere unless you hurt yourself.|`|ADxTMI6Zaa	no but ur nots get itchy sometimes|`|WZuwExOPaa	not painful, but youll probably experience some embarrassing moments. dont worry though, as every boy goes through the same feelings and its all perfectly normal|`|e95c60def7314e19e9021c46eaa5fea1aa	no its not at all the only thing you might suffer from is gettin a hard on in the middle of class lol|`|120c60c12dfdaeb9a8a7fc5e4b62595baa	No, it's not painful.

Please see my post on why swimming is not beneficial for fat loss: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj2dpRgMlCCjd3DYEYKztALty6IX?qid=20070517132130AAsHLji&show=7#profile-info-9tCAmZP8aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  The abdominal muscles work just like any other muscle and have to be challenged as such. If you want muscular abdominals, you have to challenge them with resistance and good form just like you would your chest, your back or any other muscle for that matter. Targeting the correct energy system is imperative. This means you should never enter into the aerobic phase of this exercise, ideally keeping it under 2 minutes at most. <br>  <br>  Think of rolling a carpet and contracting fully on the top of the movement and squeeze. If you do them correctly, you shouldn't be able to do more than 30 crunches. Any more than that, and you're probably doing them half-azz, incorrectly or with a partial range of motion.<br>  <br>  For the upper abs, focus on crunches which effectively work the abdominals better than sit-ups or any machine on the market.  Crunches on a stability ball is one of the best ways to perform crunches.  Any core syngergistic activity will complement ab development.<br>  <br>  For the lower abs, keep in mind there is very little muscle tissue there so decreasing levels of body fat (via cardio and a great diet) is the most effective way to bring out the best in this area. Hanging leg raises, v-situps and reverse curls are among some of the best exercise for this region. Always make sure your pelvis curls up to maximize lower abdominal contraction during these exercises.<br>  <br>  As far as fat loss and getting ripped goes, cardio, cardio, cardio. Abdominal exercises alone will never burn fat from your abdominal area. You must do cardiovascular exercise to accomplish this. Cardio is best in the morning, on an empty stomach at about 70-80% of your maximum heart rate for about 30-45 minutes (you may have to work up to this level). This combined with a common sense diet will quickly shed body fat so you can actually see those abs you've developed. <br>  <br>  I would encourage you to seek the advice and guidance of a personal trainer in your area for further education on these principles. Please ensure you start off at a very basic level for crunches and cardio if you are a beginner.<br>  <br>  Here are some excellent links to build a great mid-section.<br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/Strength_Exercises_abdominals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/St...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/swiss_ball.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/sw...</a>

The only time purging is a good idea is if you ate something bad (poison for instance) and need to get it out of your system before it does more harm.<br>  <br>  Purging not only brings up what you ate but also removes bodily chemicals (enzymes, for instance) which are necessary for your body to function properly.  The more often you do this, the worse off your body will be.  It's dangerous---so dangerous that there's a chance (albeit a small one) that you could die from it any time you do it.  The more often you do it, the more of a strain it puts on the body, and the more likely that any one instance of it could do serious damage.<br>  <br>  If you're doing this a few times a week, you should seek professional help.

We evolved with apes but not from them.  I think that it may also offend those who do not believe in evolution (even though you can't deny it's existance due to the fact that everytime bacteria reproduce they are evolving and changing; in fact evolution is simply a change that happens gradually over time) I think this may be the reason.

You may experience some breakthrough bleeding, or you could bleed the whole time you are on it.<br>  <br>  3. There have been a few cases of women getting pregnant while on the shot, but chances are very slim. With all birth control you have a risk of pregnancy. With depo, its slim, but if you do get pregnant while on the shot you're baby may have severe birth defects.<br>  <br>  4. It's recommended that you only use Depo if you cannot take any other longterm birth control. It leads to osteoporosis.<br>  <br>  5. Yes, but it may take up to 18 months before you are able to conceive.<br>  <br>  Don't forget about the weight gain most women experience. I gained 20 lbs within the first month. My doctor said it was water weight, but 6 months later it's still there. Good luck with depo.

You can even just take a tums a few times a day for calclium<br>  <br>  5.  Depo doesn't effect your fertility. If you can get pregnant before depo, once you're off you'll be able to get pregnant.|`|VNiV7ZNJaa	I'm on depo myself, so I'll try to be as much help as possible.<br>  <br>  1. I don't really know, but I wouldn't take the chance. I wait a week or two after I get my shot before I do anything risky.<br>  <br>  2. I spot damn near every day. However, one of my friend's bleeding stopped completely. It depends on your body.<br>  <br>  3. Yes. No birth control or contraceptive is 100% effective against preventing pregnancy except abstinence.<br>  <br>  4. There are all sorts of weirdo side effects. Two include acne and facial hair. My face is no hairier than it was when I started, but I do think I get more breakouts. Another big one is that depo weakens your bone density, and it gets worse the longer it is administered. So drink plenty of milk!<br>  <br>  5. Yes you can, but the effects of depo can last up to a year after your last shot.

37aba7f5022b5ddfb06909f37524a2bfaa	There is no best ab work out. That is why there are so many variations of it. However after use to doing 800+ crunches I have found a better and easier way to do them.<br>  <br>  Hanging Leg Raises<br>  <br>  I read this in men's health. Use a pull-up bar, and your legs should be hanging off of the ground. From a hanging position bring your knees up to your chest. At first you will probably only be able to do 10-20. However this is equivalent to 40-50 regular ones. Try it out, and you will feel your abs burn way faster than doing regular crunches. <br>  <br>  Not only does it work out the ab muscle more, but it also works your lats, your grip and legs. This is also a good workout after doing any arm workout because it will help stretch the muscle out.<br>  <br>  There are variations of this also. You can bring your knees to your left side and right side to concentrate on the side and lower abs more. Doing straight knee raises this will help overall. Also you can keep your legs straight and bring them parallel to the ground. <br>  <br>  I use to do many crunches, now I just do 3-4 sets of 20 and I'm good. <br>  <br>  There is a good explanation on the following link.<br>  <br>  p.s. as stated in the following article it is good to be in shape before trying these. Its not for beginners.|`|5a1b5784d914d08eac3432576fe80761aa	bycicle , bridge , side bridge, swiss ball crunch, swissball jacknife,steam engine|`|bf307f062a81a16d7dac082674cb20fcaa	First of all you need to start eating healthy which helps then walk real fast or go for a run tones the whole bod.

The only way you are going to get abs is to eat low calorie and do lots of cardio.  Your abs are already there you just need to have a low body fat to see them.  Yeah if you want to do crunches it wont hurt but instead of doing abs i just do more cardio which i think is better.

b59b54edd2042dce1818f15b12c396b4aa	I've had the "fluttering" problem for years.  However, I've never had the angina (chest pain) that you describe.  You need to see a doctor.  The irregular heartbeat can be caused by a number of things and a cardiologist will run some tests to isolate the cause.  In my case, it has something to do with an electrolyte imbalance.  It can also be caused by nicotine and caffeine.  <br>  <br>  Whatever else you do, see a doctor soon.  As I previously pointed out, the angina is not something to be ignored.|`|2AhS5fWYaa	I've been experiencing the same thing lately.  I thought it was my upper abdomen, but it is in fact heart palpitations.  You may want to be seen by a doctor.  Often, it is nothing to worry about, but you need to know for sure.|`|2e503ebc083456b5bc3b033f30ef649faa	It could be. Do you happen to drink alot of caffeine or eat things with chocolate in it ? These things can make your heart flutter as well as stress. Some medicines can also cause it such as decongestants and sinus meds. I  would keep a check on it and go to the doctor if you do not get to feeling better.|`|8J6Mz39naa	anxiety|`|mLcjxVA3aa	i'm not a doctor, but it sounds like your describing palpitations.<br>  <br>  A palpitation is an awareness of the beating of the heart, whether it is too slow, too fast, irregular, or at its normal frequency. Palpitations may be brought on by overexertion, adrenaline, alcohol, disease (such as hyperthyroidism) or drugs, or as a symptom of panic disorder. More colloquially, it can also refer to a shaking motion. It can also happen in mitral stenosis.<br>  <br>  Nearly everyone experiences an occasional awareness of their heart beating, but when it occurs frequently, it can indicate a problem. Palpitations may be associated with heart problems, but also with anemias and thyroid malfunction.<br>  <br>  Attacks can last for a few seconds or hours, and may occur very infrequently, or more than daily. Palpitations alongside other symptoms, including sweating, faintness, chest pain or dizziness, indicate irregular or poor heart function and should be looked into.<br>  <br>  Palpitations may also be associated with anxiety and panic attacks, in which case psychological assessment is recommended.<br>  <br>  i'd get checked just to be safe =)

02d0dbba77861d90576aef0958f8bca9aa	You have myopia.<br>  <br>  Do the contacts give you 20/20 vision?<br>  <br>  You can have laser correction done.  You might be too young for this, though.  Your refractive error may not be stable yet.  Having laser surgery done before your error stabilizes may result in repeat treatments.  Consult an ophthalmologist to see if you are already a candidate for this type of surgery.  Take note: this type of surgery is expected to improve your vision only to the level that glasses or contact lenses do.  i.e. if contacts only get you to 20/40, laser treatment probably won't get you to 20/20.<br>  <br>  If your best corrected vision isn't 20/20, go see a retina specialist.  You may have pathologic myopia.|`|AA10691201	Google "eye excercises". They can help a bit.|`|4C2ykEWBaa	Well when you are outside during the day wear sunglasses.

You see, if you eat a lot of sweets, your body may not handle it and it could be coming out through your urine. If the sugar is expressed out through urine, the more the yeast infection bacteria will stay there, it's food for them basically. Gross, I know, but if you wash that area with an antibacterial soap, (there's many kinds designed for that specific area only-- a product called summer EVE should do the trick) and you drink lots of water to flush out whatever you have, it should lessen.<br>  <br>  About the white stuff and oozey things, if you don't want it on your underwear, try using the kotex light pantyliners-- the very thin strips (dont use the heavy pads, they tend to make the itchyness more)--, it will protect you from that stuff on your undies. But i stress that you tell your mom right away. Have her take you to an ob/gyn and be aware that there is more than one kind of bacteria to yeast infections and that they should test you for everything. From there, medicine may work.<br>  <br>  Best of luck on your endeavor!

3V98ONgRaa	i strongly suggest valerian root. it's great at relieving stress and tension! you can get it over the counter and it's a great sleep aid! if you have one of those "racing minds" or "i can't turn my head off no matter how tired i am" then this will definitely help. you can find at your local grocery store in the pharmacy or herbal remedy section. start off taking 500-1000mgs, 30-45 minutes before you go to bed. now you can get this stuff in capsule form and it's 100% safe (my whole family has been taking it for years and our family doctor actually recommended it) however the only downside is that the more potent the brand your taking the stronger the smell. and this stuff smells AWFUL! but it's worth it. within 5-7 days you should notice a definite change in your sleep. <br>  <br>  WARNING! i strongly do not suggest that you take Tylenol PM and booze, in any form or combination. the main ingredient in Tylenol PM and Advil pm, or benadryl for that matter is diphenhydramine. here's what happens when you take it:<br>  You can walk into a drugstore and choose from an array of sleep aids, offered without prescription. The main ingredient of over-the-counter sleeping pills is an antihistamine. Antihistamines are generally taken for allergies, but also make you feel very sleepy. Common over-the-counter sleep medications are Sleep-Eze, Sominex, Nytol, and Unison; they contain antihistamines such as:<br>  <br>  diphenhydramine hydrochloride, <br>  diphenhydramine citrate, or <br>  doxylamine succinate. <br>  In general, over-the-counter sleep medications are not a good choice because they:<br>  <br>  Are not intended for long-term use. <br>  Interfere with mental alertness during the day, so you should avoid driving and other similar tasks. You may also be at risk for falling asleep<br>  Reduce the quality of your sleep by reducing time you spend in deep sleep. <br>  Use over-the-counter sleep medications only for transient or short-term insomnia and in conjunction with changes to your sleeping habits. Be sure to pay attention to your body’s physical response to these sleep medications.<br>  <br>  also look at the links on the website i've listed they have some good remedies! <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|GiLg07FWaa	Your sleep disruption and snacking is actually happening on account of anxiety.

This made me tired enough after I took a shower to sleep through the night.  Do this for about two weeks and you will break the cycle.|`|eIn9dDMdaa	I've always been told that the urge to snack late at night is your body asking for fuel to keep you awake. Since you are not purposely trying to stay awake, I would suggest you start looking for causes of agitation that would keep you up.<br>  <br>  -Emotional: are you under a lot of stress, depressed, anxious, experienced a recent trauma, feel your thoughts are racing uncontrollably, etc?<br>  <br>  -Physical: are you thirsty (often when we think we're hungry, what we really are is thirsty), are you in pain of any kind, are your muscles tense, is your bed appropriately comfortable, are the noise and temperature levels appropriate to your preferences within your bedroom, etc?<br>  <br>  Depending on which of these you are experiencing, the course of action may include one or more of the following:<br>  - a medication sleep aid prescribed by a doctor<br>  - valerian root supplement (if you prefer herbal remedies)<br>  - yoga or other meditative relaxation<br>  - adjusting the aspects of your bedroom... bed, sheets, thermostat, noise level, colors, etc that may be over-stimulating you<br>  - NO caffeine within 6-8 hours before bedtime, preferably none at all<br>  - other stimulants like nicotine, or alcohol and drug use, can impact your sleep as well<br>  - seek psychiatric care for emotional issues<br>  <br>  There are more I could suggest, but I hope this will get you off to a fair start and that you find your restfulness soon. Take care

urmPkuxkaa	First off you should only work out for 45 min. at a time any more and your burning off what you just built. If all you have is a bench you should start off with basic bench press with 75% of your body weight. Go to any store with a magazine rack and buy a muscle and fitness magazine. There will be a workout section with a guide and a planner, and its basicly how to gain 20 lbs. in 6 weeks. This is what I went by when I was 18 my Freshman year in college I was 5'11" 155lbs. it was a 6 week class over the summer and I was 173 lbs. at the end of the class. Im a junior now and Im about 185 and I bench 315. Trust me that magazine is the easiest way to go!

ri96In0vaa	Although the name appearing next to my answer is "Soapman", that is my husband. He likes to answer questions on here, but I saw yours and felt compelled to respond. I recently went through the same thing. I am 26, and we wanted to have our first child. I became pregnant a month after getting off the pill (I had had my period once), and then I miscarred at 5 weeks 4 days (on April 26). As i am sure you know it was not fun. I too went to my doctor and she said wait at least one cycle and then you can try again. However, I didn't want to wait, and so I did a lot of research. What I found was that most doctors tell you to wait a cycle so that they can better predict your due date when you do get pregnant again. That way they know when you last menstrated. Also, if you had a D&C, where they have to physically remove the fetus, you need time for the tissue in your uterus to become healthy again. In my case, it occured naturally, and the miscarriage was just like a heavy period. In addition, you are not alone. I have read many percentages and it seems to me that most women will miscarry at some point in their lives. It is very common for miscarriages to occur within the first 6 weeks. This usually occurs because of a chromosomal abnormallity and your body recognizes something is not right and miscarries, which means that it is not any fault of the woman. A smaller percentage of miscarriages may occur between 6-12 weeks, but after that the chance of miscarriage is very slim. If you miscarry after that there may be something wrong with your uterus, or something more complicated that a doctor would diagnose for you. Because I miscarried early on, and it occured naturally (without the D&C), and I had read that you are more fertile the first 3 months after a miscarriage, my husband and I decided to proceed as usual, and if I became pregnant, well then my body was ready to carry a child. The good news that I want to share with you is that I found out I was pregnant 3 1/2 weeks after the day my miscarriage began. Essentially, I ovulated 2 weeks from the first day of my miscarriage (just as you would ovulate 2 weeks from the first day of your period) and conceived. I am now almost 16 weeks pregnant and have heard the baby's heart beat on two occasions at the doctor's office. And to make you feel even better- I only have one ovary, the other was removed when I was 14 because of ovarian cysts. So you and your man should just relax, realize that miscarriages happen to the majority of women as nature's way of making sure a healthy baby develops, and get to baby making! You got pregnant once, so you can definitely do it again. Good luck and may the stork be with you!|`|AA11782884	I've never miscarried, but I do know of an herbal tea that has helped my ovaries and uterus strengthen and is commonly used throughout that homeopathic world. It is used in moderation ( one 8 oz cup daily, one bag or one teaspoon steeped for <5 minutes) durring pregnancy for a smooth pregnancy and a STRONG concoction( 1/3 cu in 3 cups hot water steeped for40 minutes)  after labor commenses for a smoother delivery. It is "red rasberry leaf tea". you can find it pre packaged at health food stores or loose leaf as well. I use it now that I am not pregnant because it soothes my uterus that I have so many problems with. The Idea is that it makes the muscles in your uterus healthy and elastic so they are better able to do their job. ( pushing the baby, housing the baby ect)<br>   My very best wishes to you and yours!<br>  jennifer
ri96In0vaa	If you have sex you can get pregnant. If you have not had sex since your last period than you can't be pregnant, but if you have, of course you may be pregnant. The Plan B pill may or may not have affected your cycle. My advice would be to get a pregnancy test at the store. Better yet get a pack of three. If it is negative (meaning you aren't pregnant) and you still don't get your period within a few days, take another test because pregnancies don't always show up the day you miss your period. Also, pregnancy tests are most accurate if you pee on them first thing in the morning when any potential pregnancy related hormones are most concentrated in your urine. If you are pregnant set up an appointment with a doctor. If you aren't, maybe it is time to approach sex responsibly. Use birth control or don't have sex. Babies cost more than birth control.|`|ca071eebf8685c8ebbdd3dec131360d5aa	Don't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant. Either that or use a condom.

I'm not terribly familiar with the effects of the Plan B pill, but I also know that alot of stress can put your period off. I'd take a pregnancy test.

If you live on the first floor it shouldn't be an issue. I'm assuming you live on the second floor, and in that case it's probably too loud.

I'm not sure if that's what made me sick, but it's the only connection I could make.  Better be safe than sorry.  Throw out the old ones and see if you can get a new bottle.  In the meantime, wet a  hand towel, throw it in the freezer for 20 min. and put behind your neck...I discovered this helped a little with my headaches when I didn't have Tylenol around.  <br>  Hope you feel better!

There are two factors. <br>  1) First, as your body makes the dramatic shift of eliminating foods that are poorly digested or toxic, the first thing it does is try flush out the toxins that are already there.<br>  Those toxins are mainly deposited in the fat tissue, so the process of eliminating toxins also means eliminating fat.<br>  2) The second factor is the effects that specific foods have on the bodily systems that control weight. Depending on your blood type, the lectin activity of certain foods may do the following:<br>  __ Interfere with the digestive process.<br>  __ Slow down the rate of food metabolism, so you don't efficiently burn calories<br>  for energy.<br>  __ Compromise the production of insulin.<br>  __ Upset the hormonal balance, causing water retention (oedema), thyroid<br>  disorders and other problems.<br>  <br>  Our blood contains aeons of genetic memory--bits and pieces of specific programming, passed on from our ancestors in codes we are still attempting to comprehend. One such code rests within our blood type. Perhaps it is the most important code we can decipher in our attempt to unravel the mysteries of blood and its vital role in<br>  our existence.<br>  <br>  __ When you use the individualized characteristics of your blood type as a guide for eating and living you will be healthier, you will easily reach your ideal weight and you will slow the process of ageing.<br>  <br>  __ Your blood type is a more reliable measure of your identity than race, culture or geography.

wqcbmNSmaa	Hola esto lo encontre en otra pregunta espero que te sirva.<br>  <br>   un electrocardiograma es el examen más básico para estudiar el ritmo del corazón. Descubierto hace ya más de 80 a?os, sigue teniendo mucha vigencia por los datos que aporta con respecto a la actividad eléctrica del corazón, y también sobre algunas enfermedades que puedan estar. En el caso de su novio, el médico le encontró una arritmia, la preocupación suya entonces es la Arritmia cardíaca. El término arritmia es muy genérico y va desde variantes normales del corazón, especialmente si se trata de personas jóvenes, hasta arritmias graves o potencialmente graves, especialmente en personas que tienen alguna enfermedad como ser obstruciones en las coronarias, o hipertensión arterial que ya ha generado repercusión en el corazón, u otras enfermedades que se ven a edades mayores. El síntoma de tener una arritmia es sentir palpitaciones, o un latido que se adelanta y luego una pausa, o un mareo o malestar, si esto se produce, es necesario hacer una consulta para que el cardiólogo le haga un chequeo completo que incluirá un estudio de electrocardiograma de 24 horas (Holter), o un estudio de electrocardiograma en esfuerzo (ergometría), y también un ecocardiograma que es un estudio no invasivo que se hace con un gel en el pecho que nos muestra las imágenes de como está el corazón y como se mueve. Pero en una persona joven las arritmias más comunes son las llamadas extrasístoles auriculares o ventriculares, y se producen por exceso de café, de té, de mate, o por esfuerzo físico inadecuado para el grado de entrenamiento, o por no descansar bien, y ni que hablar si la persona fuma o ingiere otro tipo de sustancias tóxicas. Ahí entonces estamos frente a un problema serio ya que podemos ver arritmias graves por consumo de cocaína, y vemos infarto de corazón en jóvenes de 20 a?os, cosa que nunca habíamos visto, y esto lo consigue la cocaína. <br>  Pero si no estuviera presente ninguna de estas causas, el chequeo que le hará el médico seguramente le dará normal, y no pasará esto de un susto, pero viene bien para disponer ya de un chequeo normal que servirá de comparación para futuros chequeos.<br>  Con respecto a la donación de sangre con arritmia, depende del tipo, si fuera una arritmia común, no hay problema, pero primero hay que chequearlo para saber de que arritmia se trata. Si fuera una arritmia de cuidado, hay que tratarla, y no es conveniente que done en esa circunstancia. Con respecto a la manera de tratar las arritmias, dependerá de la causa. Muchas de las arritmias de los jóvenes se tratan eliminando la causa que la produce, (suspender el café muy cargado o suplantarlo por descafeínado), si fueran sustancias tóxicas, elimanarlas, si es por estrés hacer una terapia o un cambio de la forma como se encaran las situaciones dificiles. Y si fuera una causa orgánica, cada arritmia tiene su tratamiento específico que va desde medicamentos hasta tratamientos muy modernos y muy efectivos que no sería conveniente estar hablando de ellos, porque esperemos que todo sea benigno como es lo más frecuente en personas jóvenes.<br>  UN saludo y mucha suerte<br>  <br>  aqui hay otra repuesta <br>  <br>   Voy a tratar de no complicar la respuesta con nombres raros para que entiendas, el electrocardiograma es un estudio de rutina, también se pide cuando una persona se hace un chequeo general, es un estudio simple que dura solo unos minutos, el médico puede a traves de el, evaluar la actividad del corazón con cada latido, se lo han indicado ya que si tiene arritmia y dona sangre, podria producirse una descompensación al momento de hacerlo y en lugar de donar sangre lo tendrian que atender a él, no debe preocuparse pero como dce el refrán, si ocuparse, debe ser evaluado por un cardiólogo, le pediran estudios complementarios y con eso le indicarán el tratamiento, seguramente alguna medicación, y controles, las causas de la arritmia pueden ser varias, desde un estado de nerviocismo, stress, hasta una medicación lo puede causar, pero eso lo determinará el cardiologo cuando reuna los datos de su historia clínica.

Mucha suerte<br>  Saludos|`|9LQ78OZIaa	El término repolarización temprana o repolarización precoz, se da en personas en general jóvenes y en general deportistas que tienen un predominio vagotónico (del tono parasimpático del corazón), que hace que la repolarización se haga más rápidamente que lo habitual, y al producirse muy rápidamente, simula, o evoca alteraciones como las que se ven en las personas que tienen isquemia del corazón por obstrucciones coronarias.<br>  Lo importante de estas personas es saber que tienen una "repolarización precoz" y andar siempre con un electrocardiograma encima de ellos, porque de lo contrario cada vez que le hacen un nuevo electrocardiograma, el médico lo va a querer internar para pedirle enzimas cardíacas, porque la imagen es muy similar a la de una persona que está por hacer un infarto, pero no tiene nada.<br>  Por otra parte el término trastornos de repolarización, son un grupo de alteraciones en el electrocardiograma que se producen por muchas causas, la más común en personas de mediana edad o mayores son las alteraciones isquémicas que nos orientan a descartar obstruciones coronarias, pero hay otras causas, desde la hipertensión arterial que ya ha producido engrosamiento del ventrículo izquierdo hasta las alteraciones valvulares tipo estenosis aórtica u otras causas cardíacas o extracardíacas como las alteraciones de los iones que también pueden dar trastornos de repolarización.<br>  En suma: Repolarización temprana o repolarización precoz es algo completamente benigno que da una pseudoimagen que puede confundir o preocupar inicialmente al equipo médico hasta que se confirma que es eso.<br>  Trastornos de repolarización se dividen en leves moderados o severos, y pueden ser transitorios y completamente inocuos a otros que nos puedan poner en camino de alguna enfermedad subyacente.<br>  Mucha suerte

Get a consultation from an expert immediately.|`|G4FPx1yDaa	There is an eye condition which by irony is called "dry eyes". Seems silly when the eyes are watery, but its usually because the the eye surface is not holding the tear it needs to keep it lubricated, so the eye produces excessive tears.  It is often hormonal...sometimes post menopausal and there is a product called Sustain, which will help to rebuild the eye surface so it can hold the natural tear better.  Consider seeing an optometrist or ophthamologist to properly diagnose the condition.  It could just be that you are in an air conditioned area which dries the eyes out causing excess tears for the same reason as above...or even out in the wind can cause it.  good luck|`|6kTefQa5aa	Well do you have any pent up anger/fear/depression? because usually that could make you cry at random times.<br>  Its happened to me before o.o

Para reducir la tensión en estos dos puntos, la antigimnasia propone una serie de fáciles ejercicios que se pueden realizar en casa: <br>  Movimiento para los pies <br>  tranquilizarse y respirar pausadamente. Primero debe quitarse zapatos y calcetines, y sentarse en el suelo o en un taburete. Poner el pie derecho sobre el muslo izquierdo. En lo posible, hay que procurar que el pie derecho esté en el eje de la pierna. Introducir los dedos de la mano izquierda entre los dedos del pie derecho. <br>  <br>  Debe flexionar los dedos del pie para ver las cinco protuberancias en la parte de arriba del pie. Para ayudarse puede tocar con los dedos de su mano entre las protuberancias. Después, separar con suavidad los dedos del pie y de la mano. Antes de cambiar de pie, conviene caminar descalzo. <br>  <br>  Movimiento para los hombros <br>  Sentarse sobre una silla de manera relajada y con las manos sobre los muslos. Realizar una serie de aspiraciones de aire. Descansar la mano izquierda sobre el hombre derecho, haciendo contacto entre la parte hueca de la mano y el redondo del hombro. Girar despacio la mano. Deslizarla sobre la parte alta del brazo, y realizar peque?as presiones con la palma (no con los dedos), sin apretar. <br>  <br>  Una vez se termina un brazo, hay que ponerse de pie con los brazos colgando, y los efectos son inmediatos, notando esa parte del cuerpo trabajada mucho más relajada, la cara, el ojo, el hombro.|`|b4cb719004fa0608b9ccccc93cc45a53aa	me recomendaron usar:<br>  - una silla estilo "lisa simpson"... no se si alguna vez la viste, es una banqueta que quedas como arrodillada... parece mentira pero en seguida te enderezas...<br>  - fortalecer los musculos de la espalda mediante ejercicios con una barra...<br>  - este ultimo fue de vieja (no profesional)... hay en el mercado, una especie de faja con dos elasticos gruesos que pasan por sobre los hombros, tirandolos para atras...

IXvhfFQZaa	I don't think I would be going in a public jacuzzi unless I knew I was the first one in!! As relaxing as it can be, I would be insane with worry about pH, bacteria, the last time it had been cleaned...not to mention wondering if the jacuzzi at the club is the only bathing ritual Ms. July has...ewwww.|`|TrmqrfQDaa	um...going in any gym jacuzzi is gross. if you were grossed out over her nakedness its a sign to NOT GO IN. just stay away from public jacuzzi. this is where bacteria live. imagine all of that swimming "inside" you. <br>  <br>  she can wear whatever she wants. its up to you if you want to be a part of that.|`|YXjhhLXUaa	that IS wrong. its public indecency and its against the law.|`|nv6ruv18aa	Oh hell, that's naasty!<br>  Yes she should - ick :s<br>  Is there any policy at the gym about that?|`|0cWIAiw6aa	You guys make it seem like the water doesn't get under the bathing suit <.<.<br>  <br>  Anyways the chlorine kills all the bacteria, so you're basically sitting in a pool of dead skin.

The only difference is that you would see her "naked-ness"|`|irsuHPf3aa	wear a bathing suit.<br>  all I have to say.<br>  :)|`|mzWnHsixaa	when i go i always wear a bathing suit...|`|79e4b3c6bff1c064ae45299e8ee84170aa	public nudity is against the law. lol that is so weird. i don't know why anyone would just hop in naked. eww. people these days... I would ask someone in charge about the policy for jacuzzi use. usually gyms are pretty strict about that kinda stuff.

h95uFEBpaa	Ciao!<br>  Io soffro spesso d'insonnia, e ho sperimentato che per ottenere buoni risultati nel contrastarla è utile agire su più fronti.<br>  Innanzitutto, è d'obbligo imparare a rilassarsi: a volte pensiamo così tanto e con intensità tale da non esserne coscienti, sicchè si produce in noi una carica di stress che ci mantiene in una veglia forzata.<br>  Quando ti metti sotto il tuo piumotto, lascia tutto fuori, lascia fuori pensieri e tormenti, cocentarti sulla morbidezza delle coperte, il profumo delle lenzuola. Aiuta molto fare una doccia calda con un buon bagno schiuma profumato.<br>  <br>  Puoi aiutarti con una tisana: ne vendono moltissime anche al supermercato, con un prezzo modestissimo puoi acquistarne secondo i tuoi gusti, di solito è chiaramente indicato che si tratta di tisane rilassanti per favorire il sonno notturno.<br>  <br>  A tutto ciò unisci dei pasti serali leggeri, se devi mangiare cose pesanti fallo a pranzo!<br>  <br>  Più impegnativo, ma dai risultati più fermi è praticare attività sportiva: da quando pratico nuoto, le sere che vado in piscine i muscoli sono più rilassati, alla stanchezza mentale fa da contrappeso quella fisica, risultato: il bisogno di un riposo integrale, induce naturalmente il sonno.<br>  <br>  La valeriana, in gocce o compressine, è un  buon rimedio per le sere più difficili.<br>  <br>  Per esperienza ti dico che una vita equilibrata è condizione necessaria per un buon sonno... devi crearti i tuoi ritmi e rispettarli; ma soprattutto rispettarti.<br>  <br>  Un bacione,<br>  Buona notte e sogni d'oro ;)!|`|293l8qUzaa	Hai provato a contare le pecore che saltano la staccionata ???<br>  <br>  Uno, due, tre, quattro, cinque....|`|5PWHSlPYaa	anke io soffro di insonnia.. x dormire la sera mi bevo una bella tazza di camomilla.. così x mezza notte sto a nanna!!|`|Fj6yjtEzaa	una bella tisana di valeriana....e poi unaa bella giornata di relax senza pensieri e preoccupazioni...baci|`|GwdR9667aa	botta in testa...<br>  o<br>  ..mezz'ora nel mio ufficio...<br>  <br>  per Mirko ..se è un buon libro nn dovrebbe farla dormire...<br>  ...SVEGLIA!!!|`|fVchv8yraa	Cercare di non fare attività pesanti la sera (studiare, fare palestra ecc) ma rilassarsi, e ovviamente niente caffè, alcolici, cioccolato..latte caldo e miele o tisana di camomilla, tiglio o passiflora..e se non serve neanche quello prendi gocce o pastigliette di valeriana che trovi in farmacia..sono un sedativo naturale utilissime in caso di insonnia!!|`|Jaekqymaaa	le caramelle alla valeriana..... funzionano di brutto|`|oczKIghRaa	un'ottima camomilla e se non dovesse funzionare prendi delle pillole o gocce in erboristeria...sono tutte cose naturali....e riuscirai anche a dormire...cmq magari stai + tranquillo e rilassato..che spesso sono proprio queste le cause dell'insonnia...|`|sfDi21G9aa	potresti provare con la melatonina. la usano i piloti per il jet lag. oppure la melissa, valeriana, camomilla. in caso potresti informarti anche su qualche rimedio omeopatico, o fare degli esercizi di rilassamento e respirazione....in bocca al lupo! so quant'è brutto non riuscire a dormire|`|yjYi1UXwaa	leggiti un buon libro.....vedrai che il sonno arriva!
7f19382fac2ad8f7bd8cdf9d2f73c3d8aa	I just started reading the book titled "Eat to Live" by Joel Fuhrman M.D. He also runs a website drfuhrman.com.<br>  <br>  The basic premise of the diet is that you fill up healthy plant-based foods. It's impossible to get too many calories if your diet.<br>  <br>  My breakfast is oatmeal or cereal + an orange or pear.<br>  Lunch is a fresh salad + 2 servings of fresh fruit<br>  Dinner is either legumes or another salad.<br>  Occasionally, I'll add 5 ounces white-meat chicken or fish to my dinner.<br>  <br>  I generally do a 30-45 minute work out after breakfast but before my morning shower.|`|8GRm9ikBaa	Try the magnetic diet.

AA10242125	Get checked by a doctor. It may be asthma.|`|cTlBjz7Caa	Firstly, are you out of breath easily?

You really need another perspective, another<br>  way of looking at life, instead of what you have been focusing on.<br>  God created you, he knew you before the foundation of the<br>  earth.

May God richly bless you!!|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	asking strangers our opinion is a good clue  they need counseling depression is high chemical dependency is key   if your questioning where you'll end up  I would say talk to a pastor  or a priest  , cause the bible says come to me who are heavy laden and i will give you rest that means PRAY and confess and change your path , by sharing  the gospel of JC and help others so they don't end up in hell where they denied  him so <br>  I would think more about my parents and the financial burden  funeral expenses etc  cleaning out your room starting a new life its excruciating to live life feeling  like a failor to your child  and what ifs <br>  so who are you helping? noone your only hurting others and yourself cause you can't guarantee you will succeed and could end up in a vegetative state or TBI and live life in a worse way with no way out  , so i would say check yourself into the hospital and get help <br>  <br>  God helps those who help themselves,  
12TtrXSKaa	If you're a guy it can decrease your sperm count.  If you're a pregnant female, it can hurt the baby, even end the pregnancy.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Since you don't say if you are a guy or a girl; I will tell you if you are a guy and you take a very hot bath you can affect your sperm for the next day or so.<br>  Sperm can only exist within a small temperature range and hot water exceeds that quite a bit.

If she wasn't comfortable with the fact that she's going to see penises of all shapes, sizes, etc. then she wouldn't be in the line of work she's in.<br>  <br>  If you want to avoid getting an erection during the exam, try concentrating on something really random. Count the number of bumps in the ceiling or try doing hard math, like squaring every number from 1 to 100. You'll be focusing on the tedious task, so you won't even notice that the exam's going on...|`|vRGU7J76aa	A doctor is aware of the possibility of erection and knows it is quite a natural and physical response of any male body when touched at private parts by a woman.

For a little variety why not add the occasional swimming or dancing to your exercise routine? <br>  <br>  Please though, don't start counting calories or cutting out carbs.. At 13 you need to follow a balanced diet and your current exercise routine uses up quite a few calories.  The best thing would be to speak to your Mum and see if you could have less fatty foods and more fresh fruit and vegetables - and avoid soft fizzy drinks, water is much better! <br>  <br>   The following websites are about body types and bone structure:-<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Abravanel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Abra...</a> <br>  <a href="http://diet.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Ideal_Weight_Calculator" rel="nofollow">http://diet.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Ideal_We...</a><br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|77Ttlz4Uaa	Actually, your BMI is 25.5 and that is only .5 above an ideal weight, and plus, your a girl, so you probably have puppy fat and this will go as you grow, but only if you eat healthily, x|`|lhUIevnuaa	you didnt mention what you eat, is it alot? is it fatty? do you eat alot of snacks?|`|tsfbV5PPaa	Try to eat healthier and exercise slightly more if you don't think its too much...

DnF4WJLiaa	First, stop taking the Hoodia. It has not been given FDA approval yet. It may or may not affect your strength, by why wait to find out? <br>  <br>  In my opinion, I say who cares what the other girls look like. I calculated your BMI based on the info you gave and you are Completely Normal! I know its hard, but work on your self-confidence. Talk with a good friend and be supportive of each other. Chances are she (or he!) has some issues she would like to talk over as well. :) Your friends can be the support you need to succeed and gain confidence! You can do it!<br>  <br>  As far as the weight goes, calculate your BMI yourself with the link below and make sure you don't lose too much weight in order to "look pretty." Being overly skinny isn't any more attractive than being slightly overweight. And based on your BMI, you are just fine!<br>  <br>  Try this website to calculate your BMI:<br>  <br>  The National Institute of Health:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nhlbisupport.com/bmi/" rel="nofollow">http://nhlbisupport.com/bmi/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Eat healthy foods, and a variety of them to boot. Stay away from foods high in saturated fats.<br>  <br>  You do plenty of exercise by swimming, so I wouldn't recommend any more. Its important to exercise, but don't overdo it! Make sure to eat plenty of protein, because your body will use that as energy before it uses the fat. It gets the protein from your muscles, so in order to replace what is used then make sure to eat an adequate amount, be it from meat or vegetable proteins.<br>  <br>  Most importantly:<br>  <br>  Be confident in yourself and enjoy who you are! Good luck! :)|`|8f7f281507dafb2a2226f95ec9a3a666aa	I'm not sure what "hoodia" is...but anything you take to loose weight will only work for a short time....and then your body will kick back in....don't mess with your metabolism because it eventually will have to go back to normal.....just find natural ways to do it...|`|eHKFhApVaa	you are fine for your height<br>  dont think too much about <br>  <br>  and do not take any pills or whatnot<br>  here is the thing<br>  do more exercises and drink plenty of water<br>  trust me, not eating will make you sick and weak<br>  <br>  stay with your swimming and water polo you will be fine<br>  also you might be most muscle and less fat type of girl<br>  so trust me<br>  <br>  those 95lbs girls are envious of you =)|`|BYZzeIrQaa	Did you lose weight or no?

You're too young anyway. If you really want to lose weight then start eating healthy foods and run a couple times a week. you're already swimming so that burns tons of calories anyway.|`|Okbgwq1faa	Those girls that weigh 95lbs also don't have any muscles like you do.  If you are as active as you say then you probably have a lot of muscle.  I love the look of a woman with more muscle rather than a skinny little sickly looking girl!  You would be surprised if you had a body fat test and they did and they probably have more body fat than you do!  I don't think your weight is too high for your height.  Swimming and water polo burn alot of calories and if you cut down too much then you won't feel well and will probably lose strength.  You should consult a dietician or a professional trainer.  They could help you with a proper diet customed to your lifestyle and help you keep your strength and lose a few pounds if that is necessary.  Be proud of the strong girl you are, you should be proud of yourself and not worry about a few pounds.  I bet you look great!|`|RIHXl5Dgaa	dont worry, youre fine. i hate the way i look but at least im healthy. cut down on the pills, dont quit cold-turkey or there might be side-effects and quit when you think you've hit a small enough dose.|`|RXUdaJlRaa	eat healthy and keep excersizing. Dont cheat yourself either. Stick to what your doing at it will eventually pay off...<br>  <br>  Also, your very young. When I was your age, I was really fat. I grew a bit and lost a ton of weight somehow. and for your size, you dont sound like your overweight or anything...<br>  <br>  Above all, just be yourself. I think thats what makes a person.

Just be yourself|`|ZGnK91Y5aa	Well...You are tall.|`|fyXM3KYHaa	lose weight the natural way.  don't try quick fixes.  thats not healthy at all.  if you cared about yourself like you should, you wouldn't do that to your body.  try more exercising and changing the way you eat.<br>  <br>  you have to change the way you live.|`|ikGHlOrLaa	Work on the problems inside first, then take on the imperfections of your body.  I tried tackling body first, psyche later, and I'm in a deeper whole than I was before.  Don't take hoodia.  Just do your best to move around a lot, maybe exercise, and eat right.  Try to avoid high fat foods and always read the nutrition facts and serving size.  Good luck; I hope you feel better about yourself soon and are able to pursue the body you are after.  Don't forget the serenity prayer.  I'm practically a satanist and i think the serenity prayer is a damn good prayer.|`|nqaCxIUQaa	everyone hates the way they look at 14!  as an athlete, you need to be eating healthy food and appreciate that you have a strong, agile body!  female athletes are not scrawny unless they are 12-year-old gymnasts with mean coachs!|`|wpEzYcOmaa	First of all know that muscle weighs more than fat.  It's sounds like you're very active so that may be the weight...it's muscle...don't look at the numbers on the scale. You can be a 150 lb size 8 because you're muscle or you could also be 150lb size 18...not much muscle.<br>  <br>  for your age height and weight...you are average.  Don't go taking supplement ts or drugs....they are not something you want to take your whole life are they? but you would have to to keep the weight off.  the only way to lose it for good is very slowly...a lb to two lbs a week. I have tried every diet know to man...and the only one that worked is Weight Watchers...I lost 70 lbs and have kept it off...now I am going to go back and lose the other 40 I wanted to.<br>  <br>  good luck!

ripvOi5jaa	Use cool cloths on burned areas.<br>  Take frequent cool showers or baths.<br>  Apply soothing lotions that contain aloe vera to burned areas to relieve pain and swelling. Applying 0.5% hydrocortisone cream to the burned area also may help.|`|gMzGP7KWaa	No the burn has to burn out. To get some relief just get a glass of ice water and stick the finger in it only when you can stand the burning anymore then take it out. Should only take a few hrs but eventually it will stop. You can get some over the counter lidocaine sprays that numb the burn if you need them. Good luck I know it hurts but I asssure you this works. |`|BAapKykEaa	Household remedies that I know of are:<br>  <br>  Toothpaste<br>  Ketchup (that's been in the refrigerator)<br>  <br>  If it blisters up (a big bubble) don't pop it. By popping it you increase your chances of infection.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon.|`|Ht3aAyoUaa	OUCH duude. umm i think if it hurts to keep an ice cube on it, Get a cup of ice water and keep ur whole finger in there till it numbs. Then a band aid after. in my opinion.|`|bSSLIgpyaa	I would suggest toothbrush paste. It might work or might not...considering how badly you are burned. <br>  ( but it work for me...many times... hope it help)|`|AA10167903	Burn salve would work best- medicines are a lot better than just ice. |`|YXqIKiMYaa	Burn ointment with LIDOCAINE (2% is an effective concentration).
2mcDKo4Naa	When you cough a lot for an extended period, you're not getting enough oxygen as you would if you were breathing normally....and that causes feelings of faintness/dizziness/shortness of breath, etc. <br>  <br>  Is it possible you're having an asthma attack? (go in to the doctor right away if you suspect that)<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you try to relax and breathe deeply, and you should feel fine.<br>  <br>  If you still feel faint after a while (like an hour from now...or sooner if it's freaking you out) I'd go in to emerg and have them sort things out.|`|gYnWC3Cuaa	click on this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom-checker/DS00671" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom...</a>

QDZqKAOmaa	Yes, as a matter of fact, it appears that the timing and duration of some childhood allergies are changing. Allergies for example to peanuts, milk and eggs once thought to disappear by age three or four, are persisting into adolescence and beyond.

You don't want to have too much of bread (any bread, even wholewheat), less potatoes, rice, etc. Definitely avoid sugar and all the sweets. Eat smaller portions but more often, about 5-7 small meals a day. Good luck(:

You can do that by following a diet plan or doing it yourself.  Structure and discipline from a diet will probably be more effective, since you don't have a lot of time.  Now, the key is finding the best diet plan for you.  A lot of diets do work, but every diet will not work for everyone.  You need to find the diet that is right for you.<br>  <br>  Check out this article on how to choose the right diet for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dietstop10.com/choosing-the-right-diet-for-you" rel="nofollow">http://www.dietstop10.com/choosing-the-r...</a>|`|AA10189392	Get a plan that moderates your eating but doesn't starve you.  Combine it with a moderate exercise plan that gets you up and sweating, but doesn't kill you.  Be disciplined to eat what your plan says and go to the gym when you're supposed to.  Take pride in going when you don't want to, but DO go.  Stay away from the scale.  Then, set out to "just win the battle today," and worry about tomorrow when tomorrow gets here.

I know this may sound difficult but its really a lot more easier than you think.

Practice breathing exercises and most importantly, never be too afraid to ask for help. Get plenty of sleep but maintain healthy regular patterns, Exercise increases endomorphines- the happiness drug of your brain. Do things you love and stay away from negative people.

Maybe you lost a dog as a child, or you feel bad about being happy.  What ever it is, let your self process the emotions.  Take GOOD care of yourself, do something just for you.  Remember you are the most important person in your life and you must take care of YOU!  Take it hour by hour, or if you can day by day.  Know that tomorrow may just be a little brighter.

bc134259905b450308adcfa76631e203aa	Connective tissue diseases such as Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis feature abnormal immune system response that then reacts with the collagen and elastin in the joints.  Treatments then work to suppress the immune system to stop the damage in the joints.  One example of this is Etanercept (Enbrel) which is indicated for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.  This specific drug mediates the immune response <br>  by inhibiting TNF activity through competitively binding to it and thus  preventing interaction with cell surface reactors.  This shuts down inflammation.  <br>  <br>  In patients with immunosuppressive disease turning down inflammation in compromised patients would mean there would be no defense against foreign bodies.

0VZlZuP5aa	I have been doing Nutrisystem since Sept 1, 2007.  When I started I had 70 pounds to lose.  It's now 7 months later and I've lost 63 pounds, only 7 to go.  I've struggled with weight my entire adult life and Nutrisystem has worked better for me than anything else.  The convenience and structure along with the online support they provide has been really good.  <br>  <br>  This was my second time on Nutrisystem.  I did it once about 20 years ago, successfully losing the 40 pounds I needed to.  Unfortunately I didnt follow through and maintain, fell back into old bad eating habits and over 20 years gained more than all of it back.  This time I know I need to think about maintenance afterwards too.  I'd suggest that for anyone who has had an ongoing struggle with weight like mine.  <br>  <br>  If you do decide to go with Nutrisystem email me at ctz1057@yahoo.com before you sign up and order and I can have them email you a coupon code which will save you $30 off your first monthly food order.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck however you decide to proceed to try to lose the weight you want.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	My opinion: Yuck<br>  Here are some reviews<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diet-blog.com/archives/2005/11/15/nutrisystem_a_complete_review.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.diet-blog.com/archives/2005/1...</a>|`|nCV79uqfaa	I am currently on Nutrisystem- and LOVE IT!  Its been the first "diet" plan that has actually worked.  I started on January 7th of this year and I'm down 30 pounds!  The plan is a little on the pricey side- averaging about $300 a month, but its totally worth it.  There are ways to reduce the cost- sign up for autodelivery, "buddy bucks" (I can give you info about those), and than they have ways to get 10 dollars of future orders, things like that- but the food is good, and pretty easy to stick to! Good luck with your decision!

N752G6zcaa	Did you know that your Diet should be based on your Blood type .<br>  <br>  Your blood type is the key that unlocks the door to the mysteries of health, disease, longevity, physical vitality and emotional strength. Your blood type determines your susceptibility to illness, which foods you should eat and how you should exercise. It is a factor in your energy levels, the efficiency with which you burn calories, your<br>  emotional response to stress and perhaps even your personality.<br>  <br>  Breakthrough came with the discovery that two major diseases of the<br>  stomach were associated with blood type. The first was the peptic ulcer, a condition often related to higher than average stomach acid levels. This condition was reported to be more common in people with Type O blood than in people with other blood types. I was<br>  immediately intrigued, since my father had observed that Type O patients did well on animal products and protein diets--foods that require more stomach acid for proper digestion.<br>  <br>  Blood type analysis offered a powerful means of interpreting individual variations in health and disease. Given the amount of available research data, it is surprising that the effects of blood type on our health have not received the measure of attention that they deserve.<br>  <br>  Do know what to eat based on your blood group<br>  <a href="http://www.diskovery.co.in/how_to_loose_weight__how_to_gain_weight" rel="nofollow">http://www.diskovery.co.in/how_to_loose_...</a>|`|i8CVrwiTaa	telling us your current weight and height would help.<br>  but yeah i would say run an hour a day|`|gISj3gIRaa	Do alot of crunches like 100 a day and get good work outs.

yhC7aa6faa	That is a very provocative question; is causes one to be far more introspective. While you contemplate this in general terms as specific details are not given, my answer will also be of a general nature.<br>  <br>  Of course, one important consideration would be the doctor’s estimate of the 5 years survival rate or other time frame if 5 years is not consistent with the deadly disease. Also, I would want to know if the disease is progressive or would sudden death occur. For instance, some types of bone cancer cause such severe pain that even the strongest narcotics are not sufficient to eliminate the suffering. Alternatively, some types of progressive heart disease such as heart failure do not produce the debilitating pain but cause a diminishing of the person’s ability to function in ordinary activities. <br>  <br>  After reviewing the potential medical progression I would then do my best to accomplish whatever I am able for others. <br>  <br>  One fundamental concept of which I believe is that espoused by the late Albert Pike; he said, “What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal”. This belief would cause me to seek out and help others who are deemed worthy. What criteria would I use to determine worthiness? A fundamental basis would be the person’s honesty for without a belief in what they tell me, nothing else matters. In my life thus far I have met others from all income and status groups who are 100% honest in their dealings with others. From the richest to the very poorest these fine people always deal honestly even though at times it seems contrary to their own needs. <br>  <br>  In addition, I have met a very small percentage of people who misrepresent the truth, hide the facts, mislead or evade the truth; while others actually lie so easily that they become pathological in the true textbook concept. Once someone is proved to be dishonest then everything they say is suspect. <br>  <br>  Naturally, the more untruths that are discovered the less creditably they have so I would deem these poor unfortunate people as undeserving of any help whatsoever. Sadly, the ones who are most untruthful are usually the ones who need the most financial assistance since this lack of truthfulness pervades every aspect of their lives and this causes them to fail at almost everything they attempt from business plans to marital status. These poor souls cannot understand why bad things seem to always happen to them but the most successful never seem to have these problems because others know that their word is their bond and you can rely on their statements.<br>  <br>  After I decided on who would benefit from my estate and prepared the legal papers so that it would be distributed properly, I would then begin a very through self-examination. <br>  <br>  My many faults would be examined and my intent would be to acknowledge them and ask our Creator for forgiveness. My religion teaches that ALL have sinned and fallen short of God’s expectations. However, there is a way out for One so Great exists Who takes all of our sins as if they never happened. Once that happens the load of human frailty is lifted and true happiness seems to explode from inside.<br>  <br>  From Psalms, 91st Chapter of the Holy Bible are some meaningful and appropriate promises:<br>  <br>  Psalms 91 (King James Version)<br>  <br>  1: He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. <br>  2: I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. <br>  3: Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. <br>  4: He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. <br>  5: Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; <br>  6: Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. <br>  7: A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. <br>  8: Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. <br>  9: Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; <br>  10: There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. <br>  11: For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. <br>  12: They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. <br>  13: Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. <br>  14: Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. <br>  15: He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. <br>  16: With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. <br>  <br>  And also the promises of the next to the last chapter of Revelation:<br>  <br>  Revelation, chapter 21<br>  <br>  1: And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. <br>  2: And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <br>  3: And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. <br>  4: And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. <br>  5: And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. <br>  6: And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. <br>  7: He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.<br>  <br>  In summation, my belief is that a discussion of a dread disease that is determined to be fatal soon cannot be contemplated without the realization of one’s faith and practice. Since eternity is soon to occur, I would definitely want to get right with God so that he would welcome me into paradise. A wonderful way to express my beliefs is as follows:<br>  <br>  “Then, when at last, your weary feet shall have come to the end of life's toil-some journey, and, from your nerveless grasp, shall drop, forever, the working tools of life, may the record of your life and actions be pure and spotless; and when your soul, freed from earth, shall stand naked and alone before the Great White Throne, may it be your portion to hear from Him who sits thereon, the welcome plaudit: Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!"|`|AA11539119	It would all depend on the deadly disease.  How long do I have to live?  Are the symptoms bad?  Can I still move?  My attitude wouldn't change.  I would still laugh and love.  I would make sure not to miss a moment of my children's life.  Cherish every moment with my husband.  Mostly keep a positive attitude.  What about you?|`|kzUeNFoeaa	I don't really know but for me it would be hard to cope with it.

jWssapl3aa	I believe it makes you gain some weight if your not actively using up those carbs/sugar. I have a can right next 2 me i just finish drinking cuz i'm pregnant but not really gaining any weight yet. It has 47 grams of sugar (almost the amount of 2 cans of soda) and 52 grams of carbs. I used to drink it when i was like 5 yrs old & the doctor told my mom 2 stop feeding it to me cuz i was putting on some weight Lol almost got to the husky side of things... Ultimately, if you use up the carbs through exercise you won't gain any weight, you'll maintain it.|`|8N3IYhSVaa	There are plenty of better options in there, the last time I took a look at it.

It's because they keep your mouth dry. The same thing happens with asthma type inhalers.   So keep on drinking the water and check any meds you take to see if that's where it's coming from. Chewing sugarless gum helps a lot because it keeps your mouth moist. Oh yeah, don't forget to brush and/or scrape your tongue. You can buy a tongue scraper at any department or drug store.

9d2ybjHcaa	Existen dos tipos de virus rábico (2 especies): virus FIJO o de laboratorio y virus CALLE o natural.<br>  El virus FIJO se aísla del cerebro de animales (por pasajes seriados intra cerebrales. Es mas virulento, posee menor periodo de incubación. <br>  El virus CALLE se aísla de cerebros de animales (perro, gato, murciélago). <br>  El virus invade las glándulas salivales e induce la formación de corpúsculos de Negri en el cerebro.<br>  <br>  PUERTA DE ENTRADA<br>  Vía transcutánea, generalmente por mordedura del animal enfermo. Mucho menos frecuente son las vías respiratoria, digestiva o subcutánea. <br>  El virus se replica en el músculo de la herida, aumentando así la carga viral. Luego ingresa al axón a través del huso neuromuscular. Por un proceso llamado SEPTINEURITIS inicia el camino hacia el SNC, utilizando la raíz dorsal del nervio involucrado para tal fin. Llega al SNC por la metámera medular correspondiente al sitio de la mordedura.<br>  En el cerebro produce edema y congestión vascular, infiltración linfática e hiperemia de las leptomeninges o meninges blandas (aracnoides y píamadre) vecinas.<br>  El virus invade neuronas produciendo neurólisis y neurofagia. Se forman nódulos de BABES. <br>  <br>  EPIDEMIOLOGíA <br>  En América del sur predomina la rabia humana trasmitida por perros, con algunos casos de rabia por murciélagos. El 70 % de los pacientes corresponden al sexo masculino.<br>  Los miembros superiores son las mas frecuentemente mordidos, luego le siguen los miembros inferiores, la cara y cuello y por último el tronco. Hay que tener en cuenta que a veces la herida puede ser mínima.<br>  <br>  CLINICA<br>  INCUBACIóN: Es asintomática, dura entre 10 y 80 días con una media de 42.<br>  INVASIóN o PRODRóMICO: Dura de 3 a 6 días. Cursa con un síndrome infeccioso indiferenciado constituido por cefaleas, hipertermia, dolor retro ocular, astenia, anorexia y mialgias. Hay parestesias en el lugar de la  mordedura. Sobre el final de este período se suman: odinofagia, vómitos, nauseas, irritabilidad, desasosiego, insomnio, fonofobia y fotofobia.<br>  PERIODO DE ESTADO: Dura 3 a 7 días. Se exacerban los síntomas del periodo de invasión, agregándose crisis hidrofóbica, disnea, contracturas musculares, cianosis e hipertermia (40 – 41 Grados). Por último se instala el cuadro de encefalitis o encéfalomielitis con parálisis progresiva que comienza por los miembros inferiores y va ascendiendo rápidamente.     <br>  <br>  DIAGNóSTICO<br>  Presunción clínica por historia de mordedura.<br>  Laboratorio: técnicas de inmunofluorescencia (se procesa en el día y es muy sensible y específica).<br>  La prueba concluyente es el aislamiento  en ratones a los que se inocula, en el cerebro, un macerado del material sospechoso. Es el único método que permite la confirmación etiológica. Tarda 3 semanas.<br>  <br>  TRATAMIENTO<br>  La herida deberá lavarse con agua y jabón, secarse y pintar con povidona. Se indicará tratamiento antibiótico y profilaxis anti tetánica.<br>  Tratamiento Específico: administrar vacuna antirrábica mas suero antirrábico específico (en situaciones clínicas o epidemiológicas específicas).<br>  La inmunización es la única terapia efectiva en el paciente infectado. La vacuna no solo actúa como prevención (como todas las vacunas) sino que también produce la curación cuando se la administra inmediatamente después de ingresado el virus.<br>  No existe antibiótico ni quimioterapia efectiva contra el virus. Todo paciente en períodos de invasión y estado son pacientes terminales.<br>  El período eficaz para administrar la vacuna (periodo efectivo) decrece a cero a los diez días. Lo ideal es administrarlo el mismo día de la exposición.<br>  Por lo general se dan 14 dosis (1 por día) y dos dosis de refuerzo, una a los 10 días  de finalizada la dosis 14 y otra a los 20 días.<br>  El suero antirrábico se utiliza en mordeduras graves o situaciones epidemiológicas específicas.|`|2941VObSaa	rabiosos ha?ha?ha?|`|XVl8n1B4aa	VETE AL MEDICO ???YA, YA, YA!!!|`|Z5lJCZAYaa	no hay que esperar los sintomas, tenes que vacunarte de urgencia, esa enfermedad es mortal si no se trata a tiempo|`|r2TOurgSaa	A mi me mordió un perro rabioso cuando tenía dos a?os, mi papá le dió un golpe para poder llevarlo al veterinario y gracias a eso me salvaron, sé que me dieron pinchazos por todos lados, y el médico dijo que sufriría de los nervios, pero estoy bastante normal!!!|`|5FSBkIbHaa	Cuáles son los síntomas de la rabia?<br>  <br>  Entre los primeros síntomas se encuentran la irritabilidad, el dolor de cabeza, la fiebre y en algunos casos, picazón o dolor en el lugar de la exposición. Con el paso de los días, la enfermedad provoca parálisis, espasmos de los músculos de la garganta, convulsiones, delirio y finalmente, la muerte.<br>  <br>  ?Cuánto después de la exposición surgen los síntomas?<br>  El periodo de incubación (es decir, el tiempo que transcurre entre la exposición al virus y la aparición de los síntomas) es variable, aunque suele ser de dos a ocho semanas. Se han informado casos de periodos de incubación de más de un a?o.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  La rabia en el hombre<br>  <br>  El hombre recibe el virus de la rabia a través del contado con la saliva del animal enfermo. Esto quiere decir, que para ser inoculado, no necesita necesariamente ser mordido: basta que un tajo, herida, rasgu?o profundo o quemadura en su piel entren en contacto con la saliva del animal rabioso. Pero no importa cuál se la forma de penetración: el virus se dirige siempre al sistema nervioso central.<br>  <br>  El tiempo de inoculación varia con la naturaleza del virus, el lugar de inoculación y la cantidad inoculada.- Si el punto de contacto ha sido la cabeza, el cuello o los miembros superiores, el período de incubación será más breve, porque el virus alcanzará la región predilecta con mayor rapidez (llega al sistema nervioso central principalmente a través de los troncos nerviosos, propagándose a lo largo de los nervios sensoriales). Las células que lo acogen son destruidas.<br>  <br>  A partir de ahí el virus emigra hacia los tejidos, pero sobre todo hacia las glándulas salivales, de donde es excretado juntamente con la saliva. El periodo de incubación es muy variable.Si el mordisco del animal rabioso fue efectuado a través de la ropa de la víctima, solamente una peque?a cantidad de saliva contaminada llegará hasta la herida, y esta puede retardar el proceso de la afección.<br>  <br>  Pero, tanto en el hombre como en los animales, cuando los síntomas del mal se manifiestan, ya no hay cura posible: la muerte es inevitables. Así, todo el tratamiento debe ser hecho durante la incubación, cuando el paciente aún no presenta síntomas y no manifiesta quejas.<br>  <br>  En el hombre, el primer síntoma es fiebre poca intensa (380C) acompa?ada de dolor de cabeza y depresión nerviosa.- Enseguida, la temperatura se eleva, llegando a los 40 / 42 grados. Luego, la víctima comienza a mostrarse inquieta y agitada, sufre espasmos dolorosos en la laringe y comienza a respirar y a tragar con dificultad. Los espasmos se extiendes después a los músculos del tronco y de las extremidades, en forma intermitente y acompa?ados por temblores generalizados, taquicardia y detención de la respiración. Cualquier tipo de excitación puede provocarlos (luminosa, sonora, aérea, etc.). <br>  <br>  El hombre, a la inversa del perro, se torna hidrófobo (sufre espasmos violentos cuando ve o trata de beber agua). Frecuentemente experimenta ataques de terror y de depresión nerviosa, presentando tendencia a la vociferación, los alaridos y la agresividad, con accesos de furia, alucinaciones visuales y auditivas, babas y delirio. Ese período de extrema excitación dura cerca de tres días, y enseguida le sigue la etapa de parálisis, más rápida y menos común en los hombres que en los animales.<br>  <br>  Es entonces cuando se observa parálisis fláccida del rostro, de la lengua, de los músculos de la deglución, de los oculares, y de las extremidades de los miembros. Más tarde, la perturbación puede extenderse a todo el cuerno. A veces, la enfermedad puede manifestar una evolución diferente: surge como parálisis progresiva de las extremidades y luego se generaliza. Pero sea cual fuere el tipo. la rabia siempre presenta una evolución inexorablemente fatal para el paciente.<br>  <br>  Período de Incubación<br>  <br>  <br>  Por lo general es de 2 a 8 semanas y a veces puede ser de solo 5 días o durar un a?o o más. Depende de la magnitud de la heridad, el sitio de la laceración en relación con la cantidad de nervios y la distancia del cerebro, la cantidad de virus introducidos, la protección conferidad por la ropa y otros factores.<br>  <br>  Período de Transmisibilidad<br>  <br>  En los perros y gatos de 3 a 10 días antes de que comiencen los signos clínicos y durante todo el curso de la enfermedad.<br>  <br>  Susceptibilidad y resistencia <br>  <br>  Todos los mamíferos de sangre caliente son susceptibles. No se sabe que exista inmunidad natural en el hombre.<br>  <br>  Datos epidemiológicos actuales<br>  <br>  El mayor riesgo de contraer rabia se encuentra en áfrica, Asia y Latinoamérica, ya sea por animales salvajes (zorros, gatos, mangostas, murciélagos, monos, chacales, lobos, etc.), o con mayor frecuencia por perros vagabundos. <br>  <br>  El continente asiático tiene la mayor cantidad de casos de rabia en seres humanos, ya que representa más del 95% de todos los casos mundiales, y unas 35.000 muertes por a?o. <br>  <br>  En 1983, la OMS informó que la rabia causaba 50.000 muertes anuales en países donde la enfermedad es endémica, en particular Asia y el subcontinente indio. <br>  <br>  Si bien afecta a todas las edades, la rabia se observa con mayor frecuencia en ni?os menores de 15 a?os, con unos 40 casos producidos en ni?os de entre 5 y 14 a?os de edad. <br>  <br>  El último caso de rabia humana contraída en Francia se informó en 1924. Sin embargo, entre 1970 y 1996, se registraron 17 casos de rabia en Francia provocados por contaminación en el extranjero (en el sub-Sahara africano, áfrica del Norte, Madagascar y México). En Francia, la rabia es una enfermedad importada.   <br>  <br>  Estrategias de inmunización<br>  Recomendada anteriormente sólo a individuos que tuvieran un riesgo profesional (médicos veterinarios, personal de laboratorios especializados, matarifes, taxidermistas, y guardabosques), la vacunación antirrábica se recomienda actualmente a los viajeros, incluyendo ni?os mayores de 12 meses, que estén planificando un viaje prolongado a una zona endémica.  <br>  <br>  Además, la vacuna antirrábica se administra a las personas que hayan estado en contacto con un animal que pueda tener rabia. Esta vacuna, que requiere cinco inyecciones, es el equivalente al "tratamiento posterior a la exposición". Según la gravedad de la mordedura, en ocasiones se la combina con una dosis de inmunoglobulinas rábicas. Hasta la fecha, representa el único tratamiento efectivo para la rabia. La vacuna neutraliza el virus antes de que pueda alcanzar el cerebro; una vez que el virus infectó el cerebro, el resultado de la enfermedad es siempre fatal. El objetivo de esta inmunización es derrotar con rapidez al virus durante el período de incubación de la enfermedad.  <br>  <br>  Vacunas disponibles<br>  <br>  Actualmente, las vacunas se preparan en base a cultivos celulares. Existen varios tipos de vacuna disponibles, que varían de país en país. Se utilizan varios substratos, incluyendo células diploides humanas (HDCV, vacuna de células diploides humanas), un linaje de células de ri?ón de mono (Vero), células de embrión de pollo, o células fetales de mono rhesus.  <br>  <br>  Historia de la vacunación <br>  <br>  En 1804, Zinke en Alemania condujo la primera transmisión experimental de rabia por inoculación con saliva. En 1879, en Lyon, Victor Galtier transmitió con éxito la rabia de perro a conejo y de conejo a perro. <br>  <br>  En 1881, Roux, Chamberland y Thuillier, miembros del equipo de Louis Pasteur, demostraron que el sistema nervioso central es el sitio primario de reproducción del virus de la rabia. Estos investigadores transmitieron la rabia mediante la inoculación submeníngea de conejos. <br>  <br>  Roux notó que la virulencia del virus en fragmentos de la médula espinal infectada por el virus declinaba con rapidez una vez disecada, y desaparecía por completo luego de un período de 15 días. Pasteur logró proteger a 50 perros que habían recibido una inyección del virus virulento luego de serles administrada una inmunización de protocolo en base a inyecciones subcutáneas repetidas de suspensiones de médula espinal. La inyección inicial contenía extractos desecados no virulentos, y era seguida por inyecciones de fragmentos desecados en períodos más cortos. <br>  <br>  Pasteur administró la vacuna por primera vez el 6 de julio de 1885 al joven Joseph Meister, que había sido mordido 14 veces por un perro unas 60 horas antes. La vacuna, administrada por vía subcutánea, consistía de extractos de médula espinal de conejos conservada en un frasco abierto durante 15 días.

5c8Qmdxeaa	Losing weight is a simple equation: if you burn more calories than you eat, the weight will come off. Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the daily calorie needs calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.<br>  <br>  Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a><br>  <br>  if you have time also read this aah...just forget about what all say...like " go on diet...." "eat less food" bla bla bla!!! just try out the world's best solution that is Eat more,lose more!!!<br>  <br>  haha i am not joking..try this out!!<br>  <br>  9 WAYS TO REDUCE WEIGHT WITHOUT EATING LESS<br>  <br>  ( ! ) Don't starve yourself.<br>  <br>  Lowering your calorie intake will make your body reduce the rate at which it changes calories into energy. In other words, reducing calorie intake slows down your metabolism and holds onto your fat. Starving yourself will actually make it harder for you to lose weight. Food is fuel or energy and when you skip meals, you are not working on energy hat can be burned off. As a defense mechanism, your body clings to calories and slows down your weight loss.<br>  <br>  (2) Get a breakfast boost.<br>  <br>  Connie Dickman, a registered dietician and nutritionist advises not to skip breakfast. According to her, breakfast gives you energy so that you are not starving as the day go on. When you skip breakfast, you become so hungry that you eat more than you should or eat the wrong foods.<br>  <br>  (3) Eat complex carbohydrates.<br>  <br>  Practice eating complex carbohydrates rather than simple carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates are found in food such as candy, cereal, softdrinks and ice cream. They are easily absorbed by the body and they stick to the ribs, according to weight loss specialist Dr. Daisy Merey. Simple carbohydrates have a tendency to make you store more fat.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, complex carbohydrates which are found in pastas, potatoes, beans, whole grains, vegetables and fruits contain "good" calories that are easily burned.. In switching from a meat-based diet to the one tat is starch-based, you get the same amount of food with only 25% of the calories, says John McDougall, M.D., Director of the McDougall Program at St. Helena Hospital.<br>  <br>  Eat more fruits and vegetables, which are high in complex carbohydrates. You will eat more, but you will lose more, because the feeling of fullness will hinder you from eating high-fat foods that make you gain weight.<br>  <br>  <br>  (4) Eat Fiber.<br>  <br>  Kristine Clark, the Director of Sports Nutrition at Penn State University says that eating high-fiber foods can help people keep their weight under control. Because foods hat are rich in fiber help people to slow down their eating and foods that are high in fiber contain less fat and sugar.<br>  <br>  According to Nutrition experts, one should eat 20 to 35 grams of dietary fiber a day. There are two kinds of fiber in foods. The soluble and the insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers are those that dissolve and thicken in water. Foods that contain soluble fibers include broccoli, zucchini, barley, oat bran, beans and citrus fruits.<br>  <br>  Insoluble fibers include skins of fruits and vegetables and the external coatings of wheat kernel.<br>  <br>  Fiber is an essential ingredient in one's diet because the insoluble form prevents constipation. Studies revealed that the soluble fibers play an important role in reducing cholesterol.<br>  <br>  (5) Drink water.<br>  <br>  Water helps the body break down fat and process waste according to Dr. Denise Bruner, a Virginia bariatrician, describing how water as part of her diet, helped her to shed 62 pounds. One should drink eight eight-ounce glasses of water a day.<br>  <br>  (6) Exercise and be active in household work.<br>  <br>  T o exercise is one of the best ways to maintain your weight down. Exercise helps you to burn calories. According to Franca Alphin, Nutrition Director at Duke University Diet and Fitness Center in North Carolina, "You can lose weight without exercising, but you won't maintain the weight loss." Exercise may not be a major player in weight loss, but it is the number one player in preventing weight gain," says Jack H. Gilmore, Ph. D.<br>  <br>  Inactivity burns fewer calories each day, which are stored as fat. Daniel Kosich, Ph. D., the author of Get Real: A Personal Guide to Real-Life Weight Management and an advisor to Jane Fonda Workouts, says regular activity is a critical part of successful weight loss. It doesn't have to be a strenuous workout. You can burn calories just by doing ordinary chores such as gardening and housework. "Pushing a mop or vacuum across the floor increases your heart rate and creates resistance ," says Barbara Baldwin, Information Services Director for the American Running and Fitness Association in Maryland.<br>  <br>  "Raking leaves, stroveling snow, sanding, painting and waxing the car are calorie burners."<br>  <br>  According to Laura Gladwin, California-based exercise physiologist, gardening is a great exercise because weeding, pruning and planting require bending and stretching. "You will burn 1,000 calories by doing three-and-a-half hours of garden or yard work in a week," she says.<br>  <br>  Ellen F., a crafter in Coral Springs, Fl, found out that dieting wasn't enough to help her shed 20 pounds of excess weight.. She joined a low-impact aerobics class at her community center. By doing aerobics excercises for an hour, three times a week, she lost 20 pounds much quicker than simply dieting.<br>  <br>  Walking is one of the healthiest, easiest and cheapest form of exercise. Stroll briskly through a park or around your neighborhood. Walking will be more pleasurable if you do it with a friend..<br>  <br>  Suzanne Rossa, an exercise physiologist at Good Samaritan Health and Wellness Center in West Palm Beach Florida says, "Aerobics excercises improves your circulation , increases blood flow,allow you to have a better blood pressure and decreases the amount of fatty substances in your bloodstream."<br>  <br>  (7) Build muscle.<br>  <br>  Tufts University studies revealed that strength training - the kind that builds muscle will raise your metabolic rate, which enable you to burn calories. Strength training does not always follow that your muscles will grow bigger but they will certainly grow stronger.<br>  <br>  Daniel Kosich in his book, A Personal Guide to Real Life Weight Management says, "when you make muscles stronger, they burn more calories. That means that for each pound of muscle you build with strength excercises, you burn 20 to 30 calories a day from your resting energy output or about 7,300 calories a year. You can strength train by using machines and free weights such as barbells.<br>  <br>  (8) Follow the Pyramid.<br>  <br>  The American Diatetic Association recommends a food guide pyramid that serves as a general list of healthful foods that must be eaten daily. The pyramid has four levels. The top of the pyramid is the smallest part , represents fats, oils and sweets. This group includes salad dressings, butter, ice cream, softdrinks, candies and desserts and foods that has very little nutritional value and can make your calories add up to.<br>  <br>  At level two of the pyramid are the milk, yogurt, cheese group, meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs and nuts. These foods provide you with protein, calcium, iron and zinc.. ADA recommends two to three servings daily of this group.<br>  <br>  The third level represents the vegetable and fruit groups, which are good sources of vitamins, minerals and fiber. ADA recommends three to five servings daily of this group.<br>  <br>  At the base of the pyramid are the bread, cereal, rice and pasta. ADA recommends 6 to 11 servings of this group. These foods are source of fiber, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals<br>  <br>  (9) Stop taking the following food.<br>  <br>  ALCOHOL : a 12-ounce can or bottle of beer contains 150 calories. An<br>  <br>  Alcoholic beverage can add 100 to 200 calories to your meal.<br>  <br>  Alcohol is stored in the liver as fat.<br>  <br>  COCONUT : An ounce of raw coconut contains 100 calories, around 77%<br>  <br>  Of which is saturated fat.<br>  <br>  CHOCOLATE, CANDY, COOKIES :<br>  <br>  They are full of simple carbohydrates, which means they are<br>  <br>  High in sugar and fats. The main fat in chocolate is cocoa<br>  <br>  butter which is approximately 60% saturated fat.<br>  <br>  WHOLE MILK : SWITCH TO SKIM MILK<br>  <br>  Whole milk has high content of fat.<br>  <br>  SUGAR : Softdrinks has very high sugar content.<br>  <br>  MARGARINES : Contain hydrogenated vegetable oils.<br>  <br>  <br>  This article is an excerpt from the book : EAT MORE, LOSE MORE.|`|99c4bdb96fbbce2446cc584a907512caaa	the diets used on The Biggest Loser by the trainer who guided 2 winners to victory on the hit TV show!|`|ZOniVzPWaa	OK.  I've had 4 kids so I know this is possible.  What finally worked for me was changing what I was thinking.  Like changing YUK exercise....to yeah, I want to move more.  And changing my sugar cravings to everything tasting sickenly sweet, and finally getting very full (like a thanksgiving type of full) on half portions at every meal.  I used to use pills and count calories.  But with kids, it's hard to do.  What worked were downloads from Independent Achievement Productions.  And now I don't crave what my kids eat, and I don't clean their plates like I used to either!|`|ehyr7utHaa	You're not going to here much beyond the usual diet and exercise.  <br>  <br>  Don't do a fad diet, because you'll gain the weight back just as fast as you lose it.  Have a well-balanced diet with minimal meat and plenty of fiber.  Be sure and splurge on the weekends to keep your metabolism up.<br>  <br>  Find an easy exercise you can do while watching TV or reading so you're more likely to do it.  I t can be as simple as jumping jacks.  Do it 30 minutes a day a few times a week.<br>  <br>  To make it go faster, you might want to try a natural diet pill.  Different ones work in different ways, so be sure to get one that fits your lifestyle and method of dieting/exercise.  And make sure they are safe to use.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend a fat binder, as they have good results without needing to change diet that much.

DnF4WJLiaa	If you observe your horse lacking stamina and evidencing hooves, hair and skin of substandard quality, you might actually be facing a horse that is not taking in enough protein. On the other hand, if the horse is slimmer than would be healthy, looks good but does not have as much endurance as you think it should, and additionally urinates too often, you are probably looking at a horse that is taking in too much protein but not enough energy. <br>  <br>  Obviously, there is no such thing as a perfect diet. Not even on paper is this feat accomplished, much less in the reality of the stable. The foregoing not withstanding, it is critical that you strive to provide your animal with a diet as balanced as you can possible achieve it. Thus, if you are uncertain whether or not your animal ingests enough protein, it is advisable to err on the side of caution and supply more protein. The same cannot be said for energy. Obviously, you do not want to consciously over-feed protein either, especially when your horse shows no signs of suffering from a protein deficiency. <br>  <br>  For example, horse owners should think twice before feeding only alfalfa hay as the sole source of forage. While this is standard practice in some circles, the percentage of protein to energy is too high, even though the horse may look great, it will perform less than adequate. If you are not certain whether or not your feed is sufficient with respect to nutritional performance, consider that an overall adequate intake will contain of forage that may offer seven to 14 percent of protein and a feed with amino acids supplemented. You will want to ensure that you choose a feed that is specially formulated for the stage of life your horse is in. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|wmS4Hw4baa	I can answer your question, but it would be better if you put this in horses.<br>  <br>  When a horse doesn't have enough protein, all of its strength will go away.|`|G60AGduEaa	It dies? lol
13ENKsmaaa	Chances are you will not feel sane after going off anti psychotics cold turkey. I imagine that they were prescribed for you as treatment of an illness. The symptoms of your illness may return full force and not go away because they were being controlled by the medications. You may continue to be uncomfortable and that is something you have to consider.<br>  <br>  I understand that you want to be off them so you can get pregnant. However, I urge you to talk to your doctor and inform him/her of your decision to become pregnant and find out what he/she thinks. Also work out a plan to slowly taper off the medication. If that is what you are determined to do.<br>  <br>  There are some medications that can be taken during certain terms of pregnancy. Find out the risks from your doctor and discuss alternatives to medication to control your symptoms.<br>  <br>  The stress and hormonal changes from pregnancy could actually cause a "psychotic episode". Keep that in mind and have a plan of action should that happen.<br>  <br>  Stopping any medications without doctor supervision can be dangerous and even deadly.<br>  <br>  Although I was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds, I didn't talk to my doctor and tapered off them by myself when I was going through fertility treatments and artificial insemination. My fertility doctor believed in taking nothing other than Tylenol.<br>  <br>  I didn't get pregnant unfortunately and actually ended up in the psychiatric ward on suicide watch because of being off of my medications so long. When my doctor found out that I had gone off my meds, he said that there were alternative medications that I could have taken during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor and let him/ her know and see what if any alternatives are available to you. Or at the very least, get supervision in tapering off the medications and not quitting cold turkey.<br>  <br>  As someone answered above, your illness may well be passed onto your child. Also, once you have had the baby, it may be more difficult to treat your mental illness with the medications you were on before pregnancy due to hormonal changes and other factors.<br>  <br>  I have a link below that talks about tapering off medications and making an action plan and has some great information and resources. You may want to take a look at it.<br>  <br>  Please at the very least, talk to your doctor and get supervision and advice for tapering off the medications.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dTAQYe2daa	Hopefully you are quitting under the advise of the doctor who prescribed them for you.|`|TGRUUWiwaa	Which anti-psychotic\s?, what dose? how long you been on them, what happened last time, what did you presciber and pharmacist say?

Have you thought all this through, it sounds like you arent currently pregnant.  Also what are you taking and why.  Also you will not feel sane after stopping your meds, that will probably make your symptoms return and a lot of the time when you stop meds it makes the symptoms return two-fold, and also when you go to take meds again they will most likely not be as effective as the first time you were on them.  think this all through.|`|832sXgbDaa	Never quit your anti-psychotic medication cold turkey!  Be sure to consult your physician if you are deciding to stop your medication.  Likewise, be sure to consult your physician regarding your planned pregnancy.

It becomes an addiction where you may do it more and more and one day find out that it doesn't work anymore and the problem,emotion,situation, whatever you are doing this for is still there.  We sometimes determine toughness by how much pain we can tolerate but pain comes and goes and heals over time (most the time).  Usually something like this is a sign of some sort of trauma and is something that you are going to have to face sometime in your life.  You will wake up one day and find that you wasted your whole life away because you put a limit on your self when you do this.  Sometimes it can turn into other things like abuse or drug use.  My advice to you is to find something that isn't harmful and challenges yourself to your potential.  Accomplishment is the best feeling that you have and counters the bad things in our life.  Me I do astronomy or I'll go shooting or find away to make something to go faster or work better like my computer.  They keep my mind off of things and they are things that I enjoy and don't get bored with.  If I'm frustrated I do boxing or go hit a punching bag or an hour.  You have a right to feel anyway you want but how you react is what carries consequences.  Whether you know it or not you transfer things like this to  and not let other people around you and its not there fault.  if it comes to a point where you see no way out then I suggest getting professional help from a Someone who specializes in these things.  We all have inner demons and things in our past that seem to haunt us but you can never change what has happened or lie to change your perception.   But how you deal with things determine who you are and what kinda of person you are.

UeKCTfNZaa	Well I hate to tell ya, but your gonna have to loose some weight to get rid of a jelly belly.<br>  <br>  Well, I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that you can lose your tummy flab and become more toned. The bad news is that, in order to do this, you must reduce the amount of fat you have all over your body, not just in your stomach. You see, spot reduction, or the ability to lose fat in one specific area, is a myth. However, you can help tone specific regions through exercise.<br>  <br>  If you want flat abs, you have to work your whole body as well as your abs muscles during strength training and cardiovascular exercise. If you want to lose weight, you should speak to a nutritionist about how to cut back your calories and fat intake and still eat healthily.<br>  <br>  The second point of the weight loss equation that comes as a surprise to most people is that you can't actually lose fat, you can only reduce the size of your fat cells. This can be done through dieting and regular exercise, but to get the very muscly, six-pack look that many celebs and models have, you'd have to follow a strict diet with very few carbohydrates, which is not what most nutritionists advocate. You need carbs, in fact, to sustain energy.<br>  <br>  As far as working out, you don't need to work your abs more than every other day. You actually work them unconsciously all the time, while sitting, standing and walking. You also work your abs when you're doing press ups and most other upper body moves.<br>  <br>  A realistic exercise programme includes three 30-minute cardiovascular workouts a week. Check with your doctor before beginning a new routine, and if you can't start off doing 30 minutes, just go slowly and build up to this over time. You should incorporate at least two days of strength training into your week and always do ab moves at the end of your strength work. This is so you don't tire out your abs, as they support your back and help prevent injury during the rest of your routine.<br>  <br>  Here are some moves that, when practised with other exercise and a healthy diet, can help you tone up your tummy:<br>  <br>  (recommended, if possible)<br>  <br>     1. The hover: Start on all fours with your hands directly under your shoulders. In a slow motion, come up off your knees onto your toes and lean forward so that all your weight is in your hands and arms. Your arms should be slightly bent. Try not to arch your back or drop your bum. The idea is to keep your body in a straight line. If this is too challenging, drop back onto your knees, but keep your weight forward and in your hands, so you still use your abs to hold yourself off the ground. Hold for up to 20 seconds.|`|Boc1Buuwaa	I love jelly bellys. The buttered popcorns are the best. If you want to get rid of it, just eat it.

In the begining you do lose, when your body starts to build muscle you go up a little. After this if you keep it up, you will start to lose again, but at a slower rate. Switching up your exercises really helps, i see you already do that, so just keep it up. <br>  <br>  Also, make sure you start out your morning with a protein rich breakfast. This will help your body's metabolism stay high all day, eat alot or fruit/veggies also.

Don't weigh yourself. The scale doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is how your clothes fit. If you are not at your ideal size then knock off the weight training. Focus on the cardio. No stepper, no stair climber, no free weights. Just swimming, biking, aerobics, treadmill, elliptical,,,, that stuff. If you want do one set per muscle 2 times per week on weight machines.|`|tTFzxIXgaa	muscle weighs more than fat. when you work out you force your body to use the fat stores as fuel, which effectively makes you lose some pounds. at the same time, you are building up your muscles which adds pounds back on because muscle weighs more than fat. don't go by the scales, i know it's hard but it's better to do measurements. measure your waist and your hips and you'll see the change you want :)

In the privacy of your room, in front of the mirror, take a look at your entire waist and notice the areas  covered by more fat than you need. Take some measurements and keep them taped to your mirror. Next, you must become very serious about all those bags of chips and crunchy chocolate bars, which you are probably putting into your gut everyday. Keep your mind on your goal and think of all the money you will save not buying those items. <br>  Food portions at home should be moderate--no seconds--and after running around in the sports fields come home and learn how to use the blender by making yourself some fruit, skim milk and peanut butter protein shakes--drink only one glass after the sports and have dinner two hours later. This way you will have at least four meals a day, but no more than five for the total day.<br>  There are more technical aspects of diet and exercises, but this is a good basic approach for some one your age without making it complicated to follow.<br>  Let me know how it works for you.|`|UuRiBmbAaa	It is proven that women have a harder time acquiring a six pack then men, but that doesn't mean it is impossible to get one.

Regarding confusing your body, it is not positive in that your body clock? should be able to wake you at the required time. An alarm clock should only be a precaution just in case your body clock fails to do its job for you that could mean you are trying to wake up when your sleep cycles between rem and nrem sleep are not yet ready to deliver wakefulness when your alarm goes off, and the snooze button will not address the deficiency. So perhaps your problem is you are not getting enough sleep.

z5JkgFOyaa	Glands inside your vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.<br>  <br>  The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when a woman is breastfeeding or when a woman is sexually excited.<br>  <br>  Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem.  Some other types of infections such as yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis can also cause discharge that is usually accompanied by odor such as beer/yeast/fish.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if you have any of these signs or any concerns regarding this you consult with your doctor for a proper diagnosis and for proper treatment should you have anything other than just a normal vaginal discharge.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|AA12131791	Its perfectly normal... every women get discharge.  only when it changes colour, texture or smells should you be worried|`|ev6KGdENaa	yep, quite normal, all (well most) women get that. :)<br>  <br>  help me please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoZTPedUqF.B_UqGbRU1xuDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080619221830AAAXfg1">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ieHp1eXnaa	its normal..its a way that the inside of the vagina is cleaned..|`|bafad1e58b0b4deca23abb56dba12260aa	totally normal...thats the way the body cleanse itself before the red river comes

oThixZeBaa	Here's where I suggest going for a full (and free!) plan: www.sparkpeople.com<br>  <br>  They'll give you an eating and work-out plan as well as tools to track how well you're doing.<br>  <br>  Just a couple tips:<br>  Drop the soda habit. Caffeine dehydrates you (it's like negative water!), the carbonation eats away at your bones and teeth (it's worse for your teeth than sugar), and aspartame (the artificial sweetener in diet) turns into formaldehyde in your body and is banned in other countries. No joke. <br>  Eat if you're hungry, but make better choices. Try vegetables. As you get older, they get yummier.<br>  Cut down on sugar. Here's what happened to me: I radically cut down on my sugar for a while, then binged on it. I couldn't believe the light-headed high and horrible crash sugar gave me. And not only that, but it ages you. Sucks, right?<br>  Figure out something active to do that you like.

The body normally burns a mix of carbohydrate, as glucose, and fat for fuel. How much of either depends on your physical activity and if, or what you have eaten recently. When you use more energy than you take in from food and drink, the body burns stored fat and carbohydrates, and then even protein, to fuel your everyday activities even if you are not exercising<br>  <br>  That’s what happens when people starve of course; the body starts to eat itself. Depending on your family history -- your genetics -- and the way you eat and exercise to create this energy deficit, your body may decide to get conservative and drop your metabolic rate to try to hold onto body weight. Some of us seem to have inherited this tendency more than others, the origins of which may be in the early periods of human evolution where 'feast or famine' was more or less the norm.<br>  <br>  Glucose, fat and protein. Even so, starvation always works eventually and the body starts to break down its own tissue for fuel. Stored carbohydrate called glycogen is quickly used up, then goes the fat stored under the skin and around the internal organs. Protein in muscle is then broken down to create glucose to keep the brain working and you conscious. <br>  <br>  Fat and glucose are the body’s two main energy sources. Fat you know well, glucose comes mainly from carbohydrate foods like rice and bread and potatoes and protein is supplied mainly by meat and beans and dairy products. The amino acid building blocks of protein foods can be converted to glucose in emergencies. Your body always burns a mix of fat and glucose except at very high intensities, and the ratio of the fat and glucose in 'the burn' varies with intensity and time of exercise.<br>  <br>  Fat burning zone. You may have noticed that some bikes and treadmills at the gym have a setting that says “fat burning zone”, which implies a setting for intensity or speed. The reason for this is that the body burns a greater percentage of fat at a slow pace (or after about 90 minutes of exercise). The fat burning zone, a low intensity speed zone is mainly a gimmick, and here is the reason.<br>  <br>  Even though you burn more fat going slowly, you still burn a percentage of fat at much faster speeds or intensity. It all boils down to how much energy you expend in totality. For example, if you compare exercising at a slow rate that burns 60 percent fat and 40 percent glucose and a higher intensity or duration that burns only 30 percent fat and 70 percent glucose, you may still burn more fat at the higher intensity. <br>  <br>  A typical example. Exercise (1) is the slower 60/40 mix and exercise (2) is the faster, 30/70 mix of fat and glucose fuel.<br>  <br>  Walking on a treadmill for 30 minutes -- 180 calories used -- 108 calories of fat burned <br>  Running on a treadmill for 30 minutes -- 400 calories used -- 120 calories of fat burned<br>  You can see from this example that the bottom line really is how much energy you expend -- and that is the ultimate fat burning measure. The theoretical fat burning zone is mostly a convenient myth.<br>  <br>  Weight Training Does it Better -- Or Does It?<br>  Muscle burns more fat. Weight training is increasingly recommended as a fat-busting tool because some experts say extra muscle burns more energy than body fat at rest, so if you develop more muscle and have a higher muscle to fat ratio than before, you must burn extra energy and more stored fat as a result. This is true and has been shown in metabolic studies. However, the differences are not that dramatic; perhaps less than a few tens of calories per day for each pound of muscle increased, for most people.<br>  <br>  Does that mean you shouldn’t worry about weight training? Certainly not, because weight training has many other benefits for health and performance, not the least of which is extra muscle. It’s just that this advantage has been somewhat overstated and we need to get this fat burning thing right in order to develop the best weight loss and performance programs.<br>  <br>  Getting the afterburn. Okay, so extra muscle does not provide that much advantage, but what about the afterburn? The 'afterburn', or the amount of energy you use after you stop exercising, has been promoted as an important slimming idea. If you can get afterburn, which is really another way of saying your metabolism increases for several hours or longer after a particular exercise, then that’s a bonus because you burn fat during the exercise and after you cease as well. Will the fun ever stop! <br>  <br>  However, this idea has recently been reconsidered as well. An article in the Journal of Sports Science in December last year reported that despite some promising early studies of this effect, the idea has not proven to be as useful as first thought. <br>  <br>  Exercise scientists call this afterburn effect EPOC, which stands for Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption. The authors of that study say that the high intensities required -- greater than about 75 percent of maximum heart rate -- are probably beyond what most people wanting to lose weight can cope with in sustained exercise. So the afterburn advantage from lifting weights or running fast is there, but you need to be able to sustain that intensity, which means a lot of hard work. No secrets there, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Strength training has so many great things going for it that I'm a big fan -- increased strength, more muscle and body shape, better balance and bone density and improved functionality across all facets of human movement. But let’s be honest, we all need aerobic or cardio training as well. It has its own set of important functional benefits including general fitness, elastic arteries, increased heart and lung function and lower blood pressure to name a few benefits.<br>  <br>  Lifting weights can easily move us into the high intensity exercise zone above the 75 percent effort required to get some afterburn, but it's only for short bursts. This is not consistent, steady-state effort and does not generally burn as much energy as a good run on the treadmill, cycle or row machine at moderate pace. For example, here are the energy expenditure calculations for weights versus cardio for one hour of exercise from the NAT Nutritional Analysis Tools web site. I've based this on a 150 pound person (just under 70 kilograms).<br>  <br>  Running at 8 minutes a mile pace (5 min/km) -- burn 852 calories (kilocalories) <br>  Weight lifting, vigorous, free weights or machines -- burn 409 calories (kilocalories)<br>  I’ve tried to line these activities up for effort so that the comparison is worthwhile. Whenever I check these numbers it astounds me because I run and I lift weights, and sometimes I feel much fresher after a run than going for it in the gym with sub-10 RM (repetition maximum) and three sets of ten exercises. Nevertheless, the numbers always come out the same with any reputable energy calculator. Sustained aerobics always spends about twice the energy of weight training in a comparable comparison. You can see from this why cardio sessions are important for fat loss.<br>  <br>  Should I Exercise Before Breakfast to Burn More Fat?<br>  The answer is 'not necessarily', because even though you will burn more fat on an empty stomach, ultimately this will probably make little difference because your energy intake and expenditure and metabolism balances out, more or less, over the 24-hour period. What really matters is your total energy intake and expenditure, that is, how much you eat and how much you exercise and move in general. <br>  <br>  However, stay tuned on this because until this is examined further scientifically, how much meal timing manipulation could help with fat loss is not certain. One thing that seems clear is that people who eat breakfast maintain weight better and lose fat quicker, so don’t skip breakfast.<br>  <br>  The Best Strategy for Fat Loss<br>  So where are we at with our fat burning project? Here is a summary.<br>  <br>  Increase muscle with weight training. Extra muscle helps to burn more energy at rest, even if only a little. This is called the resting metabolic rate of muscle or RMR. Extra muscle will also burn more fat in active phase, the active metabolic rate if you like, or the AMR, so having more muscle will definitely help burn more energy and fat. <br>  <br>  Lift heavier weights. What I suggest is that the weights workout should be vigorous, with the number of repetitions kept at the low to medium end of the scale between 8 and 12 RM. To remind you, the RM is the repetition maximum, which means the most weight you can lift for this number of reps before fatigue. The 8-12 is within a range that should provide strength and bigger muscle growth, which is called hypertrophy.<br>  <br>  If you go higher than this, say 15 to 20 repetitions to a set, or more, you are getting into the range where you would probably be better off doing cardio because the return on effort, the energy burn, is better spent jogging, cycling, stepping or rowing. At that number of repetitions you won’t build much muscle either, so very high-repetition training with weights has minimum value in my view.<br>  <br>  Do aerobic exercise. Considering how much energy you would use in an hour of either type of exercise, weights or cardio, you must do some consistent aerobic or cardio work to burn fat.<br>  <br>  Try high-intensity cardio. Remember the study from the University of New South Wales that we started with? High-intensity exercise, even if only in short bursts, may rev up the metabolism and get that fat mobilized. Do some high intensity as well, but don’t overdo it, because burning the fat is a long-term project and you don’t want to get ‘burned out’. A group exercise program such as a solid cycle spin class might match this requirement. In fact, I highly recommend group cycle spin classes where you are encouraged to go fast, yet with the option to slow dow

There never used to be salads at fast food places, so things are improving.  By the time you have kids, things will be a lot better.  By the time THEY have kids, things will be better yet. You'll see. Is there some way you can take your lunch and keep it in a fridge somewhere?  If not, make a sandwhich, and if you like mayo, take the packets you get in fast food joints.<br>  Your letter is great.  Especially the part of drinking water in class!  Try to find out who's in charge of nutrition in your school, and send that person exactly what you wrote in your question.  You have so many good ideas.  Someone has to start somewhere!! The best I can do is give you a star!<br>  Bless you and good luck!  :)|`|GLdUaurmaa	I know exactly how you feel. Sometimes I just eat a small lunch at school and then eat healthy foods when I get home. Would it be possible to make your lunch at home and bring it to school? Then you wouldn't have to worry. Or when you go to the salad bar just ask someone to help you reach what you need. I wouldn't put up with people ignoring you. And could you bring water in a purse or backpack to have with you? Even if you couldn't drink it in class at least you wouldn't have to pay for it in the cafe. To make some changes, start with suggesting what you want to see to the food director or other people in charge. Good luck. :)

FicyC2TXaa	.Hereditary breast cancer is rare - only 5-10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary. The rest are random and nothing to do with genetics.<br>  <br>  There are two faulty genes that are known to be responsible for hereditary breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2. If someone carries one of these genes, then each of their children has a 50% chance of inheriting that gene, though inheriting it does not mean they will definitely get breast cancer - that's a 50-80% chance (for females - much lower [1 - 8%] for males). If one of their children inherits the gene, then each of her children will have a 50% chance of inheriting it in their turn.<br>  <br>  If someone has a parent who carries one of the faulty genes, but that someone doesn't inherit it themselves (50-50 chance remember), then there is no possibility of their children inheriting it. It can ONLY be inherited from a parent. A friend of mine carries one of the BRCA genes; both her daughters have been tested for it - one has inherited it, the other hasn't.<br>  <br>  So while it would be possible for breast cancer itself to skip a generation, and no doubt it sometimes happens - grandmother has a faulty gene and gets breast cancer, mother inherits the gene but does not herself develop breast cancer, daughter inherits the gene and develops breast cancer - it isn't a pattern, it isn't something that 'usually' happens. And the faulty genes can't skip a generation<br>  <br>  If your grandmothers' breast cancers were isolated incidents of the disease within their separate families, they were  almost certainly not hereditary. A sign that a cancer (any type) may 'run in a family' is when several members of the same side of the family have had the same type of cancer. <br>  <br>  So the chances are that your grandmothers had non-hereditary breast cancer, and you are at no increased risk. Also, you don't say what age they were, but cancer of all types, including breast cancer, diagnosed after the age of 50 is less likely to be hereditary.<br>  <br>  At least one in nine women get breast cancer, so it's not unusual for two or more women in the same family to have had it, especially among women over 50 (80% of those diagnosed are over 50)<br>  <br>  After I was diagnosed with breast cancer my doctor was able to assure me that my cancer was not hereditary, and that members of my (largely female) family were not at increased risk.|`|c848061b89b79ec53411715c54766887aa	No.  It does not skip a generation.  Yes, it can give you a genetic tendency.  If you're concerned, always do the self exams.  If you're over the age of 40, you need to be having a yearly mammogram.  If you are under the age of 40, you need to be doing the self exams and seeing your gyno on a yearly basis.<br>  <br>  Also, be aware that too much caffeine can cause lumps.  You also need to be aware that the breast is somewhat lumpy anyway.  Some have more than others.  You just need to be watching for the changes in texture in your breasts and any lumps that have changed in size.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!<br>  <br>  While it is rare, please always remember to do the self exams.  You can see your physician, along with your guardian, to learn how to do them properly.  There are a lot of things that are rare in this world, be we still should take the necessary precaution to see that it's prevented.<br>  <br>  It's like walking across the street - you look both ways to prevent being hit by a car.  It's not all that common that people are killed (injured yes, killed no) by cars while crossing the street, but it still happens!  It never hurts to check.<br>  <br>  You are still very young, but it's a good idea to get a monthly self exam started and a yearly physical with your physician.  Once you're in your 20's, you'll want to see a gynocologist on a regular basis.|`|UymhqMQiaa	Only a small percentage, no more than 10%, of breast cancers have a genetic basis. So, its most likely statistically that both of your grandmothers were part of the other 90% than the 10% with a genetic basis.  This is particularly true if no one else in the family has had the problem.<br>  <br>  The genes most commonly associated with breast cancer are the BRCA1, BRCA2 genes. There are tests that can be done to see if you are a carrier but even having the gene does not mean that you will for sure get cancer...it just puts you at higher risk.<br>  <br>  I would talk to your doctor. If the grandmas were the only ones in the family with the history, I would stick with the usual monthly breast exams and then mammography after age 40.  If your doc has additional concerns, they can always do the genetic test but I think the risk is relatively small.|`|lhQamAEEaa	No, it doesn't skip generations.   At only 14 you are worried and developing and scared.  There are many tests available to you and when you go to a dr. next time write down your concerns and ask him all about it and tell him your family history.  Do not be afraid of any testing no matter how many people joke about it etc.  Those tests are life savers.  I ought to know.  It saved my life.  My Mother had breast cancer at 60 and again at 70.  I had breast cancer at 50 and now I am 62 and cancer free.  So the tests are for your benefit and very satisfying to "know" that you do not have cancer.  <br>  Be just worried enough to test if the dr. says it's necessary.  At 14 you can have lumps and bumps in the breast that is nothing but developing milk glands and is completely normal.  I at that age was worried sick that I was going to die from cancer.  No one ever told me that those developing breasts were normal.  Even tho I got cancer at 50 it had nothing to do with what happened at 14.<br>  People on the average who die from cancer didn't get checked often and soon enough.  With a family history, you will be getting checked by your dr. when he says it's time.  Until then, relax, study up if you want to and do some research, give some time to cancer research or just be a young woman  and don't worry so much.|`|AA12056830	absolutely. and if your mother is still alive....how do you know it has skipped generations? not to worry you, but it is important that you are knowledgeable. my grandmother had breast cancer when she was 32. she had a radical mastectomy and it never came back. but she died of lung cancer at 63. my mother got breast cancer at 46 and she just died in August after fighting it for four years. my gynecologist said he's going to start my mammograms at 35.|`|CTcXyNaRaa	Yes.

Try reducing your intake.  Iodine is found in kelp (the highest concentration of iodine known) and iodine-rich foods, such as beef liver, turkey, asparagus, white onions and broccoli.<br>  <br>  <br>  Home Remedies for Sweaty Hands:<br>  <br>  Antiperspirants: It works for your underarms and it will work for your palms! Try this out in private first - you may not like the feel or the smell!<br>  <br>  Astringents: Witch hazel or alcohol wipes help shrink pores and reduce sweating. Try rubbing medical alcohol wipes over your palms moments before you have to greet somebody.<br>  <br>  Sage: A tincture of sage is good for reducing perspiration. To make the tincture, combine 1/2 cup of powdered sage leaves with 1 1/4 cups of vodka or vermouth in a well-sealed bottle; let stand for two weeks, shaking twice daily; strain and store in another bottle. Take 25 drops 3-4 times daily, or as needed. Drink a cup of sage tea daily to reduce perspiration, too.<br>  <br>  Tea bags: Hold a wet tea bag in your palm for 10 to 15 minutes each day. You may need to use this technique for one to three weeks before a major event. The tannin in tea (regular - not herbal) is an astringent and its ability to shrink pores may decrease the perspiration.<br>  <br>  Zinc: Taking zinc tablets has successfully reduced perspiration and body odor. However, don't take more than 15 mg daily for more than a week or two without medical supervision, as zinc may interfere with the absorption of copper, another trace element.<br>  |`|FWRzry6paa	go see your doctor, you may have hyperhidrosis. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hyperhidrosis-sweating-when-should-you-see-doctor" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hyper...</a>|`|WsRdxaXeaa	the same problem of my freind. i think it's psychological rather than physical

Protein is the "bricks" to his house he is trying to build and the Carbs are the "brick layers". <br>  <br>  He can find the most cost effective prices online at places like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpsnutrition.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpsnutrition.net/</a><br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bulknutrition.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bulknutrition.com/</a><br>  <br>  as far as which product to use after his workout:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpsnutrition.net/get_item_un200.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpsnutrition.net/get_item_un2...</a><br>  <br>  congratulations to you for being concerned enough to investigate for him!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|J6O66K7Gaa	Yes, both are safe. They will not stunt his growth or do anything weird to him.<br>  <br>  Protein powder is essentially just powdered milk will all of the lactose and carbs and far removed. My favorite branch is Optimum Nutrition. They have a large selection of flavors and consistent quality. And you can mix it with a spoon - no bender needed. Which is handy.<br>  <br>  Vitamins:  basically he needs a good multi vitamin. There are tons of choices and most are similar enough that it doesn't really matter. I prefer Universal Nutrition's Animal Pak. It might be a bit overkill for your nephew. I workout 5-10 times a week for up to 2 hrs a session. Although that is on the extreme side. Normally its 5 times a week for 90 minutes a session. And the Pak does pretty well for me. If he is really working out intensely and consistently then it doesn't hurt to have a little overkill. Otherwise a cheaper and probably as effective option would be a normal multi. You can get the cheaper store brand at target or walmart and be just fine.

You need to go see a doctor as soon as possible|`|iOGxO821aa	Haha, wow you guys need to chill out. Instead of telling her not to have sex, you need to be telling her how to treat her current issue. The fact is she's had sex, and she's not going to stop having sex because it goes against your own morals, and she didn't rightfully ask for your opinion on whether she should or shouldn't have intercourse. OH, and I don't have an answer to this question. I don't remember a burning sensation ever with me, but I don't think you've got a yeast infection or anything serious. Wait it out a little while, and if it's still a bother, you should look into seeing a gynecologist.|`|oOIaYQERaa	Have mercy on my fragile heart.  Go to a doctor. Use protection.  Pee right after, I mean right after or you might be someone who gets UTI's from sex easily.  Also, it might be a yeast infection.  Go to the doctor (without your mom) and be completely honest with him, tell him you've had sex, he won't tell your mom, so no worries.  and go from there.

Save the one and use that for the flavor.  If you don't like eggs at all then a piece of fruit, slice or two of wheat toast, and a glass of milk will be a very healthy breakfast.  And it will fill you up until you eat again.  You should try to eat 4-6 meals a day.  Don't get overwhelmed by that. I'm not suggesting giant calorie filled meals.  A meal is just something your eating basically. Just look at the side panels that tell you what is in your servings.  And stay away from sugary juices and snacks.  Good Luck!  You'll do fine. Eating healthy consistantly is the key. |`|4JGXPOhaaa	Any kind of fruit would be a great start for breakfast...although just eating breakfast alone could help you stabalize your diet so you don't over eat throughout the day.

Ej5R4ilyaa	We cannot help you in this, but I can tell you to go to the medic and get yourself checked out. Then your worries are over and you get your results.

But go get yourself checked out bud.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You can always get herpes, regardless of condom use.  It generally spread outward around the pubic area while a condom only covers the penis.

It is a good one to get a girl to have an orgasm. <br>  <br>  ~Communicate with her-- asks her what feels good, where does she like to be rubbed and played with. Ask her what turns her on that you do.<br>  <br>  ~Try positions that enable you to get your member to hit her G spot.

Take it slow and communicate talk to each other. That is always the best sex! You two will get so connected and your souls will feel like one if you do that.<br>  <br>  ~It is important for women to be properly stimulated prior to intercourse.

You may want to schedule an appt with a pulmonologist (lung doctor). You may ask him to check your alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) levels. This is a simple blood test. A1AT is a protein made in the liver, however some people do not make enough or make the wrong kind. Low A1AT levels causes the elastin in your lungs to break down. Elastin is what allows the the lungs to inflate and deflate. Emphysema is caused by the inability of the lungs to fully deflate, causing air to be trapped. So I would reccomend talking to your doctor about this. Hope this helps, and good luck!|`|iVCxn2H3aa	Marfan syndrome is a genetically transmitted disease which primarily affects the connective tissue. People with Marfans tend to be tall thin with long arms and legs. They will develop eye problems as the lens attachments are weak, and can develop aortic aneurysms. By and large asthma is not directly related to Marfans, but there is an increased incidence of spontaneous pnemothorax  (lung collapse).|`|UIILEn0Uaa	i have marfan syndrome. they arent linked, (i dont think..)<br>  <br>  marfan affects the heart, and limbs(mostly)<br>  <br>  questions for you:<br>  <br>  are you tall and thin?<br>  <br>  wear glasses?<br>  <br>  get tired easily?<br>  <br>  have long arms/legs?<br>  <br>  scoliosis?<br>  <br>  i
3y2G8wgjaa	Hey, welcome to the Ugly Club!<br>  <br>  Well, as I've been told..AND I believe...LIFE is what you make it.  For some of us, it's not easy, but it takes Effort!  There's lots to look forward to, but it all depends on YOU.  Don't just expect life to give you a bunch of rewards just because you are living.  There needs to be a desire within yourself to make things better.  I am (and have chosen and strive to be) self-entertained.  Don't expect others to entertain you, and eventually others will notice and admire you for it.  Just don't reclessly over do it.<br>  <br>  I hope you aren't a follower who caters to other peoples style or traits to 'Fit IN'.  This is the wrong approach.  Instead, just be yourself.  Always try to see things on the bright side.  Stay focussed on your schoolwork and positive things.  Learn to appreciate what you have and WHO you DO have as friends and family.  Always respect others and be courtious.<br>  <br>  Last, but not least, PRAY!  There IS power in prayer, even if some say it's not so...that doesn't MAKE it not so.  <br>  <br>  Best Wishes, and God Bless!<br>  <br>  |`|rllnRDNmaa	my kitten died today <br>  <br>  i have no freinds <br>  <br>  im abused by my father <br>  <br>  i cut <br>  <br>  i just wrote a sad poem <br>  <br>  AT LEAST YOUR NOT ME!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>    Winter    <br>  <br>  In a winter storm I lie <br>  In a winter storm I die <br>  <br>  Never to see light <br>  Never to see night <br>  <br>  Alone forever<br>  Together never <br>  <br>  One last kiss     <br>  Is simply bliss     <br>  |`|NpdfsTXBaa	i was wondering that myself|`|HAeqgbkCaa	right first of all i know how you feel and if you want to talk about things more please email me... u probably dont want to hear this but you will find someone that likes you the same.. there is always something to look forward to even if it is something small jus try and focus on that|`|IdJjl90vaa	I agree with Troy W.  Took the words right out of my mouth.|`|JzKTmfrHaa	You have much to look forward to. <br>  Don't base your life on your emotions.  Emotions are just perceptions.  Change your perceptions.  Work on becoming a better  you.  Set some goals.. Learn to play a cool instrument.  Join a club, get a cool job, etc.  Learn to me a positive nice guy and you'll meet people left and right.  <br>  There is so much more to life than what you are feeling right now.  So stay encouraged!  You're going to do great... the joys of life are endless.  Think about it, you still get to get married, experience the feeling of raising a child, getting a good job.  the list goes on.  Just stay encouraged and force yourself to smile (it releases endorphines to your brain, causing you to feel good. )|`|9Xusa3ctaa	I know exactly how you feel. I was the outcast in my school from kindergarten to high-school and within my family. The odd ball out, always on the outside looking in. And I never dated. There were times I wanted to end things too. However, I reminded myself that I was still very young. I know people always say things like that but I thought about it logically. Statistically humans can live to around 70 and in high-school your between the ages of 14-18. This means that you have 52-56 years left, if your lucky and in good health. That's a lot of time. Sure, there is going to be some bad times but think of all the good times you would miss out on. You choose how your life goes. You can either wallow in a miserable life or learn from your experiences and do something, no matter how small, to change the world. I want to be an author and write about characters that were similar to me. To give sympathy and a sense of connection to those who have the same problems and to give insight to those who don't. There is always something to look forward to because you can make it possible.|`|Fz0EBh76aa	A couple of years ago while in college I had a suicide attempt and my coworkers made me start seeing psychiatrists. After a second attempt, I said the same things you list to a doctor and she started talking about if I should go to a hospital near school or near home to get treatment. It freaked me out! I didn't want to leave school mid-year, so I just put up with it. <br>  <br>  I think that the media makes us think that our lives have to be a certain way and everything, but you can do whatever you want! I would suggest finishing HS if you are still in, but then you don't have to go to college like everyone else. You can join the military and go on all sorts of adventures (my friend in the Navy parties in Guam and made out with a fire dancer!), or go to Africa and help people, or do whatever you want to do!<br>  <br>  Your life may seem like crap now, but when I was there I loved Bob Dylan's phrase, "When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose." It sounds like you have no strings attached if you don't have family or friends holding you back. <br>  <br>  I would really suggest going to 3rd world countries to help people. When you are suicidal you don't worry about dying, so you can risk your life to help people. It is hard to see your feelings as a benefit, but I am the only person I know who isn't scared of dying, and knowing that takes away almost any other fear I have.<br>  <br>  Feel free to send me a message if you wanna tell me more about yourself.|`|Vh89ONb6aa	I know where you're coming from. I've gone through two episodes where I completely fell head over heels for guys that I've liked and one didn't like me back because I was too ugly for him. Or fat, or whatever. I don't think I'm ugly. At the time it really hurt me but then later on down the road, I'm like, why would I ever want to be with someone who didn't like me for who I am?<br>  <br>  The other guy does like me, but not like that, because he's gay. =P<br>  <br>  Can't really help that one, haha.<br>  <br>  But it still HURTS beyond belief. People who have never experienced this have no idea. The only thing that helps is time. And meeting new people. That's also easier said then done, though.<br>  <br>  Listen to me, things are never going to be perfect. Never ever ever. But they do get better one step at a time. You'll never know if you'll ever experience what you're so desperately craving right now if you don't continue living your life. If you end it, you will feel nothing. You won't be happy. You won't be anything.<br>  <br>  My family also sucks. That's why I'm getting a job and moving out ASAP. You don't have to deal with them forever. I suggest you just ignore them for now.<br>  <br>  Sorry if none of this helped, but I know exactly what you're going through.<br>

Start running a mile everyday.  once you are comfortable running a mile, run a mile and a half.  then run 2 miles.  then 3 miles.  then 3 and a half, then 4 and finally 5.  just push yourself.  you can do it.  drink water, but do not chug water.  right after you run you will be winded and tired and thirsty, but only take sips of cold water.  if you drink too much cold water too fast right after you run your stomach could get upset.|`|Y95TGph4aa	ya man, no big complex running plan needed, just start running.

U should definitely be able to run at least 3 miles already.|`|mrjRPHzTaa	The first thing you need to do right now, is slow down when you run, slow right down.<br>  If you cannot hold a conversation when you run, then your running to fast. That's your first mistake, your trying to sprint 5 miles, your trying to run before you can walk, it ain't gonna happen. <br>  <br>  Start off at a very very slow jog and just jog for about 2 miles until you at least complete the two miles. It doesn't matter that it's slow, it will just get you used to it. Keep doing that for a few weeks, then increase your distance. Eventually your body will let you know you can go faster.<br>  <br>  A lot of running is about breathing. If your breathing wrong, then it will make it twice as hard. Learn to breath correctly when you run. 3 breaths in, 2 out and find a pattern that suits your speed.<br>  <br>  Buy a watch that measures your EKG heart rate and don't go above 160bpm for now, while your learning.<br>  <br>  Sorry i don't want to make this into an essay, but do a little research you will get there.|`|kTZevQNHaa	eat spaghetti and steamed frozen spinach with vinegar on it=good for energy.<br>  you have to build up your endurance by gradually increasing your intervals...so u can do barely a mile...so next time, do a little more...then add  on weekly...takes training and tenacity and time to build up endurance. u don't wanna overdo it or you can hurt yourself.it's fun and good to run with a dedicated running buddy if you have one or wear headphones and run--in the day---not night with headphones because you need your attention...too many bad creeps out htere --u could get mugged at night...run in day with headphones...and get a map and mark the route you wish to do.<br>  you can also go to gym to top up your workouts...on the treadmill.do some stretches before you run to loosen up so u don't get cramps or stitches  or shin splints.|`|ON2SMQAEaa	First, start running as far as you can. don't make yourself sick or try to run it fast, just run. and then try to build up every time you run after that, and push yourself to go further. eat normal healthy foods, it takes different people different lengths of time so don't worry about time.|`|GNe9A12yaa	first run maybe run a half  a miles ( if that is easy, shout and run, it is harder) <br>  run a half mile any day for a week than move out to 1 mile a week<br>  ounce your used to that shout<br>  that 1 and a half|`|5db4d7a2d10b269ebff1b86c6daf799aaa	Attain a good pace at the mile first, give yourself about three weeks for this. To gain speed and endurance, try sprinting every two minutes for 15 seconds. Once comfortable with this, go to sprinting every 1 1/2 minutes for 30 seconds. This will get you trained for a good pace in the mile. And this is the formula is for gaining speed.<br>  <br>  Pace yourself, and do not do the speed formula until you've gotten use to running each increment.<br>  <br>  Go for 1 1/2 miles, do this for two week.<br>  Then do two miles, for two weeks.<br>  do three miles for about one week.<br>  Then four miles for another week.<br>  Then your at five miles.<br>  <br>  Eat carbs, and it should take about 6 - 8 weeks if your serious about this, and if you use formula properly.  Remember this is fast paced, you can stretch it out to cover 4 to 6 months.|`|PwgIJdReaa	I run 3miles when i wake up since it usually wakes me up..<br>  Just go at a steady pace.

People just drink it with their workouts and healthy eating.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	It does have caffine.<br>  <br>  It is a diuretic (makes you go to the bathroom).<br>  <br>  The myth that it promotes weight loss comes from the fact that the Japanese are so slender and drink green tea as part of their normal diet. It's just a myth.<br>  <br>  The fact is that the average Japanese woman walks at least 3 miles during day to day activities. The average Japanese man walks 4 miles a day.<br>  <br>  E.g. <br>  Walk to and around the train station (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to work from the train station (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to lunch (0.25 miles)<br>  Walk back from lunch (0.25 miles)<br>  Walk to and around the train station (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to the gym (0.25 miles)<br>  Walk home from the gym (0.5 miles)<br>  Walk to the train station to meet friends for dinner.... you get the idea.<br>  <br>  Essentially the Japanese population WALKS everywhere and uses public transportation because it costs a small fortune to own a car and the traffic is miserable. (To park it costs $800 a month. The emissions testing is around $1000 and a driver's license costs around $2500 with testing.)<br>  <br>  Boy, those diet pill, wu yen tea people never stop, do they?  None of that stuff works.  Just walk or do low intensity exercise and cut down on your caloric intake.

BCzrcwKFaa	do you maybe need glasses?  maybe your eyes are getting strained on the way to school causing headaches... <br>  other than that, you might be getting dehydrated which can cause brutal headaches - exactly like a hangover!  try keeping hydrated and see if that helps.  <br>  it might also be allergies.  you aren't exposed to them until school, so that's when you get the headache.  you could try a non-drowsy antihistamine before you leave and see if that helps.  there are products that will last all day. <br>  <br>  i hope you start feeling better!  that's so not conducive to trying to learn :)|`|TqsXsaxUaa	You could try bringing something to school to take after you get the headaches.
TODzjTczaa	The answer to your question is very simple, and very complicated.  <br>  <br>  The simple answer is: If a fruit is grown at all, it's grown under conditions that make it viable as a food.  So, for example, the strawberries you buy today (in the 'off season') are grown under conditions that they naturally grow under -- usually in the 'on season' in Chile, for example. So, under the loosest definition, you're OK.  But, there's a lot more to look at.<br>  <br>  First: if you're not buying local produce, you can't be sure what processes are performed on your produce.  It may just be waxed, or it may be sprayed with any number of chemicals, some of which may be toxic.  It may be irradiated, which renders a lot of it's nutritive value unaccessable by your body.  (Incidentally, microwaves do the same thing, so if you're microwaving your food, you're already losing more than half of the nutritive value.)  The FDA has requirements on processes must be labeled (i.e. irradiated meat is required to be labeled as such IF it originates within the USA), but it's impossible for them to actually monitor and control what goes on overseas before the food is shipped.<br>  <br>  Secondly, generally speaking, those farms in Chile and large commercial farms here in the US tend to be overfarmed -- the produce has reduced nutritional value because the "lastest" farming methods are short-term, max-profit-now systems that ruin the nutritive value of the dirt -- so unless it's a brand-new field, your produce is already less valuable than what your local farmers market has to offer.<br>  <br>  The best bet really is to buy local, buy in-season, and buy fresh, whole foods.  It might seem a little limiting at first, but you get used to it fast. Winter squash for the win! :)

HmVhxPSWaa	A hernia is the protrusion of an organ through the wall that normally contains it. An inguinal hernia occurs in the groin area (the area between the abdomen and the thigh), when an organ, usually a part of the intestine, protrudes through the abdominal wall into the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal carries the spermatic cord in men and a round ligament that is attached to the uterus in women.<br>  <br>  Some people, especially men, are born with a weakness in their groin muscles. Ninety percent of the newborns who have inguinal hernias are boys. With or without this weakness, an inguinal hernia can be caused by increasing pressure in the abdomen. Risk factors include:<br>  <br>  * Being moderately to severely overweight<br>  * Pregnancy<br>  * Lifting heavy objects<br>  * Persistent coughing, such as smoker's cough<br>  * Sneezing a lot, which may be common in a person with allergies<br>  * Straining during bowel movement, which may be caused by constipation or diarrhea<br>  * For men, trying to urinate when there is a blockage caused by an enlarged prostate<br>  <br>  ** Check the below links for complete details **

What they do is insert a peg into the bone(usually under general anesthesia) then in about a month after it has healed they have a tooth made to match your others with a matching peg that "snaps" over the peg in your mouth.

E6K7d4bkaa	I don't like meal replacement drinks, as they don't train you long term to stay healthy and keep the weight off. Also, they are expensive.<br>  <br>  Try just eating healthy, and in small portions throughout the day with healthy morning and afternoon snacks such as celery, almonds, dried fruit, fresh fruit, cut veggies or soups (instant miso found in the organic section can be made in a mug at school with just some hot water!)<br>  <br>  by eating healthy you will not only loose weight, but keep it off.<br>  <br>  Drink wize: the more water you drink the less hungry you will be, and it also helps flush out your system. Being well hydrated can do WONDERS.<br>  <br>  Green tea is another great natural diet drink. It is an antidetoxiant so will help to flush out your system of crap it doesn't want/need, as well as speed up your metabolism to help you burn calories faster.<br>  <br>  Pomegranite is another great thing to be drinking. Healthy, lots of energy and nutrients, while being an antidetoxant.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you cut out junk food, sugary drinks and other crap and stock your house with easy, fast healthy items you won't need expensive diet drinks!|`|cTsRyAbBaa	slim fast (:|`|1295e34d28d9ad8c7187f4e91aaa29b1aa	no
9fsBstvDaa	Ace, or NPTI or even go to a gym and get the names of their certified trainers. Interview them and make sure they understand your fitness goals.<br>  <br>  All trainers in gyms have certifications. Most of the trainers that are house trainers are often new to the buisness. It does not mean they are not good, just green. Just make sure you get a trainer with references that you can afford to stick with to achieve your goals. You can also hire a trainer to design a program for you and take you through and then review and tweek the routine bi weekly or monthly. It depends on you and your motivation etc.<br>  <br>  I am not a fan of 24 hour fitness, LA fitness etc gyms.|`|DcI26pyKaa	The best thing to do if u can afford it and don't mind working out with people around is to join 24hr fitness. They are open 24 hrs a day so no matter your schedule u will always be able to workout and the personal trainers will also help u with your nutrition and supplementation which is actually the most important part of losing weight and getting in shape.<br>  <br>  Personally i go to L.A fitness it's a little pricier and more restrictive on hours of operation but they have a much better and cleaner facility and better membership crowd just from personal experience i am not sure if it's the same in CA.<br>  <br>  Just a word of advice they will try offer u the most expensive package when u go there so hold out until the guy basically lets u leave because by then he would have thrown out the lowest deal possible.<br>  <br>  Ps Just a word of advice and something that is really overlooked and I'm not sure if a trainer will share this with u is make sure u drink a min of 64 ounces of water everyday even when not working out it flushed out toxins that make u gain weight amongst other countless health benefits and don't drink alcohol because it's sugar in the end. If u can't resist drinking then don't eat junk when u do because everything u eat when u drink is stored as fat because the body wont burn it it sees the alcohol as poison and shuts down everything else to get it out of your system.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TYFSWhh3aa	dont think about sexual thing (to make it go down) OR wear tighter underwear like briefs.
FT2dOlZEaa	Huge.<br>  <br>  The ‘average’ length of an erect adult penis is about 5.5" - 6".<br>  <br>  It’s worth remembering that the average adult penis is 'designed' to fit the average depth of the adult vagina which is also about 6". <br>  <br>  There is no normal or average size for a soft/flaccid penis because they vary enormously. Some guys ‘shrink’ a lot more than others when soft. You can NEVER judge how big a guy will be when he is erect from his soft penis size.<br>  <br>  The ‘average’ girth of an erect adult penis, that is the distance AROUND the penis measured at the thickest point, is about 5". Anywhere between 4.7” and 5.2” is normal. <br>  <br>  Most penis growth happens between the ages of 12 and 16 with a subsequent slower rate of growth until the age of 17 or 18. Sometimes up till about 24 or 25yo.<br>  <br>  Approximate lengths for under 18’s are:<br>  At the beginning of puberty 2.4” <br>  12 to 13 ....... 3.0" to 4.0”<br>  14 to 15 ....... 4.0" to 5.0”<br>  16 to 17 ....... 5.0" to 6.0”<br>  <br>  To convert to cm, just multiply the number in inches by 2.54cm. For example, 5 X 2.54 = 12.7 So a 5" penis is 12.7cm
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Eat 1200-1600 calories, no over. No under. Exercise an hour a day 3 times a week. start off slow though at 30 mins 3 times a week. Eventually try for 5 times a week of an hour each and you'll lose 2-3 pounds a week|`|H9J7dCpAaa	The pattern for losing those extra pounds is easy - consume less food and exercise more - the problems arise when we actually try to put that into operation! There are plenty of temptations out there aren't there?! The only diet which really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I worked off 20 pounds, it really does produce success!|`|pzeHxEl9aa	Cut out bread and sugary drinks and sweets. This should at least make you lose 1 pound. My other contraversial way is to wear fewer clothes as you will use more energy keeping warm. That will be another pound and finally try and do some more exercise, I’m not talking about running, swimming or any sport which is good but is sometimes embarrassing but good for you try walking somewhere rather than getting the bus or a lift. <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Andy :D

xmibEEdcaa	It's not the oxycodone you have to worry about so much as it is the Tylenol.<br>  <br>  Your oxycodone is probably mixed with something.  Most likely you have Percocet, which is oxycodone mixed with Tylenol.  Look closely at your medicine bottle.  It will probably say something like "oxycodone/APAP 7.5-500."<br>  <br>  That second number, the "APAP," is the amount of acetaminophen (Tylenol) in each of your pills.  You should never take more than 1000mg of Tylenol at once, and never more than 4000mg a day. You really don't want to OD on Tylenol, or even risk taking too much of it over time. It causes liver failure, which is a slow and nasty way to die.<br>  <br>  If your pain pills aren't doing it for you anymore, that means you're building up a tolerance, so more oxycodone probably won't hurt you. But more Percocet *will.*  You should talk to your doctor about getting stronger pills, rather than taking more of the ones you have now.|`|GWyKZ3aiaa	As many as your doctor has perscribed you to take and no more. This is a controlled substance and very addictive, so your doctor has given it to you for a temporary pain management solution. You should take it as perscribed.

KjQaxGX0aa	Hi as someone said you are wearing to many layers and your height of 5'11' is impressive and that makes you special.  What do you really want to hear?  Does it really matter how much you weigh you are tall and carry it well.  You ask are you fat. Fat is a word which is used so much out of context.  It is everywhere in the media, in everyday speak. <br>  It is a simple word and one of the meanings is an overabundance of flesh which you don't have.  It perplexes me in western society why some women in particular strive to be a certain shape, size etc.  <br>  Loosing weight is about commitment and a change in lifestyle.  A healthy diet combined with regular moderate exercise.  Did you know that some of those fad diets can do real harm to people.  When the brain and body don't get the right nutrients they suffer terribly.  Imagine anyone young or old who crash diets constantly or becomes anorexic for some it is a dead end street.  Some people are so driven that they won't listen to reason and their way it the only way. Problems occur with the heart, organ failure, fainting, disorientation, etc.  I know of cases where taking laxatives is normal, the problem is, for someone who isn't eating properly the laxatives have nothing to work with no fibre etc.  Some people are literally being eaten by their own bodies and it can only take so much.  You really don't seem to have a problem so I don't even know why you are asking the question.  Are you insecure or has someone said something.  Be happy you are tall.<br>  Don't worry too much about things, you also didn't give your age which can have a lot to do with your question.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ch3cnSTzaa	No. you're just right.|`|xqQO81Omaa	I'll guess about 175lb considering your height.|`|CDM8yvmCaa	um i think you look average. 5 11' isn't that really tall? lucky. <br>  <br>  I think you weigh 65?
